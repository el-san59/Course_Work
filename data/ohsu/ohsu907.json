We measured plasma levels of free and esterified carnitine in 20 patients from our neurological intensive care unit who required intravenous or tube feeding. After 2-3 weeks 19 patients showed a 30%-60% decrease in the levels of serum free and total carnitine. As soon as oral feeding was recommenced, carnitine levels quickly returned to normal. These data suggest the need for new carnitine-enriched feeding fluids, which are presently under investigation.\r"

Liquid ventilation was performed without difficulty in each infant for two 3- to 5-minute cycles by means of gravity-assisted technique. Marked improvement in lung distensibility, without a change in cardiovascular status, occurred in all three infants after liquid ventilation; oxygenation improved in two. All infants died within 19 hours of liquid ventilation, and there was no evidence of retained perfluorochemical fluid in the lungs or pleural space. Death was probably related to the severity of lung disease before the initiation of liquid ventilation. This satisfactory initial outcome shows the feasibility and potential of this treatment of pulmonary dysfunction in the preterm neonate.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of cerebral blood flow to acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was determined during the first day of life in 19 severely asphyxiated term infants supported by mechanical ventilation. For comparison, 12 infants without perinatal asphyxia were also investigated. Global cerebral blood flow (CBF infinity) was determined by xenon 133 clearance two or three times within approximately 2 hours. During the cerebral blood flow measurement, the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram and visual-evoked potential were recorded. Changes in arterial carbon dioxide pressure followed adjustments of the ventilator settings, whereas MABP fluctuated spontaneously. Arterial oxygen pressure and blood glucose concentration were in the normal range. Five of the asphyxiated infants had isoelectric electroencephalograms and died subsequently with severe brain damage. They had a high CBF infinity (mean 30.6 ml/100 gm/min) and abolished carbon dioxide and MABP reactivity. Lower CBF infinity (mean 14.7 ml/100 gm/min) and abolished MABP reactivity were found in another five asphyxiated infants with burst-suppression electroencephalograms in whom computed tomographic or clinical signs of brain lesions developed. The carbon dioxide reactivity was preserved in these infants. In the remaining nine asphyxiated infants without signs of central nervous system abnormality, carbon dioxide and MABP reactivity were preserved, as was also the case in the control group. We conclude that abolished autoregulation is associated with cerebral damage in asphyxiated infants and that the combination of isoelectric electroencephalograms and cerebral hyperperfusion is an early indicator of very severe brain damage.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that increasing the calcium and phosphorus content of formulas for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to the level required to decrease the incidence of rickets has a negative impact on magnesium balance. Using formulas variously supplemented with these minerals, we measured absorption and retention in two groups of preterm infants: (1) VLBW infants, less than 1500 gm and at less than 32 weeks of gestational age, with 3-day mineral balances begun at days 10, 20, 30, and 40; and (2) low birth weight infants appropriately grown and at 32 to 34 weeks of gestational age, with a single 3-day balance begun at day 10. Magnesium did not affect calcium balance in VLBW or low birth weight infants but promoted phosphorus retention in VLBW infants from day 20 onward. Absorption and retention of magnesium increased with postnatal age in VLBW infants, but this effect was obvious only when calcium or phosphorus intakes were low or when magnesium intake was high. Calcium and phosphorus supplementation further reduced magnesium absorption and retention in VLBW infants to the extent that they were in negative balance throughout the study; however, magnesium supplementation improved absorption and retention in VLBW infants. The low birth weight infants absorbed and retained more magnesium than VLBW infants at the same postnatal age whether or not magnesium was supplemented. We conclude that magnesium deficits occur at currently recommended intakes of 10 mg/kg/day for VLBW infants with calcium and phosphorus intakes that allow retentions equivalent to in utero accretions; however, with magnesium intakes approaching 20 mg/kg/day, appropriate retention can be achieved.\r"

  ".U": "90317729\r", 
  ".W": "We studied retrospectively, 219 episodes of diabetic ketoacidemia in 119 patients aged 13 months to 30 years, to determine the trend of the concentration of sodium in serum as glucose declined during treatment of uncomplicated episodes and of episodes with complications attributable to brain swelling. Of 20 complication, 13 were minor (headache only) and 7 major (death or near death). The concentration of sodium in serum failed to rise as that of glucose declined in 82 (54%) of 164 uncomplicated episodes and in 18 (95%) of 20 complicated episodes (p less than 0.01). Hence complications were more likely to occur among patients with a failure of the concentration of sodium to rise as glucose declined. Fifty-eight episodes of diabetic ketoacidemia in 40 patients aged 1 1/2 to 20 years were then studied prospectively on a 48-hour treatment plan to provide the volume of deficit evenly, with half the deficit of sodium in the first 42 hours. Sodium concentration in serum rose in 55 (95%) of 58 episodes as that of glucose declined. No patient had a major complication. We conclude that failure of the sodium concentration measured in serum to rise as glucose concentration declines is a marker for excessive administration of free water. An expanded repair period, with repair fluid containing an average of 125 mmol/L Na+ early in therapy, will usually protect against a downward trend in the concentration of sodium in serum and therefore against a rapid decline in effective serum osmolality. This regimen may be protective against near-death episodes and brain herniation during treatment.\r"

This study assessed the hypothesis that A-subtype infections were more severe than B-subtype infections among the 157 infants hospitalized in two hospitals in Rochester, N.Y., during two winters. Severity was measured both by specific clinical observations and by a severity index that was derived empirically. Among all subjects, several clinical observations suggested that A-subtype infections were more severe. For example, mechanical ventilation was required in 12.6% of those with A-subtype compared with 1.6% of those with B-subtype infection (relative risk = 7.88; p = 0.01). Among high-risk infants (infants with underlying conditions or age 3 months or less at admission), carbon dioxide tension greater than 45 mm Hg was found in 37.0% of those with A-subtype compared with 12.0% of those with B-subtype infection (relative risk = 3.08; p = 0.04). In discrete multivariate (logit) analysis, effects of subtype (odds ratio = 6.59; p less than 0.01) on severity remained after adjustment for other statistically significant effects of age less than 3 months, underlying condition, and premature birth. The finding that A-subtype infections were more severe might have important implications for vaccine development, studies of the virulence of respiratory syncytial virus, clinical management (e.g., selection for antiviral therapy), and long-term prognosis.\r"

Tumor volume was represented as percent of tumor volume on day 0 and measured every other day from the administration of drug and/or the attainment of a minimum tumor volume of 0.5 cm3 on each side of the animal. Tumors in surgically castrated mice had significantly accelerated growth compared with control tumors grown in intact mice (1810 +/- 247.2 versus 1253.6 +/- 44.6%, respectively; P less than .05). Treatment with GnRH agonist significantly reduced tumor growth in intact mice at days 16, 18, and 20 compared with normal control tumors and placebo-treated tumors in intact mice (P less than .02). Gonadotropin levels in pooled serum of mice were reduced from normal levels with GnRH agonist treatment (control: mLH 16.9 +/- 2.2 ng/mL, mFSH 6.6 +/- 0.3 ng/mL; GnRH agonist-treated: mLH 9.3 +/- 1.8 ng/mL, mFSH 4.9 +/- 0.7 ng/mL; surgically castrated: mLH 32.2 +/- 2.7 ng/mL, mFSH 19.4 +/- 0.5 ng/mL). This human tumor model appears responsive to gonadotropins as evidenced by the ability of a GnRH agonist to inhibit growth of BG-1. These results suggest that GnRH agonist therapy may be a useful adjuvant in the treatment of human ovarian epithelial carcinoma.\r"

The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly increased (65.9%) after repeated incisions of tongue carcinomas. Three gray whole-body irradiation also increased the rate of metastasis from 31.0% to 46.3%. Higher incidences of lymphatic vessel invasion after incision and concomitant lymph node metastasis in the lymphatic invasion-positive group indicated a stepwise relationship leading to an increase in lymph node metastasis after incision. Because of the high incidence of metastases and close resemblance to human carcinomas in the tumor cell deposition and establishment of metastatic foci, DMBA-induced tongue carcinoma with invasion may serve as an experimental model of human oral carcinomas.\r"

The craniofacial abnormalities include coarse facies, mandibular condylar hypoplasia, retarded tooth eruption, and cystic jaw radiolucencies--particularly about the molars. Corneal clouding may lead to blindness but, in contrast to some other mucopolysaccharidoses, mental handicap is rare in Scheie syndrome. Cardiac valve incompetence is common, as are recurrent respiratory infections. Two brothers with Hurler-Scheie syndrome are presented and the oral and systemic complications each patient had described.

Twelve percent of the patients became colonized with P. aeruginosa before the age of 1 year and 44% by the age of 7 years. In a birth cohort followed from diagnosis during the study period, 23% were colonized with P. aeruginosa before age 1 year and 67% before age 7 years. Early P. aeruginosa colonization was associated with early diagnosis of CF. Presence of meconium ileus, gastrointestinal symptoms and pancreatic insufficiency at the time of diagnosis was also associated with early colonization. There was no association between the presence of respiratory symptoms at the time of diagnosis and age at first P. aeruginosa colonization. In families in which more than one sibling had CF, the age of P. aeruginosa acquisition was similar in the first colonized and the subsequently colonized siblings. In the year before the colonization patients with P. aeruginosa who were older than 1 year had higher rates of hospitalization and spent more days in hospital compared with patients without P. aeruginosa. In conclusion most P. aeruginosa colonization occurs at a younger age than previously reported. Early age at diagnosis and presence of CF-associated gastrointestinal abnormalities increase the likelihood of earlier colonization of P. aeruginosa.\r"

Differential plaque hybridization identified a cDNA, designated m119, that detected a 1.6-kilobase mRNA that accumulated in response to gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) but not in response to other macrophage activators, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and lipopolysaccharide. The mRNA encoded a predicted protein of Mr 14,461 containing a 21-amino acid signal peptide. The primary structure of the predicted protein indicated that it is a member of a recently described family of cytokines related to platelet factor 4, including Gro/melanoma growth stimulatory activity and neutrophil-activating peptide/interleukin 8. The selective induction of the m119 mRNA by IFN-gamma that the predicted m119 protein mediates a macrophage activity regulated by IFN-gamma.

  ".W": "The visual cortex in primates consists of an array of anatomically and chemically identifiable cellular modules (hypercolumns) with distinct physiological properties. For example, layers II/III in the macaque monkey contain a regular array of cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs. Furthermore, the surrounding cytochrome oxidase-poor interblob regions have a higher density of neuropeptide Y-positive aspiny stellate cells. Neurons in the blobs are thought to mediate predominantly low spatial frequencies and color vision, while those in the interblobs appear to be engaged in pattern vision and high spatial frequency analysis. In this study we examined the role of the retina in the development of hypercolumns. A bilateral retinal ablation was performed in embryos at midgestation, before any photoreceptors had established contacts with other retinal neurons and before layers II/III of the cortex--or their synaptic connection--had been generated. We found that the cortex in operated animals had cytochrome oxidase blobs and that their size and spacing were normal. In addition, neuropeptide Y-containing neurons were preferentially distributed in the interblob region as in control animals. Our findings indicate that some basic aspects of the cyto- and chemoarchitectonic organization of the cerebral cortex, which presumably evolved for the analysis of form and color, can emerge in the absence of cues from the retinal photoreceptors that mediate these attributes of vision.\r"

  ".W": "To create antibody molecules with improved functional properties, a growth factor (insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF1) was used to replace the constant region of a chimeric mouse-human IgG3 anti-dansyl antibody. The chimeric heavy chain was expressed with an anti-dansyl-specific chimeric kappa light chain. The IgG3-IGF1 chimeric protein retained its specificity for the antigen dansyl. The chimeric proteins bound to the IGF1 receptors of the human lymphoblast IM-9, albeit with reduced affinity, and elicited some of the same biologic effects (increased glucose and amino acid uptake) in human KB cells as did human IGF1, but with reduced specific activity. The reduced affinity and biologic activity may result from several things: the presence of the unprocessed IGF1 moiety, the large size of the IgG3-IGF1 chimeric protein (160 kDa) compared with IGF1 (7 kDa), and three amino acid substitutions in rat IGF1 compared with human IGF1, which may lead to decreased affinity for the human IGF1 receptor. The chimeric proteins show that it is feasible to produce a new family of immunotherapeutic molecules targeted to growth factor receptors.\r"

In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in signaling by the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI). Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) led to the phosphorylation of several proteins on tyrosine, the most prominent having a mass of 72 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation was rapid, detectable 1 min after stimulation, and correlated with both the time course and antigen dose for histamine release. Reversal of Fc epsilon RI cross-linking prevented continuation of the degranulation process and resulted in rapid loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. The receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation was still induced in the absence of calcium in the medium. Depletion of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not dramatically affect the tyrosine phosphorylation signal or the release of histamine. In contrast, the calcium ionophore A23187 induced histamine release in the absence of a perceptible increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal following Fc epsilon RI aggregation, independent of the exocytotic process itself. Taken together, our findings functionally link protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues to Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction leading to histamine release.\r"

Infection of human thymidine kinase-minus (TK-) 143 cells in culture with this recombinant virus resulted in production of 0.3 nmol of cytochrome b5 per mg of cell lysate protein. The expressed cytochrome had a reduced difference spectrum with a Soret peak at 424 nm, typical of pure cytochrome b5. TK- 143 cells have little detectable endogenous cytochrome b5, cytochrome P-450 (P450), and NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase. To test whether cytochrome b5 potentiated mixed-function monooxygenation in situ, these cells were coinfected with three recombinant vaccinia viruses individually carrying cDNAs encoding cytochrome b5, NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase, and P450 form IIB1. These triple-virus-infected cells were compared to cells infected with the P450IIB1 and NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase recombinant viruses with respect to P450IIB1-catalyzed monooxygenase activities. Cytochrome b5 specifically augmented the deethylation of p-nitrophenetole in microsomal membrane fractions of infected cells or when substrate was incubated directly with cells in situ. No significant increases were seen with P450IIB1-catalyzed testosterone, 7-ethoxycoumarin, or 7-pentoxyresorufin oxidations. These data demonstrate that cytochrome b5 is capable of specifically augmenting monooxygenase activities in intact cells.\r"

  ".U": "90319126\r", 
  ".W": "von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common hereditary disorder characterized by neural crest-derived tumors, particularly benign neurofibromas whose malignant transformation to neurofibrosarcomas can be fatal. The NF1 gene has been mapped to a small region of chromosome 17q, but neither the nature of the primary defect nor the mechanisms involved in tumor progression are understood. We have tested whether NF1 might be caused by the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene on 17q, analogous to that on chromosome 22 in NF2, by searching for deletions of chromosome 17 in NF1-derived tumor specimens. Both neurofibrosarcomas from patients with \"atypical\" NF and 5 of 6 neurofibrosarcomas from NF1 patients displayed loss of alleles for polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 17. However, the common region of deletion was on 17p and did not include the NF1 region of 17q. Since no loss of markers on chromosome 17 was observed in any of 30 benign tumors from NF1 patients, the 17p deletions seen in neurofibrosarcomas are probably associated with tumor progression and/or malignancy. This region contains a candidate gene for tumor progression, p53, which has recently been implicated in the progression of a broad array of human cancers. In a preliminary search for p53 aberrations by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA from 7 neurofibrosarcomas, 2 tumors that contained point mutations in exon 4 of the p53 gene were found, suggesting a role for this gene in at least some neurofibrosarcomas. Thus the formation of malignant neurofibrosarcomas may result from several independent genetic events including mutation of the NF1 gene, whose mechanism of tumorigenesis remains uncertain, and subsequent loss of a \"tumor suppressor\" gene on 17p, most likely p53.\r"

  ".U": "90319127\r", 
  ".W": "The recently discovered macrolide FK506 has been demonstrated to have potent immunosuppressive activity at concentrations 100-fold lower than cyclosporin A, a cyclic undecapeptide that is used to prevent rejection after transplantation of bone marrow and organs, such as kidney, heart, and liver. After the recent discovery that the cyclosporin A-binding protein cyclophilin is identical to peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, a cellular binding protein for FK506 was found to be distinct from cyclophilin but to have the same enzymatic activity. In this study, we isolated a cDNA coding for FK506-binding protein (FKBP) from human peripheral blood T cells by using mixed 20-mer oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the basis of the sequence, Glu-Asp-Gly-Lys-Lys-Phe-Asp, reported for bovine FKBP. The DNA isolated contained an open reading frame encoding 108 amino acid residues. The first 40 residues of the deduced amino acid sequence were identical to those of the reported amino-terminal sequence of bovine FKBP, indicating that the DNA sequence isolated represents the gene coding for FKBP. Computer-assisted analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicates that FKBP exhibits no internal homology and does not have significant sequence similarity to any other amino acid sequences of known proteins, including cyclophilin. This result suggests that two catalytically similar proteins, cyclophilin and FKBP, evolved independently. In Northern blot analysis, mRNA species of approximately 1.8 kilobases that hybridized with human FKBP cDNA were detected in poly(A)+ RNAs from brain, lung, liver, and placental cells and leukocytes. Induction of Jurkat leukemic T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin did not affect the level of FKBP mRNA. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA digested with different restriction enzymes suggests the existence of only a few copies of the DNA sequence encoding FKBP. This is in contrast to the result that as many as 20 copies of the cyclophilin gene and possible pseudogenes may be present in the mammalian genome.\r"

  ".U": "90319128\r", 
  ".W": "Rabbits of the Alicia strain have a mutation (ali) that segregates with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (lgh) locus and has a cis effect upon the expression of heavy-chain variable-region (VH) genes encoding the a2 allotype. In heterozygous a1/ali or a3/ali rabbits, serum immunoglobulins are almost entirely the products of the normal a1 or a3 allele and only traces of a2 immunoglobulin are detectable. Adult homozygous ali/ali rabbits likewise have normal immunoglobulin levels resulting from increased production of a-negative immunoglobulins and some residual ability to produce the a2 allotype. By contrast, the majority of the immunoglobulins of wild-type a2 rabbits are a2-positive and only a small percentage are a-negative. Genomic DNAs from homozygous mutant and wild-type animals were indistinguishable by Southern analyses using a variety of restriction enzyme digests and lgh probes. However, when digests with infrequently cutting enzymes were analyzed by transverse alternating-field electrophoresis, the ali DNA fragments were 10-15 kilobases smaller than the wild type. These fragments hybridized to probes both for VH and for a region of DNA a few kilobases downstream of the VH genes nearest the joining region. We suggest that this relatively small deletion affects a segment containing 3' VH genes with important regulatory functions, the loss of which leads to the ali phenotype. These results, and the fact that the 3' VH genes rearrange early in B-cell development, indicate that the 3' end of the VH locus probably plays a key role in regulation of VH gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "T cells play a crucial role in antibody-mediated and antibody-independent immunity against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Therefore, a vaccine immunogen should include parasite-derived B- and T-cell epitopes capable of giving rise to protective responses in both systems. The P. falciparum antigen Pf155/ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), a vaccine candidate, contains immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes located in the central (5') and C-terminal (3') invariant repeat regions of the molecule. To relate Pf155/RESA-peptide-specific responses of T cells to function, T cells from P. falciparum immune donors were activated with peptides corresponding to these immunodominant regions. Activation was measured as induction of interferon-gamma secretion, T-cell proliferation (DNA synthesis), or transcription and translation of interleukin 4 (IL-4) mRNA. Peptides from both regions were shown to induce interferon-gamma, IL-4, proliferation, or any combination. In individual donors, there was no correlation between these different activities. Rather, they were negatively correlated, demonstrating the importance of examining multiple parameters of T-cell activation when estimating the proportion of individuals responding to a given epitope. However, IL-4 mRNA and intracellular IL-4 could be induced in T cells of donors who had elevated concentrations of serum antibodies to the same peptide that was used for T-cell activation. These results suggest that a causal relationship exists between the activation of IL-4-producing T-cell subsets and production of the anti-Pf155/RESA-specific antibodies in individuals in which immunity has been induced by natural infection. This finding has implications that should be considered for the selection of immunogens to be included in a future P. falciparum subunit vaccine and for vaccine development in general.\r"

This resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in PTPase activity over endogenous levels. The PTPase blocked the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues on endogenous proteins, including a protein having a molecular mass in the same range as the beta subunit of the insulin or insulin-like growth factor I receptor. PTPase 1B also blocked the activation of an S6 peptide kinase--i.e., an enzyme recognizing a peptide having the sequence RRLSSLRA found in a segment of ribosomal protein S6 and known to be activated early in response to insulin. On the other hand, the insulin stimulation of an S6 kinase, detected by using 40S ribosomes as substrate, was unaffected even though PTPase 1B partially prevented the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vivo. Mono Q chromatography of insulin-treated oocyte extracts revealed two main peaks of S6 kinase activity. Fractions from the first peak displayed S6 peptide kinase activity that was essentially abolished in profiles from PTPase 1B-injected oocytes. Material from the second peak, which was best revealed by using 40S ribosomes as substrate and had comparatively little S6 peptide kinase activity, was minimally affected by PTPase 1B. These observations suggest that at least two distinct \"S6 kinases\" are involved in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in vivo and that the activation pathways for these enzymes differ in their sensitivity to PTPase 1B.\r"

Probes used previously to study the TFIIIA-DNA complex do not react with every nucleotide of DNA, unlike hydroxyl radical, which cleaves DNA at every backbone position.

Similar calcium-dependent proteolytic processing of pre-IL-1 alpha was also observed with lysates of either LPS-activated human adherent mononuclear cells or HTB9 5637 cells. Since the optimal pH for processing was between 7 and 8, and E-64 (a cysteine protease inhibitor) and leupeptin (a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor) both inhibited this processing by cell lysates, we hypothesized that a calcium-activated neutral protease, CANP, might be responsible for this processing. This hypothesis was supported by data showing that the specific CANP inhibitor peptide inhibited this proteolysis in cell lysates in a dose-dependent fashion (IC50 = 0.05 microM) and that treatment of pre-IL-1 alpha with purified CANP yielded the 17-kDa mature form of IL-1 alpha, which has an amino terminus identical with that reported for mature human IL-1 alpha. Taken together, these findings indicate that calcium-dependent proteolytic processing of pre-IL-1 alpha is selectively mediated by CANP.\r"

  ".W": "The general applicability of the \"cysteine-switch\" activation mechanism to the members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family is examined here. All currently known members of the MMP gene family share the characteristic that they are synthesized in a latent, inactive, form. Recent evidence suggests that this latency in human fibroblast collagenase (HFC) is the result of formation of an intramolecular complex between the single cysteine residue in its propeptide domain and the essential zinc atom in the catalytic domain, a complex that blocks the active site. Latent HFC can be activated by multiple means, all of which effect the dissociation of the cysteine residue from the complex. This is referred to as the \"cysteine-switch\" mechanism of activation. The propeptide domain that contains the critical cysteine residue and the catalytic domain that contains the zinc-binding site are the only two domains common to all of the MMPs. The amino acid sequences surrounding both the critical cysteine residue and a region of the protein chains containing two of the putative histidine zinc-binding ligands are highly conserved in all of the MMPs. A survey of the literature shows that many of the individual MMPs can be activated by the multiple means observed for latent HFC. These observations support the view that the cysteine-switch mechanism is applicable to all members of this gene family. This mechanism is unprecedented in enzymology as far as we know and offers the opportunity for multiple modes of physiological activation of these important enzymes. Since conditions in different cells and tissues may match those necessary to effect one of these activation modes for a given MMP, this may offer metabolic flexibility in the control of MMP activation.\r"

  ".W": "A debate has recently surfaced concerning the degree of precommitment attained by alpha beta and gamma delta T-cell precursors prior to T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. It has been suggested that precursors may be precommitted to rearrange either alpha or delta genes, but not both, thus giving rise to alpha beta- and gamma delta-producing T cells, respectively. Alternatively, the precursors may be flexible with regard to potential TCR gene rearrangements. To address this controversy, the gene rearrangements among a group of T-cell hybridomas from fetal, newborn, and early postnatal mouse thymi were examined. Six probes spanning the delta and alpha loci were used in Southern blot analyses to characterize the rearrangements which occurred on homologous chromosomes in each cell. Although homologous chromosomes often rearranged in synchrony within the alpha locus, a number of hybridomas were found which had retained a delta rearrangement on one chromosome and an alpha rearrangement on the second. Results show that a precommitment by T cells to rearrange delta or alpha genes in a mutually exclusive manner is not an absolute feature of mouse thymocyte development.\r"

The DBD is found to consist of a globular body from which the finger regions extend. A model of the dimeric complex between the DBD and the glucocorticoid response element is proposed.

The ras-specific and Krev-1-specific amino acids immediately surrounding residues 32 to 44, which are identical between the two proteins, determined whether the protein induced cellular transformation or suppressed ras transformation. Because this region in Ras proteins has been implicated in effector function, the results suggest that Krev-1 suppresses ras-induced transformation by interfering with interaction of Ras with its effector.\r"

The protein product of Krev-1, Rap1A-p21, is identical to Ras-p21 proteins in the region where interaction with guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) is believed to occur. Therefore, the ability of GAP to interact with Rap1A-p21 was tested. Rap1A-p21 was not activated by GAP but bound tightly to GAP and was an effective competitive inhibitor of GAP-mediated Ras-GTPase activity. Binding of GAP to Rap1A-p21 was strictly guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent. The ability of Rap1A-p21 to bind tightly to GAP may account for Krev-1 suppression of transformation by ras. This may occur by preventing interaction of GAP with Ras-p21 or with other cellular proteins necessary for GAP-mediated Ras GTPase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities in multiple tissues derived from the neural crest. No reliable cellular phenotypic marker has been identified, which has hampered direct efforts to identify the gene. The chromosome location of the NF1 gene has been previously mapped genetically to 17q11.2, and data from two NF1 patients with balanced translocations in this region have further narrowed the candidate interval. The use of chromosome jumping and yeast artificial chromosome technology has now led to the identification of a large (approximately 13 kilobases) ubiquitously expressed transcript (denoted NF1LT) from this region that is definitely interrupted by one and most likely by both translocations. Previously identified candidate genes, which failed to show abnormalities in NF1 patients, are apparently located within introns of NF1LT, on the antisense strand. A new mutation patient with NF1 has been identified with a de novo 0.5-kilobase insertion in the NF1LT gene. These observations, together with the high spontaneous mutation rate of NF1 (which is consistent with a large locus), suggest that NF1LT represents the elusive NF1 gene.\r"

  ".U": "90320530\r", 
  ".W": "The search for better radiopaque iodinated contrast material for intravascular use is continuing, but the recent development of new lower osmolality contrast media (LOCM), both ionic and nonionic, has dramatically affected the practice of radiology. The major issue retarding the introduction of LOCM into clinical practice in this country has been the increased cost of the media. Numerous preliminary assumptions and probabilities about the tolerance, efficacy, and overall safety of LOCM have been documented in scientific studies. The lower osmolality, reduced chemotoxicity, and high hydrophilicity of new compounds, particularly the nonionic variety compared with conventional high osmolality ionic agents (HOCM), offer a significant margin of safety to patients with known risk factors. Mounting data suggest that low or no risk patients are benefited as well, perhaps to an even greater degree. Costly trade-offs to the universal use of LOCM exist, therefore careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of LOCM for intravascular administration is required. This article, presented as the Preston M. Hickey Memorial Lecture to the Michigan Radiological Society in March of 1990, explores the historical development of iodinated intravascular contrast media, especially LOCM, and cites existing data that form the basis for various strategies for their use, that is, selective, universal, or nonvascular use. Better, safer, and less expensive contrast media are a realistic expectation in this new decade of technological promise. Reducing adverse side effects from the use of any new drug or technology must be our continued, collective goal.\r"

The vast majority of scientific reports on the value of sonography for imaging musculoskeletal abnormalities have been written only in the last decade. Sonography has several inherent advantages: it is relatively inexpensive, allows comparison with the opposite normal side, uses no radiation, and can be performed at bedside or in the operating room if necessary. The advent of MR imaging has revolutionized musculoskeletal imaging and may be used in many instances rather than sonography for evaluating the same abnormalities or anatomic structures. It is important, however, to keep in perspective what the different imaging techniques have to offer, and, if one is just as efficacious as the other, the least invasive and least expensive should be chosen whenever possible. The goal of this article is to review the applications of sonography to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders including tendon disease, soft-tissue masses, identification of foreign bodies, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and certain joint abnormalities.\r"

Patency, atresia, or hypoplasia of central pulmonary arteries and postoperative complications (focal stenoses of pulmonary arteries, thrombosed conduit, peri-conduit abscess) were shown. Narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract and focal compression of the proximal pulmonary arteries were recognized as specific complications of the Jatene procedure.

CT scans showed necrotic nodes in 16 patients (21%). The difference between these patients and those without necrotic nodes was not statistically significant with respect to sex, age, stage, distribution of disease, presence of E disease, cell type, mass diameter, or the presence of bulk disease (mass diameter/maximal thoracic diameter greater than or equal to 0.33). The mass volume as measured by CT was not significantly (p = .08) larger (1274 cm3) than the group without necrotic nodes (876 cm3). An analysis of the various mediastinal sites involved showed no difference between patients with and without necrotic nodes. Lastly, the presence of necrotic nodes had no significant impact on patients' clinical response to treatment or survival. The presence of mediastinal necrotic nodes appears to have little radiologic or prognostic significance in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin disease.\r"

All patients had surgery and 44 had pathologic examination of the mediastinal and celiac lymph nodes. The results of CT and endoscopic sonography were compared with surgical and pathologic findings. A total of 51 tumors were found in 46 patients. Sonographic estimation of tumor extension through the different layers of the esophagus was correct in 37 (73%) of all 51 tumors and in 22 (85%) of the 26 tumors in which the examination was complete. The echoendoscope (13-mm diameter) could not pass through the tumor in 23 cases (50%). Infiltration to adjacent organs was found in 15 cases at surgery. In four of these 15, the extension was detected by CT; in seven of the 15 cases, it was detected by sonography. False-negative determination of tumor extension occurred with endoscopic sonography in patients with stenotic tumor. There were no false-positive results with either CT or endoscopic sonography. For detection of mediastinal lymph-node involvement, the sensitivity of CT was 48%. The sensitivity of sonography was 50% if metastatic nodes unexplored by sonography were included, or 84% if only cases in which stenosis was passed were considered. Statistical comparison revealed that sonography was superior to CT for the detection of metastases to lymph nodes. CT and endoscopic sonography provide complementary information. When the echoendoscope can be maneuvered past the tumor, sonography can be used accurately to define extension through the layers of the esophagus, extension to the adjacent organs, and involvement of the lymph nodes. When the tumor cannot be passed by the echoendoscope, CT is superior to sonography for detection of mediastinal extension.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the sonographic features of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis of the cecum and ascending colon, the sonographic findings in 534 patients who presented with right lower quadrant pain were reviewed. Of these, 18 patients had uncomplicated acute diverticulitis of the cecum and ascending colon. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgery (one patient), clinical course (17 patients), CT (eight patients), or contrast enema (11 patients). On sonography, a round or oval focus of varying echogenicity, which protruded from a segmentally thickened colonic wall and was surrounded by a hyperechoic area, was seen in all 18 patients. These were hypoechoic foci (12 patients), hypoechoic foci with internal strong echoes (three patients), and echogenic shadowing foci with surrounding hypoechoic bands (three patients). Extraluminal gas (one patient) and thickening of lateroconal fascia (six patients) were seen also. Findings of enlarged appendix, frank abscess, and ascites were absent. All patients, including the one who had laparotomy, were successfully treated medically for diverticulitis. Of 515 patients without diverticulitis, in only one patient with acute appendicitis did sonography show a hypoechoic protruding focus. Our experience indicates that the major sonographic finding in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis of the right colon is a hypoechoic round or oval focus protruding from a segmentally thickened colonic wall.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to assess the significance of diastolic flow reversal seen on duplex Doppler sonograms of patients with renal transplant dysfunction. Earlier studies have evaluated the causes of increased vascular resistance in renal transplants. None, however, have investigated specifically the subset of patients in whom impedance in the renal microcirculation has increased to the degree that retrograde arterial flow is present. In our series, 533 consecutive scans in 270 patients were reviewed. The patients were referred for evaluation of renal transplant dysfunction during a 25-month period. Doppler samples were obtained from main, segmental, and, when possible, arcuate arteries. An episode of reversed diastolic flow was identified in nine patients. Correlation was made with clinical, laboratory, histologic (biopsy in six patients, nephrectomy in three patients), and imaging studies (DTPA scintigraphy in seven patients, angiography in one patient). On the basis of histologic and nephrectomy results, we determined that among the nine patients, four had acute tubular necrosis, three had acute rejection, and two had renal vein thrombosis. One of these patients had both severe rejection and renal vein thrombosis. One additional patient had neither biopsy nor nephrectomy and was not included in the diagnostic groups listed here. Our study suggests that reversed diastolic flow is not specific for either acute rejection or acute tubular necrosis. Reversal of diastolic flow, however, is a poor prognostic sign; nephrectomy was imminent in three of the nine patients. Furthermore, two (22%) patients had renal vein thrombosis, whereas renal vein thrombosis was not found in any of the 261 patients without reversed diastolic flow. Duplex Doppler examinations with reversed diastolic flow should suggest renal vein thrombosis.\r"

We studied the excretory urograms of 280 patients with nephrolithiasis and 280 patients without either nephrolithiasis or a history of renal stones to determine the frequencies of medullary sponge kidney in the two groups. The criterion for the diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney was the presence of a minimum of three linear or round collections of contrast material within one renal papilla. In the patients with nephrolithiasis, we also looked for biochemical evidence of metabolic causes of renal stones. The frequency of medullary sponge kidney was 12% in patients with nephrolithiasis compared with 1% in patients without nephrolithiasis. The statistical difference was highly significant (chi square = 27.1; p less than .001). Metabolic disorders accounting for the lithiasis were detected in 93% of the patients with stones without medullary sponge kidney. Such evidence was present in 60% of patients with stones and medullary sponge kidney. The statistical difference was significant (chi square = 25.8; p less than .001). Our results suggest that medullary sponge kidney is a cause of nephrolithiasis.\r"

In three, the sonograms had a distinctive appearance characterized by a hypoechoic lesion containing stippled areas of hyperechogenicity. This was not present in the other 24. The sonograms of all 27 patients were compared with whole-mount histopathologic sections of the radical prostatectomy specimens. This comparison showed that the distinctive sonographic abnormalities in these three patients were caused by foci of comedocarcinoma, an aggressive variant of prostatic carcinoma (Gleason pattern 5). In none of the other 24 patients were similar sonographic findings seen and none had comedocarcinoma at histopathologic examination. These findings suggest that a hypoechoic lesion containing diffuse, stippled echogenicity may be a sonographic sign of comedocarcinoma.\r"

Endovaginal sonography was diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy in 23 (38%) of the 60 patients with surgically proved ectopic pregnancies: transabdominal sonography was diagnostic in 13 patients (22%). All 83 intrauterine pregnancies were identified with endovaginal sonography, compared with 34 identified with transabdominal sonography. Endovaginal sonography was somewhat more helpful in the diagnosis of missed abortion and blighted ovum. Eighty endovaginal sonograms were classified as indeterminate as compared with 141 transabdominal studies. This indeterminate group included patients with complete abortions, ectopic pregnancies without sonographic evidence of an extrauterine gestation, incomplete abortions, and patients with subsequent negative serum levels. As in prior reports, endovaginal sonography was superior to transabdominal sonography in the evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancies. Overall, endovaginal sonography was diagnostic in 113 patients, whereas transabdominal sonography was diagnostic in 52 patients. The finding of an extrauterine fetal pole or embryo was diagnostic for an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic fluid, the appearance of the endometrium, and a single positive serum HCG determination were not helpful in making the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Kaposi sarcoma, a common opportunistic neoplasm complicating AIDS, is thought to arise from the vasculature and possibly from lymphatic endothelium. To evaluate the nature and extent of lymphatic involvement in AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, we used an improved technique of whole-body lymphangioscintigraphy. Six human-immunodeficiency-virus-seropositive men (40-51 years old) with AIDS and extensive Kaposi sarcoma had bilateral foot and/or hand intradermal injection of 0.05 ml of 99mTc-labeled human serum albumin (500 microCi, 18.5 MBq). After sequential whole-body scanning with a digital gamma camera, the findings were interpreted by comparing them with findings from similar studies in 30 other patients without AIDS or Kaposi sarcoma (26 with primary or secondary lymphedema and four with normal extremities). Unlike in normal limbs, where lymphangioscintigraphy displayed early lymphatic truncal and regional nodal filling with radionuclide, in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, lymphangioscintigraphy disclosed a variety of abnormal patterns with some features distinct and others resembling lymphatic dysplasia as seen in primary and secondary lymphedema. These included focal accumulation of tracer within lymphatic channels in the distribution of cutaneous Kaposi lesions; delayed tracer transport with absent, faint, or intense regional lymph nodal uptake; and retarded or impeded lymphatic drainage with tracer intensification in the region of Kaposi sarcoma plaques. The impaired lymphatic drainage and nodal dysfunction seen on scintigrams in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma suggest a close connection between the lymphatic system and this disorder.\r"

Although these diseases are rare, their differentiation can be clinically significant. While most of these tumors are treated by surgical excision, asymptomatic lipomatous uterine tumors and benign pelvic lipomas may require no therapy. Additionally, correct identification of a malignant lipomatous tumor will affect both prognosis and surgical planning. The purpose of this essay is to illustrate the imaging findings of these conditions.\r"

The specific symptoms depend on the extent of nerve involvement, and compression distal or proximal to the tarsal tunnel may result in variants of the syndrome. To define better the capability of MR imaging for evaluating this entity, we performed MR imaging on three normal subjects and correlated the images with cryomicrotome sections. Six patients with symptoms suggestive of tarsal tunnel syndrome also were studied with MR. In all normal subjects, MR images showed the flexor retinaculum and the structures passing deep to the retinaculum: the tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendon, flexor hallucis longus tendon, and the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle. The medial calcaneal sensory branch(es) and the medial and lateral plantar nerves also were delineated. Mechanical causes of compression were shown in all six symptomatic patients. The pathologic entities included two neurilemomas, tenosynovitis involving all three tendons, a ganglion cyst arising from the flexor hallucis longus tendon sheath, posttraumatic fibrosis, and post-traumatic fibrosis with associated posttraumatic neuroma. The MR findings were confirmed surgically in five cases. MR imaging can accurately depict the contents of the tarsal tunnel and the courses of the terminal branches of the posterior tibial nerve. In our small series, MR imaging accurately showed the lesions responsible for tarsal tunnel syndrome.\r"

It is an important finding because it often influences therapeutic decisions. However, acute synovitis may be difficult to detect by clinical examination, especially if a joint effusion also is present. As gadolinium tetra-azacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA) can be expected to accumulate in areas of acute inflammation, we studied the value of Gd-DOTA-enhanced MR to determine the presence of acute synovitis. Nine patients with current knee symptoms underwent MR examination of the knee. Short and long TR/TE MR images were obtained with a 0.3-T magnet before and immediately after IV administration of Gd-DOTA. A 15-min delayed short TR/TE image also was obtained. Of eight patients with moderate to severe clinical evidence of acute synovitis, six had marked increase and two had moderate increase in signal intensity from synovial tissue on the short TR/TE image obtained immediately after administration of contrast material. In the ninth patient, who had minimal synovitis clinically, the signal from the synovium did not change after administration of contrast material. No difference was seen between the enhancement pattern on the immediate and the 15-min delayed images. These results suggest that Gd-DOTA is taken up by inflamed synovium and that Gd-DOTA-enhanced MR scans may be useful in detecting acute synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Eleven regularly used the jugular vein access, and three alternated between the jugular and femoral veins. Initial radiographs of the cervical spine in 13 patients showed destruction of two or more vertebral bodies and the adjacent intervertebral disk, as well as a prevertebral soft-tissue mass. In one patient, findings on initial radiographs were normal, but marked destruction at two contiguous intervertebral levels and a large prevertebral abscess were identified 2 weeks later. All the patients had positive results on cultures of joint aspirates or bone biopsy materials (10 patients) or blood (four patients). Ten grew Staphylococcus aureus; two, Staphylococcus epidermidis; one, Streptococcus viridans; and one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CT in nine patients showed inflammatory reaction adjacent to the carotid sheath resulting from the repeated jugular injections and delineated the extent of prevertebral abscess and bone destruction. Scintigrams were of minimal value in establishing the diagnosis. Advanced vertebral body destruction, disk space infection, prevertebral abscess, and anterior cervical inflammatory reaction appear to be typical findings on radiographs in heroin abusers with cervical osteomyelitis.\r"

The signal intensities of the soft-tissue and marrow components of the tumor were evaluated on T2-weighted images obtained in 10 patients (nine with responsive tumors) at presentation and during and immediately after completion of two cycles of chemotherapy. MR evidence of marrow and soft-tissue involvement was seen in all tumors at presentation. After treatment, the bone-marrow component of the nine drug-sensitive tumors showed an increase in signal intensity that in eight cases became comparable to that of water. Changes in signal intensity of the soft-tissue component were variable, consisting of increases in two of the responsive lesions, no change in three, a decrease in two, and complete resolution of the soft-tissue mass in two. There was no increase in signal intensity of either the bone-marrow or the soft-tissue component of the single nonresponsive tumor. All of the responsive tumors showed advanced healing, and abundant bony sclerosis was apparent on CT. Bone-marrow examinations, performed in seven of the nine patients with responsive lesions, disclosed no evidence of tumor in four. Two patients had residual extramedullary tumor; the nonresponsive lesion contained sheets of tumor cells. The increase in marrow signal intensity on T2-weighted images was associated with replacement of marrow elements by a loose, hypocellular myxoid matrix containing modest amounts of collagen, consistent with response to chemotherapy and eradication of disease. Therefore, an increase in the T2-weighted signal intensity of the bone-marrow component of Ewing sarcoma of bone reflected a favorable response to chemotherapy. MR signal changes, however, were not predictive of resolution of malignant disease within adjacent soft tissue.\r"

In no patient was there any clinical evidence of renal disease at the time of presentation. In 39 patients, sonographic and CT findings were similar (normal in 36 patients and showing extrinsic mass effects on the kidneys in three patients). In five patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma whose contrast-enhanced CT scans showed low-attenuation renal nodules, renal sonography was normal in two, showed renal enlargement in two, and showed a solitary hypoechoic nodule in one patient with multiple, bilateral nodules on CT. Tissue diagnosis of the renal lesions was not obtained, but in the four patients who had follow-up CT, the renal abnormalities resolved after chemotherapy. Our findings suggest that contrast-enhanced CT is superior to sonography for detection of renal lymphoma in children.\r"

Decisions regarding the need for sclerotherapy, palliative shunts, and anatomic suitability for hepatic transplantation are based on the upper abdominal anatomy. Thirty-six children with various forms of chronic liver disease were referred for diagnostic imaging, including MR and sonography. Each study was evaluated independently without knowledge of the other examination. The first six patients were evaluated retrospectively and the last 30 patients prospectively. The size of the portal vein and inferior vena cava varied in this population, with excellent agreement between sonography and MR. A 2-mm portal vein was shown only on MR imaging in two patients, but MR missed a 3-mm portal vein. Portosystemic collateral vessels also were evaluated and noted to be detected more readily with MR imaging (64%) than with sonography (22%). In particular, paraumbilical veins were detected more often with MR (28% vs 6% by sonography). Associated or coexisting anomalies were relatively common in children with chronic liver disease (14%). These included polysplenia (two cases), preduodenal portal vein (one), unilateral dysplastic kidneys (two), ureteropelvic junction obstruction (one), and splenic (one) and renal (one) cysts. MR imaging was more sensitive than sonography for detection of abnormal anatomy in this group of patients and should be considered the pretransplantation imaging technique of choice in children with end-stage liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "This study correlates the appearance of the cavernous segment of the carotid artery on MR images with the presence of significant stenosis or occlusion of the cervical carotid artery as seen on angiograms in 100 patients who had brain MR imaging and arteriography within a 1-week period. Four patients demonstrated isointense signal within the carotid artery's cavernous segment; two of these findings correlated with complete carotid occlusion as seen angiographically, while partial compromise was seen angiographically in the other two. Four other patients had variable signal intensity and irregularity of the luminal outline in the carotid siphon, correlating with angiographic evidence of atheromatous disease in three patients and of dissection in one patient. The demonstration of normal signal void within a normal-appearing cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery in the remaining 92 patients correlated with absence of significant stenosis within the cervical segment in 86 patients. In the remaining six, significant disease of the internal carotid artery was found. Isointensity within the intracranial carotid artery can indicate either complete occlusion or very slow flow. Therefore, angiography is still necessary to completely exclude potentially treatable disease that produces very slow flow leading to isointensity. The presence of normal flow void in the intracranial segment does not exclude significant compromise of the cervical segment of the carotid artery.\r"

Third ventricular tumors adjacent to the foramen of Monro (e.g., colloid cysts) were excluded. Forty-six patients underwent CT, and eight had MR imaging. The most common neoplasms were choroid plexus papilloma (10 cases) and meningioma (nine cases). Other common neoplasms included subependymoma (six cases), subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (five cases), and metastasis/lymphoma (four cases). Important features for differential diagnosis included age of the patient, the tumor's location within the lateral ventricle, and density on CT before IV administration of contrast material. Fifty percent of the tumors were in the ventricular atrium. All intraventricular tumor types (except subependymoma) showed contrast enhancement. MR was most useful in evaluating tumor location, size, and extent, but it did not help in eliminating alternative diagnoses. On the basis of patients' ages, specific tumor location, and the appearance on CT scans or MR images, an algorithm for differential diagnosis of lateral ventricular tumors was developed.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred patients with recently acquired, externally visible mandibular deformity and no history of previous extraarticular mandible fracture were selected for retrospective analysis. All had been investigated clinically and with radiography, tomography, and high-field surface-coil MR imaging to determine the presence or absence and extent of temporomandibular joint degeneration. Temporomandibular joint degeneration was found in either one or both joints of each patient studied. Chin deviation was always toward the smaller mandibular condyle or more diseased joint, and many patients either complained of or exhibited malocclusion, often manifested by unstable or fluctuating occlusion disturbances. Three radiologically distinct forms of degenerative vs adaptive osteocartilaginous processes--(1) osteoarthritis, (2) avascular necrosis, and (3) regressive remodeling--involving the mandibular condyle and temporal bone were identified in joints most often exhibiting meniscus derangement. Osteoarthritis and avascular necrosis of the mandibular condyle and temporal bone were generally associated with pain, mechanical joint symptoms, and occlusion disturbances. Regressive remodeling was less frequently associated with occlusion disturbances, despite remodeling of the facial skeleton, and appears to result from regional osteoporosis. Forty patients (52 joints) underwent open arthroplasty procedures, including either meniscectomy or microsurgical meniscus repair, at which time major radiologic diagnoses were confirmed. Surgical and pathologic findings included meniscus displacement, disk degeneration, synovitis, joint effusion, articular cartilage erosion, cartilage healing/fibrosis, cartilage hypertrophy, osseous sclerosis, osteophyte formation, osteochondritis dissecans, localized or extensive avascular necrosis, and decreased mandibular condyle mass and vertical dimension. We conclude that temporomandibular joint degeneration is the principal cause of both acquired facial skeleton remodeling and unstable occlusion in patients with intact dentition and without previous mandible fracture.\r"

However, these often occlude early and may be difficult to replace. We have reviewed our experience with percutaneous replacement of endoprostheses in 17 patients with 31 episodes of stent dysfunction. The stent was changed successfully in 30 of the 31 attempts. The average durations of initial and subsequent stent patencies were 28 and 20 weeks, respectively. Significant acute complications occurred in three patients, one of whom had a perihepatic abscess and two of whom had septicemia. Two patients died within 30 days of their last stent change. The one patient in whom attempted insertion of a new stent was unsuccessful had to remain on continuous external catheter drainage. The occluded or migrated endoprosthesis was successfully removed either percutaneously (55%) or endoscopically (26%) in 25 of the 31 cases. Successful removal of the stent and reinsertion after blockage or migration is possible in most patients. Our experience suggests that patients with malignant obstruction of the bile duct should not be refused an indwelling endoprosthesis just because of the frequent occurrence of early occlusion of the stent.\r"

We examined 100 consecutive CT scans of the thorax to assess both the number of internal mammary vessels and their relation to the sternum. The mean distance from the sternum to the most medial vessel, the internal mammary vein, was 1.03 +/- 0.25 cm on the right side and 0.98 +/- 0.23 cm on the left side. The mean distance from the sternum to the most lateral vessel, the internal mammary artery, was 1.57 +/- 0.30 cm on the right and 1.47 +/- 0.30 cm on the left. Three internal mammary vessels were present in 20% of cases on the right side and in 18% on the left side. In nine patients, the internal mammary artery was greater than 2.0 cm from the lateral border of the sternum. We recommend an approach that is greater than 2.5 cm from the sternal border when performing parasternal percutaneous transthoracic procedures in order to avoid hemorrhagic complications from injury to the internal mammary vessels. A \"safe\" window does exist medially between the sternal border and the internal mammary vein but should be used only in procedures performed under CT guidance.\r"

Hence, time-of-flight sequences for MR angiography in high-resistance peripheral vessels are successful only when applied in a plane perpendicular to the vessel course. When applied in a plane parallel to the vessel, the method suffers from the rapid saturation of the inflowing spins. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-polylysine is a new T1 relaxation agent with blood-pooling capability that can be used to prevent blood saturation. In the present study it produced excellent angiograms in rabbits at a dose of 0.01-0.08 mmol/kg injected IV. Time-of-flight angiograms were acquired in a 1.5-T superconducting magnet with a three-dimensional fast imaging with steady precession sequence, 20,40/10/20 degrees (TR/TE/flip angle), with an acquisition volume of 200 x 200 x 60 mm, 64 partitions, and velocity compensation in the slice-selection and frequency-encoding directions. Arteries and veins smaller than 1 mm were visualized over the entire length of the posterior limbs. If ongoing studies confirm the low toxicity of this new agent, gadopentetate dimeglumine-polylysine could offer a totally new approach to MR angiography.\r"

To study the impact of position on cardiopulmonary exercise response, 30 patients performed symptom-limited upright treadmill and supine bicycle ergometry exercise an average of 8 days after an AMI. The exercise sequence was randomly assigned with a minimum 4-hour interval between tests. Exercise time and peak oxygen consumption were significantly greater in the upright position (7.0 +/- 2.0 vs 5.6 +/- 2.0 minutes; p less than 0.001 and 14.9 vs 12.0 ml/min/kg; p less than 0.001, respectively). Compared to the supine position, exercise in the upright position was associated with a significant increased incidence of ischemic exercise-induced ST-segment depression (33 vs 20%; p less than 0.03), and chest pain (20 vs 10%; p less than 0.04). Thus, position is an important determinant of myocardial ischemic response and exercise tolerance in patients who perform symptom-limited exercise tests early after AMI.\r"

Between January 1987 and November 1989, 1 operator at a Veterans Administration center performed PTCA on 73 vessels in 56 patients with rest angina of sufficient severity to require intravenous nitroglycerin in all 56 and intraaortic balloon counter-pulsation (IABP) in 18. Of the 56 patients, 17 (30%) had 1-vessel disease, 14 (25%) had 2-vessel disease and 25 (45%) had 3-vessel disease; 14 (25%) had greater than or equal to 1 prior bypass surgery, 35 (62.5%) were within 30 days of an acute infarction, 12 (21%) had left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.50 and 7 (12.5%) were greater than 70 years of age. PTCA was successful in 61 (84%) vessels and 47 (84%) patients (greater than or equal to 1 vessel plus relief of angina). During index hospitalization, there were 2 deaths (3.6%), 4 myocardial infarctions (7.2%), 4 emergent bypass surgeries (7.2%) and 1 semiemergent bypass (1.8%) for technically unsuccessful PTCA. In follow-up from 3 to 36 months, there has been 1 additional myocardial infarction (1.8%), 1 late death (1.8%), 2 repeat PTCAs (3.6%), 6 crossovers to bypass (10.7%) and 38 patients (68%) have remained cardiac-event free. Although this angioplasty cohort is small and selected, these data raise the possibility that a prospective randomized comparison of PTCA versus bypass surgery might be feasible and appropriate in a subset of unstable angina patients who require intravenous nitroglycerin or IABP.\r"

Analyses were made within four to six days after the collection of the samples; storage conditions mimicked those of testing programs using liquid blood samples (as in Georgia) or dried blood filter paper samples (as in several other states). During analysis of hemoglobin solutions extracted from dried blood samples, considerable difficulties were encountered in detecting significant hemoglobinopathies such as SS and SC, whereas even simple abnormalities such as AS, AC, AD, and AE were also often not diagnosed. Detection of the fast-moving variant Hb Bart's or gamma 4 was not possible. These results again cause doubt regarding the general use of dried blood filter paper samples in newborn hemoglobin testing programs. Perhaps special precautions--such as speed in analyzing the samples, storage at -20 degrees C (or perhaps 4 degrees C) instead of at room temperature, and removal of unstable hemoglobin from the filter paper extract by centrifugation--might eliminate some of the problems that were observed.\r"

  ".W": "Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate both contain Factors I and VIII, however thawed FFP may be stored at 1-6 degrees C for 24 hours, but thawed cryoprecipitate may only be stored at 1-6 degrees C for six hours when used for Factor VIII content. To determine whether it would be safe and effective to extend the storage period of thawed cryoprecipitate from 6 to 24 hours, Factor VIII (and fibrinogen) levels were measured in 25 units of cryoprecipitates immediately on thawing and at 6 hours and 24 hours thereafter. The Factor VIII activity level decreased to 86% of the original activity level within 6 hours, but the drop between 6 and 24 hours was relatively small. Eighty percent of the original activity was still present at 24 hours after thawing. The fibrinogen level decreased to 87% of the original level within 6 hours but remained stable between 6 and 24 hours. Additional testing showed that fibrinogen levels remained stable between 6 and 74 hours. These data suggested that the storage of thawed cryoprecipitate might be extended to 24 hours when this blood product is used for Factor VIII content and to 74 hours when it is used for fibrinogen content. Furthermore, the lack of prohibition on the use of cryoprecipitate that has been thawed for more than six hours and stored at 4 degrees C for its fibrinogen content seems reasonable.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on thyrotropin (TSH) secretion was studied in vitro in male rats, using purified thyrotrophs isolated by centrifugal elutriation. The development of diabetes was associated with a significant fall in serum T4 (4.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.7 micrograms/dl, control vs. diabetic), T3 (59 +/- 16 vs. 20 +/- 9 ng/dl) and TSH (53 +/- 22 vs. 23 +/- 18 microU/ml). In vitro, basal TSH release was lower in cells from diabetic rats (1570 +/- 248 microU/10(6) cells) than in controls (2612 +/- 765 microU/10(6) cells) after 48 h in culture. Furthermore, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-induced TSH release was decreased about 30% and the intracellular TSH content was also reduced 45% in diabetic rat thyrotrophs compared with controls. The addition of 200 microU/ml of insulin in the incubation media did not change the TRH-stimulated TSH release, but it decreased the basal TSH release by 42%. Preincubation of thyrotrophs with glucose (25 mM) did not impair the basal or TRH-stimulated TSH release. In the same experimental conditions, no effect of insulin or glucose was seen on the basal or TRH-stimulated TSH release from thyrotrophs of diabetic rats. Preincubation of thyrotrophs with 10, 100, or 1000 nM of T4 for 48 h decreased basal TSH release by 27%, 45%, and 48%, respectively, and reduced TRH-induced TSH release by 46%, 48%, and 55%; 100 nM T4 also reduced TRH-induced TSH release from diabetic thyrotrophs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a putative hydroxyl radical scavenger, attenuates thromboxane generation and pulmonary hypertension in the piglet model of group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis. This study tested the hypothesis that DMTU reverses ongoing GBS-induced pulmonary hypertension coincident with decreased thromboxane production. Piglets (n = 15) received a 60 min infusion of GBS (10(-8) cfu/kg/min). Mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa), arterial blood gases (ABGs), and thromboxane B2 (TXB) levels were measured at 10 min intervals throughout the study. GBS infusion resulted in a marked increase in pulmonary artery pressure (mean delta Ppa = 31 mm Hg) and a significant decline in PaO2 (mean = -80 torr) within 10 min of beginning the infusion. pH decreased from a mean of 7.47 to 7.37. DMTU, 750 mg/kg, or normal saline vehicle was infused over 10-15 min beginning 10 min after initiating GBS. Ppa decreased significantly within 10 min of DMTU infusion. Piglets receiving vehicle had a slow decline in Ppa. Piglets receiving DMTU also had an improvement in PaO2 and showed no further drop in pH. Piglets receiving vehicle had no improvement in PaO2 and demonstrated a continued decline in pH. TXB levels did not differ between the groups at any time interval. We conclude that DMTU can partially reverse GBS-induced pulmonary hypertension, but may function through mechanisms independent of thromboxane generation.\r"

  ".W": "Macrovascular disease, especially coronary heart diseases, have been found to be linked to glucose intolerance. Insulin resistance in respect to glucose uptake in peripheral tissues seems to play an important role in the development of glucose intolerance, since subjects with coronary heart disease mainly are hyperinsulinemic. Insulin resistance may induce not only glucose intolerance but also hypertension, obesity, and dyslipoproteinemia (high very low-density lipoprotein and low high-density lipoprotein values), all variables that add to the risk of coronary heart disease. On the basis of these findings, a new syndrome has been postulated-syndrome X. This syndrome may be caused by inherited insulin resistance in skeletal muscles, and secondary to that arterial hypertension, obesity, and dyslipoproteinemia may develop. Insulin resistance in noninsulin-dependent diabetic persons and in hypertensive subjects is located in skeletal muscles, where insulin's ability to promote nonoxidative glucose metabolism is reduced. The key enzyme in this pathway, glycogen synthase, is proposed as the causal defect responsible for the insulin resistance state, at least in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients. The pill (sex steroids) may induce a clinical situation that is similar to syndrome X. However, it is important to emphasize that many more studies are needed to substantiate these hypothetical mechanisms behind coronary heart disease.\r"

Published studies of the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel are reviewed, and new information is presented regarding intra- and intersubject variation. Differences between various formulations of levonorgestrel are apparent when the formulations are compared in the same subjects. There is also a marked difference in the parameters when derived under single-dose or steady-state conditions. The role of sex hormone-binding globulin in the metabolism of levonorgestrel is questioned. Large intra- and inter-subject variations in the parameters exist, and a subject may show a large month-to-month variation when one levonorgestrel formulation is used and smaller variations when another formulation is used. This wide variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters, problems that arise in the derivation and interpretation of the parameters, the biologic significance of most of these parameters, and their lack of correlation with pharmacodynamic responses severely limit the usefulness of pharmacokinetic studies of the gestagens.\r"

The following preparations were studied: (1) monophasic desogestrel (150/30), (2) monophasic desogestrel (150/20, containing 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol instead of 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol, (3) biphasic desogestrel, (4) monophasic levonorgestrel (150/30), and (5) triphasic levonorgestrel. The effects of these preparations were assessed on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the ratio of apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B after 3 months of treatment, and the percentage changes with regard to pretreatment were calculated. The monophasic desogestrel (150/30) and biphasic desogestrel preparations induced higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels than did their levonorgestrel-containing counterparts. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in monophasic levonorgestrel and clearly decreased in the lowest ethinyl estradiol-containing monophasic desogestrel (150/20) and biphasic desogestrel preparations. Apolipoprotein B increased in all preparations. The antiatherogenic indexes (ratios of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I to apolipoprotein B were higher for monophasic desogestrel (150/30) and biphasic desogestrel than for comparable levonorgestrel-containing preparations. The differences seen between the desogestrel and levonorgestrel preparations can best be explained by the lower intrinsic androgenicity of 3-keto-desogestrel (active metabolite of desogestrel) than that of levonorgestrel.\r"

Serum concentrations of gestodene, levonorgestrel, ovarian and pituitary hormones, and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Thirty-five randomized into two groups receiving either of the preparations. Before treatment and in the third and sixth cycles, blood sample were drawn in the morning while subjects were still in bed to obtain basal conditions. The contraceptive effect and cycle control were good with both preparations, and there were only a few minor side effects. Sex hormone-binding globulin was elevated twofold in the levonorgestrel group and threefold in the gestodene group. The gestodene concentration in serum varied more than the levonorgestrel concentration, but with correction for variations in sex hormone-binding globulin binding, less variability in gestodene and levonorgestrel concentrations were seen. High-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol decreased in the levonorgestrel group but was unchanged in the gestodene group, whereas apolipoprotein A1 increased in the gestodene group but not in the levonorgestrel group. Antithrombin III decreased in the gestodene group but was unchanged in levonorgestrel-treated women. Factor VII increased in both groups but more in the gestodene group. We conclude that gestodene has a positive influence on lipid metabolism, probably because of its lower androgenicity, and a slightly negative influence on coagulation. The latter, however, probably has no clinical relevance.\r"

Thus a decrease in plasma tissue plasminogen activator concentrations, as is the case in oral contraceptive users, may result in a decrease in plasma fibrinolytic capacity despite a parallel decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor levels. It is now clear that the presence of specific intracellular receptors and a given motif in the genome are essential to mediate hormone-dependent regulation of gene expression. A computer search revealed potential estrogen and glucocorticoid-progesterone-responsive elements in the genes coding for tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and some other fibrinolytic variables. No convincing evidence for the presence of sex steroid receptors in endothelial cells was found, but liver cells clearly contain estrogen and androgen receptors. However, neither endothelial cells nor hepatocytes cultured in vitro showed a change in tissue plasminogen activator or plasminogen activator inhibitor synthesis on incubation with sex steroids (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) for 3 days. An alternative explanation for the observed decreases in tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor concentrations in the plasma of oral contraceptive users is discussed.\r"

The patterns observed were compared to those of vascularized whole-pancreas transplants with preserved and suppressed exocrine secretion. In addition the morphologic reactions after isogenic transplantation of islets or whole-pancreas transplants are described. The sequential patterns of acute rejection were found to be essentially identical in isolated islet and whole-pancreas allografts. This was also true for the process of I-A-like class II MHC antigen induction. Endocrine cell necrosis and reduced insulin content of beta cells were detected in isolated islets but not in whole-organ isografts. Thus ischemic damage may have occurred to be transplanted islets on days 1 and 2 because connections to the renal vasculature were not demonstrated before day 3. Islet cell loss was, however, functionally compensated by beta cell proliferation beginning on day 4. From the first day after transplantation, an altered spacial distribution of insulin- and glucagon-containing cells was present in islet isografts. This phenomenon was, however, not unique to islets, but also occurred in duct-ligated whole-organ isografts on days 6 to 10.\r"

There was no significant difference of the rate of periportal fibrosis in the 3 groups of intensity of infection. However, in the 204 patients who showed periportal fibrosis, there was a strong relation between severity of ultrasonographically detectable fibrosis with intensity of egg excretion. In 332 children, of which 73 had a heavy infection, no signs of periportal fibrosis were detected. Sudanese children show a variable susceptibility towards the development of S. mansoni-induced periportal fibrosis.

  ".W": "To determine the relative efficacy of metrifonate and praziquantel in controlling urinary tract morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium infection, a random allocation treatment trial was performed among 1,813 school age S. haematobium-infected children from the Msambweni area of Coast Province, Kenya. Following baseline examination for infection, hematuria, proteinuria, and ultrasonographic urinary tract abnormalities, oral treatment with either metrifonate (10 mg/kg, repeated at 4 month intervals) or praziquantel (1 dose of 40 mg/kg) was given to infected subjects. Prevalence of morbidity was reassessed 12 months later for each treatment group. Results indicated equivalent patient improvement in response to either regimen: prevalence of hematuria fell from 75% to 17% after either praziquantel or metrifonate therapy. Similarly, prevalence of proteinuria was significantly reduced from 73% to 29% (metrifonate) or 27% (praziquantel) after therapy. Metrifonate and praziquantel caused similar reductions in bladder granulomata and bladder thickening; however, no reduction in hydronephrosis was noted with either drug. Analysis of outcomes in population subgroups defined by age, sex, pretreatment intensity of infection, or severity of pretreatment morbidity showed no consistent advantage for either drug. In this endemic area, both agents provide effective control of morbidity due to urinary schistosomiasis.\r"

Clinical and laboratory findings among cases included fever, headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria. Ten individuals were hospitalized; 2 died. No subclinical infections were identified through a post-deployment screen of sera obtained from 2,053 exercise participants. Analysis of questionnaires identified no environmental, occupational, or temporal factors as risks for developing disease. However, 13 of the 14 cases occurred among individuals housed at 1 of the 2 base camps used during the exercise. This outbreak represents the largest cluster of HFRS cases among U.S. personnel in the Republic of Korea since the Korean conflict.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) has been used to detect accidental esophageal tube placement in noncardiac arrest situations. The purpose of our study was to determine whether ETCO2 measurement could distinguish tracheal from esophageal tube placement during closed-chest massage (CCM). Twelve large dogs were anesthetized, and endotracheal tubes were placed in both the trachea and the esophagus. Placement was verified by fiberoptic endoscopy. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by a 60-Hz discharge through a right ventricular pacemaker. After four minutes of cardiac arrest, CCM was initiated and continued for 20 minutes. The dogs were divided into two groups: Group A was ventilated through the tracheal tube, and group B was ventilated through the esophageal tube. Unused tubes were removed. ETCO2 was recorded continuously beginning two minutes before arrest until the end of the experiment. There were no significant between-group differences in mean arterial pressure, weight, blood loss, IV fluid volume administered, or prearrest arterial blood gases. ETCO2 differed significantly between the two groups throughout CCM (P = .001). In group A, ETCO2 ranged from 13 to 34 mm Hg (median, 20 mm Hg). In group B, ETCO2 ranged from 2 to 11 mm Hg (median, 3 mm Hg). In this experimental model, measurement of ETCO2 reliably distinguished esophageal from tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest and CCM. If confirmed in human beings, this may prove to be a quick, reliable method of detecting esophageal intubation during cardiac arrest.\r"

  ".W": "Improving patient outcomes while controlling the costs of care requires a partnership between clinical researchers and hospital management. To this end, Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, dedicated hospital operating funds to a program of small grants designed to align the patient care and academic interests of clinicians with the goals of efficient hospital management. The grants gave clinicians an opportunity to test the efficacy of specific patient care maneuvers. These studies resulted in improved guidelines for the use of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, new technology, and length of hospitalization. Annual marginal cost savings from implementing the first-year study results are projected to be $587,255, an 8 to 1 return on the first year's expenses. The authors conclude that a hospital-funded applied research program encourages those delivering patient care to identify inefficiencies and introduce change while ensuring quality patient care. This joint faculty-management effort can augment the hospital's quality-assurance, utilization management, and technology assessment programs while advancing the scholarship of faculty members.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of HIV-1 DNA sequences in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated in a two-stage polymerase chain reaction ('double' PCR) using four sets of nested primers. The PBMCs tested were obtained from 46 children born to HIV-seropositive mothers, seven 'control' children born to HIV-seronegative mothers and seropositive fathers, and 45 healthy adult blood donors who were HIV seronegative. Nine of the children had symptomatic HIV infection and other laboratory features characteristic of HIV infection: all nine were PCR-positive with each set of primers in each of their 22 blood samples tested. The remaining 44 children had no clinical or laboratory evidence of HIV infection, and each of their 50 samples was PCR-negative with each set of primers, as were all blood donor samples. PCR-positive samples were tested in more detail using two of the sets of primers, which spanned hypervariable regions in the env gene. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DNA amplified from these regions yielded patterns of amplified DNA length variation which were characteristic for each child, and which changed little with time (in serial samples obtained over periods of 3-7 months). This excluded contamination as a cause of PCR positivity. This is the first report of the use of a double PCR for the diagnosis of HIV infection. The results demonstrate the specificity of this PCR method in diagnosis, with failure to reveal in this cohort any cases of vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection in addition to those already confirmed by conventional laboratory techniques.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of cell-mediated immunity against the etiologic agent of human AIDS (HIV) in the non-human primate model of AIDS (simian immunodeficiency virus, SIV) has been difficult. In general, culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-1- and SIV-infected humans and monkeys, respectively, with purified inactivated HIV and SIV virus preparations has given inconsistent or negative proliferative responses. However, we describe herein an assay which consists of coculturing monocytes that have been pulsed with inactivated SIVsmm with nylon-wool-purified autologous T cells, leading to antigen-specific T-cell proliferation. The proliferative response, which predominantly occurs in CD4+ T cells, is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted and requires antigen processing. This assay will greatly facilitate the identification of the immunodominant epitopes recognized by T cells in sooty mangabeys, which are naturally infected but remain clinically asymptomatic, and in rhesus macaques, in which experimental infection leads to clinical symptomatology similar to human AIDS, eventually resulting in death.\r"

Colony formation in semi-solid medium by bone marrow progenitor cells (CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM) was significantly protected by dCyd against the cytotoxic effects of high doses of DDC. In contrast, in HIV-infected HUT-102 cells, anti-HIV effect of DDC (10 mumols/l) was preserved in the presence of 100 mumols/l dCyd but partially reversed by higher levels of dCyd. dCyd reduced the generation of DDC triphosphate (DDC-TP) relative to dCyd triphosphate (dCTP) pools to a significantly greater extent in BMMCs versus HUT-102 cells. This might explain dCyd-mediated abrogation of DDC cytotoxicity against marrow progenitor cells with relative preservation of its anti-HIV-1 activity in HUT-102 cells.\r"

Six months after operation, pelvic examination was normal in all the patients. However, ultrasonography with transvaginal probe demonstrated the presence of myomas of less than 1.5 cm in five women (63%) treated pre-operatively with the analogue and in two women (13%) who underwent immediate surgery (P less than 0.05). Induction of a period of hypo-oestrogenism before myomectomy seems to favour short-term recurrence of uterine myomas, limiting the efficacy of surgery.\r"

We report a pilot study of combined pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy (CHT/RT) in all patients with advanced vulval carcinoma presenting to St Bartholomew's Hospital between July 1987 and March 1989. Twelve patients have been treated, of whom nine had primary lesions (four FIGO stage III and five stage IV) and three had recurrent disease after simple or radical vulvectomy. Seven patients were treated with an initial split course of CHT/RT: there was one treatment-related death and the others have all died following recurrence with a median disease-free survival of 5 months (range 3-12) and a median survival of 7 months (range 3-16). Five patients have received a continuous course of CHT/RT: one died before operation with pulmonary metastases, three patients are disease free at 6 to 9 months, and another patient has been treated with only palliative intent. Toxicity was acceptable in the continuous regimen and this treatment seems to have a promising role in the management of advanced carcinoma of the vulva.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the safest, least costly, and most effective way to select patients with symptomatic carotid ischaemic events for carotid angiography before carotid endarterectomy. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--University departments of clinical neurosciences and clinical neurology. PATIENTS--485 Patients with carotid territory transient ischaemic attacks of the brain (n = 224) or eye (n = 162) or retinal infarction (n = 99) were referred to a single neurologist between 1976 and 1986. INTERVENTIONS--Clinical examination by auscultation over the precordium, supraclavicular fossae, and neck vessels (all patients). Cerebral angiography of patients suitable for carotid endarterectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Financial cost and number of disabling strokes after angiography. RESULTS--296 Patients were investigated by cerebral angiography. Ischaemic symptoms had occurred in the distribution of 298 internal carotid arteries (symptomatic) that were imaged, two patients having bilateral symptoms. The presence or absence of a carotid bruit and the maximum percentage diameter stenosis of the origin of the symptomatic internal carotid artery were correlated. The prevalence of mild disease (diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 25%) of the symptomatic internal carotid artery was 57%, and if an ipsilateral carotid bruit was heard the probability of mild stenosis rose to 92%. The prevalence of moderate disease of the symptomatic internal carotid artery (stenosis greater than or equal to 50%) was 39%, and if a bruit was heard the probability doubled to 78%. The prevalence of severe internal carotid disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 75%) was 22%, and if a bruit was heard the probability was more than double, at 49%. The direct cost to both the NHS and the private health sector of investigating patients with symptomatic carotid ischaemia was estimated for several strategies of carotid artery imaging and expressed in terms of financial cost and number of strokes after angiography incurred in detecting all patients with diameter stenosis of the symptomatic internal carotid artery of greater than or equal to 25%, 50%, or 75%. To detect diameter stenosis of the internal carotid artery of greater than or equal to 25% it is most cost effective to proceed directly to cerebral angiography in patients with a carotid bruit over the symptomatic carotid bifurcation and to screen patients without a carotid bruit by duplex carotid ultrasonography; patients in whom duplex ultrasonography discloses stenosis of greater than or equal to 25% are then referred for cerebral angiography. To detect only more severe internal carotid disease (stenosis of greater than or equal to 50%) the same policy applies, unless the local duplex ultrasonographic service is particularly efficient and reliable, when it is probably most cost effective and safer to screen all patients by this method irrespective of the findings on cervical auscultation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Mean P(a-ET)CO2 was 5.47 +/- 5.21 mmHg, with the mean PaCO2, 36.51 +/- 5.89 mmHg and mean ETCO2, 31.04 +/- 6.44 mmHg. For the population as a whole, the correlation between PaCO2 and ETCO2 determined by regression analysis was maintained (R = 0.644, P less than 0.001). Comparison of the individual and population correlation coefficients by Student's t test showed no significant difference, but a normal population distribution of the gradients (P less than 0.05). None of the variables assessed could be determined to influence P(a-ET)CO2 significantly. For many of the individual patients, however, the relationship between PaCO2 and ETCO2 did not maintain a significant correlation throughout the study period. In the postoperative cardiac surgery patient population P(a-ET)CO2 follows a normal distribution and PaCO2 and ETCO2 maintain a statistically significant correlation. However, when evaluating individual patients, this relationship has wide variability.\r"

Sixty-seven patients with rest angina and angiographic evidence of coronary stenosis were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (0.75 mg/kg over 1 hour), high-dose intravenous rt-PA (0.75 mg/kg over 1 hour; total dose, 100 mg over 6 hours), or intravenous placebo followed by repeat coronary angiography at 24-48 hours to assess change in the severity of coronary narrowing. Each patient also received oral aspirin and intravenous heparin. Mean values of coronary stenosis severity (percent of diameter reduction) declined to a similar extent in each group: placebo, 75 +/- 14% to 72 +/- 14% (p = 0.07); low-dose rt-PA, 75 +/- 16% to 71 +/- 18% (p = 0.03), and high-dose rt-PA, 82 +/- 11% to 77 +/- 17% (p = 0.18), with only the low-dose rt-PA group achieving statistical significance. Resolution of intracoronary filling defects, increase in antegrade flow grade, or both also occurred equally among the three groups. There was considerable variation in individual patient response. Between 29% and 50% of patients within each group demonstrated a decrease in stenosis severity, whereas 50% to 57% noted either improvement in antegrade flow or resolution of intracoronary thrombus. There was no difference in incidence of major bleeding events among the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the absence of demonstrable retrograde conduction in Mahaim fibers, we located the accessory pathway ventricular insertion site using the criteria of concordance between paced and spontaneous QRS morphologies during pace-mapping and earliest onset of local electrogram relative to surface preexcited QRS. At this site, a QS-like pattern of unfiltered unipolar electrograms with steep downstroke was recorded. The optimal site appeared radiologically at the right ventricular anterior wall or the adjacent septum, 2-4 cm from the tricuspid anulus. Three to six 160-J shocks were delivered at this site using an anterior chest wall plate as anode. After fulguration, conduction through the Mahaim tract was absent. A right bundle branch block persisted in two patients. All patients remained free of preexcited tachycardia during 12-16 months of follow-up. Postablation electrophysiological assessment showed no preexcitation in any patient. No reciprocating tachycardia was inducible, even during isoproterenol infusion. Atrioventricular nodal conduction parameters were unchanged from baseline study. Catheter ablation of Mahaim fibers is an effective alternative method for the treatment of tachycardias that include the accessory pathway in the circuit.\r"

  ".W": "Interest in the antithrombotic potential of diets enriched with fish oil-derived polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) prompted us to examine how these fatty acids, when taken preoperatively, affect hemostasis, plasma lipid levels, and production of prostacyclin (PGI2) by vascular tissues in atherosclerotic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Fifteen patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease received 3 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.3 g/day docosahexaenoic acid as capsules of purified fish oil for 28 days before surgery. Platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of ADP, collagen, and epinephrine decreased (p less than 0.05) and serum thromboxane B2 decreased 36% (p less than 0.01) from baseline values. Bleeding times increased 40% (p less than 0.01) from baseline. Serum triglycerides decreased 50% (p less than 0.05) without a change in total serum cholesterol. Spontaneous production of PGI2 measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), its stable hydrolytic product, by saphenous vein and aortic and atrial tissues obtained at surgery was greater in tissues from patients receiving omega-3 PUFA supplements than in tissues from matched controls (13.8 +/- 2.2 versus 8.6, 21.0 +/- 3.1 versus 11.5 +/- 2.1, and 166 +/- 13 versus 102 +/- 15 ng/g, respectively, all p less than 0.05). Arachidonate-stimulated production of PGI2, as indicated by increased levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, was increased. Despite changes in platelet function, bleeding time, and vascular PGI2, the perioperative blood loss was not increased in subjects receiving fish oil supplements. Thus, omega-3 PUFAs at moderate dosages may exert antithrombotic effects by increasing prostacyclin production by vessel walls as well as by direct inhibition of platelet activity.\r"

Recent advances in our understanding of the multiple components of the beta-adrenergic receptor complex and of the mechanisms by which these components interact with each other have led to insights beyond the mere evaluation of beta-receptors to account for adrenergic hyporesponsiveness in congestive heart failure. In addition to a reduction in beta-adrenergic receptors, the failing heart appears to show key abnormalities in the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that link the beta-receptor to its biochemical effector. A reduction in the stimulatory protein and in the extent to which the stimulatory protein is linked to the beta-receptor are demonstrable in peripheral circulating lymphocytes and in cardiac tissue. These abnormalities are at least partially reversible.\r"

  ".W": "The interactions of epidermal growth factor (EGF) with transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and FSH in the modulation of DNA synthesis and differentiated functions were examined in cultures of granulosa cells isolated from the ovaries of immature rats primed with diethylstilbestrol. EGF alone or in the presence of FSH had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation into the DNA of granulosa cells; however, EGF inhibited FSH plus TGF beta-induced DNA synthesis. In contrast, when FSH was omitted from the culture medium, EGF acted in concert with TGF beta, and TGF beta plus IGF-I, to promote DNA synthesis. EGF therefore has opposing actions on DNA synthesis; it inhibits or stimulates depending upon the presence or absence of FSH and consequently upon the endocrine environment in the follicle. As shown previously EGF alone had no effect on basal aromatase activity. EGF however inhibited FSH-induced and FSH plus IGF-I-induced aromatase activity. In this paper we show that EGF also inhibited the FSH-induced aromatase activity in the presence of TGF beta, which augmented FSH action on this system. The action of EGF on 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) was different from the effect of EGF on aromatase. In the absence of FSH, EGF induced 3 beta-HSD activity in the presence or absence of TGF beta. EGF augmented the action of FSH on 3 beta-HSD, and this interaction was further enhanced by TGF beta. These observations emphasize the multifunctional nature of EGF in influencing the growth and differentiation of immature rat granulosa cells. EGF can inhibit or stimulate growth and differentiated functions (aromatase and 3 beta-HSD), the response depending on the context of the signals that the cell receives from its endocrine and microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "Structure-function investigations were undertaken to increase understanding of the surface topology of the alpha-subunit of human FSH (hFSH). The objectives were to determine which sequences of the alpha-subunit of hFSH are surface-oriented (exposed to antibody) and to identify which of these surface-oriented sequences are in contact with the beta-subunit of hFSH in the alpha/beta heterodimer. Seven overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the primary structure of hFSH alpha were used for immunizing rabbits to generate site-specific antipeptide antisera. The antisera were characterized with respect to their reactivity to the seven synthetic peptides, as well as hFSH, hFSH alpha, hFSH beta, and hFSH alpha r/a (reduced and alkylated), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All of the peptides successfully generated antipeptide antisera with titers that range from 1:1,600 to 1:80,000. Anti-1-15 bound exclusively to hFSH alpha. Anti-11-27 and anti-33-58 bound to hFSH alpha to a much greater extent than to hFSH. In contrast, anti-73-92 had only slightly higher binding to hFSH alpha than to hFSH. Anti-22-39, anti-51-65, and anti-61-78 all failed to bind to either hFSH or hFSH alpha. With the exception of anti-22-39, all of the remaining antisera bound to hFSH alpha r/a. None of the antisera bound to hFSH beta. These data strongly suggest the following. Sequences 1-15, 11-27, and 33-58 contain residues that are masked by hFSH beta and are thus in or near the alpha/beta-subunit interface. In addition, sequences 11-27 and 33-58 contain other distinct residues that are surface-oriented in the hFSH heterodimer. In contrast, sequence 73-92 appears to be surface-oriented in the hFSH heterodimer. Lastly, sequences 51-65 and 61-78 appear to be buried within the native alpha-subunit and, thus, are unable to interact with antibodies. These results agree with and extend previous findings and will prove useful to those currently investigating the surface topology and structure-function relationships of the glycoprotein hormones.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-gamma (IFN) is produced by lymphocytes in areas of inflammation and connective tissue destruction. IFN inhibits collagen and DNA synthesis in cultured rat long bones and osteoblastic ROS 17/2.8 cells, suggesting that the periarticular loss of bone that occurs in inflammatory joint diseases may be due to IFN inhibition of bone formation. Since serum levels of bone gla protein (BGP) have been correlated with the bone formation rate, we studied the effect of IFN on production of this osteoblast-specific protein and steady state BGP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in ROS 17/2.8 cells. RIA of BGP was done using an antibody raised against rat BGP peptide. BGP synthesis was stimulated with 10(-8) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 24 h before and continuously after addition of recombinant rat IFN. IFN (100 U/ml) inhibited BGP secretion 52%, 78%, and 70% in the first, second, and third 24 h periods after IFN treatment, compared to control cells cultured with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 alone. The ED50 for IFN inhibition of BGP production was 3.3 U/ml (0.29 nM). Pulse labeling with [14C]leucine or [3H]proline during the last 4 h of culture revealed that IFN (3-100 U/ml) did not inhibit total protein secretion into the medium. The percent inhibition of BGP production by IFN was independent of media serum concentration or cell density. IFN (100 U/ml) decreased the steady state level of BGP mRNA as measured by Northern analysis using an oligomeric probe for rat BGP. The decrease in hybridization signal for BGP mRNA was detectable by 1 h after IFN exposure and continued to decline at 6 and 24 h. Treatment with cycloheximide (5 micrograms/ml) blocked the inhibitory effect of IFN on steady state levels of BGP mRNA. These results suggest that IFN may inhibit bone formation by selective inhibition of osteoblast matrix protein production. The mechanism of IFN inhibition of BGP production is, at least in part, pretranslational.\r"

Because TRH-induced PRL release is known to involve increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ derived from both extracellular and intracellular sources, the objective of the present study was to test whether sCT interferes with this effect. Secretogogue-induced elevations of cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in acutely dispersed AP cells were monitored using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Indo-1 AM and flow cytometry. AP cells were enzymatically dispersed to single cell suspensions and loaded with 20 microM Indo-1 AM for 30 min. Indo-1-loaded AP cells were scanned at a rate of approximately 500 cells/sec for 200-300 sec in a flow cytometer, and the ratio of fluorescence due to Ca2+ bound to Indo-1 to free Indo-1 (Indo-1 ratio), which is an index of [Ca2+]i, was determined for each cell. Under basal conditions, AP cells showed stable Indo-1 ratios during the scans, and 100% of the cells responded to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin with increases in the Indo-1 ratio. Approximately 25-30% of the AP cells responded to a 1 microM pulse of TRH with marked increases in the Indo-1 ratio, indicative of increases in [Ca2+]i, with the response consisting of two phases, an initial rapid rise that was unaffected by the presence of EGTA in the extracellular environment, followed by a decrease to a sustained secondary phase that was completely eliminated by EGTA. In a normal extracellular Ca2+ environment, pretreatment with 100 nM sCT almost totally inhibited the response to 1 microM TRH. In EGTA-pretreated AP cells, the initial EGTA-insensitive phase of the TRH-induced [Ca2+]i increase was also abolished by prior exposure to sCT. These results suggest that sCT inhibits TRH-stimulated PRL release in AP cells by attenuating the TRH-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, an effect that probably occurs as a consequence of inhibition of the stimulatory effect of TRH on the Ca2+/phospholipid messenger system.\r"

  ".W": "Salmon calcitonin (sCT)-like peptide is present in the central nervous system and pituitary gland of the rat, and this peptide inhibits basal and TRH-stimulated PRL release from cultured rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells. The present studies were designed to examine further the inhibitory actions of sCT on basal and TRH-stimulated PRL release and investigated 1) the temporal dynamics of the responses, 2) the effects of sCT on PRL release induced by other secretogogues, and particularly those acting via elevations of cytosolic Ca2+, and 3) the selectivity of sCT action on basal and stimulated AP hormone release. The inhibition of basal PRL release by sCT (0.1-10 nM) was dose-dependent and was characterized by a rapid onset with a gradual recovery to normal rates of release after the period of sCT inhibition. The inhibitory effect of sCT on basal PRL release was reversed by treatment with either the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). sCT infusion did not affect the basal release of GH, TSH, FSH, or LH by perifused AP cells. When administered in short pulses, TRH, at concentrations from 1-100 nM, elicited a dose-dependent increase in PRL release. When coadministered with short 10 nM TRH, sCT (1-100 nM) inhibited TRH-induced PRL release in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal inhibition of 78% at a concentration of 10 nM, and an ED50 concentration of approximately 3 nM. During longer (30 min) pulses of TRH (100 nM), PRL release increased sharply over 4-fold within 2 min, followed within 12 min by a rapid decline to a level 1.5-2-fold higher than basal, and this level was maintained for the remainder of the stimulation period. sCT pretreatment inhibited the overall PRL response to TRH. In contrast to its inhibition of TRH-induced PRL release, sCT failed to prevent the stimulation of PRL release by either ionophore A23187, PMA, vasoactive intestinal peptide, or forskolin. In addition, sCT failed to block TRH-induced TSH release or GnRH-induced LH release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Three experiments utilized bilateral endometrial perfusion devices for separate perifusion of myometrial and luminal surfaces to determine whether promoting calcium cycling across the luminal epithelial surface, which may be induced by interactive effects of estradiol and PRL, is involved in the reorientation of PGF secretion during establishment of pregnancy in pigs. In Exp 1, endometrium from cyclic gilts (n = 7) on day 14 after estrus was perifused with either saline (control) or calcium ionophore A23187 added to luminal surface perifusion buffer. In Exp 2, cyclic gilts (n = 7) at day 11 after estrus received an im injection of estradiol valerate (EV) after unilateral hysterectomy and the remaining EV-stimulated uterine horn removed at 6 h (n = 3) or 12 h (n = 4) after EV. Both surfaces of these endometrial samples were perifused with buffer containing either 250 ng/ml BSA or porcine PRL. In Exp 3, endometrium from cyclic (n = 3), pregnant (n = 4), and EV-induced pseudopregnant (n = 4) gilts was collected on day 14 after estrus and perifused with BSA or PRL to both surfaces. Orientation of PGF secretion was initially endocrine in Exps 1 and 2 (P less than 0.01). In Exp 1, calcium ionophore shifted the orientation of PG secretion from endocrine to exocrine (P less than 0.01). In Exp 2, neither EV in vivo nor PRL in vitro alone altered the orientation of PGF secretion. However, EV and PRL interacted to reorient secretion of PGF from endocrine to exocrine at 6 h (P less than 0.01) and 12 h (P less than 0.01) after EV. In Exp 3, the orientation of PGF secretion was endocrine in cyclic gilts and exocrine in pregnant and pseudopregnant gilts (status x side; P less than 0.05). PRL did not alter the orientation of PGF secretion regardless of reproductive status. These results suggest that the reorientation of endometrial PG secretion in pigs during the establishment of pregnancy involves interactive effects of estrogens and PRL, possibly through increased calcium cycling across the uterine epithelium.\r"

Human thyroid monolayer cells derived from both normal and abnormal human thyroid tissue showed low basal expression of the ICAM-1 antigen by flow cytometric assessment (mean % +/- SD positive cells = 13.7 +/- 6.1) compatible with the presence of ICAM-1 positive nonthyroid cells within the monolayer cultures. However, thyroid cell ICAM-1 antigen expression was further induced by exposure to recombinant human interferon-gamma (IF-gamma). At 100 U/ml, IF-gamma induced ICAM-1 expression in 56.0 +/- 19.0% of thyroid monolayer cells. Even greater expression of ICAM-1 antigen was induced by IF-gamma in human fetal thyroid cell monolayers of high purity (up to 80% of ICAM-1 positivity) thyroid monolayers established from a patient with Graves' disease (up to 84%), and in two immortalized human thyroid cell clones, 12S and TAD-2 (up to 61%). Furthermore, dose-response curves for ICAM-1 and HLA-DR antigen induction by increasing concentrations of IF-gamma showed that ICAM-1 antigen gene induction was 10-fold more responsive to IF-gamma than the HLA-DR antigen gene. In order to explore the functional consequence of ICAM-1 antigen expression by thyroid epithelial cells we examined the binding of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to thyroid monolayer cells and immortalized thyroid cells. These studies revealed a preferential adhesion of human PBMC to IF-gamma-treated thyroid monolayers compared to untreated control monolayer cells. Furthermore, this IF-gamma-induced cell adhesion was specifically inhibited by monoclonal anti-ICAM-1. These experiments demonstrate not only the capacity of human thyroid epithelial cells to express ICAM-1 antigen in the presence of a cytokine but, in addition, identify ICAM-1 antigen as responsible for enhanced T cell binding to thyroid epithelial cells. ICAM-1 antigen may, therefore, play an important role in T cell targeting and accumulation within the thyroid gland in autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to human (h) FSH were utilized to probe epitopes of the beta-subunit of hFSH (hFSH beta). These mabs had an average approximate affinity constant (Ka) of 10(8) M-1 for hFSH beta and 10(7) M-1 for heterodimeric hFSH. Hormone specificity of mabs for hFSH beta was demonstrated by a lack of cross-reactivity with hCG alpha, FSH alpha, or LH alpha. Epitope specificity of each mab was initially assessed by determining whether solid phase mab could bind to [125I]hFSH already bound to mabs in liquid phase. In addition, it was determined whether [125I]mab could bind to hFSH already bound to solid-phase mabs. Both epitope cross-matching protocols indicated that all mabs bound to the same epitopes on hFSH beta. Next, synthetic peptides corresponding to the sequence of hFSH beta were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to map this epitope. All mabs bound to peptides 7-19, 1-20, 33-53 and 66-85 but did not bind or bound weakly to peptides 81-100, 95-103, and 103-110. Titration experiments were performed using different concentrations of peptide (0.3-41 nmol) and one mab 3G3 (500 ng-25 ng) in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The product of the lowest mass of both peptide and antibody which gave a positive result was used to rank the peptides for their binding with mab 3G3. Peptides were ranked in the following descending order of potency: 33-53, 49-67, 66-85 much greater than 16-36, 1-20, 95-103, 52-65, 81-100, and 103-110. Ability of the mabs to inhibit binding of [125I]hFSH to bovine testis membrane receptor (Rec) was also studied. When [125I]hFSH was preincubated with increments of each mab for 2 h at 25 C before adding Rec with further incubation for 16 h, all mabs inhibited [125I]hFSH binding to Rec. The data suggest that most of the hFSH beta molecule has a conformation enabling all antibody recognizable regions to be in close proximity to each other. The present study provides evidence for an assembled epitope comprising in part, amino acids 33-53, which has been previously shown to be involved in receptor binding. Peptide sequences 49-67 and 66-85 are neighboring sequences in this assembled epitope which contains the determinants for receptor binding.\r"

  ".W": "PTH release from bovine parathyroid cells is inhibited by increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium (Ca2+). We have proposed that this inhibition is mediated by Ca2+ channels via a G-protein. To further test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of lanthanum (La3+), a potent Ca2+ channel antagonist that does not cross the cell membrane. PTH release was determined in dispersed bovine parathyroid cells by radioimmunoassay: extracellular Ca2+ concentration was 0.2 mM. PTH release was inhibited by maximal concentrations of La3+ to a greater extent than by Ca2+: 93% inhibition by La3+ vs. 40% by Ca2+. La3+ was more potent (set-point = 0.12 mM) than Ca2+ (set-point = 1.2 mM). Incubation of parathyroid cells with pertussis toxin, which inactivates a G-protein(s) and blocks inhibition by Ca2+, did not block the inhibition of PTH release by La3+ at the concentrations tested. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which potentiates the effect of Ca2+, did not enhance the inhibition of PTH release by La3+. Increasing concentrations of calcium enhanced the inhibition of PTH release by the Ca2+ channel agonist, (+)202-791. The Ca2+ channel antagonist, (-)202-791, shifted the Ca2+ inhibition curve to the right. La3+ did not alter the inhibition of PTH release by the Ca2+ channel agonist but blocked the stimulatory effect of the Ca2+ channel antagonist, (-)202-791. In summary: 1) La3+, which blocks Ca2+ channels and does not cross cell membranes, effects a greater inhibition of PTH release than Ca2+; 2) La3+, like Ca2+, overrides the effect of Ca2+ channel antagonist (-)202-791; and 3) La3+, unlike Ca2+, inhibits PTH release by a mechanism that is independent of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. There may be two cell surface sites that recognize La3+ and Ca2+ independently.\r"

  ".W": "The guinea pig is unusual in that its postnatal growth appears to be independent of GH even though its pituitary gland produces a GH molecule. The effects of fasting on the GH secretory pattern and the GH responses to insulin, GH-releasing factor (GRF), and somatostatin (SS) during fasting have now been studied by automatic microsampling of blood in chronically cannulated normal guinea pigs. Withdrawal of food in both male and female guinea pigs changed the GH secretory pattern dramatically. The normal episodic GH secretory pattern [large GH peaks occurring at 3.6 +/- 0.4-h intervals over a low (approximately 0.5-1.5 ng/ml) baseline secretion] was altered to a pattern of more continuous GH output, characterized by a 10-fold elevated baseline secretion (5-15 ng/ml) with no large secretory episodes or troughs. Glucose injections (three injections of 600 mg, iv, at hourly intervals) in fasted guinea pigs lowered their elevated blood GH levels significantly (from 9.1 +/- 1.1 to 6.5 +/- 0.9 ng/ml). Insulin injections (1, 2, or 6 U, iv) inhibited spontaneous GH pulses in normally fed animals, but had little effect on the high continuous GH tone during fasting. The elevated GH secretion in fasted animals could be inhibited by continuous infusion of SS or a single iv injection of a long-acting SS analog. The secretion of GH during fasting could be further increased, either by injections of GRF (two injections of 2 micrograms, iv, 90 min apart), producing peak levels of 102 +/- 16 and 68 +/- 21 ng/ml (above a baseline output of 8.8 +/- 2.2 ng/ml), or by a continuous iv infusion of GRF (12 micrograms/h). Because the GH secretory pattern in the guinea pig is so sensitive to nutrition and insulin, this species may provide an interesting model in which to study selectively the metabolic, as opposed to growth-promoting, actions and regulation of GH.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadectomy results in a rise in gonadotropin secretion and subunit gene expression, although the relative contributions of declining gonadal hormones or increasing hypothalamic GnRH secretion are uncertain. To further delineate the roles of the hypothalamus and gonads in regulation of gonadotropin gene expression, male and female rats were castrated and gonadotropin subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations measured 2, 7, 14, or 21 days (d) later. In males, FSH beta mRNA was maximal (2-fold increase) by 7 d while peak levels of alpha (3-fold) and LH beta (3-fold) were seen by 14 d. Testosterone (T) replacement restored all three subunit mRNA concentrations to intact values. In females, FSH beta mRNA also reached plateau levels (8-fold increase) earlier than alpha (3-fold) or LH beta (11-fold). When female rats ovariectomized 7 days earlier were given estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) implants for up to 14 d, suppression of alpha and LH beta to intact levels was observed. However, FSH beta mRNA concentrations only decreased to 67% of castrate values, and remained 2- to 3-fold higher than levels in intact female rats. Female rats were also given E2 replacement at the time of ovariectomy. LH beta mRNA was maintained at intact levels for 14 days while alpha and FSH beta showed partial castration responses (2-fold and 3-fold, respectively). Finally, to determine whether E2 and P regulate gonadotropin subunit expression directly or by reducing GnRH secretion, female rats were ovariectomized and immediately replaced with E2, P, or E2 + P in the presence or absence of a GnRH antagonist (A) for 2 d. alpha mRNA was increased (2-fold) by E2 but not by E2 + A suggesting that E2 requires the presence of GnRH to increase alpha mRNA. P alone was ineffective, but both E2 and A prevented the LH beta mRNA response to ovariectomy. The effects of E2 and A were not additive, suggesting that E suppresses LH beta mRNA by inhibiting the increase in GnRH secretion. In contrast, the FSH beta mRNA response to ovariectomy was only partially suppressed by E2, E2 + P, or E2 + P + A. These data indicate that in castrate males, replacement of T suppresses all three subunit mRNAs to intact levels. However, replacement of E2 to ovariectomized females did not prevent the increase in alpha and FSH beta mRNAs. In female rats, LH beta mRNA is predominantly regulated by GnRH. alpha mRNA expression is also mainly regulated by GnRH, and E2 appears to augment GnRH action on alpha mRNA expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cultured rat granulosa cells have provided a useful model to examine the hormonal regulation of inhibin secretion. In the present study we have used the cloned rat inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit cDNAs to characterize the influences of gonadotropins, growth factors, and GnRH on inhibin subunit mRNA levels in granulosa cells obtained from immature estrogen-treated rats. Cells were cultured in medium with or without added hormones. Total RNA from cultured cells was extracted and hybridized with 32P-labeled inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit cRNA or beta-actin cDNA probes, and inhibin subunit mRNA levels were normalized with beta-actin mRNA levels. Treatment of granulosa cells with FSH increased inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, LH, but not PRL, increased alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA levels in granulosa cells pretreated with FSH to induce functional LH and PRL receptors. The effects of FSH and LH on inhibin subunit mRNA levels were mimicked by forskolin, which increased alpha- and beta A-subunit transcripts in a dose- and time-dependent manner, suggesting involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A pathway. Since several growth factors have been shown to influence inhibin secretion, their effects on inhibin subunit mRNA levels were also studied. Treatment of cells with transforming growth factor-beta 1 increased both basal and FSH-stimulated inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA content, whereas insulin-like growth factor-I had no significant effect. In contrast, both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) markedly suppressed both basal and FSH-stimulated inhibin subunit transcript levels. The inhibitory effects of EGF and basic FGF were dose dependent and persisted from 12-72 h of incubation. The regulatory peptide GnRH, which decreases inhibin secretion, was also found to suppress FSH-stimulated inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effects of GnRH could be counteracted by coincubation with a GnRH antagonist, suggesting the involvement of specific GnRH-binding sites in GnRH action. These studies indicate that, except for insulin-like growth factor-I, the effects of gonadotropins, growth factors (EGF, basic FGF, and transforming growth factor-beta 1), and GnRH on inhibin secretion are related to their regulation of inhibin alpha- and beta A-subunit mRNA levels.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations of immune activity are often accompanied by reproductive disorders. Because interleukins mediate the host's response to immune activation, we first examined the effect of the central injection of several lymphokines on LH secretion by gonadectomized rats. We then studied the ability of the most potent lymphokine in this system, interleukin-1 beta (Il-1 beta), to interfere with the proestrous LH surge and ovulation in the intact female rat as well as the dependence of this effect on the activation of opiate receptors. Finally, we investigated the possibility that increased brain levels of Ils, as induced by the central administration of a bacterial endotoxin, might also alter the normal ovulatory process. After intracerebroventricular (icv) injection, Il-1 beta, Il-6, and tumor necrosis factor all lowered plasma LH levels in castrated rats. On a molar basis, Il-1 beta was the most potent inhibitor of LH secretion. In gonadectomized animals, 2.5 and 10 ng Il-1 beta administered icv significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) decreased plasma LH levels for 6 h, while the effect of 40 ng lasted up to 12 h. By contrast, FSH secretion was only measurably altered by 40 ng Il-1 beta 8 and 12 h posttreatment. In intact cycling female rats, icv injection of 40 ng Il-1 beta or 400 ng Il-1 alpha at 0830 h on the morning of proestrus significantly (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) interfered with the proestrous surge of LH. In contrast, the peripheral administration of either lymphokine was without measurable effect. Centrally injected Il-1 beta (40 ng at 0830 h on proestrus) also blocked ovulation in most animals, while a dose of 25 ng injected iv was ineffective. Finally, we observed that the icv injection of endotoxin (a lipopolysaccharide), also interfered with ovulation. The possible involvement of opiate-dependent pathways in mediating the inhibitory action of Il-1 beta on reproductive processes was tested by implanting naloxone pellets 16-24 h before lymphokine treatment. The pellets, which released 200, 400, or 800 micrograms naloxone/h (corresponding to approximately 0.6, 1.32, or 2.64 mg/kg BW.h), had no effect on ovulation by themselves. When given before icv Il-1 beta, all naloxone regimens countered the effect of the cytokine, with the 800-micrograms/h dose restoring ovulation in eight of nine rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Anterior pituitary fragments from male, proestrous female, or metestrous female rats were perifused for 8 h in either the absence (basal secretion rate) or presence of pulsatile GnRH administration (50 ng/ml peak concentration). Perifusions used medium containing 0.05% ethanol (vehicle), 600 ng/ml corticosterone, or 600 ng/ml cortisol. GnRH-stimulated secretion of FSH was enhanced in pituitaries from both male and female rats after in vitro incubation with either corticosterone or cortisol. The basal secretion rate of FSH was also elevated in proestrous females after glucocorticoid treatment. The GnRH-stimulated secretion rate for LH was significantly decreased in pituitaries from male rats treated with either glucocorticoid. In contrast, pituitaries from proestrous rats responded to either cortisol or corticosterone with an increase in LH secretion. Metestrous pituitaries showed divergent effects of the glucocorticoids on LH secretion; corticosterone enhanced secretion rates, and cortisol effected a decrease. Our data demonstrate that 1) glucocorticoids exert a direct effect on the secretion of LH and FSH from male and female rat pituitaries; 2) glucocorticoids elicit different effects on the secretion of LH and FSH, suggesting that they act at separate sites to regulate LH and FSH secretion; and 3) the effect of in vitro glucocorticoid treatment on gonadotropin secretion is dependent on sex and cycle stage of the pituitary donor and may be linked to prior in vivo concentrations of estrogen.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported that FSH stimulates flux of 45Ca2+ into cultured Sertoli cells from immature rats via voltage-sensitive and voltage-independent calcium channels. In the present study, we show that this effect of FSH does not require cholera toxin (CT)- or pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein or activation of adenylate cyclase (AC). Significant stimulation of 45Ca2+ influx was observed within 1 min, and maximal response (3.2-fold over basal levels) was achieved within 2 min after exposure to FSH. FSH-stimulated elevations in cellular cAMP paralleled increases in 45Ca2+ uptake, suggesting a possible coupling of AC activation to 45Ca2+ influx. (Bu)2cAMP, however, was not able to enhance 45Ca2+ uptake over basal levels at a final concentration of 1000 microM, although a concentration-related increase in androstenedione conversion to estradiol was evident. Exposure of Sertoli cells to CT (10 ng/ml) consistently stimulated basal levels of androstenedione conversion to estradiol but had no effect on basal levels of 45Ca2+ uptake. Similarly, CT had no effect on FSH-induced 45Ca2+ uptake, but potentiated FSH-stimulated estradiol synthesis. PT (10 ng/ml) augmented basal and FSH-stimulated estradiol secretion without affecting 45Ca2+ influx. The adenosine analog N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, which binds to Gi-coupled adenosine receptors on Sertoli cells, inhibited FSH-stimulated androgen conversion to estradiol in a dose-related (1-1000 nM) manner, but FSH-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx remained unchanged. Our results show that in contrast to FSH-stimulated estradiol synthesis, the flux of 45Ca2+ into Sertoli cells in response to FSH is not mediated either directly or indirectly by CT- or PT-sensitive G protein, nor does it require activation of AC. Our data further suggest that the FSH receptor itself may function as a calcium channel.\r"

The proliferative response in vitro of BBd unseparated SPCs or purified W3/13+ SPCs (i.e., T lymphocytes + large granular lymphocytes) to PMA + I far exceeded that of ConA, resulting in mean stimulation indices of 68 and 112 (PMA + I) and 1.9 and 30 (ConA). The incidence of AT was similar when equal numbers of unseparated SPCs from the same BBd donor were injected after activation by either PMA + I + interleukin 2 (PII) or ConA (57 vs. 50%, respectively); however, injection of PII-activated and macrophage-depleted W3/13+ SPCs from BBd animals resulted in a significantly higher incidence of AT (90%, P less than 0.05). As few as 0.5 x 10(6) PII-activated W3/13+ SPCs were sufficient to induce AT. Sixteen percent of recipients developed diabetes after injection of activated W3/13+ cells from 40-day-old BBdp donors. To determine which W3/13+ cells might mediate such transfer, purified and PII-preactivated CD4 T lymphocytes from BBd rats were injected, and they succeeded in AT in 44% of the recipients. Preactivated BBd B lymphocytes were unable to induce AT. Although a possible role for large granular lymphocytes cannot be excluded, the results demonstrate that in the BB rat, the beta-cell destruction can be induced by CD4 T lymphocytes.\r"

When cells growing 24 h on 27.5 mM glucose were changed to medium containing 5.5 mM glucose, sorbitol concentration returned to the control level within 12 h. The activity of aldose reductase was increased by a factor of 1.6 by exposure to elevated glucose concentrations, and the relative reactivity of the enzyme with glucose as substrate was approximately 0.1 compared with that of glyceraldehyde as substrate. Together, these results indicate that cultured cells derived from the HPT undergo activation of the polyol pathway when exposed to a hyperglycemic environment.\r"

To examine the influence of T-lymphocyte-receptor beta-genes on the development of beta-cell autoimmunity, (NOD x NZW)F1 x NOD backcrossed (BC) mice were studied for the development of insulitis, because insulitis is the pathognomonic histological lesion of autoimmune diabetes. Heterozygosity for H-2nod was permissive for the development of pancreatic interstitial inflammation and peri-islet insulitis, whereas homozygosity for H-2nod was highly associated with insulitis. However, (NOD x NZW)F1 x NOD BC mice developed insulitis regardless of homozygosity or heterozygosity for T-lymphocyte receptor beta nod. Therefore, in our study, T-lymphocyte receptor beta nod did not function as an autosomal-recessive beta-cell autoimmunity gene.\r"

Twelve patients received recombinant gamma-interferon, 2.5 to 10 million U daily, for 4 mo. All suffered from a dose-dependent, flulike syndrome similar to that induced by alpha-interferon. Recombinant gamma-interferon induced a marked increase of serum ALT and a significant decrease of serum hepatitis B virus-DNA. Serum hepatitis B virus-DNA disappeared in one patient during administration of recombinant gamma-interferon. Serum hepatitis B virus-DNA disappeared in four additional patients, and HBeAg disappeared in two patients during the 12 mo after administration of recombinant gamma-interferon. These results indicate that subcutaneous injection is suitable for administration of recombinant gamma-interferon and that recombinant gamma-interferon has an antiviral effect in patients with chronic active hepatitis B.\r"

Endotoxins are large-molecular-weight substances with an average molecular weight of 10(8). These large units can be divided into subunits down to a molecular weight of 10,000 which are thought to pass through dialyzer membranes. To investigate this, endotoxin antibody levels were measured in two groups of patients on chronic regular hemodialysis, a low-flux group using cellulosic membrane dialyzers (cuprophan and cuproammonium rayon (CAR) and a high-flux group using synthetic polymer membrane dialyzers (PMMA, EVAL). Using an ELISA based on standard endotoxin antibodies the percentages of patients in the low flux group with endotoxin antibodies were 26.9% with Cuprophan and 25% with CAR, not significantly different from a normal control group. In the PMMA and EVAL groups, it was 53.6% and 68.4% respectively. Back filtration of dialysate into blood is understood as the main reason for the entry of endotoxin in patients treated with high-flux dialyzers.\r"

We conclude (a) iron removal during dialysis with DFO was not demonstrated; (b) the dialysate concentrate tested contained large amounts of iron; (c) in view of potentially significant toxicity, and lack of demonstrable therapeutic benefit, caution in prescribing DFO chelation therapy for iron overload is recommended.\r"

Intravenous streptokinase was given to 315 patients and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to 141 patients. Reinfarction rate and risk factors for reinfarction were assessed. Management after thrombolysis was conservative; revascularization procedures were reserved for patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapy or for those with left main coronary artery stenosis. Coronary artery surgery or angioplasty was performed in only 3.7% of patients during the first 30 days after thrombolysis and in only 8.6% by 1 year. Most patients (79%) underwent coronary arteriography. Twenty-six patients (5.7%) exhibited signs of threatened reinfarction at 1 month after thrombolytic therapy as did 43 patients (9.4%) by 1 year. Reinfarction was prevented in four of these patients by early readministration of thrombolytic therapy. Multivariate analysis of possible risk factors for reinfarction identified at the time of initial infarction showed current cigarette smoking to be the only predictive factor (reinfarction occurred in 12.5% of smokers versus 6.3% of nonsmokers, p = 0.04). A second analysis of risk factors identified 3 weeks after initial infarction, including the severity of residual stenosis at coronary arteriography and exercise test variables, again showed continued cigarette smoking to be the only factor predictive of reinfarction. Twenty percent of patients who continued to smoke developed reinfarction compared with 5.1% of those who stopped (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined vasomotor responses to incremental blood flow induced by papaverine in the epicardial arteries of 10 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 14 patients with arterial irregularities (group 2) using quantitative angiography and Doppler ultrasound flow velocity measurements. An increase in coronary blood flow of 384.3 +/- 32.8% (p less than 0.001) in group 1 patients was associated with dilation of the proximal coronary artery segment and a 23.2 +/- 4.6% increase in cross-sectional area (p less than 0.001).

The time course of the lysis of a radioactive jugular vein thrombus was monitored continuously with an external gamma counter in anesthetized rabbits. Recombinant t-PA (0.25 mg) was given intravenously as a bolus injection (10% of the dose), followed by a 4 h infusion (90% of the dose). Rabbits received aprotinin 20 min after the start of the infusion as an intravenous bolus injection at a dose of 60,000 IU/kg (n = 4) or 20,000 IU/kg (n = 4). The rate of lysis in the different groups was compared 2, 60 and 180 min after aprotinin administration. Both doses of aprotinin immediately stopped thrombolysis. Thrombolysis was still blocked at 180 min with the highest dose but not with the lowest dose. Moreover, aprotinin could prevent the increase in bleeding time secondary to the injection of rt-PA. These results suggest that aprotinin might be used in vivo as an antidote for rt-PA.\r"

The Id differ both by their ability to stimulate proliferation of anti-Id T cells and their recognition by anti-Id-specific sera. Also, mice infected with S. mansoni develop anti-Id T and B cell responses against mouse anti-SEA antibodies. We now show that anti-SEA antibodies from serum pools of chronic, but asymptomatic patients (AM1 and AM5) stimulate proliferation of spleen cells from mice infected with S. mansoni. However, AM8, anti-SEA antibodies from hepatosplenic patients, did not stimulate these spleen cells. The murine responses directly parallel patient studies where AM1 and AM5 Id-stimulated human PBMC, but AM8 Id did not. In competitive ELISA, using AM1 or AM-5-specific rabbit antisera or human anti-SEA mAb E5-specific rabbit antiserum, sera from mice infected for 8 and 16 wk (but not from uninfected mice) compete with AM1, AM5, or E5. These sera do not compete in the AM8/anti-AM8 competitive ELISA. Sera from 8-wk-infected mice inhibit more against AM1, AM5, and E5 than do sera from later infections, and anti-SEA immunoaffinity-purified antibodies from 8-wk-infected mice stimulate spleen cells from infected mice more than anti-SEA antibodies from sera of mice late in infection. However, spleen cells from more chronically infected mice are more responsive to either the murine or human anti-SEA antibody preparations than cells from mice with earlier infections. Both the ELISA data and lymphocyte responses indicate that anti-SEA antibodies from mice infected with S. mansoni for 8 wk bear Id cross-reactive with those expressed on anti-SEA antibodies from humans with chronic, asymptomatic schistosomiasis, but not those from hepatosplenic patients.\r"

Cells in S-phase were labeled with 125I-UdR or 3H-TdR in vitro and transfused i.v. Identical proportions of both helper cell subsets localized in the small intestine but three to four times as many OX22- cells as OX22+ cells migrated to the intestinal epithelium. Experiments using MHC class I and II recombinant rats indicated that localization of OX8- OX22- cells in the lower lamina propria (LP) and muscularis was reduced by 50% in MHC class II incompatible rats as assessed by total gamma-counts but by a factor of three when labeled cells were counted. Movement of labeled OX8- OX22- cells to the epithelium was reduced by a factor of five to seven when assessed by the same methods. Quantitative cellular localization in the gut and further movement to the epithelium were normal in class I-mismatched rats. The movement from the lower-mid LP to the epithelium was undertaken principally by dividing cells as indicated by a progressive loss of grain counts in labeled cells and the appearance of doublet-cells in mitosis. In allogeneic combinations, extravasating cells remained localized close to their primary site of exit in the muscularis and lower-mid LP. The results suggest that the requirement for MHC class II compatibility for adoptive transfer of immunity in rats to T. spiralis is functionally related to localization of the protective OX22- cell subset in the epithelium.\r"

The determinant recognized by mAb 4-10 appears on resting T cells of all individuals tested (n greater than 30). Unlike previously described anti-class I mAb, 4-10 was shown to be directly mitogenic for T cells obtained from more than 20 normal donors. In order for 4-10 to exert its mitogenic effect on purified T cell populations it must be immobilized on a solid support. Immobilization of 4-10 can be circumvented if low numbers of adherent cells are added to the T cell cultures. mAb 4-10 preferentially activates the CD8+ T cell subset as judged by the fact that CD8+ T cells preferentially down-regulated their TCR after 4-10 activation and because CD4+ T cell activation with 4-10 requires approximately five times the concentration of mAb needed to reach comparable levels of activation observed with CD8+ T cells. We further observed that simultaneous cross-linking of class I and CD8 Ag by using 4-10 and anti-CD8 mAb almost completely abrogated the proliferative response of T cells when anti-CD8 was presented in immobilized form. In contrast, similar cross-linking with 4-10 and anti-CD4 diminished the response by about 20%. We also found that other anti-class I mAb were able to synergize in the activation of T cells with mAb 4-10 in a dose-dependent manner.\r"

BW5147 transfectants were obtained that stably expressed CD8 and this expression was maintained after somatic cell hybridization with activated T lymphocytes. To determine whether the stable expression of CD8 would facilitate the generation of class I MHC-specific T-T hybridomas, the transfected cells were fused with alloreactive T cells and the resultant hybrids were screened for their ability to produce lymphokines in response to antigenic stimulation. Somatic cell hybridizations with BW5147-CD8 transfectants give rise to a much higher frequency of class I MHC-specific T-T hybridomas relative to parallel fusions with BW5147. To determine whether the BW5147-CD8 transfectants would also support the generation of Ag-specific, class I MHC-restricted T-T hybridomas, they were fused with OVA-specific CTL. Several T-T hybrid clones were identified that produced lymphokines after stimulation with a transfected APC that was synthesizing OVA, or with a tryptic digest of OVA in the presence of syngeneic APC. The stimulation by Ag was MHC-restricted and mapped to the Kb molecule. An anti-CD8 mAb inhibited the stimulation of these hybridomas by Ag plus APC, whereas their stimulation by mitogen was unaffected. Cytolytic activity was not detected when several of the OVA-specific or alloreactive hybridomas were tested for their ability to kill target cells bearing the appropriate Ag. These results demonstrate that the BW5147-CD8 transfectants allow the generation of class I MHC-restricted T-T hybridomas. The potential utility of this system is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophages cultured with IL-2 and IFN-gamma before exposure to microorganisms developed the ability to resist infection with the obligate intracellular parasite, Leishmania major. The induction of this macrophage effector response was maximal by 6 to 8 h after lymphokine addition, and was independent of lymphokine treatment sequence. Activation of macrophages for resistance to infection was the result of the direct action of IL-2 and IFN-gamma on macrophages: the effector reaction was demonstrated in both resident peritoneal macrophages depleted of T cells and bone marrow-derived cells, a homogeneous macrophage population. Radiolabeled murine rIFN-gamma, human rIL-2, and mAb to the IL-2R (7D4), each bound to murine bone marrow-derived macrophages in a specific and saturable manner, which suggested that unstimulated macrophages have receptors for both lymphokines. Treatment of macrophages with IFN-gamma increased the specific binding of IL-2; treatment of cells with IL-2, however, did not up-regulate the IFN-gamma-R. Addition of protein or RNA synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide, emetine, actinomycin D) during exposure to rIL-2 and rIFN-gamma totally abrogated the ability of macrophages to express this effector reaction; inhibitors of protein kinase C, PG, or calcium redistribution had no effect. Soluble polyclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in culture fluids after activation of macrophages with IL-2 and IFN-gamma totally abrogated the expression of resistance to infection. The T cell growth hormone IL-2 acts as cofactor with IFN-gamma for induction of a macrophage antimicrobial activity, and TNF-alpha may be the effector molecule for resistance to infection regulated by these two lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of murine rTNF-alpha on c-fos and TNF mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis was investigated in bone marrow-derived macrophages to examine the mechanism(s) by which TNF modulates macrophage activity. A rapid and transient expression of the c-fos gene was induced by murine rTNF. This was blocked by 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, suggesting that the murine rTNF stimulated a protein kinase C-dependent signal transduction pathway. Although LPS induced the accumulation of one TNF mRNA species, murine rTNF induced the synthesis of two distinct TNF mRNA species. Both LPS- and murine rTNF-induced TNF mRNA accumulation was equally enhanced by pretreatment with mouse rIFN-gamma. In contrast, cycloheximide pretreatment had little effect on murine rTNF-induced TNF mRNA accumulation, whereas this treatment increased LPS-induced TNF mRNA by sevenfold. These results argue that TNF mRNA accumulation can be modulated in macrophages by distinct mechanisms. As assessed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis, LPS stimulated the synthesis of both cell-associated and secreted forms of TNF protein. In comparison, newly synthesized TNF protein was not detected when macrophages were treated with murine rTNF alone or in combination with murine rIFN-gamma. This demonstrates that although murine rTNF stimulated the synthesis of two distinct TNF mRNA species, additional signal(s) are necessary for their translation into protein and that such signals are present after LPS stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "90324600\r", 
  ".W": "IL-4 is a T cell-derived cytokine that regulates the induction of proliferation of resting B cells, and appears to act on various other cells involved in the immune response. The pluripotential effects of IL-4 are dependent on the interaction of IL-4 with its receptor (IL-4R). Although the regulation and metabolism of these receptors have been examined on B and T cells, little is known about the metabolism or regulation of the IL-4R on macrophages. In studying the dynamics of IL-4R expression on the murine macrophage-like cell line J774.16, we detected the presence of low numbers of high affinity IL-4R (234 +/- 38, Kd = 110 +/- 11 pM) on the surface membrane. However, upon exposure to IFN-gamma, a potent macrophage activating cytokine, there was a rapid upregulation (within 45 min) of IL-4R (2750 +/- 178) on the cell surface, with no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 205 +/- 37 pM). Maximum expression occurred at 2 to 4 h with no further increase in IL-4R expression over the next 48 h. Cells pulsed with IFN-gamma for 45 min displayed maximum IL-4R expression by 4 h. The induction of IL-4R by IFN-gamma was dose dependent: as little as 0.5 ng/ml of IFN-gamma was capable of inducing IL-4R expression, with optimal induction at 10 ng/ml. The addition of the metabolic inhibitors actinomycin D and cycloheximide before the addition of IFN-gamma indicated that both RNA transcription and protein translation were required for this upregulation to occur.\r"

  ".U": "90324602\r", 
  ".W": "Alteration in the surface membrane of endothelial cells (EC) is a feature of endothelial activation both at sites of inflammation in vivo and after stimulation with cytokines in vitro. The effects of stimulating EC with IL-1 or TNF include enhanced adhesiveness for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and T cells, the induction of EC leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) expression, and the increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the 1.4C3 Ag. In contrast, IFN-gamma stimulation increases EC binding of T cells but not PMN and enhances ICAM-1 expression but not ELAM-1 or 1.4C3 Ag expression. Recently we have reported that the T cell-derived cytokine IL-4 also increases EC adhesiveness for T cells but not PMN. In this study we have examined the effect of IL-4 on the expression of several cytokine-inducible EC activation Ag, by using a previously described ELISA technique. IL-4 modulation of activation Ag expression was concentration dependent, optimal at around 100 U/ml, and exhibited a unique pattern compared to that seen with the other cytokines. Although, IL-4 stimulation increased 1.4C3 Ag expression (p less than 0.001), it significantly inhibited constitutive ICAM-1 expression (p less than 0.01) and did not induce ELAM-1. Furthermore, IL-4 exhibited significant synergy with IL-1 or TNF in inducing 1.4C3 Ag expression (p less than 0.001) but inhibited the increased expression of ICAM-1 produced by IL-1, TNF, or IFN-gamma (p less than 0.01) and inhibited the induction of ELAM-1 by IL-1 and TNF (p less than 0.001). In contrast, IL-4 had no effect on the expression of EC HLA-class I, -DR, -DP, or -DQ and neither enhanced nor inhibited the effect of IFN-gamma on the expression of these molecules. Finally, although IL-4 alone caused little if any shape change in EC monolayers, it strongly synergized with TNF or IFN-gamma in causing a change in shape to a more fibroblastic morphology. These observations indicate that IL-4 increases EC adhesiveness for T cells by the induction of a different adhesion molecule to ICAM-1. Furthermore, the ability of IL-4 to both enhance and inhibit the expression of activation Ag on EC already activated by IL-1, TNF, or IFN-gamma suggests that it may be important in altering the quality of inflammatory responses such as may occur during the development and maintenance of chronic or immune-mediated inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against recombinant mouse lambda 5 protein, we determined that the pre-B cell specific mouse lambda 5 gene encodes a 22-kDa protein. The lambda 5 protein, which is related to conventional Ig lambda L chain proteins forms a complex with Ig mu H chain protein and an as yet unidentified 16-kDa protein (p16) in mu+ pre-B cell lines carrying a functionally rearranged VH-DH-JH allele. In pre-B cell lines which carry DH-JH rearrangements and do not express mu H chain protein, lambda 5 protein is associated with p16. Thus the expression of lambda 5 protein precedes the expression of intact mu H chain protein. This suggests the existence of developmentally regulated protein complexes involving the Ig L chain-like protein lambda 5 and p16 in mu- pre-B cells; lambda 5, p16, and Ig H chain protein in mu+ pre-B cells and Ig H chain and conventional Ig L chain proteins in B cells and plasma cells.\r"

For each determinant, sequence analysis of anti-streptococcal group A carbohydrate antibody V domains yielded small numbers of amino acids invariably associated with Id expression. Flow micro-fluorimetry was used to isolate three IdI-1- spontaneous mutants of the IdI-1+ hybridoma GAC 39; all had single amino acid changes in the L chain at position 60 and 77, all retained other Id, and all bound group A carbohydrate. Computer modeling was used to examine spatial relationships between Id. A number of the conserved Id5 and IdX residues cluster in the L chain framework region 1 around the first back loop connecting strands of the beta pleated sheets, and overlap at residue 15 (Id5, proline; IdX, leucine). This overlap accords with the mutually exclusive expression of Id5 and IdX. The IdI-1 loss variants have mutations of residues 60 or 77 on adjacent back loops, approximately 7.5 and 14 A from residue 15. Competitive inhibition of anti-IdX and anti-IdI-1 binding to antibodies expressing both Id can be attributed to steric hindrance. The framework back loops may be favored sites for cross-reactive Id expressed by products of a single V region gene. IdI-3a, an individual Id not associated with use of a particular gene segment, has been localized in part to residue 31 (hypervariable region 1) of the H chain.\r"

Raising the concentration of IFN-gamma did not diminish the potency of the inhibitors (50% inhibition by approximately 7 nM MDF, 2 pM TGF-beta 1, 4 pM TGF-beta 2, and 8 pM TGF-beta 3). These inhibitors partially blocked induction of nitrite release in macrophages activated with the combination of IFN-gamma plus TNF-alpha, but were incapable of inhibiting when macrophages were activated by the combination of IFN-gamma plus LPS. MDF and TGF-beta 1, -beta 2, and -beta 3 inhibited IFN-gamma-induced nitrite release only if present during the induction phase; once IFN-gamma-nitrite release had commenced, addition of the same cytokines was no longer inhibitory. Maximum inhibition of synthesis over a 48-h period required that the inhibitors be present during the first 3 h of induction. Thus, cytokines can suppress as well as induce macrophage synthesis of reactive nitrogen intermediates, products with cytotoxic, antimicrobial, and vasodilatory properties.\r"

This process is stimulated by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues and may involve a pertussis toxin insensitive GTP-binding protein. Our studies were designed to characterize the putative GTP-binding protein, localizing it to either membrane or cytosolic fraction in this system. Exposure of the isolated membrane fraction to guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), with or without arachidonate, had no effect on subsequent NADPH oxidase activation by the cytosolic fraction. Preexposure of the cytosolic fraction to GTP gamma S alone did not enhance activation of the membrane oxidase. However, preexposure of the cytosol to GTP gamma S then arachidonate caused a four-fold enhancement of its ability to activate the membrane oxidase. This enhancement was evident after removal of unbound GTP gamma S and arachidonate, and was not augmented by additional GTP gamma S during membrane activation. A reconstitution assay was developed for cytosolic component(s) responsible for the GTP gamma S effect. Cytosol preincubated with GTP gamma 35S then arachidonate was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography. A single peak of protein-bound GTP gamma 35S was recovered that had reconstitutive activity. Cytosol preincubated with GTP gamma 35S alone was similarly fractionated and the same peak of protein-bound GTP gamma 35S was observed. However, this peak had no reconstitutive activity. We conclude that the GTP-binding protein regulating this cellfree system is located in the cytosolic fraction. The GTP gamma S-liganded form of this protein may be activated or stabilized by arachidonate.\r"

The effect was directly related to the amount and concentration of drug in the initial exposure medium proportional to the bacterial density. Binding was nonsaturable at the highest drug:bacteria ratio tested. Elution, exposure of spheroplasts, and inhibition by divalent cations indicated binding sites in the outer bacterial membrane. Different bacterial species had variable efficiency but similar patterns of binding different aminoglycosides reflecting in vitro susceptibility. The self-promoted postexposure internalization of ionically bound aminoglycoside accounts for the early drug-concentration-dependent rapid bactericidal action of aminoglycosides. The phenomenon has implications for effective initial dosing with aminoglycoside antibiotics.\r"

Development of drug refractoriness required an adaptive period of growth, was enhanced by the continued presence of drug, and reversed after several hours of growth in drug-free medium. Unstable resistance was not explained by selection of mutants. The mechanism of adaptive resistance was down-regulation of aminoglycoside uptake during the period of accelerated energy dependent drug transport (EDP II). Down-regulation induced by gentamicin or tobramycin produced cross-resistance to other aminoglycosides. The kinetics of unstable first-exposure resistance suggests that a continuous drug level might not provide the most effective therapy with aminoglycosides and gives rationale to larger initial and longer interval bolus dosing.\r"

The 6B4 epitope is a Gal beta 1-4-GlcNAc residue, which is immunochemically similar to the precursor of the human erythrocyte i antigen. This epitope was found unmodified on gonococcal LOS in urethral secretions from two patients. The unmodified epitope could not be demonstrated on organisms in five secretions. Neuraminidase digestion exposed the 6B4 epitope on organisms in these secretions and increased the 6B4 epitope density in the two secretions, which contained the unmodified epitope.

The authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing ursodiol with elective cholecystectomy and expectant management for men and women of ages 50 and 70 with typical chronic biliary symptoms. DESIGN: Using published literature and national cost data, the authors performed a decision analysis in which the outcome measures were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and expected lifetime treatment cost. PATIENTS: The analysis applies to patients with symptoms of biliary colic, noncalcified gallstones less than 20 mm in diameter, and functioning oral cholecystograms, who are candidates for elective cholecystectomy. Excluded were patients with acute cholecystitis or known or suspected common bile duct stones. RESULTS: Ursodiol is both clinically advantageous and less expensive than surgery for symptomatic men aged 64 or more, and for symptomatic women aged 69 or more. At ages younger than these, the clinical advantage of surgery is small and could be nullified if ursodiol were targeted at patients for whom dissolution is most likely to be effective, based on evidence of stone size and composition. Expected lifetime costs of ursodiol range from $300-400 more than surgery for 50-year-olds to $700-1,000 less than surgery for 70-year-olds. Ursodiol is the preferred choice for patients throughout this age range who are at significantly elevated risk of operative mortality. CONCLUSION: Ursodiol is a clinically advantageous and cost-effective alternative to elective cholecystectomy, especially for older and high-risk patients.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study in two phases: 1) to develop a diagnostic index based on independent predictors of cervical infection; 2) to test the index. SETTINGS: A hospital-based clinic and a student health service. PATIENTS: Development phase: 190 nonpregnant women seen in the gynecology clinic; testing phase: 588 women seen in the gynecology clinic (n = 372) or the student health service (n = 216). INTERVENTIONS: Experienced clinicians recorded historical, physical, and microscopic findings on standard forms and tested women for chlamydial and gonococcal infections. RESULTS: Three independent predictors of cervical infection were identified and weighted: age (two points if less than 20 years and one point if 20-29 years); a new sex partner or one suspected of having a genital infection (one point); purulent vaginal discharge (one point). In the testing groups, cervical infection was present in none of 62 women with no points, seven of 269 (3%) with one point, 14 of 188 (7%) with two points, and 19 of 69 (28%) with three or four points (p less than 0.001). The index estimated the probability of infection more accurately (p less than 0.01) than did clinicians, performed well in each site, and remained accurate when C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae were considered separately. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic index accurately estimates the probability of cervical infection with either C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae and may be useful in selecting women for definitive diagnostic testing.\r"

  ".U": "90325015\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To reduce testing among hospitalized patients using practice guidelines for any of 14 medical problems. DESIGN: Comparison of test use before and after implementation of guidelines. The guidelines were developed by consensus panels of self-selected participating physicians. Non-participating physicians were monitored during the same periods. In addition, the two groups of physicians were evaluated similarly for their management of three medical problems for which guidelines were not developed. SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: 1,638 hospitalized patients and their 79 physicians. INTERVENTION: Implementation of practice guidelines for the care of hospitalized patients. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Geometric mean charges expressed in inflation-adjusted dollars were used as measures of test use. For the intervention group, laboratory tests decreased by 20.6%, x-rays by 42.3%, and EKGs by 34.2%. All the decreases were significant (p = 0.001). The non-participating physicians who were higher test users during both years of the study also achieved significant (p less than 0.05) but smaller reductions during the intervention year: 13.9% for laboratory tests, 30.3% for x-rays, and 21.8% for EKGs, perhaps because the same residents were involved in the care of both groups of patients. For the non-guideline diagnoses, the participating physicians achieved reductions of 11.1% for laboratory tests and 19.2% for x-rays, and a 3.5% increase in EKGs. Two-way analyses of variance that took into account the reductions in testing achieved by non-participants, or by participants with non-guideline diagnoses, revealed no significant reduction in testing attributable directly to the guidelines except for EKGs. Follow up of the participating physicians during the six months after the end of the intervention revealed that testing remained at the lower level achieved while the guidelines were in use. Outcome of care, as measured by deaths in the hospital, deaths within 90 days of discharge, and readmissions within 90 days of discharge, was not affected by the use of the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: 1) A large group of physicians could be recruited in a hospital to establish practice guidelines by group consensus. 2) These self-selected physicians were willing to use the guidelines (or allow the housestaff to use them) while caring for their patients. 3) Participating physicians were able to achieve substantial and significant reductions in testing without any demonstrable adverse effect on quality of care as measured by deaths and readmissions, and without any demonstrable shifting of resources from the inpatient to the outpatient setting of care. 4) The reductions in testing, whether caused by the guidelines or not, persisted for at least six months beyond the end of the period of implementation.\r"

  ".W": "The observation that mammary cancer induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) in young, virgin, Sprague-Dawley rats is abolished by pregnancy led us to test the possibility of protecting the mammary gland from chemically induced carcinogenesis by using the placental hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Fifty-day-old, outbred, virgin, Sprague-Dawley rats were utilized in two different experimental protocols. In protocol 1, four groups of virgin rats received either no hCG (group I) or a daily intraperitoneal injection of hCG at 1 IU (group II), 10 IU (group III), or 100 IU (group IV) for 21 days; group I and groups II-IV, at 21 days after the last injection, were given a single intragastric dose of 8 mg of DMBA per 100 g of body weight. In protocol 2, 50-day-old rats were treated with a single intragastric dose of 8 mg of DMBA per 100 g of body weight; 21 days later, they were separated into groups V and VI. Group V rats remained undisturbed, except for palpation twice a week for detection of tumor development. Group VI rats received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 100 IU of hCG for 60 days. Tumorigenesis was evaluated 24 and 30 weeks after carcinogen administration in animals in protocols 1 and 2, respectively. In protocol 1, in which animals (with the exception of the control group) were treated with hCG prior to carcinogen administration, the incidence of adenocarcinomas decreased in a dose-dependent manner, from 43.8% in the controls (group I) to 34.4%, 18.2%, and 6.15% in groups II-IV treated with 1, 10, or 100 IU of hCG, respectively. Among animals in protocol 2, hCG treatment significantly reduced the incidence of adenocarcinomas, from 100% in DMBA-treated rats (group V) to 45.5% in rats treated with DMBA plus hCG (group VI). These data indicate that hCG can prevent both initiation and progression of mammary carcinogenesis.\r"

Data from patient histories, physical examinations and laboratory evaluations were abstracted and used to control for case-mix in models comparing the rates of reoperation and mortality after transurethral versus open prostatectomy. Several models were specified. In all models the relative risk of dying after transurethral prostatectomy remained elevated (1.36 to 1.89), as did the risk for reoperation (3.62). A prospective trial is needed to establish the relative safety and effectiveness of transurethral and open prostatectomy.\r"

For this purpose we evaluated 16 men 22 to 52 years old with mild hypospadias. All patients had a urethral meatus distal to the penoscrotal junction. Serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were measured in all subjects. Dihydrotestosterone and testosterone precursors also were determined in men who had abnormally elevated levels of luteinizing hormone. The level of serum luteinizing hormone in patients was significantly higher than that of normal men, whereas the levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were similar to those of normal subjects. Of the 16 men with mild hypospadias 3 had abnormally elevated levels of gonadotropins: 2 had primary gonadal dysfunction (elevated luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone with low or normal testosterone) and 1 had hormonal evidence of partial androgen insensitivity (elevated luteinizing hormone, normal follicle-stimulating hormone with high normal testosterone and dihydrotestosterone). These patients are rather unique, since they did not have other compromising factors to account for the gonadal failure. In summary, our data demonstrated the presence of endocrine dysfunction in men with mild hypospadias.\r"

  ".W": "The experience of 272 patients with prostate cancer treated between 1976 and 1987 by external irradiation was reviewed to assess causal factors for post-irradiation incontinence and to determine measures to reduce the risk of this complication. No patient had incontinence before definitive irradiation or radical prostatectomy. Post-irradiation incontinence was observed in 19 of 272 patients (7%), including 14 with mild, 2 with moderate and 3 with severe disease. Incontinence after definitive irradiation was not significantly related to tumor stage or tumor control: 8 of 192 patients (4%) had local control and 2 of 33 (6%) had local failure. Incontinence was related to a urological operation performed in 1 of 105 patients (1%) who underwent needle biopsy and 7 of 130 (5.5%) who underwent transurethral prostatectomy before irradiation. Incontinence was more frequent, 2 of 6 patients (33%), and more severe in patients who underwent transurethral prostatectomy after irradiation. Of 31 patients 9 (29%) were incontinent after radical prostatectomy. No additional patient had incontinence after postoperative irradiation. However, 3 patients had a temporary increase in the severity of incontinence. The risk of post-irradiation incontinence may be decreased by more selective use of transurethral prostatectomy. Of 136 patients 26 (20%) underwent transurethral prostatectomy for tissue diagnosis. A needle biopsy would be the procedure of choice. A total of 29 patients with urinary outlet obstruction was treated without transurethral prostatectomy before irradiation. Ten patients with relatively mild urinary outlet obstruction were treated by irradiation alone, while 19 with more severe urinary outlet obstruction had endocrine therapy before irradiation and none of the 29 patients (0%) had post-irradiation incontinence.\r"

A brief review of the literature indicates that in the urinary tract, small cell carcinoma occurs most commonly in the bladder and is exceedingly rare in the renal pelvis; only 2 cases have been reported previously. The morphological spectrum of the small cell carcinomatous component is similar to that seen in lung tumors. Neuroendocrine differentiation of the small cell carcinoma component was supported by a positive immunoreaction to neuron-specific enolase in both cases and to synaptophysin in 1. One patient died with metastases 8 months after diagnosis, and 1 was alive with clinical evidence of lymph node metastases and contralateral papillary transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis 16 months after diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence of the potential impact of intravenous thrombolytic therapy on short-term revascularization rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction was sought. Because nonrandomized comparisons with conventional treatment would be subject to various confounders, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed. Seven trials were included, applying standard doses of either tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase without an aggressive revascularization protocol. Follow-up ranged from 14 to 30 days. The revascularization rates among treated patients in all trials were lower than in the conservative arm of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Phase II trial, which established the current procedural benchmarks for postthrombolysis management. However, the aggregate volume of bypass surgery and angioplasty in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator was more than double that of controls (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 3.94), with a smaller but still significant increase for streptokinase-treated patients (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.59). Combining all trials, the increase in mechanical revascularization was 80% (95% confidence interval, 33% to 144%). Thus, for patterns of practice currently accepted in North America, intravenous thrombolysis for myocardial infarction leads to a significant short-term increase in clinical and angiographic indications for revascularization as compared with conventional treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs) of the retina are the only neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system known to be hyperpolarized by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Both glutamate and its analogue L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) hyperpolarize DBCs by decreasing membrane conductance. Furthermore, glutamate responses in DBCs slowly decrease during whole-cell recording, suggesting that the response involves a second messenger system. Here we report that intracellular cyclic GMP or GTP activates a membrane conductance that is suppressed by APB, resulting in an enhanced APB response. In the presence of GTP-gamma-S, APB causes an irreversible suppression of the conductance. Inhibitors of G-protein activation or phosphodiesterase activity decrease the APB response. Thus, the DBC glutamate receptor seems to close ion channels by increasing the rate of cGMP hydrolysis by a G protein-mediated process that is strikingly similar to light transduction in photoreceptors.\r"

The N-end rule-based degradation signal comprises a destabilizing amino-terminal residue and a specific internal lysine residue. We now show that, in a multisubunit protein, these two determinants can be located on different subunits and still target the protein for destruction. Moreover, in this case (trans recognition) only the subunit that bears the lysine determinant is actually degraded. Thus an oligomeric protein can contain both short-lived and long-lived subunits. These insights have functional and practical implications.\r"

  ".W": "The migration of genetic information from ancestral prokaryotic endosymbionts into eukaryotic nuclei is thought to have had an important role in the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we describe an assay for the detection of movement of DNA between mitochondria and the nucleus in yeast. Because recombinant plasmid DNA replicates after transformation into mitochondria of yeast strains lacking endogenous mitochondrial DNA we were able to propagate the nuclear genetic marker URA3 in mitochondria. As expected, the wild-type URA3 gene in mitochondria failed to complement the uracil auxotrophy (Ura-) caused by a nuclear ura3 mutation. But selection of Ura+ prototrophs from a Ura- strain carrying URA3 on a plasmid in its mitochondria enabled us to detect plasmid movement to the nucleus. Conversely, as the plasmid used also contained the mitochondrial gene COX2 required for respiratory growth, we were able to set up corresponding selections to detect migration of DNA from the nucleus to the mitochondria. Our results show that, in yeast, DNA escapes from mitochondria and appears in the nucleus at a surprisingly high frequency (approximately 2 x 10(-5) per cell per generation). But the rate at which DNA makes the journey in the opposite direction--nucleus to mitochondria--is apparently at least 100,000 times less.\r"

Previous reports have suggested that bacteria present within the ear canal may be the cause of postoperative drainage. Preparation of the ear canal with povidone-iodine solutions has been recommended to decrease these infections. A prospective study evaluating the efficacy of povidone-iodine ear canal preparation before myringotomy and tube placement was performed in 111 children (220 ears) with documented chronic otitis media with effusion. One ear in each patient was prepared with povidone-iodine. The contralateral ear in each child was used as control. Postoperative otorrhea developed in seven (6.3%) of the treated ears within 14 days, compared to eleven (10%) of the ears in the control group. The difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). Purulent or mucoid middle ear effusions and edematous or granular middle ear mucosa were associated with a significantly higher incidence of postoperative otorrhea (p less than 0.05). This study suggests that postoperative otorrhea is generally a consequence of preoperative middle ear condition rather than contamination from the external canal. Antimicrobial therapy should be considered when purulent effusion or granulation tissue is seen.\r"

Moreover, two cases of traditional Western cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (TKS) have been treated with photodynamic therapy with both early and late complete response. To date, attempts at cure and palliation of the more aggressive AIDS-related oral Kaposi's sarcoma with conventional radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy, or surgical excision have been limited and often associated with debilitating mucositis and further immunosuppression. Certain aspects of photodynamic therapy may be efficacious for treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma: (1) the selective retention of hematoporphyrin derivative by neoplastic lesions; (2) a tumor-specific cytotoxic agent (i.e., free oxygen radical); (3) absence of systemic toxicity from immunosuppression; and (4) the potential for retreatment without increasing side effects. Herein we present five cases of AIDS-related KS (EKS) with diffuse, superficial, and nodular oral lesions treated with dihematoporphyrin derivative and photodynamic therapy with subsequent dramatic early partial and complete responses.\r"

The incidence of postoperative hemorrhage after tonsillectomy, as well as many factors affecting this incidence, has been extensively investigated. A possible factor that has not been well studied as a possible influence in postoperative tonsillectomy bleeding is the choice of anesthetic. A study was completed comparing the incidence of postoperative tonsillectomy bleeding between patients operated on using general anesthetic and local anesthetic. One hundred ninety-two patients consecutively undergoing tonsillectomy at Naval Hospital, Oakland, California, were included in the study. Three of 150 patients (3%) having general anesthesia and 13 of 87 patients (15%) having local anesthesia experienced postoperative bleeding. Possible factors influencing this difference in postoperative bleeding incidence are discussed. The possibility is suggested that surgeons (and previous reports) may underestimate the rates of postoperative bleeding as a result of patients being treated by other than the operating physician.\r"

While there is no readily identifiable cause, there is some recovery of function within 6 months. This article offers practical guidelines for diagnosing and treating Bell's palsy. These guidelines are based on the author's experience with 63 patients over the last 8 years. Physical examination should reveal diffuse nerve involvement, normal otoscopic findings, and no skin blebs or blisters and parotid masses. Other cranial nerve palsies may be present. Diagnostic testing should include basic audiometry if available, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scanning if paralysis is present. Facial photography is recommended. Topognostic testing is not helpful because it no longer guides the surgical approach, and prognostic tests are not necessary if the face is not paralyzed. The only sufficiently sensitive test to determine the need for possible surgery is electroneurography. Eye care is critical in all but the mildest cases, and steroids may also be helpful. Surgery is rarely needed and should consist only of middle fossa total decompression; simple decompression of the tympanic and mastoid segments is seldom helpful. The natural history of the disease and the limited role of surgery provide new guidelines for practical management of Bell's palsy.\r"

Over a 9-month period we have reviewed Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI scans on 32 consecutive cases (35 tumors) involving the internal auditory canal (IAC) and cerebellopontine angle (CPA). The majority of patients (84%) were imaged on latest generation 1.5 Tesla scanners. Every tumor studied showed marked enhancement after Gd-DTPA administration. This improved contrast permitted identification of three small tumors that were not evident on unenhanced scans. Gd-DTPA appears to be particularly useful in the evaluation of recurrent or residual AN. In three patients with known residual tumor after planned subtotal excisions, the remaining tumor could only be differentiated from surrounding scar, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and brain parenchyma after contrast enhancement. In one of these, a small rim of tumor capsule left on the facial nerve was evident only on Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1 images. Gd-DTPA also provides a more reliable estimate of the depth of tumor penetration in the IAC. This information is useful in selecting candidates suitable for a hearing conservation approach.\r"

Of the 19 ears with normal preoperative summating potential/action potential (SP/AP) ratio, ten had perilymph fistula identified at the time of surgery. Of the 20 ears with abnormal SP/AP ratio, 16 had perilymph fistula confirmed at exploration, 18 had resolution of symptoms after oval window and round membrane grafting, and only one ear had postoperative persistence of the abnormal SP/AP ratio. This study suggests that an abnormal SP/AP ratio is not only predictive of endolymphatic hydrops, but also of perilymph fistula (both problems of inner ear fluid imbalance). This study also suggests that, while abnormal SP/AP ratio is fairly specific for inner ear fluid imbalance, it is not sensitive.\r"

However, all investigators had some subjects in every category: postlingual, prelingual, and congenital. Auditory discrimination and speech production scores for subjects from the three groups were compared using analysis of variance techniques. A few interaction effects between time interval and investigator indicated that not all investigator groups performed similarly over time for all measures. However, postimplant scores were always significantly higher than preimplant scores for all investigators. Differences that did occur appeared to be attributable to differences in subject characteristics.\r"

Two cases of ossicular fixation and conductive hearing loss after retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section prompted us to examine the issue of bone dust in the middle ear. In a study of 13 temporal bones that had undergone neurotologic surgery, we found 11 that showed evidence of viable bone dust in the middle ear, and three that had ossicular fixation. Viable bone dust was always encased in a mucous membrane lining. These findings suggest that bone dust that enters the middle ear may indeed remain viable and cause ossicular fixation. The surgeon should therefore take every precaution to prevent bone dust from entering the middle ear during neurotologic procedures in which conservation of hearing is attempted.\r"

The cat with the more active leak had a spontaneous nystagmus toward the side of the fistula on the first postoperative day; this changed to nystagmus toward the opposite side by the third postoperative day. The other cats had a spontaneous nystagmus toward the opposite side from the first postoperative day. Most abnormal test results returned to normal in the first week after fistulization. Histologic study of the temporal bones revealed that the cat with the greater leak had a wider cochlear aqueduct than the other cats.\r"

The patients ranged from 14 months to 79 years of age. The most common tumor sites from which sphenoid metastases arose were the prostate and the lung. In 11 of the 26 cases, the sphenoid sinus metastasis was the first presentation of malignancy. Patients manifested signs and symptoms that were indistinguishable from those from primary tumors of the sinus. They included headache, facial pain, visual changes, and single or multiple cranial neuropathies. While cure of patients with sphenoid metastasis has not been reported, significant palliation with resolution of morbidity is possible in many patients with radiation therapy. Although metastasis to the sphenoid sinus is an uncommon entity, when present, signs and symptoms relating to this metastasis are frequently the first presentation of disease. As such, patients with sphenoid sinus symptoms suggestive of sphenoid sinus malignancy should be vigorously evaluated for the possibility of primary as well as metastatic tumor of the sinus.\r"

In this study, we used fixed cadaver specimens to identify visible landmarks for accurate placement of the central electroauditory prosthesis through a combined suboccipital-translabyrinthine opening. Histologic features of the regions of probable implantation of the central electroauditory prosthesis were also investigated. We found that the following landmarks might have surgical significance: (1) the tenia of the inferior velum of the fourth ventricle, which crosses the surface of the ventral cochlear nucleus and the vestibulocochlear nerve; (2) the angle between the vestibulocochlear and glossopharyngeal nerves; and (3) the foramen of Luschka. It is suggested that an incision be made in the tenia for insertion of the prosthesis into the lateral recess and eventual placement on the ventral cochlear nucleus surface. To study regions of potential stimulation, we injected ink into different sites on the exposed surface of the cochlear nuclei. We then histologically examined neuronal populations adjacent to the sites. We found that a portion of the ventral cochlear nucleus localized within the lateral recess might be the most appropriate location for placement of the central electroauditory prosthesis.\r"

Adaptive changes in how these sensory inputs influence posture may occur in the presence of vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we simulated vestibular dysfunction in normal subjects in order to study immediate and adaptive modifications in postural control under reproducible and reversible experimental conditions. Twenty subjects (ages 20 to 35 years) were tested on a force-detecting platform; the support surface or visual surround was modulated (anterior-posterior) proportionally to body sway. Vestibular dysfunction was simulated by rotating subjects with their eyes closed at 180 degrees/second for 30 seconds, then rapidly halting rotation. Posturographic measures were obtained during the subsequent 20 seconds. Ten identical rotation trials for each subject were performed, alternating the direction of rotation, and with either the support surface or the visual surround modulated with sway in different subjects. Thus, only one sensory modality could provide Earth-stable sensory cues. Control groups were tested to assess effects of repeated alternating rotations alone, and effects of repeated posturographic trials alone. Sway was quantified by measuring peak-to-peak excursions of the center of mass. Results showed that subjects were more stable after rotation when they were provided with a stable support surface than with a stable visual surround. No subject could maintain stance without at least one Earth-stable sensory input. Improvement of mean sway scores in either group was not significant, although isolated cases did exhibit adaptive changes with improved stability over repeated trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Angioedema is a disorder characterized by well-demarcated nonpitting edema involving the tongue, floor of the mouth, larynx, lips, and face. This condition can progress to upper airway obstruction and death. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), relatively new antihypertensive agents, act by blocking the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone formation. ACEIs also retard the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, which may lead to the edema seen in nonhereditary angioedema. These ACEIs include enalapril, captopril, lisinopril, saralasin acetate, and a combination of ACEI with diuretics (for example, Capozide). From August 1987 to January 1989, we treated six patients with a nonhereditary form of angioedema related to ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Symptoms developed in all patients within 12 hours after their initial dose of an ACEI. They presented with shortness of breath and dysphagia associated with tongue and floor of the mouth edema. Two of the six required intubation and monitoring in the surgical intensive care unit for 36 to 48 hours. Three required supportive treatment and observation in an intermediate care unit, and one received supportive care in the clinic and was discharged the same day. Specifically, treatment consisted of cessation of inciting agent, steroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine, if not otherwise contraindicated. Assays of C1 esterase inhibitor levels and C4 were normal in all six patients; this was important in order to rule out hereditary forms of angioedema. These cases will be discussed, including a review of the literature, methods of diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of angioedema.\r"

  ".U": "90326440\r", 
  ".W": "The role of endolymphatic sac (ES) dysfunction in the etiopathogenesis of Meniere's disease has remained controversial since the early 1900s. The first reports of the ultrastructural (transmission electron microscopy, TEM) pathology of the human ES in Meniere's disease have been published only in the last decade. These studies have been based on biopsies of the extraosseous (intradural) ES and in no cases has the TEM appearance of the intraosseous ES been described. Likewise the control material used has been from biopsies of extraosseous ES taken from patients with acoustic schwannomas. To date, no reports have compared the ultrastructure of the intrasosseous ES from normal control patients to patients with Meniere's disease. Since the intraosseous ES is believed to be the most active portion of the entire ES, studies were made of the ultrastructure of ten normal interosseous human ESs fixed immediately after death and obtained at autopsy (control material). Fourteen patients undergoing translabyrinthine (TL) neurotologic procedures (10, TL resection of acoustic schwannoma; 4, TL eighth cranial nerve section for Meniere's disease) had the entire vestibular aqueduct, containing the endolymphatic duct and the intraosseous ES, removed and processed for TEM. The roles of the epithelium, subepithelial space, and vasculature were morphologically studied to evaluate possible ES pathology in Meniere's disease and in patients with acoustic schwannoma. Wide anatomic variation in the distribution and density of the subepithelial connective tissue was observed in all groups. There was no difference in the TEM appearance of the intraosseous ES from normal controls and patients with eighth nerve schwannoma, nor was there any difference in the ES collagen deposition in patients with Meniere's disease. The ESs from two patients with Meniere's disease showed evidence of abnormal glycoprotein metabolism; one with possible hypersecretion and one with possible alteration of degradation of resorbed glycoprotein. The results of this preliminary study suggest that \"perisaccular fibrosis\" of the intraosseous ES was not a pathologic feature in these four cases of Meniere's disease and that alteration of ES glycoprotein secretion/resorption may be of etiopathologic significance.\r"

CPFs interacted with gp120 and did not interfere with the binding of CD4 to class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. One CPF isomer, CPF(DD), preserved CD4-dependent T cell function while inhibiting HIV-1 infection of H9 tumor cells and human T cells. Although the production of viral proteins in infected T cells is unaltered by CPF(DD), this compound prevents the spread of infection in an in vitro model system.\r"

The mechanism of this protection has been investigated by breeding wild-type and promoter-mutated E kappa alpha transgenes onto the NOD genetic background. Animals carrying the various mutated transgenes expressed I-E on different subsets of immunocompetent cells, and thus cells important for the I-E protective effect could be identified. Although the wild-type transgene prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets, none of the mutants did. However, all of the transgenes could mediate the intrathymic elimination of T cells bearing antigen receptors with variable regions that recognize I-E. Thus, the I-E molecule does not protect NOD mice from diabetes simply by inducing the deletion of self-reactive T cells.\r"

The relative risk of complications such as intrauterine growth retardation, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirth in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies also remains undetermined. Heightened attention has been focused on the association, leading to investigations into the pathogenesis. Uncontrolled studies have also explored therapeutic regimens such as aspirin, steroids, and heparin, and clinical trials have used various treatment protocols. Although knowledge into the association of antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent adverse pregnancy outcome is limited and continues to evolve, this association provides new insights into the disease and offers promise for pharmacologic prophylaxis. In this article, current concepts on pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy are reviewed and recommendations are made for clinical care of these patients.\r"

Nearly 30% of infected infants have concomitant meningitis and half suffer permanent neurologic damage. Group B streptococci also account for at least 20% of postpartum metritis. The annual cost of group B streptococci infection in the United States is conservatively estimated at nearly 2000 neonatal deaths and greater than $500 million, excluding the costs of long-term neurologic handicaps. Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis with ampicillin is effective in curtailing transmission of group B streptococci from mother to infant. Methods have been developed to identify maternal colonization before delivery. We applied principles of decision analysis to evaluate cost-effectiveness of intrapartum screening for maternal group B streptococci colonization with various reported methods in cohorts of low- and high-risk women. In the United States intrapartum screening for group B streptococci is cost-effective and offers the potential to avert a significant number of neonatal deaths and postpartum infections.\r"

To determine whether acute intravascular volume expansion affects atrial natriuretic factor concentrations during pregnancy, circulating atrial natriuretic factor levels were measured in pregnant women at term (before elective cesarean section) and nonpregnant control subjects before and during intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer's solution (approximately 30 ml/kg). Venous plasma concentrations of alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor were determined by a specific radioimmunoassay. A significant increase in alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor levels in nonpregnant subjects was seen. Pregnant women did not show a significant response to a similar stimulus. Finally, basal alpha-human atrial natriuretic factor levels in pregnant and nonpregnant women were not different. Volume expansion (long-term or short-term) in normal human pregnancy may not be sensed by atrial volume sensors, possibly because it is accommodated by an enlarged maternal vascular compartment.\r"

Using a monoclonal antibody and immunohistochemical techniques, we studied the localization of this enzyme in the female reproductive tract and in endometriosis. In the uterus, prostaglandin H synthase was primarily localized to endometrial epithelium with surface epithelium containing more immunoreactive prostaglandin H synthase than glandular epithelium. Fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells also contained prostaglandin H synthase while ciliated epithelial cells did not. Cervical epithelium and myometrial cells did not contain prostaglandin H synthase. A higher percentage of glands in endometriosis and adenomyosis, as compared with eutopic endometrium, contained prostaglandin H synthase suggesting that these tissues are also capable of prostaglandin synthesis. These findings may have important physiologic significance in the mechanisms of embryo implantation, in menstruation, and in the pathophysiologic features of endometriosis.\r"

Dexmedetomidine was given in a dose (10 micrograms/kg) reported to reduce the anesthetic requirement of halothane by 90%. During 0.9% halothane anesthesia dexmedetomidine caused a significant reduction in CBF without influencing the metabolic rate for oxygen. Reducing the halothane concentration to 0.1% caused no further change in CBF, but increased the metabolic rate for oxygen 19%. The cerebral vasoconstrictive effect, combined with the 90% reduction in MAC for halothane, indicates that dexmedetomidine might be a useful adjunct to inhalation anesthetics during neurosurgery in situations where an increase in CBF should be avoided.\r"

In the present study, the authors investigated for the first time the association of Takayasu's arteritis and HLA at the genomic level. By use of a restriction endonuclease Taq-I and a DQA cDNA probe, HLA-D region restriction fragment length polymorphism was examined in 32 Japanese patients. It was revealed that 65.6% of the patients shared a 6.6 kb fragment, although this fragment was found in 35.3% of the healthy Japanese (Chi square: 6.07, p less than 0.02). This finding suggest that HLA-D region gene variations determine susceptibility to Takayasu's arteritis.\r"

To evaluate the effect of myocardial ischemia on contractility, E-MAX was measured from serial pressure volume loops at baseline, with atrial pacing-induced ischemia, and after the administration of intravenous nitroglycerin with repeat pacing. Ten patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for presumed coronary artery disease were evaluated by this method. The severity of the coronary artery disease was graded angiographically by using the Gensini coronary score. In 8 of the 10 patients there was a significant decrease in E-MAX during atrial pacing (P less than .05). With the administration of nitroglycerin there was an attenuation of the ischemic effect previously noted with pacing. In 3 of the 10 patients administration of nitroglycerin produced a further decrease in E-MAX with ischemia. All 3 patients had a significantly lower Gensini coronary score with a well-developed, visible coronary collateral network. The authors' results indicate that continuous pressure volume loop analysis is possible using the nuclear stethoscope. Significant ischemic changes are seen with atrial pacing, which are relieved by the administration of nitroglycerin, except in the presence of coronary collaterals.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, interventional trial using an alternate month study design. SETTING: A large teaching community hospital. PATIENTS: Cohort of 404 low-risk patients with chest pain for whom a diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been excluded and who have not sustained complications, required interventions, or developed unstable comorbidity. INTERVENTIONS: During intervention months, private practitioners caring for low-risk patients in the coronary and intermediate care units were contacted 24 hours after admission. Physicians were informed that the transfer of low-risk patients to nonmonitored beds could probably be done safely, based on the results of a pilot study. The practitioner had the option of agreeing to or deferring patient transfer. During control months, physicians were not contacted in this way. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of the triage criteria by private practitioners reduced lengths of stay in the intermediate and coronary care units by 36% and 53%, respectively. Bed availability increased by 744 intermediate and 372 coronary care unit bed-days per year. Charges decreased by $2.6 million per year and profits improved by $390,000 per year. There were not significant differences in complications between control and intervention patients and in no case (95% CI, 0% to 1.6%) did the triage criteria adversely affect quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: The early transfer triage criteria may be a safe and efficacious decision aid for improving bed utilization in intermediate and coronary care units. In addition, this study shows the feasibility of and potential benefits from applying practice guidelines at a community hospital.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A long-term residential care facility for elderly persons. SUBJECTS: Within 7 days of a fall, 160 ambulatory subjects (mean age, 87 years) were randomly assigned to receive either a comprehensive postfall assessment (intervention group, n = 79) or usual care (control group, n = 81). INTERVENTION: The postfall assessment included a detailed physical examination and environmental assessment by a nurse practitioner; laboratory tests; electrocardiogram; and 24-hour Holter monitoring. Probable cause or causes for the fall, identified risk factors, and therapeutic recommendations were given to the patient's primary physician. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Through use of the assessment, many remediable problems (for example, weakness, environmental hazards, orthostatic hypotension, drug side effects, gait dysfunction) were detected. At the end of the 2-year follow-up period, the intervention group had 26% fewer hospitalizations (P less than 0.05) and a 52% reduction in hospital days (P less than 0.01) compared with controls. Patients in the intervention group had 9% fewer falls and 17% fewer deaths than controls by 2 years, but these trends were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that falls are a marker of underlying disorders easily identifiable by a careful postfall assessment, which in turn can reduce disability and costs.\r"

This study analyzed the relationship between time of transfer to a Level I Trauma Center with a spinal cord injury service and efficacy of subsequent rehabilitation. We examined the records of all patients admitted to the service between September 1981 and August 1983 and followed at least one year. There were 197 patients, 102 quadriplegics and 95 paraplegics, aged 15 to 77 years (average = 29.4 years). Median time from injury to admission was 11 days for quadriplegics and 21 days for paraplegics; this was used to define early and late groups. The early quadriplegic group began rehabilitation 2.94 days postinjury; the late quadriplegic group, 74.87 days (p less than .01). Time in rehabilitation did not differ (128.22 days, early; 122.61, late), but total hospitalization--from injury to discharge--was 131.16 days for the early quadriplegic group and 197.27 for the late quadriplegic group (p less than .01). Average duration of prerehabilitation care for the paraplegic groups was 6.19 days (early) and 58.58 days (late) (p less than .01). Time in rehabilitation was the same for both paraplegic groups, but total hospitalization was shorter for early admissions (82.91 days vs 125.90 days, p less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It increased with progression of disability and showed significant correlations with the cardiothoracic ratio and the ratio of the preejection period to the left ventricular ejection time. In patients with other types of muscular dystrophy, the plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration showed no significant change. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated many atrial natriuretic peptide-positive cells in atrial muscle of an autopsied patient, indicating preservation of the peptide until the end stage. These findings suggest that measurement of the plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration is useful for evaluating heart failure in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol administration disorders protein trafficking in the liver. The protein secretory and plasma membrane assembly pathways have been shown to be impaired in the liver of ethanol-treated animals; however, traffic along the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway appears to be especially susceptible to alterations by ethanol. Using asialoglycoproteins as model ligands for studying receptor-mediated endocytosis, we have identified at least three steps of this multi-step pathway that are affected by ethanol treatment. These altered steps are recycling of the receptor, internalization of the receptor-ligand complex and dissociation of the ligand from its receptor in endosomes. Ethanol-induced derangements of endocytosis are more severe in the perivenule region, where alcoholic liver injury starts and predominates, than in the periportal region of the liver. In addition, recent studies have shown that the endocytosis of other ligands, including epidermal growth factor and insulin, are also altered by ethanol treatment. Mechanisms which have been proposed to explain faulty endocytosis include: acetaldehyde adducts to tubulin resulting in impaired microtubule function, improper acidification of endosomes and defective receptor clustering in coated pits. Since receptor-mediated endocytosis by the liver represents an important process by which levels of various hormones, growth factors and other ligands are regulated, and since endocytosis may also be an integral process by which the biological effects of various ligands are elicited, changes in this important process could disrupt numerous metabolic and homeostatic events in the liver and total organism.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine whether endothelial injury contributes to augmented coronary vascular tone seen during myocardial reperfusion. Canine left anterior descending coronary arteries were exposed to ischemia followed by reperfusion (60 minutes each). Rings (3-4 mm) of the reperfused artery and of normal left circumflex (control) coronary artery segments were prepared. Rings were suspended for isometric force measurement in organ chambers containing modified Krebs' Ringer bicarbonate solution (37 degrees C, 95% O2-5% CO2). Endothelium-independent contractions to KCl and prostaglandin F2 alpha were unaltered after reperfusion. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to nitric oxide, sodium nitroprusside, and isoproterenol were comparable in control and reperfused arteries. However, reperfused coronary arteries contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha lost the ability to express endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets. Reperfused arterial rings also exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, the calcium ionophore A23187, and the platelet-derived compounds ADP and serotonin. Quiescent (noncontracted) reperfused arterial rings exhibited larger contractions than controls when exposed to aggregating platelets. In such quiescent rings, the endothelium-dependent increase in tension to hemoglobin was unaltered after reperfusion. Thus, coronary reperfusion impairs the normal endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets and vasoactive drugs. This impairment of platelet-mediated coronary relaxation could help explain the increased vascular tone and tendency toward vasospasm commonly observed after reperfusion of the coronary arteries.\r"

Intracellular potassium decreased to 60.2 +/- 4.3% of the control level (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) at 40 minutes from the start of metabolic inhibition (2 mM cyanide, 0 mM glucose). Removal of cyanide restored intracellular potassium to 94.2 +/- 3.9% at 30 minutes from the restart of oxidative metabolism. The cumulative potassium loss was determined from the flow rate and potassium concentration of the coronary effluent, which reached 139 +/- 12 mumol/g dry wt during 40 minutes of metabolic inhibition. This value was calculated as 41.8% of intracellular potassium in the control heart and agreed with the decrement of intracellular potassium measured by NMR. During the metabolic inhibition and recovery period, a linear correlation was observed between the changes in 39K NMR-observed intracellular potassium and the cumulative potassium loss. The present results evaluate the inversion recovery technique as a method to successfully monitor the myocardial intracellular potassium.\r"

  ".W": "Acidosis induces vasodilation both in vivo and in vitro. Although it is commonly surmised that acidosis alters contractility by affecting contractile proteins and calcium entry, the exact role of these mechanisms in acidosis-induced vasodilation has not been determined. In the present study, we demonstrated that a novel mechanism, involving increased calcium sequestration into intracellular sites sensitive to norepinephrine, mediates the vasodilation associated with relatively modest decreases in pH. The effects of changing pH from 7.4 to 7.0 on tension development, 45Ca fluxes, and the norepinephrine-releasable intracellular calcium stores were studied in isolated rat aorta. Acute acidification produced marked endothelium-independent dilations of aortic rings that had been precontracted with norepinephrine. In contrast, this maneuver had only modest effects on contractions elicited by 80 mM KCl or phorbol ester. Acidification in this range did not alter basal or norepinephrine-stimulated undirectional 45Ca influx, nor did it reduce the norepinephrine-induced net gain in 45Ca content. Furthermore, neither norepinephrine-stimulated 45Ca efflux nor the peak contractile response to norepinephrine in calcium-free buffer was affected, although in this setting, the duration of the phasic contractile response was shortened. When calcium was restored to tissues exposed to norepinephrine in calcium-free buffer, acidification slowed the rate of tension development without altering 45Ca uptake, thus changing the relation between tension development and calcium entry. These effects of acidification were shown to be associated with an increase in the amount of calcium sequestered into the norepinephrine-sensitive intracellular calcium store. These findings clearly indicate that acidification, within a range that has no effect on other aspects of smooth muscle activation, elicits vasodilation by stimulating intracellular calcium sequestration. This action may represent a predominant mechanism whereby acidosis alters vascular smooth muscle contractility.\r"

Examination of the mechanisms by which ANF alters microcirculatory fluid and protein transfer will likely require studies in localized vascular regions. This study was aimed at determining the specific organs in which ANF increases the escape of albumin. Anesthetized, splenectomized rats that had both kidneys removed were infused with vehicle alone or rat ANF-(99-126) at 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1 for 2 hours (n = 8 per group). Total red cell and plasma volumes were measured with chromium-51-labeled erythrocytes and iodine-125-labeled albumin, respectively. At the end of 2 hours, the rats were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and organ blood volumes and tissue 125I-albumin were determined. ANF decreased plasma volume at infusion rates of 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1. ANF increased the rate at which 125I-albumin escaped from the overall circulation at infusion rates of 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1. At an ANF infusion rate of 0.1 micrograms.min-1.kg-1, the albumin escape rate increased in the gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscle, heart, and lungs. At an infusion rate of 0.5 micrograms.min-1.kg-1, the albumin escape rate increased in the gastrointestinal tract, muscle, and skin, but not the lungs. These findings suggest that at pathophysiological levels, ANF shifts protein out of the circulation in peripheral vascular beds and the lungs and may contribute to pulmonary edema in states such as congestive heart failure. At pharmacological levels, ANF may be protective of the lungs by preventing increased pulmonary albumin escape.\r"

Cells were then rapidly skinned by Triton X-100, and force was recorded after gluing the cells to a strain gauge. The skinned cells had mechanical properties very similar to those described for thin trabeculas. Tension-pCa relations were highly reproducible from one cell to another, with sarcomere length fixed at 2.1 microns. The application of alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic agonists, which increase the turnover of phosphatidylinositol, for 5 minutes before skinning the cells increased the sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium, as indicated by a leftward shift of the tension-pCa relation, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulation induced a rightward shift. The increase in calcium sensitivity was also evoked by protein kinase C activators such as 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate but not by protein kinase C itself or by purinergic agonists, although the latter also increased the turnover of phosphatidylinositol. Incubation of the skinned cells with phosphatase reversed the alterations in calcium sensitivity induced by previous agonist stimulation of the intact cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a potentially influential mechanism for the physiological regulation of cardiac muscle contractility.\r"

  ".W": "In cremaster muscle of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, temporary occlusion of an arteriole increased red blood cell velocity (mean increase, 8.2 +/- 1.0 mm/sec from a control velocity of 7.9 +/- 0.7 mm/sec) in proximal parallel arteriolar branches (mean control diameter, 19.4 +/- 0.6 microns). Increases in flow velocity were consistently followed by proportional delayed (6-15 seconds) increases in arteriolar diameter (5.8 +/- 0.7 microns). Administration of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (200 microM), an inhibitor of the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor that blocked the arteriolar responses to acetylcholine (1 microM) but not to arachidonic acid (10 microM), did not affect the dilation (mean increase, 8.9 +/- 1.1 microns) due to increases in red blood cell velocity (13.4 +/- 1.5 mm/sec). However, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (or meclofenamate), which completely blocked the dilator response to arachidonic acid but did not change the response to acetylcholine, inhibited the arteriolar dilation (mean increase, 0.3 +/- 0.2 micron) due to increases in red blood cell velocity (9.3 +/- 1.0 mm/sec). Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis also reduced the increase in calculated blood flow by 57% during occlusion. These results suggest that the arterioles are sensitive to increases in blood flow velocity (wall shear stress), in response to which they release prostaglandins, eliciting vasodilation. The existence of this phenomenon in the skeletal muscle microcirculation suggests a new regulatory mechanism that, by modulation of vascular resistance in the microvascular network, has the role of normalizing wall shear stress and providing for substantial increases in tissue blood flow.\r"

In order to test this hypothesis, the effect of restoration of a normal renal function on TBG immunoreactivity was evaluated. TBG concentration was measured in 20 patients both by radioimmunoassay and by a T4-binding capacity assay, before, 4 and 10 months after a successful renal transplantation. Mean pretransplant TBG value measured by RIA was in the low normal range (1.60 +/- 0.14 mg/dl; normal limits 1.6-2.4 mg/dl). Twelve patients (60%) had TBG levels below 1.6 mg/dl (group I), while T4-binding capacity of TBG (TBC) measured in 7 of them was normal, so that the TBG/TBC ratio was characteristically reduced. The 8 remaining patients (group II) had TBG levels within or slightly above the normal range (mean value 2.26 +/- 0.17 mg/dl) and in the 5 tested patients, TBC and TBG/TBC ratio were normal. Four months after transplantation, mean TBG increased significantly in group I from 1.15 +/- 0.03 mg/dl before transplantation to 1.54 +/- 0.12 mg/dl (p less than 0.01). TBC increased also from 269 +/- 37.5 to 335 +/- 24 nmol/l (p less than 0.01) but to a significantly lesser extent than TBG (24% vs 48%, p less than 0.05). As a result, the TBG/TBC ratio returned to normal values, rising from 0.79 +/- 0.07 to 0.95 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The Chicago Lung Association, with funding from Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois, conducted a community action project to determine the magnitude of the issues in Illinois. The purposes of the VAI Study were to ascertain needs and resources, generate recommendations, and recruit community involvement. The survey identified 453 VAIs: 145 in hospitals, 105 in extended-care facilities, and 203 at home. A majority (62 percent) of hospitals provided services to VAIs; many more would with proper reimbursement incentives. Only 60 percent of hospitals serving VAIs had active discharge teams; discharge was accomplished by a variety of mechanisms and personnel. Monthly hospital charges averaged $22,190 with a range from $10,020 to $66,750 depending on the location of the patient. Most reimbursement was public; private funding was fragmented. Major discharge barriers were inadequate payment for community-based services, limited community resources, constrained consumer's finances, and lack of access to information. Recommendations for future community action included establishing a technology transfer system, home care case management, an integrated management system, a documentation center, and trials and demonstrations prior to program and policy development.\r"

  ".U": "90330889\r", 
  ".W": "This study was performed to investigate the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and mannitol on renal blood flow (RBF) and radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) in human subjects with chronic renal failure. ANP preserves glomerular filtration rate or RBF (or both) in severe animal models of acute renal failure. Radiocontrast is known to substantially decrease RBF and can induce acute renal failure. Twenty consecutive patients with chronic renal failure (60% with diabetes) were randomized in a prospective, double-blind fashion to receive either ANP (50 micrograms bolus, then 1 microgram/min infusion) or mannitol (15% at 100 ml/hr) for 2 hours before and during cardiac catheterization with diatrizoate. Baseline serum creatinine level (ANP 2.4 +/- 0.7 mg/dl, mannitol 2.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dl), medications, and quantity of radiocontrast were similar in both groups. Direct measurements of RBF were made with thermodilution catheters placed in the left renal vein. RBF rose significantly (p less than 0.05), to 198% of baseline at 15 minutes and 166% of baseline at 65 minutes in the group receiving ANP and remained stable in the group receiving mannitol. ANP levels rose significantly from baseline at 5, 15, 65 and 120 minutes in both groups (p less than 0.05). Acute renal failure defined as a 0.5 mg/dl rise of creatinine within 24 hours of cardiac catheterization, developed only in patients with diabetes mellitus and was similar in both experimental groups (ANP, 50%; mannitol, 30%). Only patients with diabetes mellitus responded with an increase in RBF after a 5-minute infusion of either ANP or mannitol (diabetes, 165% +/- 28% baseline; no diabetes, 96% +/- 8% baseline) (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, RBF was maintained or increased despite administration of radiocontrast, a documented renal vasoconstrictor. Patients with diabetes mellitus had a renal vasodilatory response to drug infusion. Acute renal failure occurred to a similar extent in both groups. Plasma ANP levels rose significantly in both groups. Mannitol may induce ANP release, thus contributing to mannitol's renal effects.\r"

End-tidal CO2 tension was followed to determine if falls in oxygen saturation during labor were related to hyperventilation. Ten of the 15 patients exhibited periods of oxygen saturation of less than 90%. End-tidal CO2 was consistently low, usually less than 30 mm Hg. Most, but not all (7 of 10), of the patients who showed desaturation had received narcotics. There were often periods of apnea and/or shallow respirations between contractions. These aberrations and hyperventilation-induced hypocarbia were probably the cause of the oxygen desaturation. No changes in fetal heart rate or low Apgar scores were noted.\r"

The absence of response possibly was the consequence of the patient's estrogen deficiency. The response of thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin and cortisol was normal after provocative pituitary stimulation. Central nervous system sarcoidosis occurs in 3.5-5.0% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Hypothalamic or pituitary sarcoidosis occurs in approximately 0.5% of patients. Diabetes insipidus and hyperprolactinemia are the most frequent manifestations of hypothalamic-pituitary sarcoidosis, occurring in one-half and one-third, respectively, of such patients. Menstrual disturbances, including amenorrhea, are reported infrequently. Computed tomography and provocative pituitary-hypothalamic testing are useful in detecting central nervous system sarcoidosis and in delineating the site of involvement.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Antiepileptic drugs are commonly used to prevent seizures that may follow head trauma. However, previous controlled studies of this practice have been inconclusive. METHODS. To study further the effectiveness of phenytoin (Dilantin) in preventing post-traumatic seizures, we randomly assigned 404 eligible patients with serious head trauma to treatment with phenytoin (n = 208) or placebo (n = 196) for one year in a double-blind fashion. An intravenous loading dose was given within 24 hours of injury. Serum levels of phenytoin were maintained in the high therapeutic range (3 to 6 mumol of free phenytoin per liter). Follow-up was continued for two years. The primary data analysis was performed according to the intention to treat. RESULTS. Between drug loading and day 7, 3.6 percent of the patients assigned to phenytoin had seizures, as compared with 14.2 percent of patients assigned to placebo (P less than 0.001; risk ratio, 0.27; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.62). Between day 8 and the end of year 1, 21.5 percent of the phenytoin group and 15.7 percent of the placebo group had seizures; at the end of year 2, the rates were 27.5 percent and 21.1 percent, respectively (P greater than 0.2 for each comparison; risk ratio, 1.20; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 2.02). This lack of a late effect could not be attributed to differential mortality, low phenytoin levels, or treatment of some early seizures in patients assigned to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS. Phenytoin exerts a beneficial effect by reducing seizures only during the first week after severe head injury.\r"

  ".U": "90331960\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In patients with stable coronary artery disease, the ischemic threshold for the production of effort-related angina is often quite variable. Although this feature is commonly attributed to changes in the caliber of coronary arteries at the site of stenosis, it could also be caused by the constriction of distal vessels, collateral vessels, or both. METHODS. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied 11 patients with stable angina, total occlusion of a single coronary artery that was supplied by collateral vessels, normal ventricular function, no evidence of coronary-artery spasm, and no other coronary stenoses. These conditions precluded the modulation of coronary flow by vasomotion at the site of the coronary stenosis. RESULTS. The ischemic threshold--assessed by multiplying the heart rate by the systolic blood pressure at a 1-mm depression of the ST segment during exercise testing--increased by 19 percent after the administration of nitroglycerin (P less than 0.05) and decreased by 18 percent after the administration of ergonovine (P less than 0.01). Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring of the patients when not receiving treatment detected 73 ischemic episodes that, in keeping with the history, showed variations of 25 to 52 beats per minute in the heart rate at a 1-mm depression of the ST segment; 12 episodes of sinus tachycardia exceeded the lowest ischemic heart rate by a mean (+/- SD) of 22 +/- 13 beats per minute without ST-segment depression. Furthermore, 21 ischemic episodes occurred at a heart rate more than 25 beats per minute below that at a 1-mm depression of the ST segment during exercise testing. Delayed and reduced filling of collateral and collateralized vessels associated with depression of the ST segment similar to that observed during ambulatory monitoring was detected on angiographic evaluation after the intracoronary administration of ergonovine in three patients. CONCLUSIONS. We propose that the constriction of distal coronary arteries, collateral vessels, or both may cause myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina.\r"
