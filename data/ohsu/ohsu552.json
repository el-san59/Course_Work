In 81 instances (23%), the clinical impact of the chest radiographs was incorrectly predicted and significant alterations in management would have potentially been missed had the chest radiographs not been available. These 81 chest radiographs included 72 unpredicted radiographic changes of clinical significance, and nine chest radiographs in which a significant radiographic change was incorrectly predicted. Thirty five (43.2%) of these 81 chest radiographs had unpredicted pulmonary findings and 46 (56.8%) showed unpredicted appliance malpositions. Incorrect predictions were significantly associated with radiographs from patients who were younger, intubated, mechanically ventilated, and had indwelling central venous catheters. Level of training of the predicting physicians did not affect prediction accuracy. In analysis of 43 routine postintubation chest radiographs and 39 routine postcentral venous catheter placement chest radiographs, appliance malpositions were disclosed in 34.9% and 43.6%, respectively. Routine daily and post-appliance placement chest radiographs have significant clinical value in the pediatric intensive care unit.\r"

No significant relationship was found between otitis media in early childhood and performance on tests of verbal intelligence or academic achievement in the third year of school. The number of days of otitis media before 3 years of age was significantly correlated with teachers' ratings of children's attentional behavior in the classroom, however. Children with more early otitis media tended to be rated as less task oriented and less able to work independently than children with less otitis media. This was an exploratory study of a small number of children. Further study of the potential association is needed.\r"

Data from a population-based register of handicapping conditions in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and a birth weight-specific census of live-born infants in British Columbia, were used to determine annual, population-level incidences of retinopathy of prematurity-induced blindness during 1952 to 1983. Changes in incidence since the end of the original epidemic (1954) were determined by subdividing the 29-year period (1955 to 1983) into two intervals (1955 to 1964 and 1965 to 1983). Standardized incidence ratio analyses revealed a marginally significant increase in the overall incidence of retinopathy of prematurity-induced blindness in the later as compared with the earlier period. Infants weighing 750 to 999 g at birth had a significantly increased standardized incidence ratio of 3.07 (95% confidence interval 1.26, 11.06). No increases in risk were observed in heavier or lighter weight infants. Because ascertainment and diagnostic changes do not explain the weight-specific increases in incidence, these results provide the first population-level evidence for a new epidemic.\r"

Control of labor was attempted with ritodrine in all patients with less than or equal to 5 cm cervical dilation. If control were obtained, betamethasone was given 30 minutes later. Significant differences were found between the 33 infants born after 24 hours of betamethasone and those delivered before in terms of survival 90.1% v 56.6% (P = .001), respiratory distress syndrome 27.2% v 73.6% (P = .0001), and need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation 42.4% v 81.1% (P = .0005). The average hospital stay for beta-treated infants was 82 days v 99 days for nontreated infants. The average exposure to O2 after betamethasone was 12.7 days v 20.2 days, (P = .01), although need for intermittent positive pressure ventilation was similar (23 days) in the two groups. In infants who survived greater than 48 hours, the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus in the beta-group was 18.8% (6/32) v 44.4% (16/36) in the nontreated group (P = .04). Our data suggest that in infants weighing less than 1,000 g, control of labor with ritodrine for a minimum of 24 hours and administration of betamethasone can reduce significantly not only the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome but also mortality and morbidity.\r"

This neonatal examination consisted of assessment of posture, extremity and axial tone, deep tendon reflexes, pathologic reflexes, primitive reflexes, symmetry, oromotor function, cranial nerve function, auditory and visual responses, and behavior. Premature infants whose neonatal neurodevelopmental examination results were abnormal had significantly higher incidences of both cerebral palsy (38% v 6%, P less than .000001) and minor neuromotor dysfunction (27% v 13%, p less than .05) than did premature infants whose examination results were normal. This correlation continued to be highly significant even with the analysis of subgroups (infants born at or before 27 weeks' gestation, infants with chronic lung disease discharged with oxygen supplementation, infants with periventricular hemorrhage) and when a variety of individual perinatal, demographic, and social variables were used as controls. Normal or nearly normal neonatal neurodevelopmental examination results can be used to reassure parents of high-risk premature infants. Although abnormal neonatal neurodevelopmental examination results cannot be used to diagnose handicap in premature infants, they can be used to select a group of high-risk infants who should be carefully monitored during infancy and childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Because inadequate assessment and inappropriate treatment of acute asthma have been implicated as contributing factors in morbidity and even deaths, the management of acute asthma, as practiced in an emergency room, were reviewed. The study population comprised 1,864 children (mean age 5.6 years; 65% boys) who attended the emergency room with acute asthma on 3,358 occasions during a 16-month period. Visits occurred more commonly in winter and usually in the evenings; 93% were self-referred and the mean duration of symptoms was 41 hours. Most acute episodes were associated with infection. Although chest auscultation, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded during the majority of visits, evidence that pulsus paradoxus had been measured could be found for only 1% of visits. Results of lung function and blood gas values were rarely recorded, but chest radiographs were obtained in 18% of visits. Drugs used in the emergency room included beta 2-agonists (93% of visits), theophylline (16%), and systemic steroids (4%), but no child received anticholinergic therapy. In 26% of patient visits, admission to hospital occurred; one patient died. The erratic fashion in which asthma severity appears to have been assessed and the failure to document whether lung function had been measured are causes for concern. The surprisingly high hospitalization rate may have been avoided if bronchodilators and corticosteroids had not been underused in the emergency room.\r"

Compared with the low-dose regimen, the high-dose regimen resulted in significantly greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, and wheeze score and a lower hospitalization rate. The changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, white blood cell count, and serum potassium concentration did not differ significantly between the groups. The incidence of side effects, which included tremor, hyperactivity, and vomiting, was not significantly different in the two populations. Serum albuterol levels varied widely, but there was no correlation between the levels and the increase in heart rate or other side effects. high-dose, frequently administered, nebulized albuterol appears both safe and effective in treating severe, acute asthma in children.\r"

The mothers were all Jewish, none were single, and none were social welfare dependents. Of these mothers, 72% were breast-feeding, 6% stated an intent to breast-feed, and 22% were formula-feeding their infants. A significantly increased rate of breast-feeding was found among mothers with the following characteristics: those of orthodox religious belief, high educational level, in the academic and paraacademic professions, nonsmokers, those who worked outside of the home during the pregnancy, those who had previous breast-feeding success, and mothers whose husbands' attitude toward breast-feeding was positive. The decision to breast-feed was made prior to delivery in 85% of mothers. Participation of the mother and/or father in antenatal preparation courses did not significantly influence the initiation of breast-feeding. Multivariant analysis with a stepwise logistic regression model delineated the four factors most significantly associated with the initiation of breast-feeding: positive spousal attitude toward breast-feeding, orthodox religious belief, nonsmoking, and work outside of the home during the pregnancy. The expected probability for initiating breast-feeding was computed for the various combinations of these four categories and ranged from .94 with all factors present to .33 in the absence of these characteristics.

Results indicated that the same proportion of mothers (55%) who were employed full-time as those not employed reported breast-feeding their infants in the hospital. Working full-time seemed to have a substantial impact on breast-feeding duration. Only 10% of full-time employed mothers breast-fed their infants at 6 months of age compared with 24% of those not employed. Analyses of breast-feeding by demographic characteristics indicated that in-hospital breast-feeding was relatively high among mothers who were not working outside the home and who were 30 years of age and older, in high family income groups, college educated, white, and living in the Mountain or Pacific region of the United States. Breast-feeding patterns among white and black mothers showed that a relatively high incidence of in-hospital breast-feeding was reported by black mothers who returned to work full time. Many more blacks than whites who were working full time were in those demographic subgroups that reported the highest incidence of breast-feeding: mothers who were 25 years of age and older, in high-income groups, and college educated. Ways to increase the level of breast-feeding among employed mothers are outlined.\r"

Participants were selected on the basis of anthropometric criteria, particularly a decline in weight velocity preceding changes in length gains. The investigation was designed as a double-blind, randomized, pair-matched, controlled study of dietary zinc supplementation of 6 months' duration. Anthropometric data were collected at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Twenty-five pairs of infants completed the project. When compared with placebo-treated control children, the zinc-supplemented group (combined sexes) and the supplemented boys showed significant improvements in standard deviation scores for weight for all three intervals, the largest differences occurring for the 0- to 3-month interval (P less than or equal to .0001). The zinc-supplemented girls demonstrated a trend toward improvements in changes in standard deviation scores for weight (P = .056). There were no differences in length gains for either boys or girls. This improvement in weight gains after zinc supplementation demonstrates that mild zinc deficiency can be one of the etiologic factors in nutritional failure to thrive during infancy.\r"

All children were developmentally delayed; 95% had speech delays. Short attention span with hyperactivity, temper tantrums, mouthing of objects persisting at an age beyond when it would be expected, autistic behaviors, and poor gross motor coordination were seen in 50% or more of the children. Mental retardation was present in the family history of 65%, and 90% had a family history of at least one of the following: mental retardation, learning disabilities, or hyperactivity. The most common physical findings were long and/or wide and/or protruding ears, prominent jaw and/or long face, high arched palate, and a flattened nasal bridge.

Three rings were expanding and developing into semicommercial enterprises, however and four or more men participated in them. Children acting as ringleaders recruited victims for the perpetrator in 22 rings, usually in exchange for money. The offenses reported included fondling and masturbation (30 rings), oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse (21 rings), and production of child pornography (two rings). In addition, two adolescent prostitution rings involving 12- to 18-year-old boys were investigated by the police.

In 63% of these children, unsuspected medical diagnoses were made by a combination of history, physical examination, and appropriate screening tests. When only those children previously examined by a physician in the United States were included in our analysis, the rate of unsuspected diagnosis remained high (67%). Omission of screening tests was the single most frequent cause of missed diagnoses, of which the majority were infectious diseases. More than 50% of our newly established diagnoses carried the potential for long-term sequelae without proper treatment. These data emphasize that internationally adopted children should receive a thorough screening evaluation for medical problems that may adversely affect their growth and development.\r"

The effects of maturation on the adolescent ECG were explored using sexual maturity rating (SMR) as a marker. ECGs were obtained from 751 patients 8 to 20 years of age seen for routine physical examinations. A total of 33 standard ECG measures were analyzed, with subjects separated by sex and SMR. Different trends were seen in boys and girls during the course of maturation for the majority of R and S wave amplitude measurements. Lower mean amplitudes were seen consistently in more mature (SMR 4 and 5) girls than less mature girls and all boys. The clinical implication of these findings is illustrated by analysis of the sum of RV5 and SV2, one of the criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy, by sex and SMR. No significant difference in the sum is noted for boys across five SMR groups. Girls, in contrast, show a steady decrease in the sum with advancing maturation. These trends are not as clearly shown when subjects are grouped by broad chronologic age ranges, as had been the practice in developing current adolescent ECG tables. These findings suggest that development of standard ECG tables in which SMR and sex have been taken into account might enhance interpretation during adolescence.\r"

  ".W": "As this paper has emphasized, regulation of the health professions does not exist in a vacuum. First, regulation of professions and occupations always depends on political circumstances for its inception and operation. Second, regulatory policy issues revolve on questions of value accorded competing issues. In a democracy, values are the province of the public, not of the experts. Nurses can aid the public in sorting out relevant values by taking a leadership role in regulatory initiatives. Third, certain characteristics--expertise, cohesiveness, political salience and leadership--are significant in advancing the policy agenda. The nursing profession must rethink its position on the policy agenda. Fourth, the regulatory pattern of the future outlines an essential role for government--government acting as our agent in accomplishing tasks of social control and social justice. As James Reagan has stated, \"Laws inevitably reflect the times in which they were written, expressing social objectives, scientific knowledge and technical capabilities of the era.\" We can extend that observation to rule making, modes of procedure and legislative patterns. None of these factors is static. Fifth, proposing regulatory initiatives is the cutting edge of practice. In the present social-political-technological environment, only one certainty exists for nursing professionals: The health care field will continue for some time in its present state of flux. Now as never before, nurses have the opportunity to demonstrate leadership, to influence public opinion about health care, and to play an important role in new regulations governing health care and the nursing profession.\r"

The growing complexity of our health care system demands that nurses assume increasing responsibility for ethical decision making. We can no longer ignore the link between ethics and nursing.

In small hospitals a higher level of integrative mechanism use was related to increased nurse innovation adoption; however, in large hospitals the opposite was found. Of the five categories of integrative mechanisms identified, only Research Conduct and Publication were significantly related to innovation adoption, and then only in small hospitals. In large hospitals, Conference and Presentation, Position and Committee, and Publication categories were demonstrated to be significantly, but negatively, related to innovation adoption among nurses.\r"

Because American universities are highly stratified organizations, several representative disciplines and an integrative model were used to examine interdisciplinary perceptions of reward criteria. Three hundred sixty six academicians with professional appointments in physics, psychology, sociology, nursing, and management were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire, the Tenure Decision Factor Inventory (TDFI) composed of Achievement (ACH) Ascriptive (ASCRIPT), Internal Political (IP), and External Political (EP) criteria related to tenure receipt. Significant main effects were shown by both discipline and reward criteria. Perceptions of nursing faculty distinguished nursing from the four other study disciplines. Although many factors influenced tenure decisions, the achievement criteria were identified by members of all disciplines as the most important determinants during tenure review.\r"

Pulmonary artery temperature served as the standard for core body temperature. Measurements in the rectum were recorded with a disposable plastic temperature probe and in the urinary bladder with a thermistor-tipped Foley catheter. Patients were studied within one hour of admission to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit and on an hourly basis until they reached normothermia (37 degrees C). Although mean temperatures did not vary greatly for any group, there was a significant difference between measures over time. Correlations of pulmonary artery and urinary bladder temperatures ranged from .78 to .94, pulmonary artery and rectal temperature from .49 to .82, and urinary bladder and rectal temperature from .46 to .85. The results of this study indicate that the urinary bladder is a reliable indicator of core temperature during rewarming following cardiac surgery.\r"

At least 95% of subjects reached temperature stabilization at all sites by 5 1/2 minutes. Mean difference between axillary and inguinal readings was 0.6 degrees F; between rectal and inguinal readings, 0.8 degrees F; and between rectal and axillary 0.2 degrees F. Although the greatest difference between mean temperature readings was found between the rectal and inguinal sites (0.8 degrees F), this pair of readings also had the highest correlation. This finding indicates that inguinal site temperatures are more reflective of rectal temperatures and may be less sensitive to effects of brown adipose tissue heat generation.\r"

Based on a critique of a study of positive health practices among adults (Muhlenkamp & Sayles, 1986), a causal model of positive health practices for adolescents was developed a priori from a theoretical formulation. Using data from a sample of 165 adolescents who responded to the Personal Lifestyle Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Part 2 of the Personal Resource Questionnaire which measures a social support system, and a demographic data sheet, the intercorrelations among the study variables were analyzed using correlation coefficients. The causal model was then tested with the adolescent data using the LISREL VI program. The results showed a relatively good fit of the model to the data via a number of indicators. The model was then applied to data published from adults (Muhlenkamp & Sayles) using the LISREL VI program. The results indicated that there was a relatively poor fit of the model to the adult data, thus demonstrating the problem of replicating causal models with varied samples when the correct approach to causal modeling is used. The discussion focuses on theoretical and methodological reasons for the findings.\r"

Findings from 20 in-depth, face-to-face interviews conducted with a purposive sample of family caregivers in their homes revealed that much of the caregiving experience consists of coping with negative choices wherein all possible alternatives are undesirable. The three stages of Surviving on the Brink, (1) Taking it on, (2) Going through it, and (3) Turning it over, capture the variation in behavior. Continued validation of this process of coping and decision making offers promise for substantive theory development on which nursing intervention programs for easing caregiver burdens might be based.\r"

Four psychological variables (importance of health, perceived health locus of control, health status, and self-efficacy), one modifying variable (selected demographics), and certain health-promoting behaviors were examined. Pearson product moment correlations and stepwise and hierarchical multiple regression techniques were used to analyze the data. Each of the psychological variables examined was predictive of health-promotive behaviors. Health status and self-efficacy were the most powerful predictors. The modifer role of demographics was also supported. The results suggest the health promotion model is potentially useful for explaining the occurrence of health-promotive behaviors among blue-collar workers.\r"

With the proper pain-management strategy, however, pain can be controlled in most patients. The analgesic ladder for pain control, promoted by the World Health Organization, begins with a nonnarcotic agent, progresses to a weak narcotic plus a nonnarcotic, and finally reaches a strong narcotic. Adjuvant agents, which increase the analgesic potency of the drug being used, may be added at any level. The most common reasons for inadequate pain control in cancer patients are incorrect narcotic dosing and incorrect switching from one narcotic to another and from one route of administration to another. Factors that influence pain management (eg, fear, anxiety, sleep disturbance) should be treated as well with appropriate medications, behavioral therapy, counseling, hypnosis, and other supportive techniques. These points are illustrated in the case report (see box, page 328).\r"

If a patient steadfastly refuses to admit that he or she has a problem with alcohol or other drugs, the physician should continue to care for the patient and to help his or her family members find a recovery program for themselves.\r"

Similar Zn2+ and imidazole catalysis of cyclization/cleavage is seen with the dinucleotide 3',5'-UpU (uridylyluridine). Again, the zinc system is much more effective than is catalysis by imidazole alone, and in this case simultaneous Lewis acid/base catalysis substitutes for the sequential proton acid/base catalysis seen with polynucleotides or dinucleotides and imidazole buffer catalysts. A mechanism is proposed for catalysis of RNA cleavage by the enzyme ribonuclease A, and the relationship of that mechanism to the action of the enzyme model systems is discussed.\r"

Phosphorylation of a synthetic random polymer of arginine and serine (3:1) is only moderately enhanced by Ca2+ and lipids, but it is greatly enhanced in the absence of Ca2+ and lipids by a contaminant in crystalline bovine serum albumin or by heated cellular fractions. The phosphorylation ratio of histone to poly(arginine,serine) varies between different PK-C fractions from brains of rat, pig, or lamb. These variations are partly caused by a PK-C isozyme that prefers poly(arginine,serine) over histone as substrate. The kinase activator (KA) was partly purified from bovine serum albumin and from extracts of plasma membranes of human placenta. KA is also present in mitochondria, nuclei, and the cytosol. Sulfates and phosphates at 10 mM substitute for KA with poly(arginine,serine) as substrate. The phosphorylation of histone III in the presence of Ca2+ and lipids is moderately stimulated by KA, but the phosphorylation of lamin B and some other endogenous proteins is greatly enhanced by KA. With histones as substrates, inorganic anions do not stimulate phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of poly-(arginine,serine) is very sensitive to low concentrations of staurosporin and is inhibited by PK-C antibody, but, in contrast to histone phosphorylation, it is resistant to sphingosine and polymyxin B. The poly(arginine,serine) phosphorylating activity is more stable at 4 degrees C than the histone phosphorylating activity, but the latter is stabilized by 0.05% Triton X-100.\r"

These transport activities are organelle and substrate specific and are characterized by apparent Km for nucleotide derivatives in the low micromolar range. As part of our goal of purifying and characterizing the above transport proteins, we have reconstituted a protein extract from rat liver Golgi membranes into phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The resulting proteoliposomes transport CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-AcNeu) and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate with very similar affinity and inhibition characteristics as intact Golgi vesicles. Sialic acid and sodium sulfate, which are transported only very slowly into the lumen of Golgi vesicles, are transported at low rates by the reconstituted proteoliposomes. Neither rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles nor proteoliposomes made from proteins of the rough endoplasmic reticulum transport CMP-AcNeu. The above results demonstrate that this reconstituted system can be used for further purification and characterization of nucleotide sugar and nucleotide sulfate translocator proteins. This approach should also be useful to study membrane transport proteins of lysosomes and endosomes.\r"

We show that, upon addition of hemin (an efficient iron donor) to the cell culture, the rate of ferritin biosynthesis reaches a maximum after a few hours and then decreases. During a 24-hr incubation with the iron donor the concentrations of total ferritin heavy (H) and light (L) subunit mRNAs rise 2- to 5-fold and 2- to 3-fold, respectively, over the control values, while the amount of the protein increases 10- to 30-fold. The hemin-induced increment in ferritin subunit mRNA is not prevented by deferoxamine, suggesting that it is not directly mediated by chelatable iron. In vitro nuclear transcription analyses performed on nuclei isolated from control cells and cells grown in the presence of hemin indicate that the rates of synthesis of H- and L-subunit mRNAs remain constant. We conclude that iron-induced ferritin biosynthesis is governed by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We propose that exposure of cells to iron leads to stabilization of ferritin mRNAs, in addition to activation and translation of stored H- and L-subunit mRNAs.\r"

An evaluation of the chromatographic behavior of selected model proteins--thioredoxin, ubiquitin, calmodulin, lysozyme, cytochrome c, and myoglobin on immobilized transition metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+)--allows establishment of the following facets of the histidyl side chain distribution: (i) either interior or surface; (ii) when localized on the surface, accessible or unaccessible for coordination; (iii) single or multiple; (iv) when multiple, either distant or vicinal. Moreover, proteins displaying single histidyl side chains on their surfaces may, in some instances, be resolved by IMAC; apparently, the microenvironments of histidyl residues are sufficiently diverse to result in different affinities for the immobilized metal ions. IMAC, previously introduced as an approach to the fractionation of proteins, has become also, upon closer examination, a facile probe into the topography of histidyl residues. This is possible because of the inherent versatility of IMAC; an appropriate metal ion (M2+) can be selected to suit the analytical purpose and a particular chromatographic protocol can be applied (isocratic pH, falling pH, and imidazole elution).\r"

Although our goal was to deduce the structural features of the static bending of the helical axis exhibited by adenine-tract structures in solution, we conclude that the overall bend of 20 degrees in the direction of the major groove observed here arises from the forces associated with crystal packing. An isomorphous dodecamer brominated on one strand provides experimental evidence that this asymmetric sequence is positioned in two orientations in the crystal lattice that are related by a 180 degrees rotation around the pseudodyad axis of the sequence. The bend in these two differently positioned DNA molecules depends on their orientation in the crystal, not on their sequence. As with previously determined structures containing adenine tracts, the adenine and thymine base pairs are highly propeller twisted. The N-6 of the adenine comes within hydrogen bonding distance of the O-4 of thymine one step down the helix, facilitating the formation of a series of bifurcated hydrogen bonds within the adenine tract. The adenine tract is relatively straight and the bending is localized outside this region.\r"

Photoemission from proteins and lipids is much less but also is increased by exposure to cesium. The formation of photocathodes with cesium greatly increases the practical magnifications attainable in photoelectron microscopy of organic and biological specimens. Photoelectron micrographs taken at magnifications greater than or equal to X 100,000 of chlorophyll-rich thylakoid membranes and of colloidal gold-labeled cytoskeleton preparations of cultured epithelial cells demonstrate the improvement in magnification. The selectivity and stability of the photocathodes suggest the possibility of detecting chromophore binding proteins in membranes and the design of photoelectron labels for tagging specific sites on biological surfaces.\r"

This sequence suggests that a form of bFGF of at least 163 amino acids exists. The hepatoma cDNA was transcribed in vitro into RNA; in vitro translation of this RNA generated three forms of bFGF with molecular masses of 18, 21, and 22.5 kDa. By use of in vitro mutagenesis, it was found that the 22.5-kDa bFGF and possibly the 21-kDa form were initiated with CUG start codons. The 18-kDa bFGF was initiated with an AUG codon. By transfecting into COS cells human hepatoma bFGF cDNA and a construct from which the AUG initiator was eliminated, it was found that the higher molecular mass forms of bFGF were as biologically active as the 18-kDa form.\r"

Characterization by peptide sequencing, amino acid composition, and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the N-terminal residue from the large subunit of the enzyme from each plant species was acetylated proline. The sequence of the penultimate N-terminal tryptic peptide from the large subunit of the spinach and wheat enzyme was consistent with previous primary structure determinations. However, the penultimate N-terminal peptide from the large subunit of both the tobacco and muskmelon enzymes, while identical, differed from the corresponding peptide from spinach and wheat by containing a trimethyllysyl residue at position 14. Thus, tryptic proteolysis occurred at lysine-18 rather than lysine-14 as with the spinach and wheat enzymes. A comparison of the DNA sequences for the large subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase indicates that the N terminus has been post-translationally processed by removal of methionine-1 and serine-2 followed by acetylation of proline-3. In addition, for the enzyme from tobacco and muskmelon a third post-translational modification occurs at lysine-14 in the form of N epsilon-trimethylation.\r"

We show that these cells produce transformed foci spontaneously if kept in the confluent state for more than 10 days. The formation of foci depends on the type and concentration of bovine serum used in the medium and passage history of the cells. Cells maintained in continuous exponential multiplication in the subconfluent state by transfer every 2-3 days in medium with 10% calf serum failed to develop the capacity to produce foci in 2% calf serum, but those transferred the same way in 2% calf serum or in 10% fetal bovine serum, which is a less potent growth stimulant, did develop that capacity to an increasing degree over time. The number of transformed cells increased sharply with the time that a culture remained in the confluent state. There are several morphological types and degrees of transformation, which indicates that the underlying changes are varied and the process is progressive. The results also suggest that transformation occurs in a fraction of an entire cell population that is undergoing a physiological adaptation to moderate constraints on its growth.\r"

In proliferating cells, these genes are transcribed throughout the cell cycle, and both the more distal site I and the proximal site II are occupied by promoter-binding factors. In this report we demonstrate that during the shutdown of proliferation and onset of differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 into cells that exhibit phenotypic properties of monocytes, histone gene expression is down-regulated at the level of transcription. In vivo occupancy of site I by promoter factors persists in the differentiated HL-60 cells, but protein-DNA interactions at site II are selectively lost. Furthermore, in vitro binding activity of the site II promoter factor HiNF-D is lost in differentiated cells, and nuclear extracts from differentiated cells do not support in vitro transcription of these histone genes. Our results suggest that the interaction of HiNF-D with proximal promoter site II sequences plays a primary role in rendering cell growth-regulated histone genes transcribable in proliferating cells. It appears that while cell-cycle control of histone gene expression is mediated by both transcription and mRNA stability, with the shutdown of proliferation and onset mRNA stability, with the shutdown of proliferation and onset of differentiation, histone gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level.\r"

Free Ca2+ measurements with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 and digital imaging reveal an inhomogeneous distribution of free cytoplasmic Ca2+ in both cell lines. Fura-2 also reveals a difference in free Ca2+ activity between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. Ion microscopic observations on sister cells show that total Ca in the cytoplasm is also inhomogeneously distributed and that mean cytoplasmic levels of total Ca are higher than levels in the nuclei. In the nuclei of NIH 3T3 cells, the mean free [Ca2+] and total [Ca] were 110 +/- 30 nM and 225 +/- 43 microM, respectively, while regions in the cell cytoplasm contained up to 490 +/- 270 nM free [Ca2+] and 559 +/- 184 microM mean total [Ca]. Intracellular total Ca was greater than 3 orders of magnitude higher than intracellular free Ca2+ in either nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments. Perinuclear cytoplasmic regions in 3T3 cells contained higher free and total Ca than the cell nucleus. Loading of cells with fura-2 did not modify the subcellular distribution of total K, Na, Ca, or Mg. This combination of two powerful ion imaging techniques provides a comparison between free and total calcium in cells and introduces a different approach for examining the role of this important element in cell physiology.\r"

  ".U": "89184533\r", 
  ".W": "Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a small (12 kDa) acute-phase apoprotein of high density lipoprotein found in mammals. It is also the precursor to amyloid protein A, the main protein constituent of fibrils found in amyloidosis secondary to chronic or recurrent inflammation--e.g., rheumatoid arthritis. However, rats do not develop amyloidosis and SAA is not an apoprotein of rat high density lipoprotein; thus rats appear to be an exception in regard to expression of SAA genes. We report here that rats do have representatives of the SAA gene family and express two distinct SAA mRNAs. Moreover, the pattern of genes expressed among tissues, and their induction by inflammatory agents, is similar to that of related mouse genes. RNA from various tissues of normal and injured rats was examined by RNA blot hybridization with SAA cDNA and complementary RNA probes for the three murine SAA genes. A SAA mRNA of approximately 400 nucleotides related to mouse SAA1 and SAA2 mRNAs reached a high level in liver 24 hr after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. No extra-hepatic tissues were found to express the SAA1/SAA2-related mRNA. Turpentine induced two hepatic SAA1/SAA2-related mRNAs of approximately 400 and approximately 500 nucleotides in length. Liver SAA1/SAA2-related mRNA hybrid selected and translated in a wheat germ protein-synthesizing system, from lipopolysaccharide- and turpentine-injected rats, produced a single protein with an estimated molecular mass of 8 kDa. This rat liver SAA-related mRNA appears to lack a highly conserved coding region for portions of two amphipathic helical domains and the joining sequence. An mRNA related to mouse SAA3 was found expressed at a high level in lung after lipopolysaccharide but not following turpentine injection. This mRNA was also expressed at high levels in ileum and large intestine of control rats and was not found in the liver of control or challenged rats. These observations show that the SAA gene family is present and expressed in rats and that its expression is found under situations similar to those found in mice. This lends support for the importance of the SAA gene family in the response to injury by vertebrates.\r"

We have examined the extent to which this loss of competence depends on intercellular interactions, cell division, or protein synthesis. We find that ectoderm, when separated from a whole embryo as soon as the early blastula stage, and even when dissociated into its component cells, loses its competence at the normal time. When cell division was arrested by culturing isolated cells in solid medium, the time of competence loss was unaffected. To test whether protein synthesis is required for competence loss, ectoderm was treated with cycloheximide during the normal time that competence is lost; in some cases, this treatment had no effect and in others it prolonged competence, but only slightly. We conclude that the loss of mesodermal competence is a highly autonomous process in ectodermal cells, taking place in the absence of cell communication or cell division.\r"

The mutations leading to the disease are heterogeneous and frequently arise as de novo events. We have identified nucleotide alterations in 15 independently arising HPRT-deficiency cases by direct DNA sequencing of in vitro amplified HPRT cDNA. We also demonstrate that the direct DNA sequence analysis can be automated, further simplifying the detection of new mutations at this locus. The mutations include DNA base substitutions, small DNA deletions, a single DNA base insertion, and errors in RNA splicing. The application of these procedures allows DNA diagnosis and carrier identification by the direct detection of the mutant alleles within individual families affected by LN.\r"

Autoantibodies were produced to brain only; various other tissues tested were negative. These antibodies were not elicited by other influenza A or B viruses, including closely related recombinant strains, but were elicited by the isolated hemagglutinin of A/Bellamy/42 strain and by formaldehyde-fixed WSN virus--demonstrating that infection was not essential for the induction of autoantibodies. In histological studies, reaction with anti-viral antisera was specific to gray matter and was confined to sera that recognized the 37-kDa protein. Antibody binding was prominent in regions comprised of neuronal cell bodies in cellular layers of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum and was undetectable in myelin-rich regions, such as the corpus callosum. The 37-kDa protein, therefore, appears to be a neuronal antigen. Antibodies directed against this protein may be involved in the pathogenesis of one or more of the neuropsychiatric disorders that occur after infection with influenza.\r"

We have recently developed a native-state, three-dimensional, gel-supported primary culture system that allows every type of human cancer to grow in vitro at more than 90% frequency, with maintenance of tissue architecture, tumor-stromal interaction, and differentiated functions. Here we demonstrate that the native-state culture system allows proliferation indices to be determined for all solid cancer types explanted directly from surgery into long-term culture. Normal tissues also proliferate readily in this system. The degree of resolution of measurement of cell proliferation by histological autoradiography within the cultured tissues is greatly enhanced with the use of epi-illumination polarization microscopy. The histological status of the cultured tissues can be assessed simultaneously with the proliferation status. Carcinomas generally have areas of high epithelial proliferation with quiescent stromal cells. Sarcomas have high proliferation of cells of mesenchymal organ. Normal tissues can also proliferate at high rates. An image analysis system has been developed to automate proliferation determination. The high-resolution physiological means described here to measure the proliferation capacity of tissues will be important in further understanding of the deregulation of cell proliferation in cancer as well as in cancer prognosis and treatment.\r"

The leukemic cells have a translocation between chromosomes 1 and 14, t(1;14)(p33;q11), which we have molecularly cloned and sequenced. Initial screening used joining (J)-segment probes from the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha- and delta-chain loci. In apparent concert with the translocation, a deletion has occurred between delta-chain diversity (D)-region genes D delta 1 and D delta 2. D delta 2 was observed on derivative chromosome 1 [der(1)] and D delta 1 on der(14) with a deletion of the intervening 10 kilobases of germ-line DNA. The nature of the D delta 1-D delta 2 deletional event implicates a lymphoid recombinase in the mechanism of the translocation. As a consequence of the translocation, an unusual fusion transcript was generated. Probes from chromosome 1 detected a previously unreported transcript in RNA from both the cell line and the patient. A chromosome 14 probe identified the same transcript, thus confirming a fusion transcript derived from both chromosomes 1 and 14. This translocation may identify a gene for which we propose the name SCL (stem-cell leukemia) that is important for hemopoietic development and oncogenesis and that has been disrupted or altered in this stem-cell line.\r"

The antitumor activity of encapsulated doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin) was compared with that of the free drug in a murine hepatic and pulmonary tumor model. This was obtained by intrasplenic injection of L1210 lymphoma cells followed by splenectomy. Different schedules of treatment of tumor-bearing mice with erythrocyte-encapsulated or free doxorubicin were investigated. The optimal schedule of treatment for free doxorubicin proved to be i.v. bolus administration on the day of splenectomy. Under these conditions, the dose producing 50% inhibition of metastatic growth in the liver, as measured by inhibition of 5-[125I]iodo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake 9 days after tumor induction, was 6.3 mg/kg for free doxorubicin and 0.48 mg/kg for the encapsulated drug. In these conditions pulmonary tumor development was even more efficiently prevented by encapsulated doxorubicin as compared with the free drug. The values of the therapeutic index (TI), defined as the ratio between the maximal tolerated dose (LD10) and the minimal effective dose (ED90, producing 90% inhibition of liver metastatic growth), were 4.2 and 1.8 for encapsulated and free doxorubicin, respectively.\r"

Following unilateral decortication of rats, GM1 (5 mg/kg per day) administered intracerebroventricularly could protect forebrain cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis from retrograde degeneration in a manner comparable to beta-NGF. Administered in combination with beta-NGF, GM1 produced a significant increase in choline acetyltransferase activity in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and remaining cortex ipsilateral to the lesion. Concentrations of GM1 that were ineffective when administered alone in this lesion model, when given with beta-NGF, potentiated beta-NGF effects in both of the above brain areas. In dissociated septal cells in vitro, an increase in choline acetyltransferase activity was noted at beta-NGF concentrations as low as 0.1 pM and reached a plateau at 1 nM. A moderate (up to 35%) stimulation of choline acetyltransferase activity was observed with 10 microM GM1. The application of beta-NGF in combination with 10 microM GM1 or 0.1 microM GM1, a concentration that is ineffective in these cultures, produced a much greater increase in choline acetyltransferase activity than did beta-NGF alone. These observations support the idea that exogenously applied gangliosides can elicit trophic responses in cholinergic neurons of the central nervous system. That GM1 increases and even potentiates beta-NGF effects suggests that some of the trophic actions of this compound may be mediated through endogenous trophic factors.\r"

  ".W": "In adult cats, retinal ganglion cells of the beta class project almost exclusively to the lateral geniculate nucleus rather than to the superior colliculus (SC). We have examined whether this target specificity is present during early development. To identify ganglion cells that send axons to the SC in development, rhodamine-labeled microspheres were deposited in the SC at embryonic day (E) 38, E43, or postnatal day (P) 4. Retinae were then removed between E56 and P32 and kept alive in a tissue-slice chamber so that ganglion cells that had been retrogradely labeled with microspheres could be injected intracellularly with Lucifer yellow to reveal their morphological class. Many beta cells could be retrogradely labeled by microspheres injected into the SC at E38 or E43. They were indistinguishable from beta cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus and were found even when a single injection was restricted to the caudal portion of the SC. In contrast, beta cells could not be retrogradely labeled by microspheres injected into the SC at P4. The disappearance of a beta-cell projection to the SC cannot be explained entirely by cell death since as late as P32, well after the major period of ganglion cell death, many beta ganglion cells labeled with microspheres at E38 were still present. These observations suggest that many beta cells initially extend an axon collateral to the SC that is subsequently lost some time after E43. Thus, to achieve the remarkable specificity present in the adult visual system, beta cells must withdraw axon collaterals from an entire target nucleus. Similar collateral elimination may give rise to the specificity of afferent connections in other sensory systems.\r"

In this report we describe the cellular distribution of 1B236/MAG mRNA transcripts in rat brain by using in situ hybridization. At postnatal day 20, large numbers of 1B236/MAG mRNA-containing oligodendrocytes are concentrated in myelinated fiber tracts and throughout gray matter regions. The presence of high levels of 1B236/MAG mRNA within oligodendrocytes at postnatal day 20 is consistent with the proposed role of MAG in formation of the myelin sheath during development. In the adult brain, our results suggest that not only is 1B236/MAG mRNA expressed at reduced levels within oligodendrocytes but also 1B236/MAG or a 1B236/MAG-like mRNA is present within neurons. This localization is consistent with the results of previous immunocytochemical studies using antibodies against the 1B236/MAG mRNA with different cell-type-specific patterns of expression suggests that oligodendrocytes and neurons employ different mechanisms for regulating the same gene. Thus, different cell types may use a similar cell adhesion molecule both during myelinogenesis and in the mature nervous system.\r"

  ".U": "89184576\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the effect of diabetes on the development of axonal degeneration after acute nerve compression, the mobilized peroneal nerves of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and of control rats were compressed at 150 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133 Pa) for 30 min by using specially devised cuffs. At three intervals after compression--3 days, rats diabetic for 31 wk; 14 days, diabetic for 6 wk; and 24 days, diabetic for 31 wk--groups of nerves were studied to assess numbers and sizes of fibers above, at, and below the cuff and to assess frequency of fiber degeneration in teased fibers from nerve distal to the cuff. Teased fibers with pathologic abnormalities were more frequent in nerves from controls than in nerves from diabetic rats in all three groups but the difference was statistically significant only at 3 and 14 days after compression. The lack of significant difference at 24 days may be explained by higher rates of disappearance of degenerating products and of fiber regeneration at 24 than at 3 and 14 days. This study provides evidence that in addition to delaying the reported functional deficit of vibratory detection threshold and conduction block during nerve compression, diabetes also may partially prevent axonal injury. Low nerve myo-inositol concentration did not predispose diabetic nerve to acute compression injury. If these results also apply to human diabetes and if repeated acute compression is involved in the genesis of fiber degeneration in entrapment, then a higher frequency of entrapment neuropathy among diabetics might be due to mechanisms other than increased susceptibility of fibers to acute compression--e.g., possibly to greater constriction of nerve due to pathologic alterations of the carpal ligament.\r"

  ".W": "It has long been recognized that the renal proximal tubular epithelium of the hamster is a bona fide estrogen target tissue. The effect of estrogens on the growth of proximal tubule cell explants and dissociated single cells derived from these explant outgrowths has been studied in culture. Renal tubular cells were grown on a PF-HR-9 basement membrane under serum-free chemically defined culture conditions. The cells of tissue explant outgrowths exhibited ultrastructural features typical of proximal tubules including junctional complexes, numerous mitochondria, peroxisomes, and microvilli. At 7-14 days in culture, cell number was enhanced 3-fold in the presence of either 17 beta-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol. Maximal proliferative response was observed at hormone concentrations of 0.6-1 nM. A similar 3-fold increase in cell number was also seen at 1 nM 17 beta-estradiol in subcultured dissociated single tubular cells derived from hamster renal tubular explant outgrowths at 21 days in culture. Neither progesterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, nor the inactive diethylstilbestrol metabolite beta-dienestrol elicited this mitogenic effect. Concomitant exposure of tamoxifen at 3-fold molar excess in culture completely abolished the increase in cell number seen with 17 beta-estradiol. Tubular cells obtained from hamster medulla did not exhibit this proliferative response when exposed similarly to 17 beta-estradiol or diethylstilbestrol. The proliferative effect of estrogens on proximal tubular cell growth appears to be species specific since 17 beta-estradiol did not alter the growth of either rat or guinea pig proximal tubules in culture. In addition, at 7-10 days in culture in the presence of 17 beta-estradiol, [3H]thymidine labeling of hamster tubular cells was enhanced 3-fold. A similar increase in mitoses was also observed in cultures containing these potent estrogens during the same time interval of estrogen exposure. These results clearly indicate that estrogens can directly induce primary epithelial cell proliferation at physiologic concentrations and provide strong additional evidence for an important hormonal role in the neoplastic transformation of the hamster kidney.\r"

This protein has also been reported to transactivate viral late gene expression, independently of replication. In this study I have used a vector that permits simultaneously a precise quantitation of simian virus 40 early and late promoter activity with a single nuclease S1 mapping probe. The results show that T antigen can activate the early promoter as well as the late promoter and that only on replicating templates does a shift occur in the ratio of late-to-early transcription. This simultaneous transactivation of early and late promoters occurs in human (HeLa) and monkey (CV-1) cells but does not occur in mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. It is seen with either wild-type T antigen or with a T antigen protein that carries a mutation in the nuclear localization signal. The mutant protein cannot bring about an early-to-late shift, consistent with its inability to support viral replication.\r"

The purified, crosslinked protein was digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and a resultant peptide, purified from polyacrylamide slab gel slices, was shown to have the amino acid sequence Val-Ser-Ala-Pro-Phe-Asp-Leu-Glu-Ala-Pro-Phe-Ile-Ile-Asp-Gly-Ile. Polyclonal antiserum, generated against a synthetic peptide that corresponded to the above sequence, immunoprecipitated the radiolabeled crosslinked protein and reacted with a Mr 77,000 protein on immunoblots, demonstrating that the sequenced peptide originated from the apparent receptor. A clone containing a 2.5-kilobase insert was subsequently isolated from a sea urchin testis cDNA library that contained DNA sequences encoding an open reading frame of 532 amino acids that included the above peptide sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests that the protein contains a 26-residue amino-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular domain relatively rich in cysteine (5%) that includes a four-fold repeat of about 115 amino acids, a single membrane-spanning region, and only 12 amino acid residues extending into the cytoplasm. Analysis of total RNA from Strongylocentrotus purpuratus testis by Northern blot revealed a 2.5-kilobase RNA. Preliminary data show the presence of hybridizing RNA of the same apparent size in other sea urchin species, including Arbacia punctulata, which does not respond to speract.\r"

The initial phases of transformation involve the processing of the T-DNA in the bacterial cell after induction of the vir genes located on the Ti plasmid. The kinetics and conditions of this processing were examined and upon induction with acetosyringone up to 40% of the left and right borders of the T-DNA were cleaved. This cleavage was dependent upon virA, virG, and VirD and was rec-independent. Processed T-DNA was observed within 30 min after induction and was delayed by an increased concentration of phosphate in the induction medium. When DNA was isolated in the absence of protease treatment, the DNA fragment corresponding to the left side of the cut at both the left and right border region exhibited gel retardation, suggesting one or more \"pilot\" proteins may be involved in T-DNA transfer. Although the relative abundance of a processed product does not necessarily imply relative importance, the preponderance of double-stranded cleavage products suggests that double-stranded T-DNA should be considered as a possible intermediate in T-DNA transfer.\r"

Protein 2A was expressed from a plasmid construct (pHIV/2A) incorporating the HIV long terminal repeat. Protein synthesis was measured by using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a reporter gene driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. When HIV/2A was cotransfected with the reporter, addition of a tat-producing plasmid caused at least a 50-fold drop in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis. A HeLa cell line carrying HIV/2A was established. In it, tat expression caused more than a 10-fold drop in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase synthesis from the reporter plasmid. Furthermore, 2A induction by tat caused cleavage of the cellular translation factor P220, a part of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F. Thus protein 2A can, by itself, carry out the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis characteristic of a poliovirus infection. Also, the HIV tat activation provides a very effective method to control gene expression in mammalian cells.\r"

The 43-kDa affinity-purified protein protects the region from position -59 to position -35 of the somatostatin promoter from DNase I digestion. This region of the somatostatin promoter harbors the TGACGTCA motif, also found and required for function in a number of other cAMP-responsive and adenovirus E1A-inducible promoters. Efficient and authentic transcription in vitro directed from the somatostatin promoter requires the TGACGTCA promoter element. In vitro transcription assays performed in the presence of somatostatin (positions -60 to -29), enkephalin (positions -105 to -71), and adenovirus type 5 E3 gene (positions -72 to -42) competitor fragments, harboring similar TGACGTCA motifs, selectively inhibit transcription directed from the somatostatin promoter, suggesting that the TGACGTCA element is the site of interaction of a somatostatin gene transactivator. Furthermore, extracts depleted of the TGACGTCA-binding activities by affinity chromatography utilizing a biotinylated oligonucleotide-avidin resin, are incapable of directing transcription from the somatostatin but not from the adenovirus major late promoter. Addition of the purified 43-kDa protein to the affinity-depleted extract restores transcription from the somatostatin promoter. These results are consistent with the 43-kDa protein being a trans-activator of the somatostatin gene.\r"

Well-resolved major and minor resonances in a ratio of 3:1 are observed throughout the 1H NMR spectrum. Two-dimensional exchange experiments show that the major and minor species are related by an equilibrium process. Analysis of short proton-proton distances along the peptide backbone, identified by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, provides unambiguous evidence that the two forms of the folded protein differ only in the isomerization state of the peptide bond between Gly-42 and Pro-43. Cis-trans isomerism of Pro-43 is thereby directly identified as the cause of multiple conformations for the folded protein in solution. In addition, when Pro-43 is mutated to a glycine residue there is no indication of multiple conformations. These results provide evidence for the possibility of conformational heterogeneity in the native state of globular proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are potent mitogenic polypeptides which enhance rates of wound healing in experimental animals; in contrast, glucocorticoids inhibit wound repair. The potential of TGF-beta and PDGF to reverse this inhibition in healing was tested in methylprednisolone-treated rats with deficits in skin wound strength of 50%. Single applications of TGF-beta (10-40 pmol per wound, 0.25-1 micrograms) applied locally at the time of wounding fully reversed this deficit in a concentration-dependent and highly reproducible manner. Wounds in glucocorticoid-treated animals were characterized by a near total absence of neutrophils and macrophages and by a delayed influx and reduced density of fibroblasts; however, such wounds treated with TGF-beta showed significant increases in wound fibroblasts and in intracellular procollagen type I. PDGF did not reverse the deficit in wound breaking strength in glucocorticoid-treated rats; there were more fibroblasts in the PDGF-treated wounds, but these fibroblasts lacked the enhanced expression of procollagen type I found in TGF-beta-treated wounds. The wound macrophages, required for normal tissue repair, remained absent from both PDGF- and TGF-beta-treated wounds in glucocorticoid-treated animals. This result suggested that macrophages might normally act as an intermediate in the induction of procollagen synthesis in fibroblasts of PDGF-treated wounds and that TGF-beta might bypass the macrophage through its capacity to stimulate directly new synthesis of procollagen type I in fibroblasts. Whereas PDGF does not stimulate procollagen synthesis, in a rodent macrophage cell line, PDGF induced a highly significant, time-dependent enhancement of expression of TGF-beta.\r"

(i) Two peptides that inhibit the binding of fibrinogen and other ligands to gpIIb-IIIa, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val, also inhibited the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of this subset of proteins. The tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser, which does not inhibit fibrinogen binding, did not inhibit thrombin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. (ii) Platelets lacking gpIIb-IIIa (from a subject with Glanzmann thrombasthenia) did not undergo this subset of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to thrombin, although other serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylations proceeded normally.

The cells were cultured on microcarrier beads and superfused with an oxygenated medium--thereby permitting dense suspensions of viable cells to be maintained in the NMR probe for extended time periods. Under these conditions, distinct 31P signals could be seen for ATP within the vesicular and the cytosolic pools. Comparison of the integrated areas of the beta-phosphate resonances from the two ATP pools indicated 77% of the endogenous ATP was in the vesicular pool. From this observation and the assumption that the concentration of ATP in the vesicle is 87.5 mM, the concentration of ATP calculated to be in the cytoplasmic pool was approximately 4 mM. The pH in the vesicle determined from the chemical shift of the gamma-phosphate resonance of vesicular ATP was 5.84 +/- 0.17 (n = 6), slightly higher than the intragranular pH measured in hypoxic cells (5.57 +/- 0.15, n = 8). Spin-lattice relaxation times of ATP 31P resonances in the vesicular pool were from 12 to 14 times shorter than the ATP resonances in the cytosol, corresponding to a decrease in molecular mobility due to incorporation of ATP within a catecholamine-storage complex.\r"

This mRNA accumulates for at least 18 hr. Two protein kinase C activators, 1,2-dioctanoyl glycerol and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, suppress, whereas the calcium ionophore ionomycin enhances, the IFN-alpha/beta-induced expression of 2',5'-OAS mRNA. The 8-bromo and dibutyryl analogs of cAMP and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin did not affect the induction of 2',5'-OAS mRNA by IFN-alpha/beta. In the absence of IFN-alpha/beta, the above agents used either singly or in combinations, did not induce 2',5'-OAS mRNA expression nor did platelet-derived growth factor (1-2 units/ml), fibroblast growth factor (6-100 ng/ml), or bovine serum (10-20%). Bovine serum also did not affect 2',5'-OAS mRNA induction by IFN-alpha/beta. The poly(ADP)-ribose synthetase inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide suppressed IFN-alpha/beta-induced 2',5'-OAS gene expression. These results suggest that in quiescent BALB/c 3T3 cells (i) the 2',5'-OAS gene is not responsive to the three major signal transduction pathways activated by diacylglycerol, Ca2+, and cAMP; (ii) induction of the 2',5'-OAS gene by IFN-alpha/beta is decreased by activation of the protein kinase C pathway but enhanced by elevation of intracellular [Ca2+].\r"

We have now studied the effect of protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of this protein on its association with membranes in isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) from rat cerebral cortex. Incubation of synaptosomal membranes under conditions associated with activation of protein kinase C led to the release of the phosphorylated 87-kDa protein into the incubation medium. In intact synaptosomes, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters or by depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx caused an increased phosphorylation of the 87-kDa protein and its translocation from membrane to cytosol. This translocation showed time courses, calcium dependency, and reversibility similar to those observed for the protein kinase C-induced phosphorylation of the protein. These results suggest that protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation of the 87-kDa protein is responsible for its subcellular translocation into the cytosol of nerve terminals.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the c-fos gene is transiently induced at birth in most organs in the mouse. To study the basis of this induction we searched for a nuclear factor that binds to the 5' regulatory region of the c-fos gene. Gel mobility shift assays with tissue extracts revealed fast (band I) and slow (band III) migrating bands, which represent factor binding to the c-fos enhancer, termed the serum response element (SRE). Neonatal extracts preferentially elicited band I, with low or undetectable levels of band III, whereas fetal and adult extracts generated predominantly band III, with reduced levels of band I. These results indicate that the SRE-binding activity changes during perinatal development and that the appearance of band I, which coincides with diminution of band III, correlates with neonatal c-fos induction. Methylation interference and competition analyses showed that the neonatal factor (band I) binds to the SRE at a site different from the adult factor (band III). DNA-binding activity of the adult factor, but not the neonatal factor, was sensitive to phosphatase treatment. Furthermore, the adult factor, but not the neonatal factor, shared antigenic specificity with the human serum response factor (SRF) that is expressed in cultured cells irrespective of c-fos gene induction. We conclude that band I in neonates represents a SRE-binding factor that is distinct from the SRF, which may be responsible for the neonatal induction of the c-fos gene. The band III factor was indistinguishable from the SRF in all criteria tested.\r"

If true, DNA repair would be expected to contribute to genome stability. One type of repair that appears to play an important role in the response of many organisms to DNA-damaging agents involves recombination. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a pair of DNA divergent (homoeologous) chromosomes, we have been able to determine the importance of recombinational repair of DNA damage in the maintenance of chromosome number. Specifically, the induction of aneuploidy by ionizing radiation has been examined in diploids that had one chromosome III replaced by a divergent chromosome from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis. The chromosomes are functionally equivalent but lack precise DNA homology over one-half their length. The absence of homology, and thus the opportunity for recombinational repair (presumably of DNA double-strand breaks) in the divergent chromosomes, results in high levels (5-10%) of aneuploidy for chromosome III at doses of radiation resulting in almost no killing. For homologous chromosomes, the frequency of loss is 20-50 times lower.\r"

To test whether human XY females are produced by the same mechanism, we followed the inheritance of paternal pseudoautosomal loci and Xp22.3-specific loci in two XY female patients. Y-specific sequences and the whole pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome of their fathers were absent in these patients. However, the entire pseudoautosomal region and the X-specific part of Xp22.3 distal to the STS locus had been inherited from the X chromosome of the respective father. This Xp transfer to Yp was established by in situ hybridization experiments showing an Xp22.3-specific locus on Yp in both cases. Such results demonstrate that an abnormal and terminal X-Y interchange generated the rearranged Y chromosome of these two XY females; they appear to be the true countertype of Y(+) XX males. In these patients, who also display some Turner stigmata, the Y gene(s) involved in this phenotype is (are) localized to interval 1 or 2. If the loss of such gene(s) affects fetal viability, their proximity to TDF would account for the underrepresentation of interchange 46,XY females compared with Y(+) XX males.\r"

Quantitation of infrared spectra of papain-solubilized HLA-A2, HLA-B7, and DR1 in phosphate buffer gave alpha-helix contents of 17%, 8%, and 10% and beta-sheet contents of 41%, 48%, and 53%, respectively. By circular dichroism, papain-solubilized HLA-A2, HLA-B7, and DR1 were also found to have comparable alpha-helix contents (e.g., 8%, 20%, and 17%, respectively). Circular dichroism analysis for beta-sheet gave 29% for papain-solubilized HLA-B7 and 42% for papain-solubilized DR1. The value for papain-solubilized HLA-A2 (74%) was anomalous. It is proposed that Trp-107 of HLA-A2, missing in both HLA-B7 and DR1, may be responsible for much of the anomaly. Due to the uncertainties inherent in quantitation of the amounts of secondary structures by both spectral methods, the differences in the contents of alpha-helix and beta-sheet in the three proteins are not considered significant. However, differences in the nature of the beta-sheet structures are suggested by infrared spectroscopy. These results provide physical evidence for an overall structure of class II antigens modeled on that of class I antigens.\r"

The propositus, a 14-year-old female, and her 12-year-old sister had suffered from progressive muscle weakness, abnormal fatigability, and central nervous system dysfunction since early childhood. In the propositus, the state 3 respiratory rate of muscle mitochondria with NADH-linked substrates and with succinate was markedly reduced. The levels of cytochromes a + a3, b, and c + c1 were normal. The activities of complexes I, II, III, and IV of the electron transport chain were normal or increased. By contrast, the activities of complex I-III and of complex II-III, both of which need coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), were abnormally low. On direct measurement, the mitochondrial CoQ10 content was 3.7% of the mean value observed in 10 controls. Serum and cultured fibroblasts of the propositus had normal CoQ10 contents. In the younger sister, the respiratory activities and CoQ10 level of muscle mitochondria were similar to those observed in the propositus. The findings establish CoQ10 deficiency as a cause of a familial mitochondrial cytopathy and suggest that the disease results from a tissue-specific defect of CoQ10 biosynthesis.\r"

Three Ca2+-channel blockers, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, were used as antagonists for investigating the PDGF-dependent changes mediated by the homodimers. PDGF-BB had a greater efficacy than PDGF-AA on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release, on the formation of diacylglycerol, and on Ca2+ mobilization, which was also associated with vasoconstrictor activity and effective mitogenicity. PDGF-AA, on the other hand, was more potent than PDGF-BB in stimulating protein kinase C. In all instances, the activation of the phosphatidylinositol turnover by the two homodimers was inhibited by the Ca2+-channel blockers.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been implicated as a mediator of inflammation, allergy, shock, and thrombosis. A specific degradative enzyme, PAF acetylhydrolase (EC 3.1.1.47), is found in plasma and could regulate the concentration of PAF in blood. In plasma, 70% of the PAF acetylhydrolase is found with low density lipoprotein (LDL), and the remainder is in high density lipoprotein (HDL). In previous studies we found that with subsaturating concentrations of PAF the activity in LDL seemed to be the relevant one; e.g., depletion of LDL slowed degradation of PAF, while removal of HDL accelerated the degradation slightly. We have pursued this observation by using plasma from humans with lipoprotein mutations. In abetalipoproteinemia, all of the PAF acetylhydrolase activity was in HDL, whereas in Tangier disease all of the activity was in LDL. In both conditions the total activity measured in an optimized assay was normal or increased. However, when we measured the t1/2 of PAF in plasma, we found that it was prolonged in subjects with abetalipoproteinemia compared to normal controls. Conversely, the t1/2 in Tangier plasma was shortened. We next demonstrated that the PAF acetylhydrolase in HDL was recognized by an antibody to the enzyme purified from LDL, establishing that the enzyme in the two particles is the same protein. Finally, we inactivated the PAF acetylhydrolase in isolated lipoprotein particles and then reconstituted them with enzyme from the opposite particle. The reconstituted particles were used to measure the t1/2 of PAF, and we again found that the LDL particle was more efficient. We conclude that the lipoprotein environment of the PAF acetylhydrolase markedly influences its catalytic behavior. This may be important in pathophysiology and will complicate attempts to assess the role of this enzyme in such circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "A parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PTH-LP) has recently been identified in human tumors associated with the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The peptide appears to be encoded by a single-copy gene that gives rise to multiple mRNAs that are heterogeneous at both their 5' and their 3' ends. Alternative RNA splicing is responsible for the 3' heterogeneity and results in mRNAs encoding three different peptides, each with a unique C terminus. We have isolated and characterized the human PTHLP gene. The gene is a complex transcriptional unit spanning more than 12 kilobases of DNA and containing six exons. Two 5' exons encode distinct 5' untranslated regions and are separated by a putative promoter element, indicating that the gene either has two promoter or is alternatively spliced from a single promoter upstream of the first exon. The middle portion of the PTHLP gene, comprising exons 2-4, has an organizational pattern of introns and exons identical to that of the parathyroid hormone gene, consistent with a common ancestral origin of these two genes. Exon 4 of the PTHLP gene encodes the region common to all three peptides and the C terminus of the shortest peptide, and exons 5 and 6 encode the unique C termini of the other two peptides. Northern analysis of mRNAs from four human tumors of different histological types reveals the preferential use of 3' splicing patterns by individual tumors.\r"

  ".U": "89184638\r", 
  ".W": "Cachectin (tumor necrosis factor) is a powerful macrophage hormone released during infection, which circulates in blood to produce diverse effects in the organism. We examined the effect of cachectin on release of anterior pituitary hormones from either hemipituitaries or dispersed pituitary cells incubated in vitro. The action of cachectin on dispersed cells was demonstrable only after 2 hr of incubation. With this incubation time, the protein produced a dose-related stimulation of release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), and thyrotropin (TSH), but not of prolactin (Prl), from both hemipituitaries and dispersed cells. The doses required for stimulation were low in the case of hemipituitaries, usually of the order of 10(-12) M, whereas they were higher by one or two orders of magnitude with the dispersed pituitary cells. This may be related either to loss of receptors for the protein during the dispersion procedure or to the fact that in the hemipituitary system cell interactions are facilitated because the cells are close to each other. In the dispersed cell system cachectin evoked a dose-related decrease in cyclic AMP content. Incubation with somatostatin lowered the cyclic AMP content of the cells and depressed GH output without altering output of TSH or Prl. When somatostatin and cachectin were incubated together with the cells, the suppression of cyclic AMP production was abolished; TSH and Prl release were stimulated, but the action of cachectin to stimulate GH release was blocked. The stimulation of Prl release by cachectin in the presence of somatostatin may be related to the elevation of cyclic AMP, a known stimulator of Prl release. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin nearly completely blocked the stimulatory effect of cachectin on release of GH and TSH from dispersed pituitary cells but had only a slight and nonsignificant attenuating effect on its ACTH-releasing action. These results suggest that at least part of the stimulatory action of the peptide on pituitary hormone release is brought about by prostaglandins. The failure of indomethacin to block the release of ACTH induced by cachectin suggests that other mechanisms may be involved in the release of ACTH induced by this peptide. Since the concentrations of cachectin required to stimulate pituitary hormone release are similar to those that are encountered in plasma during infection, it is likely that this direct pituitary action has pathophysiological significance.\r"

The discovery of FIV provides an opportunity for the development of a small animal model for AIDS. To initiate the molecular and biological characterization of FIV, cDNA clones were synthesized and used to isolate a proviral clone of FIV. Molecular cross-hybridization analysis of FIV with five lentiviruses revealed that nucleotide-sequence similarities exist between FIV and these lentiviruses in the gag-pol genes. However, nucleotide-sequence similarities were not seen upon comparison of the FIV long terminal repeat sequence with known viral sequences. Common antigenic determinants appeared to be shared by FIV, caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, and visna virus as shown by serological cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies to caprine arthritis encephalitis virus and visna virus with the putative FIV core protein p28. These studies demonstrated that FIV is a member of the lentivirus subfamily and is distantly related to the AIDS lentiviruses of primates. Importantly, progeny virions of our molecular clone were infectious for experimentally inoculated cats. The availability of an infectious molecular clone will make possible a detailed dissection of the molecular pathogenesis of FIV, which may facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies for AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "To identify proteins that may be involved in the induction of long-term changes in the nervous system, we investigated whether specific proteins in pleural sensory neurons of Aplysia were affected by procedures that mimic those used to produce long-term sensitization. Using two-dimensional PAGE, we found that exposure to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) for 2 or 3 hr appeared to increase incorporation of labeled amino acids into one protein (P9) and decrease incorporation into two other proteins (P19 and P20). These effects of 5-HT were observed whether the labeled amino acid was leucine or methionine. The same proteins that were affected by 5-HT were also altered by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and by the 8-bromo and 8-benzylthio analogs of cAMP. Addition of Co2+ to 5-HT did not seem to affect the action of 5-HT on P9 and P20, but it did seem to block the effect of 5-HT on P19. However, the effect of analogs of cAMP on P9, P19, and P20 was not altered by inclusion of Co2+. A phorbol ester that activates protein kinase C did not appear to affect the proteins that were modified by 5-HT, but phorbol ester did appear to increase the amount of labeled amino acids incorporated into another protein (P24). To investigate the specificity of these effects for pleural ganglion neurons, we examined the effect of 3- and 6-hr treatments of 5-HT on proteins in the abdominal ganglion. 5-HT affected at least nine proteins in the abdominal ganglion. One of these proteins (P9) appeared to be the same as one altered by 5-HT in the pleural sensory neurons. However, the occurrence of some proteins and some effects of 5-HT were specific for one ganglion or the other. The identified proteins that were affected by both 5-HT and changes in cAMP may be involved in the induction of long-term changes in the nervous system of Aplysia.\r"

  ".U": "89184647\r", 
  ".W": "Neurofilaments (NFs) are the intermediate filaments specific to nervous tissue. They are probably essential to the tensile strength of the neuron, as well as to transport of molecules and organelles within the axon. Three peptides with apparent molecular masses of approximately 68 (NF-L), 145 (NF-M), and 200 (NF-H) kDa appear to be the major components of NF. The expression of these peptides is specific to nervous tissue and is developmentally regulated. Recently, complete cDNAs encoding NF-L and NF-M, and partial cDNAs encoding NF-H, have been described. To better understand the normal and pathophysiology of NFs we chose to clone the cDNA encoding the rat NF-H peptide. Using monoclonal antibodies that recognized NF-H, we screened a rat brain lambda gt11 library and identified a clone that contained a 2100-nucleotide cDNA insert representing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the NF-H protein. Anti-fusion protein antibodies recognized the NF-H peptide on immunoblots and stained fibrillar structures only in neurons. The cDNA recognized a 4500-nucleotide polyadenylated mRNA that was present only in nervous tissue and a 3500-nucleotide mRNA in adrenal. Brain NF-H mRNA levels were tightly developmentally regulated and paralleled the levels of NF-H peptide on immunoblots. Nuclear runoff studies showed that the 20-fold developmental increase in the NF-H message was due only in part to a 4-fold increase in its transcription rate. Levels of NF-H mRNA varied 20-fold among brain regions, with highest levels in pons/medulla, spinal cord, and cerebellum, and lowest levels in olfactory bulb and hypothalamus. Transcription studies revealed only a 2-fold difference in the transcription rates among these brain regions. Based on these results, we infer that half of the developmental increase and most of the interregional variation in the levels of the NF-H mRNA are mediated through message stabilization. Sequence information revealed that the carboxyl-terminal region of the NF-H peptide contained a unique serine-, proline-, alanine-, glutamic acid-, and lysine-rich repeat. The serine residues are likely sites of phosphorylation in the mature peptide. Genomic blots revealed a single copy of the gene in the rat genome and two copies in the human genome. In situ hybridizations performed on human chromosomes mapped the NF-H gene to chromosomes 1 and 22. Whether one copy is a pseudogene remains to be determined.\r"

Northern blot analysis demonstrated a significant developmental increase in the abundance of oxytocin mRNA in the female brain concomitant with puberty. Ovariectomy of adult females decreased total brain oxytocin mRNA to significantly lower levels. In contrast, lactating mothers had increased levels of neuronal oxytocin mRNA. In situ hybridization analysis of neuronal oxytocin mRNA in adolescent, mature virgin, and ovariectomized virgin female brains demonstrated that the location and number of neurons expressing oxytocin mRNA was unchanged and that total brain oxytocin mRNA differences were attributable to amounts expressed per neuron. Differences in mRNA abundance were noted in oxytocin neurons throughout the hypothalamus, including those known to project as magnocellular neurons to the neurohypophysis and those of parvocellular origin thought to make wholly intracerebral connections. This developmental and dynamic regulation of oxytocin mRNA levels during gonadal maturation may coordinate the peripheral and central effects of this peptide on the reproductive biology of the female rat.\r"

By contrast, the properties of neocortical pyramidal cell dendritic membranes have been more difficult to assess. Active dendritic conductances near sites of synaptic input would have an important effect on the input-output characteristics of these neurons. In the experiments reported here, we obtained direct evidence for the existence of voltage-dependent Na+ channels on the dendrites of neocortical neurons by using cell-attached patch and whole cell recordings from acutely isolated rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The qualitative and quantitative properties of dendritic and somatic currents were indistinguishable. Insofar as Na+ currents are concerned, the soma and primary apical dendrite can be considered as one relatively uniform compartment. Similar dendritic Na+ currents on dendrites in mature neurons would play an important role in determining the integrative properties of these cortical units.\r"

The treatment of narcoleptic dogs with PGE2 and PGE2 methyl ester, but not PGD2 and PGD2 methyl ester, induced a dose-dependent reduction of canine cataplexy, a dissociated manifestation of rapid-eye-movement sleep. The effect was specific and not associated with any change in other behavior. Furthermore, the effect was long-lasting (up to 2 hr) and could not be explained by the acute cardiovascular changes seen after intravenous PG administration. PGE2 methyl ester, a lipophilic derivative of PGE2 with more central penetration than PGE2, was 4 times more potent than PGE2. These results indicate that PGE2 modifies cataplexy through a central effect and suggest that this prostaglandin may play a role in rapid-eye-movement sleep regulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the levels of cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins in the striatum of patients with neurodegenerative diseases of the dopaminergic system. Postmortem samples of caudate nucleus and putamen from 24 control subjects, 23 patients with Parkinson disease, and 13 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy were studied with immunoblotting techniques. The levels of tyrosine hydroxylase were reduced in patients with Parkinson disease (levels were 24% and 10% of controls in caudate nucleus and putamen, respectively) and with progressive supranuclear palsy (levels were 11% and 6% of controls in caudate nucleus and putamen, respectively). Five phosphoproteins, which are present in striatal neurons and are likely to play a role in the postsynaptic actions of dopamine, were measured. These included ARPP-16, ARPP-19, ARPP-21 (cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins of Mr 16,000, 19,000, and 21,000, respectively), DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32,000), and phosphatase inhibitor I. The levels of these phosphoproteins were inversely correlated with postmortem delay. In brains of patients with Parkinson disease or progressive supranuclear palsy with postmortem delays comparable to those of controls, the levels of these proteins as well as those of synaptic (synapsin I and synaptophysin) and glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein and myelin basic protein) markers were not significantly modified. We conclude that the levels of several phosphoproteins involved in signal transduction in striatal neurons are not altered in Parkinson disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. This observation supports the view that the striatal output neurons are intact in both diseases.\r"

Phorbol esters, activators of the serine- and threonine-phosphorylating enzyme protein kinase C, selectively increase tyrosine phosphorylation of a soluble protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 40 kilodaltons. Muscarinic agonists such as carbachol and oxotremorine M that strongly activate the inositol phospholipid system also increase tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein. Neurotransmitter activation of the inositol phospholipid system and protein kinase C appears to trigger a cascade leading to increased tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

Cells of nonpregnant rabbits had a large Na+ absorptive current (11 microA/cm2 or 53% of baseline short circuit current) and a small Cl- secretory current (2.4 microA/cm2 or 11%). In contrast, fetal cells had greater Cl- secretion (15.1 microA/cm2 or 61%) and much less Na+ absorption (1.6 microA/cm2 or less than 10%). Cells of pregnant animals had amounts of Cl- secretion (11.4 microA/cm2 or 41%) and Na+ absorption (6.7 microA/cm2 or 22%) that were in between that of fetal and adult nonpregnant animals. In addition to these striking differences in baseline ion transport among the three groups, epinephrine was found to stimulate Cl- secretion in cells from pregnant rabbits, both Na+ absorption and Cl- secretion in cells from nonpregnant animals, and neither in fetal cells. Steroid hormones of pregnancy, progesterone and estradiol, when added to cells cultured from nonpregnant rabbits, altered the magnitudes of the individual transport pathways to mimic cells cultured from pregnant animals. In addition to changing baseline transport, these steroids modified the epinephrine-stimulated currents to resemble those in the fetus and in pregnancy. We conclude that steroid hormones regulate the balance of Na+ absorption and Cl- secretion in tracheal epithelia in utero and in adulthood.\r"

Using the patch-clamp technique, we find that the predominant channel in the LMTK- cell line is a bursting nonselective cation channel (the NS channel). In cell-attached and inside-out patches, the channel has a conductance of 28 pS; equal selectivity for Na+, K+, and Cs+; and no anion or divalent cation permeability. The channel open probability is voltage insensitive and in inside-out patches does not correlate with intracellular calcium (0.5 nM to 50 microM). When cultures are rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium, channel open probability is virtually 0 as compared to 0.26 (+/- 0.17) in exponentially growing cultures. If mitogenesis is initiated by readdition of serum to quiescent cells while maintaining cell-attached recording, there is a rapid (15-30 s) activation of the channel (n = 12). The open probability of the patch increases (greater than 0.75) for 2-3 min and then decreases. We have attempted applications of several growth factors (fibroblast-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, bombesin, alpha-thrombin, and vasopressin, individually or in combination) but find that only PDGF (5-100 ng/ml; n = 9) produces channel activation. This activation should provide a Na+ entry pathway parallel to that of the Na/H exchanger.\r"

The exercises were 1) sitting knee extension, 2) standing hip flexion, 3) an upper extremity range-of-motion exercise, and 4) lateral trunk flexion. Using an analysis of covariance, no significant difference was found in VO2 between the two groups; however, there was a significant difference among the four exercises. Oxygen consumption was lowest for both groups during the knee extension and the lateral trunk flexion exercises; both groups demonstrated the highest levels for VO2 during the hip flexion exercise. This study provides evidence that the energy cost of these low-intensity calisthenics is similar for healthy women and women with CAD.\r"

Three variables were evaluated: the amount of TFJA, pain elicited during the test, and the type of end-feel. When the test was performed with the subjects' knees in 0 degrees of flexion, the weighted Kappa value for judgments of motion was .06, the Kappa value for judgments of whether pain was elicited was .40, and the Kappa value for end-feel was .00. For the 30-degree test position, the weighted Kappa value for judgments of the amount of TFJA was .16, and the Kappa values for judgments of pain and end-feel were .33 and .38, respectively.

Measurements of pain-free grip strength and maximum grip strength for the involved limb and maximum grip strength for the uninvolved limb were taken on two test dates within seven days of each other. We calculated the variation between measurements within a test session and the variation from one session to the next using generalizability coefficients based on the mean of the six measurements. The coefficients for interrepetition, interoccasion, and overall generalizability were .99, .97, and .96, respectively. The clinical implication of these findings is that the overall generalizability can best be enhanced by averaging grip strength measurements recorded from multiple test sessions rather than by increasing the number of repetitions during a single test session.\r"

  ".U": "89185042\r", 
  ".W": "Conventional nerve grafts in complex digital injuries often yield poor results, particularly when placed in traumatized or avascular beds. Vascularized nerve grafts offer an option; experimental evidence suggests superior axonal regeneration across scarred beds with vascularized nerve grafts. We previously described a vascularized graft based on the dorsalis pedis artery--deep peroneal nerve \"system.\" Reluctance to sacrifice this major artery, combined with the recent description by Townsend and Taylor and Gu, et al, of \"reversed venous\" arterialized nerve grafts, spurred us on to investigate the deep peroneal nerve--dorsalis pedis venae comitantes system. Fourteen neurovenous grafts were used in scarred or poorly vascularized beds for digital nerve reconstruction in 10 patients over a 4-year period. Graft length averaged 4.4 cm; interval from injury was 1 to 17 months. Sensory parameters of return included average static two-point discrimination of 8.3 mm, moving two-point discrimination of 5.8 mm, and median Semmes-Weinstein monofilament appreciation of 2.83. Two patients received three vascularized grafts and three conventional grafts for adjacent nerve injuries in the same digit, serving as internal controls. In these patients, the vascularized nerve grafts returned mean static two-point discrimination values of 9.3 mm and moving two-point discrimination values of 6.7 mm. The conventional nerve grafts averaged static two-point discrimination of 14.3 mm and moving two-point discrimination values of 10.3 mm. These differences imply enhanced axonal regeneration through vascularized nerve grafts. These data suggest that the reversed neurovenous graft may be the procedure of choice in secondary reconstruction of digital nerves across scarred beds or following injuries with poor soft-tissue vascularity, especially in those patients with cold intolerance.\r"

Subjects were rated as exhibiting adequate to marginal velopharyngeal competency 94.5 percent of the time, and the incidence of compensatory articulation errors was low. In comparison with other studies that evaluated the two-stage palatal repair, the Zurich approach appears to give the better results. The type of initial soft palate repair is probably the significant factor which contributes to the better speech of these subjects.\r"

Thirteen patients had tarsoconjunctival wedge resections, and 10 had lateral canthopexies performed at the same procedure. One graft was too small and was later replaced. There was one hematoma, which was evacuated. There were no other lid or visual problems. The follow-up is short, 21 months maximum, but so far the results are very satisfactory.\r"

Two-hundred and fifty-six 1-month-old C3H mice were divided into four groups (control, 1; sham surgery, 2; mammectomy 50 percent, 3; and mammectomy 100 percent, 4). At the time of sacrifice (0 to 1 year postoperatively) estrus cycles were determined, ventral skin (breast) and ovaries were removed for histology, and serum was collected for prolactin assays. Prolactin levels 24 hours postoperatively were significantly elevated (p less than 0.01) in groups 2 to 4 when compared with group 1. Six months postoperatively, prolactin levels were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in mice with tumors compared with those without tumors in groups 3 and 4. There were no differences in tumor incidence between the four groups. At 12 months postoperatively, no differences in prolactin levels were noted, but group 2 animals had the highest incidence of mammary tumors (89 percent; p less than 0.01) when compared to groups 3 and 4. Mammary tumor incidence was not decreased by 50 percent or 100 percent mammectomy in C3H mice. Prolactin levels rose in response to surgery and/or anesthesia and remained elevated only in tumor-bearing mice who underwent mammectomy, an occurrence similar to that reported in humans.\r"

Of four patients in whom a preoperative diagnosis of pseudocyst was made, three had epigastric masses and a fourth presented with a mass of the chest wall. The three patients with epigastric masses were identified by physical examination and evaluated by aspiration of cyst contents. Imaging with computed tomography delineated cyst anatomy and assisted in confirmation of the diagnosis. Most likely, the pathogenesis of these lesions is related to undrained or clinically undetected serous collections which ultimately form firm walls of fibrin. Although all the patients had ipsilateral rectus flap reconstructions, flap transposition does not appear to be causally related to any fluid accumulation. In one patient, a squamous carcinoma, probably arising from the original intraductal breast pathology, created physical and computed tomographic findings suggestive of pseudocyst. Therefore, confirmation of the diagnosis by biopsy, combined with excision, or, at least, biopsy of the anterior cyst wall is recommended in patients with this condition. All three patients with epigastric pseudocysts were explored. There have been no recurrences after an average of 28 months.\r"

In 22 dogs, the skin expanded 34.4 percent in the 2-week and 35.8 percent in the 6-week protocol, excluding stretch and recruitment. There was thinning of the panniculus carnosus in the 6-week group and otherwise no significant decrease in dermal thickness in either group. The biomechanical properties of elasticity and creep did not differ in expanded skin from both groups, while stress/relaxation mildly decreased from a control value of 53.5 percent to 48.8 percent in the 6-week group (p less than 0.05). Collagen activity was increased in both the 6-week and the 2-week groups (p less than 0.001) over nonexpanded skin, and immunohistochemical staining with a monoclonal procollagen antibody demonstrated collagen synthesis by dermal fibroblasts in both groups. We conclude that rapid tissue expansion did not demonstrate any deleterious effects when compared with a conventional regimen.\r"

Total tourniquet time and the procedure performed, including intraoperative Bovie electrocautery of actual and potential bleeding points identified with 2.5 X loupe magnification, were identical on the two sides, except for the method of tourniquet release. On one leg, the tourniquet was released and all new bleeding points were controlled prior to wound closure. On the other leg, the tourniquet was released after the wound had been closed and dressed. Animals were injected with technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells and scanned to measure hematoma formation. Qualitatively, we observed more label in the leg whose tourniquet was released after wound closure in 17 of the 20 animals (p less than 0.005). Quantitatively, we also measured more mean label in the leg whose tourniquet was released after the wound was closed (p less than 0.001). Tourniquet release after wound closure was associated with greater hematoma formation.\r"

  ".W": "We conducted a phase I clinical trial of the feasibility of using the Thermotron RF-8, a capacitative heating device utilizing 8-MHz RF, for the treatment of deep-seated and bulky human tumors. Preclinical studies with agar phantoms demonstrated that deep heating can be achieved with this device when the electrode diameters are sufficiently large relative to the thickness of the heated object. In the clinical application of capacitive heating with radiofrequency, excessive heating of subcutaneous tissue has often been a problem. However, this could be minimized by continuous cooling of the subcutaneous fat with a 10 degrees C saline bolus, beginning more than 20 minutes prior to the start of heating. It was often possible to raise the temperature of deep-seated tumors even in obese patients by applying this pre-cooling method. The mean achieved temperature during 30 to 40 minutes of heating was higher than 42 degrees C and 40 degrees C to 42 degrees C in 26% and 50% of 58 tumors treated, respectively. A combination of hyperthermia (four to ten sessions, twice a week) with full-course or a limited dose of radiotherapy resulted in complete tumor remission in 7% of patients, and partial tumor remission in 50% of patients. In the full-course radiotherapy group, 69% of the tumors were judged to show complete or partial regression, and in the low-dose group, 43% of the tumors regressed completely or partially. Histologic examination of many of the tumors that did not regress showed massive necrosis, indicating that tumor size after hyperthermia is not an accurate criterion of the treatment result. Side effects were minimal, and vital sign changes during heating were insignificant. Our data, together with those reported by Japanese investigators, clearly demonstrated that hyperthermia with the Thermotron RF-8 in combination with radiotherapy is useful in treating deep-seated and bulky tumors that fail to respond to conventional treatment modalities.\r"

The CT appearances of radiographic type p small rounded opacities in 55 patients were compared with the appearances of type q and r opacities. Radiographic type p pneumoconiosis on high-resolution CT scans was characterized by tiny binary branching structures or a gathering of a few dots. In 21 of the 55 patients, nonperipheral, small areas of low attenuation with a central dot were found. On the basis of CT-pathologic correlation in two postmortem specimens, these tiny opacities and areas of low attenuation corresponded to irregular fibrosis around and along the respiratory bronchioles and to focal-dust emphysema, respectively. Focal emphysema was most commonly found in pneumoconiosis with p-type changes and can be identified with high-resolution CT scanning. The addition of high-resolution CT to chest radiography is useful in achieving more accurate categorization of the lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The appearance of the costal pleura at high-resolution computed tomography (CT) was evaluated with a cadaver and 25 normal subjects. This was contrasted with the high-resolution CT appearance of the costal pleura in 15 patients with mild pleural thickening, 13 of whom had been exposed to asbestos. On high-resolution CT scans in the normal subjects, a 1-2-mm-thick line of soft-tissue attenuation at the point of contact between lung and chest wall represents the visceral and parietal pleura, pleural contents, endothoracic fascia, and innermost intercostal muscle. In a paravertebral location, the innermost intercostal muscle is lacking, and a thin line seen on high-resolution CT scans reflects pleura and endothoracic fascia. Transverse thoracic and subcostal muscles and extrapleural fat pads can be seen as tissue internal to a rib and may be confused with pleural thickening. In 13 of the 15 patients with mild pleural thickening, the 1-3-mm-thick pleura was separable from the underlying normal intercostal muscle by a layer of extrapleural fat. High-resolution CT was more sensitive than CT with 1-cm collimation in depicting this degree of pleural abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Six painful hips in five patients were examined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and were found to have diffuse signal abnormalities in the marrow of the femoral head and neck, which extended into the intertrochanteric area in five cases. The abnormal regions were low in signal intensity on images obtained with a short repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE) and were isointense or hyperintense on long TR/TE images--findings that have been attributed by others to bone marrow edema. Edema was also seen in marrow just above the acetabulum in two cases. No focal abnormalities characteristic of osteonecrosis were seen. Osteonecrosis was subsequently shown to be present in all six femoral heads at core biopsy (three cases) or by subsequent development of focal MR abnormalities reported to be highly specific for osteonecrosis (three cases). The affected hips had been radiographically normal or subtly osteopenic and had shown intense radionuclide uptake in the femoral head at scintigraphy, with lesser abnormality in the neck and intertrochanteric region. Follow-up MR examinations of five of the six femoral heads showed the diffuse abnormalities to have been transient. Although diffuse MR abnormalities in the proximal femur are not specific, they may indicate the presence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.\r"

The locations of suspected osteomyelitis were divided into central (containing active bone marrow), peripheral (hands and feet), and middle (between central and peripheral). Specificity remained high (about 90%) regardless of the location. Overall sensitivity was significantly lower in the central location than in the peripheral or middle location. Determination of whether the In-111 leukocyte activity was in bone or adjacent soft tissue was also more difficult when the infection was in the central location. For acute osteomyelitis, sensitivity was high regardless of the location. For chronic osteomyelitis, sensitivity was lower in the central location.\r"

These findings occurred in conjunction with documented clinical improvement of the patients' condition. T2-weighted images revealed isointense signals initially at the abnormal sites. Isointense signals prevailed on follow-up T2-weighted images. These MR imaging findings are likely due to transient bone marrow edema. These findings support the apparent sensitivity of MR imaging in the evaluation of marrow-based pathologic processes. Some pediatric patients with hip pain may have signs of transient bone marrow edema, rather than avascular necrosis, on MR images. Conservative management should be considered in such cases.\r"

Bone marrow in the clivus and calvaria had uniformly low signal intensity (grade 1) on T1-weighted images in most infants less than 1 year old. The number of patients with grade 1 marrow decreased rapidly in early childhood, while the number of patients with marrow of low and high signal intensity (grade 2) and uniformly high signal intensity (grade 3) gradually increased with age. A grade 1 marrow was no longer observed in either the clivus or calvaria after age 7. Most patients had a grade 3 marrow by age 15. Because bone marrow in certain pathologic conditions has decreased signal on T1-weighted images and therefore resembles grade 1 or 2 appearances of normal marrow in children, these results may be useful for differentiating normal and abnormal bone marrow signal intensities in infants and children.\r"

The MR images were obtained on a 2.35-T system with a closely fitting probe head. A conventional spin-echo sequence was used, with T1- and T2-weighted settings. The in-plane resolution obtained was about 0.3 mm. The T2-weighted images generally showed better contrast and allowed identification of the perichondrium. The resolutions used were not much greater than those clinically available. The findings suggest that there will be important advances in clinical MR imaging of the larynx in the near future.\r"

T1- and T2-weighted MR images demonstrated a significantly higher number of lesions than did CT. Patients with BSI had a significantly higher frequency of corpus callosum and diffuse axonal \"shear\" lesions. The number of cortical contusions and extraaxial hematomas was similar in both groups. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores at admission were significantly lower in patients with evidence of BSI on MR images. Patients with primary BSI had lower initial GCS scores, a longer duration of coma, more diffuse axonal \"shear\" lesions, and a higher frequency of corpus callosum injury than patients with secondary BSI. The location of primary and secondary lesions was significantly different. Overall, MR imaging was more helpful than CT in detecting, localizing, and characterizing BSI.\r"

The pars interarticularis forms the only boundary between the inferior recess of one facet joint and the superior recess of the adjacent joint.

At surgery the posterior ligament was found to be disrupted in eight cases and intact in 11. Absence of a low-signal peripheral line around the herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) was the most reliable sign of ligament rupture (no false-negative or false-positive findings). The peripheral line appeared to be interrupted in four cases, two of which were falsely positive. The two false-positive cases were related to a chemical shift artifact between epidural fat and the HNP. Presence of a normal and continuous peripheral line outlining the HNP excluded ligament disruption. The overall sensitivity for detecting disruption was 100%, and the specificity was 78%.\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) images of 22 patients with tetralogy of Fallot were studied to assess their usefulness in providing information regarding the spectrum of anatomic abnormalities in this condition. MR findings were compared with information obtained at catheterization (in 16 patients) and at surgery (in nine patients), both of which were performed within 3 months of MR imaging. Ventricular chamber enlargement and wall hypertrophy were clearly delineated in most of the 17 patients who were examined before definitive surgical repair, and ventricular septal defects were visualized in all 17. Palliative systemic-to-pulmonary shunts were visualized in 11 patients and could be evaluated for patency. Most important, the morphology and size of the right ventricular outflow tract and central pulmonary arteries could be accurately assessed. Pulmonary artery measurements obtained from MR images demonstrated excellent correlation with angiographic measurements. In six patients examined after complete surgical repair, MR images accurately reflected changes in pulmonary artery outflow tract morphology and complications, such as residual pulmonary artery stenosis and thrombosis. The findings suggest that MR imaging can complement or obviate catheterization in the evaluation of tetralogy of Fallot with regard to suitability for definitive surgical repair.\r"

The relative excess of tracer in the jugular vein region was significantly greater in the study animals than in the control animals throughout the study period. Blind reading of serial scans revealed no visible tracer accumulation in seven of eight control rabbits, whereas the scans of seven of nine study rabbits showed clearly visible accumulation (sensitivity = 77%, specificity = 87%). The Fab fragment of MA-15C5 had a lower affinity and bound less avidly to the blood clot in vivo.

It was capable of depicting the location and extent of tumor invasion of cervical stroma and helped detect tumor beneath relatively normal epithelium or within the endocervical canal that had not been detected by means of colposcopic biopsy. The overall accuracy of MR imaging in staging carcinoma of the cervix was 76%, and in demonstrating parametrial status, the overall accuracy was 89%. In 39 patients with proven invasive disease, the accuracy in demonstrating parametrial status was 82%. In 13 of these 39 patients the low-signal-intensity stromal ring of the cervix on MR images was completely preserved and there were no false-positive results. MR imaging is a highly promising method for directly demonstrating and staging carcinoma of the cervix and seems to be capable of providing answers to crucial questions regarding mode of therapy.\r"

Each image was digitized and reviewed at nine decreasing compression ratios ranging from 90:1 to 4.2:1, followed by a review of the uncompressed digital images. Four radiologists independently reviewed the digitized images and the original radiographs and agreed on a reference standard of 201 findings. Sensitivity, measured by the number of findings noted on the compressed digital images, decreased with increasing compression ratios at and above the 11:1 level. No loss of sensitivity was noted with a compression ratio of 4.2:1. Sensitivity decreased more precipitously for calcifications than for soft-tissue masses. Only a minimal loss of sensitivity for bilateral renal function was noted, even with high compression ratios. False-positive rates were unaffected by compression. The authors conclude that quadtree compression ratios of 11:1 and higher may result in loss of sensitivity in clinically relevant findings.\r"

MR images are segmented, selectively enhanced, and displayed by means of a volumetric rendering algorithm. These techniques were used to illustrate normal anatomy of the brain, knee, and liver. Three-dimensional rendering of balanced spin-echo images shows the ventricles and extracerebral veins and of T1-weighted images, the sulci and gyri. The large hepatic and portal vessels can be seen with these enhancement techniques. Three-dimensional views of the knee reveal articular surfaces of the tibia and clearly depict menisci and posterior and anterior cruciate ligaments. These techniques make it possible to image multiple soft tissues simultaneously while preserving the detail contained in the original images. Three-dimensional presentation of complex, overlapping anatomic regions is helpful in surgical planning and should lead to improved diagnosis.\r"

Blunt hepatic injury was diagnosed in 187 patients, and review revealed 37 patients in whom the liver was the site of sole or principal intraabdominal injury detected with the help of CT before surgery. A CT-based hepatic injury classification system partly derived from similar systems established with surgical assessment was devised to grade the severity of hepatic injury. CT-based injury scores ranging from grade 1 to 5 were compared with the clinical outcome in patients treated surgically and nonsurgically. Thirty-one patients (83.7%) were successfully treated without surgery, and four patients (10.8%) had findings at celiotomy that did not require further surgery. No patient who was initially treated without surgery required delayed celiotomy due to hepatic injury. The results indicate that even major hepatic injury up to and including grade 4 severity assessed with preoperative CT can usually be managed without surgery in hemodynamically stable patients.\r"

  ".W": "Nonsurgical management of blunt splenic injury in children is a well-established method to salvage splenic function; however, nonsurgical management of adult blunt splenic trauma remains controversial. To assess the value of preoperative abdominal CT in predicting the outcome of blunt splenic injury in adults, a CT-based injury-severity score consisting of four grades was devised and applied in 39 adult patients with blunt splenic injury as the sole or predominant intraperitoneal injury detected with preoperative CT. While patients with high grades of splenic injury generally required early surgery, eight (35%) of 23 patients with initial grade 3 or 4 injury were treated successfully without surgery, and four (29%) of 15 patients with grade 1 or 2 injury initially treated nonsurgically required delayed celiotomy (n = 3) or emergency rehospitalization. Results show that while CT remains an accurate method of identifying and quantifying initial splenic injury, as well as documenting progression or healing of critical injury, CT cannot reliably help predict the outcome of blunt splenic injury in adults. Treatment choices should therefore be based on the hemodynamic status of the patient and results of serial laboratory and bedside assessments.\r"

Pathologic evaluation of the resected liver specimens demonstrated 37 lesions. The sensitivities were 81% (30 of 37 lesions) for CTAP, 57% (21 of 37 lesions) for MR imaging, 52% (12 of 23 lesions) for DCT, and 38% (14 of 37 lesions) for contrast-enhanced CT. The difference between the sensitivity of CTAP and the sensitivities of the other imaging tests was statistically significant (P less than .004). Of the lesions smaller than 1 cm in diameter, CTAP depicted 61% (11 of 18 lesions), MR imaging 17% (three of 18 lesions), CT 0% (zero of 18 lesions), and DCT 0% (zero of nine lesions). It is concluded that for preoperative detection of focal hepatic masses, CTAP is the most accurate technique available to most radiologists. Patients with primary or secondary hepatic neoplasms who are being considered for hepatic resection should undergo CTAP as part of their preoperative examination.\r"

The cystic content was differentiated more easily with MR imaging than with CT. It was homogeneous in four of the five microcystic adenomas, all of which had lobulated borders best seen on T2-weighted images. The mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas were all composed of multiple compartments that varied in signal intensity. The septa, shape, and wall thickness were demonstrated on T1- and/or T2-weighted MR images almost as well as on CT scans. Overall, MR imaging was equal or slightly superior to CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, except in its limited ability to demonstrate calcifications of the tumor wall and septa.\r"

However, by entrapping the Gd-DTPA within lipid vesicles, one may exploit the ability of the reticuloendothelial system to endocytose particulates, permitting passive delivery of contrast agent to the liver and spleen while decreasing the rate of clearance of Gd-DTPA from the vasculature. Liposomes of 70-400 nm diameter containing Gd-DTPA were prepared by a freeze-thaw extrusion process. These exhibited high trapping efficiencies and excellent stability during storage. For all sizes of liposomes, the relaxivity of the entrapped Gd-DTPA was less than that of free Gd-DTPA. Relaxivity varied linearly with the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the liposomes; the smaller the liposomes, the greater the relaxivity. Liposomes containing cholesterol had a lower relaxivity than liposomes without cholesterol. The authors suggest this reflects the decrease in the water permeability coefficient caused by the presence of cholesterol in the liposome membrane.\r"

Liposomal Gd-DTPA-enhanced images permitted significant improvement in metastasis detection by five blinded radiologists (P less than .005). By comparison, free Gd-DTPA without liposomes caused a statistically significant reduction in contrast between tumor and liver and reduced lesion detection (P less than .01). Liposomal Gd-DTPA also resulted in sustained vascular enhancement for 1 hour after administration. The results suggest that paramagnetic liposomes may become a useful MR imaging contrast agent.\r"

The organizing group should consist of physician users, experts in mammography, statisticians, and administrators. Data regarding the number and type of studies, findings, interpretations, and recommendations could be collected and reported easily and cheaply with a standardized form. The registry could be financed by federal, state, or private funds; the latter are most preferable, but a combination of the three is most feasible.

When individual metals were tested, only Mg++ stimulated cell growth and TSST-1 production. TSST-1 yield was responsive to the concentration of Mg++ in the medium, with a maximal yield occurring at 0.1 mM. When other metals were studied in the presence of Mg++ with and without 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, it was found that Ca++, Co++, Cu++, Fe++, Mn++, molybdate-, Ni++, vanadate-, and Zn++ produced some stimulation of either cell growth or TSST-1 synthesis or both. The stimulating effect of Mg++ on TSST-1 synthesis was significantly enhanced by adding 0.3 mM Zn++ and 0.003 mM Fe++. TSST-1 production by 11 strains of S. aureus in CDM with optimal concentrations of trace metals was two to seven times greater than that produced in brain-heart infusion broth.\r"

Since many of the fibers previously used in tampons combine with Mg++, an explanation for the pathogenesis of menstrually related toxic shock syndrome presents itself. Pitfalls in the reproduction of these experiments have been investigated and include attention to inoculum size, to the effect of washing the inoculum to rid it of magnesium from the parent culture, and related variables. The growth of staphylococci in magnesium-deficient medium is slower than in the usual culture media, making it necessary that the effect of magnesium deficiency be examined after sufficient incubation to permit maximal toxin production to occur. When these variables are taken into account, a coherent theory to explain the pathogenesis of menstrual TSS emerges. Absorbency of tampons, which correlates with the capacity to absorb Mg++, becomes, as has been suggested, a surrogate for the magnesium effect. The observations raise the possibility of a safer tampon, one in which the magnesium content is regulated to cause the staphylococci not to be in a magnesium-deficient environment.\r"

Using a syringe method, the tampons were saturated with diluted staphylococci in brain-heart infusion medium and incubated at 37 degrees C. Spent medium was expressed from the tampons and analyzed for growth of staphylococci and production of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). Results revealed no statistical difference in the production of TSST-1 by cells grown in rayon or cotton. However, a significant increase in TSST-1 production was observed in tampon cultures when compared with medium controls. When similar experiments were performed with tampons saturated with nitrogen, a significant decrease in TSST-1 production was observed when compared with air-saturated tampons. The results indicate that the oxygen normally present in tampons plays a significant role in modulating the production of TSST-1.\r"

The propensity of different fibers and other substances to amplify TSST-1 production in toxic shock syndrome-associated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a comparative analysis of the underlying mechanisms of TSST-1 production, are reported. Two hundred twenty intravaginal devices or other products and materials and 60 experimental controls were examined for their propensity to induce TSST-1 production. Certain materials are superior to unaltered cotton in providing a more absorbent fiber--nutrients are efficiently drawn in, concentrating protein between fibers, and thereby creating an ideal physicochemical environment for the amplification of TSST-1 and other toxins. The greatest stimulation of TSST-1 was observed with (in decreasing order): polyester and carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylates, viscose rayon, gelatin foam, polyurethane, and cotton. No toxin was found with nasal tampons (polymer of polyvinyl acetal) or with vaginal cups (an elastomeric polymer). Results are discussed in terms of specific ecologic parameters from historical as well as recent perspectives.\r"

Because of the biochemical and nutritional differences between these media and human menses, a program was designed to determine the growth and metabolism of S. aureus under conditions that more closely approximate in vivo conditions. Human menses, an artificial menses developed to match human menses, whole human blood, and complex bacterial culture media (with and without added whole human blood) were tested for the ability to support the growth of S. aureus and the production of TSST-1 in vitro. In addition, the impact of other organisms, commonly isolated from the human vagina, on the growth of S. aureus and the production of TSST-1 was evaluated. Results show that the environmental conditions provided by human menses are more closely approximated by the artificial menses and that neither commercial bacterial growth media alone nor complex media plus 25% or 50% human blood provide a menses-like environment for the growth of S. aureus and the production of TSST-1. Furthermore, the addition of a second organism to the S. aureus culture resulted in significant suppression of TSST-1 production, even when in vitro conditions were optimized for the production of TSST-1.\r"

Disks of tampon core materials with and without wraps were placed on the inoculated membranes and incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 in air. Eight wraps with each of 14 tampon core materials were tested to determine the amount of toxin in the agar layer, a quantity considered an indicator of the relative amounts of toxin available for absorption in vivo. The average level of toxin in the agar layer with any particular wrap compared with that in the agar layer with no wrap was higher with five wraps, lower with two wraps, and essentially the same with one wrap. The lower levels of toxin were obtained with one wrap that had a starch binder and with one that contained the surfactant Standamul 1414-E. Standamul 1414-E has been reported to be an inhibitor of growth of and production of TSST-1 by S. aureus.\r"

The former strain carries the TSST-1 gene on plasmid pRN6201; the latter is a TSST-1-negative clinical isolate obtained from a patient with nonmenstrual TSS. Purified monoclonal antibody, MAb 8-5-7 (IgG), was administered in two doses of approximately 1.25 mg each 24 hours before and 24 hours after infection. MAb 8-5-7 provided complete protection against both the TSS-like syndrome and the mortality that occurred in unprotected rabbits infected with strain RN4710 but did not provide complete protection in rabbits infected with strain D4508; three of the five rabbits either displayed signs of illness or died despite treatment. Western-blot analyses of the extracellular proteins produced by strains RN4710 and D4508 that used MAb 8-5-7 as a probe revealed that only TSST-1 produced by RN4710 reacted with the antibody. Thus, if MAb 8-5-7 partially protected animals against infections with strain D4508, the protection appears to have been nonspecific.\r"

In both of these models, toxins and TSST-1 are allowed to diffuse constantly from a subcutaneous depot. Immunologic inactivation of endotoxin with antiserum to the core lipopolysaccharide did not change the clinical course or mortality among animals infected with live TSS-associated staphylococci or among animals with a subcutaneous depot of TSST-1. Anti-TSST-1 was successful in preventing disease and death in these models. Pharmacologic inactivation of endotoxin by pretreatment or continuous treatment with polymyxin B did not prevent illness or mortality in the toxin depot model. Endotoxin thus appears not to be an essential mediator in TSS, since TSS-like illness develops and progresses despite inactivation of endotoxin in animal model systems that are faithful both physiologically and clinically to TSS in humans.\r"

No definite or probable cases of TSS were found in men during either 1984 or 1985. A total of 16 cases of TSS (10 definite and six probable) were found in women in 1984-1985.

Of the 16 cases, 14 (88%) were diagnosed as TSS or probable TSS by the attending physician, although only nine (64%) of the 14 diagnosed cases were given the correct discharge code. While trends in the incidence of TSS requiring hospitalization in women 15-34 years of age generally paralleled changes in the absorbency of available tampons, the contribution of other factors (e.g., changes in the chemical composition of tampons, changes in patterns of tampon use) to these trends could not be assessed.\r"

Three small generic compressed-fiber tampons were successively inserted vaginally (remained in place 4.5 hours x 2; overnight x 1). Tampon no. 1 was inoculated with live TSST-1-positive staphylococci plus 5 mL of saline or simulated menses (defibrinated rabbit blood plus 2.5 g of bovine serum albumin/dL) immediately after insertion; saline or simulated menses alone were used with tampons no. 2 and 3. The vagina was washed after removal of tampon no. 3. TSS-like illness was produced consistently in animals with carboxymethyl cellulose/polyester foam tampons, which supported higher organism counts and greater TSST-1 production in association with subsequent tampons. Cotton and rayon tampons were not associated with as much clinical illness, organism growth, or TSST-1 production. Simulated menses supported toxin production and clinical illness when the inoculum was one-tenth that required for controls. Sham tampon insertion was associated with TSS-like illness in two of 10 rabbits; thus, other factors may promote TSS in the absence of vaginal tampons. This model reliability reproduces menstrual TSS, since one-time vaginal inoculation with TSST-1-positive staphylococci in the presence of blood and certain tampons leads to TSS, and may be useful in evaluating catamenial products and in understanding other factors important in TSST-1 production in vivo and the development of TSS.\r"

In an investigation of the mode of action of TSST-1, its effect-both singly and in combination with LPS-on tissue culture cell lines was examined. Of a variety of cell lines examined for sensitivity to TSST-1 treatment, only primary chick embryo cells were susceptible. At a critical concentration (0.2 microgram/mL), TSST-1 alone caused detachment of the cell monolayer. In contrast, LPS per se had no visible effect on the cells at any concentration tested. TSST-1 in combination with LPS caused monolayer detachment at all concentrations of TSST-1 employed; thus detachment was independent of TSST-1 concentration in the presence of LPS. The ability of TSST-1 to disrupt the monolayer was neutralized in the presence of polyclonal rabbit antiserum to TSST-1. In a time course study over 24 hours, the effect of the toxin on the cells was initially visible by light microscopy after 4-7 hours. Clear differences in cellular morphology between TSST-1 treated monolayers and untreated controls were observed by scanning electron microscopy. Treated cells lost their normal spindle-shaped appearance before detachment.\r"

Among cases in females, 83 (55%) were menstrual; the mean age of the patients with menstrual cases was 23 years (range, 12-46 years). The overall incidence of TSS was 0.53/100,000. The cumulative incidence varied significantly by region, ranging from 1.23/100,000 in Oklahoma to 0.22/100,000 in New Jersey (P = .0001); the incidence in all other areas ranged from 0.39/100,000 to 0.70/100,000. The incidence of menstrual TSS was 1.05/100,000 women 15-44 years of age and peaked in women between the ages of 15 and 19 years at 1.52/100,000. The incidence was higher in whites than in nonwhites for both menstrual TSS (1.21/100,000 vs. 0.34/100,000, P = .002) and nonmenstrual TSS (0.30/100,000 vs. 0.14/100,000, P = .031). Our data indicate that TSS continues to be a cause of morbidity. Although there is underreporting in national passive surveillance, the proportion of menstrual cases reported through active surveillance was similar to that reported to the passive system in 1986.\r"

A pre-embedding electron-microscopic immunogold technique revealed that TSST-1 was located in the veins and arteries on the surface of endothelial cells and in the area of cell contacts. Umbilical cord vein segments filled with TSST-1 were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C, fixed by perfusion and embedded in hydrophilic resin (Lowicryl K4M). Postembedding immunogold staining of ultrathin sections showed TSST-1 in the vesicles crossing the cytoplasm of the veins' endothelial cells and entering underlying elastic and collagen layers.\r"

This activity was sensitive to heat, trypsin, and formaldehyde but resistant to neuraminidase or galactose oxidase. Formaldehyde-fixed Propionibacterium acnes or Escherichia coli cells reactive with plant lectins provided sensitive targets for titration of serum agglutination activity that was competitively blocked with D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and alpha-L-fucose. The lectin-like activity, partially purified by affinity chromatography, was a protein of approximately 76,000 Da with an isoelectric point of 5.4. Both lectin-positive and normal serum contained agglutination inhibitors that were absorbed by protein A-producing staphylococci. S protein may be the origin of this lectin-like activity. In vitro exposure of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to TSST-1 (1.0 micrograms/mL) and to lectin-positive serum induced rapid cell clumping and subsequent \"activation\" to a larger blast form expressing receptors for buccal epithelial cells. The interaction of toxin/lymphokine-activated mononuclear cells with glycoproteins and/or other antigens selectively expressed by tissues in various organ systems may play a role in target cell pathology in rabbits dying with toxic shock syndrome.\r"

The cardiac dysfunction may be mediated by toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), an exotoxin generated by Staphylococcus aureus. However, the effects of purified TSST-1 on cardiac function are unknown. In a study of the toxin's effect on myocardial function, TSST-1 (200 ng/mL) was added to muscle baths containing isolated rabbit atria. TSST-1 caused time-dependent inhibition of developed force (systolic function) but did not alter resting force (an index of muscle stiffness or cardiac compliance). These data show that TSST-1 can directly inhibit myocardial function, but the significance of this effect in patients with toxic shock syndrome remains to be determined.\r"

Age-matched controls were selected from among each patient's friends and women with the same telephone exchange. Of 118 eligible patients, 108 were enrolled, as were 185 \"friend controls\" and 187 telephone exchange-matched controls. Tampon use was a risk factor for developing TSS during menstruation (odds ratio = 29; 95% confidence interval = 7-120), and risk increased with increasing tampon absorbency (odds ratio = 1.34 per gram increase in absorbency; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-1.6). The role of tampon chemical composition could not be assessed because the number of cases was inadequate. Neither use of birth control pills for contraception nor use of medications for premenstrual or menstrual symptoms protected against or was a risk factor for the development of menstrual TSS.\r"

This association was evaluated in a case-control study of nonmenstrual TSS; cases were identified through an active surveillance system for TSS during 1986 and 1987. Potential risk factors for nonmenstrual TSS were compared for 28 patients and 100 age-matched controls. Use of barrier contraceptives was associated with a significantly increased risk of nonmenstrual TSS, with matched odds ratios of 10.5 and 11.7 for contraceptive sponge and diaphragm use, respectively. Use of nonbarrier contraceptive methods was unrelated to nonmenstrual TSS. Despite the elevated odds ratio, the incidence of nonmenstrual TSS in barrier contraceptives users and the risk of nonmenstrual TSS attributable to barrier contraceptive use are low. Clinicians and women who use barrier contraceptives should be aware of this rare but potentially fatal complication; however, other considerations, such as efficacy and complications associated with other types of contraception, may be more important in the choice of a contraceptive method.\r"

The purpose of this report is to review previous studies and describe the results of laboratory tests that compare the effects of use of various tampons on the normal changes that occur in vaginal microflora during menstruation. Tampon and swab samples were obtained from volunteers on days 2, 4, and 21 after the start of menses. Statistical evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative data revealed that the same numerically dominant phenotypes were present regardless of sample type, sample time, or catamenial product. In general, total bacterial counts decreased during menstruation, and the total bacterial counts from tampon samples tended to be lower than those in concomitant swab samples. Predictable changes in total numbers of the dominant species were noted when the data were evaluated by day of menstrual cycle. Results indicate that the tampon type had little effect on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the vaginal microflora during the menstrual cycle.\r"

Sequential and semiquantitative vaginal cultures were obtained on days 3 +/- 2, 15 +/- 2, and 25 +/- 2 of the menstrual cycle (day 1, first day of menses) before and after randomization. Before randomization, the rate of isolation and median counts of facultative lactobacilli were significantly higher (P less than .05) and that of eubacteria was significantly lower (P = .026) among regular tampon users than among exclusive napkin users. After randomization, only median counts of coagulase-negative staphylococci were significantly increased (P = .025) during tampon use compared with the rates for the same women during napkin use. These shifts in vaginal microflora occurred only in samples obtained during menstruation and not in those obtained at other sampling times. The data presented here support the notion that the use of tampons may result in alterations in the autochthonous vaginal microflora. It remains to be determined if these ecologic shifts in the vaginal microflora may adversely affect resistance to colonization by potential pathogens in the lower female genital tract.\r"

This study sought to determine at what rate and under what circumstances nongenital toxigenic Staphylococcus aureus infections led to TSS. Clinical isolates of S. aureus were examined for the production of TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1), and available sera from infected patients were tested for antibody to this toxin. Twenty-six percent of 810 isolates produced TSST-1. Isolates from children were more likely to be positive for TSST-1 than were those from adults. None of 57 patients with TSST-1-positive staphylococcal infection and a TSST-1 antibody titer of greater than or equal to 1:100 developed TSS. Eight of 65 tested patients with TSST-1-positive isolates had antibody below the presumably protective level of 1:100. Two of these patients had definite TSS, three had probable or possible TSS, and three probably did not have TSS. In patients lacking protective antibody to TSST-1, the interval between acquisition and infection with staphylococci, the type and amount of toxins produced, the site of infection, and still-unclarified aspects of host susceptibility may all affect the rate and severity of TSS.\r"

Thus, DNA probes that detect the chromosomal gene encoding the toxin are of value diagnostically, epidemiologically, and for studies of gene expression. Several synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to two regions of the TSST-1 gene were used to ascertain the presence of this gene in the chromosomal DNA of 261 strains of S. aureus from various TSS-related and non-TSS-related sources. Isolates were from clinically confirmed menstrual and nonmenstrual cases of TSS and from healthy vaginal carriers of S. aureus. Other strains tested included clinical non-TSS isolates and food poisoning-associated staphylococcal isolates. Detection of the TSST-1 gene by the labeled gene probes correlated in all but two cases with production of TSST-1. Ten Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strains that were isolated from TSS patients and did not produce TSST-1 were also examined, as were several strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with suspected TSS. Neither group of strains possessed the TSST-1 gene. Finally, a 7-kilobase DNA restriction fragment of S. aureus containing the entire TSST-1 gene was transformed into Escherichia coli strains HB101 and DH5 alpha via a plasmid vector.\r"

  ".W": "A theoretical analysis of the reptational motion of DNA in a gel that includes the effects of molecular fluctuations has been used to explain the main features found in experiments involving periodic inversion of the electric field. The resonance-like decrease of the electrophoretic mobility as a function of pulse duration is related to transient \"undershoots\" in the orientation of the molecule, in agreement with recent experimental data. These features arise from a delicate interplay of internal and center of mass motion of the molecules under pulsed field conditions, and are important for the separation of DNA molecules in the size range 0.2 to 10 million base pairs.\r"

  ".W": "A secretory immune response to the carcinogen 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was elicited in rabbits by directly immunizing the small intestine with an AAF-cholera toxin conjugate. High-titer, high-affinity secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody to AAF was secreted into the intestinal lumen in response to this immunogen. Immune secretions reduced the transepithelial absorption of a 125I-labeled derivative of AAF by more than half. This reduction of absorption by hapten-specific IgA suggests that oral vaccines against carcinogens and toxicants could be developed for humans.\r"

This disorder, like infantile Tay-Sachs disease, is more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A point mutation in the alpha-chain gene was identified that results in the substitution of Gly with Ser in eight Ashkenazi adult GM2 gangliosidosis patients from five different families. This amino acid substitution was shown to depress drastically the catalytic activity of the alpha chain after expression in COS-1 cells. All of these patients proved to be compound heterozygotes of the allele with the Gly to Ser change and one of the two Ashkenazi infantile Tay-Sachs alleles. These findings will aid in the diagnosis and understanding of beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency disorders.\r"

Immunohistochemistry was used to localize p35 to a raphe of primitive glial ependymal cells in the median one-third of the floor plate in the central nervous system (CNS) of rat embryos. The p35 appears by embryonic day 12 before the arrival of pioneering ventral commissural axons. The unexpected, discrete distribution of this protein during development opens the question of its role in neural morphogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "A visual analog to binaural unmasking was explored. The observer's task was to detect, under stereoscopic viewing conditions, an apertured sinusoidal grating added to a square patch of visual noise. In the experimental condition, the square patch of noise was presented within a frame such that the right-eye noise was a shifted version of the left-eye noise. Because of the disparity in the noise images, subjects perceived, under stereoscopic viewing conditions, that the noise patch was located behind the frame. When sinusoidal signals were added to this noise patch, the signals were clearly more detectable when the signal disparity was zero than when the signal disparity equaled that of the noise patch, demonstrating the existence of visual unmasking. Hence, under appropriate circumstances, binocular processing, in addition to providing information about depth, can also enhance the detectability of visual patterns.\r"

Contrary to its metabolically inert appearance, this peptide may have biological activity. To evaluate this possibility, a peptide ligand homologous to the first 28 residues of the beta-amyloid protein (beta 1-28) was tested in cultures of hippocampal pyramidal neurons for neurotrophic or neurotoxic effects. The beta 1-28 appeared to have neurotrophic activity because it enhanced neuronal survival under the culture conditions examined. This finding may help elucidate the sequence of events leading to plaque formation and neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors are needed to determine whether control of angiogenesis would be therapeutic. Heparin and certain steroids, administered together, can inhibit angiogenesis in a synergistic manner. This \"pair\" effect suggested that specific hydrophilic cycloamyloses may be suitable heparin substitutes. beta-Cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate administered with a steroid inhibits angiogenesis at 100 to 1000 times the effectiveness of heparin in the chick embryo bioassay. This cyclic oligosaccharide also augments the anti-angiogenic effect of angiostatic steroids against corneal neovascularization in rabbits when beta-cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate and a steroid are inserted into the cornea or applied topically as eyedrops.\r"

Cells expressing wild-type protein lost ODC activity with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. Cells expressing the truncated protein, however, retained full activity for at least 4 hours. Pulse-chase experiments in which immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis were used confirmed the stabilizing effect of the truncation. Thus, a carboxyl-terminal domain is responsible for the rapid intracellular degradation of murine ODC.\r"
