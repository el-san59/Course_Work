For patients with neuroblastoma, conventional methods of surveillance are not sensitive enough. Because tumor cells are shed into the circulation, immunocytologic analysis of blood may function as a sensitive monitoring system. In this study, five blood samples were obtained from two patients with disseminated neuroblastoma at diagnosis and during therapy. These samples were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase staining to determine whether circulating neuroblasts were present. In both patients, the presence or absence of circulating neuroblasts yielded information that was more sensitive than that from conventional tests. The authors conclude that immunocytologic analysis of blood should be included with conventional monitoring methods for surveillance of patients with disseminated neuroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare neoplasm, but it is occurring with increased frequency even among apparently immunocompetent patients. Although secondary malignancies frequently involve the lymphoreticular system, PCNSL has been reported as a second neoplasm only once previously. Seven patients are discussed who developed PCNSL after successful treatment for a prior neoplasm. The original cancer was colon (one), breast (one), thyroid (one), Hodgkin's disease (two), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two). Patients with systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were thought to have a separate cerebral lymphoma on the basis of a prolonged disease-free interval from their systemic lymphoma, and the absence of systemic disease, when PCNSL was diagnosed and through subsequent follow-up. The PCNSL developed a median of 10 years after the diagnosis of the first tumor and 6 years after the last evidence of systemic disease. The diagnosis of PCNSL was often delayed because of confusion with brain metastases, and initial shrinkage or disappearance of the lesion after corticosteroids. Formation of PCNSL may be a consequence of treatment for the first malignancy, reflect an unidentified inherent predisposition to neoplastic transformation, or result from the changing epidemiology of PCNSL in the general population. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and a single hypothesis cannot account for all these cases.\r"

Residents of the rural area were twice as likely to have unstaged cancers (18.3%) as were urban residents (9.6%).

The relative excess of nonlocalized malignancies in rural Georgia was 21% for whites and 37% for blacks. The rural excess of nonlocalized prostate cancer among blacks was especially pronounced. Differences in access to or utilization of early detection methods may contribute to the rural-urban differential in the extent of disease at diagnosis.\r"

Significantly more cancers were observed in high-risk family members during this decade than were expected (P less than 0.001). The age of ovarian cancer diagnosis was studied in additional ovarian cancer-prone families of three types: site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome, the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome, and Lynch syndrome II. The age of onset in each of the three sets was significantly (P less than 0.001) earlier than the general population mean of 59, and there were significant differences in the age of onset (P = 0.050) among these three cohorts. Ovarian cancer histology was similar to that of patients with negative family histories. There may be clinically significant heterogeneity in the age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer among these ovarian cancer-prone syndromes. This has important implications for understanding its natural history and targeting surveillance-management strategies.\r"

Singlet oxygen and superoxide were generated by the photoactivation of rose bengal. Single ventricular cells exposed to rose bengal (10-100 nM) exhibited spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations at plateau potentials and at the level of the resting membrane potential. The voltage fluctuations induced in the resting potential occasionally triggered repetitive action potential discharges. At the resting membrane potential, the magnitude and dominant frequency of the voltage fluctuations were 1-3 mV and 1.5 Hz, respectively. At plateau potentials, the amplitude of the voltage fluctuations was about 2-5 mV, and the dominant oscillatory frequency was 2.6 Hz. In voltage-clamp experiments, transient inward currents were induced on repolarization after a depolarizing clamp step. Oscillatory currents also occurred occasionally during clamp steps to positive potentials. The peak frequencies of transient inward currents recorded at -20 and -70 mV were approximately 3.7 and 2.3 Hz, respectively, indicating that these currents may underlie the arrhythmogenic membrane potential fluctuations observed in current-clamp experiments. The rose bengal-induced transient inward currents were shown to be dependent on the magnitude and duration of the preceding voltage step. Studies of the voltage dependence of transient inward currents showed that these currents remained inward even at positive potentials (+30 mV), and replacement of extracellular sodium with lithium decreased transient inward current to approximately 10% of its initial value. Thus, the major component of oxidant stress-induced inward current appears to be electrogenic Na-Ca exchange. This oscillatory transient inward current may be responsible for the arrhythmias induced in isolated hearts exposed to reactive oxygen intermediates, and since oxidant stress has been implicated in reperfusion injury, it is possible that similar oscillatory currents may underlie reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.\r"

To elucidate mechanisms related to this reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of atherosclerosis, the acetylcholine-induced release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) was assessed functionally as a percent relaxation of the precontracted detector strips obtained from the tunica media beneath the intact intima or the atheromatous plaque in the same aortic ring preparation. Relaxations of the normal detectors to effluents containing EDRF of thoracic aortas during stimulation by acetylcholine (3 x 10(-6) M) in heterozygous and homozygous WHHL rabbits were 73 +/- 5% and 59 +/- 9% (p less than 0.01) of the phenylephrine-induced precontraction, respectively. Relaxations of the atherosclerotic detectors to effluents (EDRF) through the aortas during stimulation by acetylcholine (3 x 10(-6) M) in heterozygous and homozygous WHHL rabbits were 16 +/- 4% and 14 +/- 5%, respectively--values significantly smaller than those seen in the normal detectors. When superoxide dismutase was added to the perfusate of the donors from homozygous and heterozygous WHHL rabbits, atherosclerotic detectors relaxed by effluents stimulated by acetylcholine to 73% and 65% (p less than 0.01 versus before the addition of superoxide dismutase) of the normal detector, respectively. Relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside as well as the contractions by acetylcholine, phenylephrine, and KCl (118 mM) were comparable in detector strips from the normal and atherosclerotic portions. Thus, not only is the amount of EDRF released by acetylcholine reduced in the presence of atherosclerosis, the tunica media beneath the atheromatous plaque is also to some extent responsible for the superoxide-induced inactivation of EDRF.\r"

WKY and SHRSP underwent clipping of one carotid artery at 1 month of age. At 10-12 months of age, mechanics of pial arterioles were examined in vivo in anesthetized rats. Bilateral craniotomies were performed to expose pial arterioles in the sham and clipped cerebral hemispheres. Stress-strain relations were calculated from measurements of pial arteriolar pressure (servo null), diameter, and cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall. Point counting stereology was used to quantitate individual components in the arteriolar wall. Before deactivation of smooth muscle with EDTA, mean (Pm) and pulse (Pp) pressures were significantly less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in WKY (Pm, 63 +/- 2 versus 73 +/- 2 mm Hg; Pp, 23 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 3 mm Hg) and SHRSP (Pm, 94 +/- 4 versus 110 +/- 4 mm Hg; Pp, 27 +/- 2 versus 38 +/- 3 mm Hg). Cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall was less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in both groups of rats (1,403 +/- 125 versus 1,683 +/- 125 microns2 in WKY; 1,436 +/- 72 versus 1,926 +/- 134 microns2 in SHRSP). There was a correlation between cross-sectional area of the vessel wall and pulse pressure (r2 = 0.66), but not mean pressure (r2 = 0.09). During maximal dilatation with EDTA, the stress-strain curve was shifted to the left in clipped arterioles of SHRSP, but not of WKY, which indicates that carotid clipping in SHRSP reduces passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles. The proportion of distensible components in the vessel wall (smooth muscle, elastin, and endothelium) was reduced in clipped arterioles in SHRSP, but not in WKY. These findings suggest that 1) vascular hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles is related more closely to pulse pressure than to mean pressure, and 2) reduction of pial arteriolar pressure completely prevents cerebral vascular hypertrophy and attenuates increases in passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP.\r"

Because the constrictor effects of PGD2 in some vascular beds may be mediated through thromboxane receptors, the purpose of this study was to determine whether the vascular or bronchial effects of PGD2 are mediated through thromboxane/endoperoxide (TX/E) receptor activation. In chronically instrumented awake sheep, PGD2 (5-25 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced a dose-dependent increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and in systemic arterial blood pressure. These changes were due to increases in resistance, because cardiac output remained unchanged. PGD2 also decreased dynamic compliance at lower doses (0.1-5 micrograms/kg i.v.) than those required to produce pulmonary vasoconstriction, confirming that PGD2 is a potent bronchoconstrictor. The airway and systemic vascular effects of PGD2 were not altered by TX/E receptor antagonism. In contrast, PGD2-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was blocked by two TX/E receptor antagonists, SQ-29,548 and AH-23848, implying that this effect is mediated through activation of TX/E receptors. The pulmonary vasoconstrictor effects of PGD2 could not be explained by thromboxane generation, because neither cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen nor thromboxane synthase inhibition with OKY-046 had any effect on PGD2 actions. In contrast, a mild but consistent pulmonary vasodilation produced by PGD2 could be uncovered if the pulmonary vascular bed was preconstricted by hypoxia with simultaneous TX/E receptor blockade. These results indicate that TX/E receptor antagonists, although still useful pharmacological probes to determine the role of TX/E receptor activation in pathophysiological processes, should not be used to infer a role of endogenous thromboxane A2. It is possible that PGD2 participates in pulmonary processes previously ascribed uniquely to thromboxane A2.\r"

  ".W": "The objective of this study was to determine whether myogenic tone in the cerebral circulation can be modified by agents that interact with protein kinase C (PKC), a modulator of intracellular calcium sensitivity. Pial arteries (194 +/- 8 microns at 125 mm Hg) were isolated from Wistar-Kyoto rats and mounted on glass microcannulas in a specialized arteriograph. Simultaneous recordings of transmural pressure and lumen diameter were made with a video-electronic system. Myogenic tone, which developed at transmural pressures above 50 mm Hg, reduced lumen diameter by 29 +/- 3%, to 136 +/- 5 microns. Staurosporine (a PKC inhibitor) or indolactam (a PKC activator) was added cumulatively to segments of arteries obtained from each animal. Staurosporine induced progressive and eventually complete dilation, with half-maximal inhibition of myogenic tone occurring at a concentration of 1.32 +/- 0.10 nM. Conversely, indolactam augmented basal tone, reducing diameter by a maximum of 62 +/- 3%, with half-maximal effects at 0.4 +/- 1.0 microM. The effects of indolactam on arterial responses to acute increases in transmural pressure were also determined to test whether this dynamic and possibly separate mechanism could be potentiated by PKC stimulation. Although basal tone was augmented, diameter responses to increased pressure were not altered. In summary, these results implicate PKC in the regulation of basal myogenic tone and resistance artery caliber, which is a major determinant of blood flow. PKC modulation did not affect diameter responses to sudden changes in transmural pressure, however, suggesting the existence of a separate sensing/transduction mechanism that has yet to be identified.\r"

  ".U": "91121632\r", 
  ".W": "The myocardium is a complex three-dimensional structure consisting of myocytes interconnected by a dense collagen weave that courses in different directions. Regional ischemia can be expected to produce complex changes in ventricular deformation. In the present study, we examined the effects of ischemia on two- and three-dimensional finite strains during acute transmural myocardial ischemia in 13 open-chest anesthetized dogs. In contrast to systolic deformation observed during the control period in which circumferential shortening exceeded longitudinal shortening, our results indicate that after 5 minutes of acute ischemia, end-systolic in-plane lengthening across the left ventricular wall occurs in approximately equal amounts in the circumferential and longitudinal directions. Along with these changes in extensional strains, there were significant negative transverse shearing deformations during ischemia. Myocardial ischemia also resulted in a loss of the normal end-systolic transmural gradients of shortening and thickening. Three-dimensional end-diastolic strains indicate that the left ventricular wall undergoes a significant passive reconfiguration that varies transmurally with lengthening in the epicardial tangent plane and wall thinning increasing from the epicardium toward the endocardium. The large systolic changes in shearing deformations with ischemia could potentially influence collateral blood flow and certainly indicate that uniaxial measurements of deformation in the ischemic myocardium, which do not account for shearing deformation, are incomplete and must be interpreted with caution. Moreover, normal transmural systolic gradients in deformation, which would be anticipated on geometric grounds, are lost during ischemia, implying that the material properties of ischemic tissue or the loading conditions imposed on the ischemic region by partially impaired adjacent myocardium vary transmurally.\r"

  ".W": "Several recent reports have indicated that catecholamines may act directly on the crossbridge cycle, independent of intracellular calcium concentration changes. The present study investigated the effect of isoproterenol on peak force during twitches at constant sarcomere length and unloaded velocity of sarcomere shortening in isolated right ventricular trabeculae of hearts with V1 or V3 isomyosin obtained from euthyroid and hypothyroid rats, respectively. Hypothyroidism was induced by treatment of the rats with propylthiouracil for 6 weeks. Electrophoretic analysis showed that the hearts of hypothyroid animals were composed only of V3 isomyosin, whereas the hearts of euthyroid animals were composed predominantly of V1 isomyosin. Force development was measured with a silicon strain gauge and sarcomere length with laser diffraction techniques; the shortening velocity was determined from contractions in which sarcomere length was initially held constant followed by a quick release to zero load and a controlled release at zero load. Both isometric twitch force and unloaded sarcomere shortening velocity were sigmoidal functions of [Ca2+]o and of the concentration of isoproterenol. At optimal [Ca2+]o, unloaded shortening velocity was 40% lower in myocardium of hypothyroid animals than in myocardium of euthyroid animals. Isoproterenol increased the sensitivity of isometric twitch force and unloaded shortening velocity to [Ca2+]o in trabeculae from both euthyroid and hypothyroid animals. Isoproterenol did not increase unloaded shortening velocity at optimal [Ca2+]o, regardless of the thyroid state. From these results we conclude that beta-adrenergic stimulation per se does not accelerate the rate limiting step in the crossbridge cycle that determines unloaded sarcomere shortening velocity in the intact cardiac cell.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the \"vascular waterfall\" hypothesis, which proposes that coronary flow is unaffected by elevations in outflow pressure until the latter reaches a critical threshold level, in 29 isolated canine hearts. In fibrillating hearts vasodilated with adenosine or carbocromen, coronary flow and the coronary pressure-flow relation were not affected by changes in great cardiac vein pressure (PGCV) below a threshold value of 11 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg. Further elevations of PGCV reduced flow and shifted the pressure-flow relation to the right, increasing its pressure-axis intercept (Pf=0). When vasomotor tone was augmented with vasopressin, threshold PGCV increased to 25 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Once again, the pressure-flow relation was unaffected by changes in PGCV below the threshold value and shifted to the right when this value was exceeded. The amount by which spontaneous values of Pf=0 exceeded threshold values of PGCV was greater when vasomotor tone was augmented than during vasodilation. Pf=0 continued to exceed PGCV when the latter was raised above the threshold level. Both Pf=0 and threshold values of PGCV were less during a long diastole than during ventricular fibrillation. We reached the following conclusions. 1) During changes in PGCV below a threshold value, the coronary circulation exhibits traditional waterfall behavior. 2) The threshold pressure for altering waterfall behavior is affected by vascular tone and mechanical activity. 3) Pf=0 remains above PGCV when the latter is increased above the threshold value needed to alter flow.\r"

  ".U": "91121635\r", 
  ".W": "Contractile dysfunction has been demonstrated in many previous studies of experimental right ventricular pressure-overload hypertrophy; however, given the complex changes that occur both in the cardiac muscle cell and in the multiple components of the cardiac interstitium, it is not clear whether the contractile dysfunction observed is an intrinsic property of the cardiac muscle cell or whether it is the result of a mechanically normal cardiac muscle cell contracting within an abnormal interstitial environment. The purpose of the present study was to examine the contractile behavior of cardiac muscle cells, or cardiocytes, isolated from seven cat right ventricles that were pressure-overloaded by banding the pulmonary artery; right ventricular cardiocytes from seven sham-operated cats served as controls. Cardiocytes were obtained from these cats via standard cell isolation procedures; contractile function of the cardiocytes in response to graded viscous external loads was defined by laser diffraction. The cells were stimulated to contract at a frequency of 0.25 Hz, using 100-microA direct current pulses of alternating polarity. Hypertrophied right ventricular cardiocytes obtained from banded cats showed marked systolic contractile abnormalities in comparison with right ventricular cardiocytes from sham-operated cats. The peak velocity of sarcomere shortening for the control and hypertrophied cardiocytes in 1-cp superfusate was 3.6 +/- 0.2 and 2.1 +/- 0.1 microns/sec, respectively (p less than 0.001); the maximum extent of sarcomere shortening for the control and hypertrophied cardiocytes was 0.21 +/- 0.01 and 0.14 +/- 0.01 microns, respectively (p less than 0.001). Further, the time to peak shortening in the 1-cp superfusate was significantly longer for the hypertrophied cardiocytes (150.1 +/- 3.3 versus 160.4 +/- 3.7 msec; p less than 0.04). When the relengthening properties of the cells were examined in the 1-cp superfusate, there were significant differences between cardiocyte groups. The peak rate of sarcomere relengthening was 3.5 +/- 0.2 microns/sec in the control cardiocytes and 2.2 +/- 0.17 microns/sec in the hypertrophied cardiocytes (p less than 0.001). Similarly, the time to peak velocity of sarcomere relengthening (48.8 +/- 1.8 versus 57.9 +/- 2.9 msec) and the time to 50% maximal sarcomere relengthening (57.1 +/- 3.1 versus 67.1 +/- 3.1 msec) were both significantly prolonged for the hypertrophied cardiocytes (p less than 0.02). This study shows for the first time that the contractile defect in this model of right ventricular pressure-overload hypertrophy is intrinsic to the cardiac muscle cell itself. This finding provides a basis for further, more focused investigations designed to determine the mechanisms responsible for the contractile dysfunction observed in this form of experimental cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

The membrane properties of the cells were assessed using the patch-electrode voltage-clamp technique, and cell viability was monitored using fluorescein diacetate uptake. Exposure of the cells to oxyhemoglobin (5 microM) resulted in 1) contraction, 2) the appearance of membrane blebs, 3) an increase in the outward potassium currents, 4) a decrease in the membrane resistance, and 5) cell death. In contrast, no effect of oxyhemoglobin on cultured murine neuroblastoma cells was observed. Methemoglobin (100 microM) had no effects on the smooth muscle cells. Catalase (300 units/ml) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.5%) protected against the effects of oxyhemoglobin; superoxide dismutase (100-1,000 units/ml) provided only partial protection. Exposure of the cells to superoxide anions generated by xanthine (1 mM) plus xanthine oxidase (10 units/l) or to hydrogen peroxide (500 microM) caused an increase in the outward potassium currents without affecting membrane resistance. Generation of hydroxyl radicals by metal ions plus hydrogen peroxide caused the same effects as oxyhemoglobin, that is, an increase in the potassium currents, followed by a decrease in the membrane resistance and cell death. In conclusion, it appears that oxyhemoglobin exerts its effects on vascular smooth muscle cells by the generation of free radicals, chiefly hydroxyl radicals.\r"

High concentrations of intracellular calcium buffer prevented the current, isoproterenol increased it, and cadmium, nisoldipine, ryanodine, or caffeine blocked it. These data are consistent with a current that is calcium activated, by the calcium transient that causes contraction. The current was not blocked by external 4-aminopyridine or tetraethylammonium, and it was still present if external potassium was omitted and internal potassium was replaced by cesium. The current was absent when intracellular and extracellular chloride concentrations were drastically reduced, even when intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations were normal. The current was blocked by the anion transport blockers 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and responded to extracellular chloride changes as expected for a chloride current. We used SITS and DIDS to define the voltage dependence of the transient outward current. The current first appeared at voltages positive to the threshold of the calcium current and declined as voltage approached the calcium reversal potential. Tail-current experiments suggested that the current rectified strongly in the outward direction. We propose that the 4-aminopyridine-resistant transient outward current of rabbit ventricular myocytes is a calcium-activated chloride current.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that, during refractory period stimulation, sarcolemmal hyperpolarization by the first pulse of biphasic waveforms facilitates excitation channel recovery, which enhances graded responses produced by the second depolarizing pulse. This prolongs cellular refractoriness to fibrillation wavefronts when compared with a monophasic depolarizing stimulus. Monophasic (10 msec, rectangular wave) or symmetrical biphasic (10 msec, each pulse) current injection S2 stimuli at 1.5 and two times S1 threshold were used to scan the S1 action potential refractory period (S1 cycle length, 600 msec) in myocardial cell aggregates. S2 waveforms were delivered with normal and reversed polarity to test the hyperpolarizing action of biphasic waveforms. Responses to an S3 stimulus, which simulated a potential incoming fibrillation wavefront, were also determined. Results showed that biphasic S2 waveforms produced longer graded responses during and immediately after the S1 refractory period than did corresponding monophasic S2 waveforms. The maximum difference in response duration produced by the biphasic and monophasic waveforms was 58.6 +/- 10.0 msec (p less than 0.001). This maximum difference occurred 10 msec before the end of the S1 refractory period. The longer response durations produced by biphasic S2 also produced longer refractoriness to the S3 stimulus. The maximum difference in total refractoriness to S3 of 51.8 +/- 2.8 msec (p less than 0.002) occurred at the same S1S2 coupling interval as the maximum difference in S2 response duration. Prolonged refractoriness may protect ventricular cells from refibrillation wavefronts and act as the cellular basis for greater biphasic waveform defibrillation efficacy.\r"

Angiotensin II (AII) was infused by osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks in 4.5-month-old rats. Group A received AII (200 ng/min) 2 weeks after a balloon catheter-induced injury of the thoracic aorta and left common carotid artery. Group B received only AII, group C only balloon denudation, and group D neither balloon injury nor AII. During the AII or Ringer's solution infusion, all animals received [3H]thymidine via a second minipump to measure DNA synthesis. AII increased the systolic pressure by more than 40 mm Hg. AII significantly increased DNA synthesis in the media of the carotid artery from 0.2 +/- 0.2% in group C to 2.5 +/- 1.5% in group A (mean +/- SD, n = 5 or 6). DNA synthesis in the neointima of the carotid artery significantly increased with AII from 4.8 +/- 4.2% in group C to 19.8 +/- 13.9% in group A. Cross-sectional area of the neointima almost doubled during AII infusion, and it increased approximately 25% in the media. Comparable results were obtained in the aorta. In a second experiment, AII was infused (125 ng/min) for 2 weeks in 11-week-old rats. Concomitantly, [3H]thymidine was given. Control rats received Ringer's solution and [3H]thymidine in their pumps.

Our aim was to specifically inhibit myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in the presence of physiologically activating levels of Ca2+ so that other putative Ca2(+)-dependent regulatory systems could be unmasked. Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules obtained from goats immunized with turkey gizzard MLCK. Anti-MLCK Fab was then purified by chromatography on an MLCK-Sepharose 4B column. These affinity-purified Fab fragments inhibit the activity of MLCK purified from turkey gizzard smooth muscle and interact monospecifically with MLCK in various mammalian smooth muscles as demonstrated by a Western blot analysis. The effect of these Fab fragments on the contractile properties was tested in guinea pig taenia coli made permeable (skinned) using Triton X-100. Skinned fibers, approximately 100 microns in diameter and 4 mm long, were mounted for isometric measurements and immersed in calcium-EGTA buffers. Fibers preincubated with anti-MLCK Fab in relaxing solution (Ca2+ less than 1 nM) for 75 minutes developed about 25% of the isometric force of a parallel control contraction when transferred to contracting solution (Ca2+ = 0.5 microM). When added to contracting solution at the peak of a contracture, anti-MLCK Fab elicited a relaxation that was complete in about 120 minutes despite the presence of Ca2+. No significant effect on isometric force was observed when fibers were incubated with another affinity-purified mouse Fab raised against the Fc region of human IgG (control Fab).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We simulated myocardial perfusion conditions during evolving myocardial infarction in isolated, normothermic, isovolumic rabbit hearts perfused with buffer containing bovine red blood cells (hematocrit of 40%), and we assessed the effects of high levels of glucose and insulin as \"therapy\" during prolonged (150-minute) severe underperfusion and reperfusion. Protocol 1 consisted of underperfusion at a constant coronary perfusion pressure of 8 mm Hg. The control group (n = 8) received 5.5 mmol/l glucose and 15 microunits/ml insulin; the group treated with high levels of glucose and insulin (G + I) (n = 8) received 19.5 mmol/l glucose and 250 microunits/ml insulin during both underperfusion and reperfusion. Relative to the control group, the G + I group experienced 1) greater developed pressure during underperfusion and increased recovery during reperfusion, 2) preserved diastolic function during underperfusion and reperfusion, 3) lower coronary resistance and greater coronary flow during the underperfusion period, 4) increased glycolytic flux and preserved glycogen stores and high energy phosphate levels, and 5) less loss of myocyte enzymes (creatine kinase and alanine aminotransferase). In protocol 2, coronary flow was kept identical in control (n = 8) and G + I hearts (n = 8) during the underperfusion period, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was kept below 10 mm Hg in both groups to minimize subendocardial damage and vascular compression. In this protocol, the effect of the G + I intervention in the prevention of an increase in coronary resistance during the underperfusion period was distinguished from its myocellular metabolic effects; the high G + I substrate had protective effects on mechanical and metabolic function that were less marked than, but similar to, those in protocol 1, indicating that its mechanisms of protection during underperfusion affected both cardiac function and coronary resistance. We conclude that the G + I intervention, in clinically relevant concentrations, markedly protected severely underperfused myocardium for 150 minutes and may be a beneficial intervention in combination with reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction.\r"

During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency.\r"

  ".W": "This study describes factors that contribute to spontaneous termination of reentry lasting one to 10 cycles after induction by a single premature stimulus. Reentry was studied in vitro in rings of canine atrial tissue from around the tricuspid valve orifice. Activation was recorded from a circular array of 10 extracellular bipolar electrodes equally spaced around the ring. In some experiments, transmembrane or monophasic action potential recordings were made near critical sites. Termination of reentry within one cycle after induction was recorded 110 times in 11 of 35 experiments. Important factors contributing to termination were 1) an obligatory reversal of the activation sequence that resulted in a long coupling interval in the critical region beyond the site of unidirectional block after the premature stimulus and 2) much longer refractory periods limited to this critical region, which facilitated unidirectional block but contributed to termination when this region was first activated with a short coupling interval at the end of the first reentrant cycle. Termination of nonsustained reentry lasting longer than one cycle resulted from oscillations of conduction and refractoriness initiated by the abrupt shortening of cycle length after initiation of reentry. Oscillations of conduction resulted from interval-dependent conduction of reentrant impulses that encountered partially refractory tissue. For reentry to become sustained, the oscillations after induction of reentry must dampen. Thus, damped cycle length oscillations after induction may identify clinical tachycardias caused by reentry with a partially excitable gap.\r"

In the present study, human neutrophil leukotriene generation was provoked by an anti-5b immunoglobulin G, isolated from a multiparous donor plasma that caused noncardiogenic lung edema during transfusion therapy. In 5b-positive polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the antibody stimulated marked arachidonic acid metabolism, dependent on the presence of plasma as the complement source. Quantity and profile of lipid mediators (leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4) corresponded to those repeatedly described after PMN in vitro stimulation with the artificial calcium ionophore A23187. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs sequestered in the microvasculature of perfused rabbit lungs did, however, induce a markedly modified metabolite profile. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4 were not detected, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was markedly reduced. In contrast, cysteinyl leukotrienes were measured as predominant compounds, with rapid appearance of leukotriene C4 and more protracted generation of leukotriene E4. Leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products were released with similar kinetics, but in lower amounts, as compared with the isolated PMN stimulation. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs coincubated with pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro, but not stimulation of either cell type alone, provoked marked generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. These findings suggest modulation of PMN 5-lipoxygenase metabolism in favor of leukotriene A4 transfer to adjacent acceptor cells with subsequent enzymatic conversion to cysteinyl leukotrienes under conditions of lung vascular sequestration. Endothelial cells appear to serve as predominant cooperative cells under circumstances of blood-free lung perfusion. PMN-related transcellular eicosanoid synthesis may be involved in the pathogenesis of transfusion-evoked acute lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "We have found that when suprathreshold cathodal stimuli were applied to the epicardium of canine ventricle, impulse propagation originated at a \"virtual cathode\" with dimensions greater than those of the physical cathode. We report the two-dimensional geometry of the virtual cathode as a function of stimulus strength; the results are compared with the predictions of an anisotropic, bidomain model of cardiac conduction recently developed in our laboratories. Data were collected in six pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs by using a small plaque electrode sewn to the left ventricular epicardium. Arrival times at closely spaced bipolar electrodes oriented radially around a central cathode were obtained as a function of stimulus strength and fiber orientation. The dimensions of the virtual cathode were determined by linear back-extrapolation of arrival times to the time of stimulation. The directional dependence of the conduction velocity was consistent with previous reports: at 1 mA, longitudinal (0 degree) and transverse (90 degrees) velocities were 0.60 +/- 0.03 and 0.29 +/- 0.02 m/sec, respectively. At 7 mA, the longitudinal velocity was 0.75 +/- 0.05 m/sec, whereas there was no significant change in the transverse velocity. In contrast to conduction velocity, the virtual cathode was smallest in the longitudinal orientation and largest between 45 degrees and 60 degrees. Virtual cathode size was dependent on both orientation and stimulus strength: at 0 degree, the virtual cathode was small (approximately 1 mm) and relatively constant over the range of 1-7 mA; at oblique orientations (45 degrees-90 degrees), it displayed a roughly logarithmic dependence on stimulus strength, approximately 1 mm at 1 mA and approximately 3 mm at 7 mA. The bidomain, anisotropic model reproduced both the stimulus strength and the fiber-orientation dependence of the virtual cathode geometry when the intracellular and extracellular anisotropies were 10:1 and 4:1, respectively, but not when the two anisotropies were equal. We suggest that the virtual cathode provides a direct measure of the determinants of cardiac activation; its complex geometry appears to reflect the bidomain, anisotropic nature of cardiac muscle.\r"

LV end-systolic stress was increased early (p less than 0.01) but was normalized later. The LV end-systolic stress-volume relation demonstrated an enhanced contractile response to norepinephrine during developing hypertension, which returned toward control later in the course of stable hypertension. The LV dP/dt responses to norepinephrine (0.4 microgram/kg/min) were significantly greater during developing hypertension (7,509 +/- 337 mm Hg/sec, p less than 0.05) compared with the control period (4,737 +/- 286 mm Hg/sec) and returned toward the control value during stable hypertension (5,168 +/- 465 mm Hg/sec). The enhanced inotropic responses to norepinephrine in developing hypertension were preserved in the presence of ganglionic blockade, suggesting that the augmentation was not mediated via reflex mechanisms. These physiological responses were associated with an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density, but no significant change in basal or maximal adenylate cyclase stimulation occurred during developing hypertension. Thus, in contrast to prior studies in anesthetized animals, the inotropic response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is not depressed in conscious dogs but is enhanced selectively during the development of hypertension and maintained during stable hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of developing perinephritic hypertension (2-3 weeks) and a more stable period of perinephritic hypertension (approximately 14 weeks) were examined on indexes of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs. The complete period of diastole was studied using indexes of isovolumic relaxation (tau), early filling (LV +dD/dt), and stiffness (myocardial stiffness and chamber stress/diameter ratio). During developing hypertension, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic stress, peak filling rate, myocardial stiffness, and the stress/diameter ratio increased (p less than 0.05); the time constant tau was not changed. These changes were associated with preserved baseline levels of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres) but an impaired coronary vasodilator response to adenosine. Acute administration of phenylephrine in the normotensive dogs caused increases in systolic and diastolic stress and resulted in increases in myocardial stiffness and in the stress/diameter ratio similar to values observed in developing hypertension. During stable hypertension, LV end-diastolic stress, peak filling rate, and both parameters of late-diastolic function (myocardial stiffness and stress/diameter ratio) returned toward control values, but the isovolumic relaxation time constant was increased. Quantitative histological evaluation revealed no increase in stainable connective tissue in dogs with stable hypertension compared with control dogs, and hydroxyproline concentration was not increased in the subendomyocardium, midmyocardium, or subepimyocardium of the dogs with chronic perinephritic hypertension. Thus, in developing hypertension, major alterations in diastolic function were observed that were not structurally related, since these changes 1) could be induced in normal dogs by increasing preload and afterload acutely with phenylephrine and 2) were improved during the ensuing stable period of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the contractile response of isolated rabbit middle cerebral artery (MCA) segments to electrical field stimulation (EFS). The dynamics of the EFS contraction were compared with a similar-sized branch of rabbit ear artery. In comparison with the ear artery, the EFS contractions of the MCA displayed a longer latency and a higher stimulus frequency threshold. Greater stimulation train lengths were required to attain equilibrium, and the time course of EFS response--including force development, plateau, and return to rest tension--was significantly slower than in the ear artery. Morphological and pharmacological studies of the MCA showed that it receives sympathetic adrenergic innervation: whole-mount preparations displayed catecholamine histofluorescence; electron micrographs of MCA sections revealed a population of varicosities containing chromaffin positive large and small vesicles; and EFS contractions were blocked by tetrodotoxin (30 nM) and guanethidine (5 microM) and by chronic surgical sympathectomy. Exposure to prazosin (10 microM) or phenoxybenzamine (1 microM) blocked norepinephrine contractions but did not significantly influence the EFS contraction. Procedures and drugs that antagonized the responses to neuropeptide Y, serotonin, or histamine were also ineffective in blocking the EFS contraction. The involvement of ATP could not be assessed, since the purinergic P2 agonist alpha,beta-methylene ATP was ineffective in blocking ATP-mediated contractions. The EFS contraction, however, could be blocked by a combination of neuropeptide Y desensitization and phenoxybenzamine (30 nM) or prazosin (0.1 microM). These results suggest that norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y are released from sympathetic nerves and mediate EFS contraction by occupation of postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptor and neuropeptide Y receptors. Since the blockade of only one of these components does not diminish the response to EFS, the adrenergic neuroeffector system in this artery may involve complex prejunctional regulatory mechanisms.\r"

Metabolite content was assessed in tissue extracts by chemical analysis and in the whole heart by 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In ischemic hearts metabolizing either [3-13C]pyruvate or [1-13C]glucose, 1 mM INO increased both total and 13C-labeled alanine content; lactate content was unaffected. At 3 minutes of ischemia, tissue alanine was 1.81 +/- 0.11 microM/g wet wt (mean +/- SEM) in hearts perfused with pyruvate+INO versus 1.23 +/- 0.15 microM/g wet wt in hearts perfused with pyruvate alone (p less than 0.05). INO reduced tissue glycogen during ischemia in pyruvate-perfused hearts. Tissue alanine content in ischemic hearts that were supplied glucose+INO (1.29 +/- 0.13 microM/g wet wt) was greater than in ischemic hearts supplied glucose alone (0.65 +/- 0.14 microM/g wet wt). Alanine was found to originate from pyruvate and was a glycolytic end product in glucose-perfused hearts. INO raised the [3-13C]alanine/[3-13C]lactate ratio in ischemic, intact hearts (glucose = 0.24 +/- 0.07 versus glucose+INO = 0.60 +/- 0.09; pyruvate = 0.49 +/- 0.08 versus pyruvate+INO = 0.89 +/- 0.08). At 7 minutes of ischemia, ATP content fell to 70 +/- 3% with glucose+INO versus 58 +/- 5% with glucose alone. Rigor (stone heart) was delayed from 14.7 +/- 1.3 to 23.2 +/- 1.6 minutes with INO. INO did not change ATP content in ischemic hearts that were supplied pyruvate but delayed rigor (pyruvate = 9.9 +/- 1.2 minutes; pyruvate+INO = 15.6 +/- 1.0 minutes), possibly at the expense of glycogen. Supplemental glucose improved the effectiveness of INO with pyruvate to preserve ATP (pyruvate+glucose = 42 +/- 6%; pyruvate+glucose+INO = 72 +/- 6%) and further delayed rigor (pyruvate+glucose = 13.3 +/- 1.5 minutes; pyruvate+glucose+INO = 20.3 +/- 1.8 minutes). Glucose metabolism supported improved energetic and contractile states in ischemic hearts treated with INO. Thus, cardioprotection of the ischemic heart by INO was associated with preservation of functional integrity and improved energy production due to increased glycolytic activity. Activation of glycolysis in the presence of INO was accommodated by augmented alanine production without the additional accumulation of lactate.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of the present study was to describe sarcomere dynamics in thin trabeculae that were dissected from the right ventricle of kittens. The muscles were mounted in an experimental chamber and perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (25 degrees C). Sarcomere length (SL) was measured by laser diffraction techniques; force, by a silicon strain gauge; and velocity of sarcomere shortening, by the \"isovelocity release\" technique. Contractile activation was varied by changing the calcium concentration in the bathing medium ([Ca2+]o). Slack SL was 1.85 +/- 0.04 microns. When length of the muscle was held constant, the sarcomeres in the central region of the muscle shortened during the twitch by up to 21%. Both peak sarcomere isometric twitch force and unloaded velocity of sarcomere shortening (Vo) were a sigmoidal function of [Ca2+]o. Maximum Vo was 9.8 +/- 0.2 microns/sec; maximum sarcomere isometric twitch force was 108 +/- 13.8 mN/mm2. The shape of the force-SL relation was a function of [Ca2+]o. At [Ca2+]o = 1.5 mM, the force-SL relation was curved with its convexity toward the abscissa; at [Ca2+]o = 6 mM, the relation was curved with its convexity toward the ordinate. Vo depended in a linear manner on SL up to 2.2 microns at [Ca2+]o = 1.5 mM. At [Ca2+]o = 6.0 mM, Vo depended also linearly on SL below 1.85 microns but became nearly independent of SL above 1.85 microns. Vo rose exponentially with time into the twitch up to 200 msec and remained constant thereafter at least up to 300 msec. Force, on the other hand, peaked at about 300 msec. These results are comparable with those found in rat myocardium, although cat myocardium is less sensitive to [Ca2+]o and twitch kinetics are significantly slower than those in rat myocardium.\r"

In the resting papillary muscle of the guinea pig, (+/-)-sulmazole increased intracellular Na+ activity (aiNa) within 15-20 minutes by 0.5 +/- 0.1 (n = 3), 1.3 +/- 0.1 (n = 7), 2.7 +/- 0.2 (n = 6), and 4.9 +/- 0.5 (n = 6) mM at 60, 100, 300, and 1,000 microM, respectively.

In the contracting papillary muscle (0.2 Hz), (+)- and (+/-)-sulmazole (600 and 1,000 microM) produced a maximum positive inotropic effect that exceeded that of DHO by 11% and 8%, respectively. As an inotropic agent, (+)-sulmazole was almost twice as potent as the racemate. The maximum direct inotropic effect of (-)-sulmazole (1,000 microM) amounted to only 14% of the DHO maximum and was, in contrast to the racemate and (+)-sulmazole, antagonized by 3 microM carbachol.

Ninety minutes of ischemia followed by 5 hours of reperfusion, which resulted in myocardial necrosis of 43.9 +/- 4.0% of the area at risk, caused a 22% reduction in total myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 57% decrease in nonprotein myocardial SH groups (p less than 0.01), a 56% decrease in GSH (p less than 0.01), and a 62% decrease in non-GSH, nonprotein SH groups (p less than 0.02). However, protein SH groups were not significantly reduced (12% decrease, p = NS). Also, myocardial release of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into the coronary venous effluent occurred during early reperfusion. In contrast, 15 minutes of ischemia, followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, did not alter myocardial total SH groups, protein SH groups, or GSH (9% decrease, p = NS); nor was there reperfusion release of GSH or GSSG.

  ".W": "The endothelium plays a critical role in the control of vasomotor tone by the release of vasoactive substances. Because endothelial injury or dysfunction is considered important very early in atherogenesis, we hypothesized that abnormal endothelial function precedes the angiographic detection of coronary atherosclerosis in the human coronary circulation. The coronary vasomotor responses to three different endothelium-mediated stimuli (intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, increase in blood flow to induce flow-dependent dilation, and sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor testing) were assessed by quantitative angiography and subselective intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements within the left anterior descending coronary artery in 38 patients. All three stimuli elicited epicardial artery dilation in all 11 patients with smooth coronary arteries and absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease (group 1). All nine patients with smooth coronary arteries but with hypercholesterolemia (group 2) demonstrated a selective impairment in endothelial function with vasoconstriction (35 +/- 12.7% decrease in mean luminal area) in response to acetylcholine but showed a preserved flow-dependent dilation (15.5 +/- 4.4% increase in mean luminal area) and vasodilation in response to cold pressor testing (14.2 +/- 4.6% increase in mean luminal area). In all nine patients with an angiographically defined smooth coronary artery segment but with evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the coronary system (group 3), both acetylcholine and cold pressor testing induced vasoconstriction (26.2 +/- 8.7% and 18.7 +/- 7.9% decrease in mean luminal area, respectively), whereas flow-dependent dilation was preserved (20.4 +/- 8.7% increase in mean luminal area). In the nine patients with angiographic evidence of wall irregularities (group 4), flow-dependent dilation was also abolished and vasoconstriction occurred in response to acetylcholine and cold pressor testing (34.5 +/- 10.7% and 19.9 +/- 6.3% decrease in mean luminal area, respectively). All coronary artery segments dilated in response to nitroglycerin, suggesting preserved function of vascular smooth muscle. Despite similar reductions in coronary vascular resistance in response to the smooth muscle relaxant papaverin, patients with hypercholesterolemia demonstrated a selective impairment of vasodilation of the resistance vasculature in response to acetylcholine (p less than 0.05 versus groups 1, 3, and 4). Thus, there is a progressive impairment of endothelial vasoactive functioning in coronary arteries of patients with different early stages of atherosclerosis, beginning with a selective endothelial dysfunction in angiographically defined normal arteries in patients with hypercholesterolemia and progressively worsening to a complete loss of endothelium-mediated vasodilation in angiographically defined atherosclerotic coronary arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, responses of long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) to known endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine, calcium ionophore A23187, thrombin, and histamine, as well as authentic nitric oxide, the putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor, were studied. Sixteen CAGBs were isolated within 1-2 hours from hearts of 14 patients receiving a cardiac transplant. A total of 109 ring segments were prepared from these CABGs and studied in vitro. The duration of the CABGs ranged from 7 months to 12 years. Addition of acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1.0 microM), thrombin (0.01-1.0 unit/ml), and histamine (0.01-1.0 microM) consistently produced a dose- and endothelium-dependent relaxation, reaching a maximum of -35.3 +/- 3.3%, -45.3 +/- 5.5%, -26.9 +/- 4.8%, and -17.8 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. No significant difference was observed among the CABGs with different duration of transplantation, whereas the relaxant responses of different segments along the entire length of a CABG were markedly different. These latter differences in the endothelium-dependent responses appear to correlate inversely with the development of intimal proliferative lesions in these CABGs. Addition of nitric oxide (0.01-10 microM) produced a potent dose- and endothelium-independent relaxation, which was also slightly depressed in CABGs with severe intimal proliferation. These results demonstrate that long-term transplanted human saphenous vein grafts retain their endothelium-dependent responses and that development of severe intimal proliferative lesions, rather than the duration of the grafts, result in marked alterations in the reactivity of these transplanted CABGs.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis has been assessed previously by comparing the exercise test with a coronary arteriogram. The inherent inaccuracy of visually determined percent diameter stenosis measurements might have lead to the conclusion that the exercise electrocardiogram was less accurate than it truly was. To determine the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiography in detecting a physiologically significant coronary stenosis, we studied 40 patients with one-vessel, one-lesion coronary artery disease, a normal resting electrocardiogram, and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Each patient underwent exercise electrocardiography (Bruce protocol) that was interpreted as abnormal if the ST segment developed 0.1-mV or greater depression 80 msec after the J point. The physiological significance of each coronary stenosis was assessed by measuring of coronary flow reserve (peak divided by resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery using a Doppler catheter and intracoronary papaverine (normal, 3.5 or greater peak/resting velocity). The percent diameter and percent area stenosis produced by each lesion were determined using quantitative angiography (Brown/Dodge method). Of the 17 patients with reduced coronary flow reserve (3.5 or greater peak/resting blood flow velocity) in the stenotic artery, 14 had an abnormal exercise electrocardiogram (sensitivity, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.94). Conversely, 20 of 23 patients with normal coronary flow reserves had normal exercise tests (specificity, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.97). The exercise electrocardiogram was abnormal in each of 11 patients with markedly reduced coronary flow reserve (less than 2.5 peak/resting velocity) and in three of six patients with moderately reduced reserve (2.5-3.4 peak/resting velocity). The products of systolic blood pressure and heart rate at peak exercise were significantly correlated with coronary reserve in patients with truly abnormal exercise tests. In comparison, the sensitivity (0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.76) and specificity (0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.86) of exercise electrocardiography in detecting a 60% or greater diameter stenosis may be significantly lower (p less than 0.05). Exercise electrocardiography, therefore, was a good predictor of the physiological significance (assessed by coronary flow reserve) of a coronary stenosis in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram and no hypertrophy or prior infarction. Its value in a broader and larger patient population will require further study. These results, however, underscore the importance of a physiological gold standard in assessing the accuracy of noninvasive studies for detecting coronary artery disease.\r"

Different diet compositions were prescribed to enhance the differential in blood cholesterol responses between the two groups. The annual rate of change in computer-estimated atherosclerosis (CEA), a measure of lumen abnormality, was evaluated between treatment groups. A significant per-segment therapy effect was found in segments with moderately severe atherosclerosis (p less than 0.04) and in proximal segments (p less than 0.02). When segmental CEA measures were combined into a per-patient score using an adaptation of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute scoring procedure, a significant therapy effect was observed (p less than 0.02). Total variance of the annual change rate in CEA was as predicted from pilot studies, but measurement variation was larger. The therapy effect observed in femoral arteries, although significant, was less marked than the strong and consistent benefit previously reported for both native coronary arteries and aortocoronary bypass grafts.\r"

Forearm blood flow increased from a mean +/- SD value of 2.3 +/- 1.5 to 2.5 +/- 1.5 ml/min/100 ml forearm tissue (n = 25, p less than 0.05) in response to low dose (0.5 ng/min/100 ml forearm tissue) ET infusion and decreased to 1.78 +/- 1.3 and 1.1 +/- 0.9 ml/min/100 ml forearm tissue (p less than 0.001) during higher dosages (25 and 50 ng/min/100 ml forearm tissue). Sodium nitroprusside (0.6 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue, n = 6), acetylcholine (16 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue, n = 7), nifedipine (6 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue, n = 6), and verapamil (80 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue, n = 6) were infused alone and in combination with ET to evaluate the interactions between ET-induced vasoconstriction and stimulation of vascular muscle cyclic GMP levels by sodium nitroprusside, release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by acetylcholine, and blockade of voltage-operated calcium channels by nifedipine and verapamil. Neither the vasodilator nor the vasoconstrictor response to ET was influenced by sodium nitroprusside or acetylcholine. In contrast, both calcium antagonists converted ET-induced vasoconstriction (e.g., delta forearm vascular resistance to ET 50 ng/min/100 ml forearm tissue, 151 +/- 100% and 164 +/- 92% in verapamil and nifedipine groups, respectively) to vasodilation (-35 +/- 12% and -21 +/- 16%, p less than 0.05). Our results demonstrate both ET-induced vasodilation (at low dosages) and vasoconstriction (at high dosages) in resistance vessels of normal humans. Blockade of voltage-operated calcium channels prevented ET-induced vasoconstriction and unmasked the vasodilator effect of high ET dosages. In human resistance vessels, blockade of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels but not cyclic GMP-dependent vasodilation may be an effective tool to inhibit ET-induced vasoconstriction.\r"

Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was 23.1% in 1,524 women and 15.7% in 4,315 men (p less than 0.0005). One-year age-adjusted mortality rates in patients surviving hospitalization were 11.8% in women and 9.3% in men (p = 0.03). Cumulative age-adjusted 1-year mortality rates were 31.8% in women and 23.1% in men (p less than 0.0005). Relative odds of mortality, covariate-adjusted for major prognostic factors that included age, prior MI, congestive heart failure, and infarct location by electrocardiogram, indicated that female gender was independently and significantly associated with increased mortality both during hospitalization (relative odds, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-2.04) and at 1 year after discharge (relative odds, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.66). In separate multivariate analyses for each gender, a major factor that emerged as a predictor of outcome in women, but not in men, was a reported history of diabetes mellitus, both for in-hospital mortality and for 1-year mortality. However, even in the nondiabetics in this population, female gender was a significant, independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. The findings of the present study substantiate that women fare worse than men after suffering an acute MI, that increased age does not fully account for the increased mortality in women, and that diabetic women are at particularly high risk once MI has occurred.\r"

  ".W": "The Minnesota Heart Survey examined trends of Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a 50% random sample of all hospital discharges of patients with AMI or another acute coronary disease from 35 of 36 hospitals in 1970 and 30 of 31 hospitals in 1980 in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. A total of 1,901 and 1,864 potential AMI cases were abstracted in 1970 and 1980, respectively. Electrocardiograms were coded according to the Minnesota code. AMIs were validated by computerized algorithm based on chest pain, enzymes, electrocardiograms, and autopsy. This study shows that with the use of a consistent, standard diagnostic algorithm, attack rates for Q wave AMI did not change significantly between 1970 and 1980 and that attack rates for non-Q wave AMI decreased significantly during the same decade. However, when the more sensitive cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-MB were considered, attack rates of both Q wave and non-Q wave AMIs increased. This research documents four important trends for community AMI rates that are at variance with those reported by others. There was a decline in non-Q wave AMI attack rates from 1970 to 1980; women had outcomes equal to or worse than those for men for both case-fatality and 7-year survival rates; patients with non-Q wave AMIs had worse in-hospital prognoses than those with Q wave AMIs; and 7-year survival rates were worse for Q wave AMI in 1980. These findings demonstrate the need for standard diagnostic criteria for Q wave and non-Q wave AMI if trends are to be monitored. In the future, as new trials of operative and nonoperative therapies of AMI are undertaken, these considerations will increase in importance.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the morphological correlate of chronic heart failure. Myocardial tissue from eight patients undergoing transplantation surgery because of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy was investigated by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against elements of the cytoskeleton: desmin, tubulin, vinculin, and vimentin. The tissue showed hypertrophy, atrophy of myocytes, and an increased amount of fibrosis. Ultrastructural changes consisted of enlargement and varying shape of nuclei, numerous very small mitochondria, proliferation of T tubules, and accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen. The most obvious ultrastructural alteration was the decrease of myofilaments, ranging from rarefication to complete absence of sarcomeres in cells filled with unspecified cytoplasm. Immunocytochemistry showed that desmin was localized at the Z lines. In diseased myocardium, the amount of desmin was increased, but it was disorderly arranged. Tubulin formed a fine network throughout the myocytes and was significantly increased in cardiomyopathic hearts. Vinculin, a protein closely associated with the cytoskeleton, occurred not only at the sarcolemma and the intercalated disc but also within the myocardial cells. Ultrastructural changes and alterations of the cytoskeleton were severe in about one third of all cells. About one third of all cells showed moderately severe changes, and the remaining cells were normal. Vimentin was present in the interstitial cells and was increased in relation to the increase of fibrosis. We conclude that the increase of fibrosis, the degeneration of hypertrophied myocardial cells, and the alterations of the cytoskeleton are the morphological correlates of reduced myocardial function in chronic heart failure.\r"

To confirm these findings, we undertook an independent study with a prospective hypothesis regarding the frequencies of DR4 and DRw6; typing for a second family of class II antigens (HLA-DQ) was included because of the proximity of the DQ loci to the DR loci and the strong linkage disequilibrium between some of the DR and DQ alleles. Comparing a new consecutive series of IDC patients (n = 41) and healthy blood bank controls (n = 53), we confirmed an increase of DR4 antigen frequency in patients (49% versus 21%, p less than 0.005). A trend toward decreased expression of DRw6 among patients was also noted (10% of patients versus 23% of controls). HLA-DQw4 was significantly elevated in patients compared with controls (27% versus 6%, p less than 0.005; relative risk, 6.1; etiologic fraction, 0.22). We identified the combined DR4-DQw4 haplotype in five of 41 Caucasian IDC patients (12%) and none of 53 controls (p less than 0.007). A comparison of specific antigen frequencies between the preliminary and validation studies did not reveal significant differences; therefore, the data from the two studies were examined in combination. For the combined studies, DR4 was elevated (51% versus 27% in controls, p less than 0.001), and DRw6 was decreased (9% versus 24% in controls, p less than 0.01). The relative risk for DR4 was 2.8, and the etiologic fraction was 0.33.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children (age, 0.3-18 years) with cardiomyopathy. Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy, whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg). Blood pressures were measured in the aorta, pulmonary artery, right atrium, and pulmonary capillary wedge position; cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique. Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate, severe hypotensive response. In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac index increased by 22%, from 2.3 to 2.8 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and stroke volume increased by 22%, from 23 to 28 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 units.m2 (p less than 0.01), but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly. In contrast, four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril, but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension (mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg). Thus, captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy. In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy, however, captopril did not affect cardiac output, but it did decrease aortic pressure. These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease.\r"

Unfortunately, the predictive values of these methods are not known. We therefore compared the various methods in 261 patients undergoing surgery for SVT at Westmead Hospital since 1981. Surgical outcome was assessed by early tests during the first week after surgery (serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, telemetric monitoring of the electrocardiogram, and electrophysiological study performed using epicardial wires); later tests at 6 months after surgery (12-lead electrocardiograms and electrophysiological study); and symptomatic review done by telephone interview at a median of 34 months after surgery. Early tests were obtained in 97%, later tests were obtained in 76%, and symptomatic review was obtained in 98% of patients. All of the examined tests were inaccurate methods of surgical assessment compared with the late electrophysiological study. A large proportion of the patients proven to be surgical failures at the late electrophysiological study were not detected by early tests (83%), by later electrocardiograms (66%), or by symptomatic assessment (41%). Accurate assessment of surgical outcome requires a late electrophysiological study to permit comparison of surgical techniques. Late electrophysiological study also provides accurate information on the current risks and benefits of proposed surgery for communication to patients to enable them to make an informed decision on future treatment. Most patients are willing to have a late electrophysiological study and usually benefit from clarification of their true surgical outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals have shown that drug-induced action potential prolongation with class III antiarrhythmic agents increases with slow pacing rates. We studied the physiological rate dependence of sotalol effects on ventricular repolarization, measured as QT interval duration on the surface electrocardiogram at rest and during a maximal exercise test, in 10 normal volunteers. In a randomized, crossover study, three dosages of sotalol (160 mg/24 hr, 320 mg/24 hr, and 640 mg/24 hr) were administered during 4 days to each subject. In a control period, no drug was administered. During each period, 50-100 QT intervals were measured over a wide range of RR intervals recorded at rest and during the course of a maximal exercise test. Plasma sotalol concentration and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (percent reduction in peak exercise heart rate from control) were also measured. The QT-versus-RR relation was fitted to several formulas, and the overall best fit was used to calculate QT interval duration normalized for a heart rate of 60 beats/min (QTc) and to analyze the rate dependence of QT prolongation with sotalol. Sotalol-induced beta-adrenoceptor blockade and QTc prolongation were dose and concentration dependent. Sotalol reduced peak exercise heart rate by 13.8 +/- 7% at the dosage of 320 mg/24 hr and by 25.4 +/- 8% at the dosage of 640 mg/24 hr (both p less than 0.01). Sotalol prolonged QTc interval by 5.8 +/- 3.7% and 11.8 +/- 3% at these respective dosages (both p less than 0.01). The concentration of sotalol required to produce minimal (mean QTc prolongation, 5.6%; confidence interval, 0-11.2%) QTc prolongation (680 ng/ml) tended to be lower than that required for minimal (mean percent reduction in maximal exercise heart rate, 13.9%; confidence interval, 0-27.8%) beta-blockade (840 ng/ml). QT prolongation with sotalol increased with increasing RR intervals (i.e., decreasing heart rate) at all dosages. QT prolongation became statistically significant for RR of 800 msec or more at all dosages and for RR intervals of 600 msec or more at the dosage of 640 mg/24 hr. This rate dependence altered the relation between QT interval duration and sotalol plasma concentrations. These results suggest that sotalol prolongs QTc interval in humans at dosages and concentrations similar to those required to produce beta-adrenoceptor blockade, QT prolongation with sotalol is more pronounced when heart rate decreases and is not apparent during exercise-induced tachycardia, and the relation between QT prolongation with sotalol and plasma concentrations of the drug depends on the heart rate at which measurements are made.\r"

  ".W": "Although platelet cytosolic calcium has been shown to decrease during pharmacological treatment of hypertension, there is no evidence that cytosolic calcium also falls during a nonpharmacological reduction in blood pressure. To provide such evidence, we examined prospectively the relation between platelet cytosolic calcium and ambulatory blood pressure during weight reduction in moderately overweight (body mass index [BMI] greater than 25), mildly hypertensive individuals. The experimental group (responders: BMI reduction greater than 5%) consisted of 19 patients who lost 8.5 +/- 2.9 kg (mean +/- SD, p less than 0.05) during a 10-week hypocaloric diet, whereas the control group (nonresponders: BMI reduction less than 5%) consisted of 12 patients who showed no relevant change in body weight (-2.0 +/- 1.3 kg) during the same period of time. The moderate weight loss of the responders decreased blood pressure by 14/5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), as measured by ambulatory monitoring, which renders a placebo effect unlikely. This nonpharmacological reduction in blood pressure was accompanied by a proportional 11% decrease (p less than 0.05) in platelet cytosolic calcium and also by significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in plasma catecholamines and serum cholesterol. These findings establish the concept of a nonpharmacological reduction in free cytosolic platelet calcium in humans and add further evidence suggesting a link between intracellular calcium homeostasis and blood pressure regulation.\r"

As part of an ongoing community-based study of chronic disease, 641 Caucasian women between the ages of 50 and 89 years had blood pressure measured following the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program protocol. They also answered selected Health Interview Survey questions about their leisure-time activity and were classified into categories of light (58%), moderate (24%), heavy (6%), or no physical activity (12%) by the estimated metabolic rate required for each activity. Women who engaged in any physical activity were significantly younger and thinner than sedentary women and had lower fasting and 2-hour postchallenge insulin levels. They did not differ in alcohol consumption, cigarette use, or prevalence of coronary heart disease or diabetes. Rates of systolic and diastolic hypertension were significantly lower in women participating in light, moderate, or heavy physical activity compared with sedentary women. Blood pressure levels decreased with each increase in reported activity intensity (p less than 0.005 for trend), with systolic blood pressure approximately 20 mm Hg lower in the heaviest activity group compared with systolic blood pressure in sedentary women. Intergroup differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for age and body mass index. Although physical activity was associated with lower fasting and 2-hour postchallenge insulin levels (p less than 0.01 for trend), adjustment for insulin levels did not alter blood pressure differences among activity groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate factors contributing to reperfusion and reoxygenation myocardial injury, we exposed layers of cultured chick ventricular myocytes to severe hypoxia for up to 3 hours in the presence of 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose, zero glucose, and 5 mM pyruvate, and then exposed the myocytes to reoxygenation. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was moderately increased during 3 hours of hypoxia but was increased markedly during reoxygenation. Coincident changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and cell motion were also measured during hypoxia and reoxygenation. During hypoxia, [Ca2+]i increased to more than 1 microM, and with reoxygenation, [Ca2+]i abruptly decreased slightly but remained elevated more than 1 microM. Cells developed a stable rigor after 30 minutes of hypoxia. Reoxygenation caused a marked hypercontracture within 5 minutes. Pretreatment of myocytes with either 2,3-butanedione monoxime, which inhibits Ca2(+)-dependent force development, or cyanide inhibited reoxygenation hypercontracture. LDH release after reoxygenation was also significantly reduced in the presence of 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Treatment of myocytes with superoxide dismutase and catalase during hypoxia also resulted in a decrease in LDH release during reoxygenation. We conclude that an abrupt increase in [Ca2+]i during reoxygenation does not account for reoxygenation injury. However, in the presence of elevated [Ca2+]i, reoxygenation and the resulting probable resynthesis of ATP causes [Ca2+]i-dependent myofilament crossbridge cycling, and the resulting hypercontracture contributes to myocyte damage. The generation of oxygen free radicals after reoxygenation also appears to contribute to cell injury in this system.\r"

  ".U": "91121679\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P2) on the isolated Langendorff-perfused heart were studied by monitoring flavoprotein fluorescence, oxygen consumption (MVO2), coronary flow (Fc), systolic intraventricular pressure (Psys), diastolic intraventricular pressure, and contraction frequency. The cellular energy state and cytosolic pH were determined by means of 31P nuclear magnetic resonance. Infusion of 5 mM F-1,6-P2 caused a rapid shift toward reduction in the flavoprotein redox state and initial 50% and 44% decreases in Psys and MVO2, respectively. After a partial recovery, these measures remained 11% and 25% below the basal value. Concomitantly, after an initial transient increase of 13%, Fc remained 17% lower than in the basal state. When the F-1,6-P2 concentration was subsequently increased to 10 mM, psys and MVO2 dropped temporarily to 31% and 29% of the basal value and then remained at 50% and 53%, respectively. Simultaneously, a brief increase was observed in Fc, which then fell 34% below the basal value. Rapid reoxidation of the flavoproteins and increases in MVO2, Psys, and Fc occurred on discontinuation of the F-1,6-P2 infusion. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance during infusions of both 5 and 10 mM F-1,6-P2 revealed a decrease in cytosolic inorganic phosphate and a tendency to increase creatine phosphate, suggesting elevation in the cellular energy state. No changes in intracellular pH occurred as estimated from the chemical shift of the nuclear magnetic resonance of inorganic phosphate. F-1,6-P2 (5 mM and 10 mM) lowered the free Ca2+ concentration in the Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (by 32% and 47%, respectively). This probably explains the effects of F-1,6-P2 on mechanical work performance and cellular respiration. A direct metabolic effect also exists, however, because flavoprotein reduction by F-1,6-P2 could be observed in the K(+)-arrested heart, where its effects on MVO2 were minimal. This redox effect may not be caused by changes in free Ca2+ concentration because it could not be reproduced by infusion of EGTA.\r"

  ".U": "91121680\r", 
  ".W": "While color Doppler flow mapping has yielded a quick and relatively sensitive method for visualizing the turbulent jets generated in valvular insufficiency, quantification of the degree of valvular insufficiency has been limited by the dependence of visualization of turbulent jets on hemodynamic as well as instrument-related factors. Color Doppler flow imaging, however, does have the capability of reliably showing the spatial relations of laminar flows. An area where flow accelerates proximal to a regurgitant orifice is commonly visualized on the left ventricular side of a mitral regurgitant orifice, especially when imaging is performed with high gain and a low pulse repetition frequency. This area of flow convergence, where the flow stream narrows symmetrically, can be quantified because velocity and the flow cross-sectional area change in inverse proportion along streamlines centered at the orifice. In this study, a gravity-driven constant-flow system with five sharp-edged diaphragm orifices (ranging from 2.9 to 12 mm in diameter) was imaged both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of flow through the orifice. Color Doppler flow images were produced by zero shifting so that the abrupt change in display color occurred at different velocities. This \"aliasing boundary\" with a known velocity and a measurable radial distance from the center of the orifice was used to determine an isovelocity hemisphere such that flow rate through the orifice was calculated as 2 pi r2 x Vr, where r is the radial distance from the center of the orifice to the color change and Vr is the velocity at which the color change was noted. Using Vr values from 54 to 14 cm/sec obtained with a 3.75-MHz transducer and from 75 to 18 cm/sec obtained with a 2.5-MHz transducer, we calculated flow rates and found them to correlate with measured flow rates (r = 0.94-0.99). The slope of the regression line was closest to unity when the lowest Vr and the correspondingly largest r were used in the calculation. The flow rates estimated from color Doppler flow imaging could also be used in conjunction with continuous-wave Doppler measurements of the maximal velocity of flow through the orifice to calculate orifice areas (r = 0.75-0.96 correlation with measured areas).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study the effect of pressure and volume within the receiving chamber on the magnitude of spatial distribution of regurgitant jets assessed by color Doppler techniques, we designed a simple constant-flow model in which a jet was driven through a known orifice (1.5 mm2) into a compliant receiving chamber by a steady-flow pump. A distal tube at the outflow closed the system and maintained the volume of the chamber constant during pump operation. We varied flow rate from 60 to 270 ml/min into elastic balloons with different static compliances of 1, 2, 4.5, and 9 ml/mm Hg (pressures of 57, 28, 18, and 8 mm Hg, respectively); the balloons served as receiving chambers at the constant volume of 150 ml. We also evaluated the effect of different volumes of a receiving chamber (110, 130, and 150 ml and pressures of 5, 15, and 24 mm Hg) with a static compliance of 2 ml/mm Hg over the same range of flow rates. For each of the different balloons, jet area correlated linearly with the jet velocity across the orifice (r = 0.98, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.97) and also with flow rate (r = 0.97, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99). At the same flow rate and volume of receiving chamber, however, the jet area imaged by color Doppler decreased as the pressure in the receiving chamber increased, although receiving-chamber volume was constant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We examined the effect of clofilium, a drug that prolongs cardiac action potential duration without slowing cardiac conduction, on defibrillation energy requirements and ventricular effective refractory periods in a canine model during a 3-week period. Epicardial patch electrodes were implanted in 12 dogs, and baseline testing was conducted under fentanyl anesthesia on day 7. An oral clofilium (100 mg/day) regimen was started on day 8. Six clofilium-treated and six control dogs underwent repeated testing on days 14, 21, and 28 after surgery. Truncated trapezoidal shocks were given repeatedly at various stored energies in random order; delivered current and impedance were measured; and delivered energy was calculated. The energy and current for 50% success in defibrillation (E50 and I50, respectively) were determined. For control animals, E50 increased by a mean 34 +/- 78%, 60 +/- 83%, and 69 +/- 122% compared with baseline (day 7) on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively.

  ".W": "Prior studies have demonstrated the presence of inhomogeneities in myocardial [K+]e after serial 10-minute occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery in the pig, even within restricted locations of an ischemic zone. These inhomogeneities are thought to underlie the electrophysiological abnormalities responsible for lethal ventricular arrhythmias through reentrant and nonreentrant pathways, but a clear association has not been demonstrated. As a prerequisite to establishing this association, these studies were performed to establish measurement standards for [K+]e inhomogeneity, to quantify the magnitude and time course of these inhomogeneities, to determine whether the inhomogeneities are greater in the ischemic border where lethal ventricular arrhythmias are known to originate, and to assess the effect of a known antifibrillatory drug on [K+]e inhomogeneities. [K+]e (expressed as the change in potassium equilibrium potential, dEK [mV]) was measured in 15 preparations using an average of 17 closely spaced, critically calibrated K(+)-sensitive electrodes having stable response characteristics. A series of four 10-minute occlusions each separated by a 50-minute reperfusion period were performed in each study. In half of the studies, intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.0065 mg/kg/hr) was administered before the fourth occlusion. In nine studies (five control and four verapamil), electrodes were placed in the marginal ischemic zone (from 2 mm outside to 5 mm inside the visible cyanotic border). In six other studies (three control and three verapamil), electrodes were placed in the central ischemic zone (10-20 mm within the ischemic region). We determined that the standard deviation is the best measure of inhomogeneity and that 12 equivalent measurement sites are required to estimate it with a satisfactory degree of statistical confidence. We found that after 10 minutes of ischemia, mean dEK was 1.6 times greater in the central than in the marginal ischemic zone, whereas mean standard deviation at the same time was 1.5 times greater in the marginal than in the central ischemic zone. Verapamil reduced mean dEK and mean standard deviation in both ischemic zones for most of the occlusion by delaying the rise in [K+]e and the inhomogeneity of that rise by 3-5 minutes. Comparisons of mean dEK with mean standard deviation revealed a steep linear relation in the marginal zone and a curvilinear relation in the central zone where higher mean dEK values were not accompanied by higher values for mean standard deviation. Furthermore, we determined that these relations were not altered by verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Chronic supraventricular tachycardia causes a dilated cardiomyopathy in man. Terminating this tachycardia appears to result in symptomatic improvement; however, its effects on left ventricular (LV) volume, mass, and function have not been fully examined. Accordingly, hemodynamic studies using simultaneous echocardiography and catheterization were performed in three groups of pigs: 1) those subjected to rapid left atrial pacing (240 beats/min) for 3 weeks (SVT, n = 8), 2) those subjected to supraventricular tachycardia for 3 weeks followed by termination of pacing and a 4-week recovery period (PSVT, n = 9), and 3) sham-operated controls (CTR, n = 10). Systolic pump function was assessed using fractional shortening (FS), peak ejection rate [peak (-)dD/dt], and maximum rate of pressure development [peak (+)dP/dt]. Diastolic function was assessed using the time constant of isovolumic pressure decline (tau), peak early diastolic filling rate [peak (+)dD/dt], the chamber stiffness constant (Kc), and the myocardial stiffness constant (Km). Supraventricular tachycardia caused LV dilation (end-diastolic dimension [EDD] increased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 cm in CTR to 4.9 +/- 0.5 cm in SVT, p less than 0.05) but no change in LV mass (LV weight-to-body weight ratio [LV/BW]) was 2.58 +/- 0.3 g/kg in CTR and 2.66 +/- 0.4 g/kg in SVT), all indexes of systolic function became abnormal (FS fell from 30 +/- 4% in CTR to 13 +/- 5% in SVT, p less than 0.05), and the indexes of relaxation and filling were slowed (tau increased from 36 +/- 3 msec in CTR to 51 +/- 13 msec in SVT, p less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in Kc or Km. After terminating the supraventricular tachycardia, LV volume fell but remained greater than that in CTR (EDD was 4.2 +/- 0.4 cm in PSVT, p less than 0.05 versus CTR) and substantial LV hypertrophy developed (LV/BW was 3.48 +/- 0.5 g/kg in PSVT, p less than 0.05 versus CTR). Systolic function returned to normal (FS was 31 +/- 5% in PSVT) but diastolic function remained abnormal. In PSVT, tau remained prolonged (49 +/- 12 msec, p less than 0.05 versus CTR), Kc increased from 3.7 +/- 1.0 in CTR to 7.4 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.05), and Km increased from 4.4 +/- 1.5 in CTR to 13.9 +/- 9.7 (p less than 0.05). Thus, the improvement in systolic function that occurs after the termination of supraventricular tachycardia is associated with the development of LV hypertrophy and persistent diastolic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "We recently hypothesized that after pharmacologically induced coronary thrombolysis, increased activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) retards recanalization, contributes to early reocclusion, or both. This hypothesis was based on the increased elaboration of PAI-1 that we observed in cultured liver cells exposed to growth factors releasable from platelets activated at sites of thrombosis in vivo. PAI-1 released locally is particularly likely to attenuate lysis of thrombi that are targets of thrombolytic drugs. Accordingly, the present study was performed to determine whether synthesis of PAI-1 by endothelial cells is augmented by products of platelets. Lysates from platelets (0.5-8.0 x 10(4)/mm3 media, i.e. less than 10% of the concentration of platelets in blood) increased synthesis and release of PAI-1 into both the extracellular matrix and conditioned media (by 2.8-fold and 3.3-fold within 6 and 24 hours, respectively). Synthesis of neither tissue-type plasminogen activator nor overall protein increased. Increased synthesis of PAI-1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of [35S]PAI-1 after metabolic labeling of cells. The increased elaboration of PAI-1 was consistent with increased transcription as reflected by the observed increase in PAI-1 mRNA of 2.2-fold in 4 hours. Effects of platelet lysates were simulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), known to be present in platelet alpha-granules and released with platelet activation. Antibody to TGF-beta reduced the stimulation of PAI-1 synthesis by TGF-beta, as expected, by 82%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, the effects of the toxin were examined on endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations of hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic porcine coronary arteries to assess the functional state of the endothelial pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Male Yorkshire pigs were maintained on either a regular diet (control group, n = 7) or a 2% high-cholesterol diet (cholesterol-fed group, n = 7) for 10 weeks. After the initial 2 weeks of maintenance, animals in both groups underwent balloon catheter removal of the endothelium of the left anterior descending or left circumflex coronary arteries. Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro after 10 weeks of maintenance; at this time, a full lining of endothelial cells in both left coronary arteries was confirmed histologically. In arteries with endothelium of the control group (normal responses), pertussis toxin significantly inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxations to serotonin, UK14304 (a selective alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist), and thrombin but not those to ADP, bradykinin, or the calcium ionophore A23187. In previously denuded arteries of the control group (effects of endothelial regeneration alone) or intact arteries of the cholesterol-fed group (effects of hypercholesterolemia alone), the relaxations to serotonin, UK14304, and thrombin were impaired significantly; those relaxations were impaired further in previously denuded arteries of the cholesterol-fed group (effects of atherosclerosis). The inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin were significantly reduced after endothelial regeneration and in hypercholesterolemia and were almost absent in atherosclerosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effect of altered loading conditions on left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure-volume relations during acute coronary artery occlusion that was produced by inflation of an intracoronary balloon. Open-chest anesthetized dogs (n = 18) were instrumented so that LV pressure (micromanometer) and LV volume (conductance) could be measured without disturbing the pericardium. The effects of brief periods of occlusion (1-2 minutes) were assessed under steady-state conditions before and after dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent and during vena caval occlusion. Under steady-state conditions before dextran infusion with the pericardium removed, at an LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) of 8.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, occlusion resulted in a rightward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP, 2.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg; delta LVEDV, 6.3 +/- 4.7 ml, both p less than 0.05 versus control). After dextran infusion (LVEDP, 20.9 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), occlusion resulted in a rightward and upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop (delta LVEDP, 5.8 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; delta LVEDV, 4.2 +/- 3.0 ml, both p less than 0.05 versus control). At low cardiac volumes before dextran infusion, the intact pericardium did not affect the response to occlusion. By contrast, after dextran infusion in the presence of an intact pericardium, LVEDP significantly increased (delta, 6.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) but LVDEV did not (delta, 0.7 +/- 1.5 ml, p = NS). There was a parallel upward shift in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop that was eliminated by removal of the pericardium. Thus, the change in LV diastolic pressure and volume during occlusion varied and depended on the baseline cardiac volume and presence of the pericardium. Before dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent, coronary artery occlusion did not alter the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter, which was calculated from the diastolic interval of an averaged steady-state beat (0.040 +/- 0.019 versus 0.036 +/- 0.015 mm Hg/ml, p = NS). After dextran infusion with the pericardium present and absent, coronary artery occlusion increased the LV diastolic chamber stiffness parameter (0.057 +/- 0.034 and 0.074 +/- 0.034 mm Hg/ml, both p less than 0.05 versus controls, respectively). Vena caval occlusion eliminated the shifts in the diastolic portion of the LV pressure-volume loop with the pericardium present and absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Canine hearts were studied in an isolated blood-perfused heart apparatus (isovolumic LV); contractile dysfunction was produced by 60 or 90 minutes of global ischemia, followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion. Nine normal hearts underwent 60 minutes of ischemia, and five underwent 90 minutes of ischemia. After the ischemia-reperfusion sequence, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 14 hearts. In the group undergoing 60 minutes of ischemia, LV diastolic pressure did not increase, whereas Emax decreased from 5.2 +/- 2.5 to 2.9 +/- 1.4 mm Hg/ml (p less than 0.05). In the group undergoing 90 minutes of ischemia, diastolic pressure increased (from 10 +/- 2 to 37 +/- 20 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and Emax did not change significantly (from 5.1 +/- 4.3 to 4.3 +/- 2.5 mm Hg/ml). A second series of experiments was performed in 13 hearts with pressure-overload hypertrophy (aortic-band model with echocardiography and catheterization studies before the ischemia-reperfusion protocol). Five had evidence for pump failure, whereas eight remained compensated. After 60 minutes of ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion, developed pressure, pressure-volume area, and myocardial ATP level were significantly less than those at baseline in all 13 hearts.

  ".W": "Acute ischemia of the lower limb remains a significant risk to both life and limb. Mortality rates of approximately 10-30% and amputation rates of the same magnitude in the survivors are repeatedly reported despite advances in medical and surgical techniques. Our experience, which utilized percutaneous intra-arterial thrombolysis as the initial treatment in 72 instances (63 patients), has resulted in a markedly lower mortality rate of 1.6% and a lower amputation rate of 8.5% in the survivors. Careful categorization by clinical degree of ischemia indicates that 82% of the cases were either threatened or irreversible limb ischemia. The initial treatment with thrombolysis did not preclude subsequent prompt surgical treatment when necessary; in these cases, thrombolysis promoted improved surgical results (100%) when it was successful. It markedly reduced the need for urgent surgery, usually simplified the subsequent surgical approach, diminished the overall need for surgery, and often accomplished a successful outcome alone (31%). Significant bleeding was not noted during subsequent surgical procedures and was noted in only 2.8% of the cases. Confirmation of these results and further improvements in technique might justify the use of an initially high-dose urokinase transcatheter infusion regimen as the initial treatment of choice for acute lower-limb ischemia.\r"

Therefore, the indications for its use have not been firmly established and must take into consideration the natural history of the occlusive disease itself. Although some type of procedural intervention clearly is warranted in the presence of ischemic rest pain or tissue necrosis, intermittent claudication is the only complaint in approximately 70% of patients who present with either aortoiliac or femoropopliteal involvement. Most nondiabetic patients experience substantial symptomatic improvement with a daily exercise program, and their long-term risks for either abrupt deterioration (20-25%) or amputation (less than 10%) are relatively low. In comparison, the 5-year mortality rate ranges from 20-40% even in claudicants, and as many as 40% of those with clinical indications of associated coronary artery disease have been shown angiographically to be candidates for myocardial revascularization. These observations suggest that traditional indications for surgical treatment (truly disabling claudication and/or limb salvage) also should be applied to endovascular therapy until its success is confirmed beyond speculation, and that incidental coronary disease deserves particular attention in patients with lower extremity ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The two major types of intravascular stents are balloon expandable and self-expanding. Many animal and, more recently, clinical studies have begun to delineate the real and potential roles of stents. Although the ideal intravascular stent does not exist, it is possible to identify characteristics of the hypothetical ideal stent. Iliac and femoropopliteal arterial applications of metallic stents are reviewed. Stents have proved useful in postangioplasty elastic recoil, in some cases of postangioplasty restenosis, and in angioplasty-induced dissection. Their role in primary angioplasty procedures is still uncertain, although in iliac angioplasty the immediate hemodynamic effects of angioplasty plus stenting are superior to those of angioplasty alone. It is clear that metallic stents have not solved the problem of postangioplasty restenosis, as restenosis still occurs in a significant number of cases. This problem is particularly evident in the femoropopliteal stent procedures, in which angiographic restenosis (more than 50% single diameter stenosis) at 6 months after treatment has occurred in approximately 30% of cases. The existence of poststenting restenosis, which often involves the stented segment, underscores the need for better drug regimens in angioplasty and for better understanding of the intimal fibrocellular proliferative response of the vessel wall to injury. Although potentially very useful, biodegradable stents are still a dream whose realization will demand the development of better materials.\r"

Diagnosis of the former is both simpler and more rewarding, whereas atheromatous lesions of the renal artery may be secondary to essential hypertension. It is therefore important to establish existence of functional renal ischemia as well as an anatomical lesion. Universal screening of all hypertensive patients is not recommended because of the relatively low prevalence of the disease and insufficient accuracy of available screening tests. When renovascular hypertension is clinically suspected, an oral captopril test is the most reliable office screening test. After this, digital subtraction angiography with renal vein renins or captopril renography are appropriate steps. However, the latter procedure, while promising, requires further evaluation. Duplex scanning of the renal arteries also comes into this category. Arteriography is done last, so that if renal ischemia is indicated, angioplasty can be attempted at the same time as arteriography.\r"

Twenty-six patients (39%) were cured, 39 (59%) were classified as improved, and one (2%) did not respond to PTA. Fourteen of the patients also had elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.

Surgical revascularization is currently the treatment of choice for patients with branch renal artery disease, ostial atherosclerotic renal artery disease, a renal artery aneurysm, and patients in whom renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been unsuccessful. Excellent clinical results continue to be achieved with surgical revascularization in properly selected patients.\r"

Both xenon computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography can be performed on current systems with minimal hardware and software modifications. As a result, standard anatomic and structural imaging can be supplemented with diverse information such as quantitative brain perfusion without and with flow challenging as well as flow mapping and velocity imaging, which approximates conventional x-ray angiography.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of complex cerebrovascular disorders, including intracranial aneurysms, carotid cavernous sinus fistulas, vertebral fistulas, arteriovenous malformations, atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic vessels, and arterial vasospasm, is being performed in selected cases by interventional neurovascular techniques. Recent advances in microballoon technology, permanent solidifying polymers, newer embolic agents, high-resolution digital subtraction angiography with road-mapping technique, and steerable micro-guide wires and catheters have greatly improved access in the distal intracranial circulation and markedly reduced the morbidity associated with these procedures. Interventional neuroradiology is emerging as an important adjunct to neurosurgery for selected cerebrovascular disorders.\r"

Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 (70%) of patients, including six patients with sudden coronary death. Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had cardiac causes of death and six (30%) had noncardiac causes of death. Two major subgroups of histological findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%) and 2) atherosclerotic plaques only. Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaques only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions. No morphological evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, or tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaques only. Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup. On the basis of these morphological findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for coronary artery balloon angioplasty restenosis are proposed.\r"

The indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty included claudication in 117 patients (58.5%), rest pain or ischemic night pain in 47 (23.5%), limb salvage in 33 (16.5%), and aiding in wound healing in three (1.5%). In the series, 70% of the patients had two or more cardiovascular risk factors. Angioplasty was initially unsuccessful in 14 patients, and 10 patients were lost to follow-up. Follow-up was obtained in 176 patients. The long-term results were analyzed using the life table method to determine cumulative patency. Fourteen patients were considered failures because of recurrent disease or symptoms. The projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 85%. When the response to redilatation was considered, the projected 7.5-year cumulative patency rate was 92%. The results indicate that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can successfully correct aortoiliac lesions and provide a long-term benefit for as long as 7.5 years.\r"

In this article, the major problematic reporting practices are discussed and illustrated, and 14 recommendations are advanced to deal with them. They are intended to provide precise definitions, objective criteria of success or failure, standardized severity gradation schemes for peripheral vascular disease and its risk factors, and proper procedures for reporting the outcome of all forms of therapeutic intervention. Until these or some other agreed upon reporting standards are accepted and followed, the literature on peripheral vascular disease and its management will continue to be a source of confusion rather than enlightenment.\r"

Operative mortality occurred after four of these operations (1.4%), including three deaths from myocardial infarction and one death from stroke. The femoropopliteal bypass patients were divided into groups for patency analysis, including those undergoing bypass surgery with a good quality greater saphenous vein versus alternate bypass conduits and patients undergoing primary limb bypass versus those undergoing repeat bypass after prior bypass failure. Our overall primary graft patency for all femoropopliteal grafts was 79% at 5 years. Patients undergoing bypass with a good quality greater saphenous vein had primary graft patency of 85% at 5 years. Patients undergoing bypass using a conduit other than greater saphenous vein had a 5-year patency of 73%. Patients undergoing repeat bypass after a prior failed bypass had a 5-year patency of 57%.\r"

Excluding an initial technical failure rate of 10%, overall patencies at 1, 3, and 5 years were 81%, 61%, and 58%, respectively. After the first year, the prognosis (i.e., failure rate) appears to be linear over the long term (i.e., up to 10 years). Factors negatively influencing long-term patency include the presence of diabetes mellitus, diffuse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or threatened limb loss. Technical factors correlated with failure include lesion length, moderate eccentricity, and a poor post-PTA appearance.\r"

There was an 88% (38/43) technical success rate (complete clot lysis) and a 74% (32/43) clinical success rate. Complications occurred in 10 patients (23%) and were related to bleeding in four patients (9%). Patient age, graft age, location, material, and the duration of occlusion did not significantly influence the initial outcome, although there was a trend toward a higher bleeding complication rate among grafts less than or equal to 1 month of age at the time of thrombolysis. A second group of 43 infrainguinal grafts successfully recanalized using regional infusions of thrombolytic agents were followed for long-term patency. This group included 32 grafts successfully treated with urokinase and 11 grafts recanalized with streptokinase. By life-table analysis there was a 55.6% 1-year patency, which fell to 42.4% at 4 years. Vein grafts had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than prosthetic grafts (69.3% versus 28.6% at 30 months). Grafts with flow-limiting lesions identified and corrected by angioplasty or surgery also had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than those without such lesions (79.0% versus 9.8% at 2 years). Based on the results of our study compared with a survey of long-term results following secondary surgical procedures for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts, thrombolysis can be recommended in several circumstances. Thrombolysis is indicated for thrombosed vein grafts or when thrombus is present in distal runoff vessels. Thrombosed prosthetic grafts should be replaced by autogenous vein grafts whenever possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At each infusion rate, the rate of glucose infusion needed to maintain euglycaemia was less in the patients than in the control subjects.

A similar pattern was seen for forearm glucose uptake, with a marked impairment of both sensitivity to insulin and maximal responsiveness. 3.

Cardiovascular responses to three different interventions, namely the Valsalva manoeuvre, deep breathing and a cold stimulus on the face, were studied in two ethnic groups (European and Bangladeshi) that have been shown to differ in the prevalence of hypertensive-vascular disease. The data obtained consisted of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, heart rate measured by using a beat-by-beat non-invasive blood pressure monitor (the Finapres), forearm blood flow determined by venous occlusion plethysmography, and calculated forearm vascular resistance. 2. The resting haemodynamic status was similar in European and Bangladeshi subjects. However, Bangladeshi subjects showed a greater increase in heart rate, but only after 20 s into the Valsalva manoeuvre, and greater overshoots in mean blood pressure after the manoeuvre than the European subjects. Furthermore, after cold face stimulation the fall in forearm vascular resistance to baseline levels was delayed in Bangladeshi subjects relative to that in the European subjects. 3. There were no inter-group differences in the reflex bradycardia relative to mean blood pressure or in the cardiac baroreflex sensitivity estimated from systolic blood pressure and pulse interval after the Valsalva manoeuvre. In addition, values for the mean difference between maximum and minimum pulse intervals during deep breathing did not differ in Bangladeshi and European subjects. 4. These findings together suggest that, although cardiac vagal reflex responses appear similar in the two groups, sympatho-adrenal influences on the heart and vasculature may be greater in Bangladeshi subjects than in European subjects.\r"

As insulin activates the sympathetic nervous system, the present study was undertaken to measure the plasma noradrenaline concentration in the fasting state and after 75 g of oral glucose in simple-obese patients (n = 13), in non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetic patients (n = 37) and in normal control subjects (n = 12). 2. The fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration was similarly reduced in the simple-obese group and in the diabetic obese group compared with the control group (P = 0.005). The glucose-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration was normal in the simple-obese group, but was abolished in the obese diabetic patients (P = 0.008). 3. Step-wise regression analysis indicated that independent effects on the fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration were exerted by age (r = +0.32, P = 0.002), glucose concentration (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and the degree of obesity (r = -0.37, P = 0.007), but not by plasma insulin concentration. 4. These results show that obese patients have a reduced fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration independently of accompanying diabetes, but that the response of noradrenaline to oral glucose is only abolished in the obese diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "1. Reserpine (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally) produced gastric mucosal vasoconstriction and injury in all rats within 6 h (injury score 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM). Coeliac ganglionectomy or the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drug propranolol (5-15 mg/kg) did not influence these effects of reserpine, but vagotomy protected the rats against them. The alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine at 5 mg/kg were protective against injury. However, a 10 mg/kg dose of either blocker was more effective (2.2 +/- 0.5 mm2 and 3 +/- 0.8 mm2, respectively, versus 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) and a dose of 15 mg/kg afforded complete protection. 2. Methysergide, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, produced a dose-dependent increase in the reserpine-induced injury; a significant (P less than 0.05) increase was noted with 15 and 20 mg/kg (47.5 +/- 2.9 mm2 and 49.4 +/- 2.2 mm2, respectively, versus 38.8 +/- 2.1 mm2, mean +/- SEM). 3. The results suggest that, in the rat, reserpine causes vagal alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation producing gastric mucosal vasoconstriction and injury. 5-Hydroxytryptamine is not implicated in the mechanism of this injury and affords protection against it.\r"

This study was designed to examine whether normal subjects could differentiate between the 'intensity' of their breathlessness and the amount of 'distress' it evoked, by specific wording of the instructions. 2. A preliminary study showed no significant difference between 'distress' score during exercise measured on two separate occasions (P = 0.3). 3. Ten subjects each performed two identical incremental cycle-ergometer exercise tests on separate occasions during which they were asked to quantify either 'intensity' or 'distress' by using modified Borg scales. 4. In all subjects there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.001) between 'intensity' and minute ventilation. In eight subjects there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.05) between 'distress' and minute ventilation. One subject displayed no significant correlation and one registered no distress. 5. Mean 'intensity' was greater than the mean 'distress' (P = 0.0001). The slope of 'intensity'/minute ventilation was greater than the slope of 'distress'/minute ventilation (P = 0.0001). 6. Within individuals there was a significant correlation between 'intensity' and 'distress' (P less than 0.05). There was a wide scatter in the slope of this relationship between subjects and maximum 'intensity' and 'distress' did not correlate. 7. Different elements of the breathlessness sensation could be identified and selectively measured depending on the wording of the instructions given to the subject. 8. There was a wide intersubject variation in the magnitude of both breathlessness 'intensity' and 'distress' estimates, but the differences between subjects in these two components of the sensation did not appear to follow a common pattern.\r"

  ".W": "1. The renal handling of glucose was determined in male X-linked hypophosphataemic (Hyp/Y) mice and in control littermates (+/Y) aged 4 months. Plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion were measured before and during stepwise increase in glycaemia induced by an acute infusion of glucose. The relationship between plasma glucose concentration and urinary glucose excretion was monitored per ml of glomerular filtrate in mice fed high and low phosphate diets. 2. Hyp/Y mice fed the high phosphate diet showed a significantly higher glucosuria compared with +/Y littermates. When glycaemia was increased, Hyp/Y mice developed frank glucosuria earlier than +/Y animals. In Hyp/Y mice we could not find a threshold below which virtually no glucose was excreted in the urine, whereas this was clearly visible in +/Y mice. These differences persisted in animals fed the low phosphate diet. 3. Using the acute response to the glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon and insulin, administered exogenously, we found that the regulation of plasma glucose concentration did not differ between Hyp/Y and +/Y mice. 4. The significantly lower plasma glucose concentration observed in Hyp/Y as compared with +/Y mice decreased further during fasting. 5. We conclude that the renal reabsorptive capacity for glucose is defective in Hyp/Y mice and their low plasma glucose concentration may be explained by the renal leak. Therefore the X-linked phosphataemic mouse appears not only to be characterized by a defect in renal phosphate and calcium reabsorption but also by an altered glucose reabsorption.\r"

  ".W": "1. At present there is no consensus about the optimal management of hyponatraemia to prevent demyelinating brain lesions. We have evaluated in a large series of rats (n = 136) the protective role of urea for the brain in the treatment of severe chronic hyponatraemia. Urea (group I, n = 51) was compared with hypertonic saline in boluses (group II, n = 46) and with hypertonic saline in divided doses (group III, n = 39). Treatment was administered intraperitoneally over 48 h. The severity of brain lesions was assessed by histological scoring. 2. For 95% of the injured animals treated with hypertonic saline, brain lesions appeared for an absolute increment in serum Na+ concentration (delta SNa+) of 20 mmol day-1 l-1. Above this limit neurological injuries gradually worsened, and beyond a transition zone (delta SNa+ greater than or equal to 20 less than or equal to 23 mmol day-1 l-1) 89% (group III) to 100% (group II) of the animals were injured. This limit can be reached rapidly, as attested by the comparable severity of brain lesions observed in group II (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after a bolus injection, 19 mmol/l) and in group III (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after an injection, 2 mmol/l), both groups achieving similar daily delta SNa+. 3. A correction above the threshold of 20 mmol day-1 l-1 is as toxic during the first 24 h as during the second day of the treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood transfusions improve renal allograft survival rates, but may induce antibodies which are directed to class I major histocompatibility complex antigens and mediate hyperacute transplant rejection. A model to study the development of such antibodies was developed in inbred strains of rats. 2. The influence of transplantation antigens shared between an initial course of blood transfusions, given with cyclosporin A, and a subsequent antigenic challenge (blood transfusion), given without cyclosporin A, on alloantibody responses to class I major histocompatibility complex antigens was then investigated. 3. Cyclosporin A administration prevented the development of alloantibodies to class I major histocompatibility complex antigens during the initial transfusion period. 4. After the challenge transfusions, alloantibody responses to class I major histocompatibility complex antigens were suppressed when class I major histocompatibility complex or minor histocompatibility antigens were shared between the initial and final transfusions. 5. This suppression only extended to third party class I antigens when minor histocompatibility complex antigens were shared between the initial and final transfusions. Sharing of class I or class II antigens had no effect on alloantibody responses to third party class I antigens coexpressed on the same cell. 6. These studies suggest that cyclosporin A given with blood transfusions may prevent clinical sensitization while permitting the development of suppressor activity, mediated by shared minor histocompatibility complex determinants, to a broad range of potential donor antigens.\r"

In 12 healthy volunteers and 12 patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (46 +/- 5 months after the operation; mean +/- SEM), perfused anal manometry was performed; movements of the anorectal angle were quantitated scintigraphically; and rectal capacity and compliance were measured by air insufflation of an intrarectal balloon at three infusion rates. The efficiency of rectal evacuation of three consistencies (5 percent, liquid; 7.5 percent semisolid gel; 11.25 percent solid gel; w/w) of Tc99m labeled artificial stool (aluminum magnesium silicate gel) was quantitated by gamma camera imaging. No abnormalities of pelvic floor function were demonstrated in either controls or patients. The mean neorectal capacity and compliance of patients with IPAA did not differ from control, (capacity; IPAA: 215 +/- 22 ml vs. control; 245 +/- 29 ml; compliance; IPAA: 5.5 +/- 0.7 ml/cm H2O vs. control; 6.6 +/- 0.7 ml/cm H2O; P greater than 0.05). In controls, the percentage of the 7.5 percent consistency evacuated (81 +/- 5 percent, mean +/- SEM) was significantly more than the percentage evacuation of either the 5 percent consistency (67 +/- 7 percent) or the 11.25 percent consistency (77 +/- 2 percent) (P less than 0.05). After IPAA, the mean overall percent evacuation of the three stool consistencies was significantly less than control (52 +/- 6 percent after IPAA; 75 +/- 5 percent control, P less than 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in neorectal emptying between the liquid, the semisolid gel and the solid gel (56 +/- 6, 55 +/- 6, 51 +/- 9 percent, respectively, P greater than 0.1). We concluded that in healthy subjects but not in patients after IPAA, stool consistency affected the efficiency of evacuation of enteric content.\r"

Seventeen of the patients had a double loop (J) ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) and 18 a triple loop (S) pouch. The patients were examined a mean of 27.9 months and 5.1 months, respectively, after ileostomy closure. Ten of the S-pouch patients were evaluated more than 6 months (S greater than 6 months), mean 9.1 after ileostomy closure. There were no differences in the mean maximum resting pressures or maximum squeeze pressures between the groups. The incidence of daytime and nocturnal leakage was lower in the S-pouch group, 22 and 29 percent, than in the J group 29, and 53 percent. Though the mean maximum tolerated volume (MTV) of the S-pouch group was greater than the J group, the difference was not statistically significant. The difference in the mean compliance between the J- and S-pouch groups and the J and S greater than 6 months group was statistically significant (P less than 0.01) and (P less than 0.008). All the patients could evacuate spontaneously. The difference in the 24-hour frequency of defecation between the S greater than 6 months and J group was significant (P less than 0.05), but not between the S and J groups. The median frequency of nocturnal defecation between the S greater than 6 months and J pouch groups was significant (P less than 0.005), but not between the S and J groups. The triple loop S-pouches were more compliant than the J-pouches and had a better functional result as shown by a lower incidence of nocturnal leakage, and a lower frequency of defecation during the day and night.\r"

All patients were prospectively evaluated with preoperative anorectal manometry, electromyography, and pudendal nerve motor latency assessment, postoperative anorectal manometry, and preoperative and postoperative functional evaluation. Mean and maximal resting pressures increased from 30 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg preoperatively to 40 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively. Likewise, mean and maximal squeeze pressures increased from 27 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg preoperatively to 39 mm Hg and 73 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, anal canal high pressure zone length was increased by sphincteroplasty from a mean of 0.9 cm (range 0-3 cm) to a mean of 2.1 cm (range 1-4 cm). These objective physiologic improvements correlated well with subjective functional improvement. Subjectively, functional outcome was rated by patients as excellent in 38 percent, good in 38 percent, fair in 19 percent, and poor in only 5 percent of cases. Overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication improves both the anal sphincter physiologic profile and fecal continence.\r"

In this study, patients with obstructed defecation underwent manometry and proctography before and after rectopexy. Seventeen patients (16 females and one male, mean age 51.6 years) were studied. Eleven underwent anterior and posterior fixation of the rectum and six had posterior fixation only. Preoperatively five patients demonstrated rectoanal intussusceptions. Fifteen had significant pelvic descent. No significant change in maximum resting pressure, maximum voluntary contraction, pelvic descent, or anorectal angle was seen postoperatively. In the initial follow-up, many patients had significant amelioration of symptoms. However, on longer follow-up (mean 30.8 months) only two had long-term improvement. The remainder had a poor clinical result in spite of complete resolution of rectal intussusception. Many reported a worsening of symptoms as reflected by an increase in tenesmus and stool frequency. In the two cases with a satisfactory result, both could empty the rectum completely and demonstrated rectoanal intussusception on preoperative evacuation proctography. In those with poor results, four had complete emptying and three had rectoanal intussusception. In conclusion rectopexy is an ineffective treatment for obstructive defecation in most patients.\r"

Conversely, none of the 55 non-FAP adenomas or of the 20 specimens with ulcerative colitis (10 with dysplasia) had similar amounts of intraepithelial granules. Feulgen studies demonstrated that the granules contain DNA and are probably nuclear fragments of destroyed lymphocytes. Although the pathogenesis of this phenomenon remains obscure, it appears that the presence of large to moderate number of intraepithelial bodies in colorectal adenomas should strongly raise the suspicion of FAP.\r"

The anorectal angle (ARA) is one parameter which is usually quantified during this examination. To determine the accuracy with which this measurement can be made, three physicians independently measured the resting and squeezing ARAs of 22 women. The coefficient of variation and the kappa statistic were used to describe the degree of agreement among the three examiners. These analyses revealed poor agreement among examiners for all 22 patients taken as individuals, (kappa less than or equal to 0.40; mean coefficient of variation at rest = 18 percent; mean coefficient during squeezing = 21 percent). These results suggest that measurements of ARAs will vary among examiners for any particular patient, even though individual examiners may demonstrate consistency in recording ARA data. There is wide interobserver variation in the measurement of the ARA from lateral radiographs, making quantification an exercise of only limited clinical value.\r"

Registration of colorectal cancer by the National Cancer Registry of New Zealand approached 100 percent by 1974. The present study was based on 15,395 individuals aged 25 years and over and registered for colorectal cancer between 1974 and 1983. Subsite distribution (right colon, left colon, rectum) for different age groups (25-49, 50-69, 70+ years) was significantly skewed, with an excess of right colonic cancer in individuals aged 25-49 years and 70+ years. This right colonic excess was accompanied by a relative reduction in left colonic cancer. Age adjusted incidence rates for the periods 1974-78 and 1979-83 were compared and stratified by age group and subsite. Incidence rates increased in all subsites in individuals aged 50+ years. This was particularly evident for right sided cancer in the elderly of both sexes. There was a marked reduction in the incidence of left colonic cancer and rectal cancer in individuals under 50 years. In contrast, the incidence of right colonic cancer remained relatively stable in young individuals. Time trend studies indicate that the skewed subsite distribution of large bowel cancer in different age groups may increase with time and is probably due to varying etiological factors acting on different cohorts.\r"

After a median follow-up of 42.5 months, the combined recurrence or persistence rate was 2.9 percent in group I and 40.6 percent in group II (P less than 0.0003, log-rank test). Recurrent abscesses or persistent fistulas were treated by secondary partial internal sphincterectomy. Comparing anal continence before and 1 year after definite treatment, we found increased anal function disturbances in 39.4 percent of the patients in group I and in 21.4 percent of the patients in group II (P less than 0.106, Fisher-exact test). The combined recurrence or persistence rate of 40.6 percent indicates that more than half of the patients with anorectal abscess will have no further problems after simple incision and drainage. This finding, as well as the increased anal function disturbances after partial internal sphincterectomy (either primary or secondary) are the main reasons to reserve fistulectomy as a second stage procedure if necessary.\r"

Hospitals vary in the proportions of patients from the local catchment area vs. those from more distant places, of whom a larger proportion are presumably referrals. To study the differences between these two types of patients, we analyzed 1,245 colorectal cancer patients seen at a large urban medical center over a seven-year period. Three hundred ninety-eight patients were from the local community (32 percent), 489 were from the extended community (39.3 percent), and 358 from more distant communities (28.8 percent). The patients from the local community tended to be older and from minority ethnic groups. In addition, the local community patients were more likely to have advanced disease at the time of presentation. The grade of the tumor and its site distribution within the large bowel were similar for the three groups. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and stage of disease, the survival was somewhat better for the distant community patients as compared with the local and extended communities (P less than 0.02). Overall, in our patient population, the distant patients tended to have more favorable socioeconomic factors and less advanced disease, and these differences may account, in large part, for a better prognosis for these patients. Particularly in large cooperative trials, studies may need to take into account the respective proportions of local community and geographically distant patients in analyzing and generalizing treatment outcomes.\r"

There was complete agreement between both observers in the analysis of anal resting and squeeze pressure as well as sphincter length. The pressure profiles from different days correlated significantly (P less than 0.01) with each other regardless of whether the studies were performed in the prepared or unprepared bowel. However, anal sphincter length and the quality of the anorectal inhibitory reflex varied greatly on different days. Male and female subjects showed major differences in the capacity of the anal sphincter to contract voluntarily (P less than 0.01), but resting tone and sphincter length were comparable in the two groups. It is concluded that pressure determinations in the anal canal are reliable and reproducible, but that alterations in the quality of the anorectal reflex need to be confirmed by repeated measurements before pathology is diagnosed.\r"

These findings were related to postoperative continence. Thirty-three patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (25 continent, eight with episodic minor incontinence) were studied 3 +/- 0.3 and 25 +/- 5 months after ileostomy takedown. The maximum resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly lower in patients with an imperfect result (35 +/- 5 mm Hg) than in continent patients (44 +/- 5 mm Hg) (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively the maximum squeeze anal pressure was slightly greater in continent than in incontinent patients (99 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 87 +/- 7 mm Hg) (P greater than 0.05). The postoperative recto-(ileo-)anal inhibitory reflex was present in 27 percent. The linear correlation between strength of rectal (ileal) distension and depth resp. duration of internal sphincter relaxation as preoperatively observed disappeared postoperatively in every group of patients. Simultaneous measurements of pouch and anal pressure in patients with imperfect results revealed a reduced positive pouch anal pressure gradient compared to the continent group. This low pouch-anal pressure gradient is thought to be responsible for the increased incidence of soiling in some of our patients.\r"

At laparotomy, tumors were present in the abdominal wall, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. Only a small part of the tumors was resected and diagnosed microscopically to be desmoid tumors. With prednisolone administration (20 to 5 mg/day) subjective symptoms were ameliorated and desmoid tumors slowly regressed.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight young-adult outpatients (mean age 22 yr) and six adolescent inpatients (mean age 14.5 yr) with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus participated in the intervention program. Nine adolescent inpatients (mean age 13.9 yr) served as an untreated comparison group. One adult outpatient with unreliable data was removed. Before treatment, each patient completed a minimum of 40 blood glucose estimations, blood glucose tests, and symptom-rating checklists. Symptoms of hypo- or hyperglycemia were identified for each patient. The three-session intervention focused on internal (e.g., personal symptoms) and external (e.g., timing and amount of insulin, food, and exercise) cues that could be used to enhance blood glucose awareness. At postintervention, patients completed a minimum of 40 additional blood glucose estimates and tests. Comparison subjects completed the pre-postassessments but did not receive the intervention. RESULTS: Blood glucose estimation accuracy was evaluated with error grid analysis. All estimated-actual blood glucose values were plotted into one of five zones: accurate estimates (zone A), benign errors (zone B), and clinically dangerous errors (zones C, D, and E). An overall accuracy index (AI) was calculated by subtracting the summed percentage of clinically dangerous estimates (zones C, D, and E) from the percentage of accurate estimates (zone A). At study entry, the adolescent inpatients' mean AI of 7% was significantly poorer than the 32% mean AI exhibited by the outpatient young-adult sample (P less than 0.02). At postintervention, the adolescents' mean AI improved to 30% (P less than 0.02) and the young adults' mean outpatient AI improved to 45% (P less than 0.06). The treated sample as a whole exhibited increased sensitivity to both hypo- (P less than 0.005) and hyperglycemia (P less than 0.05). Similar improvements did not occur in the untreated comparison sample. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents may exhibit poorer blood glucose awareness than adults. Although this intervention program improved blood glucose awareness in both adolescent and adult patients, postintervention blood glucose estimation accuracy remained far from ideal.\r"

RESULTS: Black children had higher insulin dosages (P less than 0.05) and lower SESs (P less than 0.001) than white children. HbA1 was higher in black than white children (P less than 0.01) after statistically adjusting for the effects of insulin dose, diabetes duration, and SES. With HbA1-based criteria, more black than white children were in poor and fewer in good metabolic control (P less than 0.001). Older children (greater than or equal to 13 yr) had higher HbA1 levels than younger (less than 13 yr) children (P less than 0.002), but there were no differences in HbA1 between males and females nor were there interactive effects of race, sex, and age-group. Black children were hospitalized for DKA more frequently than white children (P less than 0.04). More black than white children missed clinic visits (P less than 0.01), but they did not differ in number of visits kept.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Comparison of eye examination performed by diabetologists with direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil and by ophthalmologists through a dilated pupil with seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography (gold standard). The study consisted of 67 insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic outpatients attending a diabetes clinic. RESULTS: On the basis of fundus photography, patients were classified as having no or insignificant (30%), minimal (31%), moderate (24%), or severe (15%) retinopathy. The diabetologists and ophthalmologists performed similarly in their ability to classify severity of diabetic retinopathy accurately. When no or insignificant retinopathy (isolated microaneurysms only) was detected by examination, clinically significant retinopathy detected by fundus photography was highly unlikely (less than 5%). On the other hand, if more than isolated microaneurysms were seen on examination, all examiners missed more severe lesions detected by fundus photography. Patients with corrected visual acuity worse than 20/30 had a high likelihood (100%) of moderate or severe retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Motivated well-trained diabetologists can screen for diabetic retinopathy. The absence of detectable lesions by direct ophthalmoscopy indicates that automatic referral to an ophthalmologist is not necessary. However, if any level of retinopathy is detected or corrected acuity is worse than 20/30, referral to an ophthalmologist is required. In this setting, fundus photography is advised because it is the most sensitive means of detecting clinically significant retinopathy. If other nonophthalmologists can be trained to achieve similar results, current recommendations for ophthalmologic referral that require annual ophthalmologic examinations for most diabetic patients may need to be reconsidered.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted by a mail survey being sent to all optometrists in New York whom we could identify through state sources (n = 2270). Three follow-up mailings were conducted. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent who received our mailing responded, 87% of whom reported that they see diabetic patients. Analysis was confined to this 87%. Routine retinal examinations were provided by 68% of the respondents who see diabetic patients, 62% of whom dilate the pupils. Sixty-eight percent who see diabetic patients diagnose retinopathy solely by their own examination, and 60% of these dilate. Follow-up of retinopathy was provided by 15% of optometrists who see diabetic patients, 90% of whom dilate the pupils of their diabetic patients. Twenty-five percent of respondents who see diabetic patients refer them to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis of retinopathy, and 67% refer all retinopathy patients to an ophthalmologist for follow-up. Although 91% of respondents recommended eye examinations at least annually for diabetic patients, only 68% specifically recommended annual examinations through dilated pupils. Those who dilate were significantly more likely to recommend annual dilated examinations than those who do not dilate, regardless of practice setting. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that optometrists as a group see many diabetic patients. Intervention strategies should include increased emphasis on the use of dilation when examining diabetic patients and annual dilated retinal examinations.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twelve insulin-treated patients (6 receiving human soluble insulin, 6 receiving beef soluble insulin) participated in the study. Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure ITP in serial samples from vials stored in various laboratory environments or issued to patients. Vials in the laboratory were analyzed on nine occasions over 26 wk; those issued to patients were analyzed weekly. RESULTS: Results were expressed as rates of change (% total protein/wk). Except for human insulin stored at 4 degrees C, sampling did not accelerate transformation. Storage at higher temperatures caused more rapid transformation to all ITP groups, and human insulin was more susceptible than beef insulin. Exposure to light accelerated transformation mainly to group 3 ITP. Fibrillation occurred in beef but not human insulin carried in a shirt pocket. Results from patients' vials were consistent with reported storage conditions. CONCLUSIONS: All three ITP groups form in human and beef soluble insulin. Their rate of production is a function of temperature and light exposure. Differences between the two insulins were probably due to differences in formulation. Patients should be discouraged from hoarding vials and storing insulin in direct sunlight. One or more ITPs could contribute to the residual immunogenicity of modern insulin preparations.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: IAAs were determined by radiobinding assay (RBA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in two large age-matched groups of nondiabetic and newly diagnosed insulin-dependent (type I) diabetic children. RESULTS: Positivity for IAA by RBA (greater than or equal to nondiabetic mean + 3SD) was 2 of 178 (1.1%) and 55 of 173 (32%) in nondiabetic and diabetic children, respectively. Prevalence of IAA by RBA was significantly higher in the youngest age-group (63% between 0-4 yr). Positivity for IAA by ELISA was 1 of 178 (0.6%) and 8 of 169 (4.7%) in nondiabetic and diabetic children, respectively. Concordance rates between both assays were 0 of 3 (0%) in control subjects and 5 of 58 (8.6%) in diabetic children. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RBA is more appropriate than ELISA for IAA detection at the onset of the disease. In addition, because available data suggest that IAAs detected by RBA only are high-affinity antibodies, it is tempting to speculate that IAAs reflect a mature immune reaction against endogenous insulin.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sera were obtained from 59 diabetic patients, 44 chronically ill nondiabetic patients, and 34 age-matched healthy control subjects. Mononuclear cells were isolated from a subgroup of diabetic patients and healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Except for a modest increase in the prevalence of detectable serum TNF levels in diabetic patients, the serum cytokines measured in this study did not appear to be altered in diabetes. In vitro TNF production by mononuclear cells was not altered in diabetic patients. However, in vitro IL-1 beta secretion, in response to lipopolysaccharides, was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus is not associated with significant changes in serum levels of TNF, IL-1 alpha, or IL-1 beta. In vitro secretion of IL-1 beta in response to lipopolysaccharides may be reduced in diabetes.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The intestinal hormone motilin has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Therefore, we examined the effect of intravenous motilin on gastric emptying of a 99mTc colloid-labeled semisolid test meal in 9 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic gastroparesis. All patients had a significantly delayed gastric emptying rate compared with a group of 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the infusion of motilin, gastric emptying was accelerated, and it was no longer significantly different from control values. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that motilin and related compounds such as erythromycin derivatives could be useful for the treatment of disturbed gastric emptying in diabetic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the possibility of inhibiting protein glycosylation in vivo with vitamin E. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two groups of 10 insulin-requiring diabetic patients, matched for duration of disease and metabolic control, received daily vitamin E supplementation of 1200 and 600 mg, respectively, for 2 mo. A third group of 10 diabetic patients, matched for duration of disease and metabolic control, served as the control group and received placebo. Fasting plasma glucose, mean daily plasma glucose, fasting labile HbA1, and glycosylated proteins were measured in the basal state and after 1 and 2 mo of treatment. In addition, hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed in basal state and after 1 mo of vitamin E administration in all patients. RESULTS: Glycemic indices did not show any significant changes during the study, whereas fasting labile HbA, and glycosylated proteins decreased significantly after 1 and 2 mo in patients on vitamin E administration. Stable HbA1 decreased after 2 mo. Mean glycemic incremental area in the hyperglycemic clamp procedure was similar before and after treatment, whereas a significant reduction in mean labile HbA1 incremental area was found after vitamin E supplementation. A significant difference was also found in both fasting and incremental labile HbA1 levels, stable HbA1, and glycosylated proteins between the two groups of diabetic patients on the two doses of vitamin E; the diabetic patients who received the higher dose of vitamin E showed the greater reduction. No significant changes in these parameters were observed in diabetic patients on placebo administration. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that vitamin E administration may reduce protein glycosylation in diabetic subjects independently of changes in plasma glucose, an effect that may be due to the inhibition of labile glycosylation, the first step of the Maillard reaction. Long-term studies will help establish the usefulness of vitamin E administration for the prevention of diabetic complications.\r"

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were recruited from a general diabetes clinic where patients were screened for neuropathy, retinopathy, and elevated plantar foot pressure. Sixty-four patients in five groups were matched by age and sex in the following groups: group 1, patients with LJM and neuropathy; group 2, nonneuropathic diabetic patients with LJM; group 3, patients with neuropathy and no LJM; group 4, diabetic control subjects; and group 5, nondiabetic control subjects. Joint mobility was assessed in the foot at subtalar and metatarsophalangeal joints; plantar foot pressures were assessed by optical pedobarography and neuropathic status by a Biothesiometer and electrophysiology. RESULTS: Joint mobility was reduced at both sites in groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3, 4, and 5 (P less than 0.001). Plantar foot pressures were significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 compared with groups 3, 4, and 5 (P less than 0.001). No differences in plantar foot pressures were observed between groups 1 and 2. There were strong correlations between plantar foot pressures and joint mobility in the foot (r = -0.7, P less than 0.001). Previous foot ulceration was present in 65% of patients in group 1, none in group 2, and 5% in group 3. CONCLUSIONS: 1) LJM may be a major factor in causing abnormally high plantar foot pressures, 2) abnormal plantar foot pressures alone do not lead to foot ulceration, and 3) LJM contributes to foot ulceration in the susceptible neuropathic foot.\r"

  ".W": "The interstitial lung diseases are comprised of a group of pulmonary disorders characterized clinically by diffuse infiltrates on the chest radiograph and histologically by distortion of the gas exchanging portion of the lung. The physiologic correlates are restriction of lung volumes and impaired oxygenation. The term \"interstitial\" when applied to these diseases is actually a misnomer because it implies that the inflammatory process is limited specifically to the area between the alveolar epithelial and capillary endothelial basement membranes. The diseases currently grouped as \"interstitial\" also frequently involve the alveolar epithelium, alveolar space, pulmonary microvasculature, and less commonly, the respiratory bronchioles, larger airways, and even the pleura. The enormous differential diagnosis of interstitial lung disease can be made manageable by understanding that pneumoconiosis, drug-induced disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis account for over 80% of the responsible entities and can usually be identified from the patient's history. The nine remaining diseases/disease categories include: sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia, histiocytosis X, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease, granulomatous vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, lymphomatoid granulomatosis), Goodpasture's syndrome, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The diagnosis of a specific interstitial lung disease can be made via various means including the patient's history, specific serologies, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and biopsy of extrathoracic tissues or open lung biopsy. A directed diagnostic approach can be formulated based on an understanding of these techniques and a thorough knowledge of the clinical presentations and specific diagnostic criteria for each of the major diseases. This monograph will serve as a guide for the clinician to use in evaluating and treating patients with interstitial lung disease. We begin by reviewing the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management of specific interstitial lung diseases excluding pulmonary infection, neoplasm, and sarcoidosis. Pneumoconiosis and drug-induced syndromes are not discussed in detail, but the agents responsible and pertinent exposures are presented in tabular form in the discussion of the general diagnostic approach.\r"

  ".W": "Subclinical generalized spike-wave discharges are often accompanied by transitory cognitive impairment, demonstrable by psychological testing during EEG recording. Transitory cognitive impairment is demonstrated most readily by difficult tasks and during generalized regular spike-wave bursts lasting for more than 3 s, but can also be found during briefer and even focal discharges. That this is not simply a consequence of global inattention is shown by the fact that focal discharges exhibit some specificity: left-sided focal spiking is more likely to produce errors on verbal tasks, for instance, whereas right-sided discharges are more often accompanied by impairment in handling nonverbal material. Both learning difficulties in general and specific abnormal patterns of cognitive functioning are well documented in children with epilepsy and are most pronounced in those with frequent interictal discharges. However, there is now evidence that intermittent cognitive impairment due to the discharges themselves contributes significantly to such neurophysiological abnormalities. The significance of transitory cognitive impairment accompanying subclinical EEG discharges for everyday functioning is uncertain, but there is experimental evidence that subclinical discharges may be accompanied by disruption of educational skills in children or by impairment of driving performance in motorists. In some individuals, suppression of discharges by antiepileptic drugs has demonstrably improved psychological function, but further work is required to determine the indications for such treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Learning difficulties in children with epilepsy may be caused by brain damage and should be investigated. In many cases, however, seizures and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) findings are the only signs of pathology. Frequency and type of seizures may be determining factors that should, if necessary, be evaluated by long-term EEG monitoring, preferably during school performance or in conjunction with neuropsychological assessment. This may prove that subclinical epileptiform discharges in the EEG can adversely affect the child's performance. Secondary psychological problems in epilepsy patients, combined with side effects of antiepileptic drugs, may cause or heighten learning problems. Prophylactic control of seizures with one appropriate drug may alleviate learning problems. Computerized neuropsychological testing with simultaneous EEG recording may reveal the influence of epileptiform discharges on cognitive function and also help to evaluate the effects of antiepileptic drugs. Objective assessment of subclinical epileptiform activity makes it easier to treat the pathology identified by the EEG with optimal dosage of the most appropriate drug. A balance is required because epileptiform discharges and even occasional seizures may be less disabling than side effects from large doses of several drugs. Information to the school and the parents concerning the patient's abilities and limitations may be as important as seizure control. Specialized teaching should be started early, when necessary, with the patient integrated into a normal school if possible. However, good functioning in a special school is preferable to marginal functioning in a normal school.\r"

Some of the differences between results may be attributed to the psychological tests used and to age differences. However, there appears to be a dissociation between AEDs that affect higher cognitive function, e.g., phenytoin, and those mainly affecting motor function, e.g., carbamazepine, which appears to increase speed of performance, AEDs should be prescribed with care in children with epilepsy, taking account of their differing effects on cognitive function and behavior.\r"

The speed of performance tended to increase with age in both groups, with differences in information processing becoming apparent from the age of 12 years. The precise control of stimulus and response required to define the mainly minor differences between the epilepsy and control groups can only be fulfilled by computerized testing, which should undergo further refinement including voice and language recognition, followed by artificial intelligence.\r"

It is possible that some classes of antibiotic agents, such as the penicillins or the quinolones, may have minimal effects on male fertility and maintain the clinical efficacy for patients requiring long-term antibiotic suppressive therapy. Further investigation is needed into the relative toxicity of antibiotics and the mechanisms by which antibiotics affect spermatogenesis and spermatozoal function.

Patients with stage I disease had an average fecundity of 10.30% with decreasing values observed in stage II (7.59%), anovulation (6.67%), and more than one infertility factor (3.33%). We conclude that laparoscopic cauterization is an effective mode of therapy for the treatment of stage I and II endometriosis associated with infertility.\r"

Two hundred forty-four ovulatory cycles in 48 normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic patients were evaluated. The cumulative conception rate after 12 cycles was 93%, with a mean conception rate of 22.5% per cycle. Comparing cycles 1 to 6 with cycles 7 to 12, no significant difference in conception rate was observed. Subdivisions were made relative to the presence of additional infertility factors, history of weight loss, actual weight, estrogenic status, and primary versus secondary amenorrhea. The life table curves of patients either with or without other infertility factors were significantly different. No statistically significant differences were found in the other subdivisions. It is concluded that IV GnRH therapy is highly successful in patients with normogonadotropic and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea, especially if no other infertility factors are present.\r"

The new users were compared with a control group of 696 women who had used various OCs for at least 6 months. The incidence of BTB in the control group was 16.8% and in the new users was 24.9%, 17.5%, and 15.3% in the first 3 months, respectively. Breakthrough bleeding occurred late in the 7-7-7 package in 58% and early or midway through the package in 17% and 25%, respectively. We hypothesized that late-package BTB would improve if the patient was switched to a monophasic pill similar to the relatively estrogenic formulation of the beginning of the package and vice versa for early or midpackage BTB. Seventy women with BTB at 3 months were randomly given 0.5/35 or 1/35 for a further 3 months. Breakthrough bleeding was more likely (P less than 0.05) to improve in women switched to 1/35 compared with 0.5/35 regardless of where in the package BTB occurred.\r"

The number of endometrial epithelial cell colonies showed a large variation (1 to 200 or more PF sample). No significant distinction in incidence and number of cell colonies was found between women with minimal (n = 11) and without endometriosis (n = 12). A significant correlation with number of cell colonies was found in women with infertility and no mechanical and male infertility factors. These data indicate that retrograde transport of viable endometrial cells during menstruation occurs in most women with patent tubes. Implications of the results for the relation between retrograde menstruation, endometriosis, and infertility are discussed.\r"

Antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis were found four times more often in patients with signs of prior pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) than in infertile women with normal pelvic findings. Only 48 (37%) of 131 patients with signs of prior PID had a history of PID. Ten or more C. trachomatis elementary bodies (EBs) per smear were found in 21 (8.2%) of 256 patients. Six patients had a positive culture or a positive antigen EIA test. All six had high numbers of EBs in the DFA test. We conclude that routine culture and EIA antigen tests detect only a minority of persistent chlamydia infections in this population, but subjective factors in the interpretation of DFA methods must be considered.\r"

As a consequence of the treatment, 23 pregnancies were obtained, with pregnancy rates of 23% per cycle and 32% per patient for unexplained infertility and 11% and 17% for male subfertility. Pregnancy loss rate was quite elevated: 9 clinical abortions and 1 ectopic.

A significant reduction in adhesion formation was only observed with the combination of INTERCEED(TC7) plus heparin. In addition studies, heparin delivery by intraperitoneal (IP) lavage, intravenous injection, or intra-abdominal instillation failed to demonstrate efficacy. Similarly, heparin delivery with other barriers or IP instillates (carboxymethylcellulose or 32% Dextran 70) failed to reduce adhesion formation. We conclude that INTERCEED(TC7) can be efficaciously utilized as a carrier to deliver heparin to traumatized surfaces, thereby reducing adhesion formation.\r"

Furthermore, because C3 is capable of producing many of the immunological activities known to be associated with human endometriosis, we studied the production, secretion, and regulation of C3 using the rat model for endometriosis. Endometriosis was surgically induced in 20 adult female rats. The animals were then ovariectomized and one half were treated with estradiol (E2) for 3 days. Uterine luminal epithelial cells synthesized and secreted C3 only after E2 administration, whereas the uteri from control animals did not produce C3. In contrast, the ectopic endometrium from control animals produced and secreted C3, and this expression was strongly upregulated by in vivo E2 administration. We conclude that surgically induced endometriosis in the rat has properties biochemically independent from the intact uterus and may serve as a useful model to further investigate the regulation of C3 synthesis from human endometriosis.\r"

We utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis to visualize proteins produced by the uteri and endometriotic implants of both steroid-treated and reproductively cyclic rats with and without surgically induced endometriosis. Of the greater than 300 proteins visualized, only the uterine cultures from progesterone (P)-stimulated, estrogen-suppressed rats contained a distinctive glycoprotein (P-induced uterine protein-1; molecular weight [Mr] 70,000; isoelectric point [pI] 5.7). This protein was not detected in any of the endometriotic implant cultures. Progesterone-induced uterine protein-1 could play a role in luteal or endometrial physiology and may be valuable in assessing endometrial function. The aberrant secretory behavior of the ectopic endometrium suggests a possible involvement in the reproductive dysfunction associated with endometriosis.\r"

Explant volume was significantly reduced in all treatment groups, an effect that was more significant in animals treated for greater than or equal to 4 weeks compared with those treated for only 2 weeks. We conclude that GnRH-a treatment caused gradual regression of endometrial explant that was effectively complete by 4 weeks of treatment.

We report herein a case of ureteral injury resulting from operative laparoscopy for endometriosis. The injury was diagnosed and treated via laparoscopy during the same procedure. The increased utilization of operative laparoscopy to perform more complex procedures increases the potential for operative injury to the ureter. Prior visualization or retroperitoneal dissection of the ureter, in appropriate cases, will help reduce this complication and/or permit a prompt diagnosis in the event of such injury.\r"

  ".W": "Since the 1940s, numerous cases of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have been observed in certain American Indian populations. Extremely high prevalence rates of NIDDM occur most strikingly in several tribes of Paleo-Indians, whose ancestors migrated to North America greater than 11,000 yr ago. Archaeological evidence from that period indicates that certain groups of Paleo-Indians maintained an arctic-like hunter-gatherer life-style in an area in temperate North America ranging from Wyoming to Arizona. This life-style featured a reliance on unpredictable big game species as a major food source. However, at this time, big game species were becoming extinct. It is hypothesized that those Paleo-Indians who relied on big game as a food source developed a \"thrifty\" genotype that allowed a selective advantage during the periods of fasting that occurred between big game kills. It also is hypothesized that this thrifty genotype in these Indians may contribute to NIDDM when a sedentary life-style is adopted and food sources are constant. Because insulin resistance in muscle is a major feature of NIDDM, it is possible that insulin resistance per se is the phenotypic expression of the thrifty genotype.\r"

  ".W": "In 1960, immunoassays of insulin first demonstrated significant quantities of circulating hormone in non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes and for 30 yr have fostered debate as to whether a beta-cell abnormality plays an etiological role in this syndrome. Early efforts to determine the adequacy of islet beta-cell function showed that obesity and its associated insulin resistance were major confounding variables. Subsequently, it was recognized that glucose not only directly regulated insulin synthesis and secretion but moderated all other islet signals, including other substrates, hormones, and neural factors. When both obesity and glucose are taken into account, it becomes clear that patients with fasting hyperglycemia all have abnormal islet function. Type II diabetes is characterized by a defect in first-phase or acute glucose-induced insulin secretion and a deficiency in the ability of glucose to potentiate other islet nonglucose beta-cell secretagogues. The resulting hyperglycemia compensates for the defective glucose potentiation and maintains nearly normal basal insulin levels and insulin responses to nonglucose secretagogues but does not correct the defect in first-phase glucose-induced insulin release. Before the development of fasting hyperglycemia, only first-phase glucose-induced insulin secretion is obviously defective. This is because progressive islet failure is matched by rising glucose levels to maintain basal and second-phase insulin output. The relationship between islet function and fasting plasma glucose is steeply curvilinear, so that there is a 75% loss of beta-cell function by the time the diagnostic level of 140 mg/dl is exceeded. This new steady state is characterized by glucose overproduction and inefficient utilization. Insulin resistance is also present in most patients and contributes to the hyperglycemia by augmenting the glucose levels needed for compensation. Decompensation and absolute hypoinsulinemia occur when the renal threshold for glucose is exceeded and prevents further elevation of circulating glucose. The etiology of the islet beta-cell lesion is not known, but a hypothesis based on basal hyperproinsulinemia and islet amyloid deposits in the pancreas of type II diabetes is reviewed. The recent discovery of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin, which is the major constituent of islet amyloid deposits, is integrated into this hypothesis. It is suggested that pro-IAPP and proinsulin processing and mature peptide secretion normally occur together and that abnormal processing, secondary to or in conjunction with defects in hormone secretion, lead to progressive accumulation of intracellular IAPP and pro-IAPP, which in cats, monkeys, and humans form intracellular fibrils and amyloid deposits with a loss of beta-cell mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

By 20 wk after surgery, an adaptation to pancreatectomy was apparent from results of serial glucose tolerance tests, done in a preliminary protocol. Some of the rats also received dexamethasone (ShamDex and PxDex, respectively), imposing insulin resistance. Insulin secretion was assessed with the acute insulin response to arginine under basal (AIRbas) and maximum glucose-potentiated (AIRmax) states. Pancreatic insulin was measured, and insulin synthesis was estimated by measurement of proinsulin mRNA. At 1 wk after surgery, there was no difference among Sham and Px rats in AIRbas, but in the Px rats, expected reductions of AIRmax, pancreatic insulin, and proinsulin mRNA were found. ShamDex rats had a markedly augmented AIRbas and increased AIRmax and proinsulin mRNA. However, pancreatic insulin was reduced both in ShamDex and PxDex rats. At 20 wk after surgery, the predicted adaptation to Px was substantiated by AIRmax and proinsulin mRNA in Px rats not different from those in Sham rats, but pancreatic insulin in the Px rats remained low. AIRbas and proinsulin mRNA were augmented in ShamDex and PxDex rats, but pancreatic insulin was again reduced, and in PxDex rats, low AIRmax and fed hyperglycemia were seen. Linear correlations of AIRbas and AIRmax with proinsulin mRNA were observed over a roughly fourfold range of secretion and synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We report that the beta-subunit also contains O-linked oligosaccharides. The proreceptor, alpha-subunit, and beta-subunit were labeled with [3H]mannose and [3H]galactose in the presence or absence of an inhibitor of O-linked glycosylation. Tryptic peptides from each component were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. N- and O-linked oligosaccharide chains were identified on these peptides by specific enzymatic digestions. The proreceptor and alpha-subunit contained only N-linked oligosaccharides, whereas the beta-subunit contained both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. The O-linked oligosaccharide chains were attached to a single tryptic fraction of the beta-subunit, which also contained N-linked chains. This fraction was further localized to the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide of the beta-subunit by specific immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody with specificity for this region. Binding of insulin and autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit were not dependent on O-linked glycosylation, because cells grown in the presence of the inhibitor exhibited a normal dose response to insulin. Therefore, the insulin receptor contains O-linked oligosaccharides on the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide of the beta-subunit, and these O-linked oligosaccharides are not necessary to the binding or autophosphorylation function of the receptor.\r"

Median age at diagnosis of diabetes was 9.2 yr (range 0.04-26.2 yr), and median duration of the disease was 15.3 yr (range 10.0-37.2 yr). Sixty-three percent of the patients were Ashkenazi Jews, and 37% were non-Ashkenazi Jews. HbA1 was evaluated every 3 mo in the last 10 yr of follow-up, and albumin excretion rate was tested in three 24-h urine collections. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed every year since diagnosis of diabetes, and if retinal pathology was suspected, color photographs were taken. Microalbuminuria was detected in 31% and macroalbuminuria in 7% of the patients. Nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy was found in 44 and 12% of the patients, respectively. On logistic regression analysis, two variables were significantly and independently associated with diabetic nephropathy--non-Ashkenazi origin and mean HbA1 values over the first 5 of 10 yr of follow-up. Variables significantly and independently related to diabetic retinopathy were non-Ashkenazi origin, mean HbA1 values over the last 10 yr of follow-up, and duration of diabetes. Because non-Ashkenazi Jews in Israel are of lower socioeconomic status than Ashkenazi Jews, we stratified our patients according to their socioeconomic parameters, median HbA1 values, and duration of diabetes. Non-Ashkenazi patients were at a higher risk to develop complications in all strata.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Growth was studied prospectively in 12 nondiabetic identical twins aged less than 14 yr and in their co-twins with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) to determine whether changes in growth occur before the onset of IDDM. Seven of the 12 nondiabetic twins subsequently developed IDDM; the remainder are now unlikely to become diabetic. A significantly reduced growth velocity was observed more frequently in the nondiabetic twins (7 of 12) than in their diabetic co-twins (1 of 12; P = 0.03). Of the 7 nondiabetic twins who were prediabetic, 6 had a reduction in growth velocity to below the 3rd percentile before the onset of diabetes compared with 1 of their diabetic co-twins (P = 0.03). However, only 1 of the 5 nondiabetic twins who did not develop diabetes showed a reduction in growth velocity. The nadir of growth in the twins who developed diabetes occurred a mean of 1.2 yr before diagnosis (range 0.3-2.3 yr). All 7 of the prediabetic twins had islet cell antibodies when first seen, and 3 had them before they showed either decreased growth velocity or impaired glucose tolerance. In 4 prediabetic twins, the decreased growth preceded impaired glucose tolerance. The prediabetic twins tested had lower testosterone or estradiol levels at the time they showed decreased growth than their diabetic twins. We conclude that decreased growth velocity is an early sensitive marker of IDDM.\r"

Stereotypy was attenuated in chronically hyperglycemic diabetic rats but normalized in insulin-treated diabetic rats. Stereotypy in insulin-withdrawn rats was intermediate, being attenuated significantly relative to controls but not significantly different from either insulin-treated diabetic rats or chronically hyperglycemic diabetic rats. DA turnover was significantly reduced in striatum and hypothalamus in all diabetic groups. 5-HT turnover was reduced in chronically hyperglycemic diabetic rats in all four brain regions but normalized in insulin-treated diabetic rats. Insulin-withdrawn diabetic rats had significantly reduced 5-HT turnover in frontal cortex. Taken together, the findings indicate that insulin replacement does not normalize diabetes-induced reduction in DA turnover and that short-term insulin withdrawal, e.g., occurring clinically with noncompliance, affects both 5-HT turnover in some brain regions and behavior.\r"

A preferential impairment of aerobic relative to total glycolysis was found in islets from diabetic rats incubated at either low or high D-glucose concentration. This coincided in islet mitochondria of diabetic rats with a severe decrease in both the basal (no-Ca2+) generation of 3H2O from L-[2-3H]glycerol-3-phosphate and the Ca2(+)-induced increment in [3H]glycerophosphate detritiation. The mitochondria of diabetic rats were also less efficient than those of control animals in generating 14CO2 from [1-14C]-2-ketoglutarate. The diabetes-induced alteration of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in islet mitochondria was less marked, however, than that of the FAD-linked glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and was not associated with any change in responsiveness to Ca2+. Sonicated islet mitochondria of diabetic rats displayed normal to slightly elevated glutamate dehydrogenase activity. We propose, therefore, that the preferential impairment of the oxidative and secretory responses of islet cells to D-glucose in this experimental model of diabetes may be at least partly attributable to an altered transfer of reducing equivalents into the mitochondria as mediated by the glycerol phosphate shuttle.\r"

A supplement of vitamin E decreased plasma triglycerides, platelet lipid biosynthesis, some of the delta 6- and delta 5-desaturase abnormalities, and urine ketone bodies but did not affect the response of platelets to aggregation. PP-56 completely normalized the platelet reactivity to ADP and thrombin. This was accompanied by normalization of platelet lipid biosynthesis and diabetes-induced abnormalities in delta 6- and delta 5-desaturases. PP-56 treatment also reduced the mortality rate and to a certain extent urinary ketone bodies. The protective effect of PP-56 on platelet aggregation and mortality rate were dose related. PP-56, a molecule derived from phytic acid, seems to exert potent protective effects on some of the manifestations associated with diabetes in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance to insulin action is a well-established feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and is believed to contribute to the etiology of this condition. A strong genetic contribution to the etiology of NIDDM exists, and we previously identified an insulin-receptor gene restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) associated with the NIDDM phenotype. In an attempt to elucidate whether structural defects in the insulin receptor could be a primary cause of insulin resistance in NIDDM, we analyzed the insulin-receptor cDNA sequence in a subject with NIDDM who is also homozygous for this RFLP. The insulin-receptor cDNA was sequenced with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA from transformed lymphocytes was reverse transcribed and amplified with five overlapping sets of primers that span the coding sequence of both alpha- and beta-subunits. No difference was found in the predicted amino acid sequence of the subject's insulin receptor compared with the normal insulin receptor. At nucleotide positions 831 and 2247, the subject is heterozygous for silent nucleotide polymorphisms that do not affect the amino acid sequence. Exon 11 encodes a 12-amino acid insert in the alpha-subunit, which, due to alternate splicing, is not expressed in lymphocyte insulin-receptor mRNA. Consequently, exon 11 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR; the sequence of exon 11 was found to be normal. In addition, when this patient's transformed lymphocytes were maintained in culture, no abnormalities in insulin binding were observed. We conclude that the insulin resistance seen in this NIDDM subject is not due to a structural alteration in the insulin receptor itself.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the role of glucose, insulin, and glucagon in the activation of glycogen catabolism in cultured human hepatocytes. Basal glycogenolysis in unstimulated human hepatocytes was low (only 19% of initial glycogen content was degraded in a 4-h incubation) and insensitive to changes in external glucose concentration (from 10 to 0 mM). Both glycogenolysis and glucose output could be significantly stimulated by 35 ng/L glucagon or 10(5) pM dibutyryl cAMP; half-maximal effect was found with 28 x 10(2) ng/L glucagon and 4 x 10(5) pM dibutyryl cAMP. After a 3-h exposure to 35 x 10(3) ng/L glucagon, greater than 90% of glycogen content of human hepatocytes was mobilized. This caused a 4.6-fold increase in the rate of glucose output to the medium compared with nonstimulated cells. About 85% of degraded glycogen rendered glucose to the medium. Insulin (10(4) pM) was able to totally suppress basal glycogenolysis; insulin was also essential to reverse the action of glucagon in hepatocytes incubated with glucagon, whereas glucose alone, even at postprandial concentration, was unable to reverse glucagon action. In summary, these experiments show that the mobilization of glycogen stores of human hepatocytes, as it occurs during the postabsorptive periods in humans, is largely dependent on the presence of glucagon and is not simply due to a decrease of external glucose. Insulin, on the other hand, was essential to suppress both basal and glucagon-activated glycogenolysis.\r"

  ".W": "The diabetic syndrome in BioBreeding (BB) rats is believed to result from the destruction of beta-cells by autoimmune responses. However, the initial events that cause the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells remain largely unknown. This investigation was initiated to see whether there are any antigenic changes on the beta-cells from neonatal to adult BB rats that may lead to the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells. Pancreatic grafts from neonatal BB rats remained largely intact without insulitis when transplanted into the renal subcapsular space of acutely diabetic BB rats. Similarly transplanted islet grafts from neonatal BB rats were also not subject to autoimmune destruction. In contrast, islet grafts obtained from adult BB rats, which had been treated with silica to prevent insulitis, were rapidly destroyed in diabetic recipients. These results indicate that beta-cells from neonatal BB rats are different from beta-cells from adult BB rats, at least regarding their recognition by immunologic effectors. Considering our observations and previous information on the initial role of macrophages/dendritic cells in the development of insulitis in BB rats, we suggest that beta-cell-specific antigenic changes that precede insulitis may result in the autoimmune destruction of beta-cells in BB rats.\r"

We determined whether alterations in the expression of the insulin-regulatable (IR) and/or HepG2 glucose-transporter (GT) mRNAs were similarly affected. There was a significantly higher level of IRGT mRNA in skeletal muscle from exercise-trained versus sedentary high-fat-fed rats (27% increase, P less than 0.01). This difference is consistent with previously reported increases in muscle insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Skeletal muscle HepG2GT mRNA was too low to detect any training effect, but there was a tendency toward higher levels with training in cardiac muscle. In contrast, dietary manipulation, previously shown to lead to a much greater increase (100-300%) in muscle insulin-mediated glucose uptake, did not change IRGT or HepG2GT mRNA in skeletal muscle or heart. Thus, both dietary manipulation and exercise training increase insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, but only exercise training increases IRGT mRNA. Therefore, exercise training apparently increases GT production, whereas dietary manipulation improves glucose transport in skeletal muscle by other mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "High levels of some but not all dietary fats lead to insulin resistance in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the important determinants underlying this observation. Insulin action was assessed with the euglycemic clamp. Diets high in saturated, monounsaturated (omega-9), or polyunsaturated (omega-6) fatty acids led to severe insulin resistance; glucose infusion rates [GIR] to maintain euglycemia at approximately 1000 pM insulin were 6.2 +/- 0.9, 8.9 +/- 0.9, and 9.7 +/- 0.4 mg.kg-1. min-1, respectively, versus 16.1 +/- 1.0 mg.kg-1.min-1 in chow-fed controls. Substituting 11% of fatty acids in the polyunsaturated fat diet with long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils normalized insulin action (GIR 15.0 +/- 1.3 mg.kg-1.min-1). Similar replacement with short-chain omega-3 (alpha-linolenic acid, 18:3 omega 3) was ineffective in the polyunsaturated diet (GIR 9.9 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) but completely prevented the insulin resistance induced by a saturated-fat diet (GIR 16.0 +/- 1.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) and did so in both the liver and peripheral tissues. Insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle was inversely correlated with mean muscle triglyceride accumulation (r = 0.95 and 0.86 for soleus and red quadriceps, respectively; both P less than 0.01). Furthermore, percentage of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid in phospholipid measured in red quadriceps correlated highly with insulin action in that muscle (r = 0.97). We conclude that 1) the particular fatty acids and the lipid environment in which they are presented in high-fat diets determine insulin sensitivity in rats; 2) impaired insulin action in skeletal muscle relates to triglyceride accumulation, suggesting intracellular glucose-fatty acid cycle involvement; and 3) long-chain omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid of skeletal muscle may be important for efficient insulin action.\r"

It was found that the trypsin inhibitor N alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) counteracted the acute stimulatory effects of IL-1 beta on islet glucose oxidation, insulin release, and biosynthesis. TLCK also partially or completely counteracted the long-term inhibitory effects of IL-1 beta on islet glucose oxidation, insulin biosynthesis, content, and release. This protease inhibitor also counteracted IL-1 beta-induced beta-cell cytotoxicity as assessed by DNA content measurements. Of the other group-specific protease inhibitors investigated, only N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, and chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid were found to partially protect against IL-1 beta action. We concluded that protease activation, putatively a serine protease, may be an early and perhaps primary event in the action of IL-1 beta on beta-cells.\r"

We studied fibroblasts from a markedly insulin-resistant patient with NIDDM but without acanthosis nigricans. Her fibroblasts were resistant to insulin when alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake was measured. Fibroblasts from this patient demonstrated normal insulin-receptor content as measured by both insulin-receptor radioimmunoassay and by Scatchard analysis. However, when compared with nondiabetic control subjects, insulin-receptor kinase assays of wheat-germ-purified receptors prepared from her fibroblasts showed very low basal and no insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. The insulin receptor was then removed from the wheat-germ fraction by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. This insulin-receptor-deficient fraction inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity of highly purified insulin receptors. When the specificity of this inhibition was tested, less inhibition was seen with insulinlike growth factor I-receptor tyrosine kinase, and even less inhibition was seen with the proto-oncogene p60c-src tyrosine kinase. Thus, these studies indicate that fibroblasts from an insulin-resistant patient with NIDDM produce a relatively specific glycoprotein inhibitor of insulin-receptor tyrosine kinase. Therefore, these studies raise the possibility that this inhibitor may play an important role in the insulin resistance seen in this patient.\r"

We examined whether insulin receptors can be phosphorylated by an intermolecular mechanism. In this study, we used highly purified insulin receptors isolated from rat liver plasma membranes and human placental membranes. Rat liver insulin receptors were \"activated\" by incubation with 10 nM insulin in the presence of ATP. Subsequent to removal of insulin by immunodepletion, these receptors were used as an enzyme source to study phosphorylation of unphosphorylated \"substrate\" human receptors. Initially, we found no evidence that the addition of activated rat receptors increased phosphorylation of human receptors, when assessed by immunoprecipitation with a human-specific monoclonal antibody. To examine the possibility that these negative results were due to insufficient receptor concentration, activated human receptors were mixed with unphosphorylated substrate receptors at concentrations up to 60 micrograms/ml. In this study, we found that addition of activated receptors resulted in increased phosphorylation of the substrate receptors at the highest concentrations employed. These are the first data indicating that insulin receptors per se are capable of intermolecular phosphorylation. In vivo, this could be the initial step in amplifying the insulin-binding signal.\r"

For patients in whom alcohol abuse was excluded, ductal pathology was present in 25%. Abnormal ventral ductograms were present in only 8% of cases, demonstrating that dorsal ductography has an appreciable additional diagnostic yield.

Five patients required surgery--one for acute perforation and the other four for symptoms of continued obstruction, despite one to three additional attempts at dilation. Only three of seven patients with previous gastric resection had a satisfactory long-term result. Whereas endoscopic therapy initially cost one tenth to one fifth that of surgical intervention, such figures do not factor for loss of productivity, on the one hand, or potential need for chronic H2 blockade, on the other. Despite instruction to the contrary, only 6 of 15 (40%) active patients continue acid-suppressive therapy. We conclude that balloon dilation remains a viable alternative for selected patients with gastric outlet obstruction.\r"

Overall, obliteration was achieved in only 33% of the STD group and 25% of the MOR group; but in those patients who remained in the study over 3 months, obliteration was achieved in 87 and 83%, respectively (NS). There was a trend toward higher rebleeding in the STD group compared with the MOR group (81% vs. 51%) (p = 0.078), but there was no significant difference between the STD and MOR patients with regard to transfusion requirements (8.4 units/patient vs. 8.7 units/patient), ulceration (53% vs. 40%), or stricture formation (9.5% vs. 0.0%).

  ".W": "To assess reliability of the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa for diagnosing portal hypertension, 50 patients with portal hypertension and 1323 controls were studied. Endoscopic evidence of mild gastritis was seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension than in the control group (42% vs. 13.1%, p less than 0.001). The mosaic sign was also seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension compared with controls (14% vs. 0.9%, p less than 0.001). However, the mosaic sign was found to be nonspecific, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of portal hypertension was only 14%. Biopsy specimens from the stomach of all patients with portal hypertension and 100 controls with a normal endoscopic appearance revealed mucosal vascular congestion in 72% of patients with portal hypertension compared with 59% of controls (NS). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histologic evidence of congestive gastropathy. Similarly, there was no correlation between the severity of mucosal vascular congestion and the degree of inflammatory changes observed in the biopsy specimens; both in the control (r = 0.1) and in patients with portal hypertension (r = 0.14). It is concluded that endoscopic and histologic features of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension are of low sensitivity and nonspecific and cannot be used to diagnose portal hypertension.\r"

The diagnosis was based on the isolation of Y. enterocolitica in the feces and/or elevated serum antibody titers to the organism. Total colonoscopy was performed between 7 and 38 days (mean, 24 days) after the onset of symptoms. In all patients, the terminal ileum was affected, followed by frequent involvement of the ileocecal valve and the cecum, and less frequently, the ascending colon. In the terminal ileum, round or oval elevations with or without ulcers were detected. Small ulcers were detected on the ileocecal valve and in the cecum. These findings were observed even 4 to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms, suggesting a relatively long course for this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic biopsy specimens and surgically resected specimens in a collective series of 78 Japanese patients with ampullary tumor were retrospectively reviewed to investigate the clinical implications of endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were classified into five groups based on the degree of epithelial atypia: group 1 (no atypia), group 2 (mild atypia), group 3 (moderate atypia or adenoma), group 4 (severe atypia or carcinoma in situ), and group 5 (invasive carcinoma). Final diagnosis of the 78 resected ampullary tumors was adenoma in five cases, carcinoma in 27 cases, and both adenoma and carcinoma in 46 cases. Biopsy accuracy of carcinoma (group 4 or 5) was 70% (51 of 73) overall in 73 carcinoma cases. Biopsy accuracy was 50% (7 of 14) in the intramural protruding type, 64% (21 of 33) in the exposed protruding type, and 88% (23 of 26) in the ulcerating type. The diagnostic accuracy of adenoma (group 3) was 80% (4 of 5) in five cases of ampullary adenoma. In 18 (25%) of the 73 carcinoma cases, biopsy diagnosis was adenoma (group 3), whereas carcinoma was found in the deeper layers of surgically resected specimens. Biopsy diagnosis of adenoma does not rule out the possibility of deeper carcinoma in ampullary tumors.\r"

Neuroimaging has played an important role in evaluating the demented patient, and its uses are growing. Computed tomography (CT) is useful for excluding reversible and treatable causes of dementia, such as subdural hematoma and tumor. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved our ability to diagnose vascular disease and may show the presence of cerebral infarcts and white matter disease not visible on CT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), techniques that visualize such cerebral functions as glucose metabolism and blood flow, may provide positive evidence supportive of the diagnosis of AD.\r"

Treatment of hypertension and correction of other risk factors promoting atherosclerosis is appropriate in the elderly. Consideration should be given to a search for reversible causes of renal functional deterioration in elderly patients, particularly in those with increasingly refractory hypertension. In the uncomplicated elderly hypertensive, renal function appears to be adequately preserved if blood pressure is well controlled, although there may be a subset in whom factors other than blood pressure itself, such as glomerular hemodynamic disturbances, promote progressive renal dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The elderly are predisposed to various infections through a multitude of factors. Although intrinsic, unalterable defects occur in the aging immune system and nonspecific host defenses, there are factors that physician and patient can concentrate on to reduce the risk of infection. For example, meticulous attention to skin care can reduce the risk of soft tissue infection. Improvement in oral hygiene and relief of xerostomia might promote recolonization with normal oral flora. Correction of urinary tract obstruction where possible, relying on the use of indwelling urinary catheters only when necessary, can significantly reduce the risk of UTIs. Medications that impair cognitive function should be prescribed judiciously, since they can promote aspiration with subsequent pneumonia, xerostomia, and urinary retention. Correction of protein malnutrition may improve cell-mediated immunity and skin integrity, thereby reducing the risk of infection. The signs and symptoms of infection in the aged may be subtle. Therefore, the primary care physician should approach this susceptible population with a heightened clinical suspicion, thus expediting possibly life-saving early diagnosis and treatment.\r"

Surgery was followed by a reduction in acid reflux to a value similar to that in normal subjects. Patients in whom surgery was deemed to have failed had more reflux after the operation than those in whom it was successful, but no difference could be found in the preoperative reflux values of these two subgroups. Monitoring pH is not of value in selecting candidates for surgery since the results are not a good predictor of outcome, but it is useful in the objective evaluation of surgical results.\r"

Midazolam was the intravenous sedative used by a third of all respondents and 13% also used an additional intravenous agent, usually pethidine. Over the previous two years a total of 119 respiratory arrests, 37 cardiac arrests, and 52 deaths were identified. Adverse outcomes were reported more frequently by consultant physicians, by those who 'titrated' the intravenous sedative, and by those who used an additional intravenous agent, but were reported equally frequently by endoscopists using midazolam and endoscopists using diazepam. There is an urgent need for a prospective study to identify the circumstances and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes related to endoscopy.\r"

Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that the hypergastrinaemia in subjects with Helicobacter pylori infection is caused by the action of the ammonia produced by the organism's urease activity on the antral G cells. To investigate this hypothesis we examined the effect on plasma gastrin of increasing the bacterium's ammonia production by infusing urea intragastrically to eight H pylori positive duodenal ulcer patients. After a 60 minute control intragastric infusion of dextrose solution at 2 ml/minute, a similar infusion containing urea (50 mmol/l) was continued for four hours. During the urea infusion, the median gastric juice urea concentration rose from 1.1 mmol/l (range 0.3-1.6) to 15.5 mmol/l (range 7.9-21.3) and this resulted in an increase in the ammonium concentration from 2.3 mmol/l (range 1.3-5.9) to 6.1 mmol/l (range 4.2-11.9) (p less than 0.01). This appreciable rise in ammonia production did not result in any change in the plasma gastrin concentration. The experiment was repeated one month after eradication of H pylori, at which time the median basal gastrin was 20 ng/l (range 15-25), significantly less than the value before eradication (30 ng/l range 15-60) (p less than 0.05). On this occasion, the gastric juice ammonium concentration was considerably reduced at 0.4 mmol/l (range 0.1-0.9) and the urea infusion did not raise the ammonium concentration or change the plasma gastrin concentration. In conclusion, augmenting H pylori ammonia production does not cause any early change in plasma gastrin.\r"

Age standardised seroprevalence rates were lowest in combined social class categories I and II (49.2%), intermediate in categories IIIN and M (57.5%), and highest in categories IV and V (62.2%) (p = 0.01). In those aged 30-34 years, the prevalence rate for those in combined social class categories IV and V was 57.9% - double the rate for social class categories IIIM and N (28.3%) and five times the prevalence rate in those in social class categories I and II (11.1%). These differences in the infection patterns of H pylori by social class are consistent with patterns of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer.\r"

The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) can be used for indirect measurements of events in the jejunum. Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects. Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls. Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this investigation was to characterise these responses in isolated muscle from the human lower oesophageal sphincter. Electrical stimulation of enteric neurons produced a frequency dependent relaxation of the human lower oesophageal sphincter that was sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Furthermore, as previously shown in the opossum and canine lower oesophageal sphincter, cyclic guanosine monophosphate content was significantly raised in muscle strips frozen during maximum electrical field stimulation whereas cyclic adenosine monophosphate content was unchanged. In addition, sodium nitroprusside (EC50 = 0.1 microM) produced a concentration dependent relaxation of human lower oesophageal sphincter, significantly increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate content, but did not alter cyclic adenosine monophosphate content. Zaprinast (M&B 22948) and SK&F 94120, selective inhibitors of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterases, respectively, both relaxed human lower oesophageal sphincter with a potency similar to that seen in the dog or opossum lower oesophageal sphincter. Finally, the 8-bromo analogues of both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (EC50 = 420 microM) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (EC50 = 100 microM) relaxed the human lower oesophageal sphincter. These studies suggest that in the human, as well as the canine and opossum lower oesophageal sphincter, increases in cyclic nucleotide content are associated with relaxation and increases in cyclic guanosine monophosphate are associated with the relaxation induced by stimulation of enteric neurons.\r"

The immunological response was studied using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry. The antibody response to two protoplasmic antigen preparations of M paratuberculosis in the sera of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was measured by ELISA. IgG and IgM antibodies to these antigens were measured in serum samples from 52 patients with Crohn's disease, 15 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 41 control patients without inflammatory bowel disease. Although there was wide variation in the concentrations of antibody detected, patients with Crohn's disease had concentrations that were not significantly different from those of the other two groups. In addition, mycobacterial antigens were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the immune response to each antigen was then examined separately and assayed for IgG and IgM in 10 patients from each of the three groups. An indirect peroxidase test was also used to detect M paratuberculosis in sections of tissue from 18 patients with Crohn's disease and 10 with ulcerative colitis. The results were negative in all cases. This study does not support a role for M paratuberculosis in Crohn's disease.\r"

The purpose of this study was to confirm sulphation of phenols by isolated colonocytes from man and to evaluate mucosal sulphation in inflammatory bowel disease using the phenol, paracetamol, in rectal dialysis bags. The incubation of paracetamol with colonocytes isolated from resected colon specimens (n = 7) yielded a mean (SE) value of 7.0 (0.9) mumols/g dry weight of paracetamol sulphate after 60 minutes but virtually undetectable values of paracetamol glucuronide. Paracetamol sulphate was detected in rectal dialysates from all control subjects, with a mean (SE) value of 4.2 (0.8) nmol/hour. Sulphation was significantly impaired (p less than 0.01) in 19 patients with active ulcerative colitis (0.6 (0.2) nmol/hour) and in 17 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission (1.1 (0.4) nmol/hour). Sulphation in eight patients with Crohn's colitis (4.3 (2.1) nmol/hour) was similar to that in control subjects. Impairment of the capacity of the mucosa to sulphate phenols in quiescent and active ulcerative colitis may pose a metabolic burden on colonic epithelial cells, which are continuously exposed to endogenous phenols from the colonic lumen.\r"

C albicans was grown to a stationary phase in broth culture and suspended in phosphate buffered saline at 10(7) organisms/ml. Neutrophils and Candida were then incubated together at 37 degrees C in a shaking water bath in the presence of fresh serum. At 30 and 60 minutes samples were withdrawn, neutrophils lysed, and Candida survival assessed by colony counting. Results were compared with control suspensions of Candida incubated with serum alone. After 30 and 60 minutes in the presence of autologous serum normal neutrophils had killed significantly more Candida than Crohn's disease neutrophils (mean (SD) 61.0 (16.7)% v 40.5 (16.2)% at 30 minutes, p less than 0.0001; 83.2 (7)% v 70.8) 16)% at 60 minutes, p less than 0.005). The results did not alter significantly when normal neutrophils were incubated with Candida in the presence of Crohn's disease serum instead of normal serum. When Crohn's disease neutrophils were incubated with Candida in the presence of normal serum instead of autologous serum there was some improvement in candidacidal ability at 30 minutes (48.9 (20.6)% v 40.5 (16.2)%, p less than 0.03) but not at 60 minutes. Phagocytosis, measured using a radiometric assay, was normal. Neutrophils from patients with Crohn's disease have an impaired ability to kill this granuloma provoking organism. It is not due to serum inhibitors or defective phagocytosis.\r"

Thirteen patients (including all eight with pouchitis) had subtotal or total villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. In this group, nine had colorectal type sulphomucin and the 40kD colonic protein was detected in two. These changes were not observed in patients with less severe villous abnormalities. Sucrase-isomaltase activity was, however, present in all 25 pouch specimens. We conclude that although some ileal pouches acquire certain colonic characteristics, complete colonic metaplasia does not occur.\r"

Since colonic adenomatous polyps are generally regarded as premalignant lesions, these results lend support to the view that alcohol consumption may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia, thus reinforcing the proposed polyp/carcinoma sequence in colorectal carcinogenesis. The role of smoking, however, is less clear particularly since the lack of association of colorectal carcinoma and smoking has been reported in many other studies.\r"

Unexpectedly, abdominal pain and bloating occurred in most of the control subjects. Pain, however, was six times more frequent in the patients and was more often considered severe. Bloating occurred three times more often. Defecation was more frequent, more erratic in timing and stool form, and more likely to produce stools of extreme forms, indicating rapid fluctuations in intestinal transit time. Urgency was four times more prevalent in patients than control subjects. Straining to finish defecating was nine times more prevalent and was often accompanied by feelings of incomplete evacuation--a combination which could lead to the misdiagnosis of constipation. The normal relation between stool form and the above symptoms was distorted, possibly due to rectal irritability. Non-complainers were intermediate between patients and control subjects in almost every parameter but were closer to control subjects than to patients. Patients with the irritable bowel syndrome have real cause for complaint and their bowel function is truly abnormal.\r"

In the patients there was a reduction in the follicular phase of progesterone (4.5 v 4 nmol/l, p = 0.006, median value, controls v patients), 17 hydroxyprogesterone (9.7 v 5.8 nmol/l, p = 0.01), cortisol (387 v 245 nmol/l, p = 0.008), testosterone (2.3 v 1.8 nmol/l, p less than 0.001), androstenedione (10.3 v 8.4 nmol/l, p = 0.02), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (5.1 v 3.0 mumol/l, p = 0.03).

  ".U": "91122819\r", 
  ".W": "It is now generally accepted that adenosine is capable of regulating a wide range of physiological functions. Nowhere is the diversity of this action better illustrated than in the kidney. When adenosine binds to plasma membrane receptors on a variety of cell types in the kidney, it stimulates functional responses that span the entire spectrum of renal physiology, including alterations in hemodynamics, hormone and neurotransmitter release, and tubular reabsorption. These responses to adenosine appear to represent a means by which the organ and its constituent cell types can regulate their metabolic demand such that it is maintained at an appropriate level for the prevailing metabolic supply. Extracellular adenosine, produced from the hydrolysis of adenosine 5'-monophosphate and stimulated by increased substrate availability and enzyme induction, acts on at least two types of cell surface receptors to stimulate or inhibit the production of cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate and also acts in some renal cells to stimulate the production of inositol phosphates and elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration. To understand when and why this complicated system becomes activated, how it interacts with other known extracellular effector systems, and ultimately how to manipulate the system to therapeutic advantage by selective agonists or antagonists, requires a detailed knowledge of renal adenosine receptors and their signaling mechanisms. The following discussion attempts to highlight our knowledge in this area, to present a modified hypothesis for adenosine as a feedback regulator of renal function, and to identify some important questions regarding the specific cellular mechanisms of adenosine in renal cell types.\r"

The levels of the angiotensin peptides were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay using three specific antibodies that recognized different epitotes in the sequences of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin-(1-7). The analysis revealed that angiotensin-(1-7) is present in the plasma of intact (4.9 +/- 2.2 fmol/ml) and nephrectomized (0.5 +/- 0.5 fmol/ml) dogs. An intravenous injection of purified hog renin (0.01 Goldblatt unit/kg) increased plasma levels of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin-(1-7) both before and after nephrectomy. These changes were associated with parallel increases in the concentrations of fragments of the three parent peptides. Administration of MK-422 led to the disappearance of circulating angiotensin II and its fragments both before and after a second injection of the same dose of renin. In contrast, MK-422 augmented the plasma levels of both angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-7). The concentrations of these two peptides, but not the blood pressure, were again augmented by a second injection of renin given after blockade of converting enzyme. These effects were observed both before and after bilateral nephrectomy. These findings show that angiotensin-(1-7) circulates in the blood of normal and nephrectomized dogs. In addition, we found that angiotensin-(1-7) is generated in the blood from the cleavage of angiotensin I through a pathway independent of converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1).\r"

At 28 weeks of age, average systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg, which was below that of control SHR (188 +/- 3 mm Hg) and WKY rats (124 +/- 3 mm Hg). Body weight and heart rate of the SHR were not affected by the treatment. Tissue level of catecholamines was increased by captopril treatment in the superior cervical ganglia but remained unchanged in the plasma, heart, mesenteric arteries, and the adrenal glands of both SHR and WKY rats. Left ventricular weight, wall thickness, and internal diameter of the left ventricle in the SHR were reduced by the treatment. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that vascular alterations present in the control SHR were prevented by the treatment. In the superior mesenteric artery and large mesenteric artery, smaller lumen size at maximal relaxation found in the control SHR was normalized to the level of the WKY rats. Hypertrophy of the medial wall in the superior mesenteric, large and small mesenteric arteries, and an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large mesenteric artery of the SHR were prevented by the treatment. Perfusion study of the mesenteric vascular bed showed that reactivity of these vessels to norepinephrine was reduced, and sensitivity to norepinephrine (as determined by the effective dose that causes 50% of maximal response) was increased in the SHR by captopril treatment. Sensitivity of the tail artery in response to norepinephrine was not altered by the treatment. We conclude that long-term treatment with captopril of SHR before and after birth prevented the development of hypertension, structural and functional alterations of the mesenteric arteries, and cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "Serotonin, a release product of activated platelets, stimulates proliferation and prostaglandin synthesis in cultured smooth muscle-like glomerular rat mesangial cells by activation of phospholipase and protein kinase C. To further characterize the signaling mechanisms used by serotonin, we monitored its effects on intracellular free Ca2+, pH, and membrane potential of cultured rat mesangial cells with sensitive fluorometric techniques. Activation of a 5-HT2 receptor, blocked by the specific receptor antagonists ketanserin and ritanserin, triggered immediate discharge of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The resulting rise of cytosolic free Ca2+ was accompanied by simultaneous membrane depolarization and followed within 30-60 seconds by prolonged cytosolic alkalinization. Depolarization and cytosolic free Ca2+ elevation were persistent in the continued presence of serotonin and were rapidly reversed by competitive receptor displacement with ketanserin or ritanserin. Depolarization is secondary to enhanced Cl- conductance, whereas it is relatively independent of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ fluxes. The putative Cl- channel is regulated by Ca2+ since ionomycin and other stimuli of cytosolic free Ca2+ mimic the effects of serotonin on membrane potential, whereas serotonin-induced depolarization is blunted in cells pretreated with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. Cytosolic alkalinization occurs in HCO3(-)-free solutions resulting from enhanced activity of a Na(+)-H+ exchanger and blocked by extracellular Na+ removal or amiloride. In the presence of HCO3-, serotonin elicits a persistent acidification, revealing simultaneous enhancement of a Na(+)-independent Cl(-)-HCO3- countertransport. These findings indicate multiple pathways for contraction and long-term functional changes induced by serotonin in mesangial cells, with potential relevance to glomerular and systemic hypertension.\r"

S3 is identical to cytochrome P450 IV A2. SA encoded a protein of 546 amino acid residues, and its carboxyl terminal region had a slight homology to luciferase. No homologous sequence has been reported in S2 sequences. S3 mRNA was about four times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of 28-day-old SHR than in those of age-matched WKY rats, but there was no difference at age 16 weeks. A low NaCl diet positively modulated the expression of the S3 gene. S2 mRNA was almost undetectable in the kidneys of 28-day-old WKY rats but was clearly detected in those of age-matched SHR. The expression level of S2 mRNA in the livers of 16-week-old SHR was about five times higher than that of age-matched WKY rats. The expression of S2 mRNA in the livers was modulated by dietary NaCl and captopril. SA mRNA was more than 10 times more abundantly expressed in the kidneys of SHR than in those of WKY rats from age 4 weeks. With the administration of captopril, the expressions of SA mRNA in the livers of SHR were positively modulated. Because these three genes are not only differentially expressed between SHR and WKY rats but also related to sodium metabolism or blood pressure control, the identification of these genes may provide important probes to examine the mechanisms of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that essential hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance. The tissues responsible for this metabolic alteration have not been defined. We tested the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is the site of insulin resistance of essential hypertension with the use of the perfused forearm technique. Eight hypertensive (age 42 +/- 3 years, body mass index 27 +/- 1 kg/m2, intra-arterial mean blood pressure 126 +/- 4 mm Hg) and seven normotensive (age 48 +/- 3 years, body mass index 26 +/- 1 kg/m2, mean blood pressure 95 +/- 4 mm Hg) male volunteers were studied. After glucose ingestion (40 g/m2), normal glucose tolerance in the patients was maintained at the expense of a heightened plasma insulin response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. During graded, local (intra-arterial) hyperinsulinemia encompassing the physiological range (12-120 milliunits/l), glucose uptake by forearm tissues was significantly (p less than 0.03) reduced in the hypertensive subjects as compared with the controls at each of five insulin steps, by 43% on the average. In addition, forearm lactate and pyruvate release were significantly less stimulated in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (p less than 0.01 for both), presumably as a consequence of the decreased glucose influx. Forearm exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipid substrates (free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate), and potassium were similar in the hypertensive and normotensive groups in the basal state. Insulin had no effect on oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and respiratory quotient in either study group, whereas it stimulated free fatty acids, glycerol, and potassium uptake to the same extent in the hypertensive and normotensive groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of nicotine on the baroreceptor-mediated reflex responses of renal nerve activity (RNA), heart rate, and respiratory activity (minute diaphragmatic activity [MDA]) after bolus injections of phenylephrine was compared in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt sensitive and normotensive rats. Osmotic minipumps that dispensed either nicotine (2.4 mg/kg/day) or saline were implanted in DOCA and normotensive rats for 18 days. Anesthetized DOCA-nicotine, DOCA-saline, control-nicotine, and control-saline rats had mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 117 +/- 3, 110 +/- 9, 90 +/- 3, and 89 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively. Nicotine decreased the sensitivity (p less than 0.05) of baroreceptor reflex control of RNA (% delta RNA/delta MAP) in the DOCA-nicotine rats (-0.92 +/- 0.08) compared with the DOCA-saline (-1.44 +/- 0.16), control-nicotine (-1.45 +/- 0.08), or control-saline (-1.45 +/- 0.21) rats. The reflex decrease in respiratory activity (% delta MDA/delta MAP x 100) was impaired (p less than 0.01) in both control-nicotine (-24.5 +/- 3.3) and DOCA-nicotine (-18.2 +/- 4.6) rats compared with control-saline (-59.2 +/- 9.1) and DOCA-saline (-52.5 +/- 9.9) rats. The reflex decrease in heart rate (absolute delta HR/delta MAP) in both DOCA-nicotine (1.56 +/- 0.17) and control-nicotine (1.54 +/- 0.24) rats was augmented compared with DOCA-saline and control-saline rats (0.91 +/- 0.12 and 0.97 +/- 0.14).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An in vitro bioassay system was developed to study endothelium-mediated, shear stress-induced, or flow-dependent generation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Monolayers of aortic endothelial cells were grown on a rigid and large surface area of microcarrier beads and were packed in a small column perfused with Krebs bicarbonate solution. The perfusate was allowed to superfuse three endothelium-denuded target pulmonary arterial strips arranged in a cascade. Fluid shear stress caused a flow-dependent release of EDRF from the endothelial cells. The action of EDRF was abolished by oxyhemoglobin and methylene blue, and the generation of EDRF in response to shear stress was markedly inhibited or abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine, by NG-amino-L-arginine, by calcium-free extracellular medium, and by depleting endothelial cells of endogenous L-arginine. Addition of L-arginine to arginine-deficient but not arginine-containing endothelial cells rapidly restored the capacity of shear stress and bradykinin to generate EDRF. These observations indicate that fluid shear stress causes the generation of EDRF with properties of nitric oxide from aortic endothelial cells and that the bioassay system described may be useful for studying the mechanism of mechanochemical coupling that leads to nitric oxide generation.\r"

This metabolic abnormality may represent an additional risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we performed the following studies to determine 1) whether hyperuricemia is more prevalent in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and 2) whether allopurinol treatment has a beneficial effect on the development of hypertension in this strain, based on its capacity to lower the serum uric acid concentration and to act as an antioxidant agent. SHR and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were assigned to two groups, one given tap water to drink and the other provided water containing allopurinol (400 mg/l) to furnish an approximate daily dose equal to 100 mg/kg body wt. This treatment was maintained for 15 weeks. The serum uric acid levels were similar in untreated SHR and WKY rats (1.85 +/- 0.10 versus 1.66 +/- 0.14 mg/dl; p = 0.28). In the control WKY rat strain, allopurinol therapy did not adversely affect weight gain or hematocrit and did not cause an increase in mortality. It resulted in a moderate decrement in kidney function (creatinine clearance: allopurinol-treated group 0.32 +/- 0.09 versus control group 0.46 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g body wt, in conjunction with mild-to-moderate tubulointerstitial inflammation (allopurinol-treated group 0.9 +/- 0.4 versus control group 0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hypercholesterolemia frequently accompanies hypertension, and it has been suggested that by affecting membrane lipid composition, hypercholesterolemia may cause or accentuate abnormalities in several red blood cell transports associated with hypertension. Such an effect might obfuscate the relation of membrane markers to hypertension and decrease their usefulness in genetic studies of the heritable basis of hypertension. To determine if changing plasma lipids affects membrane transport, we studied the effects of the cholesterol-lowering agent lovastatin on red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport, red blood cell sodium and water content, and platelet amiloride-sensitive volume responsiveness to cytoplasmic acidification, an indirect measure of sodium-proton exchange that has been proposed as a new membrane marker for hypertension. In a 24-week, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial, lovastatin significantly lowered total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and raised high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Red blood cell lithium-sodium countertransport and sodium-potassium-chloride cotransport were not significantly altered. Red blood cell sodium content decreased significantly in the lovastatin-treated group, probably as a result of an increase in red blood cell sodium-potassium pump activity. Platelet amiloride-sensitive responses to cytoplasmic acidification were significantly depressed by lovastatin treatment, suggesting that lowering plasma cholesterol may suppress platelet sodium-proton exchange. It has been hypothesized that the hyperlipidemias frequently observed in essential hypertensive patients may alter membrane lipid composition and affect membrane cation transport activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management is a multicenter randomized trial designed to examine the diastolic blood pressure response of various combinations of pharmacological and dietary interventions in the treatment of mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-100 mm Hg). Eight hundred and seventy-eight participants at 110-160% of ideal weight were randomly allocated to nine drug/diet treatment groups receiving either a placebo, chlorthalidone (25 mg), or atenolol (50 mg), combined with a usual, a weight loss, or a low sodium/high potassium diet. The primary outcome was diastolic blood pressure change from baseline to 6 months. Seven hundred and eighty-seven participants had follow-up data. The mean baseline diastolic blood pressure was 93.8 mm Hg; 55.9% of the participants were male, and the weight loss diet group lost an average of 4.7 kg. Multiple comparisons were accounted for in the analysis. A significantly greater lowering of diastolic blood pressure (12.4 mm Hg) was achieved in the atenolol group compared with either the low sodium/high potassium diet group (7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.001) or weight loss group (8.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006). Adding weight loss to chlorthalidone significantly enhanced blood pressure lowering (15.1 mm Hg) when compared with the diuretic alone (10.8 mm Hg, p = 0.002), but adding a low sodium/high potassium diet (12.2 mm Hg, p = 0.029) did not. In the short-term treatment of mild hypertension where diastolic blood pressure is the sole consideration, drugs outperform diet, and weight loss is beneficial, especially with diuretics.\r"

After adjustment for neonatal breast versus formula feeding, maternal prenatal calcium intake was inversely related to systolic blood pressure at 1 month (r = -0.21, p less than 0.01), and to diastolic blood pressure at 6 months (r = -0.27, p less than 0.01) and 12 months (r = -0.24, p less than 0.05). Maternal prenatal magnesium intake was inversely related to 6-month systolic blood pressure (r = -0.20, p less than 0.05). In multivariable models with all three cations, maternal prenatal potassium intake was independently and inversely related to diastolic blood pressure at 6 and 12 months. Maternal prenatal calcium intake was independently related to 1-month systolic and 6-month diastolic blood pressure.

We have previously shown that the wideband external pulse recorded during cuff deflation can be separated into three components (K1, K2, and K3), one of which (K2) is closely related to the Korotkoff sound. G1 occurs with cuff pressure just below systolic and is characterized by the presence of K1 and K2 with intermittent disappearance of K2. G1 gaps are related to a phasic decrease of arterial (systolic) pressure and were exhibited by 13 of 60 hypertensive patients. G2 gaps are related to a phasic increase of arterial (diastolic) pressure, occur when cuff pressure is just above diastolic, and are characterized by the presence of K1, K2, and K3 with intermittent disappearance of K2. Seven of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G2 gap. G3 gaps occur with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic and are characterized by an underdeveloped or blunted K2 signal. Three of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G3 gap. The identification of auscultatory gaps in relation to the wideband external pulse provides a qualitative measure of their existence, can be of significant value in better understanding aspects of the auscultatory blood pressure measurement technique, and provides an objective basis with which to better understand the mechanisms that cause them.\r"
