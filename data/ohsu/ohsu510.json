Follicular fluid LH, FSH, PRL, estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), androstenedione (A), and testosterone (T) concentrations and P/E2 and A/E2 ratios were determined. Oocytes were classified as germinal vesicle (gv), metaphase I (mI), metaphase II (mII), or degenerating (dg). Follicular fluid (ff) hormone levels then were correlated with the stage of oocyte maturation. There were no differences in ff E1 or E2 levels at any stage of oocyte maturation, except that the mean ff E2 concentration was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in ff containing dg oocytes [2,474 +/- 1,435 (+/- SE) nmol/L] than in those containing the other oocyte stages. The mean P levels were significantly (P less than 0.0001) higher in ff containing mI (48,781 +/- 10,240 nmol/L) and mII (41,801 +/- 11,098 nmol/L) oocytes than in ff containing gv oocytes (1371 +/- 696 nmol/L). The mean A level was highest (P less than 0.01) in dg-associated ff. Similarly, T was highest (P less than 0.05) in ff containing dg (52 +/- 14 nmol/L) oocytes than in ff containing mI (10.7 +/- 10.1 nmol/L) or mII (10.1 +/- 4 nmol/L) oocytes, and it was also elevated (P less than 0.05) in gv ff (72 +/- 33 nmol/L) compared to mII ff. The above differences also were reflected in the P/E2 ratio, which was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in mI and mII ff, as well as in the A/E2 ratio, which was higher (P less than 0.05) in ff containing mI and mII oocytes compared to ff containing gv or dg oocytes. These data define the evolving changes in the microenvironment of the follicular fluid of preovulatory follicles of normally cycling women. They also provide reference points for analysis of ff obtained from women during stimulated cycles intended for in vitro fertilization.\r"

  ".W": "Serum inhibin levels rise markedly during the luteal phase of the human menstrual cycle and are closely correlated with serum progesterone (P) levels, suggesting that the corpus luteum (CL) secretes inhibin. While FSH is the major regulator of inhibin secretion by the granulosa cells, the control of CL inhibin secretion is unclear. We hypothesized that, like P, CL inhibin secretion would be LH dependent. To examine this possibility, normal women were given the GnRH antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1, D4CL Phe2, D3Pal3, Arg5, DGlu6 (AA), DAla10]GnRH (Nal-Glu antagonist) for 3 consecutive days commencing on day 6-8 of the luteal phase. The daily doses were 2.5 (n = 3), 10 (n = 4), and 25 micrograms/kg (n = 5), sc. Serum LH levels fell 2 h after injection, and the fall was maximal (70-74%) at 6 h; the degree of suppression was not dose dependent. The duration of suppression was dose related, being less than 12 h, between 12, and 24 h, and more than 24 h for the 2.5, 10, and 25 micrograms/kg doses, respectively. Serum FSH levels declined by 22-43%, but the effect was not dose related. Serum P levels fell by 42-45% 8 h after each dose of antagonist. They returned to baseline 24 h after the 2.5 micrograms/kg dose, but after both the 10 and 25 micrograms/kg doses serum P levels continued to fall, and menstrual bleeding commenced within 48-72 h after the first antagonist injection. Serum inhibin levels were not altered relative to normal cycles by the 2.5 micrograms/kg dose, but fell by 48% and 58%, and 62% and 73% respectively, 48 and 72 h after the 10 and 25 micrograms/kg doses, respectively. Serum P and inhibin levels correlated closely in all women. To examine the relative roles of FSH and LH in the control of CL function, Nal-Glu antagonist (25 micrograms/kg, sc) was administered at 0 and 24 h commencing on day 6-8 of the luteal phase, in combination with either human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; 150 IU, im, every 12 h) or hCG (1500 IU, im, once), both commencing at 0 h. hMG administration led to a rapid (by 2 h) and marked (3- to 9-fold) rise in serum FSH levels, whereas serum LH remained low, similar to antagonist alone treatment cycless.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Blood samples were obtained hourly for 24 h, and serum TSH was measured using an immunoradiometric assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 mU/L and an intraassay coefficient of variation of 4.9%. The nadir serum TSH value, defined by the three consecutive hourly TSH concentrations having the lowest mean, occurred between 1000 and 1900 h, while the peak TSH value, defined by the three consecutive hourly TSH concentrations having the greatest mean, occurred between 2100 and 0600 h. The mean nadir serum TSH was 1.6 +/- 0.1 mU/L, and the mean peak TSH was 3.7 +/- 0.2 mU/L. The mean nocturnal TSH surge (percent increase in TSH from nadir to peak) was 144% (95% confidence limits, 50-300%) and did not correlate with serum T4, free T4, or T3 concentrations. Seventy-six children were given TRH (7 micrograms/kg). The mean peak serum TSH after TRH was 16.0 +/- 1.1 mU/L (95% confidence limits, 9.0-42.0 mU/L), and it occurred by 30 min after TRH administration in 92% of the children. The absolute peak nocturnal serum TSH and peak post-TRH serum TSH values correlated significantly (r = 0.62; P less than 0.001), while age, gender, and pubertal status did not correlate with either the nocturnal TSH surge or the TSH response to TRH. We conclude that normal children have a circadian variation of serum TSH characterized by a nocturnal TSH surge, and that the peak of serum TSH, which occurs at night, correlates with the peak serum TSH level after TRH administration.\r"

  ".U": "89255822\r", 
  ".W": "We previously reported that GH secretion evoked by GHRH is inhibited after 5 days of treatment with im GH. This impaired pituitary response was associated with a significant increase in the serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). To dissociate the possible effects of circulating IGF-I from other effects of GH on the pituitary response to GHRH, we carried out the following study in eight normal men. A bolus injection of GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) was administered 2 h after the start of a 4-h continuous iv infusion of GH (180-micrograms bolus dose, then 3 micrograms/min in 150 mmol/L NaCl) or placebo (150 mmol/L NaCl). In addition, a similar injection of GHRH was given 4 h after the start of a 6-h continuous iv GH infusion (180-micrograms bolus dose, then 3 micrograms/min). During the GH infusions, plasma GH levels reached steady state concentrations in the 9-13 micrograms/L range. The mean GHRH-induced GH response was not significantly blunted during the 4-h infusions of GH [724 +/- 163 (+/- SE) vs. 1184 +/- 373 micrograms.min/L during placebo; P = 0.29], but was significantly inhibited during the 6-h GH infusions (226 +/- 105 micrograms.min/L; P = 0.04 vs. control). Serum IGF-I or plasma glucose did not change significantly throughout the GH infusions. During the 6-h GH infusions, plasma FFA increased to levels significantly above basal values during the last 3 h of the 6-h infusion. These results indicate that short term GH infusion inhibits the plasma GH response to GHRH in a time-dependent manner. The inhibition is not due to changes in circulating IGF-I and glucose concentrations. Fluctuations in hypothalamic somatostatin secretion, changes in lipid or other GH-dependent metabolites, paracrine effects of IGF-I, or a direct effect of GH itself may cause the impaired pituitary responsiveness during short term iv GH infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Persistent suppression of gonadotropin and ovarian steroid production can be achieved in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) by daily administration of a long-acting GnRH agonist (GnRHa). This study was designed to determine the patterns of recovery of clinical responses and hormonal secretion after chronic GnRHa administration in women with PCO. Six women with PCO were treated with daily sc injections of [D-His6(imBzl),Pro9-NEt]GnRHa (100 micrograms) for 6 months. Blood samples were obtained at the time of and three times weakly for 90 days after discontinuation of agonist therapy. In five women who did not ovulate, the suppressed serum FSH levels rose to pretreatment values within 10 days. In contrast, a gradual and progressive increase in serum LH (as measured by bioassay and immunoassay) was apparent by day 18. The LH increase coincided with progressive increases in serum estrone (E1), androstenedione, and testosterone. Serum estradiol (E2) began to rise on day 28. All hormones returned to their pretreatment baseline values within the 90-day recovery interval, with the exception of E2. Trend analysis of the slopes of recovery revealed that the incremental secretion patterns of E1, E2, androstenedione, and testosterone differed significantly from that of FSH, but not from those of bioactive or immunoactive LH. Serum progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and cortisol did not change after withdrawal of GnRHa. One woman ovulated spontaneously on day 52 before which her hormone secretion patterns were indistinguishable from those of the other women. In summary, 1) during recovery after discontinuation of chronic GnRH agonist therapy the patterns of FSH and LH release suggested resumption of endogenous GnRH action on the pituitary with greater release of FSH than LH, a pattern that would be expected in the absence of ovarian steroid influence; 2) the lack of early estrogen production despite the increase in serum FSH concentrations suggests inadequate FSH secretion, abnormal ovarian responsiveness to FSH, or impaired FSH bioactivity; 3) androgen secretion was provoked by the increase in LH secretion; 4) per unit LH measured by bioassay, greater ovarian androgen secretion was stimulated in PCO than ovulatory women; and 5) the likelihood of spontaneous ovulation during recovery was minimal.\r"

  ".W": "We studied in vivo hormone levels and in vitro hormone and subunit release in a group of 22 patients who were operated upon because of a clinically nonfunctioning or gonadotroph pituitary adenoma. In vivo, 5 of the 22 patients, all men, had hypersecretion of FSH, LH beta, or alpha-subunit. An elevated ratio of serum alpha-subunit to LH and FSH was found in 6 of 8 women in vivo, although in all 6 women serum LH, FSH, and alpha-subunit levels were low. LH, FSH, alpha-subunit, LH beta, or a combination of these glycoprotein hormones could be demonstrated in 19 of 22 cultured adenomas. We conclude that 1) virtually all clinically nonfunctioning adenomas contain or release gonadotropins or their subunits in vitro; 2) in vivo hypersecretion of these hormones and subunits occurs infrequently, and in this series only in men; 3) an elevated ratio of alpha-subunit to LH and FSH is frequently found in women and may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool; 4) responses to TRH and bromocriptine do not depend on baseline gonadotropin levels, either in vitro or in vivo, implying that the distinction between gonadotroph adenomas and adenomas without hypersecretion of gonadotropins in vivo is absent where hormone dynamics are concerned.\r"

  ".U": "89255829\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the effect of 26 drugs on T4 binding to transthyretin (TTR; prealbumin) and T4-binding globulin (TBG) by determining their ability to inhibit [125I]T4 binding to TTR isolated from normal human plasma and to serum diluted 1:10,000, respectively. The hierarchies for drug inhibition of T4 binding differed greatly for these two proteins. Relative to T4, the drugs were much more potent inhibitors of [125I]T4 binding to TTR than to TBG. Compounds of the anthranilic acid class, such as flufenamic, meclofenamic, and mefenamic acids, interacted particularly strongly with TTR. Flufenamic acid was more potent than T4 itself in inhibiting [125I]T4 binding [175 +/- 17% (+/- SD); cf. T4; n = 3; P less than 0.001], while mefenamic acid, diflunisal, and meclofenamic acid were 20-26% as potent as T4 in their interaction with TTR. The reactivity of diclofenac, fenclofenac, indomethacin, sulindac, and the diuretic ethacrynic acid was 0.8-2.1% relative to that of T4. In contrast, furosemide, the drug most highly reactive with TBG, was only 0.11 +/- 0.03% (n = 7) as potent as T4, followed by meclofenamic acid greater than mefenamic acid greater than fenclofenac greater than flufenamic acid greater than diflunisal greater than milrinone. Aspirin and sodium salicylate were, respectively, 0.05% and 0.20% as active as unlabeled T4 as inhibitors of [125I]T4 binding to TTR, but these compounds had only 3-4 x 10(-6)% of the activity of T4 for TBG binding. Diphenylhydantoin had no detectable effect on T4 binding to TTR and was 2.9 x 10(-4)% as reactive as T4 with TBG. Amiodarone did not interact with either binding site. Drug interactions with TTR may be important when this protein becomes a major circulating T4-binding protein, as in patients with complete or partial TBG deficiency, or when serum T4 is markedly elevated. Such interactions may also be important where TTR is the dominant tissue T4-binding protein, as in the choroid plexus. In addition, the drug competitors described here may be useful as probes to further define the structural basis for specific ligand interactions with different classes of T4-binding sites.\r"

We studied GH and PRL secretory dynamics in three patients with McCune-Albright syndrome and hypersecretion of these hormones. Each patient had excessive linear growth, glucose-non-suppressible plasma GH concentration, and GH responsiveness to TRH and GHRH. In response to exogenous GHRH, plasma GH concentrations rose approximately 2-fold in all three patients. Plasma GHRH levels were 20-40 ng/L (normal, less than 30). Study of the spontaneous GH secretory pattern in two patients indicated nocturnal augmentation of GH release. Bromocriptine therapy failed to reduce plasma GH in all patients; in one patient treatment with octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analog, partially suppressed plasma GH and insulin-like growth factor I levels. These results suggest that hypersecretion of GH in the McCune-Albright syndrome is not due to ectopic GHRH production or autonomous somatotroph function. The results are similar to those described in classic acromegaly due to GH-secreting pituitary tumors. However, the lack of radiographic pituitary enlargement, the variable pituitary pathology reported in similar patients, and frequent concordance of GH and PRL excess suggest that the pathogenesis of this disorder may differ fundamentally from other forms of acromegaly or gigantism. The pathophysiology may reflect abnormal hypothalamic regulation and/or an embryological defect in pituitary cellular differentiation and function.\r"

Plasma SRIH concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.02) higher in the luteal phase of spontaneous menstrual cycles than in follicular phase and midcycle. Serum GH levels, however, did not change. Plasma motilin concentrations also were higher in the luteal phase than at mid-cycle (P less than 0.04). Plasma secretin, VIP, and pancreatic polypeptide concentrations did not change during the cycle. Throughout the spontaneous menstrual cycle we found significant positive correlations between plasma SRIH and serum progesterone (P less than 0.007; r = 0.5869), plasma motilin and serum progesterone (P less than 0.02; r = 0.5331), plasma secretin and serum estradiol (P less than 0.04; r = 0.4711), and plasma secretin and serum PRL (P less than 0.02; r = 0.5507). During ovarian stimulation both plasma secretin and VIP gradually increased to a peak on cycle days 0 and 1, respectively (day 0 = the day of hCG injection), whereas plasma SRIH did not change. Serum estradiol and PRL increased significantly, and both peaked on cycle day 1. During ovarian stimulation plasma secretin correlated significantly with serum estradiol (P less than 0.00001; r = 0.9333), serum PRL (P less than 0.03; r = 0.6521), and plasma VIP (P less than 0.03; r = 0.6534). In addition, plasma VIP and serum PRL both correlated significantly with serum estradiol (P less than 0.05; r = 0.6024 and P less than 0.04; r = 0.6384, respectively). These results indicate 1) a possible effect of progesterone on the release of SRIH and motilin during the spontaneous menstrual cycle; 2) the unaltered serum GH concentrations in the luteal phase of the spontaneous menstrual cycle despite elevated plasma SRIH levels are probably due to a stimulatory effect of both progesterone and motilin on GH release; and 3) the increase in plasma secretin and VIP concentrations during ovarian stimulation is probably secondary to the concomitant increase in serum estradiol and/or PRL. We suggest that estradiol and/or PRL beyond a certain threshold level stimulate the release of secretin, and possibly also VIP, into plasma.\r"

Serum and urinary buserelin concentrations were determined by specific RIA (buserelin antiserum AS-639). Intact buserelin and the metabolites in urine were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and measured by RIA. The mean serum buserelin concentrations were 101 +/- 33 (+/- SD) ng/mL 20 min and 1.12 +/- 0.12 ng/mL 360 min after its iv injection in 6 women, and the mean elimination half-life between 20 and 360 min was 51 min. In serum, intact buserelin was the main constituent (10 min, 90%; 120 min, 74%; 360 min, 52%), and the major metabolite was the buserelin-(5-9) pentapeptide (10 min, 0.6%; 120 min, 19%; 360 min, 12%). In the urine collected 0-1 h after buserelin administration, intact buserelin was 66% and the 5-9 pentapeptide was 28% of the total excretion. In the urine collected between 6-24 h after buserelin administration, intact buserelin accounted for 67% and the 5-9 pentapeptide for 32% of the total excretion. The urinary buserelin concentration was 1345 +/- 156 micrograms/g creatinine 1 h and 25 +/- 5 micrograms/g creatinine 6-24 h after buserelin administration. Serum LH, FSH, and estradiol concentrations increased acutely up to 10-fold above basal values; the mean peak LH, FSH, and estradiol values occurred at 180-240 min, 240 min, and 24 h, respectively. In therapeutic studies with buserelin nasal spray in 5 women, serum concentrations of 0.9-1.4 ng/mL were found 15 min after a single dose of 300 micrograms, intranasally, and the urinary excretion was 2.52-3.68 micrograms/24 h during daily administration of 3 doses of 300 micrograms at intervals of 8 h. These results confirm that buserelin is slowly inactivated and remains available to pituitary receptors for a prolonged period after its iv or intranasal administration.\r"

  ".W": "A 32-yr-old man with a history of hypospadias, unilateral cryptorchidism, and pubertal gynecomastia (all surgically corrected) presented with complaints of infertility. Examination revealed scant virilization, recurrence of gynecomastia, small but normal sized testes, small prostate, and oligospermia. His plasma LH, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol levels were high, and his plasma FSH was below the reference range of adult men. An assay of pubic skin fibroblast androgen receptors confirmed the diagnosis of a form of incomplete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Administration of the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen (10 mg, twice daily) induced an increase in plasma FSH greater than that which occurred in six men with idiopathic oligospermia. This man's wife conceived three times during a period of 5 yr, each time after he had received tamoxifen for 12-20 weeks and had considerable improvement of sperm parameters. Conversely, upon cessation of tamoxifen therapy, the semen abnormalities returned. These results indicate that estrogen action impaired this man's fertility, and the impairment could be reversed by administration of an estrogen receptor antagonist.\r"

Compared with PBMC, freshly isolated intestinal mononuclear cells expressed significantly more cell surface activation antigens on both B and T lymphocytes. Intestinal mononuclear cells contained significant numbers of immunoglobulin secreting cells immediately after cell separation. This population included CD5-positive B cells that secreted predominantly IgA. Cells from the large bowel consistently revealed higher numbers of IgA secreting cells than cells from the small bowel. Thus, intestinal B cells are markedly activated in vivo compared with PBMC and this increased activation correlates with increased spontaneous antibody secretion. B cells from the large intestine are more highly activated and secrete more antibody than do cells from the small intestine. The intestinal lamina propria lymphoid compartment exhibits a heightened state of activation that may be important for its distinct role in mucosal defense.\r"

The nature of the leishmanial antigens involved in eliciting T cell immunity is unknown. We have examined the pattern of peripheral blood lymphocyte responses in patients with active, healed, or subclinical leishmanial infection to fractionated leishmanial antigens using a T cell immunoblotting method in which nitrocellulose-bound leishmanial antigen, resolved by one or two dimensional electrophoresis, are incorporated into lymphocyte cultures. The proliferative and IFN-gamma responses of cells from patients with healed mucosal or cutaneous leishmaniasis were remarkably heterogeneous and occurred to as many as 50-70 distinct antigens. In contrast, responses from subjects with active, nonhealing, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis were either absent or present to only a small number of antigens. Control and resolution of leishmaniasis, and resistance to reinfection, is therefore associated with a T cell response to a large and diverse pool of parasite antigens. The method of T cell immunoblotting appears to offer a powerful, rapid, and relatively simple approach to the identification of antigens involved in eliciting a T cell response in human leishmaniasis.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids inhibit superoxide (O2-) generation by phagocytes through a mechanism that remains unclear. We investigated this effect by using dexamethasone on guinea pig alveolar macrophages. O2- generation was induced either by the calcium ionophore A23187, a potent stimulus of phospholipase A2, or by the protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Dexamethasone inhibited O2- generation initiated by A23187 by 50-55%. This inhibition required: (a) more than 45 min incubation and was maximal after 2 h; (b) glucocorticoid receptor occupancy; and (c) protein synthesis. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone could not be explained by an interaction with the respiratory burst enzyme NADPH oxidase since O2- generation was only weakly affected upon PMA stimulation. Lipocortin I, a glucocorticoid inducible and phospholipase A2 inhibitory protein, inhibited O2- generation initiated by A23187 but failed to modulate the respiratory burst activated by PMA. These results were obtained with lipocortin I purified from mouse lungs, human blood mononuclear cells, and with human recombinant lipocortin I. We propose that lipocortin I is capable of inhibiting the activation of NADPH oxidase only when membrane signal transduction involves phospholipase A2. By mimicking the effect of dexamethasone, lipocortin I may extend its potential anti-inflammatory action to the partial control of the formation of oxygen reactive species by phagocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium/calmodulin is involved in the regulation of basal rabbit ileal active Na and Cl absorption, but the mechanism by which elevated intracellular Ca2+ affects Na and Cl transport is unknown. To investigate the roles of the Ca2+/calmodulin and protein kinase C systems in ileal NaCl transport, two drugs, the isoquinolenesulfonamide, H-7, and the naphthalenesulfonamide, W13, were used in concentrations that conferred specificity in the antagonism of protein kinase C (60 microM H-7) and Ca2+/calmodulin (45 microM W13), respectively, as determined using phosphorylation assays in ileal villus cells. W13 but not H-7 stimulated basal active NaCl absorption. H-7 inhibited changes in Na and Cl absorption caused by maximal concentrations of Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and carbachol and serotonin, secretagogues that act by increasing cytosol Ca2+, while W13 had no effect. In contrast, neither H-7 nor W13 altered the change in NaCl transport caused by the cyclic nucleotides 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP. These data suggest that: (a) basal rabbit ileal NaCl absorption is regulated by the Ca2+/calmodulin complex and not by protein kinase C; (b) the effect of elevating intracellular Ca2+ to decrease NaCl absorption is mediated via protein kinase C but not by Ca2+/calmodulin; (c) the effects of protein kinase C are not overlapping or synergistic with those of Ca2+/calmodulin on either basal absorption or on the effects of increased Ca2+; and (d) neither Ca2+/calmodulin nor protein kinase C are involved in the effects of cAMP and cGMP on ileal active NaCl transport.\r"

The mechanism by which these antibodies, usually designated \"factor VIII inhibitors,\" interfere with factor VIII function has been examined by determining their effect on factor VIII binding to a phospholipid. Factor VIII-phosphatidylserine binding was prevented by all seven factor VIII inhibitors that had strong factor VIII light chain reactivity and reduced by two inhibitors with weak anti-light chain reactivity. None of four inhibitors with heavy chain reactivity prevented factor VIII-phosphatidylserine interaction, though a partial reduction (less than 50%) was noted for the intact IgG preparations. However, when Fab' fragments were substituted, no detectable reduction in factor VIII-phosphatidylserine binding was noted for the anti-heavy chain inhibitors and complete inhibition was retained by the anti-light chain inhibitors. These data suggest that a subset of factor VIII inhibitors, those that bind to light chain determinants, inactivate factor VIII by preventing its effective interaction with phospholipid.\r"

Similarly, the activity of pp60c-src from 13 of 21 primary colon carcinomas was five- or sevenfold higher than that of pp60c-src from normal colonic mucosa adjacent to the tumor. The increased pp60c-src activity did not result solely from an increase in the level of pp60c-src protein, suggesting the specific activity of the pp60c-src kinase is elevated in the tumor cells. pp60c-src from colon carcinoma cells and normal colonic mucosal cells was phosphorylated at similar sites. We used immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine to identify substrates of protein-tyrosine kinases in colonic cells. Three phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were detected at significantly higher levels in most colon carcinoma cell lines than in normal colonic mucosal cells or human or rat fibroblasts. All colon carcinoma cell lines with elevated pp60c-src in vitro kinase activity, showed increased phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine in vivo, suggesting the presence of an activated protein-tyrosine kinase(s).\r"

No change in the alpha-subunit of Gi (alpha i) was observed in STZ or BB/Wor rats using pertussis toxin-stimulated [32P]ADP-ribosylation. Immunodetection using antibodies against the COOH-terminal decapeptides of alpha T and alpha i-3 showed no change in alpha i in STZ rats and a slight decrease in BB/Wor rats. Angiotensin II inhibition of hepatic adenylate cyclase was not altered in either diabetic rat.

D-Mannitol and inulin are totally and rapidly excreted, once they have penetrated through the skin into the blood stream, permitting direct in vivo monitoring. For evaluating skin penetration of physostigmine the decrease of whole blood cholinesterase was measured. Ultrasound nearly completely eliminated the lag time usually associated with transdermal delivery of drugs. 3-5 min of ultrasound irradiation (1.5 W/cm2 continuous wave or 3 W/cm2 pulsed wave) increased the transdermal permeation of inulin and mannitol in rats by 5-20-fold within 1-2 h following ultrasound application. Ultrasound treatment also significantly increased (P less than 0.05) the inhibition of cholinesterase during the first hour after application in both physostigmine treated rats and guinea pigs: while in control guinea pigs no significant inhibition of cholinesterase could be detected during the first 2 h after application of physostigmine, the ultrasound treated group showed a 15 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM) decrease in blood cholinesterase 1 h after ultrasound application. For physostigmine-treated rats the level of cholinesterase inhibition 1 h after ultrasound application was 53 +/- 5% in the ultrasound-treated group and 35 +/- 5% in the controls.\r"

Global and regional ejection fraction values were significantly better for patients treated with rt-PA than for placebo-treated patients (the differences were 5.8 +/- 2.7% units [p = 0.017] and 7.1 +/- 3.1% units [p = 0.012], respectively). This benefit was also evident from visual assessment of left ventricular segmental wall motion.

Early patency of the infarct-related vessel was demonstrable in 7 (29%) of 24 placebo-treated patients and 18 (78%) of 23 rt-PA-treated patients, whereas 15 (56%) of 27 patients in the placebo group and 23 (72%) of 32 in the rt-PA group had a patent infarct-related vessel at hospital day 9.

Plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide were measured in 102 patients in whom left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording and plasma levels of norepinephrine, renin activity, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin were also measured. Compared with patients with atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations below the median value of 125 pg/ml, patients with higher levels of the peptide had a higher plasma renin activity (8.9 +/- 1.8 versus 2.6 +/- 0.4 ng/ml per h) and plasma norepinephrine (858 +/- 116 versus 538 +/- 45 pg/ml), more frequent premature ventricular depolarizations (4,485 +/- 715 versus 2,004 +/- 495/day) and more advanced hemodynamic abnormalities (all p less than 0.05). During the subsequent 13 to 25 months of follow-up, patients with high levels of atrial natriuretic peptide had a significantly lower rate of survival than did those whose initial circulating peptide concentrations were normal or mildly increased (p = 0.01). These data indicate that, in patients with chronic heart failure, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide provides important prognostic information. This may relate to the ability of the hormone to reflect the interplay of several pathophysiologic factors that contribute to mortality in this disease.\r"

The formulary system involved a stepwise process: determination of categories of products to be considered and criteria for product selection, identification of enteral needs of patients at nutritional risk within the institution, review of current literature on formulation of all major enteral products, and taste evaluation of products to be used orally. Composition of the formulary was then determined, and interdepartmental efforts for implementation were coordinated. The overall department impact included a 37% reduction in variety of products stocked, the creation of an annual update system, and extensive dietitian education on product formulation and usage. The direct impact on patient care was the provision of a formulary specifically targeted to meet the enteral needs of those patients at nutritional risk within the institution.\r"

That conclusion was supported by our own findings in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition and following the transition to oral or enteral feedings. Although concentrations of these plasma proteins have been shown to be affected by stress and renal and hepatic disease, they appear to be more sensitive indicators of the adequacy of nutrition support than other more commonly used assessment parameters.\r"

  ".U": "89256656\r", 
  ".W": "Within the thymus, developing T cells must acquire the competence to respond to appropriate signals by inducing the expression of genes required for immunologic function; one such gene encodes the 55-kDa-chain of the IL-2R (IL-2R alpha). Previously, we showed that most cortical-type thymocytes lack the competence to make this particular response, while most medullary-type cells respond like mature T lymphocytes. The noninducibility of cortical-type cells was striking, because most of their presumed precursors were inducible. To test the relationship between this apparent loss of competence and the positive and negative selection processes that may occur in the thymic cortex, we have assayed the inducibility of thymocyte populations, staged carefully with respect to their expression of TCR. Using size fractionation to enrich for dividing cells, we concentrated and thereby revealed defined developmental intermediates. We report that, although CD4+CD8- thymocytes behave as mature T cells, a significant fraction of CD4-CD8+ cells are noninducible. These noninducible thymocytes are dividing cells, which appear to be in a major developmental continuum between CD4-CD8- blasts and CD4+CD8+ blasts. Furthermore, the noninducible blasts as yet lack surface TCR expression. We also demonstrate the functional similarity of these CD4-CD8+ cells to a major subset of dividing CD4-CD8- precursor cells, which appear to have lost IL-2R alpha expression. These results suggest that precursors of cortical thymocytes lose competence to be induced to express IL-2R alpha several stages before their acquisition of cell-surface TCR complexes. The implications of this characterization are discussed in terms of the possible relationships between IL-2R alpha gene regulation and intrathymic fate determination.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of type I IFN inducers and rIFN-alpha on MHC expression in mouse tissues in vivo. MHC expression was assessed in a radiolabeled mAb binding assay and by indirect immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections. polyI:C, an inducer of IFN-alpha/beta, induced large increases in class I MHC in many tissues, with little effect on class II expression. In the kidney, which was studied in detail, polyI:C increased class I expression from day 1 to day 6, localized in glomeruli, tubules, and arterial endothelium. Renal class II MHC was less affected but tended to be decreased at days 3 to 6, corresponding to diminished staining of class II-positive interstitial cells. polyI:C increased renal class I MHC in nude mice and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, and in mice treated with cyclosporine or mAb against IFN-gamma. The effects of influenza virus resembled those of polyI:C. However, a potent T cell stimulus, allogeneic ascites tumor cells, induced markedly different MHC changes, with massive and sustained increases in class I and II, presumably due to IFN-gamma release, which was inhibited by cyclosporine or by mAb against IFN-gamma. The effect of polyI:C was largely simulated by rIFN-alpha, whereas the effect of allogeneic cells was simulated by rIFN-gamma. Thus, rIFN-alpha and its inducers in vivo produce a sustained increase in renal class I expression in kidney and other tissues, sometimes with changes in class II expression. Such effects could be relevant to the immune modulatory actions of IFN, and to the immunologic consequences of viral infections.\r"

  ".W": "Primary Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands, producing associated dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dry mouth, and intermittently swollen salivary glands. A high proportion of the infiltrating B lymphocytes express surface and cytoplasmic Ig bearing a kappa-L chain-associated CRI defined by reactivity with the murine mAb, 17.109. To determine the structural basis for CRI expression in this disease, we generated CRI+ lymphoblastoid cell lines and a cDNA library from lymphocytes extracted from Sjogren's syndrome patients' salivary gland biopsy specimens. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the mRNA of one such 17.109-CRI+ lymphoblastoid cell line (NOV) reveals the expressed kappa light chain variable region gene (V kappa gene) to be homologous to Humkv325, a conserved V kappa gene used at relatively high frequency in certain B cell malignancies. In addition, synthetic oligonucleotides, corresponding to the first and third frameworks and the second complementarity determining region of the Humkv325 gene, were used to identify and isolate clones from a cDNA library generated from SS salivary gland lymphocytes. Clones annealing specifically with one or more of these oligonucleotide probes contained kappa light chain cDNA. The sequences corresponding to the variable region of two clones (Taykv320 and Taykv306) were homologous to Humkv325. The V kappa genes of four other cDNA clones (Taykv322, Taykv310, Taykv308, and Taykv312) most likely were generated somatically from the rearranged Humkv325 gene through a limited number of nucleic acid base substitutions. Our results suggest that the high frequency of 17.109-CRI expression in Sjogren's syndrome patients results from a multiclonal expansion of B cells using Humkv325, and that the expressed Humkv325 may undergo somatic diversification in an apparent Ag-driven response.\r"

Pertussis toxin (PT) markedly inhibited all three IL-1-induced activation events. The inhibition by PT was associated with a decrease in IL-1-mediated cAMP production. PT also inhibited IL-1-stimulated cAMP production in crude membrane fractions from 7OZ/3, YT, and 3T3 fibroblasts. In addition, IL-1 stimulated GTPase activity present in the membranes IL-1-responsive cells. Furthermore, the IL-1-induced GTPase activity was sensitive to PT. PT induced the ADP-ribosylation of a 46-kDa substrate in membrane preparations from IL-1-responsive cells. Cholera toxin also induced the ADP-ribosylation of a 46-kDa substrate in the same membrane preparations. The present findings indicate that the IL-1R is linked to a PT-sensitive G protein that stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Rat macrophages express a binding structure for sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates (sialic acid-binding receptor, SAR) which can be detected by a rosette assay utilizing SRBC coated with bovine brain gangliosides (E-G). Freshly isolated rat bone marrow cells (BMC) contain about 5% SAR-positive cells. Rat BMC cultured for 1 wk with tissue culture media containing CSF-1 differentiate into a virtually pure population of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM phi). All BMDM phi bound E-G coated with an optimal concentration of gangliosides (100 micrograms/ml). When BMC were cultured for 1 wk with murine recombinant granulocyte-macrophage CSF, irrespective of the dose of GM-CSF, approximately 90% of the cells were identified as rat macrophages, and practically all expressed SAR. Only about 50% of BMDM phi bound SRBC coated with a suboptimal concentration of gangliosides (20 micrograms/ml). However, this percentage increased markedly after 8 to 72 h incubation with 1 to 10,000 U/ml purified murine IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, whereas murine or rat rIFN-gamma at doses above 10 U/ml led to a decrease of E-G binding. Human and murine rTNF-alpha enhanced rosette formation in a dose-dependent manner. These effects could be blocked by the respective anti-cytokine antibodies. Treatment of BMDM phi with dexamethasone also augmented E-G rosetting. The enhancement of E-G binding was abolished by pretreatment of BMDM phi with cycloheximide and actinomycin D but not with mitomycin C, suggesting that de novo synthesis of protein and RNA, but not DNA, is required. Our results demonstrate that all rat BMDM phi constitutively bear SAR, and that murine IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and TNF-alpha, as well as dexamethasone, may augment SAR expression.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have shown that rat oligodendrocytes release phospholipid and generate arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene B4 in response to sublytic C5b-9 formation. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical pathways by which C5b-9 generates AA from clone ROC-1, a fusion product of rat oligodendrocytes and C6 glioma. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of [3H]AA or [3H]myoinositol. They were then sensitized with antibody against hybrid cell stroma and treated for 1 h with C9-depleted human serum (C9D-HS) or C9D-HS reconstituted with C9. Alternatively, cells were treated with C8,C9D-HS or C8,C9D-HS reconstituted with C8 or C8 plus C9 for 1 h. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the released [3H]AA and [3H]myoinositol radiolabeled products were performed by thin layer chromatography/autoradiography and anion exchange chromatography, respectively. The major [3H]AA radiolabeled products after C5b-9 stimulation comigrated with intact phospholipid and AA standards, and the major [3H]myoinositol radiolabeled product was inositol-1-phosphate. Treatment of cells with phospholipase A2 inhibitors, mepacrine and bromophenacyl bromide, abolished AA release by C5b-9. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, C5b-9 also failed to induce the release of AA. Interestingly, 1-(5-isoquinolinsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), a potent inhibitor of protein kinases, inhibited AA release by C5b-9, whereas AA release stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187 was not blocked by H-7. The results suggest that AA generation by C5b-9 from the ROC-1 clone involves activation of Ca2+-dependent phospholipase A2 which is regulated by protein kinase-dependent mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "M167, mu plus kappa, transgenic mice have been analyzed for the expression of the transgene product as a cell surface, Ag-specific receptor and for their ability to respond to Ag. The vast majority of B cells in these H + L transgenics (97 to 99%) express large amounts of the transgene product on their surface and are capable of binding phosphocholine. A total of 4 to 30% of the B cells also express endogenous IgM and IgD H chain products. After immunization with phosphocholine (PC)-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, more than 1000 micrograms/ml of anti-PC antibody bearing the transgene IgMa allotype marker are produced. Surprisingly, significant amounts of anti-PC antibodies that express the endogenous, IgMb allotype, are also produced; however, these antibodies lack the T15-idiotype which dominates the anti-PC response in their nontransgenic littermate controls. The B cells producing these endogenous anti-PC antibodies also fail to switch to IgG anti-PC synthesis, whereas B cells producing anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin antibodies readily undergo class switching. These last two observations may be due to the fact that the endogenous anti-PC antibody actually results from mixed mu a + mu b molecules in which the transgene encoded H and L chains are most likely responsible for the binding of PC. Thus, a switch of the endogenous isotype from mu b to IgG would result in a loss of specificity for PC in the IgG molecules produced using the endogenous VH-gene product(s), and mu a + gamma b hybrid molecules are not likely to be formed. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the majority of (mu a + mu b) hybridomas have the mu b-allotype joined with a VH region other than the VH1 gene which is required for PC-binding and T15 idiotype expression.\r"

Each of these recombinational events results in the replacement of the VH gene segment of the rearranged H chain gene (VhDJh) with that of an upstream germline gene segment. Replacements on the productive and nonproductive alleles have been observed. In each case, the recombination occurs in close proximity to a highly conserved heptameric sequence (5'TACTGTG3') which is located at the 3' end of the VH coding region. In the two examples of recombination on the productive allele that have been analyzed, the initial VHQ52 gene is replaced by different VH7183 genes. On the non-productive allele, sequential replacement events have been analyzed: the initial VHQ52 rearrangement is first replaced by a closely related VHQ52 gene, followed by a second replacement using a VHQ52 pseudogene. Southern blot analysis using VH probes indicates that these recombinations may be accompanied by the deletion of germline VH genes belonging to both the VHQ52 and VH7183 families, suggesting that these gene families are interspersed in the NFS/N mouse.\r"

To obtain direct evidence that members of these gene families are physically linked, an NFS/N liver library was constructed and genomic clones were analyzed for hybridization to both VHQ52 and VH7183 gene probes. Four clones were identified which contained both VHQ52 and VH7183 hybridizable restriction fragments. Two clones containing rearranged VHQ52 genes were also found to hybridize with the VH7183 gene probe. Sequence analysis of three of the VH7183-containing restriction fragments indicate that all are pseudogenes which contain interruptions at either the 5' and/or 3' ends of the VH coding region. Given the D-proximal location of at least a portion of the VHQ52 gene family relative to VH7183 in NFS/N mice, and the known correlation between D proximity and the frequency of VH gene utilization, 22 NFS/N-derived pre-B cell lines were analyzed for VHQ52 gene utilization. More than 40% of the identified H chain (VHDJH) rearrangements in this survey used members of this gene family. Furthermore, analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from NFS/N fetal liver and adult spleen also indicates preferential utilization of VHQ52 family in fetal liver. Kinetic studies show, however, that there are no changes in relative utilization throughout fetal ontogeny. The implications of these findings for the expression and randomization of the VH repertoire are discussed.\r"

We report a familial form of IgG1 deficiency, in which IgG1 was undetectable in a 5-yr-old girl with a history of asthma and respiratory tract infections. Her father had an IgG1 level that was one-third of the mean amount found in normal healthy controls. The defect in the proband was caused by a homozygous deletion of the structural gene for C gamma 1. A Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the maternal haplotype contained a deletion encompassing C gamma 1, C psi epsilon 1, C alpha 1, C psi gamma, and C gamma 2, whereas the deletion on the paternal haplotype was confined to the C gamma 1 gene. Neither of these deletions has previously been reported. IgG1 normally constitutes the dominant isotype for antibodies directed against protein Ag, including viral proteins. We have analyzed the immune response to a number of different protein and polysaccharide Ag in the patient and her parents. In the proband, antiviral antibodies were restricted to the IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses. However, the total amount of IgG directed against several viruses was below the concentration found in normal seropositive individuals. The father and the paternal grandfather, both with low serum IgG1 levels, also had asthma, thus indicating a possible causal relationship.\r"

Activated splenocyte supernatants inhibited keratinocyte colony growth on fibroblast feeder layers and arrested basal keratinocyte DNA synthesis within 24 h. Purified recombinant LT, TNF, and gamma IF inhibited cell proliferation in serum-free medium without noticeably affecting viability. Cytostasis was dose-dependent (up to 90% with LT or TNF and 99% with gamma IF) and was maximal within 24-36 h. Specific antibodies neutralized TNF- and gamma IF-mediated cytostasis. Combined treatment with LT (or TNF) and gamma IF increased the degree of cytostasis, particularly at low lymphokine concentrations. Maximum inhibition of DNA synthesis and the duration of exposure required for this inhibition were comparable for LT and TNF and differed for gamma IF. Each of these lymphokines induced cell enlargement, flattening, and vesiculation, with gamma IF apparently more potent in this respect than LT or TNF. Fusiform keratinocytes with diffusely distributed cytokeratin were observed after prolonged treatment with gamma IF alone or gamma IF plus either LT or TNF. Flow cytometric studies of lymphokine-treated keratinocytes indicated that LT, TNF, and gamma IF could enhance beta-2 microglobulin expression 1.5-fold to threefold, whereas only gamma IF induced class II antigens. Staining for class II and beta-2 microglobulin was reduced on cells treated with high concentrations of gamma IF compared with either optimally treated or untreated cells. The potential relevance of these findings to cutaneous immune defense and disease is discussed.\r"

In the presence of physiologic concentrations of Ca++ (1 microM) and Mg++ (1.5 mM), neither phosphatidylinositol (PI) nor phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were appreciably hydrolyzed. Addition of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) or guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S) significantly stimulated hydrolysis of PIP2, but not PI. Stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis by GTP was dose-dependent between 1-100 microM GTP. Other nucleoside triphosphates and nucleotide analogues were unable to substitute for GTP or GTP-gamma-S. A GTP-gamma-S-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis was inhibited by guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate (GDP-beta-S). The phospholipase C preparation specifically bound [35S]GTP-gamma-S and this binding was also inhibited by GDP-beta-S. In addition to a 41,000-dalton pertussis toxin substrate, the phospholipase C preparation contained 3-4 GTP binding proteins with molecular weights between 20,000-30,000. These data demonstrate that human epidermis contains a soluble GTP-dependent phospholipase C activity that specifically hydrolyzes PIP2 and suggest that this reaction is regulated by a GTP-binding protein(s).\r"

  ".W": "The cerebrospinal fluid of 52 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was incubated with polystyrene microspheres coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for HIV-1 core or envelope antigens. The beads were then collected on a filter surface and inspected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In 37 of 51 samples from subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection and from all three patients with primary HIV-1 infection, with or without neurologic symptoms, particles of 50-75 nm and 100-125 nm were visualized on beads coated with antibodies to HIV-1 core and envelope antigens, respectively. No such binding of particles was detected in the controls. Findings using immune SEM, which was found to be as sensitive as virus isolation, indicate that HIV-1 can replicate in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with primary or chronic HIV-1 infection without causing neurologic symptoms. Production of cell-free virus seems to occur in the CNS of the majority of HIV-1-infected patients.\r"

HEVAg was observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in 27 of 29 infected macaques in five passages of the diseases but not in uninoculated macaques or chimpanzees with various types of experimentally induced viral hepatitis. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by blocking tests using preinoculation, acute, and convalescent sera from ET-NANB hepatitis patients and from experimentally infected macaques. Concordant results of fluorescent antibody blocking and immune electron microscopy assays suggest that hepatocellular HEVAg is associated with 32- to 34-nm viruslike particles etiologically linked to disease. Antibodies to HEVAg were identified, and the titers were determined by using a fluorescent antibody blocking assay on liver tissue sections from macaques infected with ET-NANB hepatitis.\r"

Seven patients (8%) had P levels greater than 2 SD above the mean. Significant P elevations prior to hCG are infrequent with this protocol, and in the few patients with raised P a trend toward lowered fertilization was noted. The low incidence of P elevation may be secondary to the administration of hCG in a timely manner on the sixth day of estradiol (E2) rise.\r"

  ".W": "The likelihood of establishment of a term pregnancy from in vitro fertilization (IVF) is related to the estradiol (E2) pattern and peak level. To examine the influence of super high E2 peak levels (greater than or equal to 2000 pg/ml), we reviewed the clinical outcomes of all IVF cycles with follicular phase E2 levels greater than 2000 pg/ml from May 1982 through June 1987. Among 1651 IVF cycles initiated during this time, 102 cycles (6.2%) had super high E2 levels. Twenty-seven of these cycles occurred in 34 IVF attempts in 12 women. Stimulation was performed with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in 96 cycles and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in 6 cycles. A mean of 9.3 +/- 0.7 oocytes per cycle was recovered, of which 5.5 +/- 0.5 fertilized and underwent cleavage. In 11 cycles, with a mean of 6.8 oocytes recovered, none fertilized. Polyploid fertilization occurred in 23 of 90 cycles (25.6%), and 40 of 558 fertilized oocytes (7.2%). From these cycles, 10 clinical pregnancies (9.8%) have resulted: 6 pregnancies in 59 cycles with luteal-phase progesterone support (10.2%) and 4 pregnancies in 31 cycles without luteal-phase progesterone support (12.9%). Among the 1549 cycles with peak E2 levels less than or equal to 2000 pg/ml, 143 (9.2%) resulted in clinical pregnancies. We conclude that there is a small subset of patients who will have super high E2 responses to gonadotropin stimulation and that there is a tendency to stimulate repetitively in this fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89257070\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to identify suitable treatment regimens of human gonadotropin for superovulation of rhesus monkeys. At menses, female monkeys were given one of three regimens: Plan A [days 1 to 6, 60 IU human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH); days 7 to 9, 60 IU hFSH/60 IU human luteinizing hormone (hLH)], Plan B [days 1 to 3, 75 IU FSH/20 IU LH; days 4 to 6, 60 IU FSH/20 IU LH; days 7 to 9, 45 IU FSH/45 IU LH], or Plan C [days 1 to 9, 60 IU FSH/60 IU LH]. On day 10, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; 1000 IU) was administered. Serum estrogen levels peaked on the day of hCG treatment (day 10) in Plans A and C but earlier (day 8) in Plan B. An oviduct lavage recovered 1 to 3 oocytes in Plan B but 3 to 13 oocytes in the other treatment groups. Peak progesterone levels in the luteal phase were greater (P less than 0.05) in animals receiving Plan A or C than Plan B. Regardless of treatment group, progesterone levels declined abruptly 7 days after ovulation induction; the length of the luteal phase in all groups was significantly less than that of normal menstrual cycles. We conclude that regimens of hFSH and hLH (i.e., Plans A and C), followed by hCG, reliably superovulate rhesus monkeys. However, the premature decline in luteal function around the typical time of implantation may compromise pregnancy initiation and maintenance.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the potential role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in mild to moderate essential hypertension, a study was conducted in groups of normotensive and hypertensive middle-aged men born in 1926 and 1927. Venous plasma concentrations of immunoreactive ANP (irANP) were studied in relation to measurements of cardiac structure and function, urinary electrolytes as well as some cardiovascular hormones. Plasma irANP did not differ between normotensive controls (31 +/- 14 pmol l-1) and borderline or untreated hypertensive patients. However, irANP concentrations were slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in the borderline (26 +/- 8 pmol l-1) compared to the untreated established hypertensives (35 +/- 14 pmol l-1). No relationships were found between irANP and blood pressure, indices of left ventricular structure and function or hormone parameters in subgroups or the whole study group. Our data do not support the view that plasma irANP is increased in uncomplicated essential hypertension, since our groups of borderline or established hypertensive middle-aged men without major cardiac involvement did not differ in irANP concentrations compared to normotensive controls. Thus, during the development or in the early stages of essential hypertension, ANP secretion does not seem to be abnormal.\r"

All 10 patients responded on the change in treatment to gliclazide with an increase in activity of t-PA. However, after 12 months of treatment the t-PA activity in one of the 10 patients returned to the baseline level, whereas the remaining nine patients had a sustained increased t-PA activity compared to the period during treatment with tolbutamide. The concentration in plasma of t-PA antigen under basal conditions and after stimulation (venous occlusion) increased significantly during the period of treatment with gliclazide. The plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor remained unchanged throughout the study. In contrast to these findings seven patients with marked activities of t-PA during treatment with tolbutamide retained unchanged levels of the variables reported above after a change in treatment to gliclazide. Serum glucose, HBA1c, apolipoproteins A and B, and triglycerides remained constant throughout the study, whereas serum cholesterol showed a decrease in both groups of patients after 3 months (P less than 0.05) as well as after 12 months (P less than 0.05) of treatment with gliclazide. There was no significant relationship between serum cholesterol concentrations and plasma concentrations of t-PA antigen indicating that the increase in t-PA antigen was independent of the metabolic state of the patients.\r"

Cardiac volume (CV) and signs of PCG were compared to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured with isotope technique, and the prognostic value of all the parameters was assessed after 1 and 5 years. The accuracy of CV and PCG in predicting impaired LVEF was low (62% and 50% respectively). Although specificity is suboptimal, however, these parameters provided valuable prognostic information. For example, patients with signs of PCG had a very high 1 and 5 years' mortality, and two-thirds of those who died during the first year of observation had enlarged CV. The independent value of LVEF determination was mainly observed in re-AMI patients. A more restricted use of this expensive procedure may therefore be recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2) by mass spectrometry or infrared capnometry provides a clinically useful approximation of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) in intubated patients. Although several devices have been proposed to sample PETCO2 during spontaneous breathing (i.e., unintubated patients receiving supplemental oxygen), thus far no reports have documented their efficacy. This article reports the use of an easily constructed modification of simple nasal cannulae that permits accurate sampling of PETCO2 during oxygen administration to unintubated patients. After amputation of the closed tip, a cap from a syringe was inserted via a slit made at the base into one prong of a pair of nasal cannulae. A capnometer was connected to the syringe cap, and PETCO2 and PaCO2 were determined simultaneously during the administration of 3 L/min oxygen via nasal cannulae to 21 normocapnic patients. The PaCO2 - PETCO2 gradients were calculated and compared with values obtained in the same patients after intubation and mechanical ventilation. No significant difference was found between the calculated gradients with nasal cannulae (2.09 +/- 2.18 mm Hg) versus intubation (2.87 +/- 2.82 mm Hg). Simultaneous oxygen administration and accurate sampling of PETCO2 may be achieved in unintubated patients by using this easily constructed modification of nasal cannulae.\r"

Six groups of 20 rats were fed an AIN-76 diet modified to contain 20% fat from lard:corn oil (3:1 wt/wt) and various amounts of selenium (0.1, 0.035, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 mg Se/kg diet). At wk 5, animals in groups 2-6 were dosed with 4.32 mg of DMBA. Serum clinical parameters and the activities of plasma selenium-dependent and total glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), erythrocyte GSHPx and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined every 4 wk for 25 wk. The extent of lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring urinary malondialdehyde during wk 13 and 24, and erythrocyte malondialdehyde at wk 25. Erythrocyte GSHPx was found to be a better indicator of selenium status than plasma activity, while SOD did not vary with dietary selenium. The group of animals fed 4.0 mg Se/kg diet had reduced numbers of tumors (P less than 0.01), but this reduction was associated with evidence of chronic selenium toxicity. Variations in GSHPx activity with dietary selenium did not result in differences in tumor incidence, nor in changes in lipid peroxidation in the other groups. Thus, nontoxic levels of selenium do not appear to offer any protective effect during carcinogenesis in rats fed a casein-based diet similar in fat content to that consumed by North Americans.\r"

At the end of the experiment, rats were classified by tumor status, and each diet group was subdivided into two groups: those rats remaining free of tumors for 25 wk and those with tumors. DMBA treatment caused an initial decrease in erythrocyte SeGSHPx and SOD activity compared to untreated control rats.

  ".U": "89257767\r", 
  ".W": "Iron-deficient anemic rats have previously been shown to have low plasma levels of thyroid hormone and a poor plasma thyroid hormone response to acute cold exposure. As an initial exploration, we examined thyroid hormone metabolism during iron deficiency in age-matched rats from three aspects: 1) plasma TSH (thyrotropin, thyroid stimulating hormone), T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine) responses to graded doses of exogenous TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone), 2) plasma T3 kinetics, and 3) rates of hepatic T3 production. Iron-deficient anemic rats had lower basal TSH values and blunted TSH responses to intravenous TRH injection at three different doses (10, 25 and 50 ng TRH/100 g body wt). Iron-deficient anemic rats also had a significant decrease in plasma T3 turnover (42 vs. 88 ng/h in controls), and significantly lower hepatic T4-5'-deiodinase activities than controls [26 vs. 44.0 ng T3/(mg protein.20 min)]. Thus, decreased rates of T3 production in iron-deficient anemic rats, as documented by turnover studies, may be related to decreased deiodinase activity and reduced peripheral formation of T3. The dampened TSH responses to TRH further facilitate or perpetuate this T3 deficiency. We propose that this abnormal thyroid state is partially responsible for impaired thermogenesis in iron-deficiency anemia.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-one very low birth weight (less than or equal to 1500 gm) infants were studied to determine the sequential changes in serum vitamin D metabolite concentrations between infants with and without radiographically documented rickets, fractures, or both (R/F). Usual intake of vitamin D included 20 IU/kg/day from parenteral nutrition or 400 IU/day supplementation with enteral feeding. Radiographs of both forearms and serum samples were obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Twenty-two infants had R/F. At 3 months, significantly lower mean (+/- SEM) serum phosphorus levels (4.5 +/- 0.4 vs 6.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dl), higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-[OH]2D) concentrations (96 +/- 5 vs 77 +/- 4 pg/ml), and higher free 1,25-(OH)2D index (1,25-[OH]2D:vitamin D binding protein ratio; 5.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) vs 4.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(5] were found in the R/F group. These values returned to normal and were similar between groups on subsequent measurements. Serum calcium, magnesium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations were normal and similar between groups. In both groups, serum vitamin D binding concentrations increased initially but remained stable and normal beyond 6 months. We conclude that in very low birth weight infants with R/F, the vitamin D status (as indicated by serum 25-OHD concentrations) is normal, and that lowered serum phosphorus levels, higher serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels, and a higher free 1,25-(OH)2D index support the thesis that mineral deficiency (especially of phosphorus) may be important in the pathogenesis of R/F in small preterm infants.\r"

The maximally tolerated intralesional dose was less than 100 micrograms/m2 and the recommended intralesional dose was 25 micrograms/m2. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, rTNF reduced the cross-sectional area of 15 of 16 (94%) of the injected KS lesions and caused complete disappearance of 3 of 16 (19%) lesions. Only injected lesions showed a response. Rigors and fever were common dose-dependent side effects and were attenuated by meperidine. There were no changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity as determined by serum p24 antigen levels. While biologically active, the systemic toxicity of rTNF as well as the lack of distant antitumor effects in noninjected lesions limits its clinical usefulness under the conditions employed in this trial.\r"

Before heat inactivation/HIV donor screening of factor concentrates, many hemophilic children became infected with HIV. We evaluated four hemophilic groups without AIDS, using age-standardized growth parameters: group 1, 41 HIV-seropositive children (median age of 13 years); group 2, 11 HIV-seronegative children (median age of 4 years); group 3, 20 children frequently receiving concentrates, evaluated before 1979 (median age of 9 years); and group 4, 11 children rarely receiving concentrates, evaluated before 1979 (median age of 6 years). Median height for age (HA), weight for age (WA), and weight for height (WH) of groups 1 and 2 exceeded the 50th percentile of referent norms. HA, WA, WH, and weight/height did not vary significantly by group, nor did these decline over periods of 11 to 70 months. However, for those less than 11 years of age in group 1, HA declined by 25 percentile points over at least a 3 year period. Also, group 1's T helper-to-suppressor cell ratios at 12 +/- 3 months following the latest growth evaluation were positively associated with both HA and WA at the last evaluation. Eight children were evaluated before 1979 and again after they seroconverted to HIV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When trifenagrel was administered p.o. to guinea pigs, there was a sustained (greater than 3 hr) inhibition of AA- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo (1 hr ED50 = 1.4 and 9.4 mg/kg, respectively). In humans, trifenagrel inhibited the second phase of ADP-induced aggregation ex vivo up to 6 hr after a single dose of 100 to 300 mg p.o. The mechanism of action of trifenagrel appears to be a reversible inhibition of platelet AA cyclooxygenase. Doses of trifenagrel up to 100 mg/kg p.o. in rats and guinea pigs inhibited gastric mucosal AA cyclooxygenase but did not produce the gastric damage associated with the administration of other cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin and indomethacin. To our knowledge this is the first report of a compound which inhibits gastric mucosal prostaglandin levels but causes little or no gastrointestinal (g.i.) irritation in rodents. Although trifenagrel caused g.i. irritation in dogs and humans, the nature of the damage suggests that the compound may have acted as a local irritant in these species. Furthermore, compared to aspirin trifenagrel produced significantly less gastric irritation and fecal blood loss in humans. The physiochemical properties of trifenagrel may be important for the lack of g.i. irritation in rodents and for the diminished damage relative to aspirin in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The vasopressin (AVP) antagonist, SK&F 101926 (beta-mercapto-beta beta-cyclopentamethylene propionic acid1, D-Tyr(Et)2, Phe3, Val4, Asn5, Cys6, Pro7, Arg8-NH2), is an antidiuretic antagonist in rats and squirrel monkeys in vivo. In rat, dog, pig, squirrel monkey and human in vitro studies, SK&F 101926 is an AVP antagonist with no discernable agonist activity. Not predicted by these studies was the discovery that SK&F 101926 is an antidiuretic agonist in humans. The purpose of these studies was to show that indomethacin, which potentiates the antidiuretic activity of AVP in hydrated dogs, also potentiates the antidiuretic agonist activity of SK&F 101926, and to determine what structural modifications of this AVP antagonist would confer diminished agonist activity. Treatment of dogs with i.v. indomethacin (2 mg/kg bolus + 3 mg/kg/hr infusion, a dose which inhibited 80-90% of the urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion) unmasked the full antidiuretic activity of SK&F 101926. SK&F 104146 (Arg7-D-Arg8-NH2 peptide tail modification of SK&F 101926) in the presence of indomethacin caused a partial antidiuretic response. Replacement of the 1 to 6 disulfide bridge of SK&F 104146 with methylene groups to form a \"dicarba bridge\" resulted in SK&F 105494, a compound lacking antidiuretic agonist activity. Using the indomethacin-treated dog model, we have unmasked the full antidiuretic agonist activity of SK&F 101926 in nonhumans. In addition, both SK&F 104146 and 105494 blocked the antidiuretic agonist activity of SK&F 101926, suggesting that the agonist effect seen in the presence of indomethacin treatment is receptor mediated.\r"

  ".W": "We used the isolated perfused rat kidney to test the hypothesis that the renal pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are saturable and dependent on the method of administration. Wistar rat kidneys were perfused for 90 min after a bolus dose or continuous infusion of 45, 180, 450 ng of ANP. ANP clearance ranged from 3.27 to 2.28 ml/min after bolus administration. ANP clearance fell after infusion, resulting in a disproportionate increase in the ANP concentration with increasing infusion rate. The ANP half-life was unaffected by dose in the bolus group averaging 18 min. Increasing the ANP dose also increased the amount of Na excreted into the urine, but there were no differences between experimental groups. However, the area under the curve responsible for the natriuresis was 36 to 41% lower after infusion. Exogenous creatinine clearance, renal perfusion pressure and flow and renal vascular resistance were not affected. We conclude that the renal pharmacokinetics of ANP are saturable and are altered by the method of administration due to a down regulation of the ANP receptor. Furthermore, infusion of ANP should result in a greater net natriuresis due to resulting greater ANP concentrations at steady state and an apparent increased sensitivity of the kidney to ANP after infusion.\r"

Zaprinast, a selective inhibitor of the low Km-cyclic GMP (cGMP) phosphodiesterase [low Km cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE)], was equally effective in relaxing phenylephrine-contracted aortas from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) with an intact endothelium [EC50 = 7.6 (3.5-16.6) microM vs. 9.3 (4.1-21.3) microM, respectively]. In contrast, the vasorelaxant activity of zaprinast in intact and denuded phenylephrine-contracted guinea pig aortas, as well as denuded (SHR and WKY) aortas was minimal. Sodium nitroprusside and atriopeptin II were significantly (P less than .05) more potent as vasorelaxants in denuded SHR aortas when compared with denuded aortas from WKY. Pretreatment with zaprinast potentiated the vasorelaxant potency of sodium nitroprusside in both SHR and WKY aortas whereas atriopeptin II responses were potentiated only in WKY aortas. In studies with the low Km cGMP PDE, isolated via DEAE column chromatography, the apparent Km for cGMP and potency of zaprinast were approximately 2-fold greater (P less than .05) in WKY when compared with the same PDE isozyme isolated from SHR aortic preparations. However, the Vmax (picomoles per milligram per minute) for cGMP hydrolysis was greater in SHR than in WKY. In conclusion, these data show that, although there are no apparent differences in the influence of spontaneously released endothelium-derived relaxing factor from SHR and WKY aortas, reactivity differences to other agents known to stimulate guanylate cyclase activity exist between SHR and WKY denuded aortas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma samples containing radioactive peptides were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The major plasma metabolites were [125I]Tyr and [14C]Phe for the iodinated and 14C-labeled peptides, respectively. Both peptides had ANP(104/5-126) as a metabolite. Administration of labeled peptide by either bolus or infusion produced the same metabolite profile. To determine which enzymes were responsible for generating these initial metabolites, animals were first dosed with various protease inhibitors before the infusion of [14C]ANP(103-126). The amino-peptidase inhibitor bestatin and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril caused 54 and 66% increases in plasma ANP(103-126), respectively, but no other effects. Administration of the endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor thiorphan led to a 158% increase of ANP(103-126) in plasma and an 11-fold increase in ANP(104/5-126). The latter metabolite could be selectively decreased by pretreatment with bestatin in combination with thiorphan. The results demonstrate that the initial plasma metabolites of ANP(103-126) are due to the activity of endopeptidase 24.11, a bestatin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and a carboxypeptidase. The plasma clearance of the peptide is probably also due to cellular binding and uptake in combination with glomerular filtration as very few plasma metabolites were observed even at very high rates of ANP(103-126) infusion.\r"

BZ-receptor agonists such as flunitrazepam, diazepam, clonazepam and flurazepam enhanced the effect of submaximal concentrations of GABA (10 microM)-stimulated 36Cl influx. The rank order of potencies was flunitrazepam greater than clonazepam greater than diazepam greater than flurazepam. In contrast, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142) and ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5 alpha][1,4]-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513) inhibited GABA-stimulated 36Cl influx. The rank order of inhibitory potencies for the inverse agonists was DMCM greater than beta-CCE greater than Ro 15-4513 greater than FG 7142. Although lower concentrations of Ro 15-1788 antagonized the enhancement of BZ agonists like diazepam and the inhibition of inverse agonists like DMCM on GABA-stimulated 36Cl influx without exhibiting any effect per se, higher concentrations of Ro 15-1788 (greater than or equal to 10(-6) M) enhanced GABA-stimulated 36Cl influx. These observations indicate that flunitrazepam, diazepam, clonazepam and flurazepam are agonists; DMCM, beta-CCE, Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 are inverse agonists, whereas Ro 15-1788 is antagonist at lower concentrations and partial agonist at higher concentrations at the BZ receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The competitive NMDA antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) substituted for pentobarbital at doses that did not disrupt rates of responding. The proposed competitive NMDA antagonist NPC 12626 [2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid] also substituted for pentobarbital. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 did not antagonize the pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects of CPP. The noncompetitive NMDA antagonists phencyclidine and MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] produced a maximum average of only 42 and 38%, respectively, pentobarbital-lever responding at doses that also substantially reduced response rates. These results suggest that the competitive NMDA antagonists CPP and NPC 12626 share discriminative stimulus properties with pentobarbital. However, the pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects of CPP are probably not mediated through interaction with benzodiazepine receptors sensitive to Ro15-1788. In addition, because phencyclidine and MK-801 did not fully substitute for pentobarbital, these results provide further evidence for differences in the discriminative stimulus properties of competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists.\r"

Binding approaches performed with [3H]UK and [3H]CLO; two imidazoline derivatives exhibiting full and partial agonist properties, respectively, in biological assays clearly indicate that: 1) partial and full agonists label an equivalent number of binding sites corresponding to the high affinity form of the alpha-2 receptor; 2) there is some correlation between the KiH/KiL ratio defined in competition of [3H]yohimbine binding and the intrinsic activity defined in biological assays; 3) differences exist between the dissociation of the full-agonist ([3H]UK) and the partial-agonist ([3H]CLO); 4) the interaction of the full agonist with the alpha-2 receptor promotes the formation of an agonist-alpha-2 receptor-Gi protein complex (HRGi) complex which is more stable than that obtained with the partial agonist as objectivated by the sensitivity to the effects of guanosine 5'-(imido)triphosphate and N-ethylmaleimide; 5) the full-agonist is characterized by a \"tight agonist binding\" which is not observed with the partial agonist. From a functional point of view, the lower biological activity of the partial alpha-2 agonist could be explained by the formation of more labile HRGi complexes having weaker stability by comparison with the full agonist agents which promote stronger HRGi complexes and sustained activity.\r"

Hepatic cytochrome P450IA1 activity (determined by ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity) was induced maximally (30-fold) in both sham-operated and adrenalectomized rats 24 hr after a single injection of 3-methylcholanthrene (10 mg/kg). Dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) increased hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity 3- to 4-fold, but had little or no effect on ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. However, dexamethasone potentiated the 3-methylcholanthrene-dependent induction of hepatic P450IA1 activity 2- to 3-fold in adrenalectomized rats and 1.5- to 2-fold in sham-operated rats when administered concomitantly with 3-methylcholanthrene (P less than .05). The dose of dexamethasone required to potentiate 3-methylcholanthrene induction of P450IA1 activity (greater than 1 mg/kg) correlated well with the dose required to induce hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity; a marker of glucocorticoid action. Potentiation of 3-methylcholanthrene induction of P450IA1 activity in the rat appears to be tissue specific in that dexamethasone was found not to potentiate 3-methylcholanthrene induction of P450IA1 activity of rat lung or kidney. Cytochrome P450IA1 content induced by 3-methylcholanthrene in the liver was also potentiated 2- to 3-fold by dexamethasone. In contrast, potentiation of 3-methylcholanthrene induction of cytochrome P450IA2 content was not observed. Western blot analyses indicate that the increase in monooxygenase activity induced by 3-methylcholanthrene or 3-methylcholanthrene plus dexamethasone corresponds well only with the induction of cytochrome P450IA1 protein content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had active RA that was unresponsive to greater than or equal to 2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications and/or antimalarials. Eighteen patients were randomized to receive methotrexate (MTX) 12.5 mg weekly (oral and noncycled) + placebo, and 17 patients to gold sodium thiomalate (GSTM) 50 mg IM weekly + placebo (schedule I) after initial test dose of 10 and 25 mg. Dose reductions from Schedule I to Schedule II (i.e. MTX 5.0 mg and GSTM 25 mg) were permitted at Weeks 6 and 12. The GSTM group showed statistically significant improvement at Week 26 compared with baseline status in all of the clinical efficacy variables and the MTX group in 7. There were no statistically significant differences in these outcome variables between the 2 groups at Week 26. However, this small sample size may not have detected a clinically significant difference between treatment groups (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20). Two of the 18 patients treated with MTX and 6 of the 17 patients treated with gold withdrew because of drug toxicity, but this difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, GSTM and MTX are similarly efficacious in the short term treatment of RA.\r"

It is reasoned that perturbation of a second regulatory element in polyamine biosynthesis, i.e., the generation of propylamine groups from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), would potentiate the effectiveness of DFMO. Precursor availability for AdoMet was limited when rats were fed a low methionine diet. The diet of control rats was supplemented with 0.3% methionine. DFMO, when added to the diet at 0.1%, suppressed tumorigenesis, regardless of methionine levels, although its efficacy was significantly enhanced by the low methionine diet. Selenite, another effective chemopreventive agent in this tumor model, also requires AdoMet for its metabolism. However, the anticarcinogenic action of selenite is not compromised by low dietary methionine. The differential sensitivity of DFMO and selenium chemoprevention to low dietary methionine, therefore, provides an opportunity to test for an additive effect. Results of the combination regimen study showed that the incidence and yield of DMBA-induced mammary tumors were significantly lower in the two-agent protocol compared to either DFMO or selenite alone. The mechanism(s) that accounts for the heightened efficacy of combined DFMO and selenite chemoprevention will be discussed.\r"

This regimen was generally well tolerated as outpatient treatment. Because of the potential CNS effects of ifosfamide, we recommended that elderly patients, persons receiving high doses of opiates, and patients susceptible to the syndrome of vertigo, perspiration, and hypotension (without tachycardia) be hospitalized for treatment. At initial treatment, leukocyte count nadirs were less than 1,000/microL and platelet count nadirs were less than 100,000/microL in 38% and 15%, respectively, of the 39 patients for whom such data were available. Objective tumor regression occurred in approximately 16% (95% confidence interval, 7%-30%) of the 44 patients (six, partial responses; one, complete response). For the 44 patients, median time to disease progression was 2.3 months; median time to death was 9.4 months. While this regimen was effective in three of 20 patients who had been previously treated with a doxorubicin-based regimen, only one of the 12 patients whose tumors had been primarily refractory to the doxorubicin-based regimen experienced objective tumor regression on our ifosfamide-based regimen.\r"

The study identified TBI patients using ICD-9-Codes. The mean LOS for the two groups of patients with intracranial injury differed (p less than 0.05). Those with such an injury accompanied by a fracture stayed 1.8 days less in the ICU and 6.0 days less overall. Direct hospital charges for all TBI patients were $14,138,036 (mean, $11,645). Using Medicare weights and hospital-specific rates/DRG, the DRG reimbursement was $6,689,293. Thirty-day outliers (those who stayed ten times the geometric mean length of stay) provided an additional $526,389 leaving a total non-reimbursable figure of $6,922,354, or 49% of total charges. Of the 71 DRGs assigned to the study population, 15 reimbursed more than the actual charges. The severity of TBI victims and the complexity of caring for them in a Level I trauma center generates hospital charges of which only half are reimbursed through an all-payor DRG system. Strategies to correct what could be a financial disincentive are: documenting the uniqueness of this population to justify additional reimbursement, calculating a more precise mean LOS for TBI-related DRGs to more accurately identify outliers, and calculating DRG rates for TBI diagnoses derived from a representative sample at varying severity levels and hospitalized in facilities with and without rehabilitation services.\r"

In addition, ISS may be used as a rough guide to length of stay and the cost of care for the trauma patient. Three hundred thirty-seven patients entering a Level I Trauma Center were prospectively scored on a daily basis to determine the relationship between time following admission and accuracy. Overall, 18 patients (4.9%) required subsequent changes in their Injury Severity Scores after 24 hours. Patients having severe injury (ISS greater than 16) from blunt trauma had a higher likelihood of having \"delayed\" diagnosis that resulted in a slightly higher ISS.

Of the patients 21 were treated with 8 weekly intravesical instillations of 40 mg. mitomycin C after transurethral resection and 22 were followed conventionally. The recurrence rate was 42.9 per cent in the mitomycin C group and 40.9 per cent in the controls during the first 3 months, and it was 81.0 and 77.3 per cent, respectively during 24 months. Recurrences per 100 patient-months were 8.7 and 8.9, respectively. Two patients in the mitomycin C group and 4 controls had recurrent tumors with progression in stage. We conclude tentatively from these observations that intravesical mitomycin C instillation is not effective in the prophylaxis of tumor recurrence in patients at high risk. This finding is contrary to other reports indicating a marked decrease in recurrence with mitomycin C.\r"

To examine this possibility we studied the case mix, length of stay, and number of procedures for 65,032 patients listed as self-pay or free care, Blue Cross, or Medicaid at 52 hospitals in the Boston, Mass, area during 1983. We found that the overall case mix severity index (based on expected length of stay per diagnosis related group) for uninsured patients was 30% higher in public hospitals and 8% higher in major teaching hospitals compared with other institutions. Across all hospitals, the severity index of uninsured patients was similar to that of insured patients. However, after adjusting for diagnosis related group case mix, uninsured patients had, on average, 7% shorter stays (5.36 vs 5.79 days) and underwent 7% fewer procedures (1.16 vs 1.25) than Blue Cross patients, the differences varying with hospital type. Uninsured patients also had shorter stays on average than Medicaid patients (5.36 vs 5.87 days), but they underwent a similar number of procedures. These results suggest that patients who lack insurance may receive unequal treatment even after being hospitalized.\r"

In the present study we have investigated the efficacy of four clinical cardioplegic solutions in the immature myocardium to determine (1) whether cardioplegic protection could be demonstrated and, if so, (2) the relative efficacy of the four solutions. Isolated, working hearts (n = 6 per group) from neonatal rabbits (aged 5 to 8 days) were perfused aerobically (37 degrees C) for 20 minutes before a 2-minute infusion of one of four cardioplegic solutions: The St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2, Tyers, Bretschneider, and Roe solutions. Hearts were then rendered globally ischemic for 50 minutes at 37 degrees C before reperfusion for 15 minutes in the Langendorff mode and 20 minutes in the working mode. The postischemic recovery of cardiac function and leakage of creatine kinase were compared with results in noncardioplegic control hearts. Good protection was observed with the St. Thomas' Hospital and Tyers solutions: The postischemic recovery of cardiac output was increased from 21.2% +/- 12.7% in the cardioplegia-free group to 79.4% +/- 6.2% and 72.9% +/- 4.4%, respectively, in the St. Thomas' Hospital and Tyers groups (p less than 0.01).

Postischemic creatine kinase leakage was 72.4 +/- 12.3 and 92.1 +/- 18.6 IU/15 min/gm dry weight in the St. Thomas' Hospital and Tyers groups compared with 125.6 +/- 28.6 IU/15 min/gm dry weight in control hearts (p = no significant difference). In the Bretschneider group, creatine kinase leakage increased to 836.9 +/- 176.8 IU/15 min/gm dry weight (p less than 0.01 versus noncardioplegic control hearts), and with the Roe solution the value was 269.0 +/- 93.0 IU/15 min/gm dry weight (p = no significant difference). In conclusion, cardioplegic protection can be achieved in the immature rabbit myocardium with both St. Thomas' Hospital and Tyers solutions, but acalcemic solutions such as Bretschneider and Roe solutions (which may be effective in the adult heart) increased damage in this preparation. The reported lack of cardioplegic efficacy in the immature myocardium may therefore reflect the choice of cardioplegic solution rather than a greater vulnerability to injury in the neonatal heart.\r"

  ".W": "The physical and mechanical effects of injecting crystalloid cardioplegic solution under various pressures and flows was studied (in canine hearts) to establish a safe method for administering it in the presence of normal coronary arteries. A constant pressure system (300 mm Hg = 15 psi) was maintained in the solution reservoir, and flows and pressures were varied with the use of cannulas of different inner diameters: 0.8, 1.35, 1.6, 2.3, 2.58, and 2.80 mm. Cardioplegia distribution was measured by 15 microns radioactive microspheres. Peak flow rate, total flow, and mean flow rate per infusion were measured by an inline electromagnetic flowmeter probe. Direct aortic root pressure, time to standstill, and myocardial temperatures were recorded by continuous monitoring. Cardiac isoenzymes were measured in the coronary sinus, peripheral blood, and directly in the myocardial tissue. Histologic changes in the left ventricle were examined by light microscopy. The results showed that the higher the flow and pressure, the shorter the prearrest period, the better the flow distribution, and the faster the myocardial temperature drop. Mean aortic root pressures higher than 110 mm Hg and peak flow rates greater than 1500 ml/min caused a higher incidence of mechanical-physical trauma to the vascular endothelium and the endocardium, but cellular protection was good. Low pressure (less than 30 mm Hg) and peak flows (less than 125 ml/min) showed a higher incidence of cellular (myocardial) ischemia, focal necrosis, and uneven flow distribution. An aortic root pressure of 61 +/- 5 mm Hg, a mean peak flow rate of 622 +/- 52 ml/min, and a total flow of 600 ml for the first injection seem to offer the best cellular protection with minimal physical injury to the endothelium and endocardium for a mean canine heart weight of 236 gm.\r"

The following modifications of the original Stanford technique were designed: (1) Back bleeding from the graft is avoided; (2) dissection of the posterior mediastinum is limited as much as possible, with only the tracheobronchial bifurcation being dissected free; (3) surgical stapling is extensively used to optimize hemostasis; (4) the surgical procedure is kept away from the phrenic and vagus nerves; (5) early corticosteroid therapy is avoided and the tracheal anastomosis may be wrapped with a pedicle of great omentum. These techniques were used in 21 patients. Postoperative bleeding remained minimal and never necessitated reoperation. There was no instance of phrenic nerve palsy. Dehiscence of the tracheal anastomosis occurred in two patients during the initial experience, but in subsequent patients this complication was prevented by adequate improvements (omentoplasty and avoidance of corticosteroids). Our technical modifications may reduce the risk of early surgical complications and thereby improve the early outcome and leave the patient in better condition to face the other hazards of heart-lung transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "The concept of using laser energy to perform stapedotomy and stapedectomy revision is an attractive one. Precision of vaporizing a perfectly round 0.6- to 0.8-mm hole in the stapes footplate, regardless of its thickness or degree of fixation, would introduce an elegant simplicity to a sometimes difficult operation while eliminating mechanical trauma to the inner ear. When revising a previously failed stapedectomy, lasers should enable the otologic surgeon to atraumatically vaporize the obliterating oval window tissue and thus precisely diagnose the cause of the failure. A laser stapedotomy could then be performed in the membranous oval window, thus minimizing the risk of recurrent prosthesis migration. To accomplish these objectives, lasers must possess physical properties which permit the precise controlled delivery of laser energy to the microscopic operative field. Tissue characteristics of this laser energy should permit the vaporization of the stapes footplate or oval window soft tissue without thermal effect to the vestibule and without passing through the perilymph to damage the delicate structures of the inner ear. Two types of lasers have been successfully used for otosclerosis surgery: the visible lasers (Argon and KTP-532) and the invisible CO2 laser. This paper explores relative merits and disadvantages of each. The visible lasers possess ideal optical properties for microsurgery and, until recently (1984), were the only group of lasers optically precise enough for safe use on the oval window. Unfortunately, the short wavelength of these visible lasers (0.5 mu) impart tissue properties which are less than ideal for otosclerosis surgery. Visible laser is only partially absorbed by the white stapes footplate and readily passes through the perilymph to be absorbed by pigmented tissue of the inner ear (blood vessels, neuroepithelium, etc.). Therefore, the Argon and KTP-532 lasers should be used with caution while performing stapedotomies. Visible lasers should not be used for stapedectomy revisions since direct application of visible laser energy to the open vestibule produces dramatic temperature rises (up to 175 degrees C) in the vestibule at the level of the utricle and saccule. The long wavelength of the invisible CO2 laser (10.6 mu) imparts many optical problems which limit its precision for microscopic surgery. Until recently, the CO2 laser was too inaccurate for otosclerosis engineering advances for CO2 microsurgery. A newly designed microslad optical delivery system could deliver a 0.3-mm spot size CO2 beam at 250-mm focal length which was satisfactorily par-focal and coaxial with the aiming HeNe beam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This clinical study was preceded by two laboratory experiments. The first experiment compared temperature changes in the vestibule while vaporizing a 0.6-mm stapedotomy with Argon, KTP-532, and CO2 lasers. Data demonstrated that the CO2 laser possesses superior tissue characteristics for stapedotomy. In the second experiment safe energy parameters were established for various Sharplan CO2 laser models. Using these safe power settings, 153 consecutive CO2 laser stapedotomies were performed under local anesthesia. No patient experienced intraoperative dizziness during or immediately following the application of the CO2 laser to the stapes footplate. Long-term postoperative hearing results demonstrated that 87% of the patients maintained an air/bone gap to within 10 dB and 94% maintained an air/bone gap to within 15 dB (mean follow-up 32 months). No patient incurred a significant sensorineural hearing loss (greater than 10 dB) in the speech range. Four patients developed a perilymph fistula (three immediate and one delayed) and fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, but all were successfully repaired without significant permanent nerve deafness. At 4,000 Hz, five patients lost 20 dB and two patients dropped 40 dB compared with preoperative levels. Postoperative complications included four perilymph fistulas, two prostheses displaced from the stapedotomy opening, one fixed prosthesis, and one fixed incus. Seven of eight of these complications were successfully revised. At the time of this writing, 6/153 patients have a persistent conductive hearing loss greater than 20 dB and have not been revised. Using appropriate energy parameters, the CO2 laser provides a safe, efficient microsurgical tool for performing stapedotomy simply and with minimum inner ear trauma.\r"

Ultrasensitive pyroelectric detectors analyzed the precise energy package delivered to the operative field with each of these power setting. Subsequently, 0.6-mm stapedotomy and stapedectomy revisions were performed under simulated operating room conditions while measuring temperature changes in the vestibule with a thermocouple. Table I illustrates safe energy settings for each of the Sharplan CO2 models tested. These power settings produced no more than 0.3 degrees C temperature rise in the vestibule during stapedotomy, and no more than 0.5 degrees C during stapedectomy revision. Following these guidelines, the CO2 laser was then employed to perform stapedotomy and stapedectomy revisions in otosclerosis patients. In over 200 consecutive operations performed under local anesthesia with the CO2 laser, no patient became dizzy intraoperatively while the CO2 laser was applied to the stapes footplate or the oval window neomembrane, confirming the lack of significant caloric effect to the inner ear at these energy settings. More importantly, no patient has yet experienced significant sensorineural hearing loss in the speech range.\r"

  ".W": "Fibrous collagen from normal (line 412) and dystrophic (line 413) chicken pectoral muscles was examined for susceptibility to bacterial collagenase by a pH-stat titration method to assess the kinetics of peptide bond hydrolysis. These experiments showed that there was a profound difference in the kinetics of hydrolysis using fibrous collagen purified from normal and dystrophic muscle. Although normal collagen was readily hydrolyzed by the collagenase, dystrophic collagen was not hydrolyzed in the presence of 200 microM Ca and was hydrolyzed slowly in the presence of 5 mM Ca. At this high Ca concentration, the Km for collagenase was six times higher in dystrophic collagen than in normal, whereas the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) remained the same. After CNBr digestion, peptides from both sources were readily hydrolyzed by collagenase in the presence of 200 microM Ca, and there was no noticeable difference in the reaction kinetics. The above results were not modified whether the chicken was sacrificed on day 4 or day 98 post-hatching, and the insusceptibility to collagenase preceded the clinical manifestations of dystrophy. The structure of both fibrous and CNBr-treated collagen from normal and dystrophic muscle was compared. One and two-dimensional gel electrophoreses showed identical peptide maps. Gel filtration of CNBr peptides showed in the excluded volume the presence of twice as much high-molecular-weight (presumably crosslinked) peptides from dystrophic collagen compared with normal. We conclude that the intermolecular crosslinks are more extensively formed in dystrophic collagen and that this increased crosslinking results in the increased resistance of the dystrophic collagen to collagenase.\r"

  ".W": "We speculated that prophylactic ligation of the ductus arteriosus would reduce mortality and morbidity in very-low-birth-weight infants. To test this hypothesis, we randomly assigned 84 babies who weighed 1000 g or less at birth and required supplemental oxygen either to receive standard treatment (n = 44) or to undergo prophylactic surgical ligation of the ductus arteriosus on the day of birth (n = 40). The ductus was ligated in babies in the control group only if the shunt was hemodynamically important. All the babies were followed for one year. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis was reduced in the group that underwent prophylactic ligation (3 of 40 [8 percent]) as compared with the control group (13 of 44 [30 percent]; P = 0.002). The frequency of death, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage was similar in both groups. Because early enteral feeding may have increased the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, we analyzed separately the babies who were fed early. Among the infants who were fed within 14 days of birth, those who underwent prophylactic ligation had a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (1 of 11 [9 percent]) than those who did not (13 of 24 [54 percent]; P = 0.001). Within the control group, the infants who were fed within 14 days of birth and whose ductus was ligated for medical reasons within 5 days of birth had a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (2 of 10 [20 percent]) than those whose ductus was ligated later or not at all (11 of 14 [79 percent]; P = 0.004). We conclude that early surgical closure of the ductus arteriosus reduces the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in infants of very low birth weight who require supplemental oxygen.\r"

The patients (mean age, 61 years) were studied before and after two months of placebo and two months of treatment with a sustained-release preparation of theophylline (10 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), administered orally. The two treatments were administered in a random order and separated by an eight-day washout period. After taking theophylline for two months (mean plasma concentration, 14.8 mg per liter), as compared with the two months of placebo, the patients had significant improvements in dyspnea, pulmonary gas exchange (partial pressure of arterial oxygen, 66 vs. 61 mm Hg [P less than 0.0001]; partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, 44 vs. 49 mm Hg [P less than 0.0001]), vital capacity (63 percent vs. 58 percent of the predicted value [P less than 0.0001]), and forced expiratory volume in one second (36 percent vs. 32 percent of the predicted value [P less than 0.0001]), with no significant change in airway resistance or functional residual capacity. Minute ventilation increased by a mean of 18 percent (P less than 0.0001) in the patients taking theophylline because of increased tidal volume, with no change in respiratory frequency. The respiratory-muscle performance of the patients taking theophylline improved by approximately 29 percent (P less than 0.0001), as indicated by a decline in the ratio of inspiratory pleural pressure during quiet breathing to maximal pleural pressure. We conclude that theophylline improves respiratory function and dyspnea in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that these improvements are probably due to better respiratory-muscle performance.\r"

Some observers contend that the amounts have been inadequate, but until now there has been no overall accounting of federal activities and spending to combat the epidemic. We report expenditure data collected from federal agencies for the years 1982 to 1989. In all, $5.5 billion will have been spent on HIV-related illness during this period by the federal government, nearly 60 percent of it by the U.S. Public Health Service. Federal spending on HIV-related illness in 1989 will reach $2.2 billion, representing over one third of all estimated national (public and private) HIV expenditures, and tripling state expenditures. In 1992, federal spending on the epidemic will reach an estimated $4.3 billion. Although sizable, this will be just 1.8 percent of all 1992 federal health dollars. Similarly, in 1992, national (public and private) spending on HIV-related illness will consume roughly 1.6 percent of all health-related costs in the United States. Federal spending for HIV research and prevention is similar to funding for other major diseases, including some conditions, such as cancer and heart disease, that now have a greater impact on mortality.\r"

  ".W": "Measles is associated with alterations in immune regulation that sometimes lead to secondary infections or autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Simultaneously, an effective measles virus-specific immune response develops. To relate immune activation to measles and its complications, we studied the spontaneous proliferation of blood mononuclear cells and circulating levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and CD8 T-cell antigens in 126 patients with complicated or uncomplicated measles at various stages of the disease. Spontaneous proliferation of mononuclear cells, which was present through the first week of the rash, was greater in cells from patients with measles (8787 +/- 1403 cpm) than in those from healthy children (1529 +/- 237 cpm, P less than 0.0001). Levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (3385 +/- 195 units per milliliter) and CD8 (4145 +/- 437 units per milliliter) were higher in patients with measles than in those with other infectious diseases (2377 +/- 440, P = 0.003; 2399 +/- 771, P = 0.0374) or in healthy children (865 +/- 138, P less than 0.0001; 1026 +/- 169, P less than 0.0001). Levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor were elevated before the onset of the rash and remained elevated for several weeks. In contrast, levels of soluble CD8 increased only when the rash appeared, and subsided quickly. Spontaneous proliferation of mononuclear cells and levels of soluble CD8 were similar in patients with uncomplicated disease, pneumonia, or encephalomyelitis, but soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were lower in patients with encephalomyelitis (2312 +/- 314 vs. 3455 +/- 247 units per milliliter in uncomplicated measles; P = 0.01). In patients with encephalomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid levels of soluble CD8 (686 +/- 350 units per milliliter), but not interleukin-2 receptor (9 +/- 8.3 units per milliliter), were increased. We conclude that the proliferative phase of the immune response, as measured by the release of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, begins before the rash appears, continues for several weeks in those without complications, but does not occur within the nervous system. In contrast, the effector phase of the immune response, as measured by the release of soluble CD8, coincides with the appearance and disappearance of the rash and occurs within the nervous system during encephalomyelitis.\r"

  ".W": "Many hormones, neurotransmitters and growth factors evoke in their target cells oscillations in the free internal Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i). In electrically non-excitable cells these fluctuations are due to periodic release of Ca2+ from intracellular reservoirs, stimulated by the internal messenger inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). Most models at present invoke fluctuating levels of InsP3 as a key component in generating the oscillations in [Ca2+]i. InsP3 injected into intact cells evokes irregular and transient oscillatory Ca2+-dependent current responses, but the intracellular InsP3 concentration is not constant in such experiments. Here we monitor changes in [Ca2+]i by measuring Ca2+-activated Cl- current in single internally perfused mouse pancreatic acinar cells and show that acetylcholine (ACh), acting through muscarinic receptors, evokes regular and repetitive current pulses which are mimicked by InsP3 applied through a patch pipette. To exclude the possibility that InsP3 is periodically phosphorylated or degraded, we replaced it by the non-metabolizable InsP3 analogue inositol trisphosphorothioate (InsPS3), which also evokes regular pulses of Ca2+-activated Cl- current. These effects are independent of external Ca2+, but abolished by high intracellular concentrations of a Ca2+-chelator. We conclude that repetitive pulses of intracellular Ca2+ release occur even when the concentration of InsP3 is constant.\r"

Antibody-toxin conjugates (immunotoxins) produced using conventional chemical coupling techniques have several undesirable characteristics. The smallest binding unit of an antibody is an Fv fragment which consists of a light and heavy chain variable domain. Recently, active single chain Fv fragments of antibodies have been produced in Escherichia coli by attaching the light and heavy chain variable domains together with a peptide linker. Here we describe the construction and expression in E. coli of a single chain antibody toxin fusion protein, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40, in which the variable regions of anti-Tac, a monoclonal antibody to the p55 subunit of the human interleukin-2 receptor, are joined in peptide linkage to PE40, a modified form of Pseudomonas exotoxin lacking its binding domain. Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was very cytotoxic to two interleukin-2 receptor-bearing human cell lines but was not cytotoxic to receptor-negative cells.\r"

An efficient visual system should be able to direct attention to those parts of the visual field that contain such stimuli. What is needed is a system that can filter by movement difference. This could direct attention to a moving item among stationary items, or an item moving in one direction against a background moving in a different direction. Visual search experiments have shown that people are indeed able to filter by movement; that is, they can attend to just the moving items in arrays of moving and stationary stimuli. Single-cell recordings from monkey visual cortex show that the medial temporal cortical area (MT) has some of the properties required to filter by movement. We have now linked these two observations by showing that a patient with bilateral lesions to the presumed human homologue of MT cannot restrict visual attention to the moving items in arrays of both moving and stationary items. This suggests that MT is the site of a movement filter used in normal visual processing.\r"

  ".U": "89262087\r", 
  ".W": "Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease of the intestinal mucosa, elicited by ingestion of wheat gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Susceptibility to coeliac disease has been associated with the serologically defined variants DR3 and DR7 of the class II antigens encoded by the HLA-D region. Three related class II antigens, each consisting of an alpha and a beta glycoprotein chain, have been identified and are designated HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP. These highly polymorphic transmembrane proteins bind peptides derived from the processing of foreign antigens and present them to T lymphocytes; they also influence the specificity of the mature T-cell repertoire. The role of HLA-DP polymorphism in susceptibility has not been as fully explored as that of the other class II antigens because of the complexity of the primed lymphocyte typing (PLT) method for determining DPw specificities. Here we use a new DNA-based method of HLA-DP typing to analyse the distribution of DP beta alleles in a group of coeliac disease patients and healthy controls. Two specific DP beta alleles (DPB4.2 and DPB3) are increased in the patient population. Comparison of the DP beta sequences suggests that the polymorphic residues at position 69 and at 56 and 57 may be critical in conferring susceptibility. Further, the contribution of the susceptible DP beta alleles appears to be independent of linkage to the previously reported DR3 and DR7 markers for coeliac disease. The distribution of DQ alpha and beta alleles in patients suggests that a specific DQ heterodimer may be responsible for the observed DR associations. Individuals with both this DQ antigen and a specific DP beta allele are at increased risk for coeliac disease.\r"

  ".W": "This article has attempted to describe an approach to the assessment and management of the child with choanal atresia whose airway abnormality is one component of a multiple anomaly condition (CHARGE association). The risks to the child with CHARGE association exceed those of any one of his or her anomalies, and the clinician must assess the child deliberately, realizing that morbidity may be increased if any of the child's other systemic anomalies are given a secondary role in long-term management. The CHARGE association baby is an atypical choanal atresia patient, as he or she is an atypical cardiac or hearing-impaired patient; for each child there may be a logical approach to prioritizing such issues as nutrition, airway management, and cardiovascular support. Unlike known \"syndromes\" in which natural history may be definable, the child with CHARGE association depends considerably on the effects of various interventions to determine outcome. Some basic principles useful in guiding these interventions have been presented to assist the clinician in this process.\r"

These requirements will also be more complex because of the prevalence of other diseases in the elderly and their varied social and psychological demands. To meet that need, additional research in head and neck disorders and physiology will be necessary. Current and newly developed information relating to geriatrics in otolaryngology must be incorporated into present training and continuing education programs to provide members of our specialty with enough background to adequately diagnose and treat head and neck disorders in the elderly. Otolaryngologist - head and neck surgeons and their elderly patients will benefit from the creation of centers and fellowships that study pathologic processes and normal physiologic change, and that train a new generation of physician-scientists committed to the care of elderly head and neck patients.\r"

Five years after their initial treatment, seven patients were alive and free of disease. Radiation therapy controlled local and regional disease in 10 (77%) patients, yet three of these died of distant metastasis. Patients with lymphoepithelioma have a significantly better prognosis (p less than 0.05) than do patients with either nonkeratinizing or keratinizing high-grade oropharyngeal carcinoma. Early recognition and combined therapy may further improve the prognosis. Differentiation of lymphoepithelioma from other high-grade squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx is important to guide treatment and to provide prognostic information.\r"

Cochlear blood flow was measured using a laser Doppler flow monitor. Systemic blood pressure was monitored from a cannula within the common carotid artery. Electrical stimulation increased cochlear blood flow, while systemic blood pressure was unaffected. A cochlear blood flow response parameter, normalized for transient changes in systemic blood pressure, was defined. The magnitude of the response parameter was found to be frequency selective and was also found to be an increasing function of current intensity, with maximum responses obtained with 500 Hz sinusoids. This cochlear blood flow response was not observed in dead animals; was present in preparations paralyzed with gallamine hydrochloride; and was correlated with an increase in cochlear red blood cell velocity, as directly observed by intravital microscopy. These observations imply that electrical stimulation induces a local vasodilation within the temporal bone. The fact that decreased cochlear blood flow was never observed with current injection implies that ischemia is not a likely mechanism of electrically induced tissue damage within the inner ear. The mechanism of this cochlear blood flow response is addressed in a companion report.\r"

A system consisting of a disposable anesthesia mask attached to a flowmeter was used to teach children to perform autoinflation based on a modified Valsalva technique. Subjects were stratified according to their ability to achieve tubal opening as assessed by tympanometry and tubosonometry. Subjects were randomly assigned to either treatment or observation group and were followed weekly for 2 weeks; subjects in the treatment group attempted inflation three times each day for 2 weeks. Of the 19 subjects who were in the autoinflation group, only one (5.3 percent) was effusion-free at the two-week endpoint and of the 21 subjects in the control, only two (9.5 percent) were without middle-ear effusion. Autoinflation was ineffective for treatment of children with otitis media with effusion in our study.\r"

Participants were asked to evaluate the level of knowledge and skills necessary for students to attain in various areas of otolaryngology by ranking each item by a score of 0 to 3 according to its required depth of knowledge or skill. A rank \"order of importance\" was developed based on mean scores. The highest-ranking areas of knowledge were otitis media, airway obstruction, tonsillitis, and croup/epiglottitis, whereas the highest-ranking skills were history and physical examination of the head and neck, throat cultures, and use of the otoscope and pneumatoscope. The lowest-ranking areas of knowledge were voice disorders and ear deformities, whereas the lowest-ranking skills were interpreting electronystagmograms and stapedial reflex testing. We review the findings of our survey and comment on their role in undergraduate curriculum planning for otolaryngology.\r"

When complications occur, gastrointestinal disturbances are most frequently encountered, followed by mechanical and metabolic complications. Nurses can prevent many of the problems associated with enteral feeding through careful monitoring. Based on the current literature, the authors make the following recommendations: 1. All patients receiving tube feedings should be placed on a protocol that provides guidelines for (a) confirming correct tube placement; (b) preventing/managing tube obstruction; (c) handling and selecting formulas; (d) administering formulas; and (e) monitoring patients. 2. Fine-bore tubes are easily misplaced or dislodged; ensure correct positioning both before and during feeding. Food coloring should be added to all feedings to help detect aspiration/tube displacement. 3. Multiple factors can cause diarrhea in tube-fed patients and, therefore, require periodic assessment. These factors include concomitant drug therapy; malnutrition/hypoalbuminemia; formula-related factors (for example, lactose content, osmolality); and bacterial contamination. 4. Urine sugar and acetone levels should be checked every 6 hours (until stable). Vital signs and fluid intake and output should be determined every 8 hours, and weight should be measured on a daily basis. Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose levels should be determined daily, until serum levels stabilize. Weekly measurements of trace elements should be made to ensure adequate mineral replacement. 5. Use a controller pump to administer continuous feedings at a constant rate or to administer formulas that are viscous. Flush feeding tubes with water every 4 hours during continuous feedings, after giving intermittent feedings, after giving medications, and after checking for gastric residuals. If tube obstruction occurs, attempt to irrigate the tube with either water or cola. 6. Select feedings that contain appropriate nutrient sources, caloric density, and osmolality; handle feedings in a way that minimizes bacterial contamination. 7. Ongoing nutritional assessments are necessary to provide information about the overall adequacy of the enteral feeding in restoring or maintaining nutrition.\r"

  ".W": "AIDS-related gastrointestinal disease is common, presenting a challenge to all nutritional support clinicians. Patients frequently suffer from weight loss, diarrhea, malabsorption, and cachexia. Many factors complicate the course of AIDS-related gastrointestinal disease, including decreased food intake (resulting from fatigue and malaise), increased metabolic demand and nutritional requirements, and identifiable gastrointestinal pathology. Gastrointestinal pathology is well-documented, and in approximately 50% of persons with AIDS-related gastrointestinal disease, a causative agent can be identified. In general, treatment of AIDS-related gastrointestinal disease is not always curative. Much of the chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction is caused by recurring opportunistic pathogens that are resistant to chemotherapy. Often, patient care and long-term management can focus only on fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional support, and symptom control. Even clinically stable patients have been diagnosed as chronically malnourished and, for reasons that remain unclear, are prone to rapid nutritional deterioration during disease exacerbations. Published reports of nutritional assessment and intervention in persons with AIDS are now appearing in the literature. However, the eventual mortality associated with AIDS still results in a hesitancy on the part of many clinicians to prescribe aggressive nutritional support, especially parenteral nutrition. Who to treat and at what stage of illness becomes the question. As new agents, such as AZT, are prescribed on a more frequent basis for persons with AIDS, the use of nutritional support as adjunctive therapy early in the course of disease becomes an issue. Although improving nutrition has not been shown to reverse any of the cellular immunodeficiency caused by HIV infection, quality of life may be improved. In specific cases, nutritional support, whether through diet counseling, food programs, or intervention with enteral or parenteral nutrition, appears to improve strength and endurance, thus enhancing quality of life.\r"

Weaning of a patient from the ventilator can be difficult or impossible if the patient is malnourished, receives too much carbohydrate, or develops hypophosphatemia.

  ".W": "The concepts of individual adaptations, environmental, and person factors have been suggested as components of a framework for considering existing and potential investigations of enteral feeding as a therapeutic modality. Much of the work regarding adaptations to enteral feeding have described the pathophysiological and experimental responses of individuals--that there is less emphasis on the physiological and behavioral responses is evident in the literature. Also, little investigation has been focused on the environmental risk factors or the person vulnerability factors that are associated with less than optimal adaptations to enteral feeding. However, it is the understanding of all three of these aspects that will lead to comprehensive strategies for promoting satisfactory adaptations. To date, the majority of clinical therapeutic studies have focused on obviating or managing untoward reactions to enteral feeding by manipulating environmental physical factors. Certainly, more needs to be done, particularly with respect to temporal and rhythmicity considerations. However, there is an obvious lack of information about manipulating social circumstances or person factors (such as, knowledge deficit) for therapeutic ends. Examination of the multiple dimensions of patient responses to enteral nutrition modalities, the interaction of these various dimensions (concentrating on the social and person), and the physical elements is congruent with the holistic and caring nature of nursing practice and should guide future study.\r"

Provision of nutrition through artificial means is an invasive medical intervention. As such, procedures for supplying nutritional support impose burdens as well as provide benefits and may, under certain circumstances, be foregone. However, the needs of the vast majority of dying patients will best be served by providing specialized nutritional support.\r"

  ".W": "Nutritional support was among the first of the high-tech therapies to make the transition from hospital to home. Growth in high-tech home care accelerated in the mid-1980s, following establishment of the prospective payment system. Rapid growth in home care continues amid acquisitions and mergers of home care companies. The HPN and HEN populations have both enlarged and evolved with time, and the current populations mirror changes in health care demographics--showing the largest increases in services to the elderly. Changes have occurred in the types of venous and enteral access devices, infusion systems, parenteral and enteral products, and infusion schedules used by HPN and HEN patients. As therapies have caused less disruption in patients' lifestyles and as services have become more widely available, adaptation to HPN and HEN has become somewhat less difficult. However, patients still report concerns over finances, respite services, and symptoms management. Nurses have a primary role in the preparation of patients for home nutritional support and in the provision of home care services. Nursing research can illuminate the unique contribution of nurses to safe, cost effective, and high quality home nutritional support.\r"

  ".W": "In many cases, initiation of specialized nutritional support is a final attempt at medically managing illness for which other treatments have failed. Patients may have suffered for months or even years with their underlying diseases and are usually aware that poor response to nutritional support and concurrent therapies may lead to surgical intervention or more complex treatment. In some cases, there may be few alternatives left to pursue. For such patients, this paints a very stressful picture. If we as caregivers are empathetic to each patient's situation, we are better able to offer the support that these patients need. Health care professionals must keep patients informed of treatment plans and encourage participation in the planning process--during hospitalization, through the discharge phase, and after hospitalization. We need to pay close attention to those needs, whether nutritional support is short-term during hospitalization, prolonged, or permanent. The health care environment is demanding greater proficiency in cost containment and quality assurance in the delivery of care. Complex patient cases are becoming more difficult to manage as time constraints and resources become more restrictive. The ingenuity and imagination of health care providers trying to find ways to continue providing high-quality and safe care to patients are being tested daily. These worthwhile goals can be met only through cooperation, communication, and support among all levels and disciplines involved with the delivery of care. Feelings of helplessness, dependence, and loss of control can be diminished if health care providers maintain optimistic, confident attitudes, offer positive reinforcement for patients successes, and try to restore hope during this stressful period in patients' lives.\r"

To demonstrate the potential significance of these plasmenylethanolamines as substrates for the smooth muscle cell phospholipases that are activated during agonist stimulation, aortic rings were prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and stimulated with angiotensin II. Although the specific activities of the choline and inositol glycerophospholipid pools were similar after the labeling interval, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids had a specific activity of only 20% of the specific activity of choline and inositol glycerophospholipids. Despite the marked disparity in the specific activities of these three phospholipid classes, angiotensin II stimulation resulted in similar fractional losses (35-41%) of [3H]arachidonic acid from vascular smooth muscle choline, ethanolamine, and inositol glycerophospholipid classes. Reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that greater than 60% of the [3H]arachidonic acid released from ethanolamine glycerophospholipids after angiotensin II stimulation originated from plasmenylethanolamine molecular species. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the major phospholipid storage depot for arachidonic acid in vascular smooth muscle cells are plasmenylethanolamine molecular species which are important substrates for the phospholipase(s) that are activated during agonist stimulation.\r"

Expression of a pADPRT cDNA under control of the lac promoter in Escherichia coli induces the synthesis of a group of related proteins that were immunoreactive with pADPRT antibody and that had catalytic properties very similar to those of the human enzyme. Purification of this enzymatic activity was performed essentially as described for the human enzyme. The Km, pH optimum, optimal reaction temperature, and inhibition by 3-aminobenzamide and 3-methoxybenzamide were found to be similar for the recombinant and the human enzymes. The purified recombinant enzyme consists of two major proteins of Mr 99,000 and Mr 89,000. Both proteins show pADPRT activity in activity gel analysis with [32P]NAD+ as substrate. Microsequencing of these two proteins isolated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and deletion mutagenesis of the pADPRT expression plasmid shows that the Mr 99,000 and Mr 89,000 proteins derive from initiation of translation at internal translational start signals located within the pADPRT cDNA.\r"

Recombinant reverse transcriptase from human immunodeficiency virus, natural enzyme from avian myeloblastosis virus, and a known endonuclease, Escherichia coli ribonuclease H, cleaved relaxed, circular, covalently closed plasmids in which 770 consecutive residues of one strand were ribonucleotides. The avian enzyme also deadenylated capped globin mRNA with a covalently attached oligo(dT) tail at the 3' end. These results resolve a long-standing controversy--that the viral enzymes are obligatory exonucleases in vitro, based on their failure to cleave certain substrates for E. coli ribonuclease H, including circular poly(A).linear poly(T) and ribonucleotide-substituted supercoiled plasmids, but resemble endonucleases in vivo, based on their ability to degrade RNA in complex DNA.RNA hybrids. The data strongly suggest that the viral enzymes are endonucleases with exquisite sensitivity to the conformation of heteroduplexes. Inhibition of viral, but not cellular, ribonuclease H with ribonucleoside-vanadyl complexes further distinguishes these enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to human neutrophils causes a rapid increase in the basal and fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated Na+ influx and an increase in intracellular pH. The increase can be seen as early as 5 min after the addition of GM-CSF. Changes produced by GM-CSF are totally inhibited by amiloride and are significantly reduced in pertussis toxin-treated cells. The stimulation of the Na+/H+ exchange mechanism by GM-CSF inhibits further stimulation of this system with either fMet-Leu-Phe or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. In addition, membrane preparations isolated from GM-CSF-treated neutrophils have higher basal and stimulated GTPase activities. The basal and the fMet-Leu-Phe- or platelet-activating factor-stimulated GTPase activities are reduced in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Cells pretreated with GM-CSF accumulate more radioactive phosphate than control cells, and this increase is diminished by pertussis toxin treatment. In addition, GM-CSF causes a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of five proteins with molecular masses of 118 kDa, 92 kDa, 78 kDa, 54 kDa, and 40 kDa. These results clearly show that GM-CSF, on its own, can initiate several changes and that these changes are mediated in part by the pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.\r"

  ".W": "The level of mRNA encoding the transferrin receptor (TfR) is regulated by iron, and this regulation is mediated by a portion of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the TfR transcript. This portion of 3' UTR of the human TfR mRNA contains five RNA elements that have structural similarity to the iron-responsive element (IRE) found as a single copy in the 5' UTR of the mRNA for ferritin, whose translation is regulated by iron. Moreover, five very similar elements are also contained in the 3' UTR of the chicken TfR mRNA. Cytosolic extracts of human cell lines are shown by a gel shift assay involving RNase T1 protection to contain an IRE-binding protein capable of specific interaction with the human TfR 3' UTR. When the protecting protein is removed, the protected RNA can be digested with RNase T1 to yield oligoribonucleotide fragments characteristic of two of the IREs contained in the TfR 3' UTR. As judged by cross-competition experiments, the same IRE-binding protein interacts with the ferritin IRE. The apparent affinity of RNA sequence elements for the IRE-binding protein is shown to depend upon the sequence of the RNA. A comprehensive secondary structure for the regulatory region of the TfR mRNA is proposed based on the experimentally demonstrated presence of at least two IRE-like structural elements.\r"

Genomic and cDNA clones representing a homolog of the Drosophila dnc+ gene were isolated from rat libraries and characterized. This gene has been named ratdnc-1. One cDNA clone defines a large open reading frame of approximately 1.8 kilobases (kb), predicting a protein sequence of 610 amino acids with significant homology to a conserved domain of approximately 275 residues found in most other PDEases. The amino acid identity value to the Drosophila cAMP PDEase within this domain is a striking 75%. Other cDNA clones show blocks of sequence divergence from this cDNA clone close to the predicted N terminus, indicating the potential existence of a family of related enzymes encoded by alternatively spliced messenger RNAs from ratdnc-1. Genomic blotting experiments suggest the existence of at least one other rat gene with homology to ratdnc-1. RNAs homologous to ratdnc-1 are heterogeneous in size between tissues, with heart containing a major transcript of 4.4 kb and brain one of 4.0 kb. The potential identity of the product of the ratdnc-1 gene with known PDEases is discussed.\r"

Reconstitution experiments in which purified cGMP phosphodiesterase alone or with G protein were reassociated to the vesicles in proportions similar to those found in the native rod provide evidence for a direct interaction between the cGMP-dependent channel protein and the phosphodiesterase. (i) In its inhibited state, phosphodiesterase markedly stimulates the activity of the channels in the presence of cGMP (situation in the dark-adapted rod) but is not capable of activating the channels in the absence of cGMP. (ii) In the absence of cGMP, activation of the phosphodiesterase by G protein with GTP bound (equivalent to photoexcitation) induces the opening of cation channels that have the same conductance for sodium ions as cGMP-activated channels (20-22 pS, with two sublevels of about 7 pS and 13 pS).\r"

  ".W": "A method is described for genetic detection of mismatch repair products following transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method is based on the detection of beta-galactosidase activity in clonal derivatives of cells transformed with heteroduplex plasmid DNA. Heteroduplex plasmid substrates were constructed by insertion of an oligonucleotide heteroduplex into the coding sequence of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. The plasmid and oligonucleotides were designed so that one strand of the construct would code for a functional beta-galactosidase and the other strand would contain an in-frame nonsense codon. The frequencies of transformed clones containing only Lac+ cells, only Lac- cells, or a mixture of the two Lac phenotypes provided information on the efficiency of the repair reaction. With this method, plasmids carrying single-base substitution mismatches, a single-base frameshift mismatch (T/delta), or a 3-base-pair substitution mismatch (TGA/GAA) were tested. A/C, G/T, G/A, G/G, and T/delta mismatches were repaired with significantly greater efficiencies than C/C, A/A, T/T, and TGA/GAA. T/C was repaired with an intermediate efficiency. The frequencies of products obtained with G/G, G/A, and T/delta mismatches suggested modest inequality of repair in the two possible directions. Strains carrying the repair-deficient pms1-1 mutation were also tested. The efficiencies of repair of A/C, G/T, G/G, and A/A mismatches were reduced in pms1-1 cells compared with wild-type cells. In addition, a change in repair inequality was detected when transformation of the two strains with an A/C mismatch was compared.\r"

Mutant flies show transformations of the third and, to a lesser extent, first thoracic segment toward the second thoracic segment; abdominal transformations also occur. Prior genetic evidence suggested that these effects are based on interactions between trx and genes of the bithorax complex and Antennapedia complex. Further, interactions between the maternal effect locus female sterile homeotic (fsh) and trx have been observed. To aid in a molecular analysis of trx function, we have cloned the locus by a P-element transposon tagging approach. Five insertion mutations have been mapped within a region of about 10 kilobases; one of these mutations reverted coincident with the loss of the insertion. Transcription mapping suggests that two RNAs of about 12 and 15 kilobases are the major transcripts of the trx locus and that the transcription unit comprises a region of about 25 kilobases. Transcripts from the trx locus are distributed uniformly in early embryos, but at 14-16 hr after fertilization the ventral nerve cord contains a higher concentration of trx RNA than other regions of the embryo.\r"

Females exposed to long days (16 hr of light per day) at the same low temperature undergo ovarian maturation. The short day induced diapause continues for 6-7 weeks under a 10:14 light/dark cycle at 12 degrees C but is terminated rapidly after a transfer to higher temperature (18 or 25 degrees C) or to long days (18:6 light/dark cycle). Females from three strains homozygous for alleles of the period (per) locus, reportedly arrhythmic for behavioral circadian rhythms, and females that possessed two overlapping deletions of per were also capable of discriminating between long and short days, although, when compared with the wild-type flies, the critical day length was shifted to shorter values by approximately 2 hr. It is concluded that the period locus is not causally involved in photoperiod time measurement.\r"

  ".W": "We have used antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to genes encoding the variable (V) region of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains (V alpha and V beta) to control TCR expression in T-cell hybridomas. Two hybridomas, A1.1 and B1.1, recognize a synthetic polypeptide antigen designated poly 18 (poly[Glu-Tyr-Lys-(Glu-Tyr-Ala)5]) together with I-Ad. We have found that TCR function (production of lymphokines in response to antigen) and T3 expression were removed after protease treatment of the cells and were fully recovered 48 hr later. However, when antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the appropriate TCR V genes were present after protease treatment, little or no recovery of TCR function or T3 expression was observed. This effect was specific for the TCR V genes utilized by the T cell: antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the TCR V regions of A1.1 had no effect on TCR expression in B1.1 and vice versa. Thus, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides can be used to temporarily block expression of a TCR gene in a T-cell hybridoma. This technique was then applied to a paradoxical phenomenon in A1.1 cells. We had observed previously that A1.1 releases an antigen-specific immunoregulatory activity that shows the same antigenic fine specificity as is displayed by the TCR of A1.1. We now report that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the A1.1 V alpha gene blocked the production of this soluble antigen-specific activity by the cell. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to A1.1 V beta, on the other hand, had no effect on the production of this antigen-specific activity. We discuss these observations in the context of recent findings on the nature of T cell-derived antigen-specific regulatory factors.\r"

Forty-five distinctive allele profiles (electrophoretic types, ETs) were distinguished, among which mean genetic diversity per locus (H) was 0.424. Cluster analysis of a matrix of genetic distances between paired ETs revealed two primary phylogenetic divisions of the species separated at a distance of 0.54. ETs in division I were presented by strains of serotypes 4b, 1/2b, and 4a, whereas strains of ETs in division II were of serotypes 1/2a and 1/2c. Human and animal isolates did not represent distinctive subsets of ETs. The occurrence of linkage disequilibrium between enzyme loci and the widespread distribution of certain ETs indicate that the genetic structure of L. monocytogenes is clonal. One clone, marked by ET1, caused major epidemics of human disease in western Switzerland in the period 1983-1987 and in Los Angeles County, California, in 1985, both of which were attributed to contamination of soft cheese. ET 1 is closely related to the clone (ET7) that caused two large outbreaks of listeriosis in Massachusetts in 1979 and 1983.\r"

Lp(a) contains a unique structure, apolipoprotein (a), that shares partial homology with plasminogen. We now report that plasmin catalyzes the binding of Lp(a) to both immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin in a manner analogous to our previously reported studies with plasminogen. Plasmin treatment of immobilized fibrinogen induces a 3.7-fold increase in Lp(a) binding. Low density lipoprotein, molecules similar to Lp(a) but lacking apolipoprotein (a), bind poorly to immobilized fibrinogen and binding is not increased by plasmin. Trypsin but not neutrophil elastase also increases the binding of Lp(a) to fibrinogen. Lp(a) also complexes to plasmin-fibrinogen digests, and binding increases in proportion to the time of plasmin-induced fibrinogen degradation. Lp(a) binding is lysine-binding site dependent as it is inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Lp(a) inhibits the binding of plasminogen to plasmin-modified immobilized fibrinogen, indicating that both molecules compete for similar lysine-binding sites. These findings demonstrate an affinity between Lp(a) and protease-modified fibrinogen or fibrin and thereby provide a potential mechanism to explain the association between thrombosis, coronary atherosclerosis, and increased blood concentrations of Lp(a).\r"

  ".W": "Previous work by others on Limulus photoreceptors has shown that application of a variety of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) activators produces discrete waves of depolarization similar to those generated by single photos, but smaller in size. We investigated whether these events might originate at a site other than the G protein. Initiation of the events did not depend on the state of the visual pigment, suggesting that the events do not originate at the pigment level. The events could be blocked by the G-protein blocker guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate (GDP[betaS]) and thus support the conclusion that these discrete events are due to the activation of G protein itself. Quantitative measurements indicate that the average size of these events is approximately 8 times smaller than that evoked by single photons under the same conditions. Given certain reasonable assumptions, these results imply that the gain of the first stage of transduction in vivo is approximately 8, a value considerably lower than that measured in vitro in vertebrate rods (gain, 100-500). Furthermore, independent evidence for a low first-stage gain in Limulus is derived from the observation that GDP[betaS] barely affects the size of the response to single photons, but greatly reduces the probability that a photon evokes a response. These results can be explained if rhodopsin normally activates only a few G proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Melatonin receptors were identified and characterized in crude membrane preparations from lizard brain by using 125I-labeled melatonin (125I-Mel), a potent melatonin agonist. 125I-Mel binding sites were saturable; Scatchard analysis revealed high-affinity and lower affinity binding sites, with apparent Kd of 2.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(-11) M and 2.06 +/- 0.43 x 10(-10) M, respectively. Binding was reversible and inhibited by melatonin and closely related analogs but not by serotonin or norepinephrine. Treatment of crude membranes with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]), significantly reduced the number of high-affinity receptors and increased the dissociation rate of 125I-Mel from its receptor. Furthermore, GTP[gamma S] treatment of ligand-receptor complexes solubilized by Triton X-100 also led to a rapid dissociation of 125I-Mel from solubilized ligand-receptor complexes. Gel filtration chromatography of solubilized ligand-receptor complexes revealed two major peaks of radio-activity corresponding to Mr greater than 400,000 and Mr ca. 110,000. This elution profile was markedly altered by pretreatment with GTP[gamma S] before solubilization; only the Mr 110,000 peak was present in GTP[gamma S]-pretreated membranes. The results strongly suggest that 125I-Mel binding sites in lizard brain are melatonin receptors, with agonist-promoted guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) coupling and that the apparent molecular size of receptors uncoupled from G proteins is about 110,000.\r"

The increase in c-Fos mRNA and its translation product are early events (15 and 40 min, respectively) and precede the accumulation of NGF mRNA, which peaks at 3 hr. The increase in the two mRNAs appears interrelated because cycloheximide inhibits the accumulation of c-Fos protein and NGF mRNA elicited by isoproterenol. Moreover, the accumulation of nuclear c-Fos protein and NGF mRNA induced by BAR stimulation is reduced by 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of c-Fos mRNA induction. These data suggest that, in C6-2B astrocytoma cells, the nuclear accumulation of c-Fos protein is required for the induction of NGF mRNA expression by BAR stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility that glucocorticoids regulate specific guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) was investigated in rat cerebral cortex. Corticosterone was administered to normal and bilaterally adrenalectomized rats, and hormone regulation of individual G-protein subunits was investigated in cerebral cortex in three ways: (i) immunoblot analysis of subunit protein, (ii) hybridization blot analysis of subunit mRNA, and (iii) ADP-ribosylation analysis of stimulatory G protein (Gs alpha) subunits. Chronic (7 days) corticosterone administration to normal rats increased levels of Gs alpha immunoreactivity, mRNA, and ADP-ribosylation but decreased levels of inhibitory G protein (Gi alpha) mRNA and tended to decrease levels of Gi alpha immunoreactivity. In contrast, levels of Go alpha and G beta immunoreactivity and mRNA were not influenced by corticosterone treatment. In adrenalectomized rats, corticosterone treatment produced a 25-50% increase in the levels of Gs alpha immunoreactivity, mRNA, and ADP-ribosylation, whereas the hormone produced a 20-35% decrease in the levels of Gi alpha immunoreactivity and mRNA. Adrenalectomy, without corticosterone replacement, produced the opposite effects on Gs alpha and Gi alpha compared to sham-operated controls, indicating that these G proteins are regulated by this class of steroid hormone under physiological conditions in vivo. The results indicate that specific G-protein subunits--namely, Gs alpha and Gi alpha--are under the coordinated control of glucocorticoids in rat brain and demonstrate that G proteins are physiological targets of glucocorticoids in vivo. Possible roles played by these G-protein responses in mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on brain function are discussed.\r"

Because of their functional homologies with regulatory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, they are thought to be involved in the control of cellular proliferation as transducers of incoming growth signals. In an effort to identify proteins interacting with p21ras, we have used in vivo crosslinking techniques on Rat-1 fibroblasts and derived cell lines overexpressing p21ras and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-p21ras antibodies. Under those conditions, using the homobifunctional crosslinker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), a protein of Mr 60,000 (p60) is found to be associated with p21ras, and this association is enhanced by the treatment of quiescent cells with serum. Upon sedimentation of detergent extracts from crosslinked cells on sucrose gradients, a p21-p60 complex could be demonstrated with a Mr of 200,000-300,000, p60 does not appear to be related to pp60src nor to the cytosolic GTPase activating protein that interacts with p21ras to enhance its GTPase activity. The amount of p60 seems to be limiting relative to p21ras in fibroblasts, since similar levels of p60 are immunoprecipitated from Rat-1 cells and transfectants overexpressing Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras p21s; the same protein is also found to associate with p21ras in numerous mammalian cell lines. The relevance of this component to the role of ras proteins in signal transduction is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "N2O reductase (N2O----N2) is the terminal enzyme in the energy-conserving denitrification pathway of soil and marine denitrifying bacteria. The protein is composed of two identical subunits and contains eight copper ions per enzyme molecule. The magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of resting (oxidized) N2O reductase is strikingly similar to the magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of the CuA site in mammalian cytochrome c oxidase [Greenwood, C., Hull, B. C., Barber, D., Eglinton, D. G. & Thomson, A. J. (1983) Biochem. J. 215, 303-316] and is unlike the magnetic circular dichroism spectra of all other biological copper chromophores obtained to date. Sulfur (or chlorine) scatterers are required to fit the copper extended x-ray absorption fine structure data of both the oxidized and reduced forms of N2O reductase. Satisfactory fits require a Cu-N or Cu-O [denoted Cu-(N, O)] interaction at 2.0 A, a Cu-(S, Cl) interaction at 2.3 A and an additional Cu(S, Cl) interaction at approximately 2.6 A (oxidized) or approximately 2.7 A (reduced). Approximately eight sulfur ions (per eight copper ions) at approximately 2.3 A are required to fit the extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for both the oxidized and reduced N2O reductase. The 2.3-A Cu-(S, Cl) distance is nearly identical to that previously determined for the CuA site in cytochrome c oxidase. A 2.6-2.7 A Cu-(S, Cl) interaction is also present in resting and fully reduced cytochrome c oxidase. Comparison of the N2O reductase sequence, determined by translating the structural NosZ gene, with cytochrome c oxidase subunit II sequences from several sources indicates that a Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-His stretch is highly conserved. This sequence contains three of the probable ligands (two cysteines and one histidine) in a CuA-type site. Collectively these data establish that Pseudomonas stutzeri N2O reductase contains CuA-type sites.\r"

In all cases studied the translocation splits the TCR delta chain locus. Somatic cell hybrids containing the human 10q+ chromosome resulting from the translocation retain the human terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene mapped at 10q23-q24 and the diversity and joining, D delta 2-J delta 1, regions of the TCR delta chain, but not the V alpha region (variable region of the TCR alpha chain), demonstrating that the split occurred within the V alpha-D delta 2 region. Molecular cloning of the breakpoint junctions revealed that the TCR delta chain sequences involved are made from the D delta 2 segment. The chromosome breakpoints are clustered within a region of approximately 263 base pairs of chromosome 10. The results suggest that the translocation of the TCR delta chain locus to a locus on 10q, which we have designated TCL3, results in deregulation of this putative oncogene, leading to acute T-cell leukemia.\r"

Tissue-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites were found within the 5' promoter region and a region 3' of the gene essential for gene expression. DNase I hypersensitivity of the 5' region correlated strictly with transcriptional activity, whereas hypersensitivity of the 3' region correlated with T-cell progenitor activity or lineage commitment but not necessarily with transcription. Hha I and Hpa II sites around the 5' and 3' regions were undermethylated in CD2-expressing T cells but were more extensively methylated in other cell types. These results define likely regulatory elements both upstream and downstream of the CD2 gene that control its tissue-specific expression. Further, they show that the 3' regulatory region adopts an open chromatin configuration prior to lineage commitment and during early stages of T-cell development before the CD2 gene is transcribed.\r"

Their expression is developmentally controlled and normally restricted to certain cell types. This control is mediated by cis-acting sequences in class II promoters and by trans-acting regulatory factors. Several nuclear proteins bind to class II promoter sequences. In a form of hereditary immunodeficiency characterized by a defect in a trans-acting regulatory factor controlling class II gene transcription, we have observed that one of these nuclear factors (RF-X) does not bind to its target sequence (the class II X box). A cDNA encoding RF-X was isolated by screening a phage expression library with an X-box binding-site probe. The recombinant protein has the binding specificity of RF-X, including a characteristic gradient of affinity for the X boxes of HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ promoters. RF-X mRNA is present in the regulatory mutants, indicating a defect in the synthesis of a functional form of the RF-X protein.\r"

In the present study, we demonstrate that TSST-1 binds with saturation kinetics and with a dissociation constant of 17-43 nM to a single class of binding sites on human mononuclear cells. There was a strong correlation between the number of TSST-1 binding sites and the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and interferon-gamma induced the expression of class II molecules as well as TSST-1 binding sites on human skin-derived fibroblasts. Monoclonal antibodies to HLA-DR, but not to HLA-DP or HLA-DQ, strongly inhibited TSST-1 binding. Affinity chromatography of 125I-labeled cell membranes over TSST-1-agarose resulted in the recovery of two bands of 35 kDa and 31 kDa that comigrated, respectively, with the alpha and beta chains of HLA-DR and that could be immunoprecipitated with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies. Binding of TSST-1 was demonstrated to HLA-DR and HLA-DQ L-cell transfectants. These results indicate that major histocompatibility complex class II molecules represent the major binding site for TSST-1 on human cells.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia chromosome associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been linked to a hybrid BCR/ABL protein product that differs from that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This implies that the molecular structures of the two chromosomal translocations also differ. Localization of translocation breakpoints in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL has been impeded due to the only partial characterization of the BCR locus. We have isolated the entire 130-kilobase BCR genomic locus from a human cosmid library. A series of five single-copy genomic probes from the 70-kilobase first intron of BCR were used to localize rearrangements in 8 of 10 Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALLs. We have demonstrated that these breakpoints are all located at the 3' end of the intron around an unusual restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by deletion of a 1-kilobase fragment containing Alu family reiterated sequences. This clustering is unexpected in light of previous theories of rearrangement in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia that would have predicted a random dispersion of breakpoints in the first intron in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. The proximity of the translocation breakpoints to this constitutive deletion may indicate shared mechanisms of rearrangement or that such polymorphisms mark areas of the genome prone to recombination.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome results in a fusion of portions of the BCR gene from chromosome 22 and the ABL gene from chromosome 9, producing a chimeric BCR-ABL mRNA and protein. In lymphoblastic leukemias, there are two molecular subtypes of the Ph1 chromosome, one with a rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of the BCR gene, producing the same 8.5-kilobase BCR-ABL fusion mRNA seen in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and the other, without a bcr rearrangement, producing a 7.0-kilobase BCR-ABL fusion mRNA that is seen only in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We studied the molecular subtype of the Ph1 chromosome in 11 cases of Ph1-positive ALL, including 2 with a previous diagnosis of CML, using a sensitive method to analyze the mRNA species based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We observed unexpected heterogeneity in BCR-ABL mRNA in this population; in particular, 1 of 6 bcr-rearranged cases and 1 of 5 bcr-unrearranged cases contained none of the known fusion mRNA species, while 1 of the bcr-rearranged cases contained both. This latter case is particularly interesting because it suggests that the acquisition of an additional BCR-ABL fusion species may be a mechanism of disease progression. We conclude that the PCR gives additional information about the Ph1 chromosome gene products that cannot be obtained by genomic analysis, but that it cannot be used as the sole means of detection of this chromosomal abnormality in ALL because of the high incidence of false negative results.\r"

Using this method, the molecular defect responsible for mild hemophilia A has been identified for a patient whose plasma factor VIII activity is 0.05 unit/ml, even though the factor VIII antigen content is 3.25 units/ml. Although the variant factor VIII has an apparently normal molecular mass and chain composition, the 92-kDa heavy chain accumulates when the variant protein is incubated with thrombin and the 44-kDa heavy chain fragment cannot be detected. In contrast, thrombin cleavage of the 80-kDa light chain to the 72-kDa fragment is normal. As these data indicate a loss of factor VIII cleavage by thrombin at arginine-372, the genetic defect was determined by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification of exon 8 of the factor VIII gene and direct sequencing of the amplified product. A single-base substitution (guanine----adenine) was identified that produces an arginine to histidine substitution at amino acid residue 372. These data identify the molecular basis of an abnormal factor VIII, \"factor VIII-Kumamoto,\" that lacks procoagulant function because of impaired thrombin activation.\r"

  ".U": "89264603\r", 
  ".W": "The selective destruction of the pancreatic islet beta cells in type 1 diabetes mellitus is thought to be mediated by a cellular autoimmune process, possibly triggered by virus infection in genetically susceptible individuals. Because of the potentially important role of cell-cell adhesion in the immune response, we investigated whether cytokine products of mononuclear cells, or virus infection, induced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on human endocrine islet cells. By flow cytofluorimetry, control islet cells did not express detectable ICAM-1. However, after a 72-hr exposure of islets to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (each at 250 units/ml), ICAM-1 was induced on greater than 85% of islet cells. IFN-gamma was 50% more potent than TNF-alpha; together, their effects were additive. Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein expression, detected on control islet cells, was also stimulated by IFN-gamma and/or TNF-alpha. In contrast, infection with reovirus type 3 did not induce ICAM-1 on islet cells, although it stimulated the expression of class I MHC proteins. By double-label indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, ICAM-1 expression was identified on both beta (insulin-secreting) and delta (somatostatin-secreting) islet cells. Monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 precipitated protein of Mr 97,000 from [35S]methionine-labeled islets exposed to IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but not from control islets. RNA blot analysis revealed a major species of 3.3 kilobases and a minor species of 2.2 kilobases induced in islets exposed to the cytokines. These findings have implications for the molecular mechanisms of beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes, in that expression of ICAM-1 by beta cells may facilitate adhesion of antigen-targeted immune cells.\r"

A 1.7-kilobase cDNA has been identified and characterized from Drosophila that codes for a protein 71% identical to bovine Gs alpha. The similarity is most striking in the regions thought to be responsible for the interactions with receptors and effectors, suggesting that the basic components of this signal-transduction pathway have been conserved through evolution. RNA blot hybridization and DNA sequence analysis suggest that a single transcript, expressed predominantly in the head, is present in Drosophila. In situ hybridization studies indicate that the Drosophila Gs alpha transcript is localized primarily in the cells of the central nervous system and in the eyes.\r"

However, only 54 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists and 68 percent of general practitioners provided sigmoidoscopy, 70 percent of obstetrician-gynecologists provided stool guaiac slide tests, 74 percent of general practitioners provided breast self-exam instruction, and 79 percent of internists provided Pap tests. Physicians were asked what screening intervals they recommended for each test for asymptomatic elderly patients. These reports were compared with current American Cancer Society (ACS) recommendations. Large proportions of physicians in four specialties recommended sigmoidoscopy and mammography less often than the ACS recommended. More than 20 percent of physicians in the four specialties believed the elderly do not need routine sigmoidoscopy. Most physicians (90 percent or more) recommended Papanicolaou tests more often than the ACS recommended. Specialty and young physician age were the best predictors of physicians' overall adherence to ACS recommendations for cancer screening schedules.\r"

Although the effectiveness of such programs is still being discussed by policy makers, the number of preventive health programs for the elderly is increasing. One of the oldest and largest preventive health programs for the elderly in the United States, the California Preventive Health Care for the Aging Program (PHCAP) is analyzed. The typical PHCAP participant was white, female, between 70 and 79 years of age, and living in an urban area. More than half (59 percent) of the PHCAP participants had some kind of private medical insurance in addition to Medicare coverage. Seventy-seven percent of the participants had seen a physician within the previous year. The most frequently reported chronic conditions were arthritis (31 percent), hypertension (24 percent), cardiovascular problems (13 percent), and vision and hearing problems (18 and 11 percent). Twenty-seven percent of the population were hypertensive; 7 percent of these had moderate to severe hypertension. Eighty percent of the participants were identified as having at least one problem; 40 percent were referred to a physician. Frequently, public health programs need to be evaluated without the benefit of a controlled trial design. This analysis of a statewide preventive health care program for the aging, PHCAP, shows the program's effectiveness in detecting a large number of health problems and making extensive referrals to other health professionals, particularly physicians. These findings should be useful to health practitioners and policy makers developing similar statewide programs for the elderly.\r"

Using longitudinal data sets and new methodological techniques, researchers have begun to assess active life expectancies, estimating not only how long a subpopulation can expect to live beyond each age, but what fractions of the expected remaining lifetime will be lived as independent, dependent, or institutionalized. New ideas are addressed, applying recently developed multistate life table methods to Waves One and Two of the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study. Expectations of active life are presented for those 65 and older who initially are in one of two functional states of well-being. Included are expectations of life, for those, for example, who were independent and remained so, or those who were dependent and became independent. Although public health officials are concerned about the number of elderly who cease being independent, preliminary analysis shows that a significant number of the dependent elderly regain their independence, a situation which needs to be addressed in health care planning.\r"

Despite the offer of incentives, only 27 percent attended AIDS education and only 12 percent obtained voluntary HIV antibody (ab) testing. However, AIDS education was attended by proportionately more of those who were at highest risk for AIDS because of current intravenous drug use. The availability of HIV-ab testing neither encouraged nor discouraged participation in AIDS education. Patients who were relatively more likely to choose HIV-ab testing were older, had been or were married, had plans to have children, believed the test to be useful, and believed that their counselors support their decision to be tested. Those who declined to be tested were reluctant to confront the emotional aspects of their risk status, were concerned about possible breaches of confidentiality, and doubted the value of testing. The implications of the findings for implementing AIDS prevention measures in methadone programs are discussed. Programs need either to require attendance at AIDS education or give patients an incentive to attend. HIV-ab testing should be available but should remain voluntary. A stronger medical rationale for testing is developing and may increase future participation. Methadone programs must continue to engage patients actively in AIDS risk reduction efforts.\r"

Colon cancer among men was significantly low, but incidence among women was similar to that expected. Lung cancer incidence was lower than expected for both sexes. Ovarian cancer rates were not different from expected rates. At sites not previously related to asbestos exposure, cancer of the oral cavity was significantly high, with most affected persons having a history of cigarette smoking.

Three of the experiments also compared two or more Reflotrons to assess intermachine reliability. The Reflotron analyzer provided precise blood cholesterol measurements both in repeated tests and among instruments. The accuracy of the method varied across reagent lots, with an average negative bias of 21.05 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl), decreasing steadily to a negative bias of 4.07 mg per dl. Reliability between and within analyzers was high. The data provide support for the use of the instrument in blood cholesterol screening efforts, yet signal the need for attention to quality control procedures, both by the manufacturer and operators, to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results.\r"

  ".W": "The health status of Indian teenagers in the United States is below that of the general population. The usual barriers to the use of health care services that young people, including young Indians, encounter are compounded in rural areas by distance, isolation, and lack of appropriate services. To overcome these barriers in rural New Mexico, a public health demonstration project (a) established a single location where adolescents can receive multiple, integrated health care services free of charge; (b) set up the initial program of services at a rural school; (c) established links with existing agencies; and (d) incorporated community action toward creating change. The project began as a joint effort of three communities, the University of New Mexico (UNM), and the Albuquerque Area Indian Health Service (IHS) of the Public Health Service; a secondary level public school soon became a participant. The project is being replicated in two other communities that have formed separate partnerships with UNM and the area IHS; also the New Mexico Health and Environment Department has joined the effort in one community. Preliminary data suggest that the services are being used by a majority of the target population, with the proportions of boys and girls about equal.\r"

  ".W": "The determination of years of potential life lost (YPLL) can aid in monitoring changes in premature mortality among various population groups. While premature mortality has been shown to differ among blacks and whites, patterns of YPLL have not been well established among other racial groups. The Seneca Nation of Indians (SNI) is a Native American group residing primarily in western New York State (NYS). A review of SNI necrology records revealed that 55 percent (510 of 924) of the deaths between 1955 and 1984 occurred before 65 years of age. The proportion of premature deaths among males exceeded the proportion in females. SNI males demonstrated an increased risk of premature death (odds ratio = 1.43) relative to SNI females. Both the percentage of premature deaths and the number of YPLL per death were greater among SNI members compared with NYS residents. Almost one-half of all YPLL among the SNI were attributable to accidents and injuries. Heart disease, digestive diseases, and malignant neoplasms also represented important contributors to YPLL for both SNI males and females. This investigation identifies important causes of premature death among a Native American population and underscores the preventable nature of premature loss of life.\r"

At the same time, the demands for family physicians appear to be strong, partially because case-management systems recognize the cost-effectiveness and appropriate training of family physicians for their needs. The largest factor inhibiting the supply of such physicians appears to be the relatively lower income of family practice compared to other specialty fields. This creates more difficulties in funding training positions and may limit the attractiveness of the field to medical school graduates.\r"

The victims were generally children (N = 11), the elderly (N = 13), or intoxicated adults (N = 9). Supervision of the child was inadequate in 64 percent of the children's deaths. The driver was at fault in deaths of seven children, five adults, and three elderly persons. None of the children and only one of the elderly victims was injured at night. The majority of injuries occurred on major thorough-fares; only 16 percent occurred on residential streets. Possible strategies for prevention appear to include improved enforcement of pedestrian right-of-way laws, changes in vehicle design, modification of the environment (particularly in urban areas), and improved training programs for children.\r"

Data were obtained on all suicides of Maryland residents, regardless of where the deaths occurred. Univariate analysis showed that the relationships between suicide and age, race, sex, and marital status are consistent with those in the literature. No significant relationship appeared to exist between the month of death and suicide. During multivariate analysis, the discriminant function correctly predicted 80 percent of all the deaths, 74 percent of suicides, and 80 percent of all other causes, in their respective categories.\r"

Other research has suggested that length of participation in the program during pregnancy is associated with increased birth weight. The data were adjusted for various personal and local operational factors, such as prior WIC participation, race, age, income, household size, WIC priority level, availability of prenatal or other health services, targeted outreach policies, years of local operation, and local agency size. Previous participation in the WIC Program was the only factor significantly associated with early enrollment (adjusted odds ratio 2.1). Race was marginally significant. Neither the presence of local policies of outreach targeted to pregnant women, nor co-location of WIC services with prenatal or other health services, showed significant effects on early enrollment.\r"

An olfactory-specific guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein alpha subunit has now been characterized and evidence is presented suggesting that this G protein, termed Golf, mediates olfaction. Messenger RNA that encodes Golf alpha is expressed in olfactory neuroephithelium but not in six other tissues tested. Moreover, within the olfactory epithelium, Golf alpha appears to be expressed only by the sensory neurons. Specific antisera were used to localize Golf alpha protein to the sensory apparatus of the receptor neurons. Golf alpha shares extensive amino acid identity (88 percent) with the stimulatory G protein, Gs alpha. The expression of Golf alpha in S49 cyc- kin- cells, a line deficient in endogenous stimulatory G proteins, demonstrates its capacity to stimulate adenylate cyclase in a heterologous system.\r"

In cardiac muscle, in contrast, the similarity of the voltage dependence of developed tension and intracellular calcium transients to that of calcium current suggests that the calcium current may gate the release of calcium. Nevertheless, a mechanism similar to that of skeletal muscle continues to be postulated for cardiac muscle. By using rapid exchange (20 to 50 milliseconds) of the extracellular solutions in rat ventricular myocytes in which the intracellular calcium transients or cell shortening were measured, it has now been shown that the influx of calcium through the calcium channel is a mandatory link in the processes that couple membrane depolarization to the release of calcium. Thus, intramembrane charge movement does not contribute to the release of calcium in heart muscle.\r"

This discrepancy is addressed and resolved in a nitrogen-15 NMR study of the enzyme in the crystalline state. The results show that the His-Ser and Asp-His interactions are identical in crystals and solutions, but that in crystals His57 titrates with a pKa of 7.9, nearly one pKa unit higher than in solution. This elevated pKa accounts for the absence of the His-Ser hydrogen bond in previous x-ray studies.\r"

The identification of two NF1 patients with balanced translocations that involved chromosome 17q11.2 suggests that the disease can arise by gross rearrangement of the NF1 locus, and that the NF1 gene might be identified by cloning the region around these translocation breakpoints. To further define the region of these translocations, a series of chromosome 17 Not I-linking clones has been mapped to proximal 17q and studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. One clone, 17L1 (D17S133), clearly identifies the breakpoint in an NF1 patient with a t(1;17) translocation. A 2.3-megabase pulsed-field map of this region was constructed and indicates that the NF1 breakpoint is only 10 to 240 kilobases away from 17L1. This finding prepares the way for the cloning of NF1.\r"

The assay is based on expression of the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene flanked by Leptomonas DNA fragments that are likely to contain necessary elements for gene expression in trypanosomes. After electroporation of cells in the presence of plasmid DNA, CAT activity was detected in crude cell lysates. No activity was detected when the orientation of the L. seymouri mini-exon sequence (placed upstream of the CAT gene) was reversed, or in additional control experiments. This system provides a method for defining transcriptional control elements in trypanosomes.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical treatment for carcinoma of the hilar bile duct has been a challenging problem, because the five year survival rate is less than 5 per cent and the mean survival period is 17 to 24 months even in curatively resected instances. The prognostic factors of carcinoma of the hilar bile duct are remnant carcinoma at the bile duct stump and cancerous invasion into the lymphatics, veins, perineural spaces around the intrahepatic bile duct and caudate lobe of the liver. Based on these data, a new strategy for treatment of carcinoma of the hilar bile duct has been developed and applied clinically. The strategy consists of three procedures. The first is resection of the hilar bile duct with portajejunostomy; the second, specific anticancer therapy with mitomycin C (4 milligrams) adsorbed to the activated charcoal (MMC-CH) focused on the invasion of carcinoma to the periductal lymphatics, and third, intracavitary irradiation (32 to 40 gray) by 60Co using the remote after loading system (RALSTRON 20B, Shimazu Co. Ltd., Tokyo) through the bile duct focused on the periductal infiltration of the carcinoma and through the inferior vena cava focused on the caudate lobe of the liver. In this article, the operative procedures and theoretic background of the specific chemotherapy and irradiation are described. Seven patients have been treated using this regimen. Follow-up study ranged from seven to 38 months. All patients are alive, and five of seven are disease-free.\r"

Private long-term care insurance is unlikely to solve the problem of nursing home financing. Rationalizing public expenditures will hinge critically on greater clarity as to just what roles nursing homes are expected to fulfill in the system of care, especially how they are supposed to relate to other services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.\r"

The drug represents the first synthetic, orally active prostaglandin evaluated for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Clinical studies reveal a trend toward slightly lower healing rates with misoprostol when compared with histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. In addition, misoprostol was less effective than H2-blockers in reducing ulcer pain, and caused a higher incidence of adverse reactions, particularly diarrhea occurring in up to 13 percent of the patients treated. Several studies have shown misoprostol to be superior to cimetidine and sucralfate in the prevention of alcohol- and drug-induced gastritis. This report summarizes the biopharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of misoprostol in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and in the prevention of mucosal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Since its inception, the field of parenteral nutrition has continued to evolve requiring the expertise of several health care disciplines. This feature has made nutrition support unique among clinical subspecialties. As a member of this team, the pharmacist plays a critical role in the provision of sterile admixtures, compatible nutritional formulations, and cost-effective, therapeutically equivalent strategies. The pharmacist has become more involved in the clinical care of the patient, with particular emphasis on the development of drug-induced metabolic disorders. The multitude of drugs prescribed to hospitalized patients increases the potential for serious metabolic disturbances. This is especially true in the critical care setting where sudden changes in metabolism (e.g., acid-base homeostasis, fluid and electrolyte balance) may result in profoundly negative effects. The critical care setting also represents the most sensitive period of hospitalization where even subtle changes in metabolic homeostasis may assume major clinical significance. Early recognition of offending agents and the institution of appropriate intervention may avert serious iatrogenic diseases. The nutrition support team is in a unique position to address many such disorders through selective manipulation of the various components in the parenteral nutrient admixture. The ability of the pharmacist to recognize the development of drug-induced metabolic disorders lends further support for clinical pharmacy in nutrition support services.\r"

  ".W": "The critically ill, stressed patient has been characterized as having altered cellular metabolism. Altered protein metabolism is manifested as negative nitrogen balance, reduced whole-body protein synthesis, and increased proteolysis. An increased oxidation of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine has also been observed. Exogenous administration of BCAA as part of a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimen has been proposed to compensate for the altered protein metabolism in the stressed patient by sparing endogenous sources of BCAA, thereby reducing skeletal muscle catabolism and increasing protein synthesis. Numerous clinical studies have been performed investigating this theory. The results are controversial. Differences in study outcomes appear to be related to study design, especially patient selection. Our review of those studies which were randomized, prospective, and controlled indicates that an improvement in nitrogen retention and visceral protein status can be achieved in stress-stratified patients who receive a TPN regimen containing a BCAA-enriched formula. The significance of these outcomes on morbidity, length of hospital stay, and mortality has not been evaluated.\r"

  ".W": "Encainide and flecainide are two recently released class IC antiarrhythmic agents that have been reported to be highly effective for suppressing all forms of ventricular arrhythmias. Both drugs are potent blockers of the sodium channel and produce marked slowing of conduction within the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. To establish if the response to one agent predicts the response to the other, the antiarrhythmic effect of the two drugs was compared in a group of 18 patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmia. Fourteen patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia and four patients had ventricular fibrillation. The average ejection fraction of this group was 37%. All patients had a high density of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia and were evaluated noninvasively. Both drugs significantly reduced all forms of spontaneous arrhythmia. By Holter monitoring criteria, the effect of the two drugs was concordant in 61% (p = NS). By exercise criteria, the concordance rate was 50% (p = NS). Overall, 12 patients (67%) responded to encainide and eight (44%) patients responded to flecainide (p = NS). Only 10 of 18 (56%) patients had the same response to both agents (p = NS). There was no significant difference in ejection fraction or in average daily dose of drug between responders and nonresponders. Thus despite their similar electrophysiologic profile, the clinical antiarrhythmic effect of these two agents was different. For the noninvasive management of patients the response to one agent should not be used to predict the response to the other.\r"

Antiarrhythmic response was evaluated at 3 days and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The mean follow-up was 25 +/- 14 months (range 3 to 52). Four patients (19%) were excluded from efficacy analysis because of spontaneous decrease in baseline arrhythmia observed after 12 months of therapy. Effective arrhythmia suppression at both Holter monitoring and during exercise stress testing was maintained in 14 of 17 patients (82%). Mean frequency of premature ventricular contractions remained reduced by more than 95% throughout the follow-up. Five patients discontinued therapy between 3 and 18 months because of drug ineffectiveness (three patients, 18%) or side effects (two patients, 12%). In 12 patients (71%) long-term efficacy and tolerance were demonstrated. In no case was aggravation of arrhythmia or adverse cardiac effects observed. Side effects (5% to 29% of patients during follow-up) were usually minor and easily abolished by dosage reduction.

Blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma concentration of ANP were obtained at intervals of 4 hours beginning immediately after midnight. In the CHF group, plasma ANP concentrations at the time of blood sampling were all higher than those in the control group. Patients with severe CHF had higher plasma ANP concentrations than those in patients with less severe CHF. Plasma ANP concentration in the control group was highest at 4:00 AM and was lowest at 4:00 PM. The percent change of ANP secretion (% delta ANP): [(ANP at 4:00 AM-ANP at 4:00 PM)/ANP at 4:00 PM] x 100%, increased in the control group, while it decreased in the CHF group. Moreover, % delta ANP was much lower in patients with severe CHF than it was in patients with less severe CHF. There was a possible relation between the severity of CHF and the increase of ANP secretion associated with the relative diminution of nocturnal ANP secretion. Thus the present data imply that the diurnal change in ANP was lost in patients with CHF.\r"

For those patients receiving thrombolysis, early arrival was associated with increased survival (p = 0.031) after adjustment by Cox regression analysis for important clinical predictors of long-term survival. These covariates included pulmonary edema, anterior wall acute myocardial infarction, hypotension and absence of chest pain at hospital arrival. Reductions in barriers to timely administration of thrombolytic therapy can be achieved and can result in improved survival.\r"

The time to return to work was reduced from 75 days in usual care patients to 51 days in intervention patients (p less than 0.002). Significant differences were found between groups for medical costs and occupational income during follow-up. Total medical costs per patient were lower in the intervention patients than in the usual care patients in the 6 months after AMI ($2,970 vs $3,472). Occupational income per patient was higher in intervention patients than in the usual care group in the 6 months after AMI ($9,655 vs $7,553). The per capita benefit accounting for medical costs and occupational income was $6,685 for intervention patients and $4,081 for usual care patients. Projected to the greater than 300,000 low risk, employed survivors of AMI annually in this country, the savings generated by the Occupational Work Evaluation could yield an annual economic benefit greater than 800 million dollars.\r"

  ".W": "The acute hemodynamic and humoral responses to intravenous dilevalol (10 to 390 mg) were evaluated in 10 patients with moderate hypertension. Dilevalol, in doses of 30 mg or more, decreased arterial pressure (p less than 0.0001) through a decrease in total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.0001) associated with an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output (p less than 0.0001). Heart rate increased moderately at doses above 190 mg. Plasma norepinephrine levels increased (p less than 0.05), but epinephrine levels remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity and level of atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The hypotensive and humoral changes persisted 3 hours after the last dose. Dilevalol modified the pattern of hemodynamic response to isometric stress, slightly enhancing the increases in peripheral resistance and blunting increases in cardiac output and heart rate. The response in arterial pressure during administration of dilevalol remained similar to that seen in the pretreatment phase. The results show that dilevalol, when given intravenously in a dose of 30 to 90 mg, reduces arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without acceleration in heart rate. On the basis of these hemodynamic effects, dilevalol should be further evaluated for treatment of hypertensive emergencies.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicating coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has previously been based on concordance of electrocardiographic, enzymatic and scintigraphic criteria. Technetium-99m pyrophosphate (Tc-PPi) single-photon emission computed tomography now enables detection of AMI with high sensitivity and specificity. Using this technique, perioperative AMI was detected in 12 of 58 patients (21%) undergoing successful elective CABG for stable angina pectoris. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the predictive value of preoperative (New York Heart Association class, left ventricular ejection fraction and use of beta blockers) and intraoperative (number of grafts constructed, use of internal mammary anastomoses, use of sequential saphenous vein grafts, smallest grafted distal vessel lumen caliber and aortic cross-clamp time) variables. Preoperative New York Association class (p = 0.04) and smallest grafted distal vessel lumen caliber (p = 0.03) were significant multivariate predictors of perioperative AMI. Only 1 perioperative patient with AMI (and 1 pyrophosphate-negative patient) developed new Q waves. Serum creatine kinase-MB was higher in patients with AMI by repeated measures analysis of variance (p = 0.0003). Five AMIs occurred in myocardial segments revascularized using sequential saphenous vein grafts, and 7 in segments perfused by significantly stenosed epicardial vessels with distal lumen diameter and perfusion territory considered too small to warrant CABG. At 6-month follow-up, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 0.61 to 0.65 in Tc-PPI-negative patients (p = 0.01), but not in perioperative patients with AMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Increased concentrations of the fast-acting tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) inhibitor attenuate the fibrinolytic activity of pharmacologically administered activators of the fibrinolytic system such as t-PA. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that augmentation of synthesis and elaboration of inhibitor from the liver, leading to increased concentrations of inhibitor in plasma, or from endothelial cells in the vicinity of thrombi undergoing lysis, leading to increased concentrations locally, may contribute to failure of pharmacologically induced thrombolysis or to early reocclusion. Because platelets are rich in transforming growth factor beta and epidermal growth factor-like activity, it was thought that release of growth factors from platelets activated in vivo could mediate increases of the inhibitor in plasma by stimulating its formation in the liver and its local release from endothelial cells in the vicinity of thrombi. If so, fibrinolysis might be rendered more effective by concomitant prevention of platelet growth factor release. Transforming growth factor beta, a major constituent of platelets, increased concentrations of the t-PA inhibitor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in human hepatoma cells in a specific and dose-dependent manner. A peak effect was seen with 5 ng/ml and a 10-fold increase in 6 hours. Release of inhibitor protein into conditioned media increased as well. Induction of the inhibitor mRNA increase was elicited by exposure as brief as 30 minutes. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was not inhibitory. The mechanisms responsible differed from those seen with epidermal growth factor, shown previously in the laboratory to increase inhibitor mRNA. In addition, the 2 factors were synergistic. Platelet lysates elicited effects simulating those of the purified growth factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a 5 x 5 Latin square design, hourly breath hydrogen excretion (BHE) was measured for 5 h after the subjects consumed the above products (18 g lactose in each except HLM, which had 5 g). Mean BHE (ppm) for Y, SAM, LT, HLM, and WM were 12, 37, 29, 18, and 33, respectively. There was a significant (p less than 0.05) positive correlation of 0.808 between the symptoms reported and the mean peak BHE. However, the correlation between the symptoms and diagnosis by history was not significant. Although Y was as effective as HLM in minimizing lactose maldigestion, it was the least accepted by the subjects in sensory evaluations. Results of this study also indicate that microbial endogenous lactase in yogurt is superior to exogenous commercial lactase in alleviating lactose maldigestion.\r"

With the exception of mature B-cell disorders, it is difficult to demonstrate clonality by immunophenotypic studies. The advent of specific DNA probes for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes has greatly facilitated the detection of clonality and, to a lesser degree, lineage, in these cases. The authors have evaluated the diagnostic utility of these probes and compared them with standard immunophenotyping in 65 patients with a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders. Their results show a significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between lineage assignment as determined by phenotyping and gene rearrangement studies, with the latter far superior in determining clonality. Furthermore, analysis of gene rearrangements facilitated the documentation of lineage and/or clonality in six cases in which standard techniques had failed. Although the scientific basis of the study of gene rearrangements has been well established, the authors wish to emphasize the role that these techniques have in evaluating problem cases in the routine diagnostic laboratory.\r"

Defective platelet aggregation with one or more inducers was seen in 62% of all patients. An epinephrine-induced defect was the most consistent aggregation abnormality. Hyperaggregation and spontaneous aggregation were seen in 15% of patients. Of the eight patients who showed increased bleeding tendency, all eight showed defective aggregation with two or more inducers, five showed decreased surface activation response, as well as decreased or abnormal granules and dense tubular disarray in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) study. Seven patients had clinical evidence of recurrent arterial and venous thromboses. Five of these patients showed hyperaggregation response to adenosine diphosphate and collagen and abnormal Wu and Hoak platelet aggregate ratio. Four patients showed spontaneous aggregation on aggregometer. Surface activation response was significantly increased in five patients, and an increase in platelet granules by TEM study was seen in four patients. Primary thrombocythemia could be differentiated from secondary thrombocytosis (ST) by the presence of abnormal aggregation response and significantly increased PF4 and BTG in the former, and greatly elevated plasma fibrinogen and Factor VIII, as part of acute phase reactant response, in the latter.\r"

Clinical manifestations of NF-1 include cafe au lait spots (97%), freckling in the axillary or inguinal region (81%), Lisch nodules (30%), neurofibromas (15%), pseudoarthrosis (6%), and optic nerve gliomas (4%). More than minimal diagnostic criteria were met by 80% of the children who had a positive family history and by 32% of those who did not.

Initiation of interferon therapy was followed by a prompt and marked decrease in serum aminotransferase activity in five patients with chronic active hepatitis and five patients with acute hepatitis; the exception was one patient with acute hepatitis in whom serum aminotransferase levels fluctuated during treatment. Biopsy specimens obtained immediately after therapy showed improvement in hepatic histology in two of four patients with chronic active hepatitis and three of four patients with acute hepatitis. Cessation of interferon therapy was followed by a prompt increase in serum aminotransferase levels in five patients with chronic active hepatitis and in one patient with acute hepatitis, although re-elevated serum aminotransferase levels returned gradually to the normal range in the patient with acute hepatitis, but did not do so in five patients with chronic active hepatitis. In another patient with acute hepatitis whose serum aminotransferase levels fluctuated during interferon therapy, serum aminotransferase levels reached normal range after discontinuation of therapy. At 6 months and 12 months after discontinuation of interferon therapy, all five patients with chronic active hepatitis showed elevated serum aminotransferase levels, and all six patients with acute hepatitis showed normal serum aminotransferase levels. These results suggest that short-term and low doses of beta-interferon therapy has an only temporal effect on controlling the disease activity in patients with posttransfusion non-A, non-B chronic active hepatitis, and it might become an effective therapy for posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis.\r"

Each subject was given a series of 10 swallows of each of seven boluses, which consisted of water, mannitol solutions with osmolalities of 142, 296, 449, 704, and 1481 mOsm/kg, and orange juice (585 mOsm/kg), in a randomized fashion. Tracings were coded and analyzed blindly. Alterations in bolus osmolality did not elicit any significant changes in amplitude and duration of contraction, velocity of wave propagation, or the duration of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. We conclude that bolus osmolality does not play a significant role in the control of human esophageal motility, and that this lack of effect is explained by consideration of esophageal muscle mechanics.\r"

We therefore measured intragastric bile acid concentrations in 26 critically ill, artificially ventilated patients. The control group consisted of eight healthy volunteers, whose treatment was similar to that of the patients with respect to bed rest, enteral feeding, and administration of H2-blockers. Gastric contents were aspirated via a gastric tube every hour for 24 h. Patients had higher intragastric bile acid concentrations than healthy controls, whether fasting [median 1.3 mmol/L (range 0.7-2.5) versus 0.3 (0.2-0.5) (p less than 0.05)] or fed via a gastric tube [1.3 (0.4-4.0) versus 0.4 (0.2-0.7) (p less than 0.05)]. Physiotherapy, nursing, and drugs (opiates, benzodiazepines, dopamine, pirenzepine, and metoclopramide) had no detectable influence on intragastric bile acid concentrations and pH in patients. We conclude that patients at risk to develop stress lesions have largely increased gastric bile acid concentrations that probably are due to increased duodenogastric reflux. This might be relevant for stress lesion pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Ibuprofen, a commonly proscribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is also available in many countries, including the United States, without a prescription, is known to cause hemorrhage and erosion of the gastroduodenal mucosa. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of 200, 100, and 50 micrograms of misoprostol and placebo administered qid for 6 days, with a final dose on the morning of the 7th day, in the prevention of gastric and duodenal lesions induced by the concurrent administration of 800 mg of ibuprofen qid. A total of 120 healthy subjects with endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosae were enrolled in the study. The endoscopic examination was repeated 2 h after the final dose on day 7, and the mucosae were graded on a 0 to 4+ scale. In the stomach, all three misoprostol groups were significantly more protective than placebo and did not differ significantly from each other. In the duodenum, the endoscopic scores of the 200- and 100-micrograms misoprostol groups, but not the 50-micrograms group differed significantly from placebo. The 200- and 100-microgram groups did not differ significantly from each other, but both differed from the 50-micrograms group for duodenal mucosal injury. Subjective symptoms thought to be primarily attributable to the NSAID (e.g., pain, indigestion/heartburn and nausea) were recorded by each subject in a diary. Subjects in the 200-micrograms misoprostol group attained the greatest degree of mucosal protection and had a significantly higher incidence of indigestion/heartburn and abdominal pain than the placebo group. One can conclude that misoprostol in both antisecretory (200- and 100-micrograms) and non-antisecretory (50-micrograms) doses protects the gastric mucosa from injury from high anti-inflammatory doses of ibuprofen (3200 mg/day). Only the antisecretory doses (100 and 200 micrograms qid) were effective in the duodenum, suggesting that acid suppression is necessary for mucosal protection to occur in the duodenum.\r"

Therefore, the effects of synthetic atrial peptide (atriopeptin III, 24 amino acids) infusion on renal function and solute excretion were examined in 16 subjects with chronic renal insufficiency of diverse etiologies. After a two-hour baseline period, atrial peptide was infused for four hours in doses ranging from 0.005 to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min. When all doses were combined, absolute and fractional excretions of sodium increased significantly from baseline values (130 +/- 15 to 231 +/- 28 microEq/min and 3.57 +/- 0.57 to 6.03 +/- 1.26%, respectively, P less than 0.05). Significant increases in urinary excretion of chloride, calcium, and phosphorus were also seen during atrial peptide infusion. Increased absolute and fractional phosphorus excretion persisted during the two-hour postinfusion period, while excretion of other solutes returned to baseline. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increased by greater than 20% in five of 16 subjects. Two subjects with severe renal insufficiency (GFR = 9 and 12 mL/min) had no apparent response to atrial peptide infusion. Subjects receiving doses of 0.05 and 0.1 microgram/kg/min had significant falls of mean arterial pressure by the last hour of infusion. A dose-dependent effect of atrial peptide on sodium excretion was suggested, but not statistically significant. No apparent dose-dependent effect was seen on GFR or other solute excretions. Despite the presence of chronic renal insufficiency, atrial peptide increased renal solute excretion in most subjects. The demonstration that atrial peptide retains its diuretic and natriuretic effect in the presence of renal insufficiency supports the hypothesis that atrial peptide plays an important adaptive role in sodium homeostasis of the failing kidney.\r"

  ".W": "The Dogrib, an Amerindian tribe residing in the Northwest Territories of Canada, were typed for DNA and protein polymorphism at the apolipoprotein A-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster. Variation was seen at three previously described RFLPs detected with the enzymes SstI, PstI, and XmnI, though frequencies of these polymorphisms differ significantly from those reported in other populations. They exhibit no variation at two previously reported PvuII sites. No variation was seen in the APO A-I or APO A-IV gene products, with the Dogrib showing the most common isoelectric-focusing/immunoblot patterns of other world populations. Haplotype frequencies computed from inferred haplotypes and by maximum likelihood estimation did not differ significantly. The extent of nonrandom association of these sites is highly significant (P less than .00001), though pairwise analysis shows significance between the SstI and XmnI sites only. Levels of fasting triglyceride and fasting total cholesterol were determined for each individual. Analysis of covariance shows that fasting triglyceride levels in women vary significantly with the XmnI genotype. These results suggest that genetic variation at the APO A-I/C-III/A-IV gene cluster may be a useful tool for the study of quantitative lipoprotein variation in the Dogrib.\r"

A total of four positive overlapping clones were identified, and the sizes of the inserts were shown to vary from 0.8 to 2.8 kb. Nucleotide sequencing of the human cDNAs revealed that the largest clone, cHPN-16, contained both a 5' open reading frame encoding 582 amino acids and a 3' untranslated region of 1,063 nucleotides. Comparison of human cDNA sequences with mouse nidogen sequences revealed 84% identity on the nucleotide level and 88% identity with the deduced amino acid sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human cDNAs revealed the presence of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like repeats and the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), a potential cell binding site, two features previously identified in mouse nidogen. The sequence Asn-Pro-Ser, a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation, was also noted. The newly isolated human cDNAs were utilized to analyze the expression of the nidogen gene by cultured human cells. Northern hybridizations revealed a single mRNA transcript of approximately 6.0 kb in human skin fibroblast and in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cell cultures. However, the human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3, which expressed laminin genes, did not contain detectable levels of nidogen mRNAs. Quantitation of the relative nidogen mRNA abundance in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells indicated that nidogen mRNA levels were approximately the same as those for the laminin B2 chain. Finally, one of the nidogen cDNAs was used to map the nidogen gene onto locus q43 of chromosome 1.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Invasive aspergillosis in the immunocompromised host is one of the most difficult therapeutic problems. Itraconazole, a new oral triazole, is inhibitory as well as fungicidal against Aspergillus species in vitro. It is active against Aspergillus infections in animal models. We present our experience with itraconazole therapy of 21 patients with aspergillosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen of the 21 patients received 400 mg of itraconazole orally per day; the other three received 100 to 200 mg daily. Serum concentrations of itraconazole were measured and susceptibility testing was performed according to previously described methods. RESULTS: Of 15 evaluable patients, responses were produced in 12. Four of five with invasive pulmonary disease, two of two with skeletal disease, one of two with pleural disease, one of one with pericardial, sinus, mastoid, or hepatosplenic aspergillosis, and one of one with onychomycosis responded. One patient with carotid artery disease did not show a response, although results of cultures were negative at autopsy. One responder with joint disease had a possible relapse three months after completing 12 months of therapy. Ten of these patients were immunocompromised (including four with neutropenia and two renal transplant recipients) and eight of these responded. Side effects with itraconazole, in contrast to previously available therapy, were rare. CONCLUSION: This experience suggests itraconazole may be an important advance in the therapy of aspergillosis.\r"

Serial data were obtained in 11 patients. Nonpregnant age-matched women were used as controls (n = 14). In normal gestation and in chronic hypertension, atrial natriuretic factor levels were in the same range as that in the control group. Mean atrial natriuretic factor was significantly higher in the antepartum and postpartum periods in severe preeclampsia. There was an inverse relationship between atrial natriuretic factor and plasma renin activity in pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension or preeclampsia. Although fluctuations in atrial natriuretic factor levels did not predict preeclampsia, atrial natriuretic factor did correlate with the severity of the disease.\r"

Basal umbilical vein pressure was raised in the only acidotic fetus, whereas delta umbilical vein pressure was 0. Intraperitoneal pressure was recorded in 11 fetuses before and after transfusion, five of which were associated with fetal heart rate changes or preexisting ascites. Basal intraperitoneal pressure (2.5 mm Hg, confidence intervals 1.4 to 3.6) was significantly lower than basal umbilical vein pressure (confidence intervals, 3.2 to 5.8; p less than 0.02). In uncomplicated intraperitoneal transfusions, intraperitoneal pressure rose significantly (delta intraperitoneal pressure = +5.8; confidence intervals 2.9 to 8.8; p less than 0.005). In four transfusions associated with fetal bradycardia or tachycardia, delta intraperitoneal pressure (range, 16 to 26) was greater than in uncomplicated transfusions (range, 1 to 9). delta Intraperitoneal pressure was 0 in the fetus with ascites. These results implicate increases in umbilical vein pressure and intraperitoneal pressure in immediate complications of intrauterine transfusion, and support a role for intraperitoneal pressure monitoring during intraperitoneal transfusion.\r"

A population of human males, whose sperm demonstrated an inability to penetrate ovulated zona pellucida-free hamster eggs in vitro, were examined for the level of activity of beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase. The level of enzyme activity was found to be reduced in human sperm isolated from this group of individuals compared with a known hamster penetration-positive group. Analysis of the deoxyribonucleic acid from these individuals by Southern hybridization with a putative human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid clone to beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase identified a unique allele lacking 0.8 and 0.4 kb restriction fragments on digestion with the endonuclease Taq I. These results represent the first evidence to suggest that mutations could be associated with the human gene for galactosyltransferase. Our data help to clarify one of the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for sperm-egg binding/penetration interactions.\r"

We modeled the risk of anaphylaxis from penicillin, the risks and consequences of an artificial joint infection, and the actual variable costs of hospitalization and antibiotics. Penicillin prophylaxis is slightly less expensive than erythromycin prophylaxis but is both more expensive and less effective than no prophylaxis. Erythromycin prophylaxis, the most effective, is the most expensive strategy. The marginal cost effectiveness of erythromycin prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis is $12,900 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the risk of developing a joint infection is the key parameter in the analysis. Based on our estimated risk of developing a joint infection, the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis with erythromycin compares favorably with other medical interventions. Thus, until a definitive study to quantify the risk is conducted, patients with artificial joints should take prophylactic erythromycin when they undergo dental procedures.\r"

After 48 hr, intracellular putrescine was depleted and cells were positive when histochemically stained for the mitochondrial marker enzyme, NAD diaphorase, and exhibited mitochondrial proliferation and cristae development when examined by electron microscopy. This suggested that the mitochondrion was undergoing the physiological transformation necessary for successful transmission of the bloodstream form to the vector, namely the initiation of development of a TCA cycle and cytochrome system. The short stumpy forms that appeared by day 4 of culture, although physiologically transformed, were not viable in so far as they were not capable of transforming to procyclic trypomastigotes when introduced into SDM-79 medium. When rats infected with T. b. brucei were given 4% (w/v) DFMO in their drinking water, they were cured within 72 hr. Trypanosomes removed from animals and stained for NAD diaphorase showed mitochondrial transformation, as well as an intermediate and short stumpy morphology, at 36 and 60 hr, respectively. Data from this study on the growth and transformation characteristics of the DFMO induced intermediate and short stumpy form trypanosomes supports the observation that the intermediate form, and not the short stumpy form, is able to successfully transform to procyclic trypomastigotes.\r"

Following an initial screening, 280 individuals with greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine were randomly assigned to receive either 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg/kg of the drug in a single oral dose. Two to three months later, cure rates of 26%, 68%, 78%, and 84% were found for the 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg doses, respectively. The results of 10 mg/kg oral dosing were significantly worse than for all other doses in terms of cure rate and of post-treatment prevalence of morbidity. The 40 mg/kg dosing resulted in a significantly higher cure rate than the 20 mg/kg doses; nevertheless, there was no significant difference between 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg doses in terms of mean post-treatment intensity of infection or post-treatment prevalence of hematuria or proteinuria. For large-scale control programs, oral 20 mg/kg praziquantel therapy for urinary schistosomiasis may prove as effective as the standard oral 40 mg/kg dosing for control of infection-associated morbidity and reduction of parasite transmission.\r"

The assay uses a double sandwich technique, employing a pool of monoclonal antibodies to capture the antigen and a hyperimmune rabbit serum for antigen detection. Using pools of R. typhi infected Xenopsylla cheopis, Ctenocephalides felis, and Leptopsylla segnis, the sensitivity of the ELISA was compared with direct fluorescent antibody examination of individual fleas for rickettsiae and with rickettsial titers determined by plaque enumeration on primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (PFU). Pooled samples with less than 4 PFU of viable rickettsiae gave ELISA results which were not significantly above background. Both ELISA OD and ELISA titer (last dilution giving an OD that was 2 SD above the control) of a 1:10 dilution of homogenate (4 fleas/ml) were linearly related to rickettsial titer up to 10(6.8) PFU/sample. Multiple freeze-thaws of pools of infected fleas led to a rapid loss of ELISA sensitivity. ELISA assays on single fleas demonstrated large individual variability in rickettsial content. This was independent of the number of days postinfectious feeding or the mean number of PFU/flea (10(1.7-6.9) found for pooled fleas in the same cohort. The sensitivity and ease of performance of ELISA should make it usable under field conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Eleven species of small African wild mammals, laboratory rabbits, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. Low-titered viremia followed by development of antibody was observed in scrub hares (Lepus saxatilis), Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris), red veld rats (Aethomys chrysophilus), white tailed rats (Mystromys albicaudatus), bushveld gerbils (Tatera leucogaster), striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio), and guinea pigs. The maximum viremic titer in 4 scrub hares was 10(1.7-4.2) 50% mouse lethal doses/ml. Viremia was detected in 1/17 infected laboratory rabbits. Antibody response was only detected in South African hedgehogs (Atelerix frontalis), highveld gerbils (T. brantsii), Namaqua gerbils (Desmodillus auricularis), 2 species of multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis and M. coucha), and Syrian hamsters. The results of the study indicate that a proportion of infected scrub hares develop CCHF viremia of an intensity shown in the Soviet Union to be sufficient for infection of feeding immature ixodid ticks, but that South African hedgehogs and wild rodents are unlikely to be of importance as maintenance hosts of the virus in southern Africa.\r"

At tumor maturity, biopsies of viable tissue were obtained, frozen, and then assayed for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptor content. By simple linear regression analysis, progesterone receptor levels significantly correlated with both estrogen and androgen receptor levels, whereas estrogen and androgen receptor levels did not correlate with each other. Multiple regression analyses further substantiated the predictive value of the progesterone receptor for the other two hormone receptors. Knowledge of breast tumor androgen receptor levels may further enhance the value of the estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor in hormonal responsiveness. Further, the progesterone receptor may be the most sensitive of the steroid hormone receptors for selecting patients likely to respond to hormonal therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic ethanol feeding has been shown to enhance hepatic microsomal drug oxidation in humans and in laboratory animals. However, the effects of chronic ethanol administration on drug conjugation are less conclusive. We have studied the effects of chronic ethanol feeding on (a) the conjugation and elimination of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by the isolated perfused rat liver, (b) the formation of PNP glucuronide by hepatic microsomal PNP-glucuronyltransferase in vitro and (c) the hepatic content of UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA). PNP elimination from the isolated perfused rat liver was best described as a combination of parallel saturable and first-order processes. Ethanol pretreatment did not influence the former but resulted in a 48% reduction in the rate of elimination by the latter. This was associated with a significant reduction in recovery of PNP-glucuronide from bile, but no change in concentrations of PNP glucuronide or sulfate in perfusate. Michaelis constants and Vmax for PNP-glucuronyltransferase in native and solubilized microsomes and UDPGA concentrations in liver were not influenced by ethanol pretreatment. These results suggest that chronic ethanol treatment reduces PNP elimination in the intact liver primarily via a reduction in the biliary excretion of PNP glucuronide without altering glucuronidation per se.\r"

Immediate and delayed recall and recognition tests showed that diazepam impaired memory and that flumazenil partially reversed this impairment. The subjective ratings showed that diazepam produced physical and mental sedation and that flumazenil reversed this sedation. The reversal produced a return to presurgery scores for mental sedation but not for physical sedation or memory. For physical sedation, the difference between flumazenil and placebo was not demonstrable for more than 15 min after flumazenil administration; for mental sedation, it was demonstrable for as long as 60 min. The reversal by flumazenil of diazepam-induced memory impairment did not change significantly over time.\r"

Unanesthetized, spontaneously ventilating Sprague-Dawley rats, and rats anesthetized with either ketamine or thiopental whose ventilation was mechanically controlled, were studied. Intravenous administration of fentanyl (25, 50, or 100 micrograms/kg) caused an increase in electromyographic (EMG) activity in both unanesthetized and ketamine-anesthetized, but not in thiopental-anesthetized, animals. Muscle rigidity was more prominently manifested in the gastrocnemius muscle, when compared with the rectus abdominis muscle. Hypoxemia was exhibited during the course of rigidity by both spontaneously ventilating and ketamine-anesthetized rats, but not by thiopental-anesthetized animals. In addition, unanesthetized, spontaneously ventilating rats developed hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis. The authors suggest that, in addition to using unanesthetized animals, EMG activity in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats anesthetized with ketamine in whom ventilation is controlled may provide an alternative approach in the evaluation of fentanyl-induced muscle rigidity.\r"

Thirteen preparations were studied, seven nonpregnant (NP) and six pregnant (P). Mepivacaine 2 mg.kg-1.min-1 was infused at a constant rate into the femoral vein until toxic manifestations occurred, in the following sequence: convulsions, hypotension, respiratory arrest, and circulatory collapse. The doses and plasma concentrations of mepivacaine necessary to produce toxic symptoms were similar in NP and P animals, whereas, in a previous study, pregnancy enhanced the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine. No malignant ventricular arrhythmias were observed throughout the study. Protein binding of mepivacaine was also determined in sera from nonpregnant and pregnant ewes and compared with that for bupivacaine. Serum protein binding of mepivacaine was not reduced in pregnancy at the drug concentrations associated with toxic symptoms; at circulatory collapse, it was approximately 22% in NP and P. In contrast, the proportion of bound bupivacaine was 73% in NP and 51% in P, a significant difference. These protein binding data suggest that, although lethal concentrations of bupivacaine, determined in the previous study, were higher in NP than in P animals, concentrations of free drug were similar. Thus, the difference between the two drugs may be related to gestational increases in the availability of free drug in the case of bupivacaine.\r"

This conceptual error appears to have been introduced because new sampling catheter material has become available that effectively removes water vapor before samples reach the sample cell. This seems to have led some manufacturers to assume, incorrectly, that the 47 mmHg factor used to compute PCO2 in patients would no longer be needed. Users can test whether this error is present in an instrument by testing the effect of wet versus dry gases, and make appropriate corrections if the errors are present. Manufacturers should promptly correct this error in all instruments sold previously.\r"

The author reports three cases in which this treatment, erroneously applied to patients who were hypoxemic or had myocardial ischemia, resulted in death. This clinical experience motivated a study of the effects of paper bag rebreathing in normal volunteers. Subjects deliberately hyperventilated to an average end-tidal CO2 concentration of 21.6 (SD, 3.2) mm Hg and then continued to hyperventilate into a no. 4 Kraft brown paper bag containing the calibrated sensors for a Hewlett-Packard 47210A capnograph and a Teledyne TED 60J digital oxygen monitor. Fourteen men and six women with an average age of 36 years (SD, 6.1) were tested. Results are reported as mm Hg. After 30 seconds of rebreathing, mean change in O2 from room air was -15.9 (SD, 4.6) and mean CO2 was 38.7 (SD, 6.2); at 60 seconds, -20.5 (6.0) and 40.2 (6.4); at 90 seconds -22 (6.8) and 40.5 (6.4); at 120 seconds -23.6 (6.8) and 40.7 (6.5); at 150 seconds -25.1 (1.2) and 41 (7.3); and at 180 seconds -26.6 (8.4) and 41.3 (7.5). A few subjects achieved CO2 levels as high as 50, but many never reached 40. The mean maximal drop in O2 was 26 (8.8); seven subjects had drops in oxygen of 26 mm Hg at three minutes, four had drops of 34 mm Hg, and one had a drop of 42 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred five of the patients had blunt and 125 had penetrating trauma. One hundred eighty-seven patients (81%) were discharged home from the observation unit without any reported significant complications. Thirty-eight patients (17%) required admission to our hospital; four of the 38 underwent necessary laparotomy. In the 230 patients evaluated, no deaths or complications could be assigned to the use of 12 hours of observation in the unit. The use of an observation unit in our study resulted in the potential savings of $51,329. Our study supports the concept that selected patients with significant abdominal trauma and a negative DPL can be managed safely and cost effectively in an ED observation unit.\r"

In a first study, the response to anti-IgE, Staph A, Con A, f-met peptide, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 of basophils obtained from 52 donors was compared with that of mast cells isolated enzymatically (PMCE) or mechanically (PMCM) from lung parenchyma obtained during surgery. The histamine content of basophils (1.1 +/- 0.1 pg/cell) was significantly lower than that of PMCE (4.1 +/- 0.3 pg/cell; p less than 0.001) and PMCM (3.7 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "A low proportion of dietary calories as carbohydrate has been suggested for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because oxidation of carbohydrate (CHO) compared to fat results in greater CO2 production (VCO2) and, at the same arterial PCO2 (PaCO2), higher alveolar and minute ventilation (VE) and increased dyspnea. We hypothesized that a low CHO-high fat diet, although reducing VCO2 and VE at rest, might result in only a small change in VCO2 and VE during exercise. Eight healthy volunteers were randomized to receive for 24 h either isocaloric diets containing 10% or 70% of total calories from CHO (remainder of nonprotein calories from fat). Measurements of VCO2, VE, and respiratory gas exchange ratio (R) were made at rest and during constant work rate cycle exercise below the anaerobic threshold. Five to seven days later, the alternate diet was given and the studies were repeated. At rest, mean VCO2 and R were significantly lower after the low CHO diet compared to the high CHO diet. Mean resting VE was less but not significantly (high CHO 9.6 [0.7] versus low CHO 8.7 [0.8] L/min, mean [SEM]). During exercise, mean VCO2 and R were significantly less after the low CHO diet, but mean VE was only slightly smaller and not significantly different between diets (high CHO 25.4 [1.1] versus low CHO 24.0 [1.0] L/min). The increase in VCO2 from rest to exercise was relatively independent of the substrate mix recently consumed, suggesting that the exercising muscles use stored muscle glycogen as substrate during short bouts of low-intensity exercise despite changes in substrate utilization by nonmuscle tissues at rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty minutes after beginning O2, arterial PO2 differed among the three exposure groups. After exposure to the three concentrations of O2, there were no differences in Tc-DTPA clearance, vital capacity, FEV1/FVC, diffusing capacity, Factor VIII antigen, or fibronectin concentration. In contrast, all subjects complained of retrosternal pain during and after breathing 100% O2 (p less than 0.001). We conclude that with exposure to 100% O2, retrosternal pain, presumably from tracheal inflammation, occurs before detectable abnormalities of epithelial solute permeability (Tc-DTPA clearance), endothelial O2 injury (fibronectin concentration and Factor VIII), or pulmonary function. These findings indicate that symptoms are more sensitive than signs in detecting early O2 toxicity.\r"
