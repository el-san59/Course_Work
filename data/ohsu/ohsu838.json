  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that pancreatic islet glucose transport is mediated by a high-Km, low-affinity facilitated transporter similar to that expressed in liver. To determine the relationship between islet and liver glucose transporters, liver-type glucose-transporter cDNA clones were isolated from a human liver cDNA library. The liver-type glucose-transporter cDNA clone hybridized to mRNA transcripts of the same size in human liver and pancreatic islet RNA. A cDNA library was prepared from purified human pancreatic islet tissue and screened with human liver-type glucose-transporter cDNA. We isolated two overlapping cDNA clones encompassing 2600 base pairs, which encode a pancreatic islet protein identical in sequence to that of the putative liver-type glucose-transporter protein. Xenopus oocytes injected with synthetic mRNA transcribed from a full-length cDNA construct exhibited increased uptake of 2-deoxyglucose, confirming the functional identity of the clone. These cDNA clones can now be used to study regulation of expression of the gene and to assess the role of inherited defects in this gene as a candidate for inherited susceptibility to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "Chemotactic behavior in Escherichia coli is mediated by membrane-associated chemoreceptors that transmit sensory signals to the flagellar motors through an intracellular signaling system, which appears to involve a protein phosphorylation cascade. This study concerns the role of CheW, a cytoplasmic protein, in coupling methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), the major class of membrane receptors, to the intracellular signaling system. Steady-state flagellar rotation behavior was examined in a series of strains with different combinations and relative amounts of CheW, MCPs, and other signaling components. At normal expression levels, CheW stimulated clockwise rotation, and receptors appeared to enhance this stimulatory effect. At high expression levels, MCPs inhibited clockwise rotation, and CheW appeared to augment this inhibitory effect. Since overexpression of CheW or MCP molecules had the same behavioral effect as their absence, chemoreceptors probably use CheW to modulate two distinct signals, one that stimulates and one that inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation cascade.\r"

The extent of reversal of bound ATP hydrolysis to bound ADP and Pi as medium ATP concentration was lowered was determined by 18O-exchange measurements for yeast and neurospora vacuolar ATPases. The results show a pronounced increase in the extent of water oxygen incorporation into the Pi formed as ATP concentration is decreased to the micromolar range. The F1,F0-ATPase from neurospora mitochondria showed an even more pronounced modulation, similar to that of other F1-type ATPases. The vacuolar ATPases thus appear to have a catalytic mechanism quite analogous to that of the F1,F0-ATPases.\r"

A 487-base fragment of yeast genomic DNA encoding the amino-terminal region of protein X was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers based on amino-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. This DNA fragment was used as a probe to select two genomic DNA restriction fragments, which were cloned and sequenced. A 2.1-kilobase insert contains the complete sequence of the protein X gene. This insert has an open reading frame of 1230 nucleotides encoding a presequence of 30 amino acid residues and a mature protein of 380 amino acid residues (Mr, 42,052). Hybridization analysis showed that there is a single copy of the protein X gene and that the size of the mRNA is approximately 1.5 kilobases. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of yeast protein X and dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase indicates that the two proteins evolved from a common ancestor. The amino-terminal part of protein X (residues 1-195) resembles the acetyltransferase, but the remainder is quite different. There is strong homology between protein X and the acetyltransferase in the amino-terminal region (residues 1-84) that corresponds to the putative lipoyl domain. Protein X lacks the highly conserved sequence His-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Asp-Gly near the carboxyl terminus, which is thought to be part of the active site of all dihydrolipoamide acyltransferases.\r"

  ".W": "Mutant forms of the p53 cellular tumor antigen elicit neoplastic transformation in vitro. Recent evidence indicated that loss of normal p53 expression is a frequent event in certain types of tumors, raising the possibility that such loss provides transformed cells with a selective growth advantage. Thus, it was conceivable that the mutants might contribute to transformation by abrogating normal p53 function. We therefore studied the effect of plasmids encoding wild-type (wt) p53 on the ability of primary rat embryo fibroblasts to be transformed by a combination of mutant p53 and ras. It was found that wt p53 plasmids indeed caused a marked reduction in the number of transformed foci. Furthermore, wt p53 plasmids also suppressed the induction of transformed foci by combinations of bona fide oncogenes, such as myc plus ras or adenovirus E1A plus ras. On the other hand, plasmids carrying mutations in the p53 coding region totally failed to inhibit oncogene-mediated focus induction and often even slightly stimulated it. Hence, such mutations completely abolished the activity of wt p53 that is responsible for the \"suppressor\" effect. The latter fact is of special interest, since similar mutations in p53 are often observed in human and rodent tumors. The inhibitory effect of p53 was most pronounced when early-passage cells were used as targets, whereas established cell lines were less sensitive. These data support the notions that wt p53 expression may be restrictive to neoplastic progression and that p53 inactivation may play a crucial role in tumorigenesis.\r"

In an attempt to identify genes involved in the regulation of this pathway, high-copy-number plasmid suppressors of the heat shock sensitivity of the ira1 mutation were isolated. One such suppressor, MSI1, was found to encode a putative protein of 422 amino acids that shows homology to the beta subunit of the mammalian guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Overexpression of the MSI1 gene could suppress the heat shock sensitivity and the defect in sporulation caused by the ira1 and RAS2Val19 mutations but not those of the bcy1 mutation. Furthermore, the high level of intracellular cAMP in ira1 and RAS2Val19 cells was reduced by the MSI1 gene carried on a YEp-based plasmid. These results suggest that the MSI1 protein is a negative regulator of the RAS-mediated induction of cAMP in S. cerevisiae.\r"

In the present study, we have investigated p55c-fgr expression in normal human neutrophils [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN)] and have found enzymatically active p55c-fgr to be abundant in lysates of PMN and murine fibroblasts transfected with a FGR expression plasmid but not control cells. Fractionation studies revealed that neutrophil p55c-fgr was present in plasma membrane-enriched fractions as well as fractions containing secondary and tertiary granules. Little change in the distribution of p55c-fgr or FGR kinase activity was observed under conditions favoring tertiary granule release. In contrast, when secondary granule secretion was induced with the chemoattractant peptide, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, a marked decrease in p55c-fgr and FGR kinase was observed in fractions depleted of secondary granules. Concomitantly, the relative concentration of p55c-fgr and its enzymatic activity were increased in fractions containing plasma membrane. From these findings we conclude that p55c-fgr is associated with functional secretory granules and is redistributed within normal neutrophils in response to their activation.\r"

  ".W": "Despite recent advances in marrow stem cell purification, controversy about the nature and heterogeneity of cells with the potential for long-term repopulation of lymphoid and myeloid tissues remains. Essential to the resolution of these questions is the use of strategies to track the progeny produced in vivo from individual hemopoietic stem cells in purified populations. We have used a procedure for obtaining highly enriched populations of stem cells with competitive repopulating ability from male mice (pretreated with 5-fluorouracil), and in this paper we present the results of studies in which small numbers (150-2000) of these cells were exposed to supernatant containing a helper-free recombinant retrovirus carrying the neomycin-resistance gene and then were transplanted together with 2 x 10(5) \"compromised\" female marrow cells into irradiated female recipients. Male cells--i.e., progeny of purified stem cells--were found in one or more of the tissues examined (peripheral blood, marrow, spleen, and thymus) in 28 of 28 mice evaluated at various times between 35 and 196 days after transplantation. In 20 of these mice (71%), the neomycin-resistance gene was also detected, although not always at a level that correlated with the proportion of male cells. Analysis of spleen colonies (day 12) generated in secondary recipients confirmed that viral integration was confined to male repopulating cells. In three mice direct evidence of a common clone in both lymphoid and myeloid tissues was also obtained. These results show the feasibility of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to highly purified populations of lympho-myelopoietic stem cells with long-term (6 months) repopulating potential by using a supernatant infection protocol. This approach should facilitate further analysis of hemopoietic stem cell control in vivo and find future applications in the evolving use of bone marrow transplantation for hemopoietic rescue and gene therapy.\r"

Using ligand blotting, we have shown that a 67-kDa yeast nuclear envelope protein (p67) recognizes synthetic peptides containing the yeast histone H2B or simian virus 40 large tumor antigen nuclear localization sequence. Both free peptide and peptide conjugated to human serum albumin are recognized. The interaction between p67 and the nuclear localization sequences is specific; neither a mutant peptide that is incompetent for nuclear transport in vivo nor HSA can interact with p67 on blots. Moreover, although the wild-type peptide competes for binding to p67, the mutant peptides do not. p67 appears to be located at the nuclear envelope and is not present in other subcellular fractions. The nuclear localization sequence-binding protein is not extracted from the nuclear envelope with nonionic detergents and only partially extracted with high-salt buffer or 8 M urea, suggestive of a tight association with the nuclear envelope. Together our results are consistent with a role for p67 in nuclear transport.\r"

To study the role of CSF-1 in the pregnant female reproductive tract, the temporal expression and cellular sites of synthesis of CSF-1 and CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) mRNA were determined. CSF-1 mRNA, predominantly the 2.3-kilobase (kb) form, was first detected by in situ hybridization in uterine epithelium prior to implantation on day 3 and subsequently increased, reaching a peak at days 14-15. Its expression was restricted to the uterine epithelium at all stages of gestation and was not localized to areas of implantation. CSF-1R mRNA was first detected in maternal decidua at day 6. It was expressed in the decidua basalis during placentation, after which its expression declined. At day 7.5, trophectodermal cells also expressed CSF-1R mRNA; during placentation, it was found also in the diploid trophoblasts. The high level of CSF-1R mRNA expression by trophoblast giant cells was independent of their location around the conceptus. There was a differential distribution of CSF-1R mRNA expression in the mature placenta, with expression in the giant trophoblastic layer greater than spongiotrophoblastic layer greater than labyrinthine layer until term. Yolk sac cells also expressed low levels of CSF-1R mRNA. The coincidence of uterine CSF-1 mRNA expression and CSF-1 synthesis with both placental growth and CSF-1R mRNA expression in decidual cells and trophoblasts strongly implicates CSF-1 in the regulation of placental growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".U": "90046886\r", 
  ".W": "A revertant (SPR1) from a high-frequency petite strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown by mapping and sequence analysis to have a rearranged mitochondrial genome. In vivo rearrangement has occurred through a subgenomic-recombination pathway involving the initial formation of subgenomic molecules in nascent petite mutants, recombination between these molecules to form an intermediate with direct repeats, and subsequent excision of the resident or symposed duplication to yield a molecule with three novel junctions and a changed gene order. Sequencing of the novel junctions shows that intramolecular recombination in each case occurs by means of G + C-rich short direct repeats of 40-51 base pairs. Mapping and sequence analysis also reveal that the SPR1 mitochondrial genome lacks three sectors of the wild-type molecule of 4.4, 1.7, and 0.5 kilobases. Each of these sectors occurs in nontemplate, base-biased DNA, that is over 90% A + T. Absence of these sectors together with a rearranged gene order does not appear to affect the phenotype of SPR1, as colony morphology and growth rate on a number of different substrates are not detectably different from the wild type. Lack of phenotypic change suggests that mitochondrial gene expression has not been noticeably disrupted in SPR1 despite deletion of the consensus nonomer promoter upstream from the glutamic acid tRNA gene. Dispensability of DNA sectors and the presence of recombinogenic short, direct repeats are mandatory features of the subgenomic-recombination pathway for creating rearrangements in baker's yeast mtDNA. It is proposed that, in other organisms, organelle genomes containing these elements may undergo rearrangement by the same steps.\r"

This overexpression was unrelated to any stage of cellular differentiation and was not due to gene rearrangement or amplification.

Molecular analysis showed that BCL2 was rearranged in the major breakpoint cluster region and had joined into the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene as in follicular lymphoma. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged MYC gene revealed that MYC was truncated at the Pvu II site at the end of the first exon of MYC and had joined into the regulatory elements of a gene that we called BCL3 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3). The BCL3 locus was mapped to chromosome 17 band q22. We found BCL3 transcribed as a message of 1.7 kilobases in many hematopoietic cell lines representing all hematopoietic lineages. In the patient's leukemia cells, the truncated MYC gene was highly expressed under the influence of BCL3 regulatory elements, leading to an aggressive B-cell leukemia that presumably had been derived from an indolent lymphoma carrying a rearranged BCL2 gene.\r"

These findings indicate that MutY is a DNA glycosylase that hydrolyzes the glycosyl bond linking the mis-paired adenine to deoxyribose. MutY, a 5'-apurinic/apyrimidinic-site endonuclease, DNA polymerase I, and DNA ligase are sufficient to reconstitute MutY-dependent G-A to G.C repair in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a common feature of AIDS. Approximately 30-40% of these tumors exhibit clinical features suggestive of endemic Burkitt lymphoma: they are aggressive malignancies that occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus infection, they arise in the setting of immunosuppression, and they carry t(8;14) translocations without detectable rearrangement of the MYC oncogene. To understand the molecular basis of these parallels, we analyzed a case of Epstein-Barr-positive AIDS-associated undifferentiated lymphoma. Southern blots show that the tumor exhibits immunoglobulin joining segment rearrangement but no rearrangement of the MYC oncogene. Cloning of the rearranged joining segment allowed the isolation of recombinant clones encompassing the translocation breakpoint, and sequencing of the translocation junction disclosed that the breakpoint is situated 7 base pairs from the chromosome 14 site involved in a previously described endemic Burkitt lymphoma translocation. Furthermore, the breakpoint is situated far from MYC on chromosome 8, a constant finding in endemic Burkitt lymphomas. That the molecular architecture of the translocation in this case is strikingly similar to previously analyzed translocations from endemic Burkitt lymphomas strongly suggests that common molecular mechanisms must be operative in the pathogenesis of these tumors.\r"

Synthesis and processing of gag proteins occurred in mammalian cells infected with this live recombinant virus, and reverse transcriptase was detected largely in the medium. Electron micrographs revealed immature retrovirus-like particles budding from the plasma membrane and extracellular particles with morphological characteristics of immature and mature human immunodeficiency virus. The latter contained functional reverse transcriptase as well as processed p24 and p17 gag polypeptides. Thus, assembly and maturation of human immunodeficiency virus-like particles can occur in the absence of either infectious RNA molecules or env proteins. The production of noninfectious virus-like particles by expression vectors should be useful for biochemical studies and could provide a safe source of material for the development of vaccines.\r"

Here we report a set of experiments that suggests distinct roles for two major classes of glutamate receptors in a discrete premotor nucleus of the brainstem. The medullary pacemaker nucleus of weakly electric fish is an endogenous oscillator that controls the electric organ discharge (EOD). Its regular frequency of firing is modulated during several distinct behaviors. The pacemaker nucleus continues firing regularly when isolated in vitro, and modulatory behaviors can be reproduced by stimulating the descending input pathway. Glutamate agonists applied to the pacemaker in vitro produced increases in frequency, while glutamate antagonists selectively blocked stimulus-induced modulations. Experiments with glutamate antagonists in the intact animal resulted in specific effects on two well-characterized behaviors. Our data indicate that these behaviors are separately mediated in the pacemaker by receptors displaying characteristics of the kainate/quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartate subtypes of glutamate receptor, respectively.\r"

We show that glutamate and related amino acids, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate, markedly stimulate arginine--citrulline transformation in cerebellar slices stoichiometrically with enhancement of cGMP levels. N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine blocks the augmentation both of citrulline and cGMP with identical potencies. Arginine competitively reverses both effects of N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine with the same potencies. Hemoglobin, which complexes nitric oxide, prevents the stimulation by N-methyl-D-aspartate of cGMP levels, and superoxide dismutase, which elevates nitric oxide levels, increases cGMP formation. These data establish that nitric oxide mediates the stimulation by glutamate of cGMP formation.\r"

Patients with ILD tend to have a resting and disproportionate exercise tachycardia; resting or exercise-induced arterial desaturation; a rapid shallow breathing pattern; and in more severe cases an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure with an associated increase in right ventricular work. Although the acute exercise responses of patients with ILD have been documented, studies on their responses to exercise training are lacking. We, therefore, discuss some of the physiologic consequences of ILD and the clinical measures available to assess these patients at rest and during exercise. We present the implications of these changes for functional ability and propose that modified endurance training is important to the patient with ILD. Potential directions for clinical research in exercise training of patients with ILD are presented.\r"

One-thousand one-hundred and thirty-nine mice were bred, and surgery was performed on 48. At least one fetus was present that had a cleft lip in 21 mice, and repairs were done on 16 fetuses. Ultimately, 9 viable fetuses were studied. In all cases, lip continuity was present where the suture had coapted the edges. There was little or no evidence of the lip repair despite no incision being performed. Histologic examination revealed epithelial and mesenchymal continuity with an occasional notch noted in the epithelium and soft-tissue asymmetry in complete clefts.

  ".U": "90047634\r", 
  ".W": "Biphasic contrast studies are generally advocated as the best current barium examination for the upper GI tract. Two recent prospective blinded trials compared the diagnostic results of a biphasic contrast examination--employing a medium-density barium suspension and glucagon--and endoscopy. Both methods appear to have nearly equal merit for the detection of peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma. One of the trials demonstrated a relative inability of the barium examination to depict reflux esophagitis other than the severe variety, an inability that had been previously recognized. Earlier Japanese studies showed excellent results from biphasic studies in the detection of early and advanced gastric carcinoma. Because gastric carcinoma may present as a wide variety of lesions, ranging from minute alterations in mucosal relief through ulcers to masses, the values from these Japanese studies also test the sensitivity and specificity of the radiographic examination in demonstrating non-neoplastic lesions of the stomach. Ample data have shown that a radiographic examination compares favorably with endoscopy in the detection of esophageal carcinoma. The usefulness of a radiographic examination as a primary examination if disturbances of esophageal motor function are suspected is generally recognized. A state-of-the-art radiographic examination (ie, a biphasic examination, preferably with drug-induced hypotony) therefore appears to represent an appropriate initial examination in evaluation of most disorders of the upper GI tract. If this examination prompts the slightest suspicion of a malignant tumor, endoscopy should follow for the purpose of obtaining biopsy specimens. Endoscopy is not necessary if duodenal ulcers have been diagnosed by means of radiography; in typically benign gastric ulcers, radiographic follow-up without endoscopy may safely be considered. If in elderly patients multiple small gastric polyps have been detected, endoscopy is not needed. If complaints persist after negative results at radiographic examination, however, endoscopic intervention must be considered. If the complaints suggest reflux esophagitis, the clinician can choose between treatment and endoscopy. In a patient with acute upper GI bleeding, primary endoscopy may be preferred. This diagnostic approach in which endoscopy is employed as complementary to the barium examination is in most parts of the world a cost-effective one. It is also the safest possible option; although endoscopic complications are rare, their absolute number cannot be ignored if every patient had to undergo endoscopy. A biphasic approach with a medium-density barium suspension can be attempted in nearly every patient; if the patient proves unable to cooperate for an optimal double-contrast examination, a single-contrast examination can be performed with the same barium swallowed.\r"

In all 62 patients, the papillary process appeared above and in front of the common hepatic artery close to the portal vein and pancreatic isthmus. Enlarged papillary processes were more frequently seen in patients with chronic liver disease.

These measurements showed a close correlation (r = .968) with those obtained by means of Doppler ultrasound (US). Increases in portal blood flow after oral administration of ethanol and glucose were measured with DBI. Glucose caused a statistically greater increase in portal blood flow volume in healthy control subjects than in patients with chronic hepatitis. Blood sugar, on the other hand, showed a significantly greater increase in these patients, possibly reflecting the greater vascular resistance of the liver. DBI is a useful noninvasive method of measuring portal blood flow without the limitations imposed on Doppler US by obesity and intestinal gas.\r"

In six cases of this rare abnormality, sonographically normal fetuses subsequently demonstrated ventriculomegaly, porencephaly, cerebral atrophy, or microcephaly following demise of the co-twin. Extracranial abnormalities included small bowel atresia (two cases) and renal cortical necrosis (one case). Surviving twins all had neurodevelopmental delay at follow-up. Two fetuses were aborted because of sonographically apparent, progressively severe brain abnormality. The lone survivor of a dizygotic triplet gestation was normal, despite sonographic findings of TES in the co-triplets. Because of poor outcome, prenatal sonographic diagnosis of TES may influence antenatal or neonatal management of the surviving monozygous twin. Recognition of TES may permit accurate postnatal counseling of prognosis and recurrence risks.\r"

Each of 50 subjects was randomly assigned to one of the interventions. Intervention 1 involved provision of information about the imager and nature of the examination. Intervention 2 included information and counseling. Intervention 3 included information and a 12-minute relaxation exercise. Anxiety levels were measured by means of a 20-item questionnaire before and after imaging. The latter provided a retrospective report of anxiety experienced during imaging. Patients in intervention group 3 showed significantly less increase in anxiety compared with those in groups 1 and 2. Overall, only patients who participated in intervention 1 showed a significant increase in anxiety during imaging. When anxiety levels experienced before and during the examination were compared, with the focus on each questionnaire item for each group, those in group 1 showed a significant increase in anxiety on eight of 20 items; those in group 2, three items; and those in group 3, none. Psychologic preparation that includes relaxation strategies is more effective than provision of information alone.\r"

Only the point of maximal color shift on the color map was used for spectral analysis. When compared with angiography in 60 carotid bifurcations, a measured peak systolic velocity above 1.25 m/sec was 87% accurate in the detection of significant internal carotid artery stenoses greater than 50%. Determination of maximal internal carotid artery velocity was 40% faster with color-Doppler-assisted duplex sonography than with nonassisted duplex ultrasound. The correlation coefficient for interobserver agreement was .90. It increased to .97 when cases of extensive (greater than 1 cm) acoustic shadowing (7% of bifurcations) were excluded. The authors conclude that the color flow map is an accurate and reproducible means of depicting the point of maximal stenosis within the internal carotid artery.\r"

In 1883, Zuckerkandl described the posterior renal fascia but did not recognize the presence of the anterior renal fascia. In 1895, Gerota documented the presence of the anterior renal fascia and clearly assigned Zuckerkandl's name to the posterior renal fascia. Thus, the terms Zuckerkandl fascia and posterior renal fascia are synonymous, as are Gerota fascia and anterior renal fascia.\r"

  ".U": "90047701\r", 
  ".W": "The human heart in the fasting state extracts FFA, glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies from the systemic circulation. Of these substrates, FFA utilization accounts for the greater part of oxygen consumption and energy production. The oxidative use of lipid (FFA) and carbohydrate (glucose and lactate) fuels is reciprocally regulated through the operation of Randle's cycle. Feeding, by increasing both insulin and glucose concentration, shifts myocardial metabolism towards preferential carbohydrate usage, both for oxidative energy generation and for glycogen synthesis. During conditions of reduced oxygen supply, the oxidation of all substrates is decreased while anaerobic metabolism is activated. In patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris, lactate release in the CS can be demonstrated during pacing stress. However, this occurs in only 50% of patients, and no relationship can be demonstrated between lactate production and the severity of ischemia. In patients with chronic angina, a significant release of alanine in the CS and an increased myocardial uptake of glutamate could be demonstrated at rest and following pacing. These two phenomena result from increased transamination of excess pyruvate to alanine with glutamate serving as NH2 donor. In addition, release of citrate (a known inhibitor of glycolysis) in the CS can be demonstrated following pacing in patients with stable angina. The introduction of PET has made it possible to study regional myocardial perfusion and metabolism in humans noninvasively. Two basically different patterns of myocardial glucose utilization have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease studied at rest using 18F-flurodeoxyglucose. In patients with stable angina on exercise but studied at rest, regional myocar- dial glucose utilization was homogeneously low and comparable with that of a group of normals. In contrast, in patients with unstable angina, myocardial glucose utilization at rest was increased even in the absence of symptoms and ECG signs of acute ischemia. In patients with stable angina, a prolonged increase in glucose uptake could be demonstrated in the post-ischemic myocardium in the absence of perfusion abnormalities, and a state of chronic metabolic ischemia is proposed. PET imaging has also allowed prospective differentiation between viable and nonviable segmental function in patients with recent myocardial infarction and in those undergoing coronary artery surgery; in both cases viable segments have relatively maintained glucose uptakes, whereas nonviable segments have depressed glucose uptakes.\r"

  ".W": "Since the early 1900s, coffee has been implicated as having adverse effects on human health. Recent attention has focused on coffee's relation to CHD, but because of conflicting results of epidemiologic studies on coffee and CHD mortality, attention has turned to the effects of coffee and caffeine on individual CHD risk factors. Coffee's effect on serum lipids does not appear to be due to caffeine. If in fact an adverse effect on lipids exists, it may be related to other factors including biochemical constituents other than caffeine, hardness of the water used in preparation, and the method of preparation, filtered coffee having no effect. The data are fairly convincing that chronic coffee ingestion does not induce hypertension, although acute consumption produces a small, short-lived increase in BP. The least well understood effect of coffee is its potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias, including potentially lethal ventricular ectopy in certain individuals. More work is needed in this area of arrhythmias before any concrete recommendations can be made. Until more convincing evidence against coffee is compiled, it appears that, at least in moderate amounts in otherwise healthy persons, coffee is a safe beverage.\r"

The steady growth of its importance makes knowledge of its activity and effects clinically relevant. The intrinsic antibiotic activity of cyclosporine is limited; although it inhibits certain viruses, fungi, protozoa, and helminths, in practical terms these effects are insignificant. Both controlled and noncontrolled studies have shown that infection is an infrequent problem in patients with autoimmune diseases who are receiving relatively low doses. The use of cyclosporine in the setting of transplantation does not increase--and may in fact decrease--the incidence of infection in comparison with that during standard immunosuppressive therapy. Fungal, viral, and bacterial diseases remain a risk, however, and are a significant cause of morbidity in this population. Antimicrobial therapy may alter cyclosporine levels and cause nephrotoxicity or graft rejection. Careful monitoring of cyclosporine levels during antimicrobial treatment is therefore recommended.\r"

Concurrent use of ketoconazole or erythromycin results in increased serum cyclosporine levels, with associated potential nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity. Rifampin and perhaps nafcillin induce cytochrome P-450-dependent isoenzyme metabolism of cyclosporine. The resultant decreased bioavailability of cyclosporine may precipitate graft rejection. The aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amphotericin B have been associated with increased nephrotoxicity, independent of the levels of cyclosporine or antibiotic present. Anticipation of potential antibiotic interactions and appropriate monitoring of levels of cyclosporine and antibiotics and of renal function are critical to the avoidance of reversible causes of graft failure or organ toxicity.\r"

The infrequency of this infection has made its study difficult and has complicated the issues of treatment and prognosis.

Seventy-five percent of the children and 35% of the adults had central nervous system trauma or surgery; 45% of adults had comorbid disease that might have predisposed them to infection. Clinical presentation did not distinguish this form of meningitis from other bacterial meningitides. Findings in cerebrospinal fluid were characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Blood cultures were positive in 65% of cases. Overall mortality was 37%; 50% of adults but no children died of meningitis. No patients with S. aureus meningitis complicating cerebrospinal fluid shunts died; however, nine of 11 patients with identifiable foci of infection outside the central nervous system died. Only one patient receiving initial treatment with a penicillinase-resistant penicillin died of meningitis, whereas six of 12 patients not so treated died.\r"

  ".W": "Contemporary hypotheses that consider the severe forms of periodontal disease to be infections caused by site-specific microbes fail to satisfactorily explain the epidemiologic, anthropologic, and clinical features of periodontal diseases. The microbes that have been designated as periodontopathogens are commensal bacteria present in periodontal health and disease. Association of specific bacteria with various disease forms has been established, but association is confused with causation. None of the periodontal diseases can be transmitted between individuals or between diseased and healthy sites of a susceptible person. Past and present concepts of the etiology of the periodontal diseases are reviewed, and the deficiencies of contemporary periodontal theory are outlined. Host factors rather than bacteria determine whether gingivitis extends to horizontal periodontitis. Angular alveolar lesions, the severe form of periodontal bone loss, are hypothesized to be caused by the spread of pulpal inflammation to the adjacent periodontal tissues. When the resultant dental abscess becomes contiguous with the alveolar crest and gingival sulcus, secondary colonization of deep pockets by site-specific oral bacteria-selected for by the complex conditions of the site-can occur. This explanation accounts for the distribution of periodontopathogens, the localization of angular alveolar lesions, and the bursts of activity by which the disease progresses.\r"

Colonially created cities in the region still discriminate economically and socially against women. Rapid urbanization is occurring, but migrants maintain strong ties with rural areas. Traditional attitudes towards marriage and sexuality affect urban behavior in the extent of marital stability, the frequency of polygyny, and the emotional bond between spouses. Ethnic groups in Kampala and Nairobi exemplify the cultural foundations of two forms of sexual relations found in the region, one characterized by prostitution and the other by small circles of interchanging lovers. The first results in a more rapid spread of HIV through the urban population and outwards into rural areas. Each pattern exerts unique constraints on behavioral change and requires different prevention campaigns.\r"

However, the worldwide prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis is difficult to determine because adequate data are lacking. In this paper more than 100 epidemiologic studies reporting on the prevalence of S. stercoralis among various populations on five continents are critically reviewed. Analysis of this information indicates that the following groups of people may be at risk: residents of an emigrants from any developing country and southern, eastern, and central Europe; travelers and veterans returning from endemic areas; natives and residents of the Appalachian region in the United States and local endemic areas in other countries; and institutionalized persons. Because disseminated infections may be prevented by early treatment of asymptomatic chronic infections, screening programs are recommended to detect latent S. stercoralis infection before the initiation of chemotherapy or immunosuppression in patients at risk. Serologic tests are sensitive and specific but are not yet widely available. Thus strong suspicion based on clinical and epidemiologic clues in conjunction with repeated stool examinations remains the best way to rule out S. stercoralis infection in these groups.\r"

While the most commonly diagnosed infections due to this organism are endocarditis and septic arthritis, there have also been isolated reports of bacteremia, diskitis, abscesses, meningitis, and oropharyngeal infections. The treatment of choice is penicillin, to which K. kingae strains are uniformly susceptible.

The historical context illustrates the reaction of large populations to deadly disease: fear, helplessness, and acceptance of an ever present threat. Concepts of prophylaxis to ward off the infection were haphazard, empiric, and often dependent on the use of medicaments and treatments that were, in modern terms, irrational. The medical and hygienic concepts of the time were principal impediments to more successful control, as is demonstrated by quotations from official documents dealing with attempts to cope with the epidemic. The development of control measures was painfully slow, and ultimate control was not achieved until socioeconomic improvement and concepts of hygiene both reached the point at which the conditions for the spread of the disease could be minimized.\r"

Cases were acquired in 31 states; however, 86% of the cases were acquired in seven states: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. For 63% of patients the disease began in summer; 52% recalled a tick bite. Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) occurred in 91% of the patients; arthritis, in 57%; neurologic complications, in 18%; and cardiac manifestations, in 10%. When serum samples were obtained greater than or equal to 21 days after onset of symptoms, 14% (6 of 42) with ECM alone and 19% (17 of 89) with complicated Lyme disease (ECM plus organ-system involvement) had positive serologic tests. Antimicrobial therapy did not appear to affect serologic response. Lyme disease is now the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States and has been reported from 32 states since 1980. Physicians nationwide need to be familiar with the protean signs and symptoms associated with Lyme disease and with the limitations of current serologic techniques in diagnosing early illness.\r"

Following ingestion by a tick, B. burgdorferi lodges in the midgut diverticula, in some instances penetrating the gut wall and invading various tissues. Certain investigators suggest that transmission of the spirochete occurs via infectious saliva, although, in light of the fact that only 5% of adult ticks are systemically infected, this mechanism is open to question. Alternatively, transmission may occur via periodic regurgitation of gut fluids during the feeding process. While ticks of the genus Ixodes were once thought to be the only vectors, it now appears that other genera, and possibly other hematophagous arthropods, may also be involved.\r"

In Lyme disease foci in North America where I. dammini is common, Borrelia burgdorferi or similar types of spirochetes have been cultured from 10 species of wild or domestic mammals and from one species of songbird. The prevalence of infected rodents is remarkably high (greater than or equal to 75%) in these foci. Several different antigenic variants of B. burgdorferi have been cultured. Initial isolates of B. burgdorferi in North America were remarkably homogeneous, but documentation of different variants is increasing. The association of different antigenic variants with diseases in humans and domestic animals needs to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "Lyme disease, first identified in 1975, is the most recently recognized of the seven human spirochetal diseases; the evolving clinical picture of Lyme disease indicates it shares many features with the other diseases. These similarities are striking in view of the diverse epidemiology of the seven diseases, which are caused by Treponema species (spread by human-to-human contact) or Leptospira or Borrelia species (zoonoses). These similarities include the following: (1) skin or mucous membrane as portal of entry; (2) spirochetemia early in the course of disease, with wide dissemination through tissue and body fluid; and (3) one or more subsequent stages of disease, often with intervening latent periods. Lyme disease shares with many spirochetal diseases a tropism for skin and neurologic and cardiovascular manifestations, whereas chronic arthritis is unique to Lyme disease. These similarities and dissimilarities offer opportunities to discover which properties unique to the pathogenic spirochetes are responsible for clinical manifestations and suggest that certain clinical features of patients with spirochetal diseases other than Lyme disease may someday be recognized in patients with Lyme disease.\r"

  ".W": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, has two major outer-membrane proteins, OspA and OspB, which act as surface antigens. A 49-kilobase linear plasmid contains the genes that encode for these surface proteins. Direct examination of denatured plasmid molecules has revealed single-stranded circles with a circumference of approximately 100 kilobases (about twice the length of the linear duplex molecule), a finding that indicates the plasmid strands have covalently closed ends. This form of DNA, while present in eukaryotic organisms and their viruses, has not been observed in a prokaryotic organism. Plasmid heterogeneity has been observed in strains with surface proteins of similar molecular weights and similar monoclonal antibody reactivity. Thus, plasmid analysis may prove a sensitive tool for differentiating strains of B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, since loss of plasmids in vitro has been correlated with loss of the ability of many-passaged strains to cause infection, borrelial plasmids may encode for virulence factors as well.\r"

Two distinct types of neuroborreliosis occur at different stages of Lyme disease. Second-stage Lyme meningitis resembles aseptic meningitis and is often associated with facial palsies, peripheral nerve involvement, and/or radiculopathies. Lyme meningitis may be the first evidence of Lyme disease, occurring without a history of erythema chronicum migrans or flu-like illness. Third-stage parenchymal involvement causes a multitude of nonspecific CNS manifestations that can be confused with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, and psychiatric derangements. Manifestations of CNS parenchymal involvement in Lyme disease are generally associated, however, with a history of erythema chronicum migrans, meningitis, or carditis. Both second- and third-stage Lyme neuroborrelioses are commonly misdiagnosed because they are relatively uncommon and because they mimic many better-known disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Immune responses to Borrelia burgdorferi infection are now well characterized. Following infection there is an early T cell response and a more slowly evolving B cell response. IgM antibodies appear first and are followed by IgG and IgA. Early antibodies are primarily against a 41-kilodalton flagellum-associated antigen; responses to other spirochetal antigens develop later. Serologic assays that use whole B. burgdorferi preparations are not always able to detect an early rise in antibodies above a background of crossreactive antibodies present in most uninfected individuals. Moreover, some individuals with neurologic involvement who lack diagnostic levels of serum antibody to B. burgdorferi have high levels of the antibody in their cerebrospinal fluid. Specific T cell blastogenesis to B. burgdorferi can further document infection. Analysis of T cell subsets in Lyme arthritis demonstrates a marked decrease in the CD4+2H4+ subpopulation in the synovial fluid, although normal numbers of these cells are present in peripheral blood. Immunologic measurements are useful in evaluating and treating a wide array of patients who may be infected with B. burgdorferi.\r"

Neurophysiologic evidence of peripheral neuropathy was present in 64 of 137 patients tested. Measures of distal axon function (sensory amplitude and conduction velocity, motor terminal latency) were most affected. Repeat studies following 60 patients receiving antimicrobial therapy demonstrated significant improvement in these values. Before and after therapy 17 patients with late Lyme borreliosis and prominent subjective cognitive dysfunction underwent neuropsychologic tests of memory, conceptual ability, concentration, psychomotor function, overlearned intellectual abilities, and mood. Significant abnormalities were evident before treatment; all reversed with antimicrobial therapy. Many patients with this encephalopathy had specific abnormalities revealed by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and had evidence of intrathecal synthesis of antibody to Borrelia. These findings indicate that late Lyme borreliosis commonly causes nervous system abnormalities that are reversible with appropriate antibiotic therapy.\r"

Tetracycline and penicillin G are most often used clinically, although laboratory studies suggest that the bactericidal activity of penicillin G may be inadequate. Treponema pallidum cannot be satisfactorily cultured. It is identified by dark-field microscopy. Studies of in vivo sensitivity show that penicillin G is highly active against the syphilis pathogen. Since syphilis and gonorrhea may occur simultaneously, ceftriaxone, which is as active as penicillin G against T. pallidum but is also active against penicillinase-producing gonococci, is a logical choice for therapy. Borrelia burgdorferi has been cultured from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and skin of patients with Lyme disease. In vitro studies have shown tetracycline and erythromycin to be effective against B. burgdorferi and penicillin G to be less so, although all are commonly used clinically. Ceftriaxone has also proven to be highly effective in laboratory studies and for clinical treatment.\r"

Recent increases in the syphilis rates in the United States and concerns about the adequacy of currently recommended therapy for syphilis in patients with concomitant human immunodeficiency virus infection have stimulated reappraisal of alternatives to currently recommended therapy. Desirable features of antimicrobial agents for syphilotherapy include long serum half-life, good penetration into the central nervous system, and ease of administration. Benzathine penicillin provides prolonged treponemicidal levels of penicillin G in serum but does not reliably produce adequate levels of penicillin in the central nervous system. Tetracycline requires multiple daily dosing, has relatively frequent adverse effects, and has unproven efficacy for central nervous system involvement. Erythromycin, which may be less active than tetracycline for syphilis therapy, has similar shortcomings. Recent evaluations of ceftriaxone for early syphilis therapy are promising; however, the optimal dose and duration of therapy are unknown. No currently recommended therapy for syphilis is clearly optimal for reliable, cost-effective therapy. Careful reappraisal of currently available syphilotherapy and alternatives is needed.\r"

Although both beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotics have been shown to be effective in the treatment of this spirochetosis, the development of optimal therapeutic modalities has been hampered by the lack of reliable microbiologic or immunologic criteria for the diagnosis or cure of this infection. In vitro sensitivity studies have been performed by several laboratories, but there has been no standardization of the methodology for measuring either inhibitory or bactericidal levels. Clinical studies have documented the efficacy of antibiotics, but therapy has failed in as many as 50% of cases of chronic infection. Although new antibiotic regimens appear promising, the optimal treatment of this infectious disease remains to be determined. In this report we review the clinical and experimental rationale for the antibiotic regimens that we currently use and the need for a more standardized approach to treatment trials.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that the p53 gene located on 17p13 has many features of such an antioncogene. The p53 gene was frequently mutated or inactivated in all types of human lung cancer. The genetic abnormalities of p53 include gross changes such as homozygous deletions and abnormally sized messenger RNAs along with a variety of point or small mutations, which map to the p53 open reading frame and change amino acid sequence in a region highly conserved between mouse and man. In addition, very low or absent expression of p53 messenger RNA in lung cancer cell lines compared to normal lung was seen. These findings, coupled with the previous demonstration of 17p allele loss in lung cancer, strongly implicate p53 as an anti-oncogene whose disruption is involved in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer.\r"

A translocated and mutated allele of c-myc was stably transfected into fibroblasts.

To avoid the reversion to toxicity and the loss of immunogenicity that may follow chemical treatment of pertussis toxin, inactive toxins were constructed by genetic manipulation. A number of genetically engineered alleles of the pertussis toxin genes, constructed by replacing either one or two key amino acids within the enzymatically active S1 subunit, were introduced into the chromosome of strains of Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica. These strains produce mutant pertussis toxin molecules that are nontoxic and immunogenic and that protect mice from the intracerebral challenge with virulent Bordetella pertussis. Such molecules are ideal for the development of new and safer vaccines against whooping cough.\r"

Cell biological methods have provided knowledge of cycle kinetics and of substages of G1 that are determined by extracellular signals. Through the use of biochemical and molecular biological techniques to study effects of growth factors, oncogenes, and inhibitors, intracellular events during G1 that lead to DNA synthesis are rapidly being discovered. Many cells in vivo are in a quiescent state (G0), with unduplicated DNA. Cells can be activated to reenter the cycle during G1. Similarly, cells in culture can be shifted between G0 and G1. These switches in and out of G1 are the main determinants of post-embryonic cell proliferation rate and are defectively controlled in cancer cells.\r"

In the last few years there have been major advances in understanding eukaryotic chromosome replication. Patterns of replication origins have been mapped accurately in yeast chromosomes. Cellular replication proteins have been identified by fractionating cell extracts that replicate viral DNA templates in vitro. Cell-free systems that initiate eukaryotic DNA replication in vitro have demonstrated the importance of complex nuclear architecture in the control of DNA replication. Although the events of S phase were relatively neglected for many years, knowledge of DNA replication is now advancing rapidly in step with other phases of the cell cycle.\r"

In eukaryotes, for example, mitosis is dependent on the completion of DNA synthesis. Some dependencies can be relieved by mutation (mitosis may then occur before completion of DNA synthesis), suggesting that the dependency is due to a control mechanism and not an intrinsic feature of the events themselves. Control mechanisms enforcing dependency in the cell cycle are here called checkpoints. Elimination of checkpoints may result in cell death, infidelity in the distribution of chromosomes or other organelles, or increased susceptibility to environmental perturbations such as DNA damaging agents. It appears that some checkpoints are eliminated during the early embryonic development of some organisms; this fact may pose special problems for the fidelity of embryonic cell division.\r"

As development progresses, the mechanisms controlling this trigger change. Early divisions are executed by maternally synthesized gene products, and in Xenopus they are timed by the accumulation and periodic degradation of cyclin, a trigger component. Later, the zygotic genome assumes control, and in Drosophila, zygotic transcription is required for production of another trigger protein, the product of string. After this transition to zygotic control, pulses of string transcription define the timing of highly patterned embryonic cell divisions and cyclin accumulation is not rate limiting.\r"

The degree of divergence is clearly related to the level of gene expression, reflecting constraints on synonymous codon choice. However, where this constraint is weak, among genes not expressed at high levels, divergence is also related to the chromosomal location of the gene; it appears that genes furthest away from oriC, the origin of replication, have a mutation rate approximately two times that of genes near oriC.\r"

NMDA receptors are voltage-sensitive, thus background activation of these receptors imparts a regenerative electrical property to pyramidal cells, which facilitates the coupling between dendritic excitatory synaptic input and somatic action potential discharge in these neurons.\r"

It is assembled from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a large hydrophilic glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which is homologous to the protease zymogen plasminogen. Plasma Lp(a) concentrations vary 1000-fold between individuals and represent a continuous quantitative genetic trait with a skewed distribution in Caucasian populations. Variation in the hypervariable apo(a) gene on chromosome 6q2.6-q2.7 and interaction of apo(a) alleles with defective LDL-receptor genes explain a large fraction of the variability of plasma Lp(a) concentrations. Though of high theoretical and practical interest, many aspects of the metabolism, function, evolution, and regulation of plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are presently unknown, controversial, or mysterious.\r"

It has been proposed that these proteins bind DNA via a bipartite structural motif, consisting of a dimerization interface termed the \"leucine zipper\" and a DNA contact surface termed the \"basic region.\" An evaluation of the properties of conserved amino acids within the basic region of 11 deduced protein sequences, coupled with the observation that they are located at an invariant distance from the leucine zipper, has led to the formulation of a \"scissors-grip\" model for DNA binding. The architectural features of this model are well suited for interaction with directly abutted, dyadsymmetric DNA sequences. Data supportive of the model were obtained with chemical probes of protein: DNA complexes.\r"

The C/EBP protein binds avidly to the dyad symmetric sequence 5'-ATTGCGCAAT-3'; GCN4 regulates the transcription of genes that control amino acid biosynthesis in yeast, and binds avidly to the dyad symmetric sequence 5'-ATGA(G/C)TCAT-3'. Both C/EBP and GCN4 bind DNA via the same structural motif. This motif has been predicted to be bipartite, consisting of a dimerization interface termed the \"leucine zipper\" and a DNA contact surface termed the \"basic region.\" Specificity of DNA binding has been predicted to be imparted by the basic region. As a test of this hypothesis, recombinant proteins were created wherein the basic regions and leucine zippers of GCN4 and C/EBP were reciprocally exchanged. In both of the recombinant polypeptides, DNA binding specificity is shown to track with the basic region.\r"

The joint requirement of BAS1 and BAS2 for activation is probably not due to cooperative binding or the transcriptional control of one of the genes by the other. Although BAS1 and BAS2 were both required for activation of HIS4 transcription, BAS1 was not required for BAS2-dependent expression of the secreted acid phosphatases. The transcriptional activators of HIS4 have DNA binding domains that are conserved in evolution (BAS1 = Myb, BAS2 = homeo box, GCN4 = Jun). Their interactions, therefore, may be relevant to the control of gene expression in more complex systems.\r"

The scaphoid is less susceptible to fracture during the phase when it is mostly cartilaginous, thus making scaphoid fracture rare in childhood.

Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 43 (13 per cent) of the peritoneal specimens, aerobic bacteria alone in 38 (11 per cent) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 258 (76 per cent). A total of 985 bacterial isolates were recovered in peritoneal specimens (2.9 per specimen), with 436 aerobes (1.3 per specimen) and 549 anaerobes (1.6 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 13 (16 per cent) of 83 specimens from abdominal abscesses, aerobes alone in two (2 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (82 per cent). A total of 235 bacterial isolates were recovered in abdominal abscesses--128 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 107 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 11 (12 per cent) of 89 specimens from abdominal wounds, aerobic only in ten (11 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (76 per cent). A total of 258 isolates were recovered (2.9 per specimen)--137 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 121 aerobes or facultatives (1.4 per specimen). The predominant aerobes and facultatives in abdominal infections were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus species. The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium species. Recovered were 334 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group--222 in peritoneal cultures, 63 in abscesses and 49 in wounds. Of the B. fragilis group, B. fragilis accounted for 129 (58 per cent) of isolates in peritoneal aspirates, 45 (75 per cent) in aspirates from abscesses and 30 (61 per cent) in wounds. Results from this study demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic cause and importance of all members of the B. fragilis group in intra-abdominal postsurgical infections.\r"

Shock, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia and uremia were more common in those patients in group 2 (p less than 0.05). The over-all diagnostic effectiveness was 94 per cent. The mortality rate was 4.1 per cent (n = 4). There were no significant differences in morbidity and mortality between both groups. In conclusion, advanced age is not a contraindication for early surgical treatment of acute cholecystitis.\r"

  ".U": "90049630\r", 
  ".W": "Because wound infection is a major cause of incisional hernia, the question posed is whether or not repairs of incisional hernias are at a higher risk for wound infection also. To answer this, we analyzed the incidence of wound infection after repair of incisional hernias during a 30 month period and compared it with the infection rate in all other clean procedures performed during the same period. All repairs of incisional hernias were performed upon patients with completely healed incisions without clinical signs of infection. Patients undergoing concomitant procedures upon the gastrointestinal tract were excluded. During the 30 month period, 995 clean operations were performed. In the 80 repairs of incisional hernias, there were 13 infections proved by culture, yielding an over-all infection rate of 16 per cent. In the remaining 915 clean procedures, there were 14 wound infections (1.5 per cent, p less than 0.0001). Of these 915 clean operations, 241 were repairs of inguinal hernias. Two infections occurred in this subgroup (0.8 per cent, p less than 0.0001, compared with repairs of incisional hernias). In patients undergoing repairs of incisional hernias with previously documented wound infections, 41 per cent had infected repairs. By comparison, only 12 per cent of patients without a prior infection had infections develop in the hernial repair (p less than 0.05). The infection rate for patients not receiving prophylactic antibiotics (21 per cent) was almost twice the rate for those receiving antibiotics (11 per cent), p = 0.07. We concluded that repair of incisional hernias has a significantly higher rate of infection than do other clean general surgical procedures. Herniorrhaphy of a wound that was previously infected is at a higher risk for reinfection, despite complete healing of the skin and absence of clinical signs of infection. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be indicated, but randomized studies are needed. For reporting and surveillance purposes, repairs of incisional hernias should not be classified as clean surgical procedures.\r"

Five patients with adenomas of the papilla, presenting with obstructive jaundice, underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy with reversal of hepatic biochemistry to normal. Thereafter, four patients underwent local surgical excision. The adenoma recurred in all four patients within six to 18 months after the operation. The recurrent adenomas were eradicated by diathermic fulguration through the endoscope and were not found during a 12 to 24 month follow-up period. Snare polypectomy was performed upon one patient (who refused surgical treatment) who had a flat, broad-based adenoma, with an incomplete resection of the adenoma. This patient had adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas develop 40 months later. We conclude that endoscopic sphincterotomy is effective for biliary decompression of adenoma of the papilla of Vater presenting with acute obstructive jaundice. Endoscopic snare polypectomy of the adenoma combined with fulguration may be used as an alternative to surgical treatment in high risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "Renovascular hypertension is caused by renovascular disease and it can be potentially cured by ablative or reconstructive operation or PTA. The incidence of renovascular hypertension is 1 to 2 per cent among nonselected hypertensive patients. Renovascular disease in hypertensive patients is progressive in 20 to 40 per cent. The diagnosis of renovascular hypertension can only be made retrospectively after successful intervention. The accuracy of all tests for the determination of the functional significance of a stenosis before intervention remains limited. It has been demonstrated that medical therapy, reconstructive surgical treatment and PTA each can effectively lower high blood pressure. Although medical therapy has been considerably improved because of the development of new drugs, it should be recognized that medical management does not prevent the natural progression of renovascular disease. Therefore, renovascular hypertension is best treated by correction of the underlying renal arterial stenosis. Improvements in surgical management include improved selection of patients for surgical treatment, increased beneficial blood pressure response rates in 70 to 95 per cent of the patients and decreased surgical mortality rates of less than 5 per cent. The anatomic failure rates have been reduced because of the increase in surgical expertise, the use of autologous materials for bypass, the avoidance of combined procedures in the event of concomitant aortoiliac disease, the use of extra-anatomic reconstructions when appropriate and the introduction of extra-corporeal reconstruction and autotransplantation. PTA has evolved as a relatively safe and effective method in the treatment of renovascular hypertension. However, complications do occur and orificial arteriosclerotic lesions and renal arterial branch lesions should not be considered for angioplasty. At present, the question of whether renovascular surgical treatment or PTA should be the treatment of choice cannot be answered completely. Treatment of renovascular hypertension should be accommodated to each patient.\r"

  ".W": "In 1978, a prospective program was initiated to evaluate postoperative monitoring of patients after resection of carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The program included clinical examination, interval endoscopy, measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), selected liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase) and roentgenologic testing: roentgenograms of the chest, barium enema, intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and computerized axial tomographic (CAT) scan. Of the initial 226 patients enrolled, 179 had at least one abnormal elevation of the CEA level, and in 70 (39 per cent), recurrence developed. Of the 70 with recurrence, 62 (89 per cent) had elevated CEA levels (greater than 3.0 nanograms per milliliter) prior to detection of recurrence by other means. Eight patients had normal levels (two were false-negative and the other six were tested at inappropriate times). Although other test results often complemented CEA, they were generally less sensitive for early detection. Selective use of these tests frequently documented site and extent of recurrence. The detection sensitivity of these other tests was highest with CAT scan (83 per cent), followed by barium enema and endoscopy (56 and 46 per cent). Forty-five patients underwent re-exploration. Recurrence was found in 42, of whom 23 had resectable disease (five of 11, liver; 17 of 24, local or pelvis, and one of one, lung). In three patients, nothing abnormal was found at exploration; two of these patients ultimately had metastases develop. The median survival time was 43 months and the estimated five year survival rate was 38 per cent. CEA is the best over-all indicator of early recurrence and frequent testing at short intervals is most important. Periodic clinical examination and selected other studies are also essential for early documentation of recurrence. Second-look surgical procedures appear beneficial for survival time in selected patients.\r"

Withdrawal of blood was consistently successful in 91 per cent of the systems. Complication rates for infection and thrombosis were 0.04 and 0.03 per 100 days of catheterization, respectively. No episodes of migration of the catheter or embolization were noted. This was thought to be the result of the placement of all catheters by a cutdown technique rather than percutaneously. Five systems were removed because of thrombosis and 22, because of infection. Implantable venous access devices are reliable and have a low complication rate in adult and pediatric patients who require repetitive venous access.\r"

It is now commonly used to drain other organs, mainly the biliary system, and in various remedial operations for complications from gastrectomy. Conversion to RYA is efficacious for the treatment of inflammation of the stomach and esophagus caused by alkaline reflux. The main complication of RYA is Roux Y syndrome, secondary to gastric or efferent jejunal stasis, or both. Peptic ulceration is much less a problem since the advent of vagotomy. Better understanding of the physiologic characteristics of various forms of RYA should soon better define the limits of its clinical application.\r"

Afferent nervous stimuli, stimuli from the central nervous system, local wound factors and endocrine changes characterized by increases in stress hormones are some of these responses. Molecular biology has launched us into an age in which the categorization of these neuroendocrine changes will be broadened to include the profound effects of previously unidentified molecules. TNF and IL-1 are two protein hormones of the cytokine family. TNF causes hemorrhagic necrosis of solid tumors, mediates the lethal effects of endotoxemia and induces immune metabolic and intercellular changes. IL-1 is a mediator of inflammation and the acute phase response. The diversity of actions of TNF and IL-1 appear to be results of their multiple forms (alpha and beta) and their abilities to act both as membrane-associated and free proteins, to act locally (paracrine) as well as systemically, to act synergistically and to be involved in complex webs of self-promotion and amplification. On the basis of these diverse capabilities, they are prime candidates to be mediators of common surgical disease.\r"

  ".W": "The standard stainless steel Greenfield filter (SGF) requires a 24F-sized carrier system, and its insertion percutaneously has been associated with local venous thrombosis. To facilitate both percutaneous and operative insertion, a titanium model of the Greenfield filter (TGF) has been developed that allows use of a 12F-sized carrier system. Mechanical comparison of the SGF and TGF devices shows that both withstand extensive flexion stress, but the TGF has greater endurance (52 gm at 20 mm travel) than the SGF (48 gm at 5 mm travel). Measurement of lateral forces for fixation shows comparable force (4.5 gm) at 22 mm for each device but greater force for the TGF at diameters more than 22 mm to its resting diameter of 38 mm. The TGF also withstands crevice corrosion in hydrochloric acid and ferric chloride better than the SGF. Animal studies in 20 sheep show comparable fixation of both devices with no added thrombogenicity of the TGF. Thrombus capture and resolution studies after 14 days in dogs show comparable effectiveness, and histologic examination of the venae cavae show similar inflammatory cell reaction and fibrosis with no foreign body reaction for either metal. Both the SGF and the TGF demonstrate durability and effective filtration of thrombi, with the TGF having the added advantages of ease of insertion and potential improved fixation in larger cavae.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free and overall survival was studied in 812 patients with stages I and II breast cancer, followed up prospectively in a multicenter study. All patients initially underwent a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with axillary node-negative, stage I cancer were followed up without additional therapy. Patients with axillary node-positive, stage II cancer were randomized to receive adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy. Transfusion was done in 35.8% of the patients with stage I and in 37.3% of the patients with stage II cancer. For the patients with stage II cancer, perioperative blood transfusion did not affect disease-free or overall survival. For the patients with stage I cancer, perioperative blood transfusion resulted in a worse disease-free and overall survival (p = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively), which was particularly evident for those patients who received more than 1 unit. This study suggests that stage of disease, adjuvant therapy, number of transfusions, and duration of follow-up must be considered in further analyses.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective evaluation of the accuracy of preoperative computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and angiography was performed in 54 patients undergoing resection of hepatic neoplasms. The results were compared with surgical findings and intraoperative ultrasonography (IOUS). A total of 167 lesions was seen by means of IOUS, of which preoperative US enabled detection of 127 (76%). In 48 patients CT allowed detection of 91 of 150 lesions (61%), and in 35 patients angiography showed 56 of 107 lesions (52%). When the detection rate is analyzed according to hepatic segment, the greater overall accuracy of preoperative US may be attributed to a markedly better detection rate in lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver. Lesion size also represented a factor, with preoperative US allowing detection of a greater number of small (less than 2 cm) lesions compared with CT. In patients studied with both CT and US, the combined lesion-detection rate increased to 81% in the right lobe and 76% in the left lobe. Because of this we recommend that preoperative assessment include both CT and US evaluation of the liver. IOUS showed 25% to 35% additional lesions compared with preoperative US and CT. More importantly, 40% of the lesions demonstrated by IOUS were neither visible nor palpable at surgery. We recommend that IOUS be considered in all patients in whom resection of hepatic neoplasm is planned.\r"

  ".W": "A 60% partial pancreatectomy or a sham operation was performed in adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. Measurements of pancreatic blood flow (PBF) and islet blood flow (IBF) were achieved by a microsphere technique either before surgery or 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 weeks after the operation. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (2 gm glucose/kg body weight) was made 2 days before the blood flow measurements. There were no aberrations in glucose homeostasis at any time point after the partial pancreatectomy. The sham-operated animals had both PBF and IBF values similar to those of nonoperated animals at all time points. The rats that underwent partial pancreatectomy, however, showed significantly increased PBF values 2 and 4 weeks after surgery but values similar to those of the sham-operated rats 1, 8, and 16 weeks after surgery. The IBF values of the animals that underwent pancreatectomy were significantly increased from week 2 onward when expressed per gram of pancreas and from week 4 onward when expressed as a fraction of PBF. Compared with the sham-operated animals, the total blood perfusion of the islet organ was increased in the rats that underwent partial pancreatectomy despite a reduction in total pancreatic mass. It is concluded that a partial pancreatectomy induces both a transient increase in PBF and a more long-lasting increase in IBF. It is conceivable that these observations reflect the regeneration of exocrine and endocrine cells and an increased functional load on these tissues.\r"

All soft tissue was removed from the fascia of 12 abdominal walls that were cut into 346 test sections. A single suture loop was placed in each section, simulating laparotomy closure with interrupted technique. Suture bite size (0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 cm) and gauge (00, 0, 1, and 2) were randomly assigned. The force and energy required to pull out suture loops were measured. Mean linea alba thickness was greater above the linea semicircularis than below (1.19 vs 0.77 mm; p less than 0.001). Similarly, mean pullout force was greater above the linea semicircularis (58.2 vs 31.6 N; p less than 0.001). Regression analysis found that fascial thickness and bite size accounted for 68% of observed variability in pullout force. Suture diameter was unrelated to pullout force. Optimum security was obtained with bites of at least 1.2 to 1.5 cm.\r"

Although intestinal ischemia caused by emboli is not uncommon, intestinal ischemia resulting from metastatic tumor emboli occurs in only a small percentage of cases. We suggest that surgeons include the possibility of tumor emboli in the differential diagnosis for mesenteric or peripheral ischemia that cannot be attributed to more common causes.\r"

Type II is due to an immune-mediated platelet aggregation caused by IgG and IgM that becomes bound to platelets. In Type II, the antibody titers decline over several months; however, early reexposure can result in a catastrophic secondary immune response. Frequently, Type II is associated with life- or limb-threatening thromboembolic complications (white clots), including stroke.\r"

The middle cerebral artery territory was affected in nine patients (90%), with moderate-sized or large infarcts by clinical and computed tomographic criteria. The interval between stroke onset and intracerebral hemorrhage was less than 72 hours in 80% of the patients. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred less than or equal to 24 hours after the time heparin was started in 80% of the patients. The activated partial thromboplastin time closest to the time of intracerebral hemorrhage was greater than 2 x control in seven patients. Our findings in the 10 patients are similar to those of the 16 cases previously reported and suggest that heparin-related intracerebral hemorrhage occurs early after stroke onset, usually with moderate-sized or large infarcts, and with excessive anticoagulation in some patients.\r"

Basilar artery caliber was angiographically measured under anesthesia before (control) and after either vertebral artery infusion or cisternal injection of the peptide. In cats, 5-500 pmol endothelin induced a dose-dependent basilar artery contraction in vivo when injected intracisternally; within 3 minutes after injection of 500 pmol endothelin, basilar artery caliber was decreased by 73 +/- 4% compared with control diameter before injection. The vasoconstriction was extremely long-lasting; no significant recovery of basilar artery caliber was observed for up to 2 hours after injection. In contrast, infusion of up to 3,000 pmol endothelin into the vertebral artery had no appreciable effect on basilar artery caliber. Similar results were obtained in dogs; vasoconstriction was maintained for as long as 12 hours. Our observations suggest that endothelin acts in cerebral vessels from the adventitial side, not from the luminal side, possibly due to the presence of the blood-arterial wall barrier. The long-lasting nature of endothelin-induced constriction of the cerebral arteries in vivo suggests that the peptide might be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

Early clinical detection of carotid paragangliomas is difficult since these lesions often occur sporadically and the patients remain symptom-free until the tumor becomes noticeable. Doppler color flow imaging allows the diagnosis of even small paragangliomas, which may improve management because of existing complications of surgical therapy.\r"

Studies of the pathology of prostate cancer found at autopsy or in the clinic, the natural history of the disease, and the results of treatment trials leave little room for doubt that large cancers, particularly those that are not well differentiated or that invade outside of the prostate, will prove lethal if not effectively treated. We do not know whether some small prostate cancers are potentially dangerous. Perhaps studies of nuclear features, DNA content, or oncogene expression will be able to distinguish the potentially lethal small cancers from the truly \"latent\" small cancers. We do, however, have strong evidence that every big cancer is dangerous. Autopsy studies have established that there are not two forms of prostate cancer, but one. Initial malignant transformation in the prostate produces an adenocarcinoma histologically indistinguishable from any other prostate cancer. However, a promoter seems to be necessary to activate the tumor and allow it to express its malignant potential. The strong correlation between the prevalence of large, proliferative cancers found at autopsy and the clinical incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer in populations around the world strongly supports the concept of a multistep process in the pathogenesis of the disease. If McNeal's detailed volumetric studies are accurate, then we can estimate the proportion of \"autopsy\" cancers that are large enough to threaten the life and well-being of their host. This proportion appears to be about 20 per cent, and these are the undetected but \"clinically important\" cancers. The dilemma of prostate cancer becomes less puzzling when viewed in this light. In a daunting display of the power of the paradox of prostate cancer, Chodak estimated that if every cancer present in American men were to be found and treated, 75,000 men would die from the treatment, whereas less than 30,000 are expected to die of the disease this year! But this paradox can be explained by introducing time into the analysis, basing estimates on the lifetime risks rather than the annual incidence. For a 50-year-old man, the lifetime risk of developing cancer in the prostate is about 42 per cent, the risk of developing the disease clinically is 9.5 per cent, and the risk of dying from the disease is 2.9 per cent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Over the next 10 years, prostate cancer will be the cause of death in a large number of men. Perhaps the most feasible approach to reducing this mortality is early detection. The initial studies with transrectal ultrasonography demonstrate that this test is capable of detecting prostate cancers that are not detected by the digital rectal examination. A reasonable conclusion from these data is that every man over age 50 should have a sonogram as part of his annual check-up. Unfortunately, routine screening may also lead to serious morbidity, yet it may not lower the mortality rate from this disease. Therefore, before screening is recommended, randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of routine sonograms on asymptomatic men. These trials will be costly and time-consuming, but worthwhile, as the variable biology of this tumor means that screening may not accomplish its stated goals. That is, it is entirely possible that life-threatening tumors will not be detected by screening in time to alter the outcome, whereas many of the potentially curable tumors that are diagnosed and treated would never have caused a man's death. The initial results with screening by ultrasonography are encouraging, however. Therefore, further studies should be pursued because of the potential benefit if screening by ultrasonography proves effective.\r"

Two areas where the capsule is deficient have been described: the invaginated extraprostatic space and the apex of the prostate, both of which are easy avenues along which tumor may escape the confines of the prostate. Cancer of the prostate is hypoechoic in comparison with the normal peripheral zone tissue in all cases and can be diagnosed with great accuracy by the use of ultrasound-guided biopsies. The sensitivity of transrectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer is twice that of digital rectal examination. In our clinical study, the overall positive predictive value of a hypoechoic lesion was 41 per cent, and it increased to 61 per cent when combined with the finding of a positive digital rectal examination and to 52 per cent if the prostate-specific antigen level was elevated. Thirty-two per cent of the cancers diagnosed with transrectal ultrasound were not detectable by digital rectal examinations.\r"

Rarely, we have seen a cancer that was predominantly hyperechoic. Other signs of disturbance of the normal internal anatomy of the prostate may suggest the diagnosis of prostate cancer and are particularly valuable in assessing patients with more advanced disease. Approximately one third of early-stage cancers detected by palpation or transurethral resection are isoechoic. These tumors are anteriorly located, small, and well differentiated and infiltrate among normal glands or are composed of malignant glands similar in size to normal acini. Not all hypoechoic areas within the prostate are cancer; both normal anatomic structures and various benign conditions may appear less echogenic than the normal prostatic parenchyma. A comprehensive understanding of normal prostatic anatomy and the morphology of prostate cancer is essential to the accurate interpretation of the sonogram. Precise interpretation of prostatic sonograms requires detailed correlations of high-quality images with pathologic examinations of the whole prostate. The development of accurate criteria for the sonographic diagnosis of both malignant and benign prostatic diseases can be achieved only by such studies. As the possibilities and limitations of transrectal ultrasonography become apparent from pathologic correlation, the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis of prostate cancer will be placed on a more rational basis.\r"

When transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy of a palpable hypoechoic abnormality is negative for cancer, digitally guided biopsy must subsequently be performed. In some cases, palpable abnormality may not be seen on ultrasound. We advocate the use of our biopsy procedure as an integral extension of transrectal ultrasound of the prostate. In an outpatient setting, biopsy may be performed immediately after finding a suspect lesion on ultrasound. In this way, patients are spared time and anxiety, and society is spared medical costs.\r"

Traditionally, staging of prostate cancer has relied on the digital rectal examination, but ultrasonography, which provides an unprecedented picture of the gland, has become a valuable adjunct. The overall sonographic pattern helps to classify a tumor as \"localized\" or \"extensive.\" A more detailed analysis yields information about the volume and location of the primary tumor; the presence, location, and extent of extracapsular extension; and the presence of seminal vesicle invasion. Comparison of sonograms with corresponding sections of radical prostatectomy specimens demonstrates that ultrasound complements the digital examination in determining by clinical tests the pathologic extent of a cancer.\r"

Changes in the echo pattern of the gland may be observed following treatment, but these may be difficult to interpret. The capsule may be restored; the tumor may appear smaller, and in some cases, ultrasound identification of the tumor may become impossible. The total gland volume decreases with chemotherapy and hormonal manipulation (subcapsular orchidectomy or drug-induced). The volume generally decreases after radiotherapy but may show a transient increase if there is some associated radiation proctitis. The rate of decrease of total prostatic volume has not been established as a reliable indicator of the subsequent prognosis. Future studies should assess whether sequential measurements of the tumor volume rather than the total prostatic volume may be a more useful guide to prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "As treatments for early localized prostate cancer come under closer scrutiny, the fundamental problem of documenting the success of radiotherapy becomes more obvious. Currently, no satisfactory method exists to determine tumor viability after radiotherapy. Transrectal ultrasonography is particularly valuable for monitoring the response of prostate cancer to radiotherapy. Persistent cancer retains its hypoechoic appearance after definitive radiotherapy. Hypoechoic lesions greater than 5 mm in diameter found more than 12 months after radiotherapy should be suspected of representing persistent local disease. In our study, albeit in a selected group of patients undergoing salvage radical prostatectomy, 92 per cent of such findings were associated with what we interpreted as viable tumor by light microscopy. Ultrasound-guided biopsy should be considered in such circumstances. The persistence of hypoechoic lesions in more than 65 per cent of patients 12 to 36 months after radiotherapy also suggests that local treatment failure may be underestimated by digital rectal examination and random digitally guided biopsy. Serial measurement of the diameter of hypoechoic lesions may provide a valuable indicator of progress in an individual patient. Patients with enlarging foci of tumor within the prostate after radiotherapy might be selected for biopsy and further treatment. If such a policy is employed, it is likely that a higher incidence of persistent cancer will be found after radiotherapy than has previously been discovered by random digitally guided biopsy.\r"

The complications of seed implantation are those associated with the radiation rather than with the technique of implantation. However, radiotherapy has not provided impressive local control of the disease or prolonged survival. The poor disease control was not attributed to poor seed placement, but rather to the inadequacy of 125I in controlling the cancer. The essence of nonsurgical treatment for prostate cancer is the use of effective imaging. Experience in the field of minimally invasive surgery has shown that ultrasound is the ideal imaging system for targeting treatments because of its ease of use and the absence of adverse effects. As the newer techniques of implantation come to be accepted, it is hoped that the complications of rectal and bladder radiation injury will decrease and the therapeutic benefits increase. The clinical trials required to define the precise role of each of the modalities of treatment must take nodal staging into account and must be compared with the gold standard of radical prostatectomy in the treatment of early confined disease.\r"

  ".W": "Transrectal prostatic ultrasound is a minimally invasive, painless investigation that provides objective data on the topography of the prostate. Prostatitis is a condition difficult to diagnose in view of its varied symptomatology and lack of physical signs. The diagnosis currently rests on the finding of excessive numbers of leukocytes in the prostatic secretion obtained during the Stamey localization procedure. Seven ultrasound features having a significant correlation with a diagnosis of prostatitis have been identified: high-density and mid-range echoes, echo-lucent zones, capsular irregularity and thickening, ejaculatory duct echoes, and periurethral-zone irregularity. Ultrasonography confirms the focal nature and frequent peripheral-zone location of inflammatory prostate disease. Follow-up ultrasound studies over a short period showed that the echo-lucent zones may resolve to normal, mid-range, or high-density echoes in conjunction with a fall in the leukocyte count in expressed prostatic secretions. The ability to place a biopsy needle accurately under ultrasound control has enabled histologic assessment of the parenchymal features. The high-density echoes represent corpora amylacea; the mid-range echoes, inflammation, fibrosis, or both; and the echo-lucent zones, inflammation. The low specificity of mid-range and high-density echoes (51.9 and 40.7 per cent) and the low sensitivity (range 30.8 to 62.3 per cent) of the remaining five ultrasound features of prostatitis preclude identification of any one feature as being diagnostic of this condition. A possible exception may be the finding of echo-lucent zones, which may also prove useful in the monitoring of response to treatment. The detection of several signs within an individual's prostate suggests a diagnosis of chronic prostatitis, whereas a normal scan in a patient with symptoms of prostatitis is highly suggestive of prostatodynia.\r"

All patients were studied before achieving full erection after papaverine injection. In the flaccid state, the inner diameter of the deep penile arteries averaged 0.51 mm, and blood flow velocity was rarely measurable. The normal arterial reaction to papaverine was an initial increase in the inner diameter of the scanned segment of the cavernous artery with good concentric pulsations and a mean peak blood flow velocity of 34.8 cm per second and a mean diameter of 0.89 mm. With this technique, we assessed the functional capability of each deep and dorsal artery. Arterial and erectile response allowed indirect evaluation of the venous system. Of the 657 patients, 48 had neurogenic or psychogenic impotence or both. In 97, impotence could be ascribed to venogenic causes, in 210 to arteriogenic causes, and to mixed arteriogenic and venogenic causes in 282 patients. The exact cause of impotence in the remaining 20 patients could not be determined.

Stones of any size or composition were treated. All stones apart from those situated in the area hidden by the pelvic bones could be localized by ultrasound. Focusing of the shock waves on stones located inside the kidney is as easy, fast, and safe as using an x-ray location system. Ureteral stones treated in situ accounted for 10 per cent of all treatments. The disadvantage of needing more time and experience to identify ureteral stones with ultrasound-guided localization is minor compared to the advantage of no x-ray exposure and the possibility of a continuous visual control of lithotripsy. At our hospital, the \"old\" x-ray-guided lithotripsy system (Dornier HM3) is used only in the rare cases of ureteral stones located in \"no man's land\" that cannot be pushed back or moved a little more toward the urinary bladder. In addition to the benefits of stone location by ultrasound, it is possible to detect urinary obstruction and dilatation of the collecting system more easily and effectively than by the use of radiographic contrast material. Renal ultrasonography must be considered an optimal technique in the management of calculus disease by lithotripsy.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasound has proved to be very accurate in evaluating children with common urologic problems such as renal obstruction and urinary infection and in screening for uropathology among children with siblings known to have urologic disease. The benefits of ultrasound in a pediatric population include diagnostic accuracy, ease of use, absence of radiation exposure, and no risk of adverse reactions to contrast agents. As a consequence, ultrasound has become routine in the evaluation of children with urologic conditions, and its use has been expanded to screening of healthy infants for urinary tract abnormalities. One (1.3 per cent) of 73 otherwise-healthy babies studied had urologic problems severe enough to warrant surgery. Steinhart and associates recommended the routine use of ultrasound in healthy infants, because a significant number of infants harbor silent urinary tract abnormalities that can be detected by ultrasound at a low cost. Obstetricians and other primary-care physicians as well as urologists have incorporated the office use of ultrasound into the care for their patients and thus avoid the inconvenience and difficulties of outside referral. In addition, the clinician as a sonographer occupies a unique position that permits sonographic information to be related directly to the clinical problem. In this review, we have included more than three times the number of patients studied in the initial report. The ease and accuracy of office ultrasound that we described initially have been confirmed by subsequent experience. The urosound examination is indicated for the initial evaluation of patients with voiding symptoms, urine infection, or hematuria, as well as to screen patients with known congenital anomalies, such as hypospadias. Urosound can be employed in the surveillance of children with dysfunctional voiding to measure the completeness of bladder emptying and hydronephrosis. The degree of hydronephrosis in cases of ureteropelvic junction obstruction, megaureters, ectopic ureters, and ureteroceles and that remaining after surgery may be documented by urosound examination. We have found that when the urosound study is abnormal, further diagnostic evaluation is more efficiently planned. Office-based pediatric urologist-operated ultrasound supplements the information elicited from routine history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and other radiologic investigations.\r"

Two cefixime recipients and 3 patients given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had courses that were not evaluable for efficacy. At five to nine days post-therapy, 98 percent of the patients in each treatment group had clinical cure and bacteriologic eradication. At four to six weeks post-therapy, 87 percent (34/39) of the cefixime-treated patients and 83 percent (33/40) of those given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had clinical cure and 90 percent (35/39) and 93 percent (37/40) of the patients in the respective treatment groups had bacteriologic eradication.

  ".W": "Propofol is a 2,6-diisopropylphenol with sedative-hypnotic properties. Because of its slight solubility in water, the drug is formulated as an emulsion for clinical use. It is highly lipophilic and distributes extensively in the body. The blood concentration-time profile of propofol after an iv bolus injection follows a three-compartment model with half-lives of 2-4 min, 30-45 min, and 3-63 h, respectively. Propofol is extensively metabolized by the liver prior to its elimination by the kidney. Following an iv dose of 2-2.5 mg/kg, loss of consciousness occurs in less than one minute and lasts for approximately five minutes. Hypnosis can be maintained by propofol blood concentrations of 1.5-6 micrograms/mL in the presence of N2O/O2 (60:40 ratio) or other anesthetic agents. During induction, propofol decreases the systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 20-30 percent with minimal change in heart rate; apnea is also common. The cardiovascular and respiratory effects of propofol, however, should not cause major concern in otherwise healthy patients. By virtue of its pharmacokinetic profile, the drug lends itself to continuous infusion for maintenance of anesthesia. When used as the main anesthetic agent, it produces satisfactory anesthesia with rapid recovery and without major adverse effects in healthy individuals. In continuous infusion propofol can be used as an alternative to inhalation anesthetics.\r"

Several disorders may cause symptomatic orthostatic hypotension including age-related changes in physiology, disorders of the autonomic nervous system, drugs, and a decrease in circulating blood volume. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a fall in systolic pressure of at least 20-30 mm Hg and a fall in diastolic pressure of at least 10-15 mm Hg upon rising, with symptoms of cerebral ischemia. Management includes a search for reversible causes as well as nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. No single agent has been universally successful in relieving the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Trials of single agents or combinations of agents are needed to identify the most appropriate therapy for individual patients.\r"

Amiodarone has negative inotropic and chronotropic properties as well as peripheral vasodilating properties that may manifest as bradycardia, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These reactions are clinically important during surgery, because of resistance to pharmacologic resuscitation and an increased mortality rate. Potential risk factors include ventricular dysfunction, rapid infusion rate, hypocalcemia, cardiopulmonary bypass, general anesthesia, concurrent negative inotropic or chronotropic drugs, and an elevated serum amiodarone or desethylamiodarone concentration. The following measures may decrease the risk of intraoperative adverse reactions in amiodarone-treated patients. The serum calcium concentration should be at the physiologic level and the serum amiodarone and digoxin concentrations should be in the therapeutic range. Negative inotropic and chronotropic agents should be discontinued when possible. A temporary cardiac pacemaker may prevent intraoperative hypotension due to bradycardia. Amiodarone may be discontinued before surgery to minimize the risk of intraoperative complications, but this decision should balance the potential for amiodarone-associated intraoperative complications against the risk of arrhythmia recurrence and the delay of surgery.\r"

Recent understanding of concentration-dependent bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect argues that the aminoglycosides may be administered in larger doses and at longer dosing intervals than currently recommended without compromising efficacy. Preliminary clinical experience suggests that once-daily regimens are as efficacious as conventional intermittent injections in the treatment of gram-negative infectious including urinary tract infections, cystic fibrosis, and bacteremia in nonneutropenic patients. The transient, high peak serum concentrations achieved in once-daily dosing have not been associated with excessive nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity thus far. Decreased accumulation in renal cortex as a result of saturable renal uptake after the single daily dose may even reduce the incidence or severity of renal damage. Further studies on more patients are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.\r"

Data from the literature indicate that because of its chemical structure famotidine has a much greater potency and affinity for the H2-receptor and a notable lack of drug-drug interactions when compared with ranitidine and cimetidine. As a result, famotidine should be considered the H2-receptor antagonist of choice for critically ill patients who require gastric-acid suppression and at the same time are being treated with other drugs that depend on the cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase system for their metabolism and/or on renal tubular mechanisms for their excretion.\r"

Direct costs include drug cost, labor costs (pharmacy/nursing time), and the materials required for iv administration of these agents. Indirect costs include adverse effects, drug interactions, and allergic reactions. Due to the high percentage of total cost for labor and materials associated with the iv H2-receptor antagonists, a reduction in drug cost, although certainly desired, is unlikely to substantially reduce the amount charged the patient per intravenous dose administered or the daily cost of therapy. However, if less frequent dosing were required to achieve similar therapeutic effects, the daily therapy cost for iv H2-receptor antagonists could be substantially reduced. Assuming that cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are equally effective and safe, our cost analyses at the University of Tennessee Medical Center/William F. Bowld Hospital indicate that famotidine administered q12h, regardless of the iv administration technique used, is the most cost-effective H2-receptor antagonist and is the drug of choice.\r"

As a result of cost considerations, we reviewed the available antiulcer agents in our hospital and evaluated the potential for therapeutic interchange within this group of agents. We found that by using famotidine as the principal agent in our hospital, drug cost savings of approximately $65,000 were realized. Additionally, avoiding the administration of approximately 13,000 parenteral doses with the selection of famotidine resulted in further reduction of drug administration costs. We conclude that the histamine2-receptor antagonists represent a cost-effective target for pharmacy cost-containment programs, without affecting patient therapeutic outcomes.\r"

We conducted a double-blind, parallel-group study in critically ill patients to investigate the comparative safety and acid-suppressant properties of the intravenously administered H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and famotidine. This is a preliminary analysis. Study patients received either famotidine 20 mg q12h or cimetidine 300 mg q6h or q12h. Cimetidine dosing intervals were based upon the degree of renal and hepatic dysfunction due to pharmacokinetic considerations. In critically ill patients with severe renal impairment, a pH of greater than or equal to 4.0 was maintained more consistently with famotidine 20 mg q12h compared with treatment with cimetidine. In terms of safety, a greater number of patients receiving cimetidine reported adverse clinical experiences than those receiving famotidine and a greater number of cimetidine patients had to be withdrawn from the study when compared with famotidine patients. In conclusion, preliminary results of this study suggest that famotidine has superior acid-suppressant properties and a better safety profile when used intravenously for the prevention of SRMD in critically ill patients.\r"

Conventional therapy dictates that the H2-receptor antagonist be given by intermittent intravenous infusion, resulting in peaks and valleys of acid secretory control. Antacids, although capable of providing adequate gastric acidity control, must be administered frequently, often hourly, and thus require excessive nursing time. Presented here is a review of the rationale for the use of an H2-receptor antagonist by continuous infusion.\r"

Measurements of mean peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were obtained from the cavernosal arteries before and after intracavernosal injections of papaverine. Sixty-one patients were examined with dynamic cavernosography and cavernosometry, and 12 patients were studied with selective internal pudendal and penile arteriography. All five patients with abnormal arteriography had mean peak systolic velocities in the cavernosal arteries of less than or equal to 25 cm/sec (sensitivity, 100%; 95% confidence interval, 48-100%) after the injection of papaverine. Six of the seven patients with normal arteriography had mean peak systolic velocities of greater than 25 cm/sec (specificity, 85.7%; 95% confidence interval, 42-100%) after injection of papaverine. By using data from a receiver-operating-characteristic curve, we determined that end-diastolic velocities in the cavernosal arteries of greater than or equal to 5 cm/sec after the injection of papaverine correctly identified patients with excessive venous leakage on cavernosometry; the sensitivity was 90% (95% confidence interval, 77-97%) and the specificity was 56% (95% confidence interval, 30-80%). The addition of color Doppler sonography made the detection of vessels easier and the correction of the Doppler angle more accurate, resulting in more rapid and accurate acquisition of data. Penile duplex sonography with spectral analysis and color Doppler imaging are sensitive and noninvasive means of examining patients with potential vasculogenic impotence.\r"

  ".W": "We used duplex Doppler sonography to assess the hemodynamic function of the penis in patients with impotence to determine if there is arterial disease or if the veins are incompetent. The penis was scanned in the flaccid state, then again after erection was induced by intracorporal injection of papaverine. The diameter of each cavernosal artery was measured before and after injection and, by using Doppler sonography, the maximal systolic velocity in each cavernosal artery was measured. The Doppler gate was placed over the dorsal vein to detect any flow in that vein signifying venous leakage. The Doppler gate then was placed over the cavernosal veins in an attempt to detect cavernosal venous incompetence. Forty-five men with impotence were included in the study. In 39 patients, the cause of impotence was confirmed by other studies. The diameter of the cavernosal arteries and the increase in diameter of these arteries after induction of an erection were similar in all diagnostic groups. The peak systolic velocity, however, was decreased in patients with arterial insufficiency as compared with the velocity in normal subjects. In normal subjects, the mean peak velocity was 47 +/- 9 cm/sec; in patients with mild to moderate arterial insufficiency it was 35 +/- 16 cm/sec; in patients with severe arterial insufficiency it was 7 +/- 8 cm/sec. The difference in peak velocities between the right and left cavernosal arteries after papaverine injection (asymmetric arterial response) was significantly larger in patients with mild to moderate arterial insufficiency than in other diagnostic groups. Four patients with venous incompetence had detectable flow in the dorsal vein, but no flow could be detected with Doppler sonography in the cavernosal veins in any patients, including those who were proved to have significant cavernosal venous leaks. Our findings suggest that Doppler measurement of maximal systolic velocity in the cavernosal arteries after papaverine injection is an accurate indicator of arterial function. Asymmetric flow in the cavernosal arteries also suggests some degree of arterial insufficiency. Diameters of the cavernosal arteries and their increase after injection are not predictive of arterial patency. Doppler sonography cannot show cavernosal venous leakage, but in some cases it can show dorsal venous incompetence.\r"

The relationship of systolic/diastolic velocities and spectral waveform changes in the penile arteries was studied in response to increasing pressure within the corpora cavernosa (tumescence) before and after the intracorporal administration of drugs to induce erection. A characteristic spectral waveform pattern was identified throughout the erectile cycle, and the pattern was correlated with increasing pressure. Both systolic and diastolic velocities were elevated during the initiation of erection, at which time the pressure within the corpora cavernosa was low (11-25 mm Hg). Systolic velocities remained elevated until the last phase of erection (83-106 mm Hg). Diastolic velocity decreased as the intracorporal pressure increased from 25 to 40 mm Hg. Between 40 and 63 mm Hg, diastolic velocity approximated zero. With increasing pressure (63-83 mm Hg), diastolic flow reversed. As the corpora cavernosa approached full erection (83-105 mm Hg), both the forward systolic and reverse diastolic flow components diminished. At approximately 106 mm Hg (systolic occlusion pressure), flow ceased. Systolic/diastolic velocity and waveform phase relationships could be used to define the integrity of both the cavernosal artery inflow and the venous sinusoidal outflow occlusion mechanisms. Color flow Doppler sonography enhanced our ability to observe and quantify dynamic erectile events and provided new insights into understanding normal erectile function.\r"

  ".W": "In seven (18%) of 39 liver transplantation patients, serial Doppler sonographic examinations performed in the first 2 weeks after the transplantation showed transient, highly echogenic nonshadowing particles moving within the portal vein, believed to be portal venous air. This finding was associated with sepsis in one patient, a positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile in another, and postoperative ileus in a third patient. A fourth patient had primary graft failure and required a second transplant. No potential cause was found in the other three patients. None of the patients had bowel infarction or necrosis. The finding was not associated with transplant rejection or graft infection. We conclude that the sonographic finding of portal venous gas is common in the first 2 weeks after hepatic transplantation and may not have grave prognostic significance.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of T1-weighted and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences with T2-weighted phase-contrast (PC) imaging techniques for the detection of hepatic metastases. Pulse-sequences performance was evaluated in 52 consecutive patients with 88 hepatic metastases who underwent MR imaging at 0.6 T. Lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) on SE 260/14 (-12.4 +/- 6.7) and PC 2350/60 (+10.8 +/- 4.2) images were significantly (p less than .05) greater than on SE 2350/60 (+ 7.8 +/- 3.9), SE 2350/120 (+8.1 +/- 4.8), SE 2350/180 (+7.9 +/- 4.5), and PC 2350/30 (+4.6 +/- 2.9) images. Sensitivity for detection of 88 individual metastases was comparable on SE 260/14 (78 of 88 patients) and PC 2350/60 (81 of 88 patients) images and was significantly (p less than .05) greater than on in-phase T2-weighted SE images (TE = 60, 70 of 88 patients; TE = 120, 69 of 88 patients; TE = 180, 65 of 88 patients). Histologic analysis of tumor-free liver showed fatty change in 11 of 13 specimens available for pathologic evaluation. In all 11 of those patients, PC images increased tumor-liver contrast in comparison with the in-phase SE images. This analysis suggests that for detection of hepatic metastases at midfield strengths, the T1-weighted, short TR/short TE (SE 260/14) and the T2-weighted, phase-contrast (PC 2350/60) pulse sequences offer comparable performance.\r"

The procedure was performed on an inpatient basis 70 times and in an outpatient setting 39 times. Colonic, ovarian, and breast carcinomas accounted for over 50% of the tumors resulting in malignant fluid collections. Three complications (hypotension, 2.6%) were directly related to the procedure; two of them were fatal (1.6%). The amount of ascitic fluid drained within the first 24 hr averaged 3.5 l at rates of 100-150 ml/sec. Ninety-five procedures (87%, in 39 patients) resulted in improvement of symptoms after drainage as manifested by decreased pain from abdominal distention, alleviation of nausea, improved appetite, or decreased dyspnea. The duration of symptomatic relief ranged from 4 days to 45 days (mean, 10.4 days). Sonographically guided paracentesis is an effective procedure that can be performed for short-term relief of symptoms caused by malignant ascites.\r"

During leg elevation, despite no significant change in the time constant of isovolumic relaxation (T), the peak rapid filling velocity (PVRF) increased in association with an increase in pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP), but the peak atrial filling velocity was unchanged. The PVRF correlated with the pulmonary wedge V wave - left ventricular minimum pressure difference (r = 0.68) and in multivariate regression with both T and mean PWP (R = 0.73). These results indicate that left ventricular filling is determined by both left ventricular relaxation and left atrial pressure and that an increase in left atrial pressure changes the left ventricular filling velocity profile in a manner that mimics the pattern with normal diastolic function.\r"

The correlation between many hemodynamic parameters and their potential as drug targets was assessed. ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia (ST segment), a parameter often used in exercise tests, also occurs during ambulatory monitoring. Use of the isotope rubidium-82 and positron emission tomography helped confirm the significance of these changes in the ST segment, both painful and silent. Ischemia was detected by a reduction in the uptake of the isotope in a region of the heart reflecting a decrease in myocardial blood flow. Also it was shown that both painful and silent ischemia are caused by similar pathophysiologic mechanisms; such mechanisms include alterations in coronary blood flow and increases in myocardial oxygen demand. Episodes of ST segment depression show a circadian rhythm similar to that seen for heart rate and catecholamine release. The basic pattern shows a low incidence of ischemia at night, followed by a primary peak on rising, a decrease at midday, and then a secondary peak in the evening, with a final decrease again at night. Similar circadian rhythms have been described for acute cardiovascular events, and this may be important for treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia can manifest itself as strictly silent or a combination of symptomatic and silent episodes. We have demonstrated that most asymptomatic patients have a higher threshold for pain than did symptomatic patients. Low sensitivity to pain in patients with silent ischemia may be related to both a neural pain inhibitory system and the release of endogenous opiates, the endorphins. beta-Endorphin release occurs during and after exercise; patients with asymptomatic ischemia had higher plasma beta-endorphin levels than did patients with symptomatic ischemia, especially during exercise. With naloxone treatment, the pain threshold of patients with silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) can be reduced to the same values as those of symptomatic patients. This supports the possibility of a role for endorphins in SMI. Patients who experience both asymptomatic and symptomatic ischemic episodes do so because their pain threshold and endorphin regulatory system varies throughout the day and because severity and duration of ischemic episodes are different. Although there is controversy over the appropriate therapy for SMI, it is more likely that this should simply be treated in the same way as painful ischemia.\r"

  ".U": "90053195\r", 
  ".W": "Calcium antagonists are often prescribed for treatment of ischemic heart disease. Therapeutic activity is achieved by reducing myocardial oxygen requirements and by increasing blood supply in ischemic heart disease associated with coronary artery spasms. The efficacy of calcium antagonists depends on the type and clinical presentation of ischemic heart disease: (1) in vasospastic angina (variant angina, short episodes of angina at rest), first-line therapy with calcium antagonists will reduce the number of ischemic episodes and improve long-term prognosis. (2) In effort angina the efficacy of calcium antagonists is comparable with that of beta blockers. (3) In unstable angina the use of calcium antagonists is controversial. Large-scale studies with nifedipine showed no benefit when it was given alone but an additive effect in patients pretreated with beta blockers. In contrast, diltiazem and verapamil appear to have comparable efficacy to beta blockers in patients with unstable angina. (4) After myocardial infarction the results of treatment with calcium antagonists have been disappointing. Nifedipine and verapamil did not reduce mortality or the incidence of reinfarction. In one study diltiazem significantly reduced the rate of reinfarction in patients who had had a non-Q wave infarction, but in a recent large-scale multicenter trial it had no effect on mortality and cardiac events in patients with evidence of both Q- and non-Q wave infarctions. Other secondary preventative measures against reinfarction, such as the use of beta-blockers and aspirin, appear to be more effective than calcium antagonists. The most frequently prescribed calcium antagonists, verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine, each of which represents a different chemical class, have in general similar efficacy in vasospastic and effort angina. Their different pharmacologic profile, such as the slowing of heart rate with verapamil or diltiazem and a more marked vasodilatation with nifedipine and other dihydropyridines, may become clinically relevant in individual patients. The new dihydropyridine derivatives have a pharmacologic profile comparable to that of nifedipine but some of these compounds, especially amlodipine, have more favorable pharmacokinetics, such as a prolonged elimination half-life. These agents may offer the advantage of a more practical dosage regimen for long-term treatment in patients with ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was synthesized in an attempt to develop a compound with a pharmacokinetic profile characteristic of this class, which would also have an increased oral bioavailability and extended clearance time. A single intravenous dose of 10 mg resulted in an absolute bioavailability of 64% and a calculated elimination half-life of 34 hours. The pharmacokinetic profile of oral doses showed similar changes. These results were significantly different from those seen with most other dihydropyridines (elimination half-life of 3 to 10 hours and absolute bioavailability of 10% to 30%) and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists (elimination half-life 3 to 6 hours and low absolute bioavailability). With chronic oral dosing of amlodipine once daily for 14 days, support was provided for the linearity of amlodipine's pharmacokinetics and absence of such with chronic oral dosing with verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. In the elderly population, elimination half-life of 5 mg oral doses is significantly prolonged (48 vs 35 hours; p less than 0.025) suggesting decreased oral clearance or increased bioavailability. Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris with the profile in healthy volunteers suggested that clearance is not altered in patients with chronic stable angina, steady state being reached 6 to 12 hours after administration of the drug. In patients with cirrhosis, elimination half-life is significantly prolonged (60 vs 34 hours; p less than 0.01) suggesting that there is a greater accumulation of amlodipine in patients with severe liver disease than in individuals with normal hepatic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This data base included 4227 subjects, 2495 of whom received amlodipine (including 2189 who received multiple-dose amlodipine); the remainder received comparative agents (placebo 1213; active comparatives 519). Amlodipine treatment was associated with a slightly higher incidence of side effects compared with placebo, but most of this difference was the result of edema, which was usually well tolerated. When compared with the beta-blockers atenolol and nadolol, amlodipine had a favorable safety profile. In particular, the incidence of severe side effects in patients receiving amlodipine was approximately half that reported for patients receiving beta-blockers. The data base comparing different calcium antagonists was small; in a study versus verapamil, edema was more common in patients receiving amlodipine, but constipation was more common in patients receiving verapamil. In a study versus diltiazem, both amlodipine and diltiazem were similarly well tolerated. Amlodipine was not associated with the deleterious effects of serum creatinine, urate, and fasting glucose, which was caused by hydrochlorothiazide, and in contrast to hydrochlorothiazide and nadolol, amlodipine was not associated with unfavorable changes in serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels. Amlodipine was well tolerated by elderly patients and is not contraindicated in patients with conduction abnormalities. Dosage modifications are unnecessary in renal impairment, but the dosage regimen for patients with hepatic impairment is not yet established. Amlodipine is an antihypertensive and antiischemic agent that has the combined advantages of a good safety profile with once-daily dosage and a smooth onset and long duration of action.\r"

Amlodipine, a new member of this family of dihydropyridines, has a unique pharmacokinetic profile with high bioavailability and an extended period of pharmacodynamic activity. In formal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with exercise tests carried out 24 hours after administration, amlodipine was significantly more effective than the placebo and comparable in efficacy with the calcium antagonist diltiazem and the beta-blocking drug nadolol. In addition to extending exercise capacity in patients with angina pectoris, amlodipine significantly reduces ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia. Amlodipine has also been found to be effective in reducing the anginal attack rate in patients with vasospastic angina. From the evidence available, it is concluded that once-daily treatment with amlodipine in the dose range of 5 to 10 mg is effective in improving exercise capacity and reducing anginal attack rate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and also those with vasospastic angina.\r"

  ".W": "Amlodipine is a potent calcium antagonist, inhibiting Ca2+-induced contractions of depolarized rat aorta with an IC50 of 1.9 nM. Unlike nifedipine, it displayed very slow association and dissociation with the calcium channel. The ability of amlodipine to inhibit Ca2+-induced contractions was strongly dependent on the K+ concentration present before the contraction, suggesting marked voltage dependence of action. Radioligand-binding studies in cardiac membrane preparations suggested that amlodipine may interact directly with both 1,4-dihydropyridine and diltiazem-binding sites on the calcium channel. Hemodynamic studies in anesthetized and conscious dogs showed that amlodipine is a coronary and peripheral vasodilator with a slow onset and long duration of effect, even when given by intravenous injection; the reflex stimulation of cardiac output, heart rate and myocardial contractility induced by amlodipine was attenuated by propranolol, but no marked negative inotropic or dromotropic effects were observed. Amlodipine was an effective oral antihypertensive agent in rat and dog models of hypertension, and its 24-hour duration of action in hypertensive dogs correlated well with its long plasma half-life in this species. The natriuretic properties displayed by amlodipine may contribute to its use as a first-line drug for the treatment of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "All calcium antagonists (CAs) so far developed are vasodilators, and this property is a most important component of their therapeutic potency in hypertension and angina pectoris. At a cellular level, the specific interaction of CAs with transmembranous calcium fluxes involves both potential and receptor-operated channels, respectively. Both alpha 2 and alpha 1 adrenoceptors when activated with an appropriate agonist can trigger the calcium influx through receptor-operated CA channels, alpha 2 adrenoceptors probably more readily so than alpha 1. More recently, angiotensin II receptors have also been demonstrated to be involved, although moderately, in the influx of calcium ions from the extracellular space. The hemodynamic profile of CAs is characterized by a particular specificity for the resistance vessels and for the coronary arterial system, as a useful basis for their therapeutic effect in hypertension and in angina pectoris. The weak natriuretic activity of CAs, probably the result of a tubular effect in the kidney, counteracts the fluid retention to be expected for vasodilator drugs. Interesting ancillary properties of CAs are their potentially favorable effects on the myocardial and vascular hypertrophy associated with long-standing hypertension, as well as their antiatherogenic activity that so far has only been demonstrated in animal models. Such additional properties are of potential benefit and deserve further research, since most large-scale hypertension trials have shown that vasodilatation and the reduction of elevated blood pressure as such, are probably not sufficient to adequately protect hypertensive patients against coronary events.\r"

Calcium antagonists (CAs) lessen the severity of experimentally induced atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed animals. The reduction of aortic cholesterol is one of the most striking findings. This effect is achieved without a reduction of plasma lipid or blood pressure, and is probably related to an interference of CAs with lipid metabolism in the arterial wall. To what extent these properties of CAs are due to their ability to block calcium channels still remains to be addressed. This report briefly discusses the available in vivo and in vitro evidence for the antiatherosclerotic properties of CAs, and outlines the possible mechanisms by which these compounds affect cellular lipid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine on subendocardial segment shortening (%SS), regional myocardial blood flow, myocardial high-energy phosphate levels and tissue water content were compared with those of a saline-treated group of barbital-anesthetized dogs subjected to a 45-minute coronary artery occlusion followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Saline or amlodipine (200 micrograms/kg administered intravenously) was given 15 minutes before coronary occlusion. There were no significant differences between groups in ischemic bed size or hemodynamics although dP/dt was higher after amlodipine administration. Subepicardial collateral blood flow was higher in the amlodipine group during coronary occlusion. After occlusion, %SS in the ischemic region was markedly decreased in both series and passive systolic lengthening resulted. Despite similar decreases in %SS during occlusion, the amlodipine-treated dogs showed a marked improvement in myocardial segment function of the ischemic reperfused region throughout 60 minutes of reperfusion compared with saline-treated dogs. In addition, amlodipine prevented the rebound increase in phosphocreatine and attenuated the loss of adenine nucleotides and increase in tissue water in the ischemic reperfused area at 60 minutes of reperfusion. These results suggest that amlodipine has a favorable effect on the functional and metabolic recovery of the ischemic reperfused myocardium and may have potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of coronary artery disease. The mechanism of action of amlodipine in this model is unknown but may be partially related to a drug-induced increase in coronary collateral blood flow or a decrease in afterload.\r"

The overall probability of AMI among patients with chest pain and initially normal or nonspecific ECGs was 3%, but ranged from less than 1 to 17% depending on the patient's age and sex and whether the patient had pressure-type pain or pain radiating to the shoulder, neck or arms. Among initially admitted patients, the time elapsed between onset of pain and presentation was similar in both groups. However, the time between onset of pain and definitive diagnosis of AMI by enzymes or clinical course was longer in patients with initially normal or nonspecific electrocardiograms (8.3 vs 7.5 hours, p less than 0.05), their peak creatine kinase levels were lower (mean 643 vs 1,032 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and their mortality was slightly lower (6 vs 12%, p = 0.10).

Each method differed in the number of variables considered in the posttest probability estimate (method A = 5, method B = 6 and method C = 15). Method C is better known as CADENZA. There were 436 patients (250 men and 186 women) who underwent stress testing (135 had concurrent thallium scintigraphy) followed within 2 months by coronary arteriography. Coronary artery disease ([CAD], at least 1 vessel with greater than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing) was seen in 169 (38%). Mean pretest probabilities using each method were not different. However, the mean posttest probabilities for CADENZA were significantly greater than those for method A or B (p less than 0.0001). Each decile of posttest probability was compared to the actual prevalence of CAD in that decile. At posttest probabilities less than or equal to 20%, there was underestimation of CAD. However, at posttest probabilities greater than or equal to 60%, there was overestimation of CAD by all methods, especially CADENZA. Comparison of sensitivity and specificity at every fifth percentile of posttest probability revealed that CADENZA was significantly more sensitive and less specific than methods A and B. Therefore, at lower probability thresholds, CADENZA was a better screening method. However, methods A or B still had merit as a means to confirm higher probabilities generated by CADENZA (especially greater than or equal to 60%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nonrevascularized vessels were defined as obstructed vessels without grafts, obstructed grafts or native vessels obstructed distal to bypass graft insertion. Adequate quality echocardiograms were recorded at rest, peak exercise and after exercise in 38 patients (90%). Rest and postexercise echocardiograms were adequate in 3 others. Only 1 patient was excluded from analysis for inadequate peak and postexercise echocardiograms. Exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities were present in 33 of 35 patients (94%) who had 1 or more nonrevascularized vessels and these abnormalities were absent in 5 of 6 (83%) who had all vessels revascularized. Wall motion abnormalities were localized to the territory of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery or to a combined right (R) coronary-left circumflex (LC) region of circulation. Exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities were present in 24 of 27 LAD artery regions (89%) and 23 of 26 R-LC regions (88%) that had nonrevascularized vessels. These abnormalities were absent in 13 of 14 LAD regions (93%) and in 12 of 15 R-LC regions (80%) that had only revascularized vessels. Upright bicycle exercise echocardiography was successfully performed after CABG. The technique detected and accurately localized nonrevascularized and revascularized vessels.\r"

Blood glucose, insulin, and fructose were determined before and 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Glucose responses were significantly lower 60 and 120 min and the insulin response lower 60 min after the meals containing fructose. Hyperinsulinemic men showed a tendency toward decreased insulin sensitivity after consuming fructose on the basis of an increased insulin-to-glucose ratio and decreased insulin binding to erythrocytes. These results generally show a beneficial effect of fructose on glucose tolerance; however, recommendations for including large amounts of fructose in the diet should also be based on a complete evaluation of the effect on other metabolic risk factors.\r"

Therefore, lipid metabolism was evaluated in five NIDDM subjects (as inpatients) for 3 mo before and after ingestion of mixed meals containing 13% of calories as fructose. Triglyceride (TG) transport in very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) was assessed by multicompartmental analysis of VLDL-TG specific activity after injection of 3H-2-glycerol. There were no deleterious changes in lipid metabolism after fructose supplementation. The fructose diet produced no changes in serial free fatty acids (from 0.39 +/- 0.04 to 0.51 to 0.12 mmol/L), total cholesterol (from 5.43 +/- 0.52 to 5.53 +/- 0.57 mmol/L), high-density lipoproteins (from 0.91 +/- 0.08 to 0.93 +/- 0.08 mmol/L), low-density lipoproteins (from 3.10 +/- 0.52 to 2.92 +/- 0.47 mmol/L), VLDL-TG production (from 2.11 +/- 0.36 to 2.07 +/- 0.30 mmol/h), and fractional catabolic rate (from 0.186 +/- 0.014 to 0.196 +/- 0.03/h). Physiologic amounts of fructose are unlikely to have adverse effects on lipid metabolism when consumed by these diabetic subjects in place of sucrose in mixed meals for a prolonged period.\r"

The search for defective mechanisms that produce obesity has utilized animals with genetic, hypothalamic, and dietary types of obesity. In all three cases, obesity is associated with an absolute or relative decrease in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Experimental situations associated with reduced activity of the sympathetic nervous system are generally accompanied by increased food intake and vice versa. Hypothalamic obesity results from damage to the ventromedial hypothalamus, which disrupts modulation of the autonomic nervous system by nutrient and hormonal signals. Recessively inherited obesity may result from failure to modulate the steroid-receptor complex interaction with the promoter region of the genome. Impaired acetylation of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) may be involved in the development of obesity in the obese yellow mouse. In all cases adrenalectomy arrests the progression or reverses the obesity. These findings further strengthen the autonomic and endocrine hypothesis for obesity.\r"

There was no change in the TEM in lean subjects between weight maintenance and overfeeding. In the obese group the TEM was lower during both overfeeding (p less than 0.05) and underfeeding (p less than 0.05) compared with weight maintenance. Overfeeding increased rates of net postprandial glucose oxidation and decreased lipid oxidation in the lean subjects only. Alterations in glucose oxidation rates and the insulin response to meals may contribute to an impaired TEM in human obesity during overnutrition.\r"

This literature review documents that surrogate respondents can provide dietary information, but the data on elderly persons are extremely limited. The literature also indicates that surrogate dietary data may introduce misclassification in analytical investigations, but that surrogate data may be useful in descriptive studies.

Noninvasive methods, such as anthropometry and bioelectric impedance, could be used to predict body composition in elderly subjects if appropriate equations were available and validated against direct methods.

Frozen sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies M20 (keratin 8), M9 (keratin 18), and LP2K (keratin 19) with the use of the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. The immunohistochemical findings showed that the expression of keratins 8 and 18 was equally extensive in all normal, benign, and malignant lesions tested. In contrast, different staining patterns were observed with the use of monoclonal antibody to keratin 19. Follicular carcinomas were only focally stained with this antibody or were not reactive at all. Keratin 19, however, was present in all the tumor cells of papillary tissues and in a moderate amount of cells of nonneoplastic thyroid lesions and follicular adenomas. In papillary carcinoma, an identical homogeneous expression of keratin 19 was observed in both papillary and follicular structures, which suggests a common cellular origin. These results show that immunohistochemical staining with the use of monoclonal antibody against keratin 19 is useful to distinguish papillary thyroid carcinomas from follicular adenomas and follicular thyroid carcinomas.\r"

Five children with incomplete relief needed more than the single dose before resolution of signs and symptoms occurred. Coronary aneurysms in 2 patients before treatment regressed by 2 weeks. No patient developed coronary aneurysms. No child had sequelae of Kawasaki disease at a follow-up of 2 to 31 months.

  ".W": "The effects of atropine, proglumide, and somatostatin analogue (SMS 201-995) on bombesin-induced gallbladder contraction and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion were investigated in healthy volunteers. The gallbladder size was measured by real-time ultrasonography and the plasma CCK levels by radioimmunoassay. Bombesin (5 micrograms/30 min infusion) induced gallbladder contractions that reduced the gallbladder area to 36.6 +/- 2.1% of the original area 45 min after bombesin infusion, and caused a significant increase of plasma CCK from a basal level of 10.3 +/- 1.8 pg/ml to a peak level of 42.9 +/- 8.9 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) at 20 min. Atropine (500 micrograms, im) inhibited significantly (p less than 0.01) the gallbladder contraction (maximum contractile rate, 78.7 +/- 6.4%) in response to bombesin without any change of plasma CCK secretion, whereas proglumide (800 mg/day for 3 days, per os) decreased slightly but not significantly the gallbladder contraction, and had no effect on plasma CCK secretion. On the other hand, SMS 201-995 (50 micrograms, sc) almost completely inhibited both bombesin-induced CCK secretion and gallbladder contraction (maximum contractile rate, 93.6 +/- 6.2%). These findings suggest that atropine inhibits bombesin-induced gallbladder contraction, not via suppression of CCK release, but probably by inhibiting cholinergic mechanisms, whereas somatostatin inhibits gallbladder contraction, at least in part, by the suppression of bombesin-stimulated CCK secretion.\r"

Entered in the study were 750 males and 752 females (attendance rate, 95.7%). Gallstones were detected in two females aged 13 and 18 yr, respectively. None of the subjects in the study population had undergone cholecystectomy. The overall prevalence of gallstone disease was equal to 0.13% (0.27% in the female sex). A positive family history for biliary calculous disease was present in one of the two lithiasic girls. A progressive increase of GB volume with age was observed in both sexes, and figures were greater in males, than in age-matched females. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found between GB volume and body mass index (BMI) in both sexes. Obesity was recognized in 188 males (25.3%) and 167 females (25.0%). Obese subjects exhibited larger GB volumes than the nonobese age- and sex-matched controls. The study supports the view of a very low prevalence of gallstone disease in people younger than 20. It also provides information on GB size in relation to age, sex, and BMI.\r"

To assess the current situation, we have carried out ultrasonography studies on 100 urban black women, 55-85 yr old, with no clinical evidence of gastrointestinal disease, especially with reference to the biliary system. Ten patients (10%) were positive. There was no association with parity. Their body mass index (27.8 +/- 6.9) was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than those who were negative (25.7 +/- 6.1). From dietary intake assessments, there were no significant differences between those positive and negative with respect to mean intakes of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, dietary fiber or sugar (p greater than 0.05). Continuing exposure to a western lifestyle would be expected to increase prevalences of gallstones.\r"

  ".W": "Surgically resected polypoid lesions of the gallbladder from 97 patients were evaluated to determine both the shape (pedunculated or sessile) and diameter of the polypoid lesions, in association with malignancy. At the time of analysis, the largest polypoid lesion examined was when two or more lesions were detected in one patient because they were histologically the same. Carcinoma was noted in 9 (13%) of the 67 pedunculated lesions and in 10 (33%) of the 30 sessile lesions. The sessile carcinoma was 14 +/- 4 mm (8-20 mm) in maximum diameter, which was not significantly larger than the 8 +/- 4 mm of the benign polyps, but significantly smaller than the 22 +/- 8 mm (14-35 mm) of pedunculated carcinomas (p less than 0.05). Cancer invasion extended beyond the muscular layer in eight cases (80%) of sessile carcinoma, and two of them were 10 mm or less in diameter. On the other hand, cancer invasion was beyond the muscular layer in two cases (22%) of pedunculated carcinoma (p less than 0.05), and these two were 30 mm or more in diameter. Likewise, sessile carcinoma was characterized by both a higher incidence of nodal involvement and poorer prognosis, compared with pedunculated carcinoma. These findings indicate that surgery should be undertaken when sessile polyps are detected by ultrasonography, even though the polyp may be less than 10 mm in diameter. On the other hand, with regard to the pedunculated type, malignancy should be suspected when the polyp is more than 10 mm in diameter.\r"

Comparison of results by various diagnostic imaging techniques with histopathological findings revealed that tumor necrosis after US-PEIT was correlated with increased echogenicity of the tumor by US, decreased density of the tumor and disappearance of contrast enhancement by computed tomography (CT), and change to a lower signal in the tumor by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI, 0.15 T permanent magnet, spin-echo sequence, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) = 2000/80 ms]. Thus, findings by imaging are useful in evaluating the initial effect of US-PEIT. Of three specimens obtained by liver resection and three obtained at autopsy, four showed complete necrosis after US-PEIT (maximum tumor diameter, 3 cm). This method also appeared to be effective in cases of capsular invasion. In this study, the 2-yr survival rate of patients with HCC was 75%. Although this study was not a controlled clinical trial, we conclude that US-PEIT may be a potentially effective treatment for HCC.\r"

Immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B surface and core antigens were strongly positive in almost all hepatocytes, but not in tumor tissue. Whereas the occurrence of lymphoma probably is related to HIV infection, possible interactions between hepatitis B virus and HIV infection are discussed. Thus, the presence of mass lesions within the liver in a patient with HIV infection should raise the possibility of hepatic lymphoma even if there is no evidence of generalized lymphadenopathy.\r"

Fifteen cases were studied and the localization of antigen in the dense deposits in glomeruli compared with the immunofluorescence (IF) findings on the same cases. The results obtained by IF and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) were comparable for IgG and IgA. In most instances, IgM and C3 were more intensely labeled by IF than IEM. Some discrepancies were noted for fibrinogen. It is postulated that these differences are related to a partial loss of antigenicity due to fixation or chemical reaction with the embedding medium. The advantage of IEM resides in localizing antigens in very small deposits seen in early stages of glomerulonephritis. The method can supplement IF in diagnostically difficult cases or be substituted for it when material for IF is not available.\r"

  ".W": "Antigen-induced activation of resting T cells induces the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as well as the expression of specific cell surface high-affinity receptors for this lymphokine. There are at least two forms of the cellular receptors for IL-2, one with a very high affinity and the other with a lower affinity. Two IL-2 binding peptides, a 55-kd peptide reactive with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody and a 75-kd, non-Tac IL-2-binding peptide, were identified. A multichain model for the high-affinity receptor in which an independently existing p55 or p75 peptide would represent low-or intermediate-affinity receptors, respectively, and high-affinity receptors would be expressed when both of these receptors are expressed and associated in a receptor complex, is proposed. An additional 95 - to 105-kd peptide may also participate in the multisubunit, high-affinity form of the IL-2 receptor. The p75 peptide is receptor for IL-2 on large granular lymphocytes and is sufficient for the IL-2 activation of these cells. In contrast to resting T cells, the T cells of patients with certain neoplasias of mononuclear cells and of patients with select autoimmune disorders, as well as T cells participating in organ allograft rejections, express the Tac antigen. To exploit the fact that IL-2 receptors are present on abnormally activated T cells but no on normal resting T cells, clinical trials have been initiated involving patients with neoplastic or autoimmune disorders as well as those receiving organ allografts. These patients are being treated with unmodified anti-Tac, with isotopic (212 Bi and 90Y) chelates of anti-Tac, with truncated Pseudomonas toxin conjugates of anti-Tac or IL-2, and with recombinant chimeric \"humanized\" anti-Tac.\r"

Such an approach is more selective than targeting all T cells, or even the CD4 or CD8 major subsets, because only the very recently activated cells should be affected. A clinical trial of anti-Tac monoclonal antibody is in progress in which 20 mg of the immunoglobulin G 2a (lgG2a) antibody is administered intravenously daily for 10 days after cadaveric renal transplantation. Combinations with and without azathioprine, and with varying doses of cyclosporine with prednisone, are being evaluated in a randomized trial. Results to date show a significant immunosuppressive effect of anti-Tac, as measured by a reduced incidence and later onset of acute rejection episodes compared with cyclosporine plus prednisone or cyclosporine plus azathioprine plus prednisone. Removal or cytodestruction of IL-2-receptor positive cells from the peripheral blood does not occur to any major degree, even though serum levels of the antibody are always detectable. In addition, functional studies of MLR, CML, and suppressor cell generation 4 days after cessation of anti-Tac administration show no significant difference between treated and control groups The effect of anti-Tac seems, therefore, to be limited to inhibition of IL-2-mediated T-cell growth during the period of administration, with recovery after a few days' lag period.\r"

  ".W": "The assumption that CD8+-cytotoxic cells effect graft rejection has diverted many in clinical and experimental transplantation into ignoring the tremendous potential of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies as immunosuppressive therapy. Experimental studies over the past several years has shown that anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies have effects on prolonging graft survival equal to or greater than those of cyclosporine. This therapy has the unique capacity to induce tolerance to the monoclonal antibody itself, thus preventing the production both of antiidiotypic and antimouse immunoglobulin antibodies. Further, many animals develop tolerance to other antigens, including grafted tissue, raising the potential of eliminating the need for long-term immunosuppression. Synergy between anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies and other immunosuppressives, including anti-CD8 antibodies and cyclosporine, has also been demonstrated. Continued investigation to determine the best monoclonal antibody to use in humans with respect to its epitope, immunoglobulin subclass, and capacity to deplete CD4+ cells is required to maximize the potential of this therapy before clinical trial.\r"

In these cases, the deletion marker is specifically associated with one class of common HRAS1 allele, thereby establishing the origin of the unique allele. We discuss the means by which DNA sequence heterogeneity at other loci may be rapidly analyzed.\r"

  ".U": "90053588\r", 
  ".W": "The chromosomal translocation that fuses the phl gene with the c-abl proto-oncogene appears to be a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of some leukemias. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) the breakage within the phl gene is largely confined to a 5.8-kb segment referred to as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr). To determine whether the presence of specific bcr exons on the Philadelphia chromosome has any clinical significance, we have analyzed the bcr breakpoints in 134 patients with CML. As many as five probes were used in this analysis, including a synthetic oligonucleotide probe homologous to the bcr exon 3 (phl exon 14) region. The distribution of breakpoints indicates that, in fact, breakage is largely confined to a 3.1-kb segment lying between bcr exon 2 and exon 4 (phl exons 13-15). In 61 CML patients analyzed within 1 year of diagnosis, the distribution of breakpoints appeared to be random within the 3.1-kb region. However, a significant excess of 5' breakpoints was observed in the total population studied, consistent with previous data showing that patients with 3' breakpoints have shorter disease durations. Analysis using the bcr exon 3 sequence probe indicated it was probably the presence or absence of bcr exon 3 on the Philadelphia chromosome that accounts for some of the variability in disease duration seen in CML. The data suggest that the phl/abl protein product may influence the timing of the onset of blast crisis and imply a continuing role for this protein during the evolution of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND METHODS: Seizures and unexpectedly low phenytoin levels prompted a retrospective review of phenytoin doses and serum levels in patients with primary brain tumors following the administration of cisplatin and carmustine (BCNU) chemotherapy. RESULTS: All patients who received three or more cycles of this chemotherapeutic regimen required an increase in their maintenance phenytoin dose to maintain therapeutic phenytoin levels. The average increase in the daily phenytoin dose was 41% (range, 20% to 100%). In addition, 17 of 26 (65%) assessable chemotherapy cycles were accompanied by a greater than 20% decrease in phenytoin levels or an increase in phenytoin requirements. Significant changes in phenytoin levels occurred as early as two days after administration of chemotherapy and were seen exclusively in treatment cycles that contained cisplatin. Five additional cases were found in the literature in which serum phenytoin concentrations decreased after the administration of antineoplastic agents. CONCLUSIONS: These observations are important to physicians treating patients who are receiving phenytoin. Serious consequences can be avoided by expecting changes in phenytoin dosage requirements after the administration of chemotherapy, monitoring serum levels frequently, and making appropriate adjustments in phenytoin dosages. Prospective evaluations are needed to confirm these observations, to define the chemotherapeutic agents that predispose patients to these alterations in phenytoin's pharmacology, and to determine if drugs other than phenytoin are affected by the administration of chemotherapy.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved a retrospective review of patients with systemic sclerosis at a tertiary care facility presenting with clinical and/or radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease in the absence of cutaneous manifestations of scleroderma, and a MEDLINE, computer search for patients who presented with lung disease and later developed taut skin (scleroderma). RESULTS: Ten patients with systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma presenting with pulmonary signs or symptoms were discovered. A positive antinuclear antibody (seven of eight), esophageal dysmotility (eight of nine), restrictive lung disease (six of eight), Raynaud's phenomenon (five of eight), and abnormal nailfold capillaries (six of six) were present in these patients. Six of these 10 patients developed typical scleroderma from four months to seven years after presentation. Lung pathology was examined in six patients and all had changes consistent with interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis. Four of the 10 patients had occupations that could have exposed them to potential pulmonary toxins. In contrast to patients with typical scleroderma, all 10 patients we discovered were men. conclusions: Systemic sclerosis should be considered in patients with idiopathic interstitial lung disease even in the absence of classic sclerodermatous cutaneous involvement. An esophagram, antinuclear antibody, and widefield nailfold examination may facilitate the diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The utility of Traube's space percussion in the bedside assessment of splenic enlargement was evaluated. The influence of meals and obesity on this sign were also assessed, because both are believed to interfere with the results of abdominal percussion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The inpatient population of a tertiary care hospital was studied where cases and controls were selected according to the results of abdominal ultrasonographic examinations. RESULTS: Traube's space percussion exhibited a sensitivity of 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.71) and a specificity of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.80) when classifying tympanitic examinations as negative. False-positive examinations were reduced by assessing patients more than two hours after mealtime. Obese patients were a source of false-negative examinations. CONCLUSION: Traube's space percussion compares favorably with other commonly used clinical maneuvers and diagnostic tests. When performed alone in a selected patient population, it adds useful clinical information but is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to obviate the need for further diagnostic testing.\r"

  ".W": "Buttercup extract (BE), an extract of the buttercup plant (Zanthoriza simplicissima), inhibits RNA and DNA synthesis by HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Exposure of these cells to 3% BE for 48 hours results in dramatic inhibition of RNA synthesis without loss of cell viability. The effect of BE is partially reversible over 12-24 hours with the level of RNA synthesis returning nearly to control levels during this time period. DNA synthesis is also reversibly inhibited by exposure to BE. Despite the inhibition of RNA synthesis in HL-60 cells, there is no decrease in the level of c-myc mRNA, even at high BE concentrations. The level of gene-specific mRNA for the c-Ha-ras, c-fms, and c-mos genes in these cells also remained constant during exposure to BE. Ribosomal RNA is not degraded during 24 hours of BE treatment in vitro, suggesting that BE does not maintain the relative mRNA level for these genes by selective degradation of other RNA species. The inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis by BE without a corresponding alteration in the level of expression of the c-myc gene suggests that this agent dissociates c-myc expression and cellular proliferation in these cells.\r"

Based on previous studies, the authors recommended that these patients receive greater than or equal to 90 meq of sodium/day on each day of amphotericin B administration. Patients who received this amount of sodium on every day of amphotericin B therapy were classified as adequate sodium. The adequate sodium group was further subdivided on the basis of whether or not the adequate sodium was in the form of sodium ticarcillin. Patients not receiving this amount of sodium on every day of amphotericin B therapy were classified as inadequate sodium; overall, these patients received greater than or equal to 90 meq of sodium/day on 74% of days on which they received amphotericin B. The inadequate sodium and adequate sodium groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, gender, diagnoses, or baseline creatinine. The incidence of nephrotoxicity (creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl) was significantly higher, 4 of 14 (29%), in the inadequate sodium group, as compared to the adequate sodium, adequate ticarcillin group, 1 of 35 (3%), or the adequate sodium only group, 1 of 24 (4%), p = .008. To adjust for total amphotericin dose, the risk of nephrotoxicity as a function of time on study was evaluated by the life table method; the risk of nephrotoxicity was significantly greater in the inadequate sodium group, p = .019.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Kaposi's sarcoma is a neoplasm that develops as multifocal lesions, often involving the skin, characterized by a complex histologic picture including numerous vascular spaces, perivascular and interstitial spindle-shaped cells, and extravasated erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Using an antibody against factor XIIIa, which identifies dermal dendrocytes, numerous factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes were detected among the spindle-shaped cells in 12 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated, and five non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocytes were also increased in histologic simulators of Kaposi's sarcoma such as dermatofibroma, angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma, granuloma annulare, and early wound healing, but were absent in keloids. The increased number of dermal dendrocytes, which are often in an angiocentric configuration and which also express CD4, lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), and Leu M3 in Kaposi's sarcoma, may be important to the angioproliferative response. The results suggested that the spindle-shaped cells that are present in a variety of cutaneous lesions are dermal dendrocytes and belong to the reticuloendothelial system, unlike other mesenchymal cell types such as the endothelial cell. Apparently a diverse array of stimuli, including human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection and trauma, can stimulate the accumulation of factor XIIIa expressing dermal dendrocytes in the skin. These cells can then participate in different stages of a variety of cutaneous alterations including Kaposi's sarcoma, dermatofibroma, granuloma annulare, and early wound healing. Thus, the factor XIIIa-positive dermal dendrocyte is a common cellular denominator among diverse clinical entities that share some histologic features.\r"

  ".W": "Low density lipoproteins (LDL) that have been oxidatively modified have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against oxidatively modified human low density lipoproteins (OxLDL); these antibodies reacted with OxLDL, but did not react with native LDL, either in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a Western blot analysis. The anti-OxLDL antibodies did react with other modified forms of LDL (eg, acetylated LDL, malondialdehyde-modified LDL, and cell-modified LDL) that were recognized by the scavenger receptor on macrophages. Single- and double-label immunofluorescence of atheromatous lesions from a Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit demonstrated some colocalization of proteins detected by anti-LDL and anti-OxLDL antibodies. However, clearly there were also areas stained by the anti-OxLDL antibodies that did not stain with anti-LDL. Staining of the lesion by the anti-OxLDL antibody was abolished by adsorption of the antibody with OxLDL, but not by adsorption with LDL or bovine serum albumin. Arterial tissue from a control New Zealand White rabbit did not show staining with anti-LDL or anti-OxLDL antibodies. These observations suggest that OxLDL (or possibly other proteins recognized by the anti-OxLDL antibody) is present in atheromatous lesions of WHHL rabbits, and are consistent with oxidatively modified lipoproteins having a role in atherogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90053807\r", 
  ".W": "The estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) content of cultured human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) was determined by biochemical assay, immunoblot analysis, and immunohistochemical assay under varying conditions of hormonal stimulation. The ER and PR content in cytosolic and nuclear extracts varied with steroid treatment. However, both the amount and distribution of each receptor in these extracts was virtually the same when determined by steroid binding and immunoblot analyses. Two immunocytochemical parameters (staining intensity and proportion of cells stained) correlated with the quantitative analyses of ER and PR, but not with the subcellular distribution. When MCF-7 cells were grown for 4 days in charcoal-stripped serum without phenol red, 93% of total ER was found in the cytosol (10 mM KCl), whereas short-term treatment with 5 nM estradiol resulted in the appearance of 82% of total ER in the nuclear extract (400 mM KCl). With either cell treatment only nuclear staining for ER was observed. Progesterone receptor was virtually undetectable in the same cells by any method. After 4 days of treatment by 5 nM estradiol, PR was strongly induced (50-fold) in MCF-7 cells as determined by all three methods. As observed for ER, 95% of total induced PR was found in the cytosol in the absence of a progestin. Short-term treatment with 5 nM ORG 2058, a synthetic progestin, resulted in the appearance of 42% of total PR in the nuclear extract. However, only strong nuclear staining for PR was observed in either the presence or absence of a progestin. These findings are consistent with the current view of ER and PR as nuclear receptors present in at least two forms. One of these, the unoccupied form of the receptor, is easily removed from the nucleus by hypotonic buffers during the cell homogenization process and appears in the cytosolic extract. The other form of the receptor, the steroid-occupied form, is more tightly bound to nuclear components and is removed from nuclei only under more vigorous extraction conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Keratin-type intermediate filament proteins show characteristic expression in normal and pathologic epidermis. Some keratins are restricted to the basal cell layers, and others occur exclusively in the suprabasal compartment. SDS-gel-electrophoresis and immunohistochemistry are generally used for the assessment of keratin profiles and their localizations. In the present investigation, flow cytometric analysis of four different monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against intermediate filament-type proteins, in addition to measurement of relative DNA content, was performed on cell suspensions derived from lesional and clinically uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients and from skin of healthy controls. MAb Ks8.12, reacting with keratins 13 and 16, was used as a marker for hyperproliferation. Pab601 recognizes the basal cell layer(s) of human epidermis. Keratin 10 expression as a marker of keratinization was quantified with RKSE60 and the anti-vimentin MAb MVI was used as a marker for non-keratinocytes. Psoriatic skin showed significantly reduced numbers of RKSE60-positive cells and MVI-positive cells compared with normal skin. In contrast to normal skin and uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients in which only a minority of the cells were Ks8.12 positive, up to 60% of the cell population in psoriatic lesions bound with MAb. Simultaneous measurement of relative DNA content and MAb binding showed that Pab601 binding was associated with cells in S-phase and G2M-phase of the cell cycle, whereas RKSE60 and Ks8.12 binding were associated with diploid cells. Multiparameter flow cytometry allows quantitative population analysis that could lead to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of epidermal growth control under normal and pathologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against two non-cross-reacting antigens of human IL-1 beta (Vhp20 and BRhC3) and human TNF alpha (B154.2 and B154.7) were applied to identify cytokine-containing cells in tissue sections and in cell suspensions. IL-1 beta- or TNF alpha-positive cells were not present in immunostained cytocentrifuge smears prepared from freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocytes, spleen, and lymph node cells. After 18 hours of culture with bacterial endotoxin (LPS), 80% to 90% of blood monocytes, 30% of spleen macrophages, and 2% to 28% of lymph node macrophages were strongly positive for IL-1 beta with either of the MAbs. Furthermore, 25% to 35% of blood monocytes and 6% to 60% of lymph node macrophages were stained for TNF alpha. Cells positive for IL-1 beta or TNF alpha were extremely rare in sections of normal thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Immunoreactivity for IL-1 beta or TNF alpha was frequently observed in sections of granulomatous lymphadenitis (N = 11). IL-1 beta or TNF alpha staining was confined to the epithelioid macrophages forming the granuloma, and the intensity of TNF alpha reactivity was generally stronger. The high frequency of cytokine-containing cells in this pathologic condition was confirmed in a cell suspension study showing that 20% of epithelioid macrophages were weakly positive for IL-1 beta and 80% were strongly positive for TNF alpha. The presence of cytokine-containing cells was investigated in cryostat sections of several nonlymphoid organs with normal histologic appearance. IL-1 beta reactivity was not observed in any of the tissues. TNF alpha reactivity was frequently demonstrated in isolated macrophages embedded in the interstitial connective tissue.\r"

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using alcohol-fixed neutrophils demonstrates two ANCA types: one causing cytoplasmic staining (C-ANCA), and a second causing artifactual perinuclear staining (P-ANCA) that frequently has specificity for myeloperoxidase. Using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (IIFM) and enzyme immunoassays (EIA), sera from over 300 patients with renal disease, with and without systemic vasculitis, were analyzed. Of 76 patients with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis with crescents or necrosis, 87% had ANCA by IIFM (38% of C-ANCA type, 49% of P-ANCA type), and 78% had ANCA by EIA. Of 55 patients with nonlupus immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, only 11% had ANCA by IIFM and 5% had ANCA by EIA. Of 24 patients with anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis, none had ANCA. Renal and extrarenal lesions were studied in 81 patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. These patients formed a pathologic continuum ranging from renal-limited to widespread systemic vascular injury, including patients with primary crescentic glomerulonephritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and polyarteritis nodosa. In ANCA-positive patients the frequency of C-ANCA and P-ANCA correlated with disease distribution. P-ANCA was most frequent with renal-limited disease and C-ANCA was most frequent when there was lung and sinus involvement. It is proposed that ANCA are not only useful diagnostic markers, but may also be directly involved in a novel pathogenetic mechanism that is a frequent cause of crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic necrotizing vasculitis.\r"
