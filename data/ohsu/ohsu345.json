  ".W": "The ability of purified anaphylatoxins to induce human lung mast cell mediator release was investigated. In eight anti-IgE responsive (histamine release = 22 +/- 5%, mean +/- SEM) mast cell preparations of 1-96% purity, C5a and C5a des Arg (0.55 pg/ml to 55 micrograms/ml), failed to elicit or potentiate histamine release; lung fragments were similarly unresponsive. The related peptide C3a was also inactive. All anaphylatoxins failed to induce mast cell leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) release. LTC4 release was also negligible from basophils where C5a was a potent histamine release stimulus. Supernatants from C5a-challenged mast cells remained fully active on basophils, excluding carboxypeptidase inactivation of C5a as an explanation for the lung mast cell results. In contrast to lung, skin mast cells were C5a-responsive (histamine release = 8 +/- 1%, at 55 micrograms/ml, n = 2). We conclude that C5a, though devoid of activity on the human lung mast cell, is a human basophil and skin mast cell secretagogue. These findings demonstrate significant organ-specific heterogeneity in mast cell responsiveness.\r"

  ".U": "88139799\r", 
  ".W": "A tumor-derived factor believed to cause hypercalcemia by acting on the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor was recently purified, cloned, and found to have NH2-terminal sequence homology with PTH. The 1-34 region of this protein was synthesized, evaluated for its postreceptor effects on the ROS 17/2.8 cell line, and its properties were compared to 1-34 PTH. Both 1-34 human humoral hypercalcemia factor (HCF) and 1-34 PTH stimulated adenylate cyclase with an effective concentration (EC)50 of approximately 1 nM. The extent of stimulation by both peptides was equally enhanced by dexamethasone. They both had a pronounced inhibitory effect on growth in the presence of dexamethasone, with an EC50 of approximately 0.1 nM, reduced alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity by approximately 70% in the absence of dexamethasone and by approximately 80% in the presence of dexamethasone with an EC50 of 0.03 nM, and when present at a concentration of 10 nM, reduced AP mRNA levels (estimated by Northern analysis) by approximately 80% in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. Thus, in addition to similar dose-response curves for adenylate cyclase stimulation, both HCF and PTH produced identical postreceptor effects in ROS 17/2.8 cells. These effects of HCF are probably mediated by the interaction of the tumor-derived factor with the PTH receptor.\r"

Differences in income strata and urban/rural settings were not significant. Peer influence was the major factor that initiated smokeless tobacco use. Abnormal mucosal findings were much more prevalent in those who had dipped smokeless tobacco than in those who had not. Most significant was a prevalence of oral leukoplakia in 5.2% of those who had ever dipped, which was 50 times that of nondippers. Using smokeless tobacco for more than 2 years or using more than three tins per week seemed to be of possible predictive value regarding the incidence of oral leukoplakia. Fifteen percent of current users had observable leukoplakia. Components necessary for effective intervention/prevention programs were elucidated with an emphasis on an increased role by dentists and other health professionals.\r"

Immediately after treatment, patients were asked to respond to a list of 25 dentist behaviors thought to be associated with positive dentist-patient interaction. Criterion measures obtained by patients were self-ratings of anxiety during treatment and satisfaction measures from the DVSS. Ten behaviors were significantly associated with anxiety reduction. A stepwise multiple regression analysis with anxiety reduction as the dependent variable indicated that to the patient, the dentist's explicit dedication to prevent pain was the most important dentist behavior, with friendliness, working quickly, being calm, and giving moral support, being important auxiliary behaviors. Most of the 25 dentist behaviors studied were associated with patient satisfaction. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the dentist's empathy and communicativeness were among important correlates of patient satisfaction. An experimental approach to causal analysis of anxiety reducing behaviors needs to be studied.\r"

Evidence of intraoral candidiasis, especially loss of filiform lingual papillae, was present in several cases. The disorder mimics the early stage of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis but remains within a few millimeters of the mucocutaneous junction and affected individuals appear (with a possible exception) to be immune competent. Mild trauma apparently triggers the infection.

Two different forms of the molecule were detected, indicating it is polymorphic. The genes encoding gp98 were shown not to be linked to the guinea pig lymphocyte Ag complex. The molecule gp98 was found on macrophages within populations of peritoneal exudate cells, resident peritoneal cells, bone marrow cells, and spleen. All gp98-bearing macrophages were also Ia-positive. However, only a subpopulation of macrophages bore gp98. The gp98 was not found on Ly-1 or Ig-bearing cells, indicating that B and T cells do not bear Ia. Thus, gp98 appears to be a highly immunogenic polymorphic macrophage-specific molecule that allows the characterization of guinea pig macrophage subsets.\r"

Surgical procedures were comparable for all the antibiotic groups, although proportionately more simple hysterectomies were performed in Dallas. The patients received a povidone-iodine vaginal preparation immediately before surgery; vaginal packs, when used, contained no antimicrobial agents. Primary prophylactic failure (operative site infection) occurred in 1 of 52 (1.9%) and 4 of 47 (8.5%) of the ceftizoxime- and cefoxitin-treated patients, respectively, for a nonsignificant difference. All five primary prophylactic failures occurred in the Los Angeles patients. One patient in each antibiotic group developed a urinary tract infection and was classified as a secondary prophylactic failure. Febrile morbidity, length of hospital stay and incidence of adverse effects did not differ by antibiotic. The enterococcus was commonly found in the postoperative vaginal flora and was of no value in predicting operative-site infection. Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated more commonly in patients who received cefoxitin.

Daily interferon (IFN) treatment resulted in a very marked increase in survival time and apparent cure of 4 of 22 tumor-inoculated mice. In contrast, treatment of tumor-injected (iv) mice with cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and methotrexate increased survival time by only a few days; and treatment of mice with cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, bleomycin, or etoposide was ineffective. However, when FLCs were injected ip, both cytostatic drugs and IFN exerted an antitumor effect. We conclude that IFN alpha/beta was particularly effective in inhibiting the development of liver and spleen metastases and in increasing mouse survival time after iv inoculation of FLCs.\r"

Urinary prostaglandin E2 levels were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the hypercalciuric group than in the normocalciuric and healthy control groups, and they showed a positive correlation with urinary calcium excretion. Urinary prostaglandin E2 and calcium excretions in the hypercalciuric and normocalciuric groups were suppressed significantly by indomethacin. Creatinine clearance was not reduced by indomethacin. The results suggest that renal prostaglandin E2 may participate in calcium stone formation by regulating the renal tubular handling of calcium.\r"

Chemotherapy was given over two or three years and was more intense in group II. Both groups showed a similar significant decrease in height standard deviation score (SDS) over four years (group I -0.31, group II -0.39). 15 children in group I were followed to ten years and continued to show restricted growth with a mean height SDS decrease of -0.84 (range 0 to -1.7). The greatest reduction in yearly decrements in height SDS occurred in the first year after diagnosis. In both groups height SDS increased significantly on completion of chemotherapy. Thus chemotherapy protocols contribute to growth retardation in ALL. In most of these children the mean loss of height over ten years was not sufficiently great to justify long-term growth hormone (GH) therapy.\r"

Within a single health district all patients with histologically confirmed cancer and negative 99mTc bone scans were managed, irrespective of clinical stage or pathological grade, according to a conservative regimen that included no form of anti-cancer treatment other than endoscopic resection for relief of urinary symptoms. Complete records were compiled on 120 of 152 patients (mean age 74.8 years, range 62-90) without metastases at diagnosis. Local tumour increased to palpable dimensions (T2/T3) in 100 of these patients (84%) but metastases developed in only 13, the mean time to scan conversion being 35.8 months. 23 patients were withdrawn from study and treated because of concern about increasing tumour size, and metastases developed in 1 of these. 5 patients died of prostatic cancer but the disease was not responsible for 48 additional deaths. Actuarial survival rates (excluding non-cancer deaths) at 5 and 7 years were 80% and 75%, respectively; the corresponding rate for those with metastases at presentation was 13% at 5 years. The likelihood that prostatic cancer will cause death within 7 years is indicated primarily by the scintigraphic findings at diagnosis.\r"

The two mutant alleles are common among caucasians of northern European ancestry; detection in genomic DNA samples of patients and carriers by hybridisation with oligonucleotides specific for the respective mutant alleles requires fractionation of restriction-enzyme-digested genomic DNA samples by gel electrophoresis. This method is too cumbersome for mass screening of PKU carriers. Identification of carriers of the mutant alleles was achieved by direct analysis of their genomic DNA samples after specific amplification of a sub-genomic DNA fragment containing both mutation sites by polymerase chain reaction. The results suggest that it is technically feasible to develop a programme for carrier detection of the genetic trait in the population for individuals without a family history of PKU.\r"

The annual incidence of all campylobacter infections was 2.1 episodes per child. The incidence was inversely related to age (r = -0.78 p less than 0.02). The illness-to-infection ratio, which in infants younger than 6 months was 1:2, was negatively associated with age (r = -0.7, p less than 0.02). Only symptom-producing infections occurring early in life seemed to protect against subsequent infections.\r"

None of the women had clinical evidence of measles. Adjusting for background variables, logistic regression analysis showed no tendency towards reduced risk of perinatal mortality among children of women exposed during pregnancy relative to controls. Both stillbirth and early neonatal mortality rates were increased. A similar tendency was found in a rural epidemic (OR = 9.5; 95% CI 2.6-35.1). Exposure during any trimester of fetal life increased the rate of perinatal mortality. The results suggest that exposure to measles virus or some concomitantly transmitted pathogen may contribute to the high perinatal mortality risk found in many developing countries. The possible long-term health consequences of exposure to measles virus should be considered when assessing the value of measles control programmes.\r"

To determine the impact of this revision, information was extracted from the medical charts of the 630 patients receiving comprehensive medical care as of 1980 at 6 haemophilia treatment centres, and who were therefore likely to have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 38 (6%) and 47 (7%) met the 1985 and 1987 case definitions, respectively (22% increase). Of the cases added by use of the 1987 case definition, 3 patients had HIV dementia, 3 had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (2 of whom were presumptively diagnosed and 1 who had been receiving steroids and immunosuppressives), and 3 had HIV wasting syndrome. These data suggest that the revision of the AIDS case definition will have a substantial impact on future AIDS surveillance trends in persons with haemophilia and perhaps in other risk groups.\r"

The trial collapsed when the manufacturers stopped making lofexidine on commercial grounds and the charitable foundation which was backing the trial withdrew its support. Some of the insecurities of medical research may have little to do with scientific merit.\r"

In the setting of agranulocytosis and fever, rapidly enlarging intraorbital masses require urgent ophthalmologic attention. Immediate biopsy is indicated to distinguish between several treatable conditions including opportunistic infection, hemorrhage, and neoplastic infiltration.\r"

Computerized tomography is a relatively new diagnostic technique and when used in conjunction with sialography can provide very useful preoperative information about parotid lesions. A case is presented in which computerized tomography sialography was performed preoperatively in a patient with a parotid gland swelling and greatly assisted in the diagnosis and operative treatment. The technique is described in detail and previous reports of the procedure are reviewed.\r"

Diseased, missing, and filled surfaces, mobile teeth, and periodontal disease were more prevalent in patients with systemic sclerosis than control subjects. Periodontal membrane width was increased in patients with systemic sclerosis and involved all groups of teeth. Mandibular erosions were seen in 9 of 31 patients and involved the mandibular angle, the condylar head, the coronoid process, and the digastric region. These lesions were associated with the presence of periodontal membrane thickening and were seen in patients with more severe systemic sclerosis.\r"

This is an unacceptable variation in results and probably relates more to the referral biases inherent in hospital-based studies than to any other factor. The present population-based study, which is relatively free of selection bias, demonstrates that 62%, 36%, and 18% of invasive carcinomas of the labial vermilion, oral cavity proper, and oropharynx, respectively, have leukoplakia lesions of immediately adjacent mucosal surfaces. Only 7% of invasive carcinomas have juxtaposed carcinoma in situ, whereas another 2% have severe epithelial dysplasia. Mucosal carcinomas associated with leukoplakias appear to be smaller, more mature histologically, and more likely to be only superficially invasive; such carcinomas present with fewer metastases at diagnosis and provide a better prognosis than similar carcinomas not associated with leukoplakia.\r"

  ".W": "In order to ascertain whether the time of administration of an antibiotic affects the occurrence of flare-ups and non-flare-up-associated swelling and pain, an analysis of components of two prospective endodontic studies on patients having asymptomatic teeth with pulpal necrosis and associated periapical radiolucent lesions (PN/PL) was done. In the first study, prophylactic penicillin was used. In the second study, penicillin (or erythromycin for patients allergic to penicillin) was taken by the patient at the first sign of swelling (patient controlled). For the patient-controlled group, as compared to the prophylactic penicillin group, there was statistically significantly more (1) incidence of flare-ups (p less than 0.05); (2) non-flare-up-associated swelling (p less than 0.001); (3) non-flare-up-associated pain (p less than 0.05); (4) combined moderate and severe pain (p less than 0.05); (5) combined incidence of flare-ups and swelling (p less than 0.001); (6) combined incidence of flare-ups and pain (p less than 0.01); and (7) combined incidence of flare-ups and both swelling and pain (p less than 0.001). There were statistically significantly fewer instances of (1) no patient post-treatment problems (p less than 0.001) and (2) combined mild pain and no patient post-treatment problems (p less than 0.001). Hence, for asymptomatic teeth with PN/PL, it appears that prophylactic antibiotics are preferable to antibiotics taken by the patient at the first sign of swelling.\r"

Their hypoxanthine level was 459 +/- 171 mumol/L (mean +/- SD) compared with 54 +/- 71 mumol/L in seven newborn babies who died suddenly (P less than .001). In 53 adults who died suddenly, the hypoxanthine concentration was 136 +/- 119 mumol/L (P less than .001 when compared with babies with respiratory distress syndrome). Babies with respiratory distress syndrome underwent a significantly longer period with arterial PO2 levels less than 40 mm Hg (5.3 kPa) and they required supplementation with 100% oxygen significantly longer than control babies. The hypoxanthine concentration was correlated with the time during which the arterial PO2 was lower than 40 mm Hg (5.3 kPa) before death, and a significant positive correlation was found (R = .59, P less than .12). The study shows that high levels of hypoxanthine are found in vitreous humor of premature babies with respiratory distress syndrome. Because hypoxanthine is a potential oxygen radical generator and premature babies might have lower levels of antioxidants than full-term babies, it is suggested that the hypoxanthine accumulation in the eyes of premature babies with respiratory distress syndrome could play a pathogenetic role in the development of retinopathy of prematurity.\r"

The metal complex binds cooperatively to A-form helices of various base sequences under conditions where little or no binding was found to analogous B-form DNAs. Photoactivated DNA cleavage may be coupled to this conformation-specific binding by taking advantage of the photophysical properties of ruthenium(II) complexes. lambda-Ru(TMP)2+3 cleaves preferentially 3H-labeled A-form polynucleotides upon irradiation with visible light. The photoinduced DNA strand scission is likely to be mediated by singlet oxygen, which leads to a preferential cleavage of guanine residues. Comparative mapping of cleavage sites on a linear pBR322 fragment for tris(phenanthroline)ruthenium(II), which binds to B-DNA and cleaves also by sensitization of singlet oxygen, and for Ru(TMP)2+3 shows the selective binding of lambda-Ru(TMP)2+3 to conformationally distinct sites along the fragment.

W., and Boynton, J. E. (1984) Plant Mol. Biol. 3, 177-190]. We have isolated a suppressed strain (FUD50su) that can grow under phototrophic conditions, although it still showed no synthesis of the beta subunit of coupling factor 1. Thylakoid membranes of the FUD50su strain were similar to those of the original FUD50 strain, in that they both lacked all the subunits making up the chloroplast ATP synthase complex. We show that photosynthesis in FUD50su is sensitive to inhibitors such as antimycin, specific for mitochondrial electron transport. This observation indicates that photosynthesis in the FUD50su strain is achieved through an unusual interaction between mitochondria and chloroplast. Exportation of light-induced reduced compounds from the chloroplast to the mitochondria elicits ATP formation in the latter, and ATP is subsequently imported to the chloroplast. The activation of such an ATP shuttle coupled to an NADPH shuttle would thus provide the reducing power and the free energy needed for carbon assimilation in a chloroplast that lacks chloroplast ATP synthase.\r"

The oligothymidylate was further substituted by an acridine derivative to stabilize the hybrid formed with a complementary octadeoxyadenylate sequence via intercalation. A single-stranded 27-mer containing a (dA)8 sequence and a 27-mer duplex containing a (dA.dT)8 sequence were used as targets. Upon UV irradiation, photocrosslinking of the octathymidylate to its target sequence was observed, generating bands that migrated more slowly in denaturing gels. In the 27-mer duplex, both strands were photocrosslinked to the octathymidylate. Upon alkaline treatment of the irradiated samples, cleavage of the 27-mers was observed at specific sites. These reactions were analyzed at different salt concentrations. The location of the cleavage sites allowed us to demonstrate the following. (i) Both alpha and beta oligothymidylates can recognize a DNA double helix containing an oligo(dA).oligo(dT) sequence; the oligothymidylate binds to the major groove of DNA in a parallel orientation with respect to the adenine-containing strand of the DNA double helix. (ii) alpha oligothymidylates form helices with a complementary single-stranded oligodeoxyadenylate; the two strands have a parallel orientation independently of whether or not an intercalating agent is attached to the oligothymidylate. (iii) At low salt concentration, beta oligothymidylates form a double helix with an oligodeoxyadenylate in which, as expected, the two strands are antiparallel; at high salt concentration, a triple helix is formed in which the second oligothymidylate is oriented parallel to the adenine-containing strand. These results show that it is possible to recognize an oligopurine.oligopyrimidine sequence in a DNA double helix via local triple-helix formation and to target photochemical reactions to specific sequences in both double-stranded and single-stranded nucleic acids.\r"

In this proteoglycan form, Ii may remain associated with Ia at the cell surface. Inhibitors that prevent the addition of glycosaminoglycan to Ii have been found to depress antigen-presenting function. Ii does not have multiple candidate glycosaminoglycan-attachment sites, and we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace a candidate serine glycosaminoglycan-acceptor site with alanine at position 201 in the murine Ii protein. Transfection of the normal or altered gene into Ii-negative COS-7 cells showed that equivalent amounts of core Ii protein and its acidic, terminally glycosylated forms were synthesized, but the Ala-201 mutant Ii did not give rise to Ii-CS. The mutant protein had apparently normal transport through the Golgi compartment and associated stably with Ia molecules. Thus, this mutation directly identifies the site of glycosaminoglycan addition and shows that it can be eliminated without adversely affecting the overall biosynthesis of Ii.\r"

The synthesis of desformyl[Ala3-15N][Val1]gramicidin A employed N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-N alpha-amino acids and completely avoided the use of acid. Since deblocking was done with piperidine and the peptide was removed from the resin by treatment with ethanolamine, this synthetic protocol prevented oxidation of the indole rings of this tryptophan-rich peptide and reduced truncations produced by acid hydrolysis. After formylation and purification by anion-exchange and high-pressure liquid chromatography, the peptide was obtained in an overall yield of 30%. Solid-state 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of this peptide and uniformly labeled [15N]gramicidin A' oriented in hydrated lipid bilayers have been obtained, allowing unambiguous assignment of the [15N]Ala3 resonance in the latter. The solid-state 15N nuclear magnetic resonance experiments provide evidence that [Val1]gramicidin A is rotating about an axis that is perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer and that the N--H axis is nearly parallel with the rotational axis. This study demonstrates that site-specifically labeled [15N]gramicidin A analogs prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis are valuable tools in the study of the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of samples in oriented lipid bilayers.\r"

In this paper we report the location of this regulatory sequence, determined by deletion analysis and the use of chimeric genes, transfected stably into the mouse myogenic cell line C2C12. The domain responsible for the reduction in beta-actin mRNA levels is at most 40 base pairs long and is located just 5' to the canonical polyadenylylation signal in the gene. Placement of this sequence in the corresponding 3' position both in the alpha-cardiac-actin gene and in the neomycin-resistance gene in pSV2-neo confers the beta-actin mRNA regulatory pattern when these constructs are stably introduced into C2C12 cells. Nuclear run-on experiments indicate that transcriptional control can account for the decrease observed in beta-actin mRNA levels during myogenesis for both the endogenous as well as the transfected beta-actin gene constructs. This 3' transcriptional control sequence is conserved in all of the vertebrate beta-actin genes sequenced and is not similar to any of the 3' processing-adenylylation or termination sequences described previously. This mode of gene regulation may reflect a more general mechanism involved in the process of gene suppression during development.\r"

The tet repressor, being expressed in the plant cells under the control of eukaryotic transcription signals, blocks transcription of a CaMV 35S promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) fusion gene when the two tet operators flank the \"TATA\" box. In the presence of the inducer tetracycline, expression is restored to full activity. Location of the operators 21 base pairs downstream of the transcription start site does not significantly affect transcription in the presence of the repressor. These experiments show that a prokaryotic regulatory protein can function in plant cells. The tet repressor-operator complex may be useful for specifically inducing transferred genes at different stages of plant development.\r"

The inositol glycan is apparently linked to the alpha carboxyl group of the aspartic acid through the ethanolamine.

  ".W": "The activity of the endogenous DNA topoisomerase type I (EC 5.99.1.2) can be quantified in situ by determining how efficiently the enzyme is trapped in a covalent complex with DNA upon lysis of nuclei with detergents. In this way, we can measure relative levels of topoisomerase binding to DNA at native sites in chromatin. Since the majority of topoisomerase I is localized in the nucleolus at rRNA genes, we have evaluated how low levels of actinomycin D, which terminate transcription of rRNA genes, affect the activity of topoisomerase I. In vivo, as well as in vitro with purified topoisomerase I, we have found that drug treatment extends the half-life of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex. Actinomycin D stabilizes the nicked intermediate in the cleavage and resealing reaction but otherwise does not significantly alter the strand-passing ability of topoisomerase I. Sequence-specific cleavages by topoisomerase I were stimulated by actinomycin D at identical sequences recognized by the enzyme in the absence of drug. The localization of topoisomerase I in the nucleolus, coupled with the observation that transcription in this organelle is highly sensitive to actinomycin D and camptothecin treatment, leads us to propose that topoisomerase I contributes to actinomycin D inhibition of transcription.\r"

We have isolated and determined the sequence of a cDNA clone containing the coding sequence of the cytoplasmic precursor to the alpha subunit of this enzyme together with stretches of nontranslated sequence at the 5' and 3' ends. The translated amino acid sequence indicates the presence of a 27-residue N-terminal signal sequence for mitochondrial targeting. The amino acid sequence of the mature alpha subunit shows an extraordinary degree of homology to the alpha subunit of Escherichia coli succinyl-CoA synthetase, with greater than 70% of the residues identical. This suggests that the fundamental differences in the quaternary structures and catalytic functions of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes must be attributable to differences in the beta subunits. mRNA that hybridizes to the cloned DNA is approximately equal to 1800 nucleotide residues in length, confirming that each of the two subunits is encoded separately and does not arise by proteolysis of a primary gene product containing both subunits of the mature protein.\r"

Observation of this heterologous desensitization required the assay of adenylyl cyclase with submillimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and low concentrations of epinephrine. Also, whereas previously there had been no evidence for any role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the desensitization of the WT beta-adrenergic receptor, our data comparing the characteristics of the desensitization in WT, kin-, and cyc- lymphoma cells [where kin- and cyc- refer to variants of S49 WT cells lacking cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (kin-) and the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (cyc-)] now suggest that cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the heterologous desensitization of adenylyl cyclase. Specifically, we found that only the WT cells exhibited epinephrine-induced heterologous desensitization. The kin- and cyc- cells exhibited only homologous desensitization, and much higher concentrations of epinephrine were required to elicit the homologous desensitization in the variants relative to the heterologous desensitization of the WT. Treatment of WT and cyc- cells with dibutyryl cAMP or treatment of WT with forskolin or PGE1 caused the heterologous desensitization of adenylyl cyclase, indicating that neither receptor occupancy nor activation of adenylyl cyclase was necessary for the heterologous desensitization.\r"

We find that the IRE consists of two genetically separable positive regulatory domains and an overlapping negative control sequence. We propose that the beta-interferon gene is switched off in uninduced cells by a repressor that blocks the interaction between one of the two positive regulatory sequences and a specific transcription factor. Induction would then lead to inactivation or displacement of the repressor and binding of transcription factors to both positive regulatory domains.\r"

  ".W": "Efficient expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) genes requires both host and viral proteins and is dependent on DNA sequences in the proviral long terminal repeats (LTRs). We have used DNase I-protection assays (footprinting) to construct a map of protein-DNA interactions over a 250-nucleotide region of the LTR upstream of the start site for viral RNA synthesis. We find that a host factor (host expression factor 1, or HEF-1) binds to the imperfect 21-nucleotide repeats that have previously been implicated in HTLV-I gene expression. HEF-1 binding activity is present in preparations from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines. However, the boundaries of the protected regions and the presence of a flanking DNase-hypersensitive site vary with cell type. Several regions of binding are detected in addition to the HEF-1 sites, including a complex group of sites 40-90 nucleotides upstream of the RNA start site. A comparison of HTLV-I-transformed T lymphocytes that do and do not express the viral trans-activating protein p40xI shows that none of the observed features of the DNase I footprint pattern correlate directly with the presence of this protein in the extract. These results suggest (i) that the primary recognition of promoter elements in the HTLV-I LTR involves specific interactions with host-cell proteins and (ii) that p40xI influences the activity of one or more of these proteins, rather than interacting directly with the DNA.\r"

Purified modulator inhibits glucocorticoid-receptor complex activation and stabilizes the steroid-binding ability of the unoccupied glucocorticoid receptor. Since these activities are shared by exogenous sodium molybdate, modulator appears to be the endogenous factor that sodium molybdate mimics. In this report, we present additional evidence for the mechanism of action of purified modulator. (i) Molybdate and modulator inhibit receptor activation as measured by DNA-cellulose binding, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and Sepharose 4B gel filtration. (ii) The ability of molybdate and modulator to inhibit receptor activation and stabilize the unoccupied receptor appears to be additive. (iii) Scatchard analysis of heat-destabilized unoccupied receptors indicates that the number of steroid-binding sites is reduced during destabilization, whereas the steroid dissociation constant remains unchanged. Molybdate and modulator stabilize the receptor by maintaining the number of steroid-binding sites. (iv) Molybdate and modulator do not inhibit alkaline phosphatase-induced destabilization of the unoccupied receptor. However, alkaline phosphatase-induced destabilization is reversed by the addition of dithiothreitol in the presence, but not in the absence, of molybdate or modulator. These results suggest that the mechanism of action for modulator is identical to that of sodium molybdate, and we propose that modulator is the endogenous molybdate factor for the glucocorticoid receptor.\r"

Here we report that the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA (clone 465) derived from one of these immediate early genes (hereafter called jun-B) encodes a protein homologous to that encoded by the avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene v-jun. Homology between the jun-B and v-jun proteins is in two regions: one near the N terminus and the other at the C terminus. The latter sequence was shown by Vogt et al. [Vogt, P. K., Bos, T. J. & Doolittle, R. F. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 3316-3319] to have regions of sequence similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional regulatory protein GCN4 and to the oncogenic protein fos. Southern blots of human, mouse, and chicken DNA demonstrate that jun-B and c-jun are different genes and that there may be other vertebrate genes related to jun-B and c-jun. These findings suggest that there is a jun family of genes encoding related transcriptional regulatory proteins. The jun-B protein, and perhaps other members of the jun family, may play a role in regulating the genomic response to growth factors.\r"

The positions of intervening sequences closely match those of the related B-chain (c-sis) gene on chromosome 22. In situ hybridization was used to localize the PDGF A-chain gene to the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p21-p22). Within the (G + C)-rich 5' region, a single transcriptional start site was identified approximately equal to 36 base pairs downstream of a TATAA consensus promoter element. The three size classes of A-chain mRNA probably arise by selection of alternative poly(A) sites in exon 7, but only a single consensus AATAAA signal was identified in this region. Two functionally different A-chain precursors, which differ by the presence or absence of a basic C terminus, are generated as a result of alternative mRNA splicing events, which include or exclude exon 6. This and other structural features of the A-chain gene suggest that PDGF expression may be modulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.\r"

  ".U": "88144464\r", 
  ".W": "The lifetimes of the unitary currents from ion channels, as revealed from single-channel recording, are traditionally thought to follow exponential or multiexponential distributions. The interpretation of these event-time distributions is that the gating process follows Markov kinetics among a small number of states. There is recent evidence, however, that certain systems exhibit distributions that follow power laws or functions related to power laws. Likewise, it has been suggested that data sets that appear to be multiexponential may be fit to simple power laws as well. In this paper we propose a different view of ion-channel-gating kinetics that is consistent with these recent experimental observations. We retain the Markovian nature of the kinetics, but, in contrast to the traditional models, we suggest that ion-channel proteins have a very large number of states all of similar energy. Gating, therefore, resembles a diffusion process. We show that our simplest one-dimensional model exhibits single-channel distributions that follow power laws of the form t-a, where 1/2 less than or equal to a less than or equal to 3/2. Exponents determined from recent experiments approximately fall within this range. We believe that this model is consistent with modern views of protein dynamics and, thus, may provide a key to the molecular details of the gating process.\r"

Electrophoretic analysis indicated that several forms of the large subunit were generated during proteolysis but that the small subunit was resistant. Three tryptic peptides were isolated and characterized after digestion of the activated enzyme; the tryptic-sensitive sites were identified at Lys-8, Lys-14, and Lys-466 of the large subunit. Tryptic digestion of the enzyme complexed with the reaction-intermediate analogue released only two peptides by hydrolysis at Lys-8 and at Lys-14. The loss of susceptibility of Lys-466 to trypsin may be the result of a conformational change that limits the accessibility of the carboxyl-terminal region after binding of the reaction-intermediate analogue. Analysis of the amino-terminal tryptic peptide by composition and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry demonstrated that the actual amino-terminal residue is proline at position 3 of the DNA-deduced sequence and that this proline is blocked with an N-acetyl moiety. Thus, posttranslational processing of the chloroplast-encoded large subunit of the enzyme must occur to remove Met-1 and Ser-2 and to acetylate the amino terminus.\r"

  ".W": "Growing hyphae of Achlya bisexualis drive an electric current through themselves, such that positive charge flows into the apical region (the anterior 300 micron) and exits distally along the hyphal trunk. They also generate a gradient of extracellular pH, such that the medium surrounding the apex is slightly alkaline whereas that along the hyphal trunk is acid. To explore the genesis of these gradients and their relationship to polarized extension, we examined the effects of changes in the composition of the growth medium. The transcellular electric current was most pronounced in medium rich in amino acids. In leaner medium, containing limited amounts of amino acids or none at all, the current was attenuated or absent. We interpret the results to mean that inward current represents H+/amino acid symport, mediated by porters that are preferentially localized in the apical region. Apical alkalinity may be due to ammonia production. Outward current, and perhaps also the generation of metabolic acid, reflects the distribution of the H+-ATPase, which is excluded from the apex but is abundant along the hyphal trunk. Thanks to the spatial segregation of transport functions, protons characteristically flow into the apical region. However, since hyphae grow apically and at the same rate despite wide variations in current pattern, the flow of electric charge through the hyphae cannot be required to polarize extension or to localize the tip.\r"

To determine whether TGF-beta is involved in hepatocyte growth responses in vivo, we measured the levels of TGF-beta mRNA in normal liver and during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats. TGF-beta mRNA increases in the regenerating liver and reaches a peak (about 8 times higher than basal levels) after the major wave of hepatocyte cell division and mitosis have taken place and after the peak expression of the ras protooncogenes. Although hepatocytes from normal and regenerating liver respond to TGF-beta, they do not synthesize TGF-beta mRNA. Instead, the message is present in liver nonparenchymal cells and is particularly abundant in cell fractions enriched for endothelial cells. TGF-beta inhibits epidermal growth factor-induced DNA synthesis in vitro in hepatocytes from normal or regenerating liver, although the dose-response curves vary according to the culture medium used. We conclude that TGF-beta may function as the effector of an inhibitory paracrine loop that is activated during liver regeneration, perhaps to prevent uncontrolled hepatocyte proliferation.\r"

Leukotriene B4 stimulated a low level of superoxide production that plateaued at 60 sec, whereas with fMet-Leu-Phe the response continued to increase for 5 min. Both agents produced equivalent initial rises in diacylglycerol (acyl2Gro) (less than or equal to 30 sec); however, only fMet-Leu-Phe induced a second increase of acyl2Gro peaking at ca. 120 sec. Both chemoattractants also caused an equivalent initial (less than or equal to 10 sec) rise in intracellular calcium; however, the elevation induced by fMet-Leu-Phe was more sustained. We sought to determine the biochemical mechanisms underlying these discrepancies. Superoxide production and the second phase of acyl2Gro generation were both inhibited ca. 56% by depleting extracellular calcium or ca. 79% by buffering intracellular calcium. Cytochalasin B greatly enhanced the respiratory burst, acyl2Gro production, and calcium influx, but not inositolphospholipid turnover in PMNs stimulated with chemoattractants. These data indicate that sequential metabolic pathways activate the respiratory burst in PMNs stimulated by chemoattractants. The response is initiated by inositolpolyphospholipid hydrolysis, which results in rapid (less than or equal to 5 sec) calcium mobilization from intracellular stores and acyl2Gro release (peak at ca. 30 sec). To fully activate the respiratory burst, the chemoattractant must also trigger calcium influx, which leads to a sustained cytosolic calcium elevation. This supports a prolonged new phase of acyl2Gro production that is independent of inositolphospholipid hydrolysis and is correlated with superoxide production.\r"

After a prescribed history of restricted population size, the replicate populations are expanded, and the covariance between ancestors and descendents is quantified in terms of descent measures and genetic components in the initial population as a means of determining the additive variance within populations. Several dominance components including joint dominance effects of loci contribute to the additive variance, some of which can be negative. There is always a positive contribution of additive by additive variance to the additive variance within populations, which can be large. With the new definitions of components of genetic variance within populations, selection response is formulated in the same manner as for the initial random mating population, but the components have been modified considerably by the restricted population size.\r"

The variability of the breakpoint between 3p11.2 and 3p13 and the absence of a consistently translocated segment from another chromosome suggests a genetic-loss mechanism, while the activation of a dominant oncogene appears less likely. Together with the previously demonstrated involvement of the 3p14.2 region in a familial case, these findings suggest that RCCs may arise by the deletion of a \"recessive cancer gene,\" as do retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor.

  ".W": "We have constructed a retrovirus expression vector that carries the murine mdr cDNA transcribed under the control of the human H4 histone promoter to examine the feasibility of efficiently transferring a multidrug resistance phenotype to cells without requiring drug selection. This approach will facilitate the transfer of mdr cDNA to hematopoietic progenitor cells for the study of multidrug resistance in vivo. The retrovirus vector pHmdr has been used for transmission and expression of the mdr cDNA in initially drug-sensitive NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Selection of pHmdr infectants in the cytotoxic agents colchicine or doxorubicin gave rise to highly multidrug-resistant colonies containing a single gene copy of the vector. Moreover, in the analysis of 12 cloned unselected NIH 3T3 cell infectants, a multidrug resistance phenotype was conferred by as few as two copies of the pHmdr vector. Overexpression of the mdr cDNA in drug-selected and unselected pHmdr infectants was directly related to cell survival in three cytotoxic agents tested. These results hold significant implications for the study of multidrug resistance in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "88144488\r", 
  ".W": "A method has been developed by which rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells can be permeabilized to small molecules while maintaining their ability to degranulate in response to aggregation of IgE receptors. alpha-Toxin was isolated from culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus by precipitation with (NH4)2SO4 and chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. The isolated toxin binds to the plasma membrane of RBL cells and polymerizes to form a transmembrane pore that allows small molecules (Mr less than 1000), but not macromolecules, to diffuse freely across the membrane. There was no spontaneous release of the contents of RBL cell secretory granules during permeabilization or subsequent incubations. Substantial IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis occurred in the absence of Ca2+, and degranulation was maximal at 0.1-1.0 microM Ca2+, the physiologically important range of Ca2+ concentrations. Using these permeabilized cells, small molecules (i.e., substrates and inhibitors of various enzymes) normally excluded by the plasma membrane can be introduced into the cell. Moreover, the intracellular concentration of ions (such as Ca2+) can be precisely controlled. This method will allow a detailed examination of the individual biochemical events involved in degranulation of mast cells.\r"

Infectious center assays indicated that the low level of viral replication observed by virus yield assay occurred from a fraction of the cells in the mixed cultures. Virus-specific immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization documented the presence of HCMV-specific protein and nucleic acid, respectively, in a morphologically distinct cell type. These cells were purified, were identified as kidney mesangial cells, and were observed to support efficient HCMV replication. Our research identifies mesangial cells as a renal cell type that supports HCMV replication and provides evidence to implicate these cells in the pathogenesis of HCMV-induced renal disease.\r"

The HIV promoter sequences necessary for trans-activation by EBV do not include the tat-responsive sequences. In addition, in contrast to the other herpesvirus trans-activators previously studied, the EBV BamHI MLF1 gene product appears to function in part by a posttranscriptional mechanism, since it increases pHIV-CAT protein activity more than it increases HIV-CAT mRNA. This ability of an EBV gene product to activate HIV gene expression may have biologic consequences in persons coinfected with both viruses.\r"

Neither M- nor M+ streptococci directly affected the formation or dissociation of the surface-bound C3b,Bb or the inactivation of surface-bound C3b by factor I. However, the activity of the serum control protein of the alternative complement pathway, factor H, in controlling streptococcus-bound C3b and C3b,Bb was 6-8 times stronger on M+ organisms than on M- organisms. Furthermore, M+ streptococci of different serotypes and purified streptococcal M6 protein were shown to selectively bind factor H, the dissociation constants ranging from 4.5 X 10(-6) M to 6 X 10(-7) M. We conclude that the antiphagocytic activity of streptococcal M protein may be due to complement inhibition mediated by the binding of factor H. Binding of a regulatory protein appears to be a previously unrecognized route by which a pathogen is able to evade alternative pathway activation.\r"

The limits of detection were about one infected cell in a background of a million noninfected cells. The luciferase assay was about 1000-fold more sensitive than that of beta-galactosidase. Our findings show that the luciferase assay can be conveniently used to follow viral gene expression and virus dissemination both in cell cultures and in tissues of infected animals.\r"

After prelabeling with 32PO4, exposure of the chromaffin cells to acetylcholine increased the phosphorylation of a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein and a Mr approximately equal to 60,000 protein (tyrosine hydroxylase), visualized after separation of total cellular proteins in naDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to three known phosphoproteins (\"100-kDa,\" \"87-kDa,\" and protein III) revealed an acetylcholine-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins. These three proteins were also shown to be present in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by immunolabeling techniques. \"100-kDa\" is a Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III, \"87-kDa\" is a Mr approximately equal to 87,000 protein selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and protein III is a phosphoprotein doublet of Mr approximately equal to 74,000 (IIIa) and Mr approximately equal to 55,000 (IIIb) phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I. Furthermore, 100-kDa was shown to be identical to the Mr approximately equal to 100,000 protein whose phosphorylation was increased by acetylcholine treatment. The acetylcholine-dependent increase in phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 100-kDa, 87-kDa, and protein III required extracellular calcium and was mimicked by nicotine, veratridine, elevated K+, and calcium ionophore A23187, but not by muscarine. In addition, forskolin increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 100-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 87-kDa. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, 87-kDa, and protein III, but not that of 100-kDa. The data demonstrate that cholinergic activation of chromaffin cells increases the phosphorylation of several proteins and that several protein kinase systems may be involved in these effects.\r"

The average calcium content of spine cisterns in rapidly excised slices (6.7 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg of dry weight +/- SEM) was higher than the average calcium content of spine cisterns in brain slices incubated without stimulation for 1-2 hr before direct freezing (2.5 +/- 0.4 mmol/kg of dry weight). Depolarization of incubated cerebellar slices by isotonic 55 mM KCl resulted in the accumulation within spine cisterns of very high amounts of calcium or isotonically substituted strontium, both derived from the extracellular fluid. These results suggest that one function of spine cisterns is to sequester free calcium that enters the spine through ligand-gated or voltage-gated channels during synaptic transmission.\r"

They were then homogenized, and the molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase were analyzed by sucrose gradient sedimentation. We observed an increased proportion of the globular monomeric G1 form, and to a lesser extent of the dimeric G2 and tetrameric membranous G4 forms, of acetylcholinesterase in the glycyl-L-glutamine-treated compared with the control cultures. There was only a small increase in the total acetylcholinesterase activity and no significant variation in the activity of the metabolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. It therefore seems likely that glycyl-L-glutamine, or the endogenous neurotrophic factor, maintains acetylcholinesterase in the preganglionically denervated ganglia in vivo by specifically increasing the biosynthesis of the monomeric G1 form, but not that of other proteins; these trophic factors do not seem to promote the polymerization of G1 into the more complex G2 and G4 forms.\r"

Clones of one medium-abundance mRNA were recovered almost quantitatively. Two of the lower-abundance mRNAs were expressed at levels reduced by a factor of 10 in Alzheimer disease relative to normal human cortex.

Production of the mitogenic supernatant was time- and dose-dependent with a maximal Schwann cell-proliferative response from supernatants after 48-hr incubation of cultured macrophages with myelin-enriched fraction (200 micrograms of protein per ml). The response was specific for myelin membrane: supernatants derived from macrophages incubated with axolemma, liver microsomes, polystyrene beads, or lipopolysaccharide were not mitogenic. Lysosomal processing of the myelin membrane was necessary for the production of the mitogenic factor, which was shown to be heat labile and trypsin sensitive. There was no species specificity because myelin membranes isolated from the central and peripheral nervous systems of rat, bovine, and human were equally potent in eliciting mitogenic supernatant. However, supernatants derived from central nervous system myelin membranes were two to three times more mitogenic than those obtained from peripheral nervous system fractions of the same species. Previous observations that myelin is mitogenic for cultured Schwann cells may, in part, involve the intermediate processing of myelin by macrophages that are present in Schwann cell cultures. These results suggest that macrophages play a crucial role in Schwann cell proliferation during Wallerian degeneration.\r"

Although the sequence of this acidic glycoprotein has been elucidated recently, its biological function is unknown. Here we have purified CGA from chromaffin granules; the final preparation contained the 74-kDa native CGA together with two degradation products--three bands near 60 kDa and a single band of 43 kDa. This preparation was found to inhibit (a maximum inhibition of 60% at 1 microM) the nicotine-induced, but not the high K+-evoked, catecholamine secretion from bovine chromaffin cells maintained in primary culture. Spontaneous release was also affected in the nanomolar CGA protein concentration range. The observation that the inhibitory effect is strictly dependent on a preincubation step together with the modification of the CGA protein profile during this preincubation step suggests that the degradation peptide(s) rather than the 74-kDa native CGA--the approximately equal to 60-kDa bands or the 43-kDa singlet band--is actually involved in secretory cell activity. This was demonstrated by using trypsin-generated peptides that were inhibitory without the preincubation period. The finding that unprocessed CGA is not active on chromaffin cell secretion suggests that this molecule is a precursor of a peptide(s) that is able to regulate catecholamine secretion. Thus, the present data suggest that a CGA-derived peptide(s) could exert a feedback control on chromaffin cell secretory activity--a mechanism that might be of importance during stress situations.\r"

Their map positions conform to the Poisson distribution, unlike most of the 436 natural breaks mapped in 105 closely related species endemic to Hawaii. Genome element E is longer and has more induced breaks than the others. Both in Hawaiian and related species groups, this element shows increased polymorphism and fixation of naturally occurring inversions. The X chromosome (element A) also accumulates many natural breaks; the majority of the resulting aberrations become fixed rather than remain as polymorphisms. Although size may play a small role in initial break distribution, the major effects relative to the establishment of a rearrangement in natural populations are ascribed to the interaction of selection and drift. Nonconformance of the natural breaks to the Poisson distribution appears to be due to the tendency for breaks to accumulate both in the proximal euchromatic portion of each arm and in heterochromatic regions that are not replicated in the polytene chromosomes.\r"

Since the actual samples employed differed among the genetic systems studied, the genetic distances were computed separately for each system, as were matrices of geographic distances and of linguistic distances based on membership in the same language family or phylum. Significant matrix correlations between genetics and geography were found for the majority of systems; somewhat less frequent are significant correlations between genetics and language. The effects of the two factors can be separated by means of partial matrix correlations. These show significant values for both genetics and geography, language kept constant, and genetics and language, geography kept constant, with a tendency for the former to be higher. These findings demonstrate that speakers of different language families in Europe differ genetically and that this difference remains even after geographic differentiation is allowed for. The greater effect of geography than of language may be due to the several factors that bring about spatial differentiation in human populations.\r"

Seven hundred twelve junior high school students (mean age, 13.5 years) were surveyed for self-report of personal experience with abuse, certain health behaviors, and self-esteem. Physical and/or sexual abuse was reported by 18.3% of students. Both types of abuse were associated with the following behaviors: running away; considering hurting oneself; suicide attempts; and the use of drugs, pot (marijuana), cigarettes, and laxatives. No clinically significant relationships were found between abuse and report of anger, sadness, or self-esteem. These data suggested that some feelings and behaviors were common among all adolescents sampled, while others were more common among abused adolescents. Recognition of strong associations should help direct clinical management. The results of this study confirm findings from some previous reports and indicate the need for further studies of children who are not in a clinical setting.\r"

At this time, the patient had no response to caloric stimulation or to sinusoidal rotation below 0.2 Hz but normal gain (peak slow-phase eye velocity/peak chair velocity) above 0.4 Hz (phase lead increased). Gaze holding, saccades, smooth pursuit, and optokinetic nystagmus were normal, but optokinetic-after-nystagmus disappeared. The other 2 patients (combined brainstem-cerebellar atrophy) had impaired gaze holding, abnormal smooth pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus, and absent optokinetic-after-nystagmus. VOR gain to step and high-frequency sinusoidal stimuli was increased. The neural mechanism that normally prolongs the VOR time constant may have reduced it in our patients.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed a series of isotopic infusions both in normal volunteers (N = 16) and in sarcoma patients (N = 7). Using the primed-constant infusion of stable or radioisotopes we have determined the rates of glucose turnover, glucose oxidation, glucose recycling, and net protein catabolism (NPC). In addition, we have measured VO2 and VCO2. The values for VCO2 and VO2 were higher in the patients than in the volunteers (mean VO2 values in volunteers and patients: 107 +/- 13 and 158 +/- 13 mumol/kg/min, respectively). The basal rate of glucose appearance in the sarcoma patients was twice the value seen in the volunteers (28.3 +/- 3.5 vs. 13.9 +/- 0.3 mumol/kg/min). Glucose infusion in the volunteers resulted in virtually total suppression of endogenous glucose production, while in the patients glucose infusion induced only a 30% suppression of endogenous glucose production (p less than 0.01). The rate of glucose clearance in the patients was approximately twice the value seen in the volunteers [5.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.1 mL/kg/min (p less than 0.01)]. The per cent of glucose uptake oxidized in the patients was significantly less than in the volunteers [22% vs. 36% (p less than 0.05)], and the per cent of glucose uptake that was recycled was significantly higher in the patients [55% vs. 10% (p less than 0.01)]. In addition, the basal rate of net protein loss was increased twofold in the patients [3.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.4 g (protein)/kg/d (p less than 0.01)], and in contrast to the situation in the volunteers there was no suppression in the rate of net protein loss when the patients were infused with glucose. The basal insulin concentration and the insulin response to glucose infusion in the patients were similar to that of the volunteers, but the plasma cortisol level was similar in volunteers and in the patients (p less than 0.05). We conclude from these studies the following: (1) Sarcoma patients have significantly elevated rates of glucose production and glucose clearance, but they have an impaired capacity to directly oxidize either endogenous or infused glucose, coupled with an increased rate of glucose recycling. (2) Sarcoma patients have an elevated metabolic rate and are catabolic. In addition, in contrast with normal volunteers, glucose infusion does not result in a suppression of protein loss.\r"

  ".U": "88150200\r", 
  ".W": "Thirty-four patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (median age 37 years, range 20 to 69 years) received induction treatment between 1974 and 1985 with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and an anthracycline. Bone marrow hypercellularity was present at the time of diagnosis in all patients, although the median peripheral leukocyte count was 2,600/microL. A second course of induction therapy consisting of further ara-C and anthracycline was initiated 15 days after the start of treatment if bone marrow hypocellularity could not be documented. Karyotypic analysis of bone marrow blasts was performed on 15 of 34 patients; 11 of 15 had abnormalities in chromosomes 15 and/or 17. Twenty-nine of 34 (85%) patients had laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Of the 29 patients surviving 14 days, 24 (83%) received a second course of induction therapy. Complete remission was achieved in 25 of 34 (74%) patients, with four of 25 (16%) requiring one course of induction chemotherapy and 21 of 25 (84%) receiving two courses. Bone marrow specimens obtained 15 days after the start of therapy from the 25 patients who eventually attained complete remission showed the continued presence of dysplastic promyelocytes in 21 cases; three specimens were technically inadequate and only one was truly devoid of promyelocytes. Seventeen of 25 (68%) patients still had persistence of abnormal bone marrow promyelocytes seven or more days after the second course of therapy. Patients in complete remission received various forms of postremission therapy. Ten of the 25 (40%) completely responding patients remain alive in continuous complete remission. Neither the absence of bone marrow hypocellularity nor the persistence of dysplastic promyelocytes during induction exerted any influence on the probability for survival. These findings confirm and extend prior reports that complete remission in APL, in contrast to other subtypes of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), can frequently be achieved without bone marrow aplasia. Whether this observation signifies that complete remission in APL is due to leukemic cell differentiation or selective cytotoxicity is unknown. The absence of therapy-induced bone marrow hypoplasia in APL is not an absolute indication of induction failure or a poor ultimate prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) contains sequences from chromosome 9, including the ABL protooncogene, that have been translocated to the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of chromosome 22, giving rise to a bcr-ABL fusion gene, whose product has been implicated in the genesis of CML. Although chromosome 22 translocation breakpoints in CML virtually always occur within the 5.8-kilobase (kb) bcr, chromosome 9 breakpoints have been identified within the known limits of ABL in only a few instances. For a better understanding of the variability of the breakpoints on chromosome 9, we studied the CML cell line BV173. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), large-scale maps of the t(9;22) junctions were constructed. The chromosome 9 breakpoint was shown to have occurred within an ABL intron, 160 kb upstream of the v-abl homologous sequences, but still 35 kb downstream of the 5'-most ABL exon. bcr-ABL and ABL-bcr fusion genes were demonstrated on the Ph1 and the 9q+ chromosomes, respectively; both of these genes are expressed. These results suggest that the 9;22 translocation breakpoints in CML consistently occur within the limits of the large ABL gene. RNA splicing, sometimes of very large regions, appears to compensate for the variability in breakpoint location. These studies show that PFGE is a powerful new tool for the analysis of chromosomal translocations in human malignancies.\r"

The specific ferritin H-chain binding was saturable, and cells showed 17,000 to 23,000 binding sites per cell. The affinity constant measured at 37 degrees C was of 3 x 10(8) M-1. Treatment with pronase eliminated the specific binding. The binding sites were expressed in a high number during the cellular exponential phase of growth and progressively decreased to disappear when cells reached the plateau phase. Treatment of the cells with desferrioxamine increased recombinant H-ferritin binding, while iron had little effect. K562 cells induced to differentiate by hemin failed to bind ferritin H. Ferritin H-chain binding capacity is present on various cell lines such as HL60, lung cancer, and hepatoma cells. Analysis of the binding sites by western blotting showed a peptide with apparent mol wt of about 100 kd.\r"

  ".W": "In blood coagulation on endothelium, an unperturbed vascular endothelial cell surface apparently provides activity equivalent to the phospholipid needed for generation of factor Xa and thrombin in soluble systems. Phospholipid in soluble systems also markedly enhances the ability of factor Xa to activate factor VII; therefore we investigated the influence of an unperturbed monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) upon factor VII activation. HUVEC were found to augment factor Xa-catalyzed activation of factor VII. This appeared to result from the binding of trace amounts of factor Xa to the cells. Adding active site-inhibited factor Xa to reaction mixtures, but not factor X, abolished the enhanced activation. Adding either anti-factor V antibodies or exogenous factor Va had no effect upon reaction rates. Thus factor Va does not function as a cofactor for the reaction. In further experiments the effect upon activation of factor VII and prothrombin was studied by varying the order of addition of factor Xa and factor Va to supernatants of HUVEC monolayers. Evidence was obtained that HUVEC, unlike platelets, possess a functional factor Xa binding site that is independent of factor Va. Since phospholipid is the only known cofactor for factor Xa/Ca2+-induced activation of factor VII, the demonstration of enhanced activation of factor VII in the presence of unperturbed cultured HUVEC supports a hypothesis that the functional equivalent of procoagulant phospholipid is available on the luminal surface of vascular endothelium in vivo.\r"

The atypical grades of the epithelium were histologically classified into five groups: normal epithelium, Group 1; mild atypism, nonmalignant, Group 2; moderate atypism, borderline, Group 3; severe atypism, possibly malignant, Group 4; and apparent carcinoma, Group 5. The incidences of each group in 576 autopsy cases were 65.8%, 30.0%, 3.1%, 0.9%, and 0.2, respectively. The atypical epithelia were observed with the highest incidence in the common pancreaticobiliary channel. The immunohistochemical stainings for cancer-associated antigens (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9]) and histochemical stainings for mucin (periodic acid-Schiff [PAS] and alcian blue [AB], pH 2.5 and pH 1.0) revealed that most of the Group 1 and 2 epithelia were negative for CEA and positive for AB, pH 2.5. Group 3 and 4 epithelia were negative for both CEA and AB, and Group 5 epithelia were positive for CEA but negative for AB (chi-square test, P less than 0.01). A combination of CEA and AB pH 2.5 stainings may be helpful in the histologic diagnosis of normal epithelium to mild atypism, moderate to severe atypism, and carcinoma. The study on the relationships between atypical epithelia showed that some carcinomas of the papilla of Vater may arise from atypical epithelia.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA content of osteosarcomas, and of giant cell tumors, osteoblastomas, aneurysmal bone cysts, and fibrous dysplasias was determined by cytophotometry. Out of 158 tumors, 141 were histologically noncontroversial, whereas 17 posed diagnostic difficulties. In the noncontroversial group all 41 benign tumors had a diploid (normal) DNA content. Ninety-two of 96 high-grade osteosarcomas were hyperploid (increased DNA content). The four analyzed low-grade parosteal osteosarcomas were diploid. Among 17 diagnostically controversial cases, nine were primarily diagnosed and treated as benign. Three of these patients, nevertheless, exhibited a malignant clinical course and two had local recurrence. All five proved to have hyperploid tumors. The four nonrecurrent lesions were diploid. Of eight cases primarily evaluated as malignant, one died and two developed local recurrence. These three patients had hyperploid tumors. Among the five nonrecurrent lesions, two were hyperploid and three diploid. Hence, in the diagnostically controversial group, recurrence or death was consistently related to hyperploidy. The current study shows that the vast majority of high-grade osteosarcomas are hyperploid. Benign bone tumors, which may be mixed up histologically with osteosarcoma, are diploid. Routine DNA analysis of primary bone tumors, as an adjunct to histopathologic assessment, can be employed to obtain diagnostic confirmation. In cases presenting histopathologic difficulties, ploidy determination may provide decisive diagnostic information.\r"

The outcome of 357 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML was analysed from the time of development of suspected features of accelerated disease. Median survivals shorter than 18 months were associated with the appearance of any of the following: cytogenetic clonal evolution; extramedullary disease; peripheral blasts greater than or equal to 15%, peripheral blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%, or peripheral basophils greater than or equal to 20%; platelet count less than 1.0 X 10(5)/microliters; marrow blasts greater than or equal to 15%, marrow blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%, or marrow basophils greater than or equal to 20%. Relative hazard ratios, or risk of death per unit time, were calculated based on the relative survivals of patients who did or did not develop the particular feature of accelerated disease, after accounting for the time to development of the characteristic. Further analysis identified five features that have additive independent prognostic importance: cytogenetic clonal evolution; peripheral blasts greater than or equal to 15%; peripheral basophils greater than or equal to 20%; peripheral blasts and promyelocytes greater than or equal to 30%; and thrombocytopenia. By providing an objective estimate of prognosis in accelerated disease, the model identifies patients in need of different therapeutic interventions before the development of blastic crisis.\r"

  ".W": "As part of epidemiologic studies of human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-associated malignancies in Jamaica, the authors evaluated 26 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma for the presence of integrated HTLV-I provirus in their malignant cells. Fifteen of 26 patients had integrated provirus. All 15 also were HTLV-I antibody positive. Eleven patients did not have integrated provirus, and all 11 were antibody negative. All of the antibody-positive cases had onset of their disease in adulthood (age range, 21-57 years) as opposed to the broad age range of negative cases (4-66 years). Clinical features which were more common in provirus positive than negative patients included leukemic phase, skin involvement, and hypercalcemia, which are all features frequently seen in HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The presence of skin involvement, circulating malignant cells, abnormal liver function tests, or the presence of two or more of these four features were statistically significantly different between virus-positive and virus-negative cases. Although the survival of positive cases (6 months) was shorter than that of negative cases (9 months), this was not statistically significant. The only significant determinant of survival was hypercalcemia, with those who developed hypercalcemia at some point in their disease course, independent of their HTLV-I status, surviving a mean of 5 months as compared to a mean of 17.5 months in those who never became hypercalcemic. The six HTLV-I-positive lymphomas that underwent cell typing were all primarily OKT4 positive, whereas two HTLV-I antibody-negative cases that were typed were B-cell lymphomas.\r"

Both 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (MTX) were prescribed in doses significantly lower than those recommended (75 mg/m2 daily 6-mercaptopurine; 20 mg/m2 weekly MTX) during maintenance therapy. Of 212 evaluated patients, patients who had relapses (n = 101) received significantly less MTX compared with patients who did not have relapses (n = 111) during the first 2 years of maintenance therapy. In the group of standard-risk patients who received the same induction therapy (n = 92), 11 of 17 who received less than 50% of the recommended MTX dose (64%) and 28 of 75 who received greater than 50% of the dose (37%) had relapses (P less than 0.05). The two groups had comparable periods of interruption of MTX therapy. Further analysis revealed that the lower maintenance dose stemmed from a continuous low prescribed dose and not from more frequent interruption of therapy in relapse. Physicians' inability or failure to adhere to the recommended protocol was associated with a higher relapse rate of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Improved physicians' compliance may improve the prognosis of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "PTH receptors on two stable clonal rat osteosarcoma cell lines, ROS 17/2 and ROS 17/2.8, were characterized using an HPLC-purified, synthetic, sulfur-free, radioiodinated analog of bovine PTH, [Nle8,Nle18,Tyr,34]bovine PTH-(1-34)amide. PTH binding is specific for PTH agonists and antagonists and is dependent on the time and temperature of incubation. There is an excellent correlation between binding affinities of PTH agonists and antagonists in these intact cell systems with those in canine renal membranes. Peptides unrelated to PTH do not bind. Both ROS 17/2 and 17/2.8 have a single class of saturable, high affinity PTH binding sites that, by kinetic analysis and Scatchard analysis of saturation and competition studies, has a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.8-1.4 nM. Bmax is approximately 36,000 and 72,000 sites per cell in ROS 17/2 and 17/2.8, respectively. A close correlation was found between the binding of PTH agonists to their receptors in ROS 17/2 cells with their relative biological potencies as measured by stimulation of adenylate cyclase in plasma membranes prepared from these cells. Prolonged treatment of ROS 17/2 and 17/2.8 cells with PTH agonists results in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of available cell-surface binding sites, without alterations in Kd. PTH antagonists do not regulate PTH receptors. Regulation of PTH receptors by PTH agonists is dependent on the dose and time of exposure to ligand over a dose range of 10(-8) to 10(-11) M. Cells exposed to agonists (greater than or equal to 10(-8) M) for 48 h show maximally decreased receptor number; continued exposure to agonists (greater than or equal to 10(-8) M) does not further decrease PTH receptor number, which remains constant at about 15% of control values. Agonist-induced down-regulation occurs with less than 10(-11) M agonists, a concentration less than 10% of the minimal dose detected by direct ligand competition. Treatment of ROS 17/2 cells with PTH agonists results in a dose- and time-dependent decrease of PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase. This agonist-induced desensitization correlates closely with the decreased availability of PTH receptors: it is maximal in cells exposed to agonists (greater than 10(-8) M) for 48 h and also does not decrease further with continued exposure of the cells to agonist. Future studies with these stable ROS cell lines should permit detailed analysis of the biochemical mechanisms underlying homologous and heterologous regulation of PTH receptors and desensitization and sensitization of the adenylate cyclase response.\r"

Experiments were performed both without and with indomethacin sufficient to inhibit ex vivo release of prostaglandin E2 by 56% +/- 9% (2.5 mg/kg) or 86% +/- 4% (10 mg/kg). Twenty percent ethanol significantly reduced both macroscopic and histologic signs of injury caused by subsequent exposure to 100% ethanol whether or not the rats were pretreated with indomethacin. Twenty percent ethanol itself caused extensive superficial disruption of the surface epithelium, so that about half of the mucosa was covered by desquamated debris, but did not stimulate prostaglandin release. We conclude that adaptive cytoprotection still occurs after doses of indomethacin sufficient to cause a profound depression of prostaglandin E2 release. The possibility that it could be due to formation of a protective covering of surface debris is worth further investigation.\r"

Mean maximal gastric acid output fell from 36.0 +/- 3.3 (SEM) to 30.1 +/- 2.9 mmol/h (p less than 0.05), although mean basal acid output was not significantly affected (8.3 +/- 2.1 and 7.2 +/- 1.7 mmol/h, respectively). Mean fasting serum gastrin concentrations increased from 19.2 +/- 3.1 to 30.9 +/- 3.8 ng/L (p less than 0.01) after linoleic acid, probably because of acid suppression. The mean output of prostaglandin E increased from 498 +/- 110 to 1254 +/- 465 ng/h (p less than 0.05); that of its metabolite increased from 165 +/- 18 to 1168 +/- 645 ng/h (p less than 0.01).

After prostaglandin inhibitor treatment with indomethacin (10(-6) M), the dose-response curve to norepinephrine was reduced, and the dose (10(-10) M) of PGF2 alpha, which was ineffective in control tissues, facilitated the norepinephrine contractile response. In contrast, indomethacin did not change either the contractile response induced by potassium or the PGF2 alpha potentiation of this response. Calcium antagonists diltiazem or flunarizine reduced the potassium-induced contractile response. After diltiazem treatment, 10(-10) M of PGF2 alpha was also effective in facilitating this response. The PGF2 alpha postjunctional effect was conserved after phosphoinositide hydrolysis inhibition. These results suggest that PGF2 alpha potentiation of the contractile response may be independent of PGF2 alpha contraction. Low doses of endogenous prostaglandins could be able to facilitate the norepinephrine contractile response in this tissue. This process may be independent of calcium influx and phosphoinositide hydrolysis.\r"

Additional frequent findings in this group were an increased cellularity, nuclear-cytoplasmic dissociation of maturation, eosinophilia, and macrophages that contained ingested nuclei. Similar changes were found in far fewer patients without increased marrow mast cells. Only one patient with massive cutaneous mastocytosis had mast cells with relatively large nuclei and immature granules in the extensively involved marrow. Repeated biopsies in this and in six other patients over 3 years showed no worsening of the marrow findings, and the clinical course of all patients was stable over up to 10 years of follow-up. The variable findings in the patients suggest that mastocytosis with cutaneous involvement is a heterogeneous disease where diverse stimuli may cause an increase of mast cells. The clinical course is, however, relatively stable.\r"

One of the mechanisms by which tumor cells can escape attack is by failing to express significant levels of idiotypic immunoglobulin at the cell surface, and a stable variant of this phenotype has been isolated. The variant, termed SNAG 1, continues to synthesize idiotypic IgM, which can be detected in the cytoplasm, but it neither secretes nor expresses IgM on the cell surface (less than 10% of the levels of the original BCL tumor), even though the H and L chains show no gross structural changes. The SNAG 1 cells resemble the parent BCL cells in morphology, in expression of MHC class I and II Ag and in bearing FcR. A significant difference between the BCL lymphoma cells and the variant cells is that the latter fail to respond to LPS by either DNA synthesis or secretion of IgM, suggesting that surface Ig might be required for such a response. The variant has a slower rate of division than the parent tumor both in vitro and in vivo, and a rather different organ distribution. Study of such variants might allow analysis of the mechanisms involved in surface Ig expression and its possible role in tumor cell growth and migration.\r"

SDS-PAGE revealed that molecules of Mr of 41 to 43 kDa and 56 to 58 kDa were associated with the affinity-purified I-Ak Ag from the AKR B cell lymphoma AKTB-1b. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (IEF vs SDS-PAGE) allowed further characterization of four molecules in the 41- to 43-kDa range and two in the 56- to 58-kDa range. All co-purifying proteins had isoelectric points between 5.2 and 6.2. The specificity of the association of the co-purifying molecules with the I-Ak Ag was established by using two criteria. First, with the exception of actin, proteins co-purifying with the I-Ak molecule were not found in samples of affinity-purified class I (H-2Kk) Ag or membrane Ig from the AKTB-1b lymphoma. Second, the use of the amino group-reactive homobifunctional cross-linker 3,3'-dithiobisproprionimidate with crude membranes from AKTB-1b increased the relative amount of materials co-purifying with I-Ak. The use of the membrane-impermeant cross-linker 3,3'-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl) proprionate provided evidence that the interaction between I-Ak and one or more of the co-purifying components occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Two of the co-purifying molecules have been identified. The major material in the 41- to 43-kDa range was partially sequenced, leading to its identification as cytoplasmic actin. One of the components in the 56- to 58-kDa range was tentatively identified as one of the isozymes (RII) of the regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, based on the use of the photoaffinity label 8-azido-cAMP.\r"

The purpose of this study was to correlate the histological and functional recovery of APC activity in the skin of C3H mice exposed to low-dose (4 X 450 J/m2) or high-dose (1 X 15 kJ/m2) UVR with the normalization of CH responsiveness. Skin biopsy specimens taken at various intervals after UVR exposure revealed a rapid recovery in the density of ATPase/Ia positive cells: about 70% of normal by 3 days, and normal after 5 days. Functional analyses showed that lymph node cells obtained from donors that were sensitized with DNFB 3 days after UVR treatment transferred normal ear-swelling responsiveness to non-primed recipients, thus indicating that APC activity in UVR-exposed skin paralleled the recovery of ATPase/Ia-positive epidermal cells. This suggested that an alternative mechanism causes the persistent depression of CH in mice exposed to UVR. Mice pretreated with indomethacin prior to UVR exposure demonstrated a capacity to elicit CH responses to DNFB, which paralleled the histological and functional recovery of APC in the skin (i.e., normal CH responses were elicited 3 days after exposure to UVR). We conclude from this study that APC activity in the skin recovers rapidly after exposure to UVR, and that a PG-dependent mechanism is responsible for many of the persistent and systemic effects that cause a depression in the CH responsiveness of mice treated with UVR.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in protein synthesis and phosphorylation in cultured human keratinocytes in response to TGF-beta have been examined by one and two dimensional electrophoresis. Transforming growth factor beta has been shown to cause little change in the rate of methionine incorporation in the concentration range in which growth is reversibly arrested. It does, however, prevent the labeling of certain specific bands detected on gels of triton-soluble proteins after 3 days of treatment. Phosphorylation of triton-soluble proteins is inhibited at concentrations of TGF-beta rather higher than the Kd of its receptor and may represent a nonphysiological effect. Nonetheless, the phosphorylation of certain prominent species is reduced. In keratinocytes cultured in delipidated serum, which show some expression of keratin 1 (67 kd) characteristic of normal maturation, TGF-beta reduces the incorporation of methionine into this keratin 1 and increases labeling of keratins 6 and 16. Transforming growth factor beta thus promotes regenerative maturation, which is normally expressed during wound healing. The ability of TGF-beta to arrest keratinocyte growth in a reversible manner and to stimulate regenerative maturation, supports its physiological role in controlling the balance between cell division, migration and maturation during epidermal wound healing.\r"

Substance P stimulated the synthesis of DNA of Pam 212 cells in the medium containing 2%-10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Stimulation of DNA synthesis was dose dependent if the cells were cultured in the medium containing 2% FCS (quiescent condition). This effect was inhibited by spantide. In a serum-free medium, substance P had no effect on keratinocyte proliferation. In contrast, substance K, which shares a common amino acid sequence with substance P on its C-terminal, did not affect DNA synthesis of Pam 212 cells in either medium condition. Substance P released in inflammation may stimulate epidermal proliferation.\r"

This study was carried out to investigate whether or not the gene controlling the susceptibility to psoriasis vulgaris existed on the HLA, especially the HLA-C region. At first, we analyzed the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of 13 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 6 healthy controls who were all positive for at least one allele of HLA-Cw6. To characterize RFLP in psoriasis patients who did not have HLA-Cw6, 12 patients and 10 healthy controls who had HLA-Cw7 were also examined. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA demonstrated that DNA polymorphisms of the HLA-C antigen gene could not be found in any psoriasis vulgaris patient whether HLA-Cw6 or Cw7. However, a 4.5 kb BamHI fragment and a 3.1 kb PstI fragment were lacking in some healthy controls who had either HLA-Cw6 or Cw7. This study suggests that the presence of RFLP in the HLA-C gene is associated with psoriasis vulgaris. These specific fragments may help predispose individuals to psoriasis vulgaris, or may be essential for the development of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between in vitro cell binding and in vivo tumor accumulation of radiolabeled antibodies was studied using 125I- and 111In-labeled monoclonal antibodies to human osteosarcoma, and a human osteosarcoma xenograft (KT005) in nude mice. Three monoclonal antibodies--OST6, OST7, and OST15--raised against human osteosarcoma recognize the same antigen molecule. Although the binding of both 125I- and 111In-labeled OST6 to KT005 cells was higher than that of radiolabeled OST7 in vitro, 125I-labeled OST6 showed a faster clearance from the circulation and a lower accumulation in the transplanted tumor than 125I-labeled OST7. In contrast to the radioiodinated antibodies, the in vivo tumor accumulation of 111In-labeled OST6 was higher, although not significantly, than that of 111In-labeled OST7. OST15 showed the lowest binding in vitro, and its in vivo tumor localization was also lower than the others. The discrepancy in tumor uptake between OST6 and OST7 labeled with either 125I or 111In may have been a result of differing blood clearance. These results suggest that binding studies can be used to exclude from in vivo use those antibodies which show very poor binding in vitro, while in vivo serum clearance may be a better test for choosing antibodies with similar binding.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of 16-methylene E2, a 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor, to enhance estradiol 17 beta (E2) potency was assayed by 24-hr weight gain in the immature rat uterus. Initial studies demonstrated that 16-methylene E2 (1-100 micrograms s.c.) did not produce significant uterine weight gain 24 hr after administration, whereas E2 (0.1-10 micrograms s.c.) produced a significant uterine weight gain under the same experimental conditions. A subthreshold dose of E2 (0.01 microgram s.c.) when administered in combination with 100 micrograms (s.c.) of 16-methylene E2 produced a significant uterine weight gain. When rats were predosed with 16-methylene E2 at 72, 48, 24, 6 or 0 hr before the administration of 0.01 microgram of E2, the magnitude of the 24-hr uterine weight gain increased and attained maximal values for the 6-hr pretreatment time point. A subsequent dose-response study of 16-methylene E2 (1-100 micrograms s.c.) administered 6 hr before 0.01 microgram of E2 revealed that the 10, 50 and 100 microgram 16-methylene E2 dose significantly increased uterine weight gain in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that 16-methylene E2 is not a direct acting estrogen but acts synergistically with E2 to produce an enhanced uterine response. In a separate set of monkey experiments: 1) A trace dose of [3H]E2 was perfused through the in situ, term rhesus monkey placenta via the umbilical arteries and samples were collected from the umbilical vein of this open system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the endothelium on smooth muscle tone and the response of the pig right coronary artery to norepinephrine (NE) was studied. Isolated rings of artery with and without endothelium were stretched in the presence of nitroprusside to a tension previously determined to be optimal for contraction. During wash out of the nitroprusside, rings without endothelium spontaneously generated tone representing 24% of the contraction caused by potassium (120 mM); in rings with endothelium no significant spontaneous tone was observed. Relaxations were caused by NE in rings with endothelium contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). In rings without endothelium, NE relaxed spontaneously generated tone as well as that produced by PGF2 alpha. Independent of the mode or degree of contraction, rings with endothelium were more sensitive to NE than rings without endothelium. The difference in sensitivity to NE between rings with and without endothelium was likely due to endothelial cell alpha-2 adrenoceptors, inasmuch as the difference was abolished by rauwolscine. In the presence of propranolol and prazosin, endothelium-dependent relaxations were observed which were also inhibited by rauwolscine. Nevertheless, beta adrenoceptors are the predominant mediator of the relaxation to NE of pig coronary smooth muscle, because propranolol caused a greater shift to the right of the relaxation induced by NE compared to that caused by endothelium removal. Accordingly, under resting conditions, NE caused contractions only in the presence of propranolol. These contractions were attenuated by prazosin or rauwolscine, but blocked only by a combination of both alpha adrenoceptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty studies that evaluated gonadal function after cyclophosphamide therapy for renal disease or combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease or acute lymphocytic leukemia provided data for analysis. Data were stratified according to sex, illness, chemotherapeutic regimen and dose, and pubertal stage at the time of treatment. Chemotherapy-induced damage was more likely to occur in patients who were treated when sexually mature compared with those who were treated when prepubertal. Males were significantly more frequently affected than females when treated for renal disease or Hodgkin's disease. Chemotherapy-induced damage was also more likely to occur when patients were treated with large doses of alkylating agents. These data suggest that chemotherapy-induced damage is proportional to gonadal activity. Further efforts are needed to test whether induced gonadal quiescence during chemotherapy will reduce the strikingly high incidence of gonadal failure following chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GRE) are often tightly clustered with other transcription factor binding sequences. Examples of this occur upstream of the genes for chicken lysozyme and human metallothionein IIA (ref. 3), in several retroviral LTRs and upstream of the rat tryptophan oxygenase (TO) gene. In the TO gene, sequences immediately upstream of a glucocorticoid receptor binding site are required for steroid induction and contain a CACCC-box identical to that found in the beta globin gene. Here we demonstrate specific binding to this TO-CACCC element and show that it will also act cooperatively with a MMTV glucocorticoid receptor binding site. The response to dexamethasone is independent of the order and relative orientation of these elements but does depend on their precise spacing. Optimal induction occurs at a periodicity of approximately 10 base pairs (bp) indicating a requirement for stereospecific alignment. Binding to the CACCC box, however, is not affected by its distance from the glucocorticoid receptor site. We conclude that the observed cooperativity is mediated by protein:protein interactions and does not depend on cooperative DNA binding.\r"

Twenty patients had obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but only three had an impairing, diagnosable disorder. Fifty-six percent had a positive family history for TS or tics. Eighteen needed pharmacotherapy, although, for most, TS was a mild disorder requiring no drug treatment.\r"

Usually this involves the synthesis of mixtures of oligonucleotides complementary to all possible bases in degenerate positions of codons. As an alternative we have prepared and characterized a series of unique oligonucleotides containing a pyrimidine analog, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (F). Thermodynamic parameters and the melting temperatures of hybrid duplexes containing A.F and G.F base pairs showed that they are considerably more stable than duplexes containing A.T and G.T base pairs. The stability of a duplex decreased linearly with the number of mismatches introduced at positions at least a codon apart. A 5-fluorodeoxyuridine-substituted oligonucleotide cDNA detects rat liver pyruvate carboxylase mRNA on a RNA gel blot with a dissociation temperature only 10 degrees C below the measured melting temperature in solution. We suggest that the complexity of oligonucleotide cDNAs used for screening gene libraries can be reduced by the design of single hybridization probes containing the substituted bases--5-fluorodeoxyuridine to pair with adenosine or guanosine, guanosine to pair with cytidine or thymidine, and deoxyinosine to pair with adenosine or cytidine at positions of codon degeneracy--and still retain near-maximum stability of hybrid duplexes.\r"

The activator is a heat-stable protein having an apparent molecular mass of approximately equal to 40 kDa. It appears to be associated with the cytoskeletal fraction of human neutrophils. Neutrophils also contain an endogenous cytosolic calpain inhibitor (calpastatin), which is readily separated from the activator by size-exclusion chromatography. The effects of the activator and inhibitor appear to be antagonistic and may constitute a physiological mechanism for modulating intracellular calpain activity.\r"

DNase and exonuclease III cleavage-protection analysis reveals that a promoter binding activity located at -60 base pairs from the transcription start site is substantially reduced in transformed thyroid cells. The repression in the transformed cells of the reporter gene joined to the thyroglobulin promoter can be reversed by fusion with normal differentiated thyroid cells. Fusion of transformed thyroid cells to liver cells does not reactivate the reporter under control of the thyroglobulin promoter.\r"

In mammals or mammalian cells treated with carcinogenic alkylating agents, loss of these derivatives has been demonstrated repeatedly. Nevertheless, mammalian repair proteins that are analogous to those from E. coli do not detectably act on these alkyl derivatives. A variety of techniques has been used by many investigators in the United States and Europe, who conclude here that the mode of O-alkylpyrimidine and alkyl phosphotriester repair in mammalian cells differs from that in E. coli. New approaches and methods are needed to characterize these processes at the biochemical and molecular level.\r"

  ".W": "Chemically synthesized duplex oligodeoxynucleotides having different average numbers of adenine tracts (A6) per helix turn were ligated into multimers and analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The magnitude of the anomaly in gel mobility is found to be a quadratic function of the curvature of the DNA molecule. Parameters that describe intrinsic DNA bending, expressed as the tilt and roll components of the helix-axis deflection at the junctions between the adenine tract and adjacent B-DNA, were adjusted to fit the measured relative curvature of regularly repeated DNA bending sequences known from other studies and synthesized for this study. The model developed here retains the predominance of bending in the direction of tilt at the junctions but incorporates an appreciable roll component at the 5' end of an adenine tract, opening the minor groove there. This feature is consistent with chemical \"footprinting\" experiments on molecules containing adenine tracts. The overall direction of bending is effectively toward the minor groove, viewed from the center of an A5 or A6 tract. A possible underlying structure, which can also be described by a wedge bending model, is that derived from fiber diffraction studies of poly(dA).poly(dT). However, alternative models for the adenine tract, such as propeller twisted DNA, cannot be eliminated, although they do not lead to the correct direction of bending. The results permit calculation of the helix-axis trajectory of natural DNA molecules containing adenine-tract bends.\r"

  ".U": "88158075\r", 
  ".W": "Human apolipoprotein B (apoB) is present in plasma as two separate isoproteins, designated apoB-100 (512 kDa) and apoB-48 (250 kDa). ApoB is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 2, and a single nuclear mRNA is edited and processed into two separate apoB mRNAs. A 14.1-kilobase apoB mRNA codes for apoB-100, and the second mRNA, which codes for apoB-48, contains a premature stop codon generated by a single base substitution of cytosine to uracil at nucleotide 6538, which converts the translated CAA codon coding for the amino acid glutamine at residue 2153 in apoB-100 to a premature in-frame stop codon (UAA). Two 30-base synthetic oligonucleotides (nucleotides 6523-6552 of apoB mRNA), designated apoB-Stop and apoB-Gln, were synthesized containing the complementary sequence to the stop codon (UAA) and glutamine codon (CAA), respectively. Analysis of intestinal apoB mRNA by hybridization with apoB-Stop and apoB-Gln probes and sequence analysis of apoB clones in two independent human small intestinal cDNA libraries established that intestinal apoB mRNA contained both the apoB mRNA that codes for apoB-100 and the apoB mRNA containing the premature in-frame stop codon, which codes for apoB-48. Investigation of hepatic apoB mRNA and two hepatic cDNA libraries by hybridization with the apoB-Stop and apoB-Gln synthetic probes as well as by cDNA sequencing revealed that liver apoB mRNA also contains both the apoB-100 mRNA and the apoB-48 mRNA containing the stop codon. The combined results from these studies establish that both human intestine and liver contain the two distinct apoB mRNAs, an mRNA that codes for apoB-100 and an apoB mRNA that contains the premature stop codon, which codes for apoB-48. The premature in-frame stop codon is not tissue specific and is present in both human liver and intestine.\r"

The activity of the transferrin receptor gene's promoter with the heterologous indicator gene was found to be approximately equal to 3-fold higher in cells treated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine than in cells treated with the iron source, hemin. A higher degree of iron regulation was seen in the expression of the human transferrin receptor cDNA driven by its own promoter. The receptor cDNA under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter was also iron-regulated. Several human transferrin receptor transcripts differing in their 3' end were produced in the murine cells regardless of the promoter used, with the shorter transcripts being relatively unregulated by iron. Deletion of cDNA corresponding to most of the 3' untranslated portion of the mRNA for the receptor ablated the iron regulation. We conclude that at least two genetic elements exist for the regulation of the transferrin receptor gene by iron. One has its locus in the DNA upstream of the transferrin receptor gene's transcription start site, and the other is dependent upon the integrity of the sequences in the 3' end of the gene.\r"

Levels of c-myc mRNA began to decrease in response to progesterone by 10 min after injection. The mRNA levels continued to decrease, reached a 70% reduction at 30 min, and returned to control values by 8 hr after steroid injection. Changes in alpha-tubulin mRNA levels were markedly less in these same RNA preparations. The effect was dependent on the dose of the steroid and was target-tissue specific. These changes occurred much more rapidly than changes in egg-white protein mRNA levels. Vehicle alone did not alter c-myc mRNA levels. Early regulated genes such as c-myc may represent the initial site of action of steroid receptors in the genome.\r"

We found that the regions of protection to nuclease afforded by the two proteins were distinct. p19 protected primarily the two tips in the RNA secondary structure. p68/72 protected a large region extending across the center of the particle and altered the nuclease pattern in the regions that p19 would bind, suggesting that these two proteins may be in close proximity in the particle. The protection afforded by the two proteins in combination was equal to the sum of the individual protections. We have not observed cooperativity in the binding of these two proteins as assessed by the protection assay; nor do we have any evidence that the structure becomes more compact as it assembles. The map derived from this \"footprint\" analysis places the signal recognition domain (p54 bound to the RNA via the 19-kDa protein) and the elongation arrest domain (associated with the Alu end of the particle) on opposite ends of the particle. Thus, it is possible that SRP recognizes signals by the direct interaction of p54 with the signal sequence at the nascent chain exit site and simultaneously blocks elongation by the entrance of p9/14 into the aminoacyl tRNA site 16 nm away.\r"

The results are analyzed in terms of solvent density distributions. The calculated minor-groove solvent density shows considerable localization, indicative of discrete solvation sites and providing theoretical evidence for a well-defined ordered water structure. In the AATT sequence, this corresponds to the \"spine of hydration\" described by H. R. Drew and R. E. Dickerson [(1981) J. Mol. Biol. 151, 535-556] based on the x-ray crystal structure of the dodecamer hydrate. We find, however, that the calculated ordered water structure also extends into the CGCG flanking sequences, supported by the N2 hydrogen bond donors of the guanine residues and indicating that the spine of hydration could thus extend throughout the minor groove of a B-form DNA. This provides a possible explanation of the positive binding entropies observed by L. A. Marky and K. J. Breslauer [(1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 4359-4363] for both A.T and C.G sequences on the complexation of netropsin to the minor groove of DNAs. Implications of these results with regard to the thermodynamic stability of DNA in water and the sequence specificity of the minor groove hydration are discussed.\r"

We found a time-dependent decrease in fluorescence intensity with the onset of the flow with an exponential approach to steady state of the order of 1 min. The process is reversible; when the flow is stopped the fluorescence intensity returns to its original value. The polarization of the endothelial cell membranes or, more precisely, the amplitude of the fluorescence intensity responses is an increasing function of the shear stress (up to 120 dynes/cm2). Assuming the equilibrium potential for K+ is more hyperpolarized than the resting potential and using valinomycin, we have deduced from the sign of the ionophore effects that the flow hyperpolarizes the endothelial cell membrane.\r"

Changes in [Ca2+]i that occurred in response to crosslinking of IgE receptors on the cell surface or to application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin were studied. Stimulation of RBL cells with antigen resulted in rapid increases in [Ca2+]i following lag times that varied widely from cell to cell. Simple averaging of the Ca2+ responses of many cells yielded a gradual response profile that closely resembled that of suspensions of cells measured in the fluorometer. The results show that single cells can respond much more rapidly to antigen than has previously been suggested by studies on populations of cells. The lag time between addition of antigen and initiation of the increase in [Ca2+]i varied considerably between cells in the same field of view. Both the rise time and the variability and average duration of the lag time increased with decreasing antigen concentration.\r"

We investigated the role of 1,2-diacylglycerol, one of the products of receptor-linked phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, in mediating the migratory response of leukocytes. In an under-agarose migration system, we found 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol to be a strong chemoattractant for human PMN, 6C3HED (a mouse thymic lymphoma), and Jurkat (a human T-cell leukemia). By using a modified Boyden chamber assay, the migratory response of PMN to 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol was determined to be primarily chemotactic. Analysis of structural analogs indicated that both the position and number of acyl chains are important in determining chemoattractant activity. These studies demonstrate that exogenous 1,2-diacylglycerol can stimulate the directed migration of leukocytes. They further suggest that the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol following receptor-mediated stimulation may represent a common step in the migratory responses of myeloid and lymphoid cells.\r"

We have prepared a biologically active [3H]1MeAde of high purity and relatively high specific radioactivity. This ligand binds to cortices isolated from full-grown prophase-arrested oocytes of the starfish Asterina pectinifera. The binding of [3H]1MeAde to cortices was rapid and reached equilibrium in approximately 15 min. This is in excellent agreement with the hormone-dependent period required for the induction of oocyte maturation. Binding was maximal between pH 6.4 and 8.0 and diminished sharply above and below this range. Analysis of Scatchard plots of the equilibrium binding of [3H]1MeAde to cortices indicates the existence of a single class of binding site with a dissociation constant of 0.3 microM and a binding capacity of 0.02 fmol per cortex. Whereas biologically active analogs (1-benzyladenine, 1-ethyladenine) inhibited the specific binding of [3H]1MeAde by cortices, biologically inactive analogs (2-methyladenine, 3-methyladenine, 1,9-dimethyladenine, and 1-methylhypoxanthine) did not. These results suggest that the 1MeAde binding characterized herein is necessary for the maturational action of 1MeAde on starfish oocytes.\r"

To enable the investigation of the molecular lesions in this disorder and to study the evolutionary relationship between the alpha and beta chains, the beta-chain gene was isolated, and its organization was characterized. The beta-chain coding region is divided into 14 exons distributed over approximately 40 kilobases of DNA. Comparison with the alpha-chain gene revealed that 12 of the 13 introns interrupt the coding regions at homologous positions.

In contrast, when mating preference is effectively determined by interaction between a cytoplasmic gene and the multilocus nuclear genotypes characteristic of the parental species, all cytonuclear disequilibria, as well as frequencies of pure parentals, rapidly decay to zero unless assortative mating is nearly perfect. Results of the models are applied to the interpretation of observed cytonuclear associations in a hybrid population of Hyla tree frogs.\r"

Clones were selected for the ability of secreted antibodies to react with liposomes containing 71% cholesterol but not with liposomes containing 43% cholesterol. The antibodies also reacted with crystalline cholesterol in a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Binding of monoclonal antibodies to the surface of crystalline cholesterol was demonstrated by electron microscopy by utilizing a second antibody (anti-IgM) labeled with colloidal gold. The immunization period required to induce monoclonal antibodies was very short (3 days) and a high fraction of the hybrid cells (at least 70%) were secreting detectable antibodies to cholesterol. The results demonstrate that cholesterol can be a highly immunogenic molecule and that complement-fixing antibodies to cholesterol can be readily obtained.\r"

Both human and rat cDNAs encode an NH2-terminal signal peptide, two immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains (encoded by discrete exons), a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a positively charged cytoplasmic tail. The human and rat alpha subunits share an overall homology with one another and the immunoglobulin gene family, suggesting that they arose from a common ancestral gene and continue to share structural homology with their ligands. In addition, the rat gene is transcribed into at least three distinct forms, each of which yields a somewhat different coding sequence.\r"

Purified C5b-9(m) complexes isolated from target membranes, whether in solution or bound to liposomes, inhibited lysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes by whole human serum in a dose-dependent manner. C9 was not required for the inhibitory function since C5b-7 and C5b-8 complexes isolated from membranes were also effective. No effect was found with the cytolytically inactive, fluid-phase SC5b-9 complex. However, tryptic modification of SC5b-9 conferred an inhibitory capacity to the complex, due probably to partial removal of the S protein. Experiments using purified components demonstrated that C5b-9(m) exerts a regulatory effect on the formation of the classical- and alternative-pathway C3 convertases and on the utilization of C5 by cell-bound C5 convertases. C5b-9(m) complexes were unable to inhibit the lysis of cells bearing C5b-7(m) by C8 and C9. Addition of C5b-9(m) to whole human serum abolished its bactericidal effect on the serum-sensitive Escherichia coli K-12 strain W 3110 and suppressed its hemolytic function on antibody-sensitized, autologous erythrocytes. Feedback inhibition by C5b-9(m) represents a biologically relevant mechanism through which complement may autoregulate its effector functions.\r"

Goat anti-SP-10-IIIB serum bound to the surface of HTLV-IIIB-infected CEM T cells but not to the surface of HTLV-IIIRF-infected or uninfected CEM T cells. Anti-SP-10-IIIB antibodies also selectively bound to gp120 from lysates of HTLV-IIIB cells in immunoblot assays. Twenty-one percent of sera (28 of 175) from patients seropositive for HIV contained antibodies that reacted with SP-10-IIIB in RIA. Human anti-SP-10-IIIB antibodies affinity purified from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient serum bound to HTLV-IIIB-infected cells and immunoprecipitated gp120. Goat antibodies to SP-10-IIIB neutralized HTLV-IIIB (80% neutralization titer of 1/600), inhibited HTLV-IIIB-induced syncytium formation, but did not neutralize HIV isolates HTLV-IIIRF or HTLV-IIIMN or inhibit syncytium formation with these isolates. Also, goat antiserum to an homologous synthetic peptide [SP-10-IIIRF(A), (Cys)-Arg-Lys-Ser-Ile-Thr-Lys-Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg-Val-Ile-Tyr] from gp120 of HIV isolate HTLV-IIIRF inhibited syncytium formation by HTLV-IIIRF, but did not inhibit syncytium formation by HTLV-IIIB or by HTLV-IIIMN. Thus, the amino acid sequences of SP-10-IIIB and SP-10-IIIRF(A) define homologous regions of gp120 that are important in type-specific virus neutralization. The identification of these type-specific neutralizing epitopes should facilitate the design of a polyvalent, synthetic vaccine for AIDS.\r"

Human placental poly(A)+ RNA was probed with either the 5'-UTR of the isolated human placental IGF-II cDNA or the 5'-UTR of the IGF-II cDNA obtained from adult human liver. No transcripts were detected by using the 5'-UTR of the adult liver IGF-II as the probe. In contrast, three transcripts of 6.0, 3.2, and 2.2 kilobases were detected by using the 5'-UTR of the placental IGF-II cDNA as the probe or the probe from the coding sequence. A fourth IGF-II transcript of 4.9 kilobases presumably containing a 5'-UTR consisting of a base sequence dissimilar to that of either IGF-II 5'-UTR was apparent. Therefore, IGF-II transcripts detected may be products of alternative splicing as their 5'-UTR sequence is contained within the human IGF-II gene or they may be a consequence of alternative promoter utilization in placenta.\r"

The binding characteristics of these peptides were investigated on brain cortex membranes and pancreatic acini of guinea pig. Compounds I and II were competitive inhibitors of [3H]Boc[Ahx28,31]CCK-(27-33) binding to central CCK receptors and showed a high degree of selectivity for these binding sites (compound I: Ki for pancreas/Ki for brain, 179; compound II: Ki for pancreas/Ki for brain, 1979). This high selectivity was associated with a high affinity for central CCK receptors (compound I: Ki, 5.1 nM; compound II: Ki, 0.49 nM). Similar affinities and selectivities were found when 125I Bolton-Hunter-labeled CCK-8 was used as a ligand. Moreover, these compounds were only weakly active in the stimulation of amylase release from guinea pig pancreatic acini (EC50 greater than 10,000 nM) and were unable to induce contractions in the guinea pig ileum (to 10(-6) M). The two cyclic CCK analogues, therefore, appear to be synthetic ligands exhibiting both high affinity and high selectivity for central CCK binding sites. These compounds could help clarify the respective role of central and peripheral receptors for various CCK-8-induced pharmacological effects.\r"

In particular, we have analyzed a network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells, both of which may receive information from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then interact through cortico-cortical synapses in a mean-field approximation. Our investigation of the evolution of a cell in this mean-field network indicates that many of the results on existence and stability of fixed points that have been obtained previously in the single-cell theory can be successfully generalized here. We can, in addition, make explicit further statements concerning the independent effects of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on selectivity and ocular dominance. For example, shutting off inhibitory cells lessens selectivity and alters ocular dominance (masked synapses). These inhibitory cells may be selective, but there is no theoretical necessity that they be so. Further, the intercortical inhibitory synapses do not have to be very responsive to visual experience. Most of the learning process can occur among the excitatory LGN-cortical synapses.\r"

Using nuclease-protection assays, we have found that ARIA causes a 2- to 16-fold increase in the level of mRNA encoding the alpha subunit of the receptor, with little or no change in the levels of gamma- and delta-subunit messengers. ARIA also increases the amount of a putative nuclear precursor of alpha-subunit mRNA, consistent with an activation of gene transcription. These results suggest that the concentration of alpha subunit may limit the rate of biosynthesis of the acetylcholine receptors in chicken myotubes. They also indicate that neuronal factors can regulate the expression of receptor subunit genes in a selective manner. Tetrodotoxin, 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin also increase the amount of alpha-subunit mRNA, with little change in the amount of gamma- and delta-subunit mRNAs. Unlike, ARIA, however, these agents have little effect on the concentration of the alpha-subunit nuclear precursor.\r"

PKC was partially purified from the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from naive, pseudoconditioned, and conditioned rabbits 24 hr after the rabbits were well conditioned. Crude membrane and cytosol fractions were prepared. In conditioned rabbits, significantly more PKC activity (63.3%) was associated with the membrane fraction (and significantly less with the cytosol fraction) compared to naive (42.0%) and pseudoconditioned (44.7%) animals. These differences in distribution of enzyme activity were paralleled by differences in stimulation of enzyme activity by Ca2+, phospholipid, and diacylglycerol. There were no between-group differences in basal protein kinase activity. These results suggest that there is a long-term translocation of PKC from cytosol to membrane as a result of conditioning. Autoradiographic binding of radioactive phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to PKC demonstrated that almost all specific binding was in the stratum radiatum, a region containing the proximal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Therefore, this may be the site of the conditioning-specific PKC translocation, a locus well-suited to underlie the biophysical effects of conditioning.\r"

This gene was used to isolate a cDNA from a Drosophila adult head cDNA library. The cDNA was defined by sequence analysis to encode 13 peptides that have Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 or related sequences at their carboxyl termini. Other putative neuropeptides, including one that has homology to mammalian corticotropin-releasing factor, are present in the deduced approximately equal to 39-kDa precursor. Southern blot analysis suggested the presence of a single Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2-like gene within the haploid genome. RNA blot analysis indicated the expression of at least two transcripts of approximately equal to 1.7 and approximately equal to 0.7 kilobases. Both transcripts are evident throughout larval, pupal, and adult developmental stages. In situ hybridization was used to localize this neuropeptide gene to band 46C on the right arm of the 2nd chromosome. These data provide the basis for utilizing the advanced genetics and molecular techniques of Drosophila to address complex aspects of neuropeptide expression and function.\r"

Studies with 95 of those mAbs that recognized the peptides before and after chemical phosphorylation demonstrated that a highly immunogenic epitope shared by the peptides is present in NFs from all species tested, including invertebrates. This suggests the phylogenetic conservation of a major NF phosphorylation site.

Repeated testing from an electrode placed chronically in the motor cortex showed a shift from vibrissa to forelimb within hours after facial nerve transection.

The whole-cell voltage clamp technique was used to measure the membrane current, and 0.9 mM fura-2 was loaded into the cell by including it in the dialyzing solution of the patch electrode. A mechanical light chopper operating at 1200 Hz was used to obtain simultaneous measurements of the intracellular Ca2+ activity with fluorescence excitation on either side of the isosbestic point (330 nm and 410 nm). The symmetry of the two optical Ca2+ signals was used as a criterion to guard against artifacts resulting, for instance, from motion. The voltage dependence of peak Ca2+ current and the Ca2+ transient measured 25 ms after depolarizing clamps from a holding potential of -40 mV were bell-shaped and virtually identical. The Ca2+ entry estimated from the integral of the Ca2+ current (0 mV, 25 ms) corresponds to a 5-10 microM increase in the total intracellular Ca2+ concentration, whereas the optical signal indicated a 100 microM increase in total intracellular Ca2+. Repolarization of clamp pulses from highly positive potentials were accompanied by a second Ca2+ transient, the magnitude of which, when summed with that measured during depolarization, was nearly constant. Ryanodine (10 microM) had little or no effect on the peak Ca2+ current but reduced the magnitude of the early Ca2+ transients by 70-90%. Epinephrine (1 microM) increased the Ca2+ current and the Ca2+ transients, accelerated the rate of decline of the Ca2+ transients at potentials between -30 and +70 mV, and reduced the intracellular [Ca2+] below baseline at potentials positive to +80 or negative to -40 mV, where clamp pulses did not elicit any Ca2+ release. Elevation of intracellular cAMP mimicked the relaxant effect of epinephrine at depolarizing potentials, whereas elevation of extracellular [Ca2+] did not. These results suggest that most of the activator Ca2+ in rat ventricular cells is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a graded response to sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx. Consistent with a graded Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release we find that epinephrine increases the internal Ca2+ release by increasing the Ca2+ current. Epinephrine may also increase the Ca2+ content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum that may, in turn, increase the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The relaxant effect of epinephrine appears to be caused by enhanced rate of Ca2+ resequestration and is mediated by adenylate cyclase system.\r"

  ".W": "Recently we isolated a protein growth factor of 34 kDa from trophoblastic membranes of human placenta. A fraction (approximately equal to 50%) of the membrane-associated 34-kDa protein is peripherally associated--i.e., it can be released by high salt treatment. The remainder shows the characteristics of an integral membrane protein--i.e., its release requires detergent treatment. Here we report studies on the structural basis for membrane anchorage of the protein. Phospholipase C was found to release an immunoreactive 34-kDa polypeptide from intact isolated cytotrophoblasts. Studies with isolated trophoblastic membranes showed that phospholipase C specifically released the salt-resistant fraction of the 34-kDa polypeptide. The polypeptide released by phospholipase C showed the same electrophoretic mobility in NaDodSO4/PAGE as the polypeptide prior to phospholipase C treatment. The identity of the released protein with the 34-kDa growth factor has been established by both immunologic and receptor-binding assays. Other studies show that there is biosynthetic incorporation of [3H]myristate into the 34-kDa protein. The myristate label is labile to phospholipase C treatment. These results suggest that some of the 34-kDa protein is anchored to the plasma membrane via a posttranslationally added phospholipid. This mode of anchorage has been observed for some other membrane proteins and raises interesting questions regarding the role of this novel linkage in the mitogenic function of the 34-kDa polypeptide.\r"

This multidrug resistance (MDR) is believed to be a major problem in cancer therapy. Organic Ca2+-channel blockers, such as verapamil, can reverse this resistance and render MDR cells in culture nearly as sensitive to the antineoplastic drugs as the drug-sensitive cells from which they were derived. It has therefore been suggested that Ca2+ channels may play a role in MDR. To determine directly whether there are electrophysiological correlates of MDR, we used whole-cell and single-channel patch-clamp techniques to survey the ion channels in a drug-sensitive human T-cell leukemia line, CCRF-CEM, and a MDR variant, CEM/VLB100. We found no evidence for a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel. However, we did identify three other current/channel types: a voltage-gated tetrodotoxin-sensitive inward current carried by Na+, a voltage-gated labile outward current carried by K+, and a nonselective cation channel reversing at 0 mV. Drug-sensitive and -resistant cells were the same with respect to the level of expression of these channels.\r"

There was no significant difference between radionuclide studies and MR images in the detection of osteomyelitis, but MR imaging was significantly more sensitive (100% vs. 69%; P less than .01) in the detection of soft-tissue infection. In addition, cellulitis could not be distinguished from soft-tissue abscess on radionuclide studies, whereas MR imaging was 92% accurate in depicting soft-tissue abscesses. Further research is necessary to determine how to relate these findings to true human clinical situations.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of five quinolones into inflammatory exudate were studied in healthy volunteers. The compounds studied were norfloxacin (400 mg orally), enoxacin (400 mg intravenously and 600 mg orally), ciprofloxacin (100 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally), ofloxacin (600 mg orally), and pefloxacin (400 mg intravenous). Orally administered ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most rapidly absorbed (time to maximal serum level, 1.2 hours) and enoxacin the least (1.9 hours). The serum levels attained were highest in the case of ofloxacin (after an allowance was made for the higher dose administered). The serum elimination half-lives were as follows: norfloxacin, 3.75 hours; ciprofloxacin, 3.9 hours (oral) and 4.0 hours (intravenous); ofloxacin, 7.0 hours; enoxacin, 6.2 hours (oral) and 5.1 hours (intravenous); and pefloxacin, 10.5 hours. All agents penetrated well into a mild inflammatory exudate. The 24-hour recovery rate from urine was 62% for oral enoxacin, 46.4% for intravenous enoxacin (plus 12.2% for oxo-enoxacin), 27% for norfloxacin, 30.6% for oral ciprofloxacin, 75.7% for intravenous ciprofloxacin, 73% for ofloxacin, and 4.9% for pefloxacin (plus 9.2% for the norfloxacin metabolite and 17.8% for pefloxacin N-oxide). A dosing schedule for the quinolones was proposed on the basis of pharmacokinetic parameters and microbiologic activity.\r"

After 18 months he relapsed in a leukemic phase with hematuria due to thrombocytopenia. While receiving 10 units of random donor platelets, he had anaphylaxis, for which he received epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg), causing rapid tumor lysis with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and a rise in creatinine. Treatment with allopurinol and high-volume alkaline diuresis led to recovery of normal renal function within 72 hours. Since steroids are cytotoxic to many leukemias and lymphomas, physicians prescribing transfusions or treating anaphylaxis in cancer patients should be aware of this life-threatening potential complication.\r"

Fifteen new linkages are established, and new data are added to the four previously reported linkages on 4q. Tight linkage of interleukin 2 (T-cell growth factor), epidermal growth factor, and alcohol dehydrogenase is described. Significant differences were observed between male and female recombination rates. The female rate was estimated to be 1.27 times the male rate. On the basis of these pairwise results, the order for the 11 loci is D4S35-GC-(ALB/AFP)-MT2P1-D4S1-INP10-ADH3-( EGF/IL2)-(FBB/FBA/FBG)-MNS.

The two forms of gelsolin are encoded by a single gene and derived through alternative message splicing. By Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ chromosomal localization, we demonstrate that the gelsolin gene is present on human chromosome 9 in bands q32-q34. In situ hybridization of gelsolin to cells containing a Philadelphia chromosome [(9;22)(q34;q11)], as well as Southern blot analysis of K562 cell DNA, indicates that gelsolin is centromeric to the ABL locus in 9q34. Southern blot analysis of NotI-digested, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-separated DNA indicates the gelsolin gene is greater than or equal to 40 kb centromeric to ABL. These studies and standard Southern blot analysis of digested DNA also indicate that the NotI restriction site contained in the gelsolin gene is uncleavable in DNA from white blood cells and hematopoietic cell lines.\r"

  ".W": "Serine proteases such as plasminogen activators are produced by granulosa cells both in vivo and in vitro and have been implicated in the process of ovulation. For a study of potential roles of serine proteases in early follicular development, immature rats were injected with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, followed 2 hours later by laparotomy and injection of the serine protease inhibitors benzamidine and epsilon-aminocaproic acid into the bursa of one ovary. As a control, saline solution was injected into the contralateral bursa. Animals were put to death 48 hours after injection of serine protease inhibitors, and three to five randomly selected longitudinal sections were evaluated by computerized morphometry. The area occupied by antral follicles relative to the total cross-sectional area of each section was computed. Resultant ratios from serine protease inhibitor-treated ovaries were compared with those from contralateral control ovaries. Ninety-three percent of serine protease inhibitor-treated ovaries showed a reduction in antral follicular size when compared with corresponding control ovaries, which is indicative of inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitor treatment on folliculogenesis. To further investigate this effect, ovulation was induced by human chorionic gonadotropin administration 48 hours after pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and 46 hours after serine protease inhibitor or saline solution treatment. Animals were put to death 20 hours later and the number of oocytes ovulated into oviducts was determined. Oviducts from serine protease inhibitor-treated ovaries contained 51% fewer oocytes than their control counterparts. Artifacts of surgical stress or vascular diffusion of serine protease inhibitor from treated to control sides were ruled out by appropriate control experiments. We conclude that early serine protease inhibitor treatment of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin-stimulated rat ovaries impairs folliculogenesis. Thus, in addition to involvement in ovulation, serine proteases appear to play important roles throughout follicular development.\r"
