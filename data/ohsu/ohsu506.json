  ".W": "Concern regarding an occupational risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may influence surgeons' willingness to operate. A questionnaire survey of all orthopedists in the five cities with the most cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was conducted to assess attitudes and practices. Questionnaires were completed anonymously by 325 of 510 orthopedists. In the previous year, 43 percent had examined or operated on an HIV-infected patient, and at least 90 percent who had had an opportunity to operate on an HIV-infected patient had chosen to do so. Decisions to operate did not appear to be based on hospital requirements, perceived ethical obligations, or knowledge of HIV transmissibility. Most orthopedists (85 percent) claimed the right to order preoperative HIV testing of high-risk patients, but such testing was ordered infrequently. Although most orthopedists believed they could not be compelled to operate and that ethically they could refuse when their health was threatened, they almost always were willing to treat HIV-infected patients.\r"

Most respondents reacted positively; 86 percent believed that it was a good use of government money, and only 7 percent would have preferred not getting it. Analysis by demographic characteristics indicated that blacks and young people were less likely to remember receiving the brochure than were whites and retired persons. The public health community can assume that the mailing met with resounding approval and that other public health brochures would be welcomed.\r"

  ".W": "Five years ago, a task force on reducing risk for heart disease and stroke was established by the six New England States. The task force included representatives from State public health departments, academia, the corporate sector, and voluntary organizations. This article is the final report of the task force. Heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are major causes of mortality in the New England region. Heart disease causes nearly 40 percent of all deaths in each of the six States and cerebrovascular disease, 7 percent of the deaths. Major risk factors for ischemic heart disease that have been identified--elevated serum cholesterol, high blood pressure, and cigarette smoking--are caused largely by lifestyle behaviors. Similarly, cerebrovascular disease results largely from uncontrolled high blood pressure, much of which is attributable to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. In a series of studies evidence has accumulated that the reduction or elimination of these risk factors results in a decline in mortality rates. Many intervention programs have been mounted in the region, but there has been no population-wide effort to attack these risk factors. The task force proposed a broad range of activities for New Englanders at sites in the community and in health facilities. These activities would promote not smoking, exercising regularly, and maintaining desirable levels of serum cholesterol and blood pressure.\r"

  ".U": "89202624\r", 
  ".W": "From 1975 to 1988, nearly 900,000 Indochinese refugees were resettled in the United States. This paper examines patterns of fertility among these refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam who have exhibited high levels of reproduction since their arrival. Data are drawn from sample surveys in San Diego and San Francisco, CA. Fertility levels were found to exceed five children per ever-married woman, a level that is consistent with perceptions of ideal family size in the homeland. Fertility levels were significantly higher among rural second-wave refugees than in the more urban first-wave groups. One explanation for the high fertility is that couples have migrated from areas where fertility is high, and they have not yet adapted their reproductive behavior to the low fertility environment of the United States. This possibility is reinforced by a general gender preference for boys and exacerbated by the fact that, while a majority of women are aware of methods of fertility control, access is still limited by cultural and financial barriers, and the motivation to use family planning still appears to be relatively low. The data suggest that this refugee population will continue to put pressure on maternal and child health resources, and that continued residence in the United States could lead to desires to limit family size, thus increasing demand for methods of fertility control.\r"

Among 3,681 women treated with INH during and after pregnancy to prevent tuberculosis (TB), 5 developed INH hepatitis, and 2 of the 5 women died. Comparison with previously collected Public Health Service data concerning 3,948 nonpregnant women, using the Cox proportional hazards model, revealed a 2.5-fold increased risk of INH hepatitis in the prenatal clinic group. The mortality rate was four times higher in the prenatal clinic group. However, statistical power was low because of the small number of cases, and neither of these findings was statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). In the absence of controlled studies, the issue of INH safety during the perinatal period remains unresolved. Nevertheless, current American Thoracic Society-Centers for Disease Control recommendations regarding TB screening, implementation of INH chemoprophylaxis programs, and adequate monitoring of individuals on INH should be adhered to. The results of this investigation raise concern that deviations from existing policy may contribute to unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\r"

  ".W": "In an investigation of the health effects of a Christmas eve snowstorm in 1982, a review of emergency room records in the Denver area identified a cluster of 17 cases of finger amputations. Fifteen (88) percent of these amputations were associated with snowblower use. An additional 12 persons with hand or finger injuries without amputations from snowblowers were identified. A case-control study was performed comparing these patients with a control group who had used snowblowers. Patients were more likely than controls to have had their machines become clogged with snow (odds ratio [OR], 3.4, 95 percent confidence limits [CL], 0.74-15.4). Using a hand to dislodge trapped snow was the only risk factor identified for the patients (OR, 116; 95 percent CL, 16-820). No differences were found for other variables such as type of snowblower, instruction for use, or previous experience using a snowblower. The findings suggest that the most feasible measure to prevent such injuries is a change in snowblower design to preclude entry of a hand while the machine is running. This investigation illustrates the importance of surveillance in detecting and controlling injuries. Without such surveillance, the similarity among injuries reported on this paper would not have been recognized. Ongoing surveillance for injuries might identify other clusters of injuries.\r"

The analysis indicated a high cost burden for families in all disease categories studied, although a lack of uniformity in data presentation and in the variables studied prevented specific generalizations to be made about the numbers or characteristics of families with high costs.

Thirty-six percent of students surveyed met the case definition of gastroenteritis, as did 24 percent of school employees. Eating lunch in the cafeteria on January 30 was significantly associated with illness. After controlling for other food items consumed during the January 30 lunch, only the sandwiches were significantly associated with illness, but the source of the contamination was not identified. Four of 17 serum pairs from sick students and none of the 8 serum pairs from exposed controls (a nonsignificant difference) showed at least a 4-fold rise in antibody titre to Norwalk virus between acute- and convalescent-phase specimens. This outbreak of AING is believed to be the first to implicate epidemiologically sandwiches as vehicles of transmission. The outbreak highlights the need for investigators to look for a viral etiology in gastroenteritis outbreaks.\r"

The survey identified 224 State health department epidemiologists (estimated U.S. ratio 1.1 per million population). A State health department epidemiologist was most often male (80 percent), frequently (57 percent) was a physician, had an average age of 41 years, and had worked as an epidemiologist for 9 years. Participation in public health programs (either by supervising or providing consultation) by the State Epidemiologists and their staffs focused mainly on general epidemiology and communicable disease programs; fewer than half had participated in programs relating to the health of women and children, chronic diseases, injuries, or in other programs directed towards preventing premature mortality. Recently, the State Epidemiologists have been trying to broaden their activities into these areas; however, the demands created by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) will mostly likely slow this process. Based on the overall findings and collective experience, it was concluded that State health departments have too few epidemiologists to address the wide variety of important public health problems facing our communities. It was proposed that each State health department have at least four epidemiologists (including one or more physician epidemiologists) and at least one master's level biostatistician and that the epidemiologists-per-population ratio not be less than 1 per million.\r"

Data were collected on (a) socioeconomic differentials in mortality, (b) prevention of premature death by inquiring into the association of risk factors and cause of death, (c) health care services provided in the last year of life, and (d) the reliability of certain items reported on the death certificate. In addition to demographic characteristics of the decedent available from the death certificate and the questionnaire, information was secured on cigarette smoking practices, alcohol use, food consumption patterns, use of hospital, nursing home, and hospice care, sources of payment for care, duration of disability, and assistance with activities of daily living. A rich body of data was collected for analysis. In a large pretest, response was received from 87.3 percent of the next of kin of the decedents. The pretest included several methodologic studies to increase the level and quality of response in the main survey. Response rates were compared for data collection by mail, telephone, and personal interview. A test of certified mail and first class mail was conducted. Response to two forms of different lengths was compared. An experiment was also conducted on the effect of inclusion of boxes for a \"don't know\" response.

A sample of 98 pregnant women were asked to complete a questionnaire investigation attitudes, social norms, perceived barriers to exercise, and intention regarding exercising after giving birth. Also determined were age, education level, exercise habits, number of months elapsed since onset of present pregnancy, and number of children. The regressions of intentions to exercise on all variables yielded R2 of 0.52 for nulliparous and 0.60 for pluriparous pregnant women. Important differences in variables that explained intentions were found between both groups of women, with perceived barriers to exercise being a key predictor that was, in turn, influenced by previous experience with pregnancy. It is suggested that the experience of the postnatal period modifies the interrelation between the variables explaining intentions regarding exercise after giving birth. Consequently, the programs should take into account the impact that the birth of a first child will have on the perceived barriers to exercise.\r"

At present, there is no way to estimate the number of AIDS patients who will be living in 1991. Intestinal diseases exert considerable morbidity and mortality on AIDS patients and persons with AIDS-related complex. The elevated frequency of certain intestinal infectious diseases in homosexual male AIDS patients has been attributed to sexual practices, but food seems a probable vector for some proportion of the infections in all AIDS-affected groups. Intestinal infectious diseases and resulting systemic infections can be life-threatening to AIDS patients. The infections may serve as cofactors that hasten HIV disease progression to AIDS, but absolute proof of this hypothesis is lacking. The longer the HIV-infected person maintains good general health and avoids potentially lethal infectious diseases, the better are the chances that effective treatments will be developed and made available. Foodborne diseases are generally avoidable, and increased education of AIDS patients and their physicians as to their nature is the key to their prevention.\r"

Bone-reinforcement lines were common, but no characteristic mineral mass alteration was established. Looser zones were more prevalent in older subjects. Osteoarthritis was common, occurring in the ankles, knees, feet, sacroiliac joints, and wrists. Enthesopathy was infrequent in the younger group but was present in every member of the intermediate and older groups and was often accompanied by extra ossicles. Curvatures of the lower-extremity long bones were common in all age groups. Three new skeletal alterations in XLH were found to be common: flaring of the iliac wings, trapezoidal distal femoral condyles, and alterations in talar morphology, including shortening of the talar neck and flattening of the talar dome. Technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate scintigrams of 17 subjects were often abnormal, depicting bowing deformity and focal tracer accumulation in diaphyseal cortices and in periarticular and extraarticular regions. The mean metabolic index was moderately elevated (4.0). Both radiographic and scintigraphic findings were more severe in men, consistent with hemizygosity. The natural history of untreated XLH in both sexes is characterized by the development of a variety of age-related skeletal abnormalities during adulthood.\r"

A total dose of 16-50 Gy was administered in either one fraction or two fractions 8 days apart. The concentration of dose within the target volume allowed reduction of dose absorbed by adjacent critical structures of the intact brain. Patients were followed up for 11-48 months. Twelve of 14 patients had a partial or complete response to treatment, as demonstrated by CT. Stereotactic radiation therapy appears to be effective in the control of small radioresistant cerebral neoplasms, without damaging surrounding healthy tissues.\r"

  ".W": "During infection the vascular endothelial cell (EC) undergoes important immunologic alterations leading to increased leukocyte-EC adherence and initiation of a host inflammatory response. ECs express class 2 immune response genes and the interleukin 1 gene to a greater degree during infection and thus may be capable of amplifying the lymphocytic proliferative process. Lymphokines generated from stimulated lymphocytes, notably interferon-gamma, may in turn further enhance EC-leukocyte adherence and class 2 antigenic presentation by ECs. The ECs of different organ systems appear variable in terms of their immunologic capabilities. Infection of the endothelium has been demonstrated for an array of human pathogens, and even subclinical infection of ECs may ultimately assume importance in disease processes such as atherosclerosis. A potential role of the EC in the pathogenesis of newer infectious diseases, such as AIDS, is becoming evident and warrants further attention.\r"

In this article, two cases of endocarditis--both due to Streptococcus faecalis with high-level gentamicin resistance and both presenting in an atypical manner--are described. The data suggest that a high level of suspicion regarding a diagnosis of endocarditis must be maintained in such cases and that, once a case is diagnosed, careful evaluation in the microbiology laboratory is helpful in determining the optimal antimicrobial regimen.\r"

Androgen deficiency was divided into primary testicular failure and \"hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction\" by an androgen quotient derived using simultaneous gonadotropin and testosterone levels. This androgen quotient was found to correlate well with the response to testosterone and was more useful than the testosterone level in predicting which patients would benefit from long-term testosterone replacement. Unsuspected hypothyroidism (6%) and hyperprolactinemia (3%) were both common in this group of patients, and appropriate treatment reversed the impotence.\r"

In two groups of patients, anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, maintained with 70% nitrous oxide in 30% oxygen, and either halothane (n = 10) or a continuous infusion of alfentanil (n = 10). The administration of the allocated anesthetic was adjusted according to strict predefined criteria of inadequate anesthesia. After endotracheal intubation, hemodynamics (heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressure) changed less in the alfentanil group (P less than .01). Overall hemodynamic stability was the same in both groups. In neither group was there recall of intraoperative events. Recovery was assessed by the time from cessation of nitrous oxide administration to return of spontaneous ventilation, response to simple command, extubation, orientation, and discharge from the recovery area. The time taken to respond to simple command was significantly shorter in the alfentanil group (P less than .05), but other indices of recovery were similar.\r"

The latter achieved hypoadrenocorticism and a substantial reduction of tumor size. During the initial period, worsening hyperadrenocorticism resulted in a rise of atrial natriuretic factor and an inhibition of renin activity, consistent with an increase of cortisol and plasma volume. Changes in opposite direction were observed after treatment with mitotane.\r"

In 1985, before approval of the nonionic contrast agents by the Food and Drug Administration, 6006 consecutive patients received iv ionic agents for urography or CT. After approval of the nonionic agents, 7170 consecutive patients referred for the same examinations were studied. The two groups of patients were significantly different, but the differences were small and did not uniformly favor either group. The incidence of adverse effects in the patients given ionic contrast material was significantly higher than that of the nonionic group (4.17% vs 0.69%, p less than .001). The reactions were also more severe in the ionic group than in the nonionic group (p less than .005). A patient questionnaire disclosed that many patients did not feel well for hours to days after the procedure and also did not immediately resume normal activities of daily living. The nonionic agent was significantly less distressful than the ionic agent. We conclude that nonionic agents cause fewer and less severe adverse effects. Reducing adverse effects can save the patient or the examining site either time or money. However, this study does not show that nonionic agents are more cost-effective than ionic agents.\r"

  ".W": "By inducing minimal free-fibrinolytic activity with low dose urokinase, the lag phase of prourokinase can be overcome, and the rate of thrombolysis with this substance can be strongly enhanced. The thrombolytic potency of a combination of 250,000 IU of urokinase and 2 doses of prourokinase (4.5 or 6.5 megaunits) was evaluated in an open-label, nonrandomized dose-finding study. Thirty-one patients participated. With 4.5 megaunits of prourokinase (group 1, 15 patients) patency was demonstrated angiographically at 60 minutes in 33% while with 6.5 megaunits (group II, 16 patients) 75% patency was achieved (p less than 0.01). A second angiogram recorded 24 to 36 hours after thrombolysis revealed reocclusion in 60 versus 8% of primarily patent coronary arteries (p less than 0.05). Hemostatic monitoring in both groups revealed only slight to moderate consumption of fibrinogen (-9 vs -13%), plasminogen (-29 vs -34%) and alpha 2-antiplasmin (-59 vs -63%), and an increase in D-dimers, the split products of cross-linked fibrin, to a maximum of 1.008 +/- 1.211 vs 0.547 +/- 0.684 micrograms/liter. None of these differences was significant. Bleeding complications were more frequently observed in group II (13 vs 37%) (difference not significant), but were mild and related to puncture sites, except in 1 patient with mild oozing from the gum. No major hemorrhage was observed. These results suggest that low dose urokinase preactivation enhances the thrombolytic potency of prourokinase, without affecting its high fibrin specificity. Compared to previous studies using only prourokinase, low dose urokinase preactivation reduces by 50% the prourokinase dose as required for effective thrombolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-seven had atrial fibrillation and 2 had atrial flutter. Patients were entered into the study if the arrhythmia persisted for at least 15 minutes with a ventricular rate greater than 120 beats/min. Fifteen patients were randomized to flecainide (group 1) and 14 to digoxin (group 2). Flecainide was given as a bolus of 1 mg/kg over 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/hr for 1 hour and then 0.25 mg/kg/hr for the rest of the study period (24 hours). Digoxin was given as 3 bolus doses (0.5 mg followed after 6 and 12 hours by 0.25 mg). In both groups, 10 mg of verapamil was given intravenously after 45 minutes if the arrhythmia persisted with a mean ventricular rate greater than 100 beats/min. The antiarrhythmic efficacy was assessed by 24-hour Holter monitoring and frequent 15-second rhythm strips. Within 45 minutes control of arrhythmia, which was maintained for the rest of the study period, was achieved in 10 of 15 patients in group 1 and 2 of 14 in group 2 (p less than 0.01).

  ".W": "The major processing steps in the maturation of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid beta-glucosidase, were examined in fibroblasts from normal individuals and from patients with types 1 and 2 Gaucher disease. In pulse-chase studies with normal fibroblasts, remodeling of N-linked oligosaccharides resulted in the temporal appearance of three molecular-weight forms of acid beta-glucosidase. An initial 64-kDa form, containing high mannose-type oligosaccharide side chains, was processed quantitatively, within 24 h, to a sialylated 69-kDa form. During the subsequent 96 h, some of the 69-kDa form is processed to 59 kDa. Glycosidase digestion studies revealed that the increase in the apparent molecular weight of the normal enzyme from 64 kDa to 69 kDa resulted primarily from the addition to sialic acid residues in the Golgi apparatus. The polypeptide backbone of both the 64-kDa and 69-kDa forms was 55.3 kDa. Processing of acid beta-glucosidase in fibroblasts from three of four type 1 (nonneuronopathic) Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher disease patients was nearly normal. With fibroblasts from one Ashkenazi Jewish and three non-Jewish type 1 as well as from two type 2 (acute neuronopathic) Gaucher disease patients, only a 64-kDa form of acid beta-glucosidase was detected. Inefficient and incomplete processing to the 69-kDa form was found in one type 2 cell line (GM2627). These results indicate that no firm correlation exists between the type or degree of abnormal processing of acid beta-glucosidase in fibroblasts and the phenotype of Gaucher disease.\r"

There was a significant increase in urine flow rate (0.81 +/- 0.06 to 1.81 +/- 0.23 ml/min, p less than 0.01), sodium excretion rate (56 +/- 14 to 80 +/- 23 microEq/min, p less than 0.01), fractional excretion of sodium (1.23 +/- 0.49 to 1.63 +/- 0.60 percent, p less than 0.01) and potassium excretion rate (35 +/- 7 to 42 +/- 6 microEq/min, p less than 0.02). However, no significant alterations in renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate were observed. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the change in urine flow rate or sodium excretion rate and the change in renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate, respectively. In addition, there was no significant effect on cardiac index, mean aortic or left ventricular filling pressures, or systemic vascular resistance. There also was no discernible relationship between the response to ANF and the baseline concentrations of plasma ANF, aldosterone, or plasma renin activity. Thus, in patients with congestive heart failure, low dose ANF boluses may produce an increase in urine flow rate and sodium excretion rate that is independent of renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate. This suggests a meaningful direct renal tubular effect of exogenous ANF in this setting.\r"

This investigation was designed to determine if the plasma concentration(s) of three newly described hormones synthesized in the heart are increased in patients with hyperthyroidism and/or decreased in patients with hypothyroidism compared to normal subjects. The three hormones consist of amino acids 1-30, 31-67, and 99-126 (ANF) of the 126 amino acid prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor. Prohormone atrial natriuretic peptides (pro ANFs) 1-30, 31-67, and ANF were increased threefold, fourfold, and twofold respectively in hyperthyroid patients compared to the mean circulating concentration of 54 healthy persons without thyroid disease. Plasma concentrations of the three peptides in hypothyroid patients were only one-half that of the 54 persons without thyroid disease. With appropriate treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, the levels of the three peptides returned to normal. The peptide hormones increased proportionately with the increasing dosages of L-thyroxine of 50 micrograms/day and 100 micrograms/day in the hypothyroid patients. In persons with hypothyroidism complicated by congestive heart failure, the levels of pro ANFs 1-30, 31-67, and 99-126 were increased, demonstrating that abnormalities of salt and water metabolism are a strong stimulus to the release of these peptides.\r"

The light chain deposits from myocardium were extracted in 6 M guanidine-HCl under reducing conditions, partially purified by column chromatography, and analyzed by immunoblotting and amino-terminal sequencing. The extracted material contained four main bands reactive with anti-kappa antibody: intact kappa light chain (MW, 28 kd), under reducing conditions, and 3 fragments (MW, 20, 16, and 15 kd). As revealed by the aminoterminal sequencing performed on three of the four bands, the intact light chain molecule and two fragments belong to the kappa I subgroup. Thus, similar to light chain amyloid (AL), the deposits in LCDD are derived from both intact light chain and fragments. Unlike in AL, amyloid P component was not detected in the deposits of this patient or those examined previously. The differences demonstrated thus far between AL and LCDD are the lack of fibrils and amyloid P component in LCDD, suggesting that local tissue factors may be responsible for different processing of the light chain deposits in LCDD.\r"

  ".W": "The author reviews the immunophenotypic profiles displayed by the major clinicopathologic categories of T cell neoplasia, the immunophenotypic criteria useful in the immunodiagnosis of T cell neoplasia, and the contributions made by antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis to the understanding of T cell neoplasia. Neoplasms belonging to distinct clinicopathologic categories of T cell neoplasia often exhibit characteristic immunophenotypic profiles. Approximately 80% of lymphoblastic lymphomas and 20% of acute lymphoblastic leukemias express phenotypes consistent with prethymic and intrathymic stages of T cell differentiation, including intranuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas of mycosis fungoides type usually express pan-T cell antigens CD2, CD5, and CD3, often lack the pan-T cell antigen CD7, and usually express the mature, peripheral helper subset phenotype, CD4+ CD8-. Cutaneous T cell lymphomas of nonmycosis fungoides type and peripheral T cell lymphomas often lack one or more pan-T cell antigens and, in addition, occasionally express the anomalous CD4+ CD8+ or CD4- CD8- phenotypes. T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease is divisable into two broad categories: those cases that are CD3 antigen positive and exhibit clonal T cell receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangements and those cases that are CD3 antigen negative and exhibit the TCR-beta gene germline configuration. Human T cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) associated Japanese, Carribean, and sporadic adult T cell leukemia/lymphomas usually express pan-T cell antigens, the CD4+ CD8- phenotype, and various T cell-associated activation antigens, including the interleukin-2 receptor (CD25). Immunophenotypic criteria useful in the immunodiagnosis of T cell neoplasia include, in increasing order of utility, T cell predominance, T cell subset antigen restriction, anomalous T cell subset antigen expression, and deletion of one or more pan-T cell antigens. Only in exceptional circumstances do normal, non-neoplastic T cell populations express the CD4- CD8- or the CD4+ CD8+ phenotype and/or lack one or more pan-T cell antigens. T cell receptor beta chain gene rearrangement analysis represents an accurate, objective, and sensitive molecular genetic marker of T cell lineage and clonality that allows discrimination among non-T cell, polyclonal T cell and monoclonal T cell populations. Non-T cells exhibit the TCR-beta gene germline configuration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Synthetic analogs of sex pheromones from Streptococcus faecalis and related pheromone inhibitors have been assayed for their possible effects on human neutrophil leukocyte activation. These sex pheromones are hydrophobic peptides that have regulatory roles in bacterial mating behavior leading to intercellular plasmid transfer. Five of the seven peptides tested were chemotactic for neutrophils in the 10(-5) to 10(-6) M concentration range. Exposure of neutrophils to these same peptides induced polarization of the cells and triggered superoxide production. Cross-desensitization experiments suggest that S. faecalis bacterial peptides act via the fMLF-receptor on neutrophils. This conclusion is supported by the results that leukocyte polarization responses induced by synthetic analogs of S. faecalis sex pheromones can be blocked by t-Boc-FLFLF, a known antagonist of fMLF. It is concluded that inflammatory properties of bacterial supernatants, particularly in the case of S. faecalis strains and perhaps in other bacterial genuses, are contributed in part by nonformylated hydrophobic oligopeptides that recognize and act through the fMLF receptor to activate neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "Normal cultured human epidermal melanocytes and melanoma cells derived from three different malignant melanomas were examined for synthesis of extracellular matrix components before and after treatment for one day with interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or both. Treatment of the cells with either cytokine individually had minimal effects on fibronectin levels. Treatment of the cells with the two agents in combination greatly stimulated fibronectin production as indicated by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synthesis of laminin was decreased slightly by the same treatment whereas thrombospondin production was stimulated slightly. The same treatment reduced melanocyte viability slightly but significantly inhibited proliferation and altered the morphology of the melanocytes. The treated cells became flattened and polygonal in shape while the untreated cells exhibited a bipolar shape with one or more long dendritic processes. These morphologic changes were not seen in cultures treated with interferon-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha individually. The effects of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on fibronectin production by epidermal melanocytes are in contrast to the effects of the same treatments on fibronectin production by epidermal keratinocytes where fibronectin production is decreased but are similar to the effects of transforming growth factor-beta on a number of other cell types in which increased synthesis of fibronectin occurs and is associated with decreased growth.\r"

This time period included the closure and reopening of the local steel mill, the primary source of PM10. An association between elevated PM10 levels and hospital admissions for pneumonia, pleurisy, bronchitis, and asthma was observed. During months when 24-hour PM10 levels exceeded 150 micrograms/m3, average admissions for children nearly tripled; in adults, the increase in admissions was 44 per cent. During months with mean PM10 levels greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/m3 average admissions for children and adults increased by 89 and 47 per cent, respectively. During the winter months when the steel mill was open, PM10 levels were nearly double the levels experienced during the winter months when the mill was closed. This occurred even though relatively stagnant air was experienced during the winter the mill was closed. Children's admissions were two to three times higher during the winters when the mill was open compared to when it was closed. Regression analysis also revealed that PM10 levels were strongly correlated with hospital admissions. They were more strongly correlated with children's admissions than with adult admissions and were more strongly correlated with admissions for bronchitis and asthma than with admissions for pneumonia and pleurisy.\r"

Two were based on the measurement of minimum inspired and two on end-expired carbon dioxide. The four A systems performed similarly with each individual definition. The rebreathing points found for each individual breathing system differed markedly between definitions, with those determined by the minimum inspired CO2 occurring at low, and probably misleading, FGF/VE ratio. The Bain system demonstrated rebreathing at considerably higher fresh gas flows whichever definition was used.\r"

The native t-PA (AK-124) was obtained from human-derived normal cells. Experimental canine coronary thrombosis was produced by partial constriction and endothelial denudation of the vessel. In 19 dogs, coronary occlusive thrombus was produced. Three hours after total occlusion of the coronary artery with thrombus, the authors attempted the thrombolytic therapy in 16 dogs. Histologically, three-hour thrombus was composed of a mixture of platelet aggregates, fibrin, and blood cells. They infused 0.375 mg/kg t-PA intravenously in 7 dogs and 20,000 IU/kg urokinase (UK) in 9. Coronary recanalization was achieved in 5 (71%) with t-PA infusion and 6 (67%) with UK infusion. Plasma fibrinogen levels decreased to 76% of preinfusion value in the dogs with t-PA infusion and to 34% in those with UK infusion. Coronary reocclusion occurred in 2 dogs with t-PA and 3 with UK. Thus, the native t-PA (AK-124) can provide coronary thrombolysis without severe depletion of plasma fibrinogen levels.\r"

Labeling yields were 95%, and in vivo decay showed a high stability with a mean biologic half-life of eleven hours. The first-passage radionuclide technique for determination of cardiac output using the above-mentioned tracer was evaluated by using the left ventricle as area-of-interest with individual background correction after complete mixing of the tracer. This technique showed a high level of agreement with invasive methods. By combining this method for measurement of the forward stroke volume with the multigated equilibrium principle for determination of the total left ventricular stroke volume using similar background corrections, an exact evaluation of regurgitation fractions was obtained. In patients with aortic and mitral valve disease the noninvasive radionuclide technique gave similar but probably more accurate results as compared with contrast aortography and ventriculography. The radionuclide technique may be suitable for monitoring and selecting patients for surgical treatment.\r"

For four hours after administration of the study drug, pulmonary responses were measured, followed by a CAHC. There was a significant improvement in pulmonary function on the 120-mg and 240-mg days. The percent drop in FEV1 to CAHC was determined by comparing the pre-challenge baseline to the challenge responses. There was a significant attenuation in the FEV1 fall immediately after challenge on active drug days, but it was not sustained. Terfenadine appears to have an attenuating effect against CAHC-induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

  ".U": "89205981\r", 
  ".W": "There is controversy regarding the use of alkalinizing agents during reperfusion after cardiac arrest. The potential deleterious effects of sodium bicarbonate (bicarb) administration, including paradoxic cerebral acidosis, have led to the search for alternative agents. Tromethamine (tris) is a non-CO2-generating buffer that has been proposed for use during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The purpose of this experiment was to compare the ability of tris with bicarb to correct brain pH (pH B) during reperfusion after a 12-minute cardiac arrest. Adult mongrel dogs were instrumented and placed in the bore of a Bruker Biospec 1.89 tesla superconducting magnet system. Ventricular fibrillation was induced; after 12 minutes, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated and maintained for two hours with minimum flows of 80 mL/kg/min. Bicarb (n = 5) or tris (n = 5) were administered to correct arterial pH as rapidly as possible. 31P NMR spectra were obtained at baseline and throughout ischemia and reperfusion. The pH B was determined with the inorganic phosphate relative to the phosphocreatine resonance signal shift. Profile analysis indicates a difference between groups (P less than .02) related to an initial delay in pH B correction in the tris group. By 48 minutes of reperfusion, pH B did not differ between the groups. Moreover, there was no evidence of paradoxic cerebral acidosis in the bicarb group. Although tris corrects blood pH as quickly as bicarb, it is less effective in correcting pH B. Absence of paradoxic acidosis may be caused by efficient elimination of CO2 by cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

  ".W": "Capnography is a useful tool in differentiating tracheal from esophageal intubation. It may be an especially useful tool in emergency airway management by rescue squads or in the emergency department. However, in clinical practice the question has arisen as to whether prior ingestion of carbonated beverages can generate false-positive capnographic evidence of endotracheal intubation when in fact esophageal intubation has occurred. To answer this question, we compared the difference between tracheal and esophageal capnographic waveforms in dogs in the setting of recent ingestion of carbonated beverages. Esophageal capnographic recordings from three of five dogs undergoing esophageal ventilation were strikingly positive for exhaled carbon dioxide; however, the waveforms were significantly different from waveforms of tracheal ventilation. We conclude that esophageal intubation, after recent ingestion of carbonated beverages, may give false-positive waveforms suggestive of tracheal intubation. Rapidly diminishing CO2 concentrations, however, help differentiate esophageal from tracheal ventilation in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports concerning the treatment of gastroschisis suggest that primary closure results in more rapid return of gastrointestinal function, a shortened hospitalization, diminished perinatal complications, and improved long-term survival. A 4-year retrospective review of infants treated for gastroschisis at the University of Florida yielded 30 infants requiring repair of this abdominal wall defect. The series included 19 males and 11 females, and the average abdominal wall defect measured 4 cm in its greatest dimension. Nine infants (mean weight, 2,275 gm) were repaired using a staged closure using a silastic (six) or cutaneous (three) silo. Complete fascial closure was accomplished in an average of 8 days in the silastic group and 15 days in the infants with skin flaps. Mean age at start of enteral feeds was 23 days, with complete oral feedings at 43 days. Twenty-one infants (mean weight, 2,127 gm) underwent primary fascial closure. Three deaths occurred in the perioperative period: one from acute renal failure and two from sepsis secondary to a segment of necrotic intestine. An additional infant developed postoperative necrotizing entercolitis but recovered. Two infants in this group also had jejuno-ileal atresia requiring extensive small bowel resection. In the remaining 15 infants, oral alimentation was initiated for an average of 23 days, with full oral alimentation at 46 days. The data suggest that the recovery of the gastrointestinal system, adequate enough to support total oral alimentation, is unrelated to the initial surgical procedure chosen to obtain fascial closure in the newborn with gastroschisis. In addition, vigorous attempts at primary fascial closure may jeopardize intestinal viability, diminish ventilatory function, and result in unnecessary morbidity and mortality.\r"

Using mannitol and lactulose as probe molecules we have carried out a cross sectional study of intestinal permeability in patients with active Crohn's disease (n = 17) and control subjects (n = 31). Activity was assessed by an activity index score. The lactulose:mannitol urinary excretion ratio was significantly increased in Crohn's disease. Overall sensitivity was 82%, and 92% when activity was moderate or severe. When permeability was compared with the activity index there was a significant correlation among patients. In five patients studied longitudinally a significant correlation was also present. Measurement of intestinal permeability is non-invasive, and may be useful both as a screening test in patients with non-specific symptoms, and for the assessment of the extent of disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.\r"

These included all patients in the 10 most prevalent medical and surgical diagnosis related groups. Using analysis of covariance to correct for age, sex, diagnosis related group, urgency of admission, temporal change, and mortality, we found no differences in length of stay, total charges, or categories of ancillary charges. These results suggest that there is no substantial increase in the cost of care early in the training year; there was no evidence of a \"July phenomenon.\"\r"

To explore the possibility of reversing such damage, we conducted a double-blind, multicenter study with misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, which has demonstrated mucosal protective, gastric antisecretory, and ulcer healing properties. We also studied possible interference of misoprostol with continuing aspirin treatment in the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with confirmed rheumatoid arthritis and endoscopically documented gastroduodenal lesions were randomly assigned to receive 200 micrograms of misoprostol four times a day (123 patients) or placebo (116 patients). Each concurrently received 650 to 1300 mg of aspirin four times a day. After eight weeks of treatment, misoprostol was statistically superior to placebo in healing gastric mucosal injury (70% vs 25%) and duodenal mucosal injury (86% vs 53%). Patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers on admission had superior ulcer healing rates with misoprostol (67% vs 26%). There was no evidence of interference with the antirheumatic properties of aspirin. Mild to moderate adverse experiences were equally noted in misoprostol and placebo groups. Misoprostol, coadministered with aspirin, is well tolerated and highly effective in healing aspirin-associated gastroduodenal lesions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis without altering the therapeutic benefits of aspirin.\r"

To determine if the high levels of serum T4 have undesirable metabolic effects, despite the fact that the subjects are accepted as euthyroid, we studied 28 patients receiving long-term levothyroxine therapy; 19 patients were considered to be receiving replacement dosages and nine suppressive dosages of levothyroxine. To assess the effect of levothyroxine on target tissue, we measured the thyrotropin response to protirelin and systolic time intervals obtained by simultaneous electrocardiography and echocardiography. Thyrotropin response to protirelin was suppressed in patients with elevated serum T4 levels and normal serum triiodothyronine levels. These patients also had shortened systolic time intervals typical of hyperthyroidism. Our data indicate that commonly given replacement dosages of levothyroxine may induce undesirable metabolic consequences and that these patients perhaps ought to be seen as having \"subclinical hyperthyroidism.\" The prescribed dosage of levothyroxine as therapy for hypothyroidism is still frequently excessive.\r"

We studied physicians enrolled in an independent practitioner association who see both fee-for-service and prepaid (health maintenance organization [HMO]) patients concurrently. We asked the following questions: (1) Do physicians order fewer tests for their patients enrolled in an HMO relative to their patients seen on a fee-for-service basis? (2) Are any reductions in testing selective or indiscriminate? We reviewed the charts of 273 new patients, 167 enrolled in a fee-for-service system and 106 enrolled in an HMO, who were seen by 17 physicians \"for a check-up,\" and graded test use as \"indicated\" or \"discretionary.\" We used multiple logistic regression to control for the effects of patient age and sex. Patients in the HMO underwent fewer tests than did patients in the fee-for-service system, as well as fewer discretionary tests, but received the same proportion of preventive services. We conclude that physicians ordered fewer tests for patients in the HMO, apparently because of selective omission of discretionary tests. Physicians also did not reduce preventive services for patients in the HMO relative to all other physicians.\r"

There have been recent reports of the association of lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies with severe valvular heart disease in patients with SLE and it has been suggested that organizing thrombus on the surface of the valve may be a cause of distortion and subsequent dysfunction. We describe two patients who did not have SLE, but who did have both lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies. Both had severe valvular heart disease, the pathology of which demonstrates valve distortion by layers of organizing thrombus identical to that of previously described patients with SLE. The gross appearance of these valves is similar to that of the valves in \"rheumatic\" heart disease. We suggest that in some patients with \"rheumatic\" heart disease, but without a history of rheumatic fever, the prothrombotic tendency associated with lupus anticoagulant and phospholipid antibodies may either contribute to, or be responsible for, the pathogenesis of \"rheumatic\" type valve deformities.\r"

In ganglioneuromas, all three markers were observed both in ganglion cells and in neurofibrils. All cases of ganglioneuroblastoma were positive for these markers, however, some variability of staining intensity was noted. Of the 33 cases of neuroblastomas, all were positive for NSE, 23 (70%) for CG, and 31 (94%) for SYP. Neuron-specific enolase was detected not only in the majority of the neuroblasts showing signs of differentiation, but also in some undifferentiated neuroblasts. Chromogranin was found mainly in differentiated neuroblasts with enlarged cytoplasm and nuclei, but was scarcely found in undifferentiated cells. Synaptophysin was detected in some undifferentiated neuroblasts, as well as in differentiated neuroblasts. Two cases without SYP-positive cells were also negative for CG. Our observations conclude that antibodies against NSE and SYP are helpful as a diagnostic aid for neuroblastic tumors.\r"

End-tidal PCO2 and the tidal excursion of the abdomen were unchanged. Hypercapnic ventilatory response decreased significantly following extradural anaesthesia, principally because of the rib cage component. The slope of the abdominal component did not change significantly. The results indicate that mechanical impairment of rib cage movement can produce decreased ventilatory response to carbon dioxide. The ventilatory impairment and the changes in breathing pattern induced by the high thoracic extradural anaesthesia probably reflect blockade of the efferent or afferent pathway (or both) of the intercostal nerve roots.\r"

Anaesthesia was induced with a sleep dose of thiopentone preceded by glycopyrrolate. Suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1 was used to facilitate laryngoscopy (which lasted 10 s) and tracheal intubation. Arterial pressure, heart rate and noradrenaline concentration in mixed venous plasma increased significantly after suxamethonium, and increased further after laryngoscopy and intubation in the control group (n = 10). The QT interval of the ECG was prolonged after the administration of suxamethonium, and was prolonged further after laryngoscopy and intubation. All these changes were attenuated in patients pretreated with alfentanil (n = 10), but four patients had chest wall rigidity. Changes in the QT interval correlated directly with the changes in plasma noradrenaline concentration (r = 0.67). Plasma adrenaline concentrations decreased during induction of anaesthesia in both groups.\r"

They all underwent minor paediatric surgical procedures. The influence on VCO2 of age, operation, premedication, caudal anaesthesia, and different volatile anaesthetic agents was investigated. The volume of exhaled gas, during three- to five-minute collection periods, was measured and the fraction of exhaled CO2 was determined by a CO2 meter. Under basal anaesthetic conditions, the average output before operation followed the equation: VCO2 (ml.min-1) = -1.25X + 13.0X2, in which X = lne (body weight, kg). Expressed on a weight basis, the youngest infants (weighing less than 5 kg) had the lowest VCO2. Higher values were measured up to a body weight of 10 kg above which a negative correlation occurred between VCO2 (ml.min-1.kg-1) and body weight. The use of premedication resulted in a more variable VCO2 during operations than when opioid premedication was not used. The combination of a general anaesthetic and caudal anaesthesia stabilized VCO2. Also, children anaesthetized with halothane had a higher VCO2 than those who were anaesthetized with enflurane or isoflurane (P less than 0.05). The variable VCO2 emphasizes the need for increased monitoring of VCO2 during routine anaesthesia and operation in infants and children.\r"

These results were similar to those observed during Caesarean section and those during anaesthesia for post-delivery tubal ligations.

Pharmacokinetic disposition was first order and was well described by a two-compartment open model. Central-compartment volume of distribution was 0.131 +/- 0.087 L.kg-1 (mean +/- SD) in young healthy volunteers and decreased modestly with increasing age (r = -0.32, P less than 0.05). However, apparent volume of distribution at steady-state, 0.404 +/- 0.205 L.kg-1 for the whole study cohort, was not age-related. Plasma clearance of alfentanil in young healthy subjects, 9.3 +/- 6.3 ml.kg-1.min-1, also showed an inverse relationship with age (r = -0.54, P less than 0.001), and was not affected by surgical stress in subjects older than 60 years. Cigarette smoking and sex of the subjects did not contribute to interindividual differences in the kinetic disposition of this drug. Our finding that interindividual differences in disposition of alfentanil were the least in older subjects suggests that its pharmacological effects related to pharmacokinetic disposition should be most predictable in the elderly.\r"

Responsiveness of pial arterioles to ACh, methacholine, and nicotine was studied using a closed cranial window. Pial arteriolar diameter was measured using intravital microscopy. Pial arteriolar responses to ACh, 10(-8)-10(-4)M, applied to the cortical surface, were variable and dose-dependent. At low concentration, 10(-7)M, 45% of the arterioles increased diameter by 9 +/- 1%, 19% responded by decreasing diameter by 9 +/- 1%, and 35% did not respond. The response to high concentration, 10(-4)M, was a profound decrease in diameter, 28 +/- 3%, in 78% of the arterioles studied. These effects were abolished by atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). Muscarinic agonist, methacholine, 10(-5)-10(-3)M, also resulted in a decrease in cerebral vascular diameter, while nicotine, 10(-6)-10(-4)M, had no effect. In six animals, administration of cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.), blocked the response to 10(-4)M ACh but did not affect the response to 10(-7)M ACh. In five animals, administration of lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (2 mg/kg i.v.) augmented the vasoconstrictor response at both ACh concentrations. The data suggest that, in the newborn piglet, vasoactive prostanoids released following cholinergic activation of a muscarinic-type receptor mediate vasoconstriction in cerebral arterioles.\r"

The objective of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the increase in hematocrit in rats given atriopeptin-24 (AP-24). Infusion of AP-24 for 30 minutes increased large vessel and total vascular hematocrits by 10-15% while decreasing microvascular hematocrits by 9-26% in numerous tissues. Regional vascular permeation by [131I] bovine serum albumin was markedly increased (2-5.6-fold) in many tissues, consistent with a 16% decrease in plasma volume. AP-24 infusion had no effect on extracellular fluid volume or the volume of circulating red cells. Vascular resistance was decreased and was associated with a significant increase in blood flow in many, but not all, tissues. In the atrium and in the small and large intestine the percentage decrease in microvascular hematocrit exceeded the increase in blood flow. These observations indicate that the increase in large vessel hematocrit induced by AP-24 infusion 1) is accompanied by a decrease in (microvascular) hematocrit in many tissues, 2) reflects an increase in overall (i.e., total vascular hematocrit), and 3) is the consequence of a decrease in plasma volume resulting from a marked increase in the rate of vascular permeation by plasma constituents in multiple tissues.\r"

The role of the endothelium in the vascular hyperreactivity in hypercholesterolemic and atherosclerotic coronary arteries was examined, particularly in response to aggregating and related vasoactive substances. Male Yorkshire pigs underwent balloon endothelial denudation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and 2% high-cholesterol feeding for 10 weeks. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated a full lining of endothelial cells in the LAD and the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX). Endothelium-dependent responses were examined in vitro. In cholesterol-fed animals, endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets, serotonin, ADP, bradykinin, thrombin, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were depressed in LAD (atherosclerosis), while the relaxations to aggregating platelets, serotonin and ADP were depressed in LCX (hypercholesterolemia). Serotonin-induced contractions were endothelium-dependently augmented in atherosclerotic LAD; the endothelium-dependent component of the contractions was inhibited by blockers of cyclooxygenase. Bioassay studies demonstrated a depressed release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) from the atherosclerotic LAD in response to serotonin. These experiments indicate that the endothelium-dependent relaxations to aggregating platelets and related vasoactive substances are severely impaired in atherosclerosis and moderately impaired in hypercholesterolemia. Since coronary atherosclerosis was induced by a combination of balloon endothelial injury (and regeneration) and high-cholesterol feeding in this study, the combined effects of those factors must account for the severely impaired responses in atherosclerosis. The depressed release of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) and the concomitant release of vasoconstrictor product(s) of cyclooxygenase appear to be responsible for the impaired relaxations.\r"

The present study was undertaken to investigate if the adenylate cyclase system in the rat heart was affected by malnutrition. Three different animal groups with malnutrition were compared with a control group: rats with acute starvation for 14-96 hours, rats with protein-calorie malnutrition for 2 weeks, and rats with tumors. Stimulation by beta-adrenergic receptors and inhibition by muscarinic receptors of adenylate cyclase activity were not altered by malnutrition. However, conditions used for in vitro adenylate cyclase determinations were, of necessity, not physiological. Neither did the number of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors change. When competition-binding experiments were performed, differences comprising agonist affinity and affinity state distribution were noted among the groups. The myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors formed a reduced number of high-affinity sites in all groups as compared with the control rats. All high-affinity sites displayed a more than 10-fold increase in affinity toward isoproterenol and an impaired sensitivity to guanine nucleotides except in heart membranes derived from rats starved less than 48 hours. While the protein-calorie restricted and the tumor-bearing rats had myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors that were unresponsive to guanine nucleotides, after 48 hours of starvation the rats exhibited an attenuated guanine-nucleotide-induced affinity shift. No changes associated with malnutrition in myocardial membrane levels of the of the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein were detected by cholera-toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This is of particular interest in chronic renal failure, in which first, increased sodium and water retention plays a major pathogenetic role in the development of hypertension, and second, altered secretion and/or metabolism of alpha-hANP may contribute to fluid volume and BP regulation. In the present study the relationship between renal function, BP, and circulating alpha-hANP was investigated in 16 non-dialyzed patients with stable chronic renal failure (CRF) without edema. Analysis of potential molecular heterogeneity of immunoreactive (ir) ANP was performed by gel permeation chromatography of plasma extracts from normotensive patients with CRF. Serum creatinine concentrations averaged 435 +/- 76 mumol/l ranging from 127 to 1187 mumol/l, systolic and diastolic BP averaged 158 +/- 4 and 94 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. Plasma alpha-hANP concentrations ranged from 5 to 75 with a mean of 23 +/- 4 pmol/l as compared to a mean of 10 +/- 1 pmol/l in healthy volunteers (p less than 0.05). A significant linear correlation between plasma alpha-hANP and serum creatinine concentrations (r = 0.92) was observed; a weaker correlation was found between mean arterial pressure and alpha-hANP (r = 0.66). Chromatographic analysis revealed considerable amounts of higher molecular weight circulating ir-ANP, approximately 15,000 Da, in addition to the biologically active small mol wt ANP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The average preoperative motion in flexion and extension was 11.5 degrees. The average intraoperative motion was 82.7 degrees.

The average arc of motion in those patients able to sit at the follow-up evaluation was 41.5 degrees. Normal bone scans, alkaline phosphatase levels, and the mature roentgenographic appearance of HO were unreliable predictors of recurrence. The preoperative range of motion was the best predictor of improved postoperative range of motion since patients with retained motion did better than those with severe ankylosis. All six hips with severe recurrence had 0 degree of preoperative motion. The average degree of preoperative motion for all remaining hips was 15.3 degrees. The best predictor of recurrence was the roentgenographic grade of HO. Nineteen of 22 hips (86%) with a mild to severe recurrence had large amounts of bone preoperatively (Grades 3-5). Complications excluding recurrence occurred in 19 of 24 hips (79%) and included superficial wound infections in nine of 24 hips (38%) and deep persistent infections (osteomyelitis) in eight of 24 hips (33%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The failure load and maximum tensile strength of chromic catgut and two monofilament absorbable synthetic suture materials (polydioxanone and polytrimethylene carbonate) were measured up to six weeks after implantation in sheep as: (1) a suture securing a synovial incision and (2) coils located either within the synovial cavity of the knee or intramuscularly. Although all synovial wounds healed satisfactorily, the performances of the different materials varied. The strength of chromic gut was largely lost within a week and fragmentation occurred at Week 4. The synthetic materials lost their strength relatively slowly. Polytrimethylene carbonate degraded in a linear manner, remaining intact but with little strength by Week 6. Polydioxanone, though losing strength at a slower rate, tended to fragment early, which may be of clinical importance in situations of delayed wound healing.\r"

Mean CBF was 29.6 +/- 15.8 (SD) ml/100 g.min, significantly lower than the normal age-matched value in this laboratory of 44.9 +/- 6.2 ml/100 g.min (p less than .02). This depression did not correlate with changes in mean arterial pressure. Despite the reduction in CBF, the specific reactivity of the cerebral vasculature to changes in CO2 was normal, 1.3 +/- 0.9 ml/100 g.min/mm Hg. Brain blood flow is reduced in septic humans; the contribution of this reduction to the metabolic and functional changes observed in sepsis requires further study.\r"

Sixty-one patients (15 to 82 yr) had an inhospital mortality of 47%. The APACHE II score was significantly higher for nonsurvivors vs. survivors both on the day of admission (24.4 +/- 9.6 vs. 18.4 +/- 6.5; p less than .003) and also on the day TPN was started (21 +/- 8.6 vs. 16.4 +/- 5.6; p less than .002). However, at a 60% risk of dying, specificity was 96.9% and sensitivity 27.6%. The mean number of days before TPN was started was 3.2 and mean number of days on TPN was 9.2 (p = NS). We conclude that calculation of APACHE II score either on ICU admission or on the day TPN is considered does not seem useful in identifying patients who will not benefit from TPN.\r"

Transtracheal oxygen delivery and saline instillation were instituted immediately after inserting the device.

When these patients were compared with themselves on prior conventional IPPV, all had a decrease in PIP, an increase in Paw and most had a decrease in VE, with no change in PaCO2 and an increase in PaO2. The increase in Paw may have contributed to this improved arterial oxygenation. High levels of PIP and PEEP during IPPV have been identified as risk factors in the development of barotrauma and residual parenchymal pulmonary damage. We propose that PcIRV allows for adequate ventilation and oxygenation with decreases in PIP, extrinsically added PEEP and inspired O2 concentration. This mode of ventilation may decrease the morbidity associated with IPPV utilizing high PIP and PEEP.\r"

Atrial natriuretic factor was found in high concentrations in the pleural fluid of all of these patients. The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in pleural fluid was nearly equal to the concentration in plasma of these patients. Their plasma levels were double the plasma concentration of this peptide hormone in 54 persons without congestive heart failure.

  ".W": "For many patients with advanced chronic airflow limitation (COPD) the treatment of dyspnea remains inadequate despite medications, rehabilitation programs, and supplemental oxygen. Bilateral carotid body resection (BCBR) is a controversial operation which has been reported anecdotally to relieve dyspnea in such patients, but its risks and long-term effects are not known. We studied pulmonary function and the ventilatory response to exercise of three severely dyspneic COPD patients who had chosen independently and without our knowledge to undergo this operation. All three patients reported improvement in dyspnea following BCBR despite the absence of improvement in their severe airflow limitation (mean FEV1 = 0.71 L before and 0.67 L after BCBR). The three patients died 6, 18 and 36 months after the removal of their carotid bodies, still convinced of the efficacy of their surgery. Their reported relief of dyspnea was associated with substantial decreases in minute ventilation and deterioration in arterial blood gases. Arterial blood gases worsened both at rest (PO2 fell from 57 to 45 mm Hg; PCO2 rose from 45 to 57 mm Hg) and during identical steady state exercise (at peak exercise, PO2 fell from 46 to 37 mm Hg and PCO2 rose from 50 to 61 mm Hg) postoperatively. Total minute ventilation decreased postoperatively both at rest (-3.4 L/min, -25 percent) and with exercise (-9.4 L/min, -39 percent) primarily because of decreases in respiratory rate (from 21 to 16 breaths/min at rest and from 25 to 18 breaths/min with exercise), and this was associated with decreases in both oxygen uptake (-26 percent) and carbon dioxide production (-22 percent) for the same external exercise workload. Whether the reported improvement in dyspnea was due to decrease in ventilation resulting from decrease in respiratory drive, a surgical placebo effect or some other unestablished effect of removal of the carotid bodies deserves further study.\r"

The cold-air test employed a single episode of hyperventilation (target, 30 times the FEV1), and subsequent FEV1 changes were noted, a decrease of 10 percent being defined as a positive test result. For methacholine, subjects inhaled aerosols of increasing concentrations and the dose associated with a 20 percent decline in FEV1 (PC20) was noted; positive tests were defined as a 20 percent decrease at concentrations less than or equal to 8 mg/ml. Of the 140 patients, 65 had negative results on both challenges. Twelve patients had positive results on cold-air testing but negative responses to methacholine, and 17 had the opposite result. Among patients with positive results to either test, there was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between change in FEV1 with cold air and log PC20, but there was considerable scatter, the results of one test accounting for 25 percent of the variability in the other. Some scatter may have been related to the methods we used, but much was probably due to the patients themselves. Neither test should be used on an exclusive basis to make the diagnosis of asthma.\r"

Acute cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty need not be routinely performed in stable patients after tPA therapy, but should be considered in unstable patients. Two trials suggest that aggressive use of coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery before hospital discharge to preserve infarct artery patency and to prevent postinfarction ischemia is associated with an important improvement in long-term prognosis. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered standard care for patients whose ischemic chest pain lasts 20 min to at least 6 h in duration and who have an injury current on their ECG unless they are at increased risk for bleeding. The need for and timing of cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and surgical revascularization after AMI requires further evaluation.\r"

However, the confidence limits of these findings overlap, and no firm conclusions can be made from comparing trials enrolling different populations with different baseline characteristics and ancillary treatments such as angioplasty. There have been few \"head-to-head\" comparisons. These trials show that tPA achieves better lysis rates than streptokinase, but the theoretic advantage of fibrin specificity does not result in fewer adverse effects or greater preservation of LV function.

Of those with positive venograms, 72 (83%) had proximal DVT, and 15 (17%) had DVT limited to calf veins. Overall, 22% of patients with proximal DVT were eligible for thrombolytic therapy. The major exclusion criteria were: (1) recent trauma or surgery, (2) recent GI bleeding, and (3) history of a bleeding disorder. Thus, thrombolytic therapy could be given to approximately one-fifth of our patients with proximal DVT.\r"

In developing proposals for a clinical trial of Thrombolysis in Pulmonary Embolism (TIPE), investigators in the 44 clinical centers reviewed the 2,539 patients' medical charts for contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Overall, 1,345 (53.5%) patients surveyed in the TIPE clinical centers would have been acceptable for treatment with thrombolytic therapy, a proportion higher than generally anticipated. Risks of major blood loss were the most frequent contraindications to thrombolytic therapy and were found in 838 (33.3%) patients. Risks to the CNS were found to contraindicate thrombolytic therapy in 453 (17.9%) patients. Risks of bleeding into special compartments were found to contraindicate thrombolytic therapy in 76 (3.0%) patients. Pulmonary embolism is underdiagnosed in most clinical settings, and even more patients than found in the TIPE survey could benefit from appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The question remains as to whether pulmonary embolism patients will benefit from thrombolytic therapy. Only a randomized clinical trial will provide a satisfactory answer.\r"

Insulin secretion and whole-body insulin sensitivity (determined by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests with analysis by the minimal-model method) were unchanged by fenfluramine.

  ".W": "The binding properties of the gamma-emitting 125I-labeled 11 beta-methoxy analog of 16 alpha-iodoestradiol, 11 beta-methoxy-16 alpha-iodoestradiol (MIE2), were characterized for its use in vivo as a ligand for the measurement and localization of estrogen-binding sites. In binding displacement studies, MIE2 bound to rat, rabbit, and human estrogen receptors with high affinity. Association of MIE2 with uterine cytosol estrogen receptors reached maximum values within 30 min at 25 C. At 0-4 C, association was much slower, with maximum binding values not achieved until 16-24 h after the start of the incubation. Once formed, the MIE2-estrogen receptor complex was quite stable at 0-4 C (t1/2 much greater than 24 h). At 25 C, dissociation of MIE2-estrogen receptor complexes occurred nearly 3 times more slowly than that of E2-estrogen receptor complexes (t1/2, 3.3 vs. 1.2 h). The iodinated estrogen was highly specific for the estrogen receptor and did not bind appreciably to androgen, progestin, or glucocorticoid receptors or to either human sex hormone-binding globulin or rat alpha-fetoprotein. MIE2 is also not a ligand for human sex hormone-binding globulin. Dose-dependent uptake of [125I]MIE2 into pituitary and brain cell nuclei was observed after its in vivo administration to 25-day-old female rats. In 10-micron brain sections from immature female rats treated with [125I]MIE2 (7.5 microCi/g BW), regional localization of estrogen-sensitive brain areas could be obtained by autoradiography using LKB Ultrofilm with an exposure time of only 16 h. In comparison, after an identical dose of 16 alpha-[125I]iodoestradiol, an exposure time of 72 h was required to achieve an image of similar density. Combined autoradiographic and immunocytochemical studies in 5- to 11-day-old female rats demonstrated nuclear binding of [125I]MIE2 in cells immunoreactive for neurofilament protein but not glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicating that estrogen receptors in the developing postnatal brain are restricted to neurons and are not present in astroglial cells. The biological characteristics of [125I]MIE2 combined with its high specific activity make it an estrogenic probe with a wide range of possible uses for the study of estrogen action in the developing brain as well as other estrogen target tissues.\r"

Treatment with estradiol or progesterone alone had no effect on dopamine in portal plasma. The rate of synthesis of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), the precursor of dopamine, in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TID) neurites in the median eminence (ME) was 15 +/- 1.0 (mean +/- SE) pmol DOPA/ME.h in estradiol-progesterone-treated animals compared to 3.2 +/- 0.02 in vehicle-treated controls. Treatment with estradiol or progesterone alone gave a result similar to that seen in controls. In hypophysectomized animals treated with estradiol and progesterone, DOPA synthesis in the ME was greatly attenuated compared to that in intact rats. The in situ activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; expressed as moles of DOPA per mol TH/h) in the ME was 178 +/- 16.5 in estradiol-progesterone-treated intact rats, but was 27 +/- 2.4, 52 +/- 4.2, and 35 +/- 2.5 in animals treated with the solvent vehicle, estradiol, and progesterone, respectively. In hypophysectomized rats the in situ activity of TH in the ME of animals treated with estradiol and progesterone was 53 +/- 8.4, which was significantly (P less than 0.01) less than that in similarly treated intact animals. The circulating PRL level in vehicle-treated animals was 35 +/- 4.6 ng/ml compared to 121 +/- 16 in estradiol-treated animals and 133 +/- 12.2 in estradiol- and progesterone-treated rats, indicating that the difference in the effects of estradiol and estradiol-progesterone on dopamine release, DOPA synthesis, and in situ TH activity was not solely due to a difference in circulating PRL levels. Maintenance for 7 days of anterior pituitary tissue as a graft in a lateral ventricle of intact rats resulted in a 2-fold increase in the synthesis of DOPA and TH activity in the ME compared to that in animals with liver implants. Results obtained in hypophysectomized animals with implants were similar to those in intact animals. The concentrations of PRL in cerebrospinal fluid of intact rats and hypophysectomized rats with anterior pituitary implants in the lateral ventricles were 96 +/- 32 and 127 +/- 35 ng/ml, respectively, which was significantly (P less than 0.001) greater than those in animals with liver implants. We suggest that a factor of pituitary origin stimulates TH activity in TID neurons. This stimulation may be due to PRL, but the existence of another stimulatory substance secreted by pituitary cells cannot be excluded.\r"

Two protein bands, with mol wt of 43.5K and 46.5K, were radiolabeled by cholera toxin, while a single protein (41.5K mol wt) was ADP ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Northern hybridization of total RNA from Nb2 cells with specific cDNA probes indicated the presence of mRNA transcripts encoding Gs, Gi2, Go, and, to a lesser extent, Gi3. A characteristic of receptors coupled to G-proteins is that their binding properties are regulated by guanine nucleotides. The binding of [125I]human GH to the lactogen receptor as well as the binding of [125I]IL-2 to the IL-2 receptor were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by GTP, GDP, and the analog guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). GMP, however, had no effect. The addition of pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate to regenerate GTP from GDP greatly increased the apparent potency of GTP. Cholera toxin inhibited PRL- and interleukin-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in the Nb2 cells. In contrast, pertussis toxin had a differential effect on PRL- and IL-2-stimulated cells. Pertussis toxin, at an optimal concentration of 0.01 ng/ml, significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of PRL on DNA synthesis (P less than or equal to 0.01; n = 9) and cell proliferation (P less than or equal to 0.05; n = 9) compared with the effect of PRL alone. However, at higher concentrations the toxin inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Complete inhibition was achieved with 1000 ng/ml toxin. In contrast to the biphasic effect on PRL-stimulated cells, pertussis toxin was only weakly inhibitory to cells treated with IL-2. At the highest concentration tested, pertussis toxin (1000 ng/ml) inhibited IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis and cell growth by only 30-35%. (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) or methylxanthine (MIX; IC50 = 0.25 mM) also inhibited PRL-stimulated DNA synthesis. In the absence of mitogen, neither agent, from 0.0001-1 mM, had any effect on DNA synthesis. Similarly, IL-2-stimulated DNA synthesis in Nb2 cells was inhibited by (Bu)2cAMP (IC50 = 0.019 mM) or MIX (IC50 = 0.072 mM). However, MIX was approximately 3 times as potent in inhibiting the cell response to IL-2 as that to PRL. The susceptibility of Nb2 cells to both bacterial toxins suggests a role for G-proteins in regulating PRL- or IL-2-stimulated mitogenesis in these cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Inhibin subunit mRNA levels decline dramatically on the evening of proestrus in follicles of the ovulatory pool. Because this decline is temporally associated with primary gonadotropin surges, we investigated the contribution of LH and FSH to this process. The primary gonadotropin surges were blocked by injection of a GnRH antagonist (WY45760) at 1200 h on proestrus. This resulted in sustained elevation of inhibin mRNA levels through 0700 h of the subsequent day, a time when inhibin mRNA levels would normally be very low. Replacement of either exogenous LH or FSH in ovulatory doses to an antagonist-treated animal at 1530 h on proestrus resulted in a decrease in inhibin mRNA levels by 4-5 h postreplacement. We conclude that LH and FSH act via a common mechanism to repress inhibin mRNA levels in stimulated preovulatory follicles.\r"

In static incubation, activation of protein kinase-C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 1,2-dioctanoyl-rac-glycerol (diC8) resulted in an increase in GH release and a concurrent concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation. The GH response to diC8 in perifusion was reversible and repeatable. On the other hand, the GH response to PMA was not repeatable. The lack of repeatability is most likely due to the depletion of protein kinase-C by prolonged treatment with PMA. This assumption is strengthened by the observation that 1 h of perifusion with PMA left the somatotrophs refractory to a subsequent application of diC8. When graded pulses of GRF were applied during treatment with PMA, the GH response to GRF was not altered. Somatostatin reduced (in static incubation) or blocked (in perifusion) the release of GH induced by diC8 and PMA, but the accumulation of cAMP was not affected. We conclude that 1) activation of protein kinase-C in normal somatotrophs results in GH release which may not be completely independent of the cAMP pathway; 2) activation of protein kinase-C is not essential for GRF-induced GH release; and 3) SRIF acts at a site distal to or independent of cAMP to inhibit GH release induced by activators of protein kinase-C.\r"

  ".W": "Differentiation of granulosa cells and development of ovarian follicles requires FSH for several days. The purpose of the present studies was to determine how the capacity of the adenylyl cyclase of immature porcine granulosa cells to respond to FSH depends on the dose, duration, and frequency of exposure to FSH. Cells were stimulated with various regimens of FSH and forskolin in a dynamic flow perifusion system. cAMP production during 4 h of continuous (tonic) exposure to FSH was directly related to FSH concentration (5-500 ng/ml). FSH-stimulated cAMP production declined markedly after 4 h of tonic stimulation with FSH, regardless of the FSH concentration. Preliminary experiments using a pulse interval of 3 h (perifusion medium FSH concentration, 150 ng/ml) indicated that stimulation with 15-min pulses elicited a greater cumulative cAMP response than stimulation with either 5-, 30-, or 60-min pulses. Responsiveness to FSH depended critically on the duration and frequency of stimulation and the concentration of FSH. Short pulses were more effective than long pulses in both eliciting cAMP responses of most uniform amplitude and maintaining responsiveness to a final tonic FSH stimulus. The optimal pattern of stimulation consisted of a pulse duration of 15 min, with a pulse interval of 2-3 h. A peak chamber FSH concentration of 150 ng/ml yielded the greatest cumulative cAMP production, although cells that had been perifused with FSH-free medium had the greatest response to a final tonic FSH stimulus. The attenuation of responsiveness after continuous perifusion with FSH does not appear to be due to desensitization of the cyclase itself, since 1) cells perifused with FSH continuously for 20 h still responded to forskolin (100 microM), which activates cyclase independently of the FSH receptor; and 2) cells did not become refractory to forskolin for 14 h. The transient refractoriness to FSH appears to be due to a process that alters the interaction between the FSH receptor and the guanine nucleotide regulatory component of cyclase. This refractoriness can be reversed simply by removing FSH from the perifusion medium for a critical period of time, i.e. 2-3 h.\r"

Luteal cells were obtained from midcycle corpora lutea dispersed with collagenase and separated by flow cytometry into large and small cells. Resting levels of Ca2+ were higher (P less than 0.05) in the large than small cells [314 +/- 25 nM (n = 5) vs. 186 +/- 13 nM (mean +/- SE; n = 13) for large and small cells, respectively]. LH rapidly increased [Ca2+]i in both small and large cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ probe fura-2. In the small cells, [Ca2+]i was immediately increased 2- to 6-fold (from 176 +/- 8 to 468 +/- 8 nM; n = 5) after adding LH. The LH induced [Ca2+]i rise occurred in two phases: an initial peak due to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and a secondary rise due to Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources. Preincubation of the small cells with EGTA reduced the initial phase and abolished the secondary rise in [Ca2+]. Both forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP increased [Ca2+]i in the small cells. In contrast, only a single phase of [Ca2+]i rise was observed in LH-treated large cells, and the response was 1.5- to 2-fold greater than the resting Ca2+ levels [314 +/- 25 vs. 435 +/- 60 nM (n = 4), for resting vs. LH-treated values, respectively]. The addition of both LH and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) to the large cells resulted in increases in [Ca2+]i that were greater than those induced by each hormone separately (2.0-fold for LH and 2.7-fold for PGF2 alpha vs. 7- to 9-fold in the presence of both hormones). These findings demonstrate that LH induces rapid increases in intracellular [Ca2+]i that differ in magnitude and profile between the small and large bovine luteal cells. Furthermore, LH and PGF2 alpha interacted to promote increases in [Ca2+]i in the large cells, that were higher than the sum of [Ca2+]i induced by each hormone separately.\r"

The aims of this study were 1) to determine the effects of pituitary stalk section (SS), which prevents DA input from the TIDA neurons, on PRL release, and 2) to assess if the anterior pituitary receives any DA input after SS. Ovariectomized rats were subjected to SS or sham surgery. Jugular blood was collected on the day of surgery (day 0) and for 6 days thereafter and was analyzed for PRL by RIA. DA concentration in the posterior pituitary was determined by HPLC. Unexpectedly, SS caused only a 2- to 3-fold initial rise in plasma PRL on day 0. This was followed by a gradual rise to 4-, 6-, and 8-fold above control levels on days 2, 4, and 6, respectively, without a further increase by 2 weeks. During this time, DA concentrations in the posterior pituitary progressively declined to 66%, 28%, and 6% of control values on days 1, 2, and 6 after SS, respectively. In the second experiment, intact and SS rats were treated with the DA receptor antagonist haloperidol. Haloperidol induced a dramatic 30- to 40-fold increase in plasma PRL in intact rats. Haloperidol induced a 3-fold rise in plasma PRL on day 1 after SS and a transient 2.5-fold rise on day 2. On day 6 after SS, when DA in the posterior pituitary was barely detectable, haloperidol failed to increase PRL secretion. The DA agonist apomorphine caused similar inhibitions of PRL release on days 1 and 6 after SS. Injections of TRH stimulated PRL secretion equally well in intact and SS rats. We conclude that SS does not induce refractoriness to PRL secretagogues or a dysfunction of the anterior pituitary DA receptors. The immediate rise in PRL after SS is modest because the anterior pituitary still receives DA input from the posterior pituitary. A gradual exhaustion of posterior pituitary DA, caused by the disconnection of the THDA terminals from their perikarya, leads to the progressive rise in plasma PRL levels. The DA input affecting PRL release is derived exclusively from the TIDA and THDA neurons, but their relative contributions are yet unknown.\r"

  ".U": "89210515\r", 
  ".W": "Regularly menstruating female rhesus monkeys were implanted sc with Silastic tubing packed with estrone. The implants were replaced every 6-8 months to maintain the serum estrone and estradiol concentrations constantly elevated 1.5-2.5-fold, i.e. in the midfollicular phase range, for 4 yr. Increasing the estrone and estradiol concentrations initially led to anovulation which persisted for 6 to 15 months after which three of four of the estrogen-treated animals resumed ovulatory cycles. These animals then waxed and waned between anovulation and ovulatory cycles for the remainder of the study period. The resumption of ovulatory cycles were attributed to an escape of the central nervous system-pituitary axis from the suppressive effect of the elevated estrogen concentrations, since serum estradiol concentrations did not change. During anovulatory and ovulatory months the basal LH concentration was not significantly increased in the estrogen-treated monkeys compared to the control animals, but it was significantly reduced during anovulatory months compared to ovulatory months. Furthermore, LH secretion in response to a bolus of GnRH was attenuated in the monkeys chronically exposed to the acyclic elevation of blood estrogen levels. As the sensitivity to estrogen decreased, sufficient basal concentrations of FSH and LH were achieved to support ovulatory cycles with associated midcycle surges of LH and FSH secretion and apparently normal luteal patterns of progesterone secretion. Since the daily FSH concentrations of these ovulatory cycles of the estrone-treated animals were significantly lower than that of ovulatory cycles of the control monkeys, the ovulatory cycles of the estrogen animals may not have been normal, but this was not directly documented. These studies suggest that elevated basal estrogen levels do not lead to elevated basal LH secretion in the female primate; and also in the intact adult primate the central nervous system-pituitary axis has the potential to change its sensitivity to the negative feedback effects of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is present in nerve fibers within atrial tissue, raising the possibility that CGRP release may influence atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion. We, therefore, examined the effect of CGRP on immunoreactive ANP (ANP-IR) secretion. Isolated rat left atria paced at 2 Hz were superfused with 0.1 microM CGRP. A biphasic 2-fold increase in ANP-IR secretion occurred in response to CGRP. We next examined the mechanism of CGRP-stimulated secretion. The biphasic ANP-IR secretory response to CGRP was similar to that induced by superfusion with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and (Bu)2cAMP, but distinct from that of the non-cAMP dependent stimuli phenylephrine, ouabain, and Bay K 8644. Superfusion with 0.1 microM CGRP for 4 min with 100 microM isobutylmethylxanthine increased atrial cAMP content from 4.29 +/- 1.21 to 10.32 +/- 2.14 pmol/mg atrial weight (P less than 0.001). Atria were next superfused with methacholine, an inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase activation. The addition of 0.1 microM isoproterenol or 0.1 microM CGRP to the superfusate containing 10 microM methacholine failed to stimulate ANP-IR secretion and lowered cAMP accumulation by 70%. Superfusion with 10 microM atropine negated the inhibitory effects of methacholine. We conclude that 1) CGRP stimulates ANP-IR secretion in vitro; and 2) CGRP-stimulated secretion appears to be mediated by cAMP. Thus, ANP-IR secretion may be modulated by atrial nerve fibers containing CGRP in vivo.\r"

Intraperitoneal injection of several GnRH peptides, including a form native to goldfish, salmon GnRH (sGnRH), elevated circulating GH levels in female goldfish. An analog of mammalian GnRH (mGnRH), [D-Ala6,Pro9-NEt] mGnRH (mGnRH-A), at a dosage of 0.1 microgram/g BW increased serum GH levels for up to 48 h after a single ip injection. Goldfish receiving a series of injections of this dose of mGnRH-A also displayed an increased rate of body growth, indicating that the mGnRH-A-induced increase in the circulating GH level was sufficient to accelerate body growth. In vitro experiments using perifused pituitary fragments found that sGnRH stimulated the secretion of GH from the goldfish pituitary in a potent, dose-dependent, and reversible manner. The time course of response and half-maximally effective dose of sGnRH were very similar for both GH and gonadotropin (GTH) secretion in vitro, suggesting that the mechanism(s) mediating the stimulatory actions of GnRH in the goldfish may be similar for both GH and GTH secretion. However, GnRH-induced GH and GTH secretion from the goldfish pituitary can occur independently of each other, as demonstrated by the finding that somatostatin inhibited the GnRH stimulation of GH secretion in vitro, without influencing the GTH response, whereas the dopamine agonist apomorphine inhibited GnRH-induced GTH secretion in vitro, without influencing the GH response. Furthermore, the dopamine antagonist pimozide did not influence serum GH levels, although pimozide potentiated the stimulatory effect of GnRH on GTH secretion in vivo by blocking the endogenous GTH release inhibitory action of dopamine. Results of the present study suggest that the secretion of GH and GTH in the goldfish are regulated, at least in part, through a common releasing factor, GnRH, whereas somatostatin and dopamine appear to act independently as GH and GTH release inhibitory factors, respectively.\r"

The effect of L-lysine differed from that of the other cationic amino acids by such features as the absence of a threshold concentration for stimulation of insulin release, a much lesser sensitivity of the secretory response to intracellular acidification, and the stimulation of 86Rb net uptake over 60 min of incubation. This coincided with the fact that even in the absence of another exogenous nutrient, L-lysine was well oxidized, augmented NH4+ production, increased both the ATP content and ATP/ADP ratio, caused a time-related decrease in 86Rb fractional outflow, and provoked either a transient (10 mM L-lysine) or sustained (20 mM L-lysine) stimulation of insulin secretion. It is proposed, therefore, that the functional response of the pancreatic B-cell to L-lysine involves not only a biophysical mechanism similar to that responsible for the insulinotropic action of L-homoarginine, but also a significant, albeit modest, metabolic component, which reflects the capacity of L-lysine to act as a fuel in islet cells.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of granulosa cells can be stimulated to produce large amounts of progesterone by gonadotropins. This stimulation is associated with significant changes in the expression of several major proteins, as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. These changes include a decrease in the synthesis of actin cytoskeleton proteins and an increase in the synthesis of a few abundant proteins, one of which is a mammalian heat shock protein, hsp90. Under culture conditions that have previously been shown to bring about the maturation of granulosa cells into progesterone-producing cells (i.e. treatment with gonadotropins or cAMP or by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin), an increased synthesis of hsp90 could be demonstrated. Freshly isolated granulosa cells isolated from PMSG-treated animals synthesize hsp90 at a much higher level than cells isolated from diethylstilbestrol-treated rats. Kinetic studies have shown that granulosa cells isolated from diethylstilbestrol- or PMSG-treated rats synthesize high levels of hsp90 if maintained in culture in the presence of gonadotropins, but rapidly decrease hsp90 synthesis in the absence of gonadotropins and increase the synthesis of actin cytoskeleton proteins. Furthermore, in cells cultured for 48 h in the presence of cytochalasin-B followed by incubation for 24 h in the absence of the drug, the synthesis of hsp90 and several other proteins characteristic of mature granulosa cells decreased, while that of the actin cytoskeleton increased. In vitro translation assays and Northern blot analyses suggest that hsp90 synthesis in gonadotropin-stimulated cells may be regulated by mRNA translational efficiency. Taken together with recent findings in which hsp90 was identified in complex with cytoplasmic steroid receptors and the hormonal regulation of hsp90 content in target tissues, the results support the notion that hsp90 plays a role in the control of steroid hormone action.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of vasopressin in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion, the plasma, atrial, ventricular, and hypothalamic levels of ANP were measured in Long-Evans (LE) and vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro (DI) rats. Total atrial immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) as well as right auricular IR-ANP concentration were higher in the DI than in the LE rats, whereas no significant difference was noted in left auricular IR-ANP concentration. In the left ventricle of DI rats, the IR-ANP concentration was 82% greater than that in the LE rats, while no substantial difference was found in the right ventricular IR-ANP concentration between the strains. Normal LE rats had low levels of left ventricular ANP mRNA and barely detectable ANP mRNA in the right ventricle, DI rats showed a 3-fold greater ANP mRNA concentration in the left ventricle than age-matched LE controls, and ANP mRNA levels were also increased in the left auricle of DI rats. The hypothalamic IR-ANP content, but not the concentration, was significantly increased in the DI compared to the LE rats. Despite increased cardiac IR-ANP and ANP mRNA levels, plasma IR-ANP concentrations were similar in the conscious DI rats (97 +/- 9 pg/ml; n = 13) and the LE rats (95 +/- 8 pg/ml; n = 15). Volume expansion (1.1 ml/100 g BW of 0.9% saline, iv) increased right atrial pressure and caused a significant rise in plasma IR-ANP in both strains (P less than 0.01). Elevations of plasma IR-ANP concentrations caused by volume loading were comparable in LE and DI rats in either the absence or presence of exogenous vasopressin (5 ng/kg.min, iv), which, when infused alone, did not significantly influence the plasma IR-ANP concentration. However, the relation between the change in IR-ANP concentration and the change in right atrial pressure shifted to the left, and thus, for a given increase in right atrial pressure, a greater amount of IR-ANP was released in the vasopressin-treated rats than in the control animals. These results demonstrate that although acute volume expansion does not necessarily require endogenous vasopressin for the ANP secretory response, vasopressin increased the ability of volume expansion to induce ANP release, thus modulating the direct mechanical stimulus-induced ANP secretion. The increased left ventricular levels of immunoreactive ANP and augmentation of ANP mRNA levels in Brattleboro rats despite normal left ventricular weight to body weight ratio show that increased ANP gene expression may occur in the ventricles independently of hypertrophy.\r"

  ".U": "89210546\r", 
  ".W": "The present work characterizes galanin receptors in the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell line Rin m 5F and documents their regulation by guanine nucleotides. Binding of [125I]galanin to cell membranes was found to be temperature dependent, rapid, saturable, reversible, and highly peptide specific. Optimal steady state conditions were achieved after a 60-min incubation at 15 C. The concentration dependence of galanin binding determined by adding increasing concentrations of [125I]galanin indicated that galanin receptors were saturated at 2-3 nM peptide. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of receptors, with a Kd of 0.3 nM and a binding capacity of 82 fmol/mg protein. Guanyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate dramatically enhanced the dissociation of bound [125I]galanin. Some guanine nucleotides inhibited [125I]galanin binding to membranes with the following order of potency: guanyl 5'-yl imidodiphosphate greater than GTP = GDP. Other nucleotides had no effect. The effect of the guanine nucleotides was Mg2+ dependent, but Na+ independent, although Mg2+ ions alone (5 mM) slightly enhanced [125I]galanin binding, and Na+ ions alone (100 mM) induced a 60% decrease in the binding. Finally, overnight treatment of Rin m 5F cells with pertussis toxin (0.4 microgram/ml) dramatically reduced [125I]galanin binding to cell membranes. This was related to a 4-fold decrease in receptor affinity, with no change in binding capacity. In conclusion, for the first time evidence of the existence of galanin receptors on functional pancreatic beta-cells is presented. Also, other findings support the fact that galanin receptors are functionally associated with a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein mediating guanine nucleotide control of galanin binding.\r"

Response to treatment was assessed by urinary estrogen excretion and ultrasound measurement of follicular growth. Ten patients ovulated and 8 subsequently conceived, for a total of 10 pregnancies. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was not administered routinely, but two patients required hCG to induce follicular rupture. The majority of the patients who conceived had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 21 and a luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio of less than 1. Conversely, those patients with either elevated BMI or LH or both generally failed to respond satisfactorily to this treatment. It is suggested that pulsatile GnRH is most likely to succeed in inducing ovulation if the BMI is less than 21 and the LH is normal, but is unlikely to be successful if there is both an elevated LH and a BMI of greater than 25. Between these two extremes, the response is variable and a therapeutic trial may be appropriate.\r"

In spite of these findings there are no controlled studies that have attempted to evaluate methods for improving adherence to drug regimens for the treatment of chronic headache disorders. In an initial effort to address this adherence problem thirty-four recurrent migraine sufferers were randomized to abortive therapy with ergotamine tartrate plus caffeine (standard abortive therapy) or to standard abortive therapy accompanied by a brief educational intervention designed to facilitate the migraine sufferer's effective use of ergotamine. Patients who received the adjunctive educational intervention attempted to abort a greater percentage of their migraine attacks (70% vs 40%) and showed larger reduction in headache activity (e.g., 40% vs 26% reduction in month two of treatment). However, patients in both treatment groups used similar amounts of abortive medication when attempting to abort a migraine attack and showed similar reductions in analgesic medication use with abortive therapy. There results suggest that brief educational interventions designed to address the problem of patient adherence may yield significant improvements in standard therapies. We argue that such educational interventions deserve more attention in the headache treatment literature than they have received to date.\r"

  ".W": "To study the metabolic and functional changes that occur during training with inspiratory flow resistive loads, a chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep preparation was used. Sheep were exposed to resistances ranging from 50 to 100 cmH2O.l-1.s, for 2-4 h/day, 5-6 days/wk, for a total of 3 wk. Load intensity was adjusted to maintain arterial Po2 (PaO2) above 60 Torr and arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) below 45 Torr. Training produced significant (P less than 0.05) increases in citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and cytochrome oxidase in the costal and crural diaphragm of the trained sheep (n = 9) compared with control sheep (n = 7). Phosphofructokinase did not increase. In the quadriceps, citrate synthase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and phosphofructokinase did not change with training but cytochrome oxidase increased significantly (P less than 0.01). Function of the diaphragm was assessed in a subset of five sheep exposed to the same severe load 1 wk before and 2 days after the final training session. After training, sheep had a lower PaCO2 (10-40%), generated a higher transdiaphragmatic pressure (20-40%), and could sustain this level of transdiaphragmatic pressure for 0.5-2 h longer. The respiratory duty cycle was 10-15% lower, whereas minute ventilation and tidal volume were 20-30% higher in the posttraining test. We conclude that 1) training with inspiratory flow resistive loads improves the performance of the respiratory neuromuscular system and 2) the shift in enzyme profile of the diaphragm is at least in part responsible for this improvement.\r"
