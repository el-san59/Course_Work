In the skin, Langerhans cell numbers were reduced in CRF, CAPD and HD patients but in the cervix, Langerhans cells were reduced only in the CRF patients. There was a preponderance of T suppressor lymphocytes compared with T helper lymphocytes in the epidermis in the CRF and the CAPD groups. The presence of natural killer cells in the epidermis of the renal groups compared to controls was significant in the CRF and HD patients while the presence of T suppressor lymphocytes in the epidermis compared to controls was significant only in the CAPD patients. In the dermis, there was a mixed cellular infiltrate of T helper and T suppressor lymphocytes but with no subset attaining significance. The dermal infiltrate of T helper lymphocytes in all three groups of renal patients was significantly reduced compared to controls. In CRF patients, peripheral blood pan T cells, T helper and T suppressor lymphocytes and B lymphocytes were reduced, while T suppressor lymphocytes were reduced in both HD and CAPD patients, compared to controls. Though the results confirm alteration of the immunocytology of the skin, cervix and peripheral blood, we could not relate them to a clinical finding.\r"

On previously untanned areas, all those subjects on active treatment developed a mild tan; in tanned areas they all developed a moderate tan, while all control subjects developed a minimal to mild tan. The mean protection factor against later UVB-induced erythema was 3.2 +/- 0.3 after the active course and 1.6 +/- 0.2 among the controls. Significantly more frequent adverse cutaneous effects for active subjects were pruritus, erythema, freckling, burning sensation, dryness and polymorphic light eruption. Cutaneous Langerhans cell numbers, and blood CD3+ (pan T-cell) and CD4+ (helper T-cell) lymphocyte subsets were reduced in both active and control groups. CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor T-cell) counts were similarly but not significantly reduced in both groups. Pityrosporum yeast counts were significantly reduced in both groups. The changes found in both groups seem attributable to small amounts of UVB emission from both active and control lamps.\r"

In 10 out of 13 patients the majority of the lymphocytes expressed the phenotype of suppressor cells. The number of Leu 8+ cells was inversely proportional to HLA-DR expression by the dermal infiltrate, which suggested a negative correlation between a state of activation and the concentration of Leu 8+ cells.

Fourteen young male subjects entered the study (eight Caucasians, six Blacks). Reactive hyperaemia was recorded after 4 min of occlusion of the forearm blood flow. The following parameters of the hyperaemic reaction were investigated: area under the curve response, peak response, rise of blood flow slope to peak and decay of blood flow slope after peak. Different responses were recorded in the Black subjects after the vasoconstrictive stimulus compared to the Caucasians, namely: decreased area under the curve response (P less than 0.04); decreased peak response (P less than 0.01); decreased decay slope after peak blood flow (P less than 0.04). These data are consistent with a different reactivity of blood vessels in black skin and possibly not related to the transcutaneous penetration of the chemical compound.\r"

Comparison of the HIV antibody positive group with the HIV antibody negative group and with non-haemophiliac controls showed an increased prevalence of four HIV-associated dermatoses: 11 patients had seborrhoeic dermatitis (10 HIV antibody positive and one HIV antibody negative (P less than 0.05 chi 2 test], eight patients had folliculitis (six HIV antibody positive), four patients had mucocutaneous candidiasis, all were HIV antibody positive, and three patients had onychomycosis, all were HIV antibody positive. None of these conditions was seen in a group of 16 non-haemophiliac controls. These findings are different from those reported from a similar study of comparable groups of homosexual men and these results may be further evidence to support the belief that the behaviour of HIV infection differs between haemophiliacs and other risk groups.\r"

Our results show that UV light increases skin-oxygen tension of the lower leg and inhibits the normal vasoconstrictor response on standing. However, this effect is short lived and is followed after 2 days by a return of the vasoconstrictor reflex and a marked decrease in skin oxygenation which continues for at least 2 weeks. Since UV irradiation improves skin oxygenation for only 48 h, it cannot be recommended as a form of treatment for venous leg ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "At concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml and greater, dithranol (anthralin) caused an intense, dose-related activation of luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (LECL) of human neutrophils and also increased oxygen consumption by these cells. Activation of LECL, which was maximal with 40 micrograms/ml dithranol, occurred promptly, peaked at 3-5 min, then declined. Dithranol-mediated stimulation of LECL was inhibited by catalase and by the protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7. Neutrophils from individuals with chronic granulomatous disease were unresponsive to the pro-oxidative effects of dithranol. At concentrations of 2.5 micrograms/ml and less, dithranol did not directly activate the LECL responses of neutrophils. However pre-treatment of neutrophils with dithranol at concentrations of 0.5-2.5 micrograms/ml increased the LECL-responses of cells subsequently stimulated with calcium ionophore and opsonized zymosan. These observations demonstrate two distinct dose-related, pro-oxidative interactions of dithranol with human neutrophils: low-dose priming and high-dose activation of oxidant generation. Since phagocyte-derived reactive oxidants are immunosuppressive, these pro-oxidative interactions of dithranol with human neutrophils may contribute to the pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms of this agent.\r"

It has been claimed that standard labelling with either anti-HLA-DR or OKT6 antibodies alone may fail to identify potentially important subsets of LCs with the phenotypes HLA-DR+CD1- and HLA-DR-CD1+. We report here on flow cytometric analysis of suction blister-derived normal epidermal cell (EC) suspensions, double stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-HLA-DR and fluoresceinated OKT6. In seven separate experiments, no evidence for the existence of either HLA-DR+CDI- or HLA-DR-CDI+ ECs was obtained. We found that HLA-DR+CDI+LCs, which constituted a mean of 2.5% (+/- 0.3 SEM) of all ECs, could be readily identified on the basis of fluorescence, and that their light scatter characteristics were those of moderately sized cells of low granularity. We further describe our method for flow cytometric enrichment of such HLA-DR+CDi+ LCs for functional studies, based on selection on both fluorescence and light scatter criteria. Enrichment is to greater than 90% purity, and the method is applicable to the small number of ECs (approximately 1 x 10(6] obtained from a suction blister.\r"

The cells showed morphological changes consisting mainly of loss of dendritic processes. Twenty-four controls (age, sex and race matched) had a mean number of LC of 632 +/- 138. In tuberculoid patients (TT) significant differences were observed, depending on the site of biopsy. Nine biopsies from involved skin had 993 +/- 206 LC, whereas 11 from healthy skin had 448 +/- 96 (P less than 0.001). This difference was confirmed in six additional borderline tuberculoid (BT) and TT patients in whom biopsies were simultaneously obtained from involved (973 +/- 179) and uninvolved skin (498 +/- 99). In 10 patients with indeterminate leprosy the LC density did not differ from the control population (630 +/- 261). The expression of LC numbers in BT and TT patients may represent migration of these cells from healthy skin to involved areas or mobilization of a central pool. The low density found in LL patients could interfere with adequate presentation of mycobacterial antigens leading to tolerance. Alternatively the presence of T helper cells in TT infiltrates may produce factors that recruit LC; their absence in LL lesions may account for the decrease in LC expression.\r"

  ".W": "Contact allergy to topical corticosteroids occurs more frequently than previously supposed. Cross-allergic phenomena are common. On the basis of a review of the literature and our own patch test data on 15 patients, we conclude that positive patchtests to corticosteroids occur approximately six to seven times more frequently in well-defined groups of structurally-related substances than between corticosteroids of different groups. An analogous substitution pattern on the steroid D-ring or the carbon side chain (C20, C21) seems to have a significant influence on the association of positive patchtest results. This is not the case for other structural variables, such as the presence of a double bond in the steroid A-ring or fluoride substitutions on the B-ring. The effect of other factors such as concomitant sensitization and steroid metabolism in the skin on the development of a corticosteroid polyallergy are analysed, and the specificity and sensitivity of cross-allergy phenomena are evaluated. These are important in the selection of a topical steroid in the future treatment of a corticosteroid sensitive patient.\r"

The lipid peroxide content in the skin and subcutaneous tissue was markedly increased as compared with that of control rats on a normal diet. The lipid peroxide content in the tissues of rats deficient in vitamin E for 3 months, was greater than that found in those on the diet for 6 months. The effect of UV irradiation on the lipid peroxide content in the skin of control rats was not significant, but there was a marked difference in lipid peroxide content in those animals on a deficient diet. The amount of insoluble collagen in the skin of rats on a vitamin E deficient diet for 6 months was increased and by more than in those animals on the diet for 3 months. The amount of soluble collagen in the rats deficient in vitamin E for 6 months was markedly reduced when compared with those on the diet for 3 months. These results suggest that vitamin E deficiency promotes the peroxidation of lipids and accelerates the cross-linking of collagen in the skin.\r"

Amongst the topical clindamycin-treated patients, there was a higher incidence of EmR propionibacterial carriage in those patients who had previously been treated with oral erythromycin (64%) than in patients with no known previous exposure to erythromycin (20%; 0.01 greater than P greater than 0.001). Patients responding to oral erythromycin treatment carried EmR propionibacteria less frequently (24%) than patients who were not responding or who had relapsed (70%; P less than 0.001). These observations suggest that the use of oral erythromycin and/or topical clindamycin encourages the development of resistant propionibacteria and that the emergence of resistant strains is associated with therapeutic failure in erythromycin-treated patients. In total 63 resistant isolates were obtained from 52 subjects. There were 42 strains of Propionibacterium acnes, 16 strains of Propionibacterium granulosum and five strains of Propionibacterium avidum. The majority of isolates were inducibly or constitutively resistant to macrolide (e.g. erythromycin), lincosamide (e.g. clindamycin) and streptogramin B type antibiotics. Therefore, the isolates are phenotypically indistinguishable from the majority of EmR bacteria in which resistance is due to methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA.\r"

Levels of IFN were measured in serum samples from 22 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 12 patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) before and 24 h after dipyridamole administration. IFN activity was assayed on human and bovine cells in parallel. Initial serum concentrations of alpha-IFN in SLE patients were markedly elevated. The percentage of DLE positive responders to dipyridamole induction was about twice as high as that found for SLE. Studies of factors responsible for IFN production in lupus erythematosus might result in better understanding of the relationship between DLE and SLE.\r"

Significantly better clinical improvement was seen in superficial radiotherapy treated hands over topical PUVA treated hands after 6 weeks of treatment, but this difference was not maintained at 9 or 18 weeks. There was no significant difference in symptom severity between the two treatments after 6 weeks, but superficial radiotherapy produced significantly more symptomatic improvement at 9 and 18 weeks.

Although most children had only mild flexural dermatitis, 71% had had significant alterations made to their diet before attendance at hospital. Almost all diets were unsupervised and only six children had seen a dietitian. Over half had been started on diets before any professional advice had been sought. Information on diet had come from media, books or magazines (51%), friends (32%), general practitioners (27%) and district nurses or health visitors (18%). The major dietary alterations included the exclusion of eggs, dairy products and food additives, and the use of soya and goat's milk. Under 10% of patients claimed benefit from these largely unsupervised diets. Harmful practices included the frequent use of unboiled, unpasteurized goat's milk, unmodified goat's milk in a baby of 4 months and the use of severely restricted diets. Three children (6%) in the diet group had been on diets which were considered by a hospital dietitian to be particularly dangerous. However, there was no evidence of growth retardation, failure to thrive or specific deficiency syndromes in the group we studied. Uncontrolled, unsupervised and often prolonged dietary alterations are commonplace in children with atopic dermatitis. This is a potentially serious health problem.\r"

Only 128 (11%) of the respondents believed that greater than or equal to 10% of ovarian cancers in the UK could be prevented by prophylactic oophorectomy at the time of operation for benign disease, and 505 (44%) would perform prophylactic oophorectomy as a primary surgical procedure in women who had a strong family history of ovarian cancer.\r"

Younger women (aged less than 35 or less than 45) have a better prognosis mainly because more present with earlier disease. Stage for stage there has been no change in survival of women of all ages treated by identical radiotherapy during this period. The rise in mortality of younger patients from carcinoma of cervix may be due to the increased incidence of the condition rather than a more virulent form of the disease.\r"

Neither the peptido-leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) nor LTB4 had any consistent effect, stimulatory or inhibitory, on human pregnant or non-pregnant myometrium, at doses up to 1.25 microM; nor did they have any effect in rat non-pregnant myometrium. As expected, PGE2, PGF2 alpha (0.3 microM) and oxytocin (5 nM) stimulated human pregnant myometrium. PGF2 alpha stimulated and PGE2 inhibited human non-pregnant myometrium but oxytocin had no effect; all three compounds stimulated rat non-pregnant myometrium. The binding of 3H-LTC4 to human myometrium was specific (LTC4 greater than LTD4 much greater than LTE4, LTB4, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, arachidonic acid) but of low affinity compared with the binding of 3H-PGE2 to the same membrane preparations.

The results of a series of log intensity-amplitude studies in a group of young affected Abyssinian cats were fitted to the Naka-Rushton relationship by means of a mathematical package on the University of London mainframe. The analysis showed that the amplitude of the maximum dark-adapted b-wave was significantly reduced by the end of the period studied but that the value of k, a variable inversely equivalent to retinal sensitivity, was only slightly reduced by the retinal degenerative process. The electrophysiological findings thus are similar to those found in cases of human diffuse dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa.\r"

Active trachoma was common among preschool children; over half had moderate to severe disease. Of residents 25 years old 90% had substantial conjunctival scarring. Severe conjunctival scarring was commoner among women (84%) than men (58%), and three-quarters of older women had trichiasis/entropion compared with 57% of older men. Males and females had equivalent age specific rates of inflammatory disease. Blindness was associated with old age; 17% of residents aged 50 and over were blind. Estimates of blindness based on this survey and other surveys in Egypt indicate that blindness is still a serious public health problem in rural Egypt. The number of blind persons in Egypt will increase from an estimated 420,000 in 1980 to 868,000 by the year 2020. The current crude blindness rate of 1.8% is expected to increase to 2.3% in the year 2000 and to 3.2% in 2020.\r"

The method, which uses X rays rather than gamma rays as its photon source, represents a significant improvement over present systems both in image quality and precision (reproducibility) of results, which is better than 1% in vivo. Scanning time is approximately halved compared with present techniques and the radiation dose is reduced by 25%. First data on long-term drift of results and effects of changes in patient composition (i.e. thickness and fat content) are given and show the new method to be superior to present radionuclide systems. It is likely that this new method will become the standard for bone density measurements.\r"

The results of 77 out of 642 (12%) with histologically verified lesions are presented. The sites of the lesions were as follows: head and neck 25 (32%), upper limbs 38 (49%), lower limbs 13 (17%) and trunk one case only. The histological diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma 48 (62%), basal cell carcinoma in 22 (29%) and other in seven (9%). There were nine out of 77 (12%) failures, four with persistent disease, which did not clear after initial treatment (and for whom the radon mould was an inappropriate choice of technique), and five (6%) recurrences after clearance of the initial lesion. There was a sharp rise in failures after 1979 when there was a change of radon supplier, but no calibration error was substantiated. It is clearly beneficial for institutions to cross-check the manufacturer's brachytherapy source data. There have been no further recurrences or any symptomatic late morbidity. This is a safe, effective and practical radiotherapeutic technique for superficial lesions (not exceeding a depth of 4 mm) in areas of poor radiation tolerance, and may obviate the need for a prolonged fractionated course of external-beam radiation in selected patients. Alternatives to radon are discussed.\r"

Subsidiary objectives were to obtain some information regarding the specification limits of the system and its components, as well as some quantitative estimate of its advantages for clinical diagnosis. The system was used to process a set of film radiographs of an anthropomorphic chest phantom, produced under conditions that were designed to provide a wide range of image qualities. Following this, four sets of randomly ordered processed and unprocessed images were formally assessed by a group of experienced observers. Consensus opinion from the group indicated that significant improvement could be obtained through simple image processing. Some radiographs regarded as unacceptable became, after processing, acceptable to viewers.\r"

There was an apparent increase in the proportion of proximal lesions with a decrease in the proportion of distal, antral cancers. The stage of disease at diagnosis remained constant with 79 per cent of patients having stage IV disease. Less than 1 per cent presented with stage I disease. As a result, the curative resection rate was 21 per cent. The operative mortality rates for curative partial gastrectomy and total gastrectomy were 13 and 29 per cent respectively. Surgeons undertaking more than nine total gastrectomies annually had an overall mean operative mortality rate of 22 per cent. Overall age-adjusted survival at 5 years was 5 per cent. Survival at 5 years for stage I, II and III disease was 72, 32 and 10 per cent respectively. There was a significant increase in survival time for those treated by curative resection between 1972 and 1981 compared with the previous decade. The implications for the management of gastric cancer are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The portal vein contributes little to the blood supply of established liver metastases in the presence of a patent hepatic artery. However, its role in the perfusion of early metastatic liver disease remains controversial. We have quantified the relative contribution of the portal vein and hepatic artery to the internal circulation of small liver tumours. These studies were conducted in a new rat model of liver metastases generated by the intraportal injection of cultured tumour spheroids. A total of 633 lesions were studied in 18 animals using radioisotope tracer microspheres. Nodules ranged from 0.5 to 6.0 mm in diameter, 92 per cent being 3.0 mm or less. The ratio of radioactivity in tumour compared with normal tissue (T:N ratio) was determined after simultaneously injecting microspheres into the portal and arterial circulation of each animal. The mean hepatic artery T:N ratio was significantly greater than that of the portal vein for all tumour sizes studied (P less than 0.01). Nodules 0.5 mm in diameter had a mean (s.e.m.) hepatic artery T:N ratio of 1.50 (0.12) in comparison with a mean portal vein ratio of 0.13 (0.04). Tumour nodules 2.0 mm in diameter had a mean (s.e.m.) hepatic artery T:N ratio of 1.26 (0.11) in comparison with a mean portal vein ratio of 0.06 (0.01). The overall T:N ratio for both routes decreased with increasing tumour size. These results indicate that hepatic tumours as small as 0.5 mm already have an established internal vasculature perfused predominantly by the hepatic artery. In contrast, the portal vein contributes insignificantly to the internal perfusion of these lesions. These results have significant implications for adjuvant locoregional therapy in gastrointestinal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "An analysis was carried out of 43 patients treated by omental transposition for locoregional problems associated with breast cancer. Indications for surgery included advanced primary tumour (five), locally recurrent tumour (32), radiation induced sarcoma (two), and radionecrosis (four). Tumours were typically extensive (mean diameter 7.2 cm) and skin ulceration affected 30 patients. Other treatment modalities had been exhausted. Surgical excision followed by reconstruction using transposed omentum resulted in worthwhile local control and symptom relief in 31 patients (median duration 22 months). Chest wall disease rapidly recurred peripheral to the omental graft in 12 patients. On multiple regression analysis, duration of local control was significantly related to tumour diameter, ulceration, and earlier radioresistance (hazard ratios 15.8, 3.8 and 14.8 respectively). Survival (median 21, range from 1.5 to 122 months) correlated with tumour size, previous chemotherapy, and early re-recurrence (hazard ratios 7.2, 3.0 and 4.3). Omental transfer is a reliable method of restoring epithelial cover after radical surgery and is particularly useful after previous irradiation injury. In advanced and recurrent breast cancer, an aggressive surgical approach significantly improved the quality of life of most patients, but careful case selection is required to avoid inappropriate surgery for irremediable tumours.\r"

Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered to those in whom the sample revealed axillary nodal metastasis (28 women) but not to those with no axillary nodal metastasis (26 women). A subjective assessment of the state of the arm was made using a standard questionnaire. Objective assessment included upper and forearm circumference, should joint mobility and assessment of power in the pectoralis muscle. The mean age was 56.8 years (range 33-77 years) and the mean elapsed time from treatment was 5.72 years (range 4.0-7.5 years). Subjective limb oedema was greatest in those who had axillary lymph node metastasis but there was no objective difference. Subjective joint mobility was reduced in the women who received radiotherapy and this was confirmed by objective assessment (P less than 0.05). The objective reduction in arm mobility was related to the treatment rather than the axillary lymph node status. There was no difference in power. In this study women receiving adjuvant radiotherapy had significantly reduced shoulder mobility. This may have implications for current conservation studies using adjuvant radiotherapy.\r"

Four patients (1.7 per cent) occluded their grafts within 30 days of surgery, while 25 (10.4 per cent) suffered late graft occlusion. Postoperative occlusions were associated with significant morbidity and only one patient avoided major limb amputation or death. Overall, 46 episodes of graft thrombosis involving 51 graft limbs were encountered, the most common underlying cause being pre-existing or progressive multilevel distal occlusive disease. The overall cumulative graft patency rates were 95 and 87 per cent at 1 and 5 years respectively. Cumulative 5-year patency was significantly higher in patients presenting with claudication (91 per cent) than in patients presenting with rest pain (77 per cent) or ulceration and/or gangrene (71 per cent). Patients with evidence of multilevel distal occlusive disease at the time of aortic surgery had a significantly higher incidence of occlusion compared with those in whom there was no significant distal disease. In 35 episodes of occlusion (76 per cent), surgery was undertaken to restore limb blood flow, being successful in all but one case, with the most commonly performed procedure being graft limb thrombectomy. Seven of 28 patients (25 per cent) ultimately required major limb amputation and three patients died as a direct consequence of graft thrombosis.\r"

This study was designed to develop a method of assessing venous elasticity, and to use this method to investigate the aetiology of varicose veins. Simultaneous measurements of calf volume (determined using strain gauge plethysmography) and venous pressure (obtained via a dorsal foot vein) were made during venous occlusion plethysmography. The elastic modulus, K, defined as stress/strain when the veins are full, was calculated from the pressure/volume relationship. The elastic modulus was determined in 19 normal legs, 33 legs with superficial venous insufficiency, 16 legs with deep venous insufficiency, and 18 legs of a high risk group of volunteers or patients without varicose veins but with a strong history of factors associated with their development. The results showed a clear difference in elasticity between normal limbs and limbs with varicose veins, and also between normal limbs and high risk limbs. These results support the hypothesis that reduced elasticity has a role in the development of varicose veins and precedes the onset of valvular incompetence.\r"

Sixty-five limbs in 48 patients with varicose veins who were found to have incompetent thigh perforating veins on ascending deep to superficial venography were studied. In 80 per cent of patients one incompetent thigh perforating vein was found and in 20 per cent more than one was found. Concomitant incompetent calf perforating veins were found in 92 per cent of the limbs studied. The incompetent thigh perforating veins were found to occur anywhere in the thigh, from the upper edge of the patella to a few centimetres below the saphenofemoral junction. The majority (71 per cent) were found in the middle third of the thigh. All incompetent thigh perforating veins were communicating with the long saphenous vein, including those in five patients with incomplete stripping.

Twenty-six patients who had undergone surgery for lower limb venous trauma (median elapsed time 19.5 months) underwent assessment. Injuries had been sustained to the external iliac, common femoral superficial femoral and popliteal veins in two, four, nine and eleven limbs respectively. Using clinical assessment, photoplethysmography recovery time, the presence of popliteal reflux and venographic evidence of thrombosis, the final outcome was graded as good, fair or poor. Fourteen patients had pedal oedema, including two with a postphlebitic limb. The overall photoplethysmography recovery time (mean and s.d.) was 20.6 (8.7) s in the injured and 32.1 (6.7) s in the non-injured limbs (P = 0.002). Patients with a venographically occluded vein had a shorter photoplethysmography recovery time than those in whom the vein was patent (13.4 (5.6) versus 21.6 (8.7) s; P = 0.07). Popliteal reflux was present in 12 injured limbs. Seven of 12 venograms performed on limbs with a vein repair had evidence of previous thrombosis. Vein ligation carried considerable morbidity and all end-to-end anastomoses initially failed. In retrospect, saphenous vein grafts were too narrow for the recipient veins and panel grafts might have been more appropriate. Overall 11 of 26 patients (42 per cent) had a poor result. The repair of choice is a saphenous vein patch for lesser injuries and a saphenous panel graft for major injuries. Vein ligation should be avoided unless another life-threatening injury demands priority.\r"

A low mean anal sphincter resting pressure before ileostomy closure was associated with subsequent nocturnal incontinence (P less than 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, the need to use constipating agents (P = 0.08). Pouch compliance if low before ileostomy closure was associated with an increased frequency of nocturnal stool frequency after 1 year (P less than 0.05). Anal canal length, and sphincter squeeze pressure and pouch capacity before ileostomy closure were not related to subsequent functional outcome in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The responses of the external anal sphincter and the internal anal sphincter to rectal distension were studied in 18 female patients who had idiopathic faecal incontinence with perineal descent and 11 female control subjects, by measuring pressures at six sites within the anal canal and the electrical activity of the external sphincter. The pressure profile in the normal anal canal, at rest, was asymmetric with the highest pressure recorded in the outermost channels. Rectal distension caused a transient increase in the activity of the external sphincter, which was associated with an increase in anal pressure, particularly in the outermost two channels. This was followed by a symmetrical reduction in anal pressure throughout the anal canal, caused by relaxation of the internal sphincter and shortening of the high-pressure zone. Two patterns of response were observed in the patients with idiopathic incontinence. Twelve patients (group 1) showed normal anal relaxation, but the maximum anal pressures recorded during rectal distension or a conscious squeeze were abnormally low, suggesting weakness of the external anal sphincter. The remaining six subjects (group 2), who were older than the group 1 patients, had much lower resting pressures and showed only external sphincter contraction in response to rectal distension, with no obvious internal sphincter relaxation. However, the maximum pressures recorded during a conscious contraction of the external sphincter were lower in this group than in the normal control subjects. These results suggest that group 2 patients have impaired internal anal sphincter tone, as well as external anal sphincter weakness. This may explain why all except one of the group 2 patients, compared with only 17 per cent of group 1 patients, reported incontinence to both solids and liquids.\r"

Satisfactory rehabilitation occurred in 33 per cent of above-knee, 62 per cent of through-knee and 44 per cent of Gritti-Stokes patients (56 per cent overall). The better rehabilitation of through-knee versus above-knee amputees (P less than 0.02) was also found in a group of patients matched for comparable age and duration of amputation as well as in a group of age-matched vascular amputees. Through-knee amputees relied significantly less on wheelchairs than above-knee (P = 0.016) and Gritti-Stokes (P = 0.05) amputees. The prosthesis used for the through-knee and Gritti-Stokes amputations was considered unsightly in 50 per cent of cases (versus 31 per cent for the above-knee prosthesis). The superior rehabilitation with through-knee amputations should prompt us to improve both our technique for this amputation and the prostheses currently available. A through-knee amputation should be performed in preference to an above-knee amputation in the case where either is surgically possible, and a below-knee amputation not feasible.\r"

All the responses were seen in patients with ascites only. Although tumor mass was an important determinant of response there was also a correlation between clinical response and suppression of colony growth on soft agar after in vitro exposure of tumor cells to interferon-alpha (IFN alpha). The intraperitoneal use of IFN alpha should be explored further in tumors with a predominant intraperitoneal location and microimplantation growth pattern.\r"

Women who gained more than 10 kg from early womanhood had a two-fold increase in risk of developing breast cancer, whereas lean women had a greater risk of being treated for benign breast disease. Obese women with breast cancer were more likely to have Stage II tumors but there was no significant association between obesity and tumor size or estrogen and progesterone receptor status. Obesity was strongly associated with the proportions of nonprotein-bound and albumin-bound estradiol, and inversely associated with sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels and the proportion of SHBG-bound estradiol. In addition, age at menarche was inversely associated, and age at menopause directly associated with recalled weight at those time periods. These data demonstrate weight gain as a risk factor for breast cancer, and suggest a possible mechanism supporting its development.\r"

In this study, the authors used specimens from resected colonic tissue to compare morphometric, proliferative, and enzyme markers in transitional mucosa with those in cancer tissue and with those in uninvolved mucosa at least 10 cm from the cancer. Proliferative activity was assessed using the Ki 67 monoclonal antibody technique whereas a variety of methods were used to determine enzyme activities in mucosal homogenates. When compared to uninvolved mucosa, crypts in transitional mucosa contained greater number of cells, were significantly deeper and wider and were more likely to be branched. However, crypts in transitional mucosa had a significantly lower labelling index using the Ki 67 technique and there was no evidence of a shift in the proliferative zone towards the bowel lumen. The activities of ornithine decarboxylase, thymidine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase were similar in transitional and uninvolved mucosa. Cancer tissue showed significantly higher levels of activity for ornithine decarboxylase and lactate dehydrogenase. Transitional mucosa showed morphometric changes but there were no proliferative or enzyme markers to suggest a higher than expected risk for malignant change.\r"

The study involved 53 patients, the presence of 24-KD protein together with keratin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was investigated by immunohistochemical analysis. Cytosol samples from 15 patients with squamous cervical carcinomas were also studied by the Western blot technique, and the presence of estrogen receptors was analyzed biochemically. The 24-KD protein was observed in cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN), but it was not useful to identify the different degrees of CIN examined. The 24-KD protein, keratin, and CEA were predominantly expressed in well and moderately differentiated squamous carcinomas in the more differentiated areas, and the protein was also found in cervical adenocarcinomas. The presence of 24-KD protein did not correlate with that of estrogen receptors in squamous cervical carcinomas. The Western blot and the immunohistochemical studies revealed that the antibody to 24-KD protein does not cross-react with epitopes of CEA and keratins.\r"

In one of these, Ostergotland county, the authors performed static cytofluorometry on 161 cancers detected at the second and third screening rounds, 50 interval cancers, and 219 cancers appearing in the nonscreened control group during the same time period. The median follow-up time was 42 months. No difference in mean S-phase was found between screening and control group cancers, but interval cancers, appearing between two screenings, had increased mean S-phase levels (P = 0.01) compared to both of the other groups. A high S-phase fraction was associated with distant recurrence in both node-negative and node-positive tumors. Aneuploid tumors were more often found in the control group (67%) and among interval cancers (72%) than among screening detected cancers (55%, P = 0.02). In Cox's multivariate analysis, including all patients, the lymph node status, tumor size, estrogen receptor content, and S-phase all contributed independent prognostic information about the clinical course. DNA ploidy predicted the outcome in simple but not in multivariate Cox's analysis. When analyzing screening-detected cancers separately, only the S-phase significantly predicted distant recurrence in multivariate analysis. In tumors with local recurrence, a high S-phase implicated an increased, although not statistically significant, risk for distant recurrence. Survival with metastatic disease was significantly influenced by the S-phase level (P = 0.002). The authors conclude that S-phase fraction provides valuable kinetic information related to the clinical outcome for all stages of the disease and serves as a prognostic factor in screened populations, which have tumors predominantly in early stages.\r"

After adjustment for stage of disease, there was no significant difference in median survival between HB and HC. Mitotic activity was associated with poor prognosis. Necrosis or vascular invasion did not influence prognosis. In 55 cases of completely resected HB, pure fetal histologic type (PFH) was associated with improved survival when compared with all other histologic patterns of HB (92% versus 57% 24 months' survival; P = 0.02). A prognostic effect of PFH was not demonstrable in incompletely resected HB, but the absence of mitoses and the presence of differentiated mesenchymal elements improved survival. The fibrolamellar pattern of HC demonstrated survival similar to that of the typical pattern of HC. The authors conclude that features consistent with differentiation in HB convey improved prognosis for survival. These observations may be important in designing future therapy for children with hepatic tumors.\r"

They were classified into the following three groups: (1) fasting blood sugar (FBS) of less than 120 mg/dl (Group A, 26 cases); (2) FBS of more than 120 mg/dl with less than 2-year history of diabetes (Group B, 38 cases); and (3) FBS of more than 120 mg/dl with more than a 2-year history of diabetes (Group C, 17 cases). Although neither tumor size nor tumor location differed between the three groups, both the highest resectability (47%) and the lowest rate (71%) of extrapancreatic invasion were seen in Group C. A pancreatic ductogram showed that the pattern of the main pancreatic duct was intact in 0% in Group C versus 35% in Group A (P less than 0.05). Histologically, papillary/well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was present in 35% of Group A patients versus 61% of Group B and 71% of Group C patients (P less than 0.05). Papillary hyperplasia was present in the ducts of 27% of the patients in Group A; this was significantly lower than the other two groups. Atypical duct hyperplasia was present in 47% of Group C patients; this was significantly higher than in the other two groups. It appears that cells in the main pancreatic duct are vulnerable to hyperplastic and well-differentiated cancerous changes in patients with a history of diabetes of more than 2 years duration.\r"

The authors have retrospectively analyzed this patient collective to evaluate the impact of routine technical and laboratory-chemical follow-up programs on the detection rate of subclinical distant metastases and improvement of prognosis. There was no difference in outcome in terms of survival after recurrence and overall survival between patients with detection or recurrence in the asymptomatic stage who received general antitumoral therapy immediately, and a second group whose therapy was initiated upon clinical manifestation. The authors discuss the results in view of the screening costs. They emphasize the potential of follow-up programs due to timely detection of local recurrence, and observation of the contralateral breast, as well as the psychological aspect of a stable doctor-patient relationship.\r"

  ".W": "It has been said that the prognosis of mucinous carcinoma of the colon and rectum is unfavorable. To determine the clinicopathologic significance of carcinomatous lesions with marked mucous production, the ratio of the area where there was significant mucous production (mucous component [MC]) to the area of the whole tumor on a tissue slice (area ratio) was determine by measurement with a digitizer in 281 patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum. The MC was observed in the largest cross-section of the tumor in 85 patients (30.2%). Of these 85 patients the MC area ratio was less than 10% in 42. In the 43 patients with an area ratio of 10% or more, no particular relationship was observed between the area ratio and the frequency of cases. If no MC was observed in the largest cross section of the tumor, the MC ratio in other regions of the tumor was almost 0. In the patients in whom the MC area ratio in the largest cross-section was less than 10%, the MC area ratios in other sites of the tumor showed only a small variance, but in the patients with an MC area ratio of 10% or more, a large variance was observed according to the site. The prognosis for patients with an area ratio of 10% or more was less favorable than that for patients with no MC and with an MC area ratio of less than 10% (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that it is reasonable to handle the patients with an MC area ratio of 10% or more as a group.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-four patients were treated with a radical or a nonradical pancreatectomy for ductal cell carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Their survival rates and the selection of the operative procedure were evaluated. In 32 patients, a radical pancreatectomy was attempted where there was sufficient clearance of regional or juxta-regional lymph nodes beyond the group of suspected metastatic nodes, as well as a resection of a greater margin of soft tissue around the pancreas. These patients' cumulative 5-year survival rate was 33.4%. In 14 Stage I or Stage II patients, the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 46.4%. In 18 Stage III or Stage IV patients, the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 20.7%. For 42 patients treated with a nonradical pancreatectomy with the dissection of lymph nodes adjacent to the pancreas or of regional lymph nodes but with insufficient clearance of the soft tissue around the pancreas, the cumulative 2-year and 3-year survival rates were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. In seven patients with Stage II carcinoma, the survival rate was 16.7% after 2 years and 0% after three years. In 35 Stage III or Stage IV patients, the survival rate was 3.2% after 2 years and 0% after 3 years. Thus, the survival rates were significantly higher in patients treated with radical operation than in patients who had nonradical operation. These results indicate that a radical pancreatectomy with sufficient lymph node clearance with the surrounding connective tissue around the pancreas is indispensable to cure patients with ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas.\r"

  ".W": "The growth type of early colorectal carcinoma was classified into two types. The first type is intramucosal polypoid growth (PG-Ca) and the second type nonpolypoid growth (NPG-Ca) which shows mainly massive infiltration of tumor cells below the submucosal layer. The incidence of adenoma-carcinoma sequence was 72 of 75 lesions (96.0%) in pedunculated polypoid carcinoma, and 61 of 71 lesions (85.9%) in sessile and broad-based polypoid carcinomas. Their average sizes were 15.0 and 18.7 mm, respectively. Submucosal invasive carcinoma (SM-Ca) showed a low incidence. They were detected as microscopical or scattered lesions with a few lymphatic and venous permeation. The NPG-Ca contained 32 lesions. Intramucosal carcinoma without adenoma showing slight depression consisted of ten lesions of which the average size was 5.1 mm. The other 22 lesions showed massive submucosal invasion with marked lymphatic and venous permeation. The average size was 10.3 mm being smaller than PG-Ca. Histologically, NPG-Ca was not accompanied with adenoma. The NPG-Ca arose from de novo carcinoma less than 10 mm in diameter and invaded into the submucosal layer. In advanced carcinoma, the PG-Ca showed a low incidence (21.8%), and almost all cases were of the NPG type (78.2%). The NPG advanced carcinomas increased in those over the size of 20 mm. It is concluded that nonpolypoid early colorectal carcinomas easily progress to advanced carcinoma, and de novo carcinoma occupied about 80% of colorectal carcinoma.\r"

Although NPC is a common neoplasm in local Chinese women, uterine cervical adenocarcinomas comprise only 8% of cervical cancers locally. The close occurrence of these cancers does not seem to be related to the therapy used for cervical cancer and suggests that an association of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with uterine cervical adenocarcinoma should be further investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Age-specific incidence curves, cumulative rates, and relative risks were estimated for selected malignancies among male veterans utilizing the Veterans Administration (VA) medical system during 1970 to 1982. Relative risks for malignant tumors of the lung, bronchus, larynx, oral cavity, and esophagus in males using VA hospitals were approximately double the rates for men of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, thereby supporting the existence of strong effects of chronic cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption on the development of neoplasms at these specific anatomic sites. Relative to the SEER male population, there were significant reductions in the cumulative rates of neoplasms of the colon (15%) and extrahepatic biliary tract (30%), no differences in the rates of cancer of the stomach, small intestine, or pancreas, and a 50% increase in the cumulative rate of liver cancer among the veterans. Rates of malignancies of the genitourinary tract were similar in the VA and SEER registries with the exception of cancer of the penis, for which the cumulative rate was 50% higher in the veterans. These results are consistent with an excess of specific risk exposures among male veterans using VA hospitals, viz., cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, and other factors related to low socioeconomic status. The ultimate utility of the VA tumor registry will depend upon its exploitation by epidemiologists to provide leads for etiologic research.\r"

Microscopic slides with cells having 50% or more atypical nuclei were found in 4.3% of those who had never smoked; 67.1% in those who had smoked less than 20 cigarettes a day; 82.3% in those who had smoked 20 to 39 cigarettes a day; and 88.4% of the 40 or more a day cigarette smokers. The percentage of slides with six or more cell rows in these groups were 4.8%, 52.2%, 62.5%, and 72.9%, respectively. The histologic findings in the urinary bladder in relation to smoking habits fully complement the epidemiologic studies showing a dose-response of cigarette smoking and urinary bladder cancer.

Cisplatin at 25 mg/d (4 hours of infusion) and bleomycin at 15 mg/d (20 hours of infusion) were administered for 10 consecutive days. Radical surgery was performed after clinical evaluation 2 weeks later. Clinical tumor regression (total disappearance or shrinkage of the tumor mass by more than 50%) was recorded in 28 of 31 (90.3%) patients. Tumor regression was then assessed pathologically using a procedure based on examination of large serial histologic sections of the whole surgical specimen. Tumor residue was classified pathologically according to the TNM categories: RO, no residual tumor (five cases [16.1%]); R1, microscopic residual tumor (tumor residue detectable only at the microscopic level; 12 cases [38.7%]); and R2, macroscopic residual tumor (tumor mass detectable also on the fresh or fixed specimen and/or by the naked eye on the stained tissue sections; 14 cases [45.2%]). Moreover, tumor cell and/or stromal changes possibly associated with tumor regression were found in 77.4% of the cases. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 12 cases (38.7%), and regression changes were observed in most lymph node metastases. Only standardized, prospective pathologic protocols for the analysis of whole specimens by serial sections permit the assessment of existing tumor residue. The TNM classification of pathologic tumor residue and definitions that we used appear feasible and reliable enough in evaluating postchemotherapeutic tumor regression.\r"

Fentanyl reduced the rises in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, heart rate, and rate pressure product and lidocaine decreased the rises in arterial blood pressure and rate pressure product (P less than 0.05). Fentanyl decreased the incidence of marked fluctuations in haemodynamic variables, often seen in geriatric patients (P less than 0.05). The haemodynamic effects of lidocaine and fentanyl were independent of each other. Complications occurred in all groups. Lidocaine-treated patients had fewer cardiac dysrhythmias (P less than 0.05) and 34 per cent of them had tinnitus. Fentanyl-treated patients had a higher incidence of hypotension (P less than 0.05). Respiratory depression developed in only one per cent of the fentanyl-treated patients. Both lidocaine and fentanyl are recommended adjuncts to induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone in geriatric patients.\r"

Three groups of five greyhounds received 1.5 micrograms.kg-1 of epinephrine 1:200,000 in lidocaine 0.5 per cent, bupivacaine 0.5 per cent or 0.9 per cent saline. Plasma epinephrine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, lactate, glucose and potassium concentrations were measured at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes following infiltration. Plasma epinephrine concentrations were significantly higher in the lidocaine group at one and two minutes following infiltration. Plasma bupivacaine concentrations were significantly higher than plasma lidocaine concentrations throughout the study period. There were no significant differences in metabolic or biochemical indices within or between the three groups. A local vasodilatory action of lidocaine may enhance epinephrine absorption. Differences in hepatic uptake and rate of metabolism may explain the increased plasma bupivacaine measured. Lidocaine may be the local anaesthetic of choice for ano-rectal procedures, especially when large volumes of local anaesthetic are being infiltrated.\r"

Onset time, clinical duration, and time to spontaneous recovery of T4/T1 ratio of 0.70 after atracurium or vecuronium injection were measured. No statistically significant differences were found in onset time, but clinical duration and time to recovery were significantly longer in patients receiving tobramycin or gentamicin and paralyzed with vecuronium than for controls (P less than 0.01 for clinical duration and P less than 0.0005 for recovery). The neuromuscular block produced by atracurium was not significantly influenced by the presence of therapeutic serum levels of tobramycin or gentamicin.

Neostigmine 0.04 mg.kg-1 (group A, n = 35) or 0.06 mg.kg-1 (group B, n = 35) was randomly mixed with one of seven doses of atropine (ranging from 0.014 to 0.04 mg.kg-1) in group A and from 0.02 to 0.04 mg.kg-1 in group B), with dose-response curves for atropine being constructed for both groups 5 and 10 min after injection of the mixture. These dose-response curves were found to be parallel in both groups. The calculated ED50 and ED95 values of atropine were similar in both groups. The estimated ED50 doses of atropine in groups A and B at 5 min were 0.031 and 0.033 mg.kg-1 respectively, and at 10 min the ED50 doses were 0.037 and 0.037 mg.kg-1 respectively.

Under the conditions employed in this study it would seem that in order to prevent late reductions in heart rates, the appropriate doses of atropine when used with neostigmine should be greater than that commonly used.\r"

Forty-four boys with DMD were exposed to anaesthesia and surgery 84 times during a period of 22 years (1965-86). The procedures took place at 15 different hospitals. Retrospective examination of the case records showed: 19 cases with local analgesia without any complications, and 18 of 65 general anaesthetics with minor or more serious complications. In ten cases an increase in body temperature above 37.5 degrees C was seen, five had abdominal pain and dark-coloured urine after surgery, and three had a critical perioperative course with a resemblance to malignant hyperthermia. The complications were almost exclusively related to the use of succinylcholine. The use of succinylcholine was dispersed through all ages. Three out of the eight patients with severe complications occurred 1.5, 2.5 and 4 years before the neuromuscular disease was diagnosed. Thus an unusual course of anaesthesia in male children calls for further investigation. Although it has been stated before that succinylcholine is contraindicated in patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, the drug continues to be used.\r"

Some motor control was maintained and sympathetic block was incomplete. Blood pressure and oxygenation were easily supported with optimum positioning, fluids, ephedrine and oxygen by mask. The patient remained alert. The duration of neural blockade was approximately two hours. The patient underwent a second epidural for labour analgesia that was uneventful. There were no sequelae. Subdural injections are uncommon and unpredictable in their occurrence. Test doses do not consistently identify misplaced catheters.

The baby had manifestations of hypothyroidism immediately after birth but later became hyperthyroid. The second patient's hyperthyroidism was well controlled but she stopped her medication one week before delivery. The Caesarean section was performed under general anaesthesia for fetal distress. The baby died in the neonatal period of extreme prematurity. The anaesthetic management of the hyperthyroid parturient is discussed. Preoperative control of hyperthyroidism, bearing in mind pregnancy and time constraints, is essential. The use of PTU, propranolol, iodine, and glucocorticoids is described in the preparation of the parturient. Fetal and neonatal effects of these drugs are discussed.\r"

Eighty-five charts of all patients undergoing primary craniosynostosis repair over a 15-year period were reviewed to determine blood loss and to assess blood transfusion practices both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Blood loss was calculated on the basis of estimated red cell mass (ERCM). Blood transfusion management was considered appropriate if the postoperative or posttransfusion ERCM was within 15 per cent of the preoperative value. Isolated sagittal craniectomy was the most common operation performed (60 per cent). Mean blood loss for sagittal craniectomies was 24 per cent of estimated blood volume (EBV) or approximately 20 ml.kg-1 and for metopic craniectomies 42 per cent of EBV (P less than 0.05). Intraoperatively, 70 per cent of all patients were appropriately managed with respect to blood transfusion. Postoperatively only 29 per cent of patients receiving transfusions were transfused appropriately. At our institution, intraoperative blood transfusion practices are appropriate, but postoperative transfusions are frequently unnecessary.\r"

The patient's first renal biopsy was performed 5 years after the onset of her renal symptoms. This biopsy was compared to a second renal biopsy taken just before the patient became pregnant. The second renal biopsy only showed a slight progression in the disease process. During the course of pregnancy, neither renal insufficiency nor hypertension were clinically evident. However, both an increase in proteinuria and a transient hypoalbuminemia were observed. The pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum course for both the mother and child were without complications. Cases of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I and pregnancy have been reported. However, to our knowledge, there are few reports documenting the outcome of pregnancy when a patient has membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II. We suggest that it is possible for a patient with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II to have an uneventful pregnancy if she has neither hypertension nor renal insufficiency.\r"

A further restriction can be expected when these patients are exposed to hypoxia at altitude, since most of the usual compensatory mechanisms required to adjust to this environment are impaired or even missing. We tested the tolerance of hemodialysis patients to hypoxia and measured work capacity, hematological, and cardiovascular parameters at rest and during incremental bicycle ergometry during 3-hour exposure to altitudes of 2,000 m and 3,000 m, and during 2 weeks of exposure to an altitude of 2,000 m and compared these data with prealtitude values or with data evaluated in a control group, respectively. In control tests the patients reached work loads at exercise termination of about 66% of age and sex-matched healthy controls, the reduction correlated well with the degree of anemia. During short-term altitude exposure to 2,000 m peak work performance remained unchanged in comparison to prealtitude tests, whereas at 3,000 m it was reduced by about 12%. During the 2-week stay at 2,000 m peak work loads increased significantly by 17% accompanied by an increase in peak oxygen uptake (+15%), blood lactate, heart rates (+10 min-1), and systolic blood pressure (+20 mmHg), whereas the diastolic pressure was comparable to prealtitude values. In another group of hemodialysis patients studied at low altitude under similar experimental conditions none of these parameters was changed. Our data show that during acute exposure to altitudes up to 2,000 m maximal work of hemodialysis patients is not reduced, but is restricted at altitudes higher than that.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As a first step towards the investigation of a possible role for local disturbances of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in immune mediated mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, glomerular All receptors have been quantitated retrospectively in biopsy tissue from 20 patients with IgA nephropathy for comparison with 16 biopsies that showed only minor abnormalities by light microscopy and negative immunofluorescence. An autoradiographic technique using 125I labelled [Sar1, Ile8] All facilitated the quantitation of All receptors in frozen tissue sections. Following exposure to the treated sections, x-ray film was analyzed by computerized micro-densitometry. The data obtained were optical densities of areas corresponding to the presence of glomeruli verified by reference to adjacent sections stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). There was no significant difference between patients 0.67 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- SD) and controls 0.61 +/- 0.15. Among patients there was no statistically significant correlation of glomerular All receptor density with either the degree of mesangial proliferation or the extent of hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). There was no apparent relationship with hypertension. The absence of an increase in glomerular All receptors despite proliferation of the glomerular mesangium may represent a local down regulation in patients with IgA nephropathy.\r"

During the 11-year period from 1977 through 1987, the United Kingdom led the United States in the number of first introductions of new drugs (114 versus 41), in average lead time for mutually available drugs (60.7 versus 28.9 months), and in the number of exclusively available drugs (70 versus 54). Analysis by therapeutic category indicated large United Kingdom leads in the introduction of respiratory (5.1 years), cardiovascular (3.2 years), central nervous system (3.2 years), and anti-cancer (2.9 years) agents, and shorter leads for anesthetic and analgesic (2.0 years), gastrointestinal (2.0 years), endocrine (1.4 years), and anti-infective (0.8 years) agents. A comparison of the 5-year period from 1983 through 1987 with the previous 5-year period (1978 through 1982) showed no change in the length of the lag time (1.9 years for each period). These results indicate that the United States continues to lag behind the United Kingdom in the availability of new drugs.\r"

Toxicity is in part caused by the incorporation of azathioprine-derived 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) plays an important role in azathioprine catabolism. TPMT activity is controlled by a common genetic polymorphism, and one in 300 subjects has very low enzyme activity. Azathioprine was withdrawn in five study patients because of acute myelosuppression. The duration of azathioprine treatment was 21 to 70 days (median, 28), and the daily oral dose was 1.0 to 2.5 mg/kg. Sixteen control patients who had been taking oral azathioprine (1.1 to 2.0 mg/kg daily for more than 6 months) with no history of myelosuppression were studied. All subjects had normal liver and kidney function. When compared with the control group, the five patients with myelosuppression had very low TPMT activities and abnormally high 6-TGN concentrations. Inherited low TPMT activity appears to be a major risk factor for acute azathioprine-induced myelosuppression.\r"

Of these 161 patients, 51 (32%) had plasma phenobarbital concentrations (corrected for dose and weight) that were less than 90% of the lowest value previously found in normal volunteers, which suggested poorer compliance. When compared with the age-related volunteer values, 77 (48%) had values that were less than 90% of the lowest volunteer value. There were 6 of 10 patients with apparently excessive (greater than or equal to 110%) compliance by return tablet count and 4 of 12 who failed to return their container who also had phenobarbital concentrations that were less than 90% of the lowest volunteer value. We concluded that return tablet count grossly overestimates compliance.\r"

All patients had a history of hydralazine-induced lupus and were slow acetylators. None of the patients included in this study showed any current signs or symptoms of drug-induced lupus. No evidence of lupus-like symptoms or of immunologic laboratory abnormalities were found during the study period. Side effects associated with vasodilator therapy were noted in some patients but were transient and mild. We concluded that a cross-reaction between cadralazine and hydralazine does not seem likely to occur and that cadralazine, because of its chemical properties, probably will not give rise to drug-induced lupus.\r"

NAPA distribution was modeled with a three compartment mammillary system. The central compartment volume of 14.1 +/- 2.6 L (mean +/- SD) was similar to expected intravascular space, corrected for NAPA partitioning between erythrocytes and plasma. Other compartment volumes, intercompartmental and nonrenal clearances, and the steady-state distribution volume of 1.45 +/- 0.09 L/kg were similar to normal subject values. The least-squares estimate of 1.67 for the NAPA renal clearance/creatinine clearance ratio was similar to the value of 1.68 previously reported for functionally anephric patients and showed the expected age-associated decrease. The oral NAPA dose was 78.0% +/- 11.7% absorbed and interindividual variation in NAPA absorption was correlated with fast intercompartmental clearance (r = 0.89, p = 0.045). Because fast intercompartmental clearance partly reflects splanchnic blood flow, hemodynamic changes may affect NAPA bioavailability, as has been found for procainamide.\r"

Plasma and urine concentrations of zidovudine and its glucuronidated metabolite (GAZT) were measured simultaneously by HPLC assay. In healthy subjects, GAZT concentrations were higher than those of AZT; AUC values were 23.7 +/- 1.9 and 5.2 +/- 0.6 mumol.hr/L, respectively. Formation of GAZT rate-limits its elimination: GAZT half-life (t 1/2) parallels that of AZT, which is around 1 hour. In uremic patients, AZT concentrations were moderately increased (AUC = 11.7 +/- 1.1 mumol.hr/L), whereas t 1/2 and mean residence time (MRT) remain unchanged despite the decreased renal clearance (16 +/- 2 versus 220 +/- 58 ml/min) and decreased urinary excretion (1.6 +/- 0.3 versus 8.1 +/- 1.0% of the dose). In contrast, GAZT concentrations are markedly increased (AUC = 402.9 +/- 88.6 mumol.hr/L). As a consequence of the decreased renal clearance (27 +/- 3 versus 331 +/- 42 ml/min), elimination is the rate-limiting step and t 1/2 is increased (8 +/- 2 versus 0.9 +/- 0.1 hr). Contribution of a 4-hour hemodialysis session to AZT elimination appears to be negligible, whereas elimination of GAZT is enhanced. On the sole basis of AZT pharmacokinetic data, no particular dose adjustment appears to be necessary in patients who have severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 10 and 30 ml/min). However, high levels of GAZT should be anticipated with the usual dosage regimen.\r"

  ".W": "We examined genetically determined oxidation polymorphisms of metoprolol and mephenytoin in 200 unrelated, healthy Japanese subjects and in 98 mainland Chinese subjects simultaneously. This examination was done according to the respective reported phenotyping criteria by use of the urinary metabolic ratio of metoprolol and of the percentage of excretion of 4-hydroxymephenytoin 8 hours after dose administration. The frequencies of occurrence of poor metabolizers (PMs) in the Japanese versus the Chinese subjects were 0.5% versus 0% for metoprolol and 22.5% versus 17.4% for mephenytoin, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in these frequencies between the two Oriental populations. However, Chinese extensive metabolizers (EMs) showed a significantly lower excretion of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (p less than 0.01) and 4-hydroxymephenytoin (p less than 0.001) than that of Japanese EMs, and the mode of the distribution histogram of the Chinese EMs for the two test probes was skewed compared with that of the Japanese EMs. The findings indicate that the two Far Eastern Oriental subject groups have a lower frequency of PM phenotype of debrisoquin/sparteine-type oxidation and a greater incidence of PM phenotype of mephenytoin oxidation compared with the respective frequencies reported from white subjects. However, the explanation for the observation that the metabolic capacities of the test drugs differed between the EMs of the two populations who had a similar ethnic origin and who resided in the same geographic area remains obscure.\r"

Three hundred and eighty-four patients with essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure, 95 to 110 mm Hg) were assigned to one of 12 groups that received all combinations of four doses of pinacidil (0, 12.5, 25, and 37.5 mg, b.i.d.) with three doses of hydrochlorothiazide (0, 12.5, and 25 mg, b.i.d.). Significant dose- and concentration-effect relationships were seen for pinacidil and hydrochlorothiazide on diastolic blood pressure. For pinacidil, dose- and concentration-effect relationships were steeper after the dose than before the dose. A significant interaction with hydrochlorothiazide was noted such that, when combined with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg pinacidil had near-maximal effects on blood pressure at both peak and trough. Edema occurred in 47% of those who received 37.5 mg pinacidil monotherapy (19% discontinued). The administration of 12.5 mg pinacidil with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide appears to be optimal for efficacy and safety.\r"

The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP, determined by radial immunodiffusion, increased significantly with age: the concentration found in neonates was less than that found in infants which, in turn, was less than that found in older children (p less than 0.001). In addition, we determined the effect of alpha 1-AGP on the free fraction of lidocaine in four groups of infants and children who received intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg). The percentage of free lidocaine correlated inversely and linearly with the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration (r2 = 0.617; p less than 0.001). The percentage of free lidocaine in the five neonates exceeded that in the older age groups. We conclude that the serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP increases while the free fraction of lidocaine decreases from early infancy to adolescence.\r"

All subjects and patients had normal hepatic and renal functions. The children received an intravenous injection of nalbuphine (0.2 mg/kg), and the subjects and patients in groups II and III received, at random, 10 mg intravenous injections and 30 mg oral doses of nalbuphine on two separate occasions. The distribution of nalbuphine was not modified with age. Elimination half-life (t1/2) was significantly shorter in group I (0.9 hour) than it was in group II (1.9 hours) and in group III (2.3 hours). Systemic clearance of nalbuphine decreased significantly with age. Absolute bioavailability of nalbuphine increased from F = 12% in group II to 46.3% in group III (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that doses and rates of administration of nalbuphine should be adapted in younger patients and in elderly patients.\r"

The segmented thermal clearance probe is a non-invasive instrument which measures heat thermal clearance, a variable directly proportional to superficial blood flow, with a depth sensitivity theoretically proportional to the sensor diameter. We compared an 18 mm sensor and a recently developed 57 mm sensor with the reference technique of xenon washout. 2. The theoretical depth sensitivity of the sensors was assessed using Perspex spacers. Ninety-five per cent of sensitivity had been lost at the respective depths of 3.5 mm and 7.1 mm for the 18 mm and 57 mm sensors. 3. A comparison was made between heat thermal clearance reading and 133Xe decay curves using the two probes for 15 min after injection of 133Xe at 2 mm and 6 mm depths in the anterior thigh in 41 subjects. The 57 mm sensor showed similar correlation with xenon washout at 2 mm injection depth (r = 0.89) and 6 mm injection depth (r = 0.86), whereas the 18 mm sensor showed greater correlation at 2 mm (r = 0.92) than at 6 mm (r = 0.62). 4. The 57 mm sensor was compared with xenon washout at 6 mm in eight insulin-treated diabetic subjects. The relationship was similar to that in non-diabetic subjects (r = 0.79), with no significant difference in slope or intercept. 5. It is concluded that the 57 mm thermal clearance probe may be used to study blood flow at the depth of insulin injection (6 mm) in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.\r"

The infusion of 0.1 mol/l KCl at 3.0 ml/h for 60 min in control rats resulted in a significant increase in urinary kallikrein excretion, associated with diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis. 3. When rats were offered 0.1 mol/l KCl to drink ad libitum for 14 days (K+-adaptation), the basal excretion of kallikrein was higher than in the control rats. In K+-adapted rats, intravenous infusion of 0.1 mol/l KCl resulted in significantly greater increase in urinary kallikrein excretion than in the control rats. 4. The Na+-channel blocker, amiloride (8.5 mg/kg body weight), significantly increased urinary kallikrein excretion immediately after injection in control and K+-adapted rats. However, in the subsequent 60 min, kallikrein excretion decreased markedly to values lower than those before injection of amiloride. 5. When amiloride was superimposed on a continuous 0.1 mol/l KCl infusion in K+-adapted rats, there was an immediate increase in kallikrein excretion. In the subsequent 20 min, kallikrein excretion decreased only to increase again in the next 40 min of KCl infusion. 6. Since amiloride injection reduces urinary kallikrein excretion in control and K+-adapted rats, the results suggest that urinary kallikrein excretion in the rat is through a mechanism(s) affected by amiloride. The high urinary kallikrein excretion and the greater response to KCl infusion in K+-adapted rats suggest that the K+-transport mechanism is more important than the mechanism affected by amiloride.\r"

Bacterial endotoxin in concentrations above 6 micrograms/ml significantly increased fibronectin digestion by neutrophils, but leukotriene B4, interferon-gamma and interleukin-1 alpha had no significant effects. 3. Dexamethasone inhibited fibronectin digestion by neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner, from 11% at 10(-10) mol/l to 68% at 10(-3) mol/l.\r"

In various tissues, enkephalins are partly degraded by a membrane metallo-endopeptidase, enkephalinase (EC 3.4.24.11). 2. Using 3H-labelled [D-Ala2,Leu5]enkephalin as a substrate, enkephalinase activity, immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody directed against the rabbit kidney enzyme, was demonstrated in the feline gall bladder. Using the same antibody in 125I-labelled form, the peptidase was immunolocalized by autoradiography, mainly in the epithelium. 3. In experimental cholecystitis, elicited by implantation of human gall-stones into the cat gall bladder, the continuous fluid secretion into the lumen was inhibited by exogenous enkephalins. 4. Acetorphan, an enkephalinase inhibitor, was found to block fluid secretion by the inflamed gall bladder via a naloxone-sensitive mechanism, but not to affect fluid transport in the normal gall bladder. The drug also transiently contracted the gall bladder and increased bile outflow from the liver. 5. It is suggested that acetorphan, by reducing the degradation of endogenous enkephalins in the inflamed gall bladder, decreases fluid secretion by the epithelium and that enkephalinase inhibitors may find clinical applications in acute cholecystitis.\r"

Kidneys flushed with PB immediately before 45 min pedicle clamp ischaemia exhibited a post-ischaemic function similar to that of control, non-flushed kidneys: they were isosthenuric and non-oliguric with a clearance of inulin (Cin) depressed to 10% of the pre-ischaemic value. 3. Kidneys flushed with 50 mmol/l sucrose in saline before ischaemia became isosthenuric, oliguric and had a more severely depressed post-ischaemic Cin compared with non-flushed kidneys. 4. Kidneys flushed with PBS containing either 50 (PBS50) or 140 (PBS140) mmol/l sucrose at pH 7 became polyuric after ischaemia, produced concentrated urine and had Cin values significantly higher than control kidneys. 5. Raising the pH of the PBS50 to 7.4 resulted in isosthenuric, polyuric kidneys that had a post-ischaemic Cin not significantly different from that of the control group. 6. It is concluded that the severity of the initial phase of ischaemic acute renal failure was significantly reduced by intrarenal flush with a PBS solution of pH 7; flush with PB or sucrose alone had no protective action.\r"

Collagen and PAF induced aggregation and secretion in human platelets in a dose-related manner. 3. Aspirin inhibited the magnitude of both platelet aggregation and secretion induced by PAF and collagen, but the degree of inhibition was much greater for collagen. 4. Aspirin strongly inhibited the aggregation rate of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, but had no measurable effect on the rate of PAF-induced aggregation. 5. Inconsistencies reported in previous studies of the effect of aspirin on PAF-induced platelet aggregation may be explained, in part, by the doses of PAF used and the method of inactivating cyclo-oxygenase (in vitro compared with in vivo). 6. Our results suggest that the initial events of PAF-induced aggregation are independent of thromboxane A2 formation and that thromboxane A2 plays only a minor role in the later phase of PAF-induced aggregation.\r"

This reduction in squeeze anal pressure was accompanied by an increase in the mean pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, indicating damage to this nerve, and increased perineal descent in the resting and straining positions. The fiber density, recorded by single fiber electromyography in the external anal sphincter muscle, a muscle innervated by the pudendal nerves, was increased in the sixth decade, indicating the later development of compensatory reinnervation in this muscle. The interrelation of aging, menopausal effects, and parity in these changes is difficult to define from currently available data, but the authors suggest, from other evidence, that menopausal effects may be relevant.\r"

Eighty-six (32 percent) patients did not receive blood transfusions, whereas the remaining 110 (41 percent) received packed cells and 74 (27 percent) received at least 2 units of whole blood. The recurrence-free and overall 5-year survival rates for the transfused group were 58 and 57 percent, respectively, and for the non-transfused group, 78 and 72 percent, respectively. These differences were highly significant (log rank test, P less than 0.001). The recurrence-free and overall 5-year survival rates for patients who received only whole blood or a combination of whole blood and packed cells was 51 percent, and of those who received only packed cells was 63 percent. The difference was not statistically significant (log rank test, P = 0.08, P = 0.35). Administration of more than 6 units of blood is attended with a significantly worse 5-year disease-free survival rate than administration of a smaller volume. The survival was not decreased if 6 or more units of whole blood were given. The authors conclude that perioperative blood transfusions have a significant detrimental effect on survival after curative resection for colorectal carcinoma. This effect is not enhanced by whole blood transfusions.\r"

Recurrence of Crohn's disease was documented by radiographic studies, endoscopy, or laparotomy. During the hospital admission for resection, 45 patients received multiple red blood cell transfusions. Recurrence developed in 22 percent of these patients by 36 months, and the median time to recurrence was 35 months. In the 34 patients who did not receive multiple transfusions, recurrence was found in 44 percent by 36 months, and the median time to recurrence was 20 months. These differences are significant, using the Kaplan-Meier analysis (P less than 0.04). Recurrence in patients with disease limited to the small bowel or to the colon was not significantly affected by the transfusion status. However, recurrence developed in only 10 percent of multiply transfused patients with ileocolic disease by 36 months, whereas recurrence developed in 45 percent of the patients who were not multiply transfused. (Significance, P = 0.057). The authors believe that the observed decreased rate of recurrence of Crohn's disease in patients receiving multiple perioperative transfusions may represent another example of clinically significant immunosuppression from blood transfusion.\r"

Three patients with rectal perforations manifested by air extravasation were successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics and complete bowel rest. Two patients with barium extravasation were treated with immediate operation and colostomy. All five patients recovered. Perforation was found to be associated with a rectal stricture due to ulcerative colitis, a rectal cancer, an incarcerated inguinal hernia, fulminant ulcerative colitis, and a normal colon in an elderly patient. To determine the pressure in the rectum that could potentially be generated during a barium-enema examination, the pressures created by a standard barium delivery set were measured, using 1-meter columns of water, 25 percent diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque), 20 percent barium, and 80 percent barium. The columns generated pressures of 70, 85, 95, and 120 mm Hg respectively. Squeezing the delivery bag increased the pressure 21 to 79 percent or a maximum of 55 mm Hg. Colorectal perforation during barium-enema examination that was not accompanied by barium extravasation could be successfully treated nonoperatively. The associated pathology and our studies of pressures generated during a barium-enema examination allow us to suggest that the incidence of colorectal perforation during barium-enema radiography can be reduced by 1) performing proctoscopy prior to barium enema, 2) avoiding the use of the rectal balloon in patients with known rectal lesions, 3) avoiding barium studies in patients with active colitis, 4) avoiding generation of pressure greater than that created by a column of barium suspension of one meter, and 5) using a lower concentration of barium when possible.\r"

No reflex was evident when the water was 37 degrees C. At 27 degrees C or 45 degrees C, the reflex was evident occasionally. In patients with Hirschsprung's disease, the rectoanal reflex was absent with balloon distention, and when water at any temperature was injected. As cold water will induce the rectoanal reflex safely and without rectal distention, measurement of the reflex using cold water is useful when the presence or absence of the reflex is doubtful. The authors' results suggest that the receptor related to the reflex is neuronal in origin and not muscular, and that the receptor locates near the mucosa.\r"

Transanal extirpation is an alternative to transsphincteric and abdominoperineal resection in the treatment of early well or moderately well-differentiated cancer of the rectum. The surgical procedure is simple and has few complications; however, only tumors extending no deeper than the submucosa are suitable for this treatment. The operation should be followed by frequent sigmoidoscopies and rectal palpation. The procedure should be defined as an excisional biopsy until results from the histologic examination are presented.\r"

There was no statistical difference in mean age or duration of diabetes among the various study groups. All diabetic subjects who presented with complaints of impotence had severe abnormalities on nocturnal erection monitoring. There was no significant difference in the mean penile brachial index between impotent and nonimpotent diabetic subjects (P = .335). In contrast, there was a significant difference in bulbocavernosus-reflex latency times (P less than .001) between impotent (mean latency 48.4 ms) and nonimpotent (mean latency 38.7 ms) diabetic subjects. This study strongly suggests that impotence in the diabetic population is secondary to functional abnormalities of pelvic nerves and that the bulbocavernosus-reflex latency time is an excellent diagnostic test for assessing function of pelvic nerves in the diabetic individual.\r"

Despite these findings, the clinical and epidemiological significance of IGT has not been well investigated. The Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional study in which 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed, has provided an opportunity to examine the characteristics of IGT in the U.S. population. Data from the survey have been extrapolated to represent all U.S. residents. The findings indicate that approximately 11.2% of Americans aged 20-74 yr have IGT compared to 6.6% with diabetes. Rates of IGT increased with age for White men and women and Black men but declined for Black women greater than 54 yr of age, possibly because greater obesity in Black women precipitated earlier conversion of IGT to diabetes. The distribution of 2-h glucose values showed IGT to be part of a continuum of glucose intolerance extending from normal to diabetes. Individuals with IGT had rates of risk factors for non-insulin-dependent diabetes (age, plasma glucose, past obesity, family history of diabetes, physical inactivity) that were intermediate between those of individuals with normal glucose tolerance and those with diabetes, although current obesity was similar for IGT and diabetes. The proportion of people with medical histories of diabetes-related conditions did not differ between IGT and normal glucose tolerance. However, several cardiovascular findings were more prevalent in individuals with IGT than in those with normal glucose tolerance, including hypertension, serum cholesterol, angina, abnormal heart findings, and medical history of arteriosclerosis and stroke. Both obesity and reported family history of diabetes were associated with higher rates of IGT, with the effect of weight gain on the prevalence of IGT occurring at lower levels than for diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Fructose is credited with some advantages over sucrose: it causes less of an increment in plasma glucose and insulin response, and the taste is sweeter. We reevaluated the latter property with a new methodology (the \"up and down\" method adapted from Dixon) in 33 healthy subjects, 17 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients, and 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. Sweetening potency was determined over 2-3 test sessions in each subject. Results are expressed in percent as the relative sweetness (R) of fructose (F) over sucrose (S), taken as reference. In the first set of experiments, with a 30-g/L sucrose-water solution at pH 7, we found that R values were similar for healthy subjects (102 +/- 8%) and diabetic subjects (106 +/- 7%) (P less than .05). No significant difference between IDDM and NIDDM patients was observed. In a second set of experiments, performed in healthy subjects only, R was increased in acid water (114%; P less than .01), in lemon juice (136%; P less than .001), in water at 2 degrees C (130%; P less than .001), and in coffee at 2 degrees C (120%; P less than .02); mean values were decreased in grapefruit juice (77%; P less than .001), in water at 43 degrees C (88%; P less than .01), and in coffee at 53 degrees C (87%; P less than .001). We found that the test methodology had a very satisfactory intrasubject reproducibility (coefficient of variation [C.V.] less than 8%) but a very wide intersubject variability (C.V. congruent to 32%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Slides were scored from 0 (no fibrosis) to 3+ (complete fibrosis). Nineteen IDDM subjects aged 30-60 yr (mean +/- SE 44.9 +/- 2.5 yr) at autopsy and with duration of diabetes 13-45 yr (26.8 +/- 1.8 yr) were studied. Twelve NIDDM subjects aged 61-84 yr (73.3 +/- 2.5 yr) with duration of diabetes 17-33 yr (22.8 +/- 1.9 yr) were studied. Twenty-two nondiabetic subjects aged 32-77 yr (53.7 +/- 2.9 yr) were studied. Four of 19 (27%) IDDM subjects had moderate to severe fibrosis compared to 1 of 12 (8.3%) NIDDM subjects and 1 of 22 (4.5%) control subjects. Thirteen of 19 (68%) IDDM subjects had a score of 1, 2, or 3 compared to 3 of 22 (13.6%) control subjects (P less than .0005). There was an association between duration of IDDM and fibrosis score (r = .46, P less than .05) and between age and fibrosis score among IDDM subjects (r = .57, P = .01). No association between age or duration of diabetes and fibrosis score was observed for NIDDM or control subjects. Adrenal medullary fibrosis may be an anatomical correlate of the diminished epinephrine secretion that occurs in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in some IDDM subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The study of HLA histocompatibility antigens and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in non-White populations may provide a unique opportunity to more accurately define the diabetes susceptibility gene(s) located within the HLA region. To determine whether HLA haplotypes differ between ethnic groups, we compared 105 HLA haplotypes from 55 Mexican-American IDDM patients with 272 haplotypes from 136 IDDM patients of non-Hispanic White descent. The accurate determination of genotypes and haplotypes requires the study of family units. Therefore, all diabetic patients in this study were from studies of families having one or more siblings with IDDM. In the Mexican-American group, HLA-DR3 and -DR4 were the most common HLA-DR alleles and were present in comparable frequencies in the non-Hispanic White group (HLA-DR3, 27% of Mexican-American and 29% of non-Hispanic White haplotypes; DR4, 46% of Mexican-American and 43% of non-Hispanic White haplotypes). However, the HLA-B/DR-containing haplotypes and haplotype frequencies differed between the two groups. Several common haplotypes (B8/DR3, B15/DR4) in the non-Hispanic White group occurred less frequently in the Mexican-American group. In contrast, uncommon haplotypes in the non-Hispanic White group comprised nearly 50% of the DR4-containing haplotypes (B35/DR4, B40/DR4, B44/DR4) in the Mexican-American group. Although both DR3- and DR4-haplotype frequencies differed significantly between the two groups, the relative frequency of DR3- but not DR4-containing haplotypes was similar in both ethnic groups. This adds to the evidence suggesting that different susceptibilities are provided by the haplotypes carrying the DR3 and DR4 alleles.\r"

The EBI is a standardized questionnaire that assesses behavioral strategies typically taught in a behavioral weight-loss program. Pretreatment scores on the EBI were not related to weight-loss outcome, but changes on the EBI in the direction of more frequent use of appropriate strategies were related to weight loss at both posttreatment and 1-yr follow-up. Specific strategies related to weight loss at both times were 1) eating foods that help in losing weight, 2) recording foods eaten, 3) refusing food offered by others, and 4) being able to stop eating when appropriate. However, few patients maintained frequent use of these strategies at follow-up. It is concluded that weight-loss programs should focus on the strategies most strongly related to weight loss and try to improve long-term use of these techniques.\r"

The direct response of Sertoli cells to testosterone in cell culture was studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled cellular proteins. Changes in testosterone responsiveness with age and hormonal condition were studied by culturing Sertoli cells from 20- and 40-day-old normal rats and 40-day-old rats that had been hypophysectomized at 20 days of age. Two abundant proteins, numbered 1604 and 1605 for reference purposes, were consistently increased in response to testosterone treatment in all three sets of cultured Sertoli cells. Two other proteins, 1602 and 1603, were decreased with testosterone in all three Sertoli cell cultures. Densitometric scanning of the gels revealed changes in several proteins of low abundance (i.e. proteins that represent less than 0.2% of the total incorporated radioactivity on the gel) in response to testosterone. The majority of the changes in response to testosterone were in these low abundance proteins. Protein profiles from testosterone-treated cell cultures as well as control (no hormone) Sertoli cell cultures differed among the three groups of cells. This indicates that differences in Sertoli cell function in vivo due to age and hormonal condition are reflected in culture by protein profiles.\r"

  ".W": "Triphenylethylenes [Tamoxifen (TAM), TAM metabolites, and nafoxidine] were found to inhibit Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM)-dependent cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of the quail oviduct, whereas 17 beta-estradiol was inactive. The Ca2+-CaM-independent PDE activity was not affected by triphenylethylenes, suggesting that they do not interact directly with the active site of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicated that these drugs competitively inhibited the activation of PDE by CaM with the following potencies: N-desmethyltamoxifen, Ki = 3 microM; metabolite Z, trans-4-hydroxytamoxifen, and TAM Ki = 5 microM; nafoxidine, Ki = 8.5 microM; and metabolite Y and cis-4-hydroxytamoxifen, Ki = 50 microM. Injected alone into immature quails, none of these drugs significantly affected oviduct weight. When administrated together with estradiol benzoate, these drugs reduced the trophic effect of estradiol in a dose-dependent relationship, with ID50 values ranging from 0.07 mg/kg for N-desmethyltamoxifen to 2.02 mg/kg for cis-4-hydroxytamoxifen. The order of growth inhibitory potency was not correlated with estrogen receptor affinities, but was the same as that reported for PDE inhibition. This correlation suggests that interaction of antiestrogen with Ca2+-CaM dependent PDE may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the estrogen antagonist activity of these drugs.\r"

  ".W": "It is often implied that the various molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) are mediated in brain exclusively via the interactions of this synthetic steroid with the classical glucocorticoid (type II) receptor. The results reported in this study, however, suggest this generalization may, at least for the female mouse, be too restrictive. In the first experiment we compared the efficacy of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone (ALDO) with that of DEX to measure the classical mineralocorticoid (type I) receptor in brain cytosol. Since both of these steroids also bind to type II receptors, our assays included the type II receptor-selective ligand, RU26988. Whereas the specific binding of ALDO to type I receptors was largely unaffected by a 10-fold increase in the concentration of RU26988 (50- vs. 500-fold excess), there was a dramatic reduction in the specific binding of DEX. In a follow-up experiment, Scatchard analyses were used to confirm the differential affinity of RU26988 for DEX- vs. ALDO-type I receptor-binding sites and to reveal that the affinity of type I receptors for DEX (Kd approximately 0.83 nM) was nearly as high as it was for ALDO (Kd approximately 0.46 nM). A series of competition studies indicated that the competitive affinity (Kdc) of DEX for the ALDO-binding site was equivalent to the Kd computed in the saturation analyses, thus suggesting that the high affinity binding sites for DEX and ALDO on type I receptors may be equivalent or at least overlapping. The binding of DEX to these high affinity sites may prove to be important, since the systemic administration of this steroid was found to down-regulate both type I and type II receptors in a number of brain regions. Because coadministration of the type I receptor antagonist RU26752 was shown to block these actions on type I, but not type II receptors, the formation of the DEX-type I receptor complex appears to be required for DEX-induced type I receptor down-regulation. An analysis of the in vitro efficacy of ALDO- vs. DEX-type I receptor transformation suggests that whereas there is a significant increase in the binding of both complexes to DNA-cellulose after treatment with thiocyanate, there is also a dramatic decrease in the stability of DEX- but not ALDO-type I receptor binding. We contend that it is this decrease in binding stability that mediates the DEX-induced down-regulation of type I receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Such information is of crucial importance in any attempt to relate the structure with the function of hTPO. To probe the antigenic surface of hTPO and to correlate its immunological structure to its biochemical properties, we used 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) displaying various affinity for hTPO. Criss-cross experiments showed 7 clusters of reactivity which were interpreted as reflecting 7 epitopes on the surface of the hTPO molecule. Extending our analysis to partial and nonsymmetrical cross-reactivities, these epitopes were shown to be localized in 4 antigenic domains of the hTPO. We further investigated the nature of these 7 hTPO epitopes by testing mAb binding to peroxidases from various origins and chemically modified hTPO; 3 epitopes were shown to be evolutionary conserved, and 5 resistant to reduction and denaturation. We also analyzed the role of the hTPO epitopes in the enzymatic activity and autoimmune targeting of the molecule. Nine epitopes were shown to be localized at the vicinity of both catalytic sites as the binding of their respective mAb modulated the enzyme activity. Autoantibodies from patients presenting with autoimmune thyroid disorders were essentially directed to epitopes similar or adjacent to those recognized by 8 of the 13 mAb and present on only 2 antigenic domains of hTPO. Taken together these data allowed us to propose a tentative map of the surface of the hTPO molecule which associates its epitopic structure with its biochemical functions.\r"

To determine if thyroid hormones regulate IR-TSH in the rat brain, the effects of T3 and T4 on pituitary and hypothalamic IR-TSH content were studied in intact and hypophysectomized rats. Female rats received daily injections of T3 (0.1, 1.0, or 10 micrograms/100 g BW) or T4 (0.5, 2.5, or 5.0 micrograms/100 g BW) for 7 days. The chronic administration of T3 and T4 decreased the plasma concentration and pituitary content of IR-TSH in a dose-dependent manner. In intact rats, the administration of T3 did not affect the content of IR-TSH in the median eminence, ventral hypothalamus, or dorsal hypothalamus. In contrast, administration of T4 significantly increased the content of IR-TSH in the median eminence and ventral hypothalamus in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, in hypophysectomized rats daily administration of T4 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of IR-TSH in the median eminence and ventral hypothalamus. In hypophysectomized rats infusion of colchicine into the lateral ventricle, which blocks axonal transport, decreased the content of IR-TSH in the median eminence (631 +/- 59 vs. 439 +/- 36 microU/mg), increased the content of IR-TSH in the ventral hypothalamus (45 +/- 5 vs. 87 +/- 10 microU/mg), and blocked the T4-induced increase in IR-TSH in the median eminence. In intact rats, administration of iopanoic acid, which blocks the conversion of T4 to T3, decreased the content of IR-TSH in the median eminence (688 +/- 44 vs. 450 +/- 38 microU/mg) and ventral hypothalamus (103 +/- 16 vs. 70 +/- 5 microU/mg) and blocked the T4-induced increase in IR-TSH in the median eminence (1025 +/- 82 vs. 644 +/- 62 microU/mg) and ventral hypothalamus (229 +/- 23 vs. 117 +/- 11 microU/mg). These data indicate that TSH content in the median eminence and ventral hypothalamus is regulated by a thyroid hormone-sensitive mechanism which requires the local monodeiodination of T4 to T3. In addition, the effect of colchicine on the IR-TSH content in the median eminence and the T4-induced increase in brain IR-TSH are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that hypothalamic IR-TSH is regulated independently of pituitary and serum TSH.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro studies were performed to assess the ability of term human trophoblastic tissue to metabolize 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) and to compare this metabolism to that occurring in porcine renal mitochondria and microsomes. Human trophoblastic homogenates, containing a NADPH-generating system, were able to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] at a rate of 225 pg/mg protein.h, but did not produce detectable quantities (less than 20 pg/mg protein.h) of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24,25-(OH)2D3]. Similarly, mitochondria and microsomes isolated from term human trophoblastic tissue produced 1,25-(OH)2D3 [249 +/- 156 and 199 +/- 82 (mean +/- SD) pg/mg protein.h, respectively] in the presence of an NADPH-generating system, but failed to produce detectable quantities (less than 200 pg/mg protein.h) of 24,25-(OH)2D3. The production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 from the trophoblastic mitochondria and microsomes could be increased by adding 140,000 x g trophoblastic cytosol to the subcellular incubation tubes. This treatment had no effect on the production of 24,25-(OH)2D3. The component(s) present in trophoblastic cytosol responsible for the increased 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by trophoblastic mitochondria and microsomes was shown to be heat labile, trypsin resistant, and less than 1000 mol wt in size. Comparing characteristics of the porcine renal 1 alpha- and 24R-hydroxylase systems with those of the human trophoblastic system revealed that 1) 1,2-dianilinoethane and EDTA totally blocked synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in trophoblastic mitochondria and microsomes, but had no effect on the synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by renal mitochondria; and 2) ketoconazole greatly inhibited the synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 24,25-(OH)2D3 by renal mitochondria, but had no effect on the production of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by trophoblastic mitochondria or microsomes. Finally, production of 24,25-(OH)2D3 could not be demonstrated in trophoblastic homogenates, mitochondria, or microsomes, while the production of this compound was readily evident in renal mitochondria, but not microsomes. The results of this study question the existence of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1 alpha- and 24R-hydroxylase systems in the trophoblastic portion of the human placenta. This study also suggests that 1,25-(OH)2D3 can be produced in vitro by a mechanism other than enzymatic 1 alpha-hydroxylation. The possibility exists that the mechanism involves the insertion of oxygen at the 1 position of 25-(OH)D3 by free radical chemistry.\r"

To investigate the role of these hormones in vivo, we have used in situ hybridization techniques to study GH mRNA regulation in the rat pituitary. The amount of mRNA encoding for GH was dramatically reduced after 1 month of treatment with 6-N-propyl-2-tiouracil. However, daily injections of L-T4 for 10 days restored GH mRNA to control levels. Similarly, adrenalectomy decreased GH mRNA levels, and subsequent daily injections of dexamethasone for 1 and 5 days restored the levels of GH mRNA to those before adrenalectomy. Moreover, 6-N-propyl-2-tiouracil treatment in combination with adrenalectomy dramatically reduced pituitary levels of GH mRNA, which were increased by administration of both thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids. These results show that the effects of thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones on GH synthesis are largely mediated by the hypothalamus. Our results obtained in implanted pituitaries under the kidney capsula demonstrated that these two hormones also exert a smaller effect of GH mRNA directly at the pituitary level.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of an activator of protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), on the 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity was studied in rat astroglial cells cultured in chemically defined medium. TPA promoted a large increase in the type II 5'D activity, which was maximal 5-10 h after addition of TPA and then declined to the basal level at 24 h. The optimal TPA concentration was 10(-7) M. TPA and 8-Br-cAMP, an other inducer of 5'D activity were antagonist. Otherwise, TPA stimulated 5'D activity only in the presence of glucocorticoids at concentrations from 10(-8) M to 10(-4) M. Glucocorticoids alone induced a slight increase in 5'D activity. These data indicate that protein kinase C contributes to the control of 5'D activity in astroglial cells and that its action is dependent on glucocorticoids.\r"

  ".U": "89338236\r", 
  ".W": "It is generally believed that glucocorticoids cause osteoporosis through a combination of decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption. However, the direct effect of glucocorticoids on osteoclasts has not been determined. We therefore tested the effects of hydrocortisone and dexamethasone on bone resorption by osteoclasts disaggregated from neonatal rat long bones. Hydrocortisone and dexamethasone caused a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in the range 10(-7) to 10(-5) M, and 10(-9) to 10(-6) M, respectively, at concentrations likely to occur during therapy and disease. Inhibition of bone resorption was found to be associated with impaired osteoclast survival: osteoclast numbers were reduced to approximately 25% of control values by 10(-6) M hydrocortisone and 10(-7) M dexamethasone. Osteoclast cytotoxicity by glucocorticoids was completely antagonized by progesterone, which itself had no effect on osteoclast survival. Analysis of the time course of these inhibitory effects showed a nonsignificant reduction in survival by 6 h and marked inhibition of survival by 12 h. We could detect no specific changes in osteoclast morphology in association with this impaired viability. The relative potencies of the glucocorticoids for impairment of osteoclast viability was similar to their relative affinities for binding the glucocorticoid receptor, and this, together with inhibition by progesterone, suggests a receptor-mediated mechanism. Such a receptor-mediated cytotoxic action of glucocorticoids has only previously been reported with lymphoid cells. The sensitivity of osteoclasts to the lethal effects of glucocorticoids suggests that glucocorticoids may have a role in physiology as inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption.\r"

It was purified to homogeneity by using a RIA throughout the first three chromatographic steps, then a fast RRA (on rat liver membranes) during the last three purification steps. This new PHI variant was identified as rat PHI-(1-27)-Gly, as judged by full sequencing amino acid analysis after C-terminal digestion by carboxypeptidase-Y and by coelution with synthetic rat PHI-(1-27)-Gly.\r"

After an initially rapid distribution phase, the serum half-lives of both forms of [125I]CBG were essentially identical (approximately 13 h) and did not vary at different gestational ages. There was also no difference in the transfer of either form of [125I]CBG from maternal to fetal compartments in any of the animals studied. Moreover, [125I]CBG showed no sign of degradation and retained its steroid-binding activity in fetal urine and amniotic fluid. Twenty-two hours after administration of [125I]CBG to rabbits (n = 2) at 23 days gestation, its mean level in fetal urine (7 cpm/microliter) and amniotic fluid (2.5 cpm/microliter) was much higher than that in fetal blood (0.6 cpm/microliter). More importantly, the specific activities of [125I]CBG in fetal urine and amniotic fluid were comparable to that in maternal serum, and approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in fetal serum. Taken together, these results suggest that CBG in fetal urine and amniotic fluid is largely of maternal origin, and that maternal CBG crosses the fetal kidney preferentially.\r"

  ".U": "89338243\r", 
  ".W": "A major action of estradiol in the corpus luteum of the pregnant rat is to increase the supply of cholesterol substrate for progesterone production by stimulating both cholesterol synthesis and uptake. To determine whether this steroid also affects cholesterol metabolism and transport, estradiol's action on the expression of cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) and the cholesterol transport protein, sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP2), was examined. Mitochondria isolated from corpora lutea of estradiol-treated rats secreted significantly more progestagen than mitochondria of control corpora lutea. Several findings indicate that estradiol enhances cholesterol transport and availability to the P450scc rather than affects the expression of this enzyme: 1) the difference in mitochondrial progestagen synthesis induced by estradiol was obliterated by the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol; 2) immunoblotting of P450scc indicated no stimulatory effect of estradiol on the amount of enzyme; and 3) levels of P450scc mRNA were not increased by estradiol. Whereas estradiol had no stimulatory effect on P450scc it caused a mark (3-fold) increase in the mitochondrial content of SCP2. Thus, the increase in luteal progestagen synthesis stimulated by estradiol appears to be associated with an increase in mitochondrial SCP2 and is independent of luteal P450 content or message.\r"

  ".W": "The following studies were conducted with the goal of understanding some of the molecular mechanisms by which cAMP alters granulosa cell function. In this regard, we characterized the expression of messages for the cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) enzyme and a type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunit (RII beta) in granulosa cells isolated from small antral follicles and cultured in 1% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. Forskolin (FSK) stimulated cAMP production followed by accumulation of RII beta mRNAs, induction of P450scc mRNA, and, finally, progesterone biosynthesis. The regulation of each mRNA displayed a different sensitivity to actinomycin-D treatment. To determine if the modulation of RII beta or the induction of P450scc could be mediated by the enhancer activity of a cAMP-responsive DNA element (CRE), plasmid DNA containing the CRE and TATA box of the human glycoprotein alpha-subunit (alpha G) gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene was introduced into cultured granulosa or interstitial cells, and the ability of FSK to stimulate the expression of the CAT enzyme was measured. When granulosa cells were isolated from preantral/small antral follicles and maintained for at least 5 days in culture, 5 or 10 microM FSK reversibly stimulated expression of the CAT enzyme within 18 h posttransfection. Under similar conditions, interstitial ovarian cells (prepared from the residual ovarian tissue remaining after granulosa cell isolation) were unable to express the template unless the cells were pretreated for 24 h with FSK before transfection. Thereafter, CAT gene expression by interstitial cells was maintained in a FSK-insensitive manner. To determine if cAMP-dependent transcription of the reporter gene required the same sequences that had been characterized for placenta-derived cells, a truncated plasmid lacking the CRE of the alpha G gene was transfected. Under no condition was expression of the CAT gene observed from a CRE-deficient template. The acute transcriptional activation of a CRE/TATA box-containing gene by cAMP in granulosa cells indicated that transcription-activating proteins interacting with the CRE were either present in these cells or were rapidly synthesized after stimulation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, protein synthesis was transiently inhibited after transfection, before the addition of FSK, by incubating the cells for 2 h with 25 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. Cycloheximide treatment alone did not stimulate transcription from the CRE-containing molecule. Incubation with cycloheximide, followed by treatment with FSK, increased CAT activity 2-fold compared to t\r"

  ".W": "The ovarian level of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) was measured by RIA during ovulation in gonadotropin-primed immature Wistar rats. The ovulatory process was initiated in 25-day-old rats by a 10-IU injection of hCG sc 2 days after the animals had been primed with 10 IU PMSG, sc. Ovarian follicles begin to ovulate 10 h after hCG. At 0 h after hCG, the ovarian 15-HETE level was 0.6 +/- 0.2 ng/mg ovarian protein. At 6 h the 15-HETE level increased sharply to 27.3 +/- 4.2 ng/mg protein and reached a peak of 50.0 +/- 9.8 ng/mg protein at 10 h. Ovarian 15-HETE decreased significantly between 10-16 h after hCG (when ovulation was essentially completed). The pattern of secretion of this 15-lipoxygenase product was reciprocal to the pattern of secretion of leukotriene-B4 by the rat ovary. Ovarian 15-HETE production and ovulation were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner when indomethacin was administered sc 1 h after hCG in doses ranging from 0.10-10.0 mg/rat. In contrast, the synthesis of ovarian prostaglandins-E and -F was inhibited by a dose of indomethacin as low as 0.0316 mg/rat, but this dose did not significantly affect the ovarian 15-HETE level or the ovulation rate. Therefore, the ovulation rate was more closely correlated with the ovarian 15-HETE level (P less than 0.001) than with the ovarian levels of either prostaglandin-E or -F (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05). The results suggest that products of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism may be important in the biochemical events of mammalian ovulation.\r"

Furthermore, immunoblot analysis shows a normal level of the male-specific cytoplasmic androgen-binding protein. Cross-breeding of the NB male and Sprague-Dawley female shows that the hybrid male in the F-1 generation regains the androgen-dependent expression of alpha 2u-globulin in the liver. These results along with the observation of high constitutive level of alpha 2u-globulin mRNA in the preputial gland of NB rats indicate a tissue- and gene-specific regulatory defect which prevents androgenic induction of alpha 2u-globulin in the liver.\r"

CSA-treated animals developed a notable hypertension, along with a striking rise in PRA, which was not coupled with significant changes in the plasma concentrations of aldosterone and corticosterone (hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism). Morphometry showed that zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata, and their parenchymal cells were atrophic. Isolated capsular (ZG) and inner (zona fasciculata/reticularis) cells displayed reduced basal and stimulated secretory responses. However, while the response of ZG cells to angiotensin II was almost completely suppressed (96%), basal steroid secretion of isolated cells, as well as the aldosterone and corticosterone response of ZG cells to potassium and ACTH, and corticosterone production of inner cells in response to ACTH were decreased by only about 30-40%. The hypothesis is advanced that CSA exerts a dual effect on rat adrenal cortex: 1) a general inhibitory effect on the growth and steroidogenic capacity of adrenocortical cells, which manifests itself only after very prolonged treatment and may be caused by an impairment of protein synthesis; and 2) an acute effect involving the specific blockade of the angiotensin-II-induced stimulation of the secretory activity of ZG cells.\r"

One of the biochemical processes stimulated by the ovarian steroid 17 beta-estradiol (E2) that is relevant to reproduction is the induction of OT receptor binding in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). The purpose of these experiments was to determine if E2-induced changes in OT receptor binding in the VMN occur within a time frame relevant to cyclic changes in ovarian steroid secretion. OT receptor binding was measured in the VMN of ovariectomized rats implanted for 0-96 h with E2-containing Silastic capsules. The rate of decay of OT receptor binding was measured in another group of animals 6-48 h after capsule removal. Receptors were labeled with the specific OT receptor antagonist [125I]d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)]OVT, and binding was measured with quantitative autoradiographic methods. In addition, plasma E2 levels and uterine weights were assessed in animals from each treatment condition. Significant increases in E2-dependent OT receptor binding and uterine weight occurred within 24 h of steroid treatment. After E2 withdrawal, OT receptor binding and uterine weight decreased significantly within 24 h. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that steroid modulation of OT receptor binding is necessary for the induction of sexual receptivity.\r"

  ".W": "LH has been shown to be the principal hormone regulating ovarian thecal-interstitial cell (TIC) differentiation. It has been well documented that LH stimulates cAMP production and that cAMP analogs mimick the stimulatory actions of LH, but the mechanisms by which LH and cAMP stimulate TIC differentiation are unknown. The purpose of these studies was to characterize LH-stimulated differentiation of isolated TIC in serum-free medium and examine the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) isoenzymes in TIC differentiation. Highly purified (greater than 90%) TIC which were free from granulosa cell contamination were isolated from collagenase-dispersed ovaries of hypophysectomized immature rats by Percoll gradient centrifugation. When the purified TIC (20,000 viable cells/well) were cultured (2 days) in serum-free medium (0.2 ml in 96-well plates), low levels of steroids were produced. LH stimulated a dose-related (ED50 = 2.6 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) increase (50-fold) in androsterone, the principal androgen produced. LH stimulated an immediate dose-related increase in cAMP production, but there was a 20-h lag before LH stimulated an increase in androsterone production, which reached maximum levels at 30 h. LH-stimulated progesterone production increased immediately to a maximum at 10 h, then progesterone levels decreased as androsterone production increased. To determine the role of PKA in stimulating androsterone and progesterone production, TIC were cultured (2 days) with 8-aminohexylamino-cAMP (100 microM) plus N6-benzoyl-cAMP (30 microM) or 8-thiomethyl-cAMP (30 microM) plus N6-benzoyl-cAMP (30 microM) to directly and selectively activate type I or type II PKA, respectively. Selective activation of either isoenzyme increased androsterone and progesterone production by TIC. Immunoblots revealed that either type I or type II PKA increased the contents of P450scc and P45017 alpha in TIC. This is the first demonstration that direct activation of either type I or type II PKA stimulates TIC differentiation. These results indicate that LH stimulates TIC differentiation by a mechanism mediated by activation of one or both PKA isoenzymes.\r"

Release of these growth factors from calvaria into serum-free medium was quantitated using a human IGF-I RIA and human IGF-II RRA. Untreated calvaria released several-fold more IGF-II than IGF-I. PTH (from 1-12 nM) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in the release of both growth factors that correlated with increased calcium release and was sustained for up to 6 days. IGF-I and IGF-II release were maximally stimulated 5- to 10-fold and 1.5- to 2-fold, respectively, compared to untreated control values. Calcitonin inhibited PTH-stimulated resorption, but had no effect on PTH stimulation of IGF-I and IGF-II release, suggesting that PTH effects on IGF-I and IGF-II release were not dependent on resorption. Furthermore, the amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II released from calvaria during 6 days of culture were 5-fold more than the amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II present in the calvaria (bone plus cells) at the beginning of culture, suggesting that much of the IGF-I and IGF-II released was newly produced by calvaria cells. The results suggest that PTH directly stimulated calvarial osteoblasts to release IGF-I and IGF-II. Since IGF-I and IGF-II stimulate osteoblastic cell proliferation, the effect of PTH on the release of these and other growth factors may mediate coupling of bone formation to bone resorption.\r"

Studies in three additional monkeys in which the order of the oxytocin challenge tests was changed, again showed that the response to oxytocin was greatest in the hours of darkness. We conclude that an underlying, as yet undefined, rhythm exists in the sensitivity of the pregnant primate myometrium to oxytocin at different times of the 24-h day. This change in myometrial sensitivity may be due to variation in one or more of the many potential regulatory sites of oxytocin's action at the cellular level. We hypothesize that this difference in myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin plays a role in the switch from myometrial contractures to contractions that occurs around the hours of darkness, e.g. postsurgery, during food withdrawal, and before delivery.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently identified and purified from fetal liver a distinct receptor that mediates the effects of placental lactogen (PL) on amino acid transport, glycogen synthesis, and somatomedin production in fetal tissues. At present, the factors that regulate the number and affinity of PL receptors in the fetus are unknown. Since maternal nutrition plays a critical role in fetal metabolism and growth, we have examined the role of nutrition in the regulation of the PL receptor in fetal lambs. Pregnant ewes at 123-126 days gestation were fed ad libitum (FED), fasted for 3 days (FASTED), or fasted for 3 days and then refed for an additional 3 days (REFED). The ewes were then killed, and the binding of [125I]ovine (o) PL to hepatic microsomes from the fetal lambs was examined. Maternal fasting caused a 60-75% reduction in the specific binding of oPL to fetal liver; the effect of fasting was reversed in part by refeeding [specific binding per mg protein: FED, 11.8 +/- 2.2% (n = 8); FASTED, 2.8 +/- 0.4% (n = 7); REFED, 7.2 +/- 2.6% (n = 3)]. The decrease in oPL binding resulted from an 80% reduction in the number of fetal oPL-binding sites (Scatchard analysis); there were no changes in the affinity of the oPL receptor (Kd, 0.6 nM), the subunit structure of the receptor, or the degree of occupancy of the receptor in vivo by endogenous fetal hormones. The specific bindings of GH (0.6%), PRL (0.3%), and insulin (35%) to fetal liver were not affected by maternal fasting, indicating that caloric restriction exerted a specific effect on oPL binding in the fetus. The number of fetal oPL-binding sites was positively correlated with the fetal liver glycogen content (r = 0.69; P less than 0.01) and the fetal plasma concentrations of glucose (r = 0.68; P less than 0.01) and insulin-like growth factor-I (r = 0.74; P less than 0.001), suggesting a role for the PL receptor in the regulation of fetal carbohydrate metabolism and growth. The number of fetal PL receptors was inversely correlated with the fetal plasma oPL concentration (r = 0.47; P less than 0.05). These studies demonstrate that fasting of the pregnant ewe reduces the number of PL receptors in ovine fetal liver. The reduction in fetal hepatic PL receptors may contribute to the mobilization and depletion of fetal liver glycogen stores and may play a role in the pathogenesis of the fetal growth retardation that accompanies maternal caloric deprivation.\r"

  ".W": "Mammary epithelial cells obtained from virgin mice were induced to accumulate alpha-casein in serum-free two-stage collagen gel culture with insulin, PRL, and linoleic acid. Omission of either PRL or linoleic acid drastically reduces alpha-casein accumulation. Spermidine addition to insulin-containing medium in either the absence or presence of linoleic acid does not stimulate alpha-casein accumulation. We conclude from this that spermidine can not be the sole mediator of PRL action. Spermidine also will not replace linoleic acid for alpha-casein accumulation if the fatty acid is omitted from the culture medium and will not increase casein accumulation when supplemented into PRL- and linoleic acid-containing medium; thus, it is not the sole mediator of linoleic acid action. However, the spermidine synthesis inhibitor methylglyoxal-(bis)-guanylhydrazone does inhibit alpha-casein accumulation in a concentration-dependent and spermidine-recoverable manner in cells stimulated by PRL and linoleic acid. We could not detect changes in polyamine levels in response to any of the medium supplements used in this investigation. Spermidine is, thus, at least a required comediator of the alpha-casein synthesis induction, although its role remains enigmatic.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that ACTH and PRL stimulate baboon fetal adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) production both in vitro and in vivo and that estrogen diminishes the responsivity of the adrenal to tropic peptides in vitro. In the present study we determined the effects of increasing placental estrogen production by the administration of androstenedione at midgestation on DHA production by the baboon fetus in vivo. Pregnant baboons were untreated (n = 8) or treated (n = 9) with increasing numbers of androstenedione implants inserted in the mother at 8-day intervals between days 70-100 of gestation (term = day 184). On day 100, the fetuses were exteriorized, and a constant infusion of saline (0.1 ml/min) was initiated via a catheter inserted into a femoral vein of the fetus. At 40 min, a bolus injection of either 30 nmol ACTH or 40 nmol ovine PRL was administered to fetuses. ACTH or PRL (0.2 nmol/min.0.1 ml saline) were then infused for an additional 25 min. The concentrations of serum estradiol (E2) in the uterine vein (20.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml; mean +/- SE) and estrone (E1) in umbilical vein (11.9 +/- 3.1 ng/ml) of androstenedione-treated baboons were 2-fold greater (P less than 0.05) than respective values in untreated baboons. Baseline concentrations of DHA in the femoral vein of the fetus were similar in all treatment groups (overall mean, 120 +/- 20 ng/ml) and greater (P less than 0.05) than values (27 +/- 3) in the mother. In untreated control baboons, basal DHA concentrations in the fetus were increased (P less than 0.05) by 69 +/- 17% and 94 +/- 29% after fetal injection of ACTH (n = 4) or PRL (n = 4), respectively. In contrast, neither PRL (n = 5) nor ACTH (n = 4) had any effect on serum DHA when injected into androstenedione-treated baboons. Regardless of treatment, injection of ACTH or PRL into the fetus had no effect on DHA concentrations in the mother. Collectively, these findings indicate that the ability of the fetal adrenal to increase DHA production in response to an acute infusion of ACTH or PRL was abolished in baboons in which placental estrogen production was increased prematurely at midgestation. Therefore, we suggest that during the second half of gestation in the baboon a regulatory system may exist in utero, in which there is feedback control of the placental product estrogen on the formation of the fetal adrenal precursor DHA.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of male and female hypogonadal (hpg) mice with preoptic area (POA) grafts to show negative feedback was studied. GnRH neurons within POA grafts send axons into the median eminence of the hpg host (HPG/POA), resulting in increased gonadotropin production and gonadal development in the mice that are genetically unable to produce GnRH. The present studies evaluated whether negative feedback, an aspect of normal reproductive function, is present in male and female HPG/POA mice. In normal male mice plasma LH was increased 1 or 5 months after castration and returned to baseline after testosterone propionate treatment. In contrast, no alterations in plasma LH were measured in similarly treated HPG/POA males. HPG/POA female mice were ovariectomized 6 weeks or 3 or 6 months after graft surgery and received sc 17 beta-estradiol (E2) implants 3 months later. Normal mice were studied when 6 weeks old and 8 months old (age-matched to HPG/POA mice ovariectomized 3 months after graft surgery). Further, to determine whether the mice were capable of positive feedback, 1 week after receiving E2 implants, mice in the 6-week and 3-month postgraft surgery groups were challenged with sequential administration of estradiol benzoate and progesterone. The significant increase in plasma LH after ovariectomy or decrease after E2 implant in normal female mice was not present in most HPG/POA female mice. Just 2 of the 24 HPG/POA females studied had increased plasma LH after gonadectomy, and in only 1 of these was plasma LH suppressed by E2 treatment. The ability of an individual HPG/POA mouse to show positive feedback did not predict the ability to show negative feedback, nor did the ability to show negative feedback predict positive feedback capability. Among the mice that failed to respond to ovariectomy with increased LH release were some that had elevated LH in response to steroid challenge or had spontaneously ovulated. On the other hand, neither mouse that had increased LH release after ovariectomy had shown positive feedback to a steroid challenge. Immunocytochemical evaluation revealed GnRH cells within the grafts and GnRH fiber innervation of the host's median eminence, but there was no correlation between numbers of GnRH cells or extent of innervation with the ability to show either negative or positive feedback, nor was the presence of vasoactive intestinal peptide cells within the grafts of predictive value. The failure of negative feedback in most of the HPG/POA mice tested may be due to the failure to establish as yet unidentified but essential afferents to the grafted GnRH cells and/or their axonal processes.\r"

After fractionation of serum on Sephadex G-200 at neutral pH, 62% of the immunoreactive IGF-I is recovered in the 150K region, 38% in the 40K region, and none is present as free 7.5K IGF-I. Adult rat serum also contains unoccupied binding sites for IGFs that also are predominantly (77%) located in the 150K region and have preferential binding affinity for IGF-II. IGF-binding protein components in the 150K and 40K regions were evaluated by affinity cross-linking to 125I-labeled IGFs and by ligand blotting (i.e. incubation of nitrocellulose blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gels with [125I]IGFs). Affinity cross-linking of the 150K region revealed a major 43K binding protein complex and several minor covalent complexes of 97-210K that are formed during the cross-linking reaction. The 40K region of the gel filtration column contains a predominant 32K complex and smaller amounts of the 43K complex. Ligand blotting of the 150K region identifies a predominant cluster of binding components of about 40K and a smaller 29K protein. The apparent molecular masses of the 40K and 29K proteins are decreased by incubation with N-glycanase, indicating that they contain N-linked oligosaccharides. These glycoprotein components, designated gp40 and gp29, presumably combine with an acid-labile nonbinding subunit of about 100K to generate the 150K complex. The gp40 cluster represents glycosylation variants of a 34K protein; gp29 has been shown to correspond to an amino-terminal fragment of gp40. Ligand blotting of the 40K region indicates that it contains smaller amounts of gp40 and gp29, possibly representing free subunits not combined with the nonbinding subunit, as well as two proteins of apparent molecular mass 24K and 30K (p24 and p30) that are not glycosylated. Although p30 is similar in size to the binding protein from BRL-3A cells (BP-3A) that is present in fetal rat serum, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of whole and fractionated adult serum with an antiserum to BP-3A indicate that p30 in adult rat serum is an antigenically distinct protein. Serum levels of gp40 and gp29 are decreased by hypophysectomy and are restored by GH treatment; p24 and p30 show similar but smaller changes.\r"

Administration of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) for 6 days restores bone collagen mRNA levels to normal, and a single sc injection of 100 micrograms IGF I results in a 1.9-fold increase of both alpha 1(I) and alpha 2 (I)chain mRNAs after 8 h. Studies with calvaria cells in primary culture and with a bone-derived cell line, PyMS, yielded similar results: IGF I treatment of these osteoblast-like cells for 24 h increased steady state levels of type I procollagen mRNAs. Thus, IGF I appears to contribute to osteoblast mRNA expression for both chains of type I collagen.\r"

Injection of neostigmine (5 x 10(-8) mol) into the third cerebral ventricle in intact rats resulted in increased epinephrine and norepinephrine secretion associated with glucagon secretion. This glucagon secretion was still observed in bilateral adrenalectomized (ADX) rats, although its concentration was significantly lower than that in the intact rats. This glucagon rise was significantly inhibited by ip treatment of ganglionic blocker with hexamethonium. Intraperitoneal injection of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (5 x 10(-7) mol), but not of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (1 x 10(-6) mol), reduced the hyperglucagonemic effect of a subsequent neostigmine injection in intact and ADX rats, although these antagonists did not influence epinephrine or norepinephrine secretion in intact rats. In addition, ip injection of the selective alpha 2-receptor antagonist yohimbine (5 x 10(-7) mol), but not of the selective alpha 1-receptor antagonist prazosin (1 x 10(-6) mol), inhibited the neostigmine-induced glucagon secretion in intact and ADX rats. From this evidence it is suggested that central nervous system-mediated glucagon release is enhanced by alpha 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation by either catecholamines or the autonomic nervous system.\r"

  ".U": "89338279\r", 
  ".W": "The osteoclast is the cell that resorbs bone. It is known to derive from hemopoietic precursors, but analysis of lineage and regulation of differentiation has been hampered by lack of a specific marker that enables identification of cells of osteoclastic phenotype. Previously used markers, such as multinuclearity, that are specific for osteoclasts in bone become less specific in culture. Uniquely among bone and bone marrow cells, osteoclasts possess abundant calcitonin (CT) receptors. We therefore tested the correlation between the generation of bone-resorptive function and the formation of CT receptor-positive cells from hemopoietic tissue in vitro. Without 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], a hormone that induces osteoclastic differentiation in vitro, bone marrow cultures showed very little bone resorption, and only small numbers of CT receptor-positive cells developed. When 1,25-(OH)2D3 was added to the cultures, CT receptor-positive cells developed within 1 day and reached a peak after 7 days. Bone resorption commenced within 2 days of hormone addition. There was a strong parallelism between the cumulative number of CT receptor-positive cells and the extent of bone resorption. The capacity of cultures to generate bone-resorptive activity and CT receptor-positive cells declined progressively when 1,25-(OH)2D3 was added to hemopoietic tissue after a 7- to 21-day hormone-free incubation period. The number of CT receptor-positive cells in these cultures correlated strongly (r = 0.96) with bone resorption. The behavior of these cultures suggests that 1,25-(OH)2D3 acts to induce terminal differentiation of osteoclast precursors present in the cultures, and that precursor cell numbers decreased with increasing time in vitro. All of the CT receptor-positive cells in control cultures and all of those seen shortly after 1,25-(OH)2D3 addition were mononuclear, despite considerable bone resorption; the majority of CT receptor-positive cells remained mononuclear throughout the incubation period. This suggests that mononuclear cells with characteristics of osteoclasts exist that are able to excavate bone. CT receptor-positive cells slightly preceded the development of bone-resorptive function, implying that CT receptors develop before the acquisition of bone-resorptive capacity by osteoclasts. Peritoneal macrophages, blood mononuclear cells, and cells of the J774 macrophage cell line failed to either resorb bone or express CT receptors, even after incubation with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 14 days. These results show a strong and specific correlation between the generation of bone-resorptive cells and CT receptor-positive cells, and suggest that CT receptor express\r"

In this paper we investigated whether season affects the presence of the circadian variation of PRL in the fetal sheep. To that effect we measured plasma PRL concentration every 2 h for 24 h during summer, fall, and winter in three groups of fetal sheep whose gestational ages ranged from 125-133 days. Mean (+/- SEM) fetal plasma PRL concentrations were 352.8 +/- 65.0 ng/ml during summer (n = 6), 98.7 +/- 12.9 during fall (n = 8), and 10.5 +/- 2.6 during winter (n = 4). A 24-h variation of plasma PRL was detected during summer [PRL (ng/ml) = 352.8 + 85.2 cos 15 (t - 18.5); P = 0.007] and fall [PRL (ng/ml) = 98.7 + 26.6 cos 15 (t - 23.6); P = 0.041] but not during winter. The mesor and amplitude of the variation are higher in summer than in fall, and the acrophases differ by 5 h, taking place at dusk in summer and close to midnight in fall. These findings show that in fetal sheep, PRL responds to seasons in utero. The signal triggering this response is most likely photoperiod.\r"

  ".W": "Chromogranin-A, also referred to as secretory protein-I, is a 50K protein found in and secreted by endocrine cells, in which it is costored with the native hormone. Porcine chromogranin-A contains a sequence identical to pancreastatin, a 49-amino acid, C-terminally amidated peptide that has been isolated from porcine pancreas, suggesting that chromogranin-A is the precursor of pancreastatin. Pancreastatin has been found to be a potent inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin release. As it is possible that pancreastatin inhibits secretion from other chromogranin-A-containing tissues in which it may be formed, we tested its action on dispersed porcine parathyroid cells in culture. Secretion of chromogranin-A and PTH was up to 6-fold greater at 0.5 mM Ca2+ than at 3.0 mM Ca2+. Pancreastatin (1 nM) reduced the secretion of both chromogranin-A and PTH at 0.5 mM Ca2+ to approximately the levels found at 3.0 mM Ca2+, but did not affect secretion at 3.0 mM Ca2+. Pancreastatin (0.01-1.0 nM) inhibited secretion of chromogranin-A in a dose-dependent fashion. Preincubation of the cells with pancreastatin was not required for inhibition. Transfer of inhibited cells to medium without pancreastatin led to restoration of secretion within 90 min. Phorbol myristate acetate (1.6 microM) stimulated secretion of PTH and chromogranin-A at 3.0 mM Ca2+, but not at 0.5 mM Ca2+. Pancreastatin reversed this stimulation, demonstrating that its inhibition was independent of Ca2+ concentration. These results are consonant with pancreastatin playing a physiological role in modulation of secretion by the parathyroid and, by extension, other endocrine tissues.\r"

Serum lipoproteins were separated by sequential ultracentrifugation into very low density lipoproteins [density (d) less than 1.006 g/ml], low density lipoproteins (LDL; d 1.006-1.063 g/ml) and high density lipoproteins (HDL; d 1.063-1.21 g/ml). The content of total cholesterol and triglycerides were then determined. Apo A-I, apo B, and apo E were isolated from rat serum and antibodies raised in rabbits. In serum and in lipoprotein fractions, the content of apo A-I, apo-B, and apo E were determined by electroimmunoassay. After hypophysectomy, there occurred a decrease in serum cholesterol and serum levels of apo A-I and apo E, in spite of replacement therapy with T4 and cortisone. Similar changes were also observed in HDL. In contrast, apo B, cholesterol, and triglycerides were increased in LDL. Estradiol treatment had no effect on these changes. Continuous infusion of GH resulted in an increase in cholesterol and apo E in serum and HDL to the levels of intact females. In contrast, GH given twice daily had no effect. Therefore, the sexually dimorphic secretion of GH may be important for the regulation of sex differences in apo E and HDL cholesterol levels. There were no consistent effects of GH treatment on the levels of apo A-I in serum or HDL, but GH treatment resulted in a decrease in apo B and triglycerides in both serum and LDL, regardless of the mode of administration. This suggests that GH regulates the serum and LDL levels of apo B and triglycerides independently of the secretory pattern.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the effect of a dietary deficiency in the essential fatty acids (EFA) linoleic and linolenic acids on the onset of female puberty. EFA deficiency was produced in female rats by means of a semipurified diet and was biochemically documented by analyzing serum and erythrocyte fatty acid levels of more than 30 fatty acids, including all members of the n-6 and n-3 series. Levels of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) and all n-6 derivatives, particularly arachidonic acid, were strikingly reduced. A less pronounced but clear-cut decrease in n-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) was also found. The times of puberty and first ovulation, as assessed by the ages at vaginal opening and first diestrus, were significantly delayed in EFA-deficient rats. The mechanisms underlying this delay appear to reside at both hypothalamic and ovarian sites. Simulation of preovulatory plasma estradiol (E2) levels via implantation of E2-containing Silastic capsules evoked a LH surge 30 h later in control juvenile rats, but not in EFA-deficient animals, indicating a delay in the development of the hypothalamic component of E2-positive feedback in the latter group. This delay appears to be due at least in part to reduced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis, as the ability of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to induce PGE2 release from median eminence nerve terminals was markedly reduced in EFA-deficient rats compared with that in controls. The decrease in hypothalamic PGE2 release was related to the EFA deficiency and not to reduced PG synthase activity, as determined by HPLC analysis of PG synthase products derived from exogenous [14C]arachidonic acid. Basal and hCG-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was also compromised in ovaries from EFA-deficient rats. Depressed gonadal function resulting from the EFA deficiency was further evidenced by a reduced gonadotropin receptor content, a blunted E2 response to hCG in vitro, and an increase in mean serum FSH levels. These results suggest that the delay in puberty resulting from EFA deficiency is due to a reduced availability of arachidonic acid for synthesis of bioactive metabolites. This results in delayed development of both the hypothalamic and ovarian components of the reproductive axis.\r"

Activin-A was found to inhibit the growth of CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary) cells in culture, with an IC50 of 3 ng/ml. The maximal response (50% inhibition) required 3 days of incubation in the presence of 40 ng/ml activin-A, and the inhibitory effect was accompanied by morphological changes. Inhibin (10 ng/ml) partially blocked the inhibition of growth by activin. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta), which is structurally related to activin and inhibin, was a very potent inhibitor of the proliferation of CHO-K1 cells, with an IC50 of 0.2 ng/ml and a maximal effect (70% inhibition) at 2 ng/ml. The combination of high concentrations of both TGF beta and activin-A did not result in a greater inhibitory effect than that observed with TGF beta alone, suggesting an overlapping step in the mechanism of action for both factors. In contrast to the results with CHO-K1 cells, differential effects of activin-A and TGF beta were observed in R2C (rat Leydig cell testicular tumor) cells. Activin-A had only a slight effect on proliferation over a 4-day incubation, but inhibited progesterone accumulation ina concentration-dependent fashion within 12 h. TGF beta, on the other hand, was a potent inhibitor of both growth and steroidogenesis in R2C cells. These studies suggest that activin-A and inhibin may regulate proliferation as well as functions of gonadal cells.\r"

  ".U": "89338288\r", 
  ".W": "In previous studies we have shown that aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450arom) mRNA and protein increase markedly in luteal tissue between days 10-19 of gestation, whereas cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P450 (P450scc) appears to be constitutively maintained regardless of hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy. To identify pituitary and placental hormones that regulate these two P450 enzymes in the rat corpus luteum, serum LH activity and pituitary PRL release were selectively inhibited by administration of LH antiserum (LH-Ab) or CB-154, respectively. Placental hormones were removed by hysterectomy. Hormonal activities were replaced by the administration of hCG, PRL, testosterone (T), or estradiol (E), given individually or in combination. Induction of aromatase mRNA transcripts (3.3, 2.6, and 1.9 kilobases) and protein (54,000 mol wt) between days 10-15 of gestation was blocked by either surgical hysterectomy or LH-Ab treatment. Hysterectomy on day 10 combined with CB-154 abolished not only aromatase mRNA, but also markedly reduced P450scc mRNA (2.0 kilobases) by day 12. Induction of aromatase was partially restored in the day 10-15 hysterectomized rats by treatment with PRL plus E (most effective), PRL plus T, or PRL alone, but not by either T or E alone. Similar results were observed 2 days after hysterectomy (day 12), except that hysterectomy alone caused a transient 3.5-fold increase in P450arom mRNA and protein, most likely due to a transient release of pituitary LH. Aromatase mRNA and protein were also increased in intact pregnant rats treated with hCG between days 10-12. However, no effect of hCG was observed before (days 8-10) or after (days 13-19) midgestation. Likewise, LH-Ab had no effect if given after day 13. Despite hormone-specific regulation of the content of aromatase protein, E biosynthesis in vitro was not strictly related to aromatase enzyme content. We conclude that aromatase mRNA and protein are maintained by PRL at a low level of expression in the first half of pregnancy, can be modulated by LH at midgestation, and are subsequently induced to high levels in the second half of gestation by placental factors (rat placental lactogen-1 and T) and the conversion of T to E in the corpus luteum. P450scc appears to be constitutively maintained. Thus, two P450 genes known to be regulated by LH/cAMP in the rat follicle are controlled by diverse peptide and steroid signal transduction mechanisms in the corpus luteum.\r"

  ".W": "Although factors that regulate cAMP and steroid production in granulosa cells of hen preovulatory follicles have been well studied, much less is known of the mechanisms that control steroidogenesis in the adjacent thecal layer. These studies were conducted to examine the involvement and interaction of cAMP and protein kinase-C in modulating androstenedione output from isolated ovarian thecal cells collected from the second largest preovulatory follicle. Treatment of thecal cells with ovine LH (0.01-100 ng/tube) caused a dose-dependent increase in androstenedione secretion. Although coincubation of cells with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 mM) potentiated the effects of LH on steroid production, cAMP levels increased only in response to the higher doses of LH (10-100 ng/tube). Small but significant increases in cAMP accumulation and androstenedione production were observed in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide (0.1 and 1.0 microM), but not to 100 ng/tube chicken FSH, in the presence of 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Treatment of thecal cells with cholera toxin (0.001-100 ng/tube) or forskolin (0.001-10 microM) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cellular cAMP levels and androstenedione secretion. Thecal cell androstenedione production was also stimulated by the cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP (0.1-1.0 mM). Incubation of thecal cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 0.32-162 nM) or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG; 2.5-126 microM) increased basal steroidogenesis (progesterone and androstenedione production) in the absence of a rise in cAMP levels. By contrast, the stimulatory effects of 1 ng/tube LH on androstenedione, but not progesterone, production were attenuated by the presence of PMA (3.2-162 nM) or OAG (25-126 microM). Only a high concentration of OAG (126 microM) suppressed cAMP accumulation stimulated by LH (50 ng/tube). Phorbol ester treatment (32-162 nM PMA) also inhibited androstenedione production in thecal cells stimulated by the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM), indicating a post-cAMP effect of protein kinase-C activity on steroidogenesis. In contrast to the effects of PMA, phorbol 13-monoacetate (162 nM), a nontumor-promoting analog of PMA which does not activate protein kinase-C, did not alter basal steroidogenesis, nor did it affect androstenedione secretion stimulated by LH or 8-bromo-cAMP. Data from the present studies indicate that the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway can mediate the induction of thecal cell steroidogenesis by extracellular signals (i.e. LH and vasoactive intestinal peptide), whereas activated protein kinase-C can both stimulate and inhibit androstenedione production, depending upon the hormonal environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In addition, weak staining was seen in superficial proximal convoluted tubules in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue. Type I receptor-LI was found in distal convoluted tubules, connecting pieces, and initial cortical collecting tubules of the superficial cortex. Since colocalization of the enzyme and receptor was not demonstrated, the action of 11-DH on type I receptor specificity would, thus, appear to be paracrine rather than autocrine.\r"

  ".W": "The secretory pattern of GH is pulsatile in both man and experimental animals. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the endogenous pulsatility of serum GH on the dynamics of plasma membrane GH binding sites. In order to characterize somatogenic and total specific binding, male rats 45 days old were decapitated at 15-min intervals, and rat liver membranes were prepared. Binding studies were done in parallel with and without excess ovine PRL, 1 microgram/tube. Removal of endogenous ligand was performed by exposing the membranes to 3 M MgCl2. A composite picture of serum GH showed relatively good synchronization of the secretory episodes among the animals. Peak levels of the spontaneous secretion pulse of rat GH were followed by an immediate decrease in free somatogenic binding. Two hours later the binding activity returned to presecretion levels, essentially resetting the cell for another cycle. The kinetics of desaturated somatogenic binding were similar. The occupancy of liver GH somatogenic binding sites was maximal at the time of peak serum GH. High levels of the endogenous hormone caused an immediate sharp down-regulation of lactogenic desaturated binding. Up-regulation of the binding sites occurred about 90 min later. Scatchard analysis showed that binding activity of the membranes was a result of the altered number of binding sites, while the binding affinity remained fairly constant. Thus, the centrally regulated GH secretion in the male rat is complemented by appropriate dynamics of the GH receptor turnover, which in turn recognizes individual pulses and allows individual pulse-related responses to occur.\r"

  ".W": "Rapid turnover of the GH receptor has previously been shown, and its turnover (t1/2) has been estimated to be 30-85 min. In a companion study, we found that lactogenic and somatogenic GH binding sites on rat liver membranes were down-regulated immediately after an episode of GH secretion and reappeared at the plasma membrane in time for the next secretory surge of the hormone. In the present in vivo study, we followed the fate of the down-regulated membrane GH binding sites in the Golgi membranes. Male rats were killed at 1000, 1100, and 1200 h, and their livers were removed for preparation of Golgi membranes. Lactogenic and somatogenic [125I]human GH binding to Golgi membranes was measured. The results of the present study show that Golgi receptors are related to the endogenous pulsation of serum GH. After the GH surge, an increase in the capacity of the lactogenic and somatogenic receptors in the Golgi membranes takes place. Most of these receptors were occupied by ligand and represent, therefore, internalized receptors. Two hours after the GH secretory peak, the occupied receptors had disappeared from the Golgi membranes and appeared in the plasma membrane, suggesting that receptors were recycled to the plasma membrane, awaiting the next GH surge. The following model is proposed: A surge of GH secretion causes immediate down-regulation of the plasma membrane receptors to GH. The receptors that disappear from the plasma membrane are internalized to the Golgi complex. A fraction of the Golgi receptors is recycled to the membrane, along with newly synthesized receptors, awaiting the next GH pulse.\r"

  ".W": "Well confirmed evidence has demonstrated that the cerebellum is an important target of thyroid hormone action during development. Moreover, the presence of nuclear receptors and strong 5'-deiodinase activity in cerebella of adult rats have suggested that this region may continue to respond to thyroid hormones during maturity. Recent autoradiographic observations have focused attention on the cerebellar granular layer, in that [125I]T3 administered iv to adult rats was found to be selectively and saturably concentrated there. To determine the specificity of iodothyronine localization in the granular layer, we have now compared film autoradiographic observations made after iv [125I]T4 and iv [125I]rT3 with those found after iv [125I]T3. The results demonstrated that, as in the case of the latter hormone, labeling within the cerebellar cortex after iv [125I]T4 was both selective and saturable. Moreover, except for a lag in time to resolution and a longer retention time, the distribution of cerebellar radioactivity after iv labeled T4 was qualitatively similar to that seen after iv [125I]T3. However, the ability of T4 to become differentially concentrated in the granular layer of cerebellum was absolutely dependent on its ability to be converted intracerebrally to T3. Thus, pretreatment with ipodate, which blocks brain 5'-deiodinase activity and, therefore, the intracerebral formation of T3 from T4, completely prevented cerebellar granular layer labeling after iv [125I]T4 even though it did not interfere with differential labeling of this region by iv delivered [125I]T3. In the same experiments, propylthiouracil, a potent peripheral, but not central, 5'-deiodinase inhibitor, had no qualitative effect on the distribution of either T4 or T3 in cerebellum. By contrast with the results obtained after administering labeled T3 or T4, brain labeling after iv delivered [125I]rT3 was found to be no different from that produced by markers of cerebral blood flow, which rapidly enter and leave the brain without becoming incorporated into brain cells. This was so even during treatment with propylthiouracil and ipodate, both of which markedly prolonged the normally brief residence time of this iodothyronine in serum and brain. Overall, the autoradiographic results served to highlight the importance of the morphological approach for investigating thyroid hormone action and metabolism in brain. They demonstrated that only T3, whether entering as such from the circulation or formed in situ from T4 (but neither T4 itself nor iv administered rT3) was strongly, selectively, and saturably concentrated in the cerebellar granular layer of adult rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The numerical value of the apparent Kd was two to three times lower in the hypothalami and pituitaries, but not in the harderian glands of the animals from these groups. These results indicate that alterations in receptor numbers and affinity constants may be responsible for the dramatic changes in the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to the negative feedback actions of the gonadal steroids, observed under inhibitory photoperiods and that this effect could be duplicated by late afternoon melatonin treatment.\r"

Samples were obtained in the order of needle biopsy (the order of metal and plastic needle biopsy was randomized), forceps biopsy, followed by salvage cytology. Needle biopsies were obtained by puncturing the lesion under direct vision while aspirating with a syringe. Twenty-three patients with gastrointestinal malignancy were studied (7 esophageal, 4 gastric, and 12 colonic). Forceps biopsies were positive in 18 of 23 (78%), missing 1 gastric and 4 colon malignancies. Metal needle biopsy was positive in 16 of 19 (84%), plastic needle biopsy in 17 of 22 (77%), and salvage cytology in 20 of 22 (91%). Accuracy was increased by a combination of techniques.

However, there is a discrepancy between the findings at autopsy and findings at endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP). To examine this issue, ERP of subjects who were found not to show any abnormality of the biliary and pancreatic ducts were selected. They were divided by decade from 10 to 70 years and for statistical analysis into young (less than 40) and older (greater than or equal to 40) patients. There was no difference in length of the MPD between the two groups. However, the width of the MPD in the head was significantly greater in the older subjects (group 2; mean +/- SD = 3.78 +/- 0.97 mm) compared with those who were less than 40 years (group 1; 2.97 +/- 0.71 mm; p less than 0.001). Similarly, in the midbody the width of the MPD in group 2 (2.86 +/- 0.9 mm) was significantly greater compared with group 1 (2.36 +/- 0.51 mm; p less than 0.02). However, there was no difference in width of the MPD in the tail between the two groups. Length of the accessory pancreatic duct (APD) did not show any alteration with age but width was significantly greater in group 2 (1.94 +/- 0.69) compared with group 1 (1.49 +/- 0.51; p less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the length and width of the MPD or APD between male and female subjects of either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most of the patients were elderly and many had either cardiac or pulmonary disease. All subjects were premedicated with intramuscular meperidine and continuously monitored with ECG, blood pressure, earlobe pulse oximetry, nasal air flow by thermistor probe, and impedance pneumography. Any use of additional analgesic or sedative was determined by the endoscopist, who was blinded to the physiologic tracings, and dosages of medications given were titrated to each patient's tolerance of the procedures as assessed by the endoscopist. Seventeen patients (85%) required additional sedation with the benzodiazepine, midazolam. These patients exhibited frequent episodes of hypotension (reductions in mean arterial blood pressure of 23 +/- 12 mm Hg from baseline, means +/- SD) and respiratory depression (as noted by the greater number of apneas and arterial oxygen desaturation as low as 7.1 +/- 2% from baseline, means +/- SD). In addition, elderly patients and patients with an underlying history of cardiac or pulmonary disease had a greater incidence of potentially untoward cardiorespiratory events.\r"

  ".W": "Based on short recordings, the rectum has been shown to have contractions with a frequency of five to 10 cycles per minute and slow contractions at three cycles per minute. To define anorectal motility over a prolonged period of time, we have studied 12 healthy volunteers using a fine pressure sensitive anorectal probe. A total of 240 hours of recording was obtained. We observed three types of activity in the rectum: (i) runs of powerful phasic contractions with a frequency of two to three per minute, lasting for three to 10 minutes, and recurring to an interval of 92 (1.9) minutes (mean (SEM)) during the day and 56 (1.7) minutes (mean (SEM)) at night, (ii) isolated prolonged contractions lasting for 10-20 seconds and seen mainly during waking, and (iii) clusters of contractions occurring at a frequency of five to six per minute lasting for one to two minutes and seen predominantly during the postprandial period. These clusters of contractions resembled the discrete clustered contractions seen in the ileum, whereas the more powerful and prolonged runs of contractions resembled phase III activity in the small intestine. In contrast, the anal canal showed bursts of contractions which were not temporally related. Our data show that the rectum, like the upper gastrointestinal tract, exhibits periodic motor activity; it remains to be seen whether these two biorhythms are synchronous.\r"

  ".W": "Conventional treatment of pancreatic steatorrhoea in man has been unsatisfactory because 90% of the lipase content of therapy is inactivated by acid in the stomach and large doses of replacement treatment are needed to provide adequate supplementation. An acid stable agent (fungal lipase) was investigated in the treatment of pancreatic deficiency steatorrhoea in 11 pancreatectomised dogs maintained on a fixed dietary intake of fat and treated with pancreatin or fungal lipase. Ten grams (60,000 U lipase) of pancreatin was compared with 400mg (4800 U lipase) of fungal lipase administered with each meal against a no treatment group. There was no significant difference in stool bulk and faecal fat excretion between pancreatin and lipase treated animals. Both groups showed a significant reduction in stool bulk and fat excretion when compared with the no treatment group (p less than 0.01). A markedly diminished treatment volume, in the form of fungal lipase, is as effective in controlling steatorrhoea as pancreatin and may prove to be a potentially valuable therapy for patients with pancreatic insufficiency.\r"

During the first trial at 13 months of age fluid and electrolytes administered by parenteral infusion were decreased as measured by water and faecal electrolyte losses. During the second trial of SMS 201-995 at 19 months fluid and electrolyte input were held constant for 14 days. Stool volume declined from 275 ml/kg to 161 ml/kg. Reductions in output of stool electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-) were accompanied by an increase in urine fluid output and increased excretion of urinary Na+. Subsequent administration of SMS 201-995 for a nine month period was not associated with adverse side effects or an impairment of growth velocity. These findings suggest that SMS 201-995 may be useful therapy in infants with high output diarrhoea as a result of congenital microvillus atrophy.\r"

Aneuploid cells were detected in specimens from six of these patients. Four subsequently developed dysplasia and adenocarcinoma but, in the other two, biopsies had been reported as showing specialised epithelium only, with no apparent dysplasia and no evidence of malignancy on clinical follow up to date. In two of the four patients who subsequently developed carcinoma, aneuploid cells were only found in biopsies showing overt dysplasia or carcinoma but in the two other patients aneuploid cells were present in biopsies taken early in the clinical course before any dysplasia had been identified on the original reports. The presence of aneuploid cells on cytometry of these 'benign' biopsies allowed us, on histological review, to identify areas of atypia which were interpreted as mild dysplasia. In this series aneuploidy was always associated with some morphological abnormality varying from mild dysplasia to frank carcinoma. Aneuploid cells were not shown in material from one patient who had an oesophagectomy for dysplasia or in biopsy material from four patients showing 'indefinite dysplasia'. DNA cytometry combines an objective assessment of epithelial atypia with the advantage of detecting rare cellular aneuploidy and the ability to correlate these events with morphology. It should assist in the more accurate diagnosis of dysplasia and prove useful in identifying those patients with Barrett's oesophagus who are at greater risk of subsequently developing malignancy.\r"

Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to Campylobacter pylori (C pylori) were measured by the ELISA technique. Serum pepsinogen I was also measured. Thirty two children showed histological evidence of gastritis. All had C pylori on microscopy and or culture. Nineteen children showed no histological gastritis nor evidence of C pylori on microscopy, culture and/or urease testing. The IgG and IgA antibody levels to C pylori were significantly higher in C pylori positive children than in the negative group (p less than 0.001). Serum pepsinogen I concentrations were also significantly higher in C pylori positive children than in negative (p less than 0.001). Measurement of IgG antibody levels, combined with serum pepsinogen I estimation, predict the presence of C pylori associated gastritis in children with a sensitivity and specificity of up to 95%. It may be used therefore to predict gastritis and even peptic ulceration in children presenting with non-specific upper abdominal pain.\r"

In this case control study in consecutive prospective outpatients (571 cases and 1074 controls) who had undergone diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and routine biopsies from both antral and body mucosa, we calculated the risk of coexisting active DU and/or GU in different gastritis of the antrum or body and according to grade (superficial gastritis, mild, moderate or severe atrophic gastritis). The risk of coexisting active gastroduodenal ulcer (ulcer in duodenum and/or stomach), as well as the risk of DU or GU, was dependent upon the presence and grade of gastritis in antrum and body mucosa. The risk of coexisting ulcer, as expressed as an age adjusted relative risk (RR) and calculated as odds ratio of gastritis in cases and controls, was significantly increased in the presence of superficial antral and body gastritis (RR = 8.5 (7.0-20.0) in men; RR = 5.8 (3.3-10.2) in women), as compared with the risk of ulcer in subjects with histologically normal mucosa (RR = 1). The risk of ulcer, and the risk of GU in particular, increased further with increasing severity of antral gastritis. In such patients with moderate or severe atrophic antral gastritis the RR of coexisting ulcer even exceeded 20 in men and 10 in women (RR = 25.6 (9.0-72.7) in men; RR = 11.7 (5.9-23.0) in women).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intraoperative studies in two subjects showed that transmission of the impulse was independent of extrinsic nerves and was interrupted by circular myotomy. Characteristics of the reflex were studied in 11 healthy women and 19 women with severe idiopathic constipation. One control subject and two patients did not tolerate the test. In the remainder the stimulus caused a clearly defined fall in internal sphincter pressure. The mean resting maximum anal canal pressure before stimulation was the same in both groups (90 (10) v 104 (7) cm H2O, p = 0.3, controls v patients). The threshold stimulus for relaxation (12 (2) v 14 (1) mamps, p = 0.5), the maximum percent fall in resting pressure (43 (7) v 46 (4)%, p = 0.7) and the lowest absolute resting pressure produced by stimulation (48 (13) v 49 (6) cm H2O, p = 0.9) were the same in both groups. The stimulus required to achieve maximum relaxation was significantly higher in the patient group (23 (3) v 32 (2) mamps, p = 0.012) suggesting abnormal intrinsic innervation of the sphincter in these patients. Electrical stimulation should not replace balloon distension for routine testing of the rectoanal reflex but it may be useful in quantitative studies.\r"

There was no significant differences between 16 treated coeliacs (1.24 (0.28) mU/ml) and 30 normal controls (1.63 (0.42) mU/ml). To evaluate the connection between serum and mucosal TG activity we used the experimental model of methotrexate induced acute hypoplastic enteropathy in the rat. Transglutaminase activity was unchanged in serum and mucosa 24 and 48 hours after MTX administration, but increased in mucosa (2.606 (0.95) v basal 0.207 (0.026) mU/mg protein, p less than 0.001) and significantly decreased in serum at 72 hours (2.08 (0.38) v basal 5.56 (1.50) mU/ml, p less than 0.001) during intestinal cell proliferation. Activity of the enzyme in the mucosa and serum returned to baseline levels within 120 hours. This experimental animal model helps to explain the data of TG activity in human intestinal mucosa and serum reported in this study. Results are mean (SD).\r"

The mechanisms involved are relevant to tissue renewal in adult organs yet they have not been elucidated because of the lack of appropriate in vitro models. In this study, we have investigated the interaction between intestinal mesenchymal and epithelial cells at the cellular level in vitro. Fetal rat intestinal epithelial cell colonies explanted in vitro on the 15th day of gestation, which failed to mature in plain monocultures, were reassociated in coculture with three different types of mesenchyme:fetal skin, gastric and intestinal mesenchyme. Only fetal epithelial cells cocultured with intestinal (homologous) mesenchyme acquired definite signs of differentiation within three to six days. These primitive epithelial cells were shown by electronmicroscopy to become highly polarized, connected by tight junctions and covered with a regular brush border. Three brush border enzymes were strongly expressed in homologous cocultures and their activity was sensitive to dexamethasone. In contrast, fetal epithelial cells cocultured with skin or stomach derived mesenchyme under identical conditions failed to differentiate in vitro: they remained flat, unpolarised and expressed only low enzyme activity. The unique potential of the small intestinal mesenchyme to promote intestinal epithelial differentiation is discussed.\r"

Digoxin was metabolised to DRP by 28 (13.7%) of 204 healthy south Indians in contrast to 67 (36.0%) of 186 New Yorkers (p less than 1 X 10(-6)). Only 1.0% of Indians compared with 14.0% of Americans excreted large amounts of metabolites (greater than 40% DRP) in the urine (p less than 1 X 10(-5)). Of 104 urban Indians, 23 (22.1%) were metabolisers, in contrast with five of 100 rural villagers (p less than 0.001). Within the urban group, digoxin metabolism correlated with education, frequency of animal protein intake, and most significantly, personal income. Organisms capable of reducing digoxin in vitro were found with similar frequencies in stool cultures from Indians and Americans. In the cultures of some subjects, DRP production was inhibited at lower dilutions but expressed at higher dilutions. We conclude that variations in drug metabolism between population groups may result from differences in the metabolic activity of the anaerobic gut flora probably mediated by environmentally determined factors.\r"

Coadministration of lactulose and sulphazalazine to nine subjects with assessment of orocaecal transit time by hydrogen breath determination and plasma sulphapyridine assay gave orocaecal transit times of 2.33 and 2.25 hours respectively suggesting that the lactulose reduces transit time and that the lactulose/breath hydrogen method, which is so convenient to use, gives artificially low transit times.

The survey included all patients with CD seen between 1979-1983. The duration of disease ranged from less than one year to 48 years. Of the 210 patients with CD, 118 (56%) underwent surgical resection. Sixty one had an ileocaecal resection, 14 a proctocolectomy, in seven cases as a two stage procedure; 12 a segmental colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis and eight a subtotal colectomy with ileostomy. Twenty-one of these 118 patients (18%) had recurrences requiring reoperation; in 11 because of recurrence at the anastomotic site. Life table analysis showed that after 10 years 17% of patients required further resection for recurrence and 8% for relapse. By 20 years the rate of recurrence had risen to 56%. Patients over the age of 30 at first resection were at 1.5 fold greater risk of requiring further surgery than younger patients. The initial site of disease played no role in recurrence and there was no evidence that preoperative disease duration, delay in diagnosis, or late surgery had any effect on recurrence rates. This is one of the few community based studies to measure recurrence and relapse. A balanced appraisal is that surgery is not permanently curative, but the need for further resection may be lower than previously suggested.\r"

Fifty seven per cent of the patients had not recovered. This group at the outset had more frequent soiling episodes, more severe constipation, were less likely to defecate water filled rectal balloons and to relax the external sphincter during defecation. In general girls had more severe constipation, abdominal pain, and a previous urinary tract infection than boys. Girls were more compliant during treatment and had less frequent soiling episodes at one year. Stepwise logistic regression showed that severe constipation, abnormal contraction of the external sphincter and pelvic floor during attempted defecation, and inability to defecate the 100 ml balloon in less than or equal to 1 min was significantly related to treatment failure. Defecation of smaller balloons, volumes for threshold of rectal sensation, critical volume and rectal contraction, and compliance with treatment could not predict treatment failure.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, propranolol administration reduces heart rate and cardiac output and diminishes portal pressure and collateral blood flow. However, there is little information on the possible effects of propranolol on hepatic artery blood flow. The present study addressed this question in 12 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunt, in whom all of the liver blood flow represents the hepatic artery blood flow. Hepatic artery blood flow (continuous infusion of indocyanine green), cardiac output (thermal dilution), heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured before and 20 min after the intravenous infusion of 10 to 15 mg of propranolol. beta-Adrenergic blockade caused a significant reduction of cardiac output (from 9.1 +/- 2.1 to 7.1 +/- 1.4 liters per min, p less than 0.001) (mean +/- S.D.) and heart rate (from 85 +/- 10 to 71 +/- 7 beats per min, p less than 0.001), and a significant increase of systemic vascular resistance (from 9.0 +/- 2.1 to 11.7 +/- 2.7 mmHg per liter per min, p less than 0.001), whereas mean arterial pressure did not change (77 vs. 78 mmHg). Propranolol significantly reduced hepatic artery blood flow (from 0.65 +/- 0.20 to 0.55 +/- 0.14 liters per min, p less than 0.01). However, reduction of hepatic artery blood flow (-12.9 +/- 7.3%) was significantly less than reduction of cardiac output (-21.1 +/- 5.2%, p less than 0.01). As a result, the fraction of the cardiac output delivered to the liver was significantly greater after propranolol (8.0 +/- 1.7%) than before (7.3 +/- 1.7%, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of alcoholic liver disease with propylthiouracil is based on its effect of suppressing the ethanol-induced increase in hepatic oxygen consumption. It has been postulated that liver necrosis ensues when the increase in oxygen demand by the liver exceeds oxygen delivery to this organ. Data are now presented which show that propylthiouracil also increases portal blood flow in awake, unrestrained rats. Liver blood flow was determined using the labeled microsphere technique in rats at various intervals (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0 and 24 hr) after oral propylthiouracil (50 mg per kg). Administration of propylthiouracil (dose range: 6.25 to 100.0 mg per kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in portal blood flow when given either orally or intraarterially. Maximal flows were obtained with 50 mg per kg (controls = 37.8 +/- 1.5, oral propylthiouracil = 50.7 +/- 2.2 ml.kg-1.min-1). This increase in portal blood flow was accompanied by a decrease in preportal vascular resistance (controls = 2.61 +/- 0.16; propylthiouracil, 50 mg per kg = 1.79 +/- 0.09 mmHg per ml.kg-1.min-1). These effects were correlated with the plasma concentrations of propylthiouracil (r = 0.67, n = 68, p less than or equal to 0.001). The effect of oral propylthiouracil (50 mg per kg) on portal blood flow started at 0.5 hr and lasted for 6 hr after administration, whereas total liver blood flow was increased for 3 hr. Oral propylthiouracil (50 mg per kg) for 5 days resulted in a 53% increase in thyroid weight, an 85% reduction in 125I thyroid uptake and a 74% decrease in serum thyroxine concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89339392\r", 
  ".W": "We conducted a randomized controlled hemodynamic study to evaluate the effect of placebo and 20 mg isosorbide-5-mononitrate, a long-acting organic nitrate, in 19 patients with HBsAg-positive cirrhosis by the simultaneous measurement of portal venous pressure and wedged hepatic venous pressure. Baseline values for the two groups were similar. One hour after oral administration of 20 mg isosorbide-5-mononitrate in 10 patients, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased from 92 +/- 13 (mean +/- S.D.) to 82 +/- 14 mmHg, from 12.9 +/- 4.5 to 9.3 +/- 2.4 mmHg and from 6.9 +/- 3.4 to 4.3 +/- 1.8 mmHg, respectively. However, both portal venous pressure gradient (from 18.1 +/- 3.6 to 17.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg) and hepatic venous pressure gradient (from 17.8 +/- 5.2 to 16.6 +/- 5.3 mmHg) remained unchanged during the study. In six patients who received 20 mg isosorbide-5-mononitrate twice daily for 7 days, hepatic venous pressure gradient remained unaltered as compared to basal and 1-hr values. There was no significant change in cardiac index, heart rate or systemic vascular resistance in either immediate (1-hr) or delayed (7-day) studies. Three patients (30%) developed mild headache or dizziness and two patients (20%) demonstrated systolic hypotension (less than mmHg) during the immediate study. This study shows that isosorbide-5-mononitrate appears to have no effect in treating portal hypertension in patients with HBsAg-positive cirrhosis. In addition, the isosorbide-5-mononitrate may affect the systemic circulation more than the portal circulation.\r"

  ".U": "89339395\r", 
  ".W": "Responses of isolated perfused rat liver to leukotriene C4 were studied in order to assess the mechanisms involved in leukotriene-mediated liver injury. Infusion of leukotriene C4 (11 and 44 pmoles per min per gm liver weight) into the portal vein resulted in a rise in portal pressure, a decrease in oxygen consumption, an increase in hepatic glucose and lactate efflux and lactate/pyruvate ratio in the perfusate and a small decrease in bile flow. Isoproterenol (1 microM) counteracted the effects of leukotriene C4 on respiration and portal pressure, whereas bile flow and glucose efflux were reversibly stimulated. The same changes were observed upon withdrawal of leukotriene C4. The release of glucose was correlated with the increase in oxygen consumption upon both isoproterenol addition and withdrawal of leukotriene C4. These results are indicative of leukotriene C4-induced microcirculatory redistribution of perfusate flow. Since, in the presence of nitroprusside (50 microM), both the effects of leukotriene C4 and their reversal by isoproterenol were diminished, a vascular site of action can be assumed. Accordingly, the accompanying metabolic responses can be explained by gradual changes in oxygen supply to parts of the liver. Reversibility of the leukotriene C4 effects and lack of short-term impairment of viability of the isolated liver suggest that leukotriene-mediated liver injury is a long-term effect related to events subsequent to microcirculatory changes.\r"

Based on data which suggest that barbiturates can be of value in controlling the intracranial hypertension of head injury, intravenous thiopental was assessed in 13 patients with fulminant hepatic failure. All had developed acute renal failure complicated by intracranial hypertension unresponsive to other modes of therapy and were likely by all published criteria to have little chance of survival. The dosage of thiopental was adjusted incrementally until intracranial pressure, measured by extradural transducers, fell to within normal limits or adverse hemodynamic changes occurred. The intracranial pressure was reduced, in each case, by 185 to 500 mg (median: 250 mg) thiopental given over 15 min, and in eight cases continuing infusion achieved stable normal intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Five of the patients made a complete recovery and there were only three deaths from intracranial hypertension. Side effects were few and included minor hypotension controlled by dose reduction. The response of otherwise intractable intracranial hypertension and the 38% survival rate was remarkable for a group of patients with such a poor prognosis.\r"

Ammonia levels in blood increased approximately 3-fold; in brain, liver and muscle the increases were 36, 34 and 50%, respectively. Urea levels in blood and urea excretion increased approximately 2-fold. There was no increase of carbamyl phosphate synthase. Liver glutamine synthase activity increased by 58% and glutamate dehydrogenase by 40%, whereas glutaminase was not affected. Glutamine content in brain was twice that of controls. This new animal model to study hyperammonemia offers several advantages over others: it is simpler, is bloodless, requires no animal manipulation and permits long-term studies.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three staff members serving in a hemodialysis unit were exposed accidentally to needlestick contaminated with blood containing hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen, as well as high levels of DNA polymerase activity (greater than 100 cpm). They received hepatitis B vaccine (20 micrograms) simultaneously with hepatitis B immune globulin (5 ml, 200 IU per ml) within 48 hr after the exposure, and the vaccination was repeated at 1 and 3 months. The protective efficacy was compared with that in a past study in the same unit in which 33 members were given hepatitis B immune globulin alone within 48 hr after the exposure to blood with similarly high levels of DNA polymerase activity. No differences were noted in age or sex between the staff members who were vaccinated and those who were not, nor were there any differences between their inocula in the titers of hepatitis B virus markers. During 12 months after the accident, only one (4%) of the 23 vaccinated members contracted hepatitis B virus infection, at a frequency significantly lower than 11 (33%) of the 33 members who did not receive vaccine (p less than 0.02). These results indicate that hepatitis B vaccine, when given in combination with hepatitis B immune globulin, is efficacious for postexposure immunoprophylaxis of accidental infection.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of iron were studied in cultured chick embryo liver cells to help elucidate the effect of hepatic iron in the human disease porphyria cutanea tarda and in toxic porphyria caused by chemicals. These cultures have proven useful because (a) phenobarbital and phenobarbital-like drugs induce a common form(s) of cytochrome P-450 (P-450-phenobarbital) in these cultures; (b) 20-methylcholanthrene and certain other polycyclic hydrocarbons induce a different form(s) (P-450-methylchol-anthrene), and (c) uroporphyria can be produced rapidly by exposure to suitable chemicals. In these cultures, treatment with iron alone did not produce porphyrin accumulation, and treatment with iron + 5-aminolevulinate caused accumulation of protoporphyrin, as did treatment with 5-aminolevulinate alone. However, treatment with phenobarbital-like drugs and iron, the latter at a concentration as low as 0.2 microM, led to accumulation of uro- and heptacarboxylporphyrins. Potentiation of uroporphyrin accumulation by iron began before there was a detectable synergistic increase in activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the rate-controlling enzyme of heme synthesis. In contrast, treatment of cultures with 20-methylcholanthrene, in the presence or absence of iron, did not result in uroporphyrin accumulation or an increase in the activity of 5-aminolevulinate synthase. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity was unchanged by drug and iron treatments. Inhibitors of P-450-phenobarbital, SKF525A and piperonyl butoxide, as well as cadmium and cycloheximide prevented the porphyrin accumulation produced by glutethimide + iron, even though, except with cycloheximide, these substances further increased 5-aminolevulinate synthase activity. In vitro, uroporphyrin was oxidized autocatalytically by iron. In intact hepatocytes, even low concentrations of iron (0.2 to 20 microM), in the presence of a form of cytochrome P-450 induced by phenobarbital-like chemicals, produces uroporphyria primarily by enhancing uroporphyrinogen oxidation, not by inhibition of the decarboxylase. Induction of 5-aminolevulinate synthase amplifies the porphyrin overproduction.\r"
