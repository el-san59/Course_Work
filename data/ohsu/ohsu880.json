  ".W": "A 61-year-old man who received a porous-metal-coated knee implant returned eight months later with chronic synovitis, instability, and loosening of his artificial joint. Subsequently, metal beads were detected in the joint space and soft tissues and were also embedded in the articulating surface of the tibial component. There was scoring of the tibial surface, and polyethylene wear particles were noted in the synovial and fibroconnective-tissue membranes, which had formed beneath the tibial component. Many particles were seen inside giant cells and macrophages. Failure in this case was probably accelerated by the granulomatous response in the soft tissue to wear particles. There was osteolysis rather than new bone growth at the interface with the tibial component. Analysis indicated that poor bead-bonding strength may have initiated the problem. Careful appraisal of the outcome from use of beaded porous-metal-coated devices and assurance of their adequate bonding strength are essential for further progress.\r"

  ".U": "90367366\r", 
  ".W": "Communication among individual cell types that populate connective tissues such as cartilage or bone is of critical importance in determining the phenotypic properties of these tissues under both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Cytokines, which may be defined as soluble products released from one cell that can modulate the activity of other cells, play a critical role in this process of cell communication. The introduction of molecular biologic techniques has permitted identification of specific cytokines previously characterized on the basis of biologic activities. Cloning and sequencing of these products have provided formal evidence for their existence and allowed identification of the full spectrum of their biologic activities. These results have established that individual cytokines may have multiple biologic activities and that multiple cytokines share common functional properties. Based on these results, the term \"cytokine\" has been used more generally to include products originally described as growth or differentiation factors, e.g., interleukins, monokines, or lymphokines. Cytokines have an important role in the initiation and control of skeletal tissue growth and development and in regulating bone remodeling in the adult organism. As in other connective tissues, these effects are mediated via paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine mechanisms. In skeletal tissues, cytokines may modulate the activity of resident cells by an additional mechanism. Factors produced locally within bone or arriving via the circulation are incorporated into the mineralized bone matrix, and their release during skeletal remodeling could provide the basis for coupling the activity of bone resorbing and forming cells. The principal cytokines that have been shown to affect skeletal tissues include factors previously described as monokines or lymphokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factors (TNF-alpha and TNF-beta), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma); the colony-stimulating factors; and the so-called growth and differentiation factors including transforming growth factors-alpha and -beta (TGF-alpha and TGF-beta), insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Although the effects of the individual cytokines are diverse, it is possible to classify individual factors based on their effects on specific aspects of bone formation or resorption. Significant progress has been made recently toward elucidating the mechanisms of action of the cytokines. Binding studies using radiolabeled ligands have characterized the specific cell surface receptors and defined their distribution and properties among skeletal tissue cells. Various so-called signal transduction pathways have been implicated in mediating these effects...\r"

  ".W": "The results of two collective studies on congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) from a number of hospitals are reported here, including general trends in the Federal Republic of Germany and the author's personal methods and preferences. In the first collective study group, the rate of ischemic necrosis in open reductions was 8.2% for anterolateral approaches, 9.6% for inguinal, 16.7% for Ludloff's operation, and only 5.5% when shortening osteotomy was combined with open reduction. A simultaneous Salter osteotomy or acetabuloplasty increased the rate to 10.3% and a concomitant varus osteotomy to 22.2%. The author prefers an inguinal approach to the hip joint, first laterally and then medially of the iliopsoas muscle and femoral nerve, for optimal visualization of the acetabulum. Stability of the joint is increased by a girdle-like flap from the dorsolateral capsule, which is drawn anteriorly and prevents dorsal redislocation. Acetabuloplasty should also be used, even during the first year of life, in joints in which stability may only be guaranteed by extreme abduction and internal rotation. Salter's and Pemberton's osteotomies are used in Germany with good results. However, the author prefers a lateral Albee-Lance acetabuloplasty modified to a complete osteotomy for lateral levering of the acetabular roof. Long-term results show measurements between 82% and 93% of normal and slightly pathologic values. Simultaneous or single varus osteotomies lead to subcapital coxa valga and should no longer be used routinely. In adolescents and adults up to 45 years of age, as long as osteoarthritis is not too advanced and the femoral head is not too deformed, triple pelvic osteotomy with the author's type of modification has a number of advantages.\r"

The scientific organization Arbeitgemeinschaft fur Rheumaorthopadie (Association for Rheumatic Orthopedics) is an official section of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Orthopedics and Traumatology) and has very close connections with the European Rheumatoid Arthritis Surgical Society. There are many common activities within this group, especially regarding uniform documentation, which began with the elbow. Furthermore, there are standardized procedures in operative synovectomy, including new trends, e.g., arthroscopic synovectomy. Another special interest is focused on alternatives to endoprosthetic replacement, in particular on resection interposition arthroplasty. With regard to endoprosthetic replacement, the question of cementing or not is controversial; however, there are strong arguments for cementless fixation, especially for hip endoprostheses. Arthritis surgery in Germany reflects modern trends all over the world where rheumatology is a subspecialty bridging the gap between internal medicine and orthopedics.\r"

Although an artificial hand only represents a relatively modest substitute for the missing hand of human beings, the efforts of designers and the achievements of manufacturers should not go unnoticed. Because of the development of myoelectrically controlled prosthetic arm, the amputee's standard of function can be improved and a cosmetic and functional solution provided. For control of the electromechanical hand, muscular potentials are received from the residual limb surface, amplified in the electrodes, and transmitted as control signals to the distal area. An important factor in providing a successful fitting is a reliable man-machine connection. This article summarizes the historic development and state of the art of the myoelectrically controlled arm prosthesis. The components and technical evaluations of the Myobock system as well as the procedures for fitting and fabricating a below-elbow prosthesis have been improved recently. A critical analysis of adaptive hands suggests that the prospects for the future are good.\r"

  ".W": "Massive localized osteolysis around artificial joints has been seen more frequently in the past few years. It is still not generally accepted that ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear particles can induce massive bone resorption, even distant from the joint. This article describes a series of eight soft-top prostheses with large UHMWPE ball heads that contributed to the erosion of surrounding bone. Roentgenographically, all of the cases showed a marked loss of proximal cortical bone, more or less combined with osteolysis, which was distal to the femoral shaft and deep into the acetabulum. In two cases, remodeling and resorption transformed the bone into a tumorlike appearance. Tissue samples from areas of osteolysis as well as from the joint capsule were taken at revision surgery, processed for histology, examined microscopically, and evaluated semiquantitatively. The retrieved devices were also carefully inspected. Large amounts of UHMWPE wear debris were found not only in the joint capsule but also in layers of granulomatous tissue from the acetabulum and femur, whereas metal particles and fragmented polymethylmethacrylate were either completely absent or occurred only in very small amounts. The results of this study demonstrate that UHMWPE wear products alone can cause massive osteolysis by triggering foreign-body granuloma formation at the bone-cement interface; the bone cement may remain fixed in areas beyond the osteolytic transformation.\r"

Nicardipine hydrochloride, a Ca channel-blocker for iv use, was compared with placebo. Patients were initially randomized to receive nicardipine infusion or placebo. Those not responding to placebo were given nicardipine infusion on an open basis. Hypertension was significantly better controlled in patients treated with nicardipine infusion compared with placebo (83% vs. 22%, p less than .002). Subsequently, six (86%) of seven of the placebo failures were successfully treated with nicardipine. There were no significant complications in either group. We conclude that the titratable infusion of nicardipine is an effective and safe method for the control of POH after surgery of the head and neck. Further studies are now warranted comparing nicardipine with other drugs currently used to treat this condition.\r"

  ".W": "The testing of gastric pH in the ICU has become the standard of care for most critically ill patients. It has been demonstrated that maintaining a gastric pH of greater than 3.5 confers protection from upper GI bleeding, while lesser pH values subject the patient to hemorrhagic risk. We compared nasogastric pH, as measured by pH electrode, to color-scaled pH paper in 16 critically ill patients hospitalized 3 to 10 days in the surgical ICU. Statistical analysis of 370 gastric specimens revealed a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 94.5% when a paper pH (pH[p]) of greater than or equal to 4 was used as the therapeutic end-point. The sensitivity and specificity of the same pH(p) for clear buffered solutions were 100%. We conclude that the use of pH(p) lacks the clinical accuracy for determining the effects of therapy for the prophylaxis of stress gastritis and will lead to a significant degree of undertreatment. This lack of accuracy is not due to observer error or the quality or age of the testing paper. Our results suggest that if the measurement of gastric pH by pH(p) analysis is to be used as a guide for the prevention of stress-related hemorrhage, a more accurate method of monitoring may be warranted.\r"

This flow-regulated CPAP (FR-CPAP) system delivers a basal flow and also regulates this flow every 20 msec to match the patient's flow demand. To evaluate the performance of this FR-CPAP system, we compared the imposed work of breathing of the FR-CPAP and continuous flow CPAP (CF-CPAP) systems. A model lung was used to simulate spontaneous breathing. The imposed work of breathing of the FR-CPAP system was less than that of the CF-CPAP system. These results indicate that the FR-CPAP system could minimize the imposed work of breathing of a patient receiving CPAP.\r"

Eosinophils and mast cells were increased in BAL in asthmatic subjects; eosinophils were positively correlated with neutrophils and mast cells. Epithelial shedding was present in nine asthmatic and five control subjects. Intraepithelial cells and cells in submucosa were increased in asthmatic subjects. Eosinophils and intraepithelial mast cells were higher. Thickened basement membrane was associated with more marked cell infiltration in submucosa. Ciliated cells in BAL relate to intraepithelial cells; cells in BAL broadly reflect cell infiltration of submucosa. In the asthmatic group, the degree of bronchial responsiveness correlated with ciliated cells in BAL and with intra-epithelial cells in BB. Marked airway inflammation is associated with stable asthma; inflammatory changes within bronchial epithelium may be linked to the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

The design included prospective measurement of the serum-effusion albumin gradient and Light's criteria in patients with pleural effusions in an inpatient ward in a military teaching hospital. Fifty-nine consecutive patients with pleural effusions who were undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic thoracentesis in whom the etiology of the effusion could be determined were studied. Serum and pleural effusion fluid chemistries were measured in order to determine both the serum-effusion albumin gradient and Light's criteria. Using an albumin gradient of 1.2 g/dl or less to indicate exudates and greater than 1.2 g/dl to indicate transudates, 57 of the 59 patients (41 exudates; 18 transudates) were correctly classified. Two patients with malignant effusions were misclassified as having transudates. Although Light's criteria correctly identified all of the exudates, five patients with congestive heart failure were misclassified as exudates. Four of these patients had had previous diuretic therapy, and all had a clinical response to further diuretic therapy. We conclude that although Light's criteria for exudates are very sensitive, an albumin gradient of 1.2 g/dl or less tends to be more specific, especially in cases of chronic congestive heart failure.\r"

Of the 132 patients, 101 were pathologically evaluated and studied in this article. A GF-UM2 radial scanner with 7.5-MHz (Olympus Co Ltd) was used for image examination. The lymph nodes were diagnosed as positive for metastasis when they had thickened images, clear contours, and low echoing images of fusion or lobulation. The results obtained from 509 sites were as follows: sensitivity, 53.6 percent; specificity, 97.5 percent; positive predictive accuracy, 77.1 percent; negative predictive accuracy, 93.1 percent; and overall accuracy, 91.6 percent. The sensitivity rate was 80.6 percent excluding the result of the right superior mediastinal lymph nodes that were difficult to examine for anatomic reasons. Although EUS was considered to be an excellent method in diagnosing lymph node metastases, it had a blind angle in the field. More accurate diagnoses of mediastinal lymph node metastases could be achieved by using EUS and computed tomography (CT) together.\r"

Seventeen of the 23 patients had their tracheostomies closed. This included three patients with no significant free time except with the use of glossopharyngeal breathing. Seven of the 25 patients who used NVA for at least one year with no significant free time have employed NVA for a mean of 7.4 +/- 7.4 years (1 to 22 years). Mouth IPPV was the most common form of NVA used both during the daytime and overnight. The wrap ventilators, intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator, and GPB were also employed for long-term respiratory support.

  ".W": "To determine whether the involvement of thromboxane A2 in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is specific to asthma, we examined the effects of a selective inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase (OKY-046) and a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) on bronchial responsiveness to methacholine in normal subjects and patients with chronic bronchitis, diffuse bronchiectasis, and intrinsic bronchial asthma. The provocative concentration of methacholine producing a 20 percent fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (PC20-FEV1) was measured before and after oral administration of OKY-046 (2,600 mg over four days) and indomethacin (450 mg over three days) in ten normal, ten bronchitic, nine bronchiectatic, and eight asthmatic subjects, respectively. Baseline values of FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not altered by OKY-046 or indomethacin. The geometric mean value of PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 1.78 to 4.27 mg/ml after OKY-046 in asthmatic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or bronchiectatic subjects. On the other hand, PC20-FEV1 increased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 2.19 to 8.13 mg/ml after indomethacin in bronchiectatic subjects, but not in normal, bronchitic, or asthmatic subjects. We conclude that the involvement of thromboxane A2 in BHR may be specific to asthma, and bronchial responsiveness of bronchiectasis may be potentiated by inflammatory release of bronchoconstrictor prostaglandins except for thromboxane A2. Further studies using thromboxane A2 receptor antagonists are needed to confirm the conclusion.\r"

The diagnosis is suggested by the triad of chronic dysphagia, hematemesis, and acute neurologic signs. There may be cardiac manifestations such as pericarditis, atrial fibrillation, or shock. An unusual feature of these fistulas is systemic embolization of food, air, or septic necrotic debris which may result in sudden central nervous system symptoms. All reported cases resulted in death due to hemorrhage, although there was often a variable time interval between the onset of hematemesis and the patient's death. The authors report two additional cases in which an episode of pericarditis preceded fistula development. Based on these 18 cases, the spectrum of esophagoatrial fistulas is reviewed, as well as the signs which may herald fistula development.\r"

Cardiac metabolism is also affected by several factors. Under normal physiologic conditions, the demand is easily met by the supply of oxygen. In fact, there is a significant reserve on the supply side. Under certain pathologic states such as coronary artery disease, the supply of oxygen may be exhausted and an imbalance between supply and demand occurs which is translated into ischemia. The area of myocardium most susceptible to ischemia is the subendocardium due to mechanical and metabolic forces. In therapy of coronary artery disease, attention should be directed to directional changes in factors influencing supply and demand to improve blood flow to the most susceptible area.\r"

The number of neutrophils, the NCA as well as the contents of C5 and C5a des Arg (neutrophil chemotactic factors) in the BAL fluids from both these regions decreased during treatment. These findings suggest that plasma cell granuloma was due to chronic immune and inflammatory reactions in the lung, that neutrophils are involved in development of the symptoms and signs of this disease, and that neutrophil chemotactic factors, including complement-derived factors, are important in neutrophil recruitment at the lesion and in nonaffected parts of the lung.\r"

This observation led us to examine the possible role of activated T cells in the pathogenesis of intestinal lesions in a group of 13 children with intractable diarrhea and villous atrophy of unknown origin. Immunohistochemical study showed signs of intestinal mononuclear cell activation in seven patients. These signs included a marked increase in the number of mucosal T cells, mainly TCR alpha beta+, the appearance of lamina propria interleukin-2-receptor-bearing cells, and an increased expression of HLA-DR antigens by enterocytes. No local cause of intestinal T-cell activation was found. However, four out of seven patients had extradigestive symptoms of autoimmunity, suggesting that the intestine might also be the site of an autoimmune reaction responsible for the epithelial lesions. In these patients, presence of crypt necrosis and colic extension of the lesions suggested poor prognosis. In contrast, in six other patients, no immunohistochemical evidence of mucosal T-cell activation was obtained. In the latter cases, analysis of clinical data favored the hypothesis of a primary inborn defect of enterocyte differentiation.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method after tissue sections were reacted with antibody against human P450IIE1. In control animals, immunoreactive P450IIE1 was detected only in duodenal and jejunal villous cells. After ethanol treatment, the content of P450IIE1 increased in duodenal and jejunal villi, and the enzyme was now also found in squamous epithelial cells of the cheek mucosa, tongue, esophagus, and forestomach, and in surface epithelium of the proximal colon. P450IIE1 was neither expressed nor induced by alcohol in the epithelium of stomach fundic and antral mucosa, ileum, distal colon, and rectum. When considered together with the xenobiotic activation properties of P450IIE1, these results may partly explain why alcohol abuse is a risk factor for cellular damage or cancer or both in those alimentary tract tissues in which P450IIE1 is inducible by chronic ethanol intake.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of hepatitis B virus antigens was studied by double staining liver tissue with appropriate antisera and correlated with serum hepatitis B viral DNA and histology in 28 patients with disease related to chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The cellular localization of hepatitis B core and hepatitis B e antigens generally coincided, but there were important differences at a subcellular level. Thus, hepatitis B e antigen was detected in nuclei and/or cytoplasm but strong cytoplasmic hepatitis B e antigen was associated with a high serum hepatitis B viral DNA (P = 0.0017) but not with active liver disease. Hepatitis B core antigen could also be detected in nuclei and/or cytoplasm, but strong cytoplasmic hepatitis B core antigen expression, exceeding that of hepatitis B e antigen, was associated with active liver disease (P = 0.041) and not with serum hepatitis B virus DNA. The proportion of hepatocytes expressing hepatitis B surface antigen correlated inversely with the serum titer (P = 0.0017), whereas hepatitis B surface and nucleocapsid antigens were usually expressed independently. The data support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic hepatitis B core antigen and not hepatitis B e antigen is the target for immune system-mediated cytolysis of hepatocytes. Cytoplasmic hepatitis B e antigen is not associated with liver damage but is instead associated with high levels of hepatitis B virus replication.\r"

  ".U": "90368160\r", 
  ".W": "Diuretic therapy may enhance renin release by various mechanisms, principally contraction of extracellular fluid volume and its effects, including a fall in arterial pressure. Awake hydropenic or volume-expanded rats received diuretics (amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide) that are known inhibitors of NaCl transport beyond the macula densa; also the well-known Na(+)-K(+)-2 Cl- transport system inhibitor furosemide was administered. We also evaluated the effect of a dose of ethacrynic acid (a drug that shares the same mechanism of action as furosemide but is not diuretic in the rat). The direct action of the diuretics on renin-producing cells was examined in isolated glomeruli; a rise in renin release was observed with the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine (10(-5) M). Renin release in intact hydropenic rats was not altered by diuretic therapy, but furosemide increased plasma renin activity in hydropenic as well as in volume-expanded rats. This demonstrates the importance of furosemide inhibition of transport in the macula densa for its renin secretory action. None of the diuretics (amiloride, hydrochlorothiazide, ethacrynic acid, or furosemide) elicited changes in renin release from glomeruli (10(-6) to 10(-3) M); amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) did not change renin release from slices, but 10(-3) M ethacrynic acid and furosemide increased renin secretion in this preparation. This suggests that an effect on the macula densa is essential in loop diuretic-mediated renin release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These concentrations rose in dialyses with new and re-used dialysers, but remained unchanged during sequential ultrafiltration. beta 2m increased with serum hypo-osmolality, decreased with serum hyperosmolality and did not change during iso-osmolar dialysis. These results indicate that cuprophan membrane does not raise beta 2m concentration during dialysis. It is hypo-osmolality that is responsible for the increment of beta 2m in serum.\r"

Eleven men and women (6 TRN, 5 SED) underwent a 6-h primed, constant-rate infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine. Leucine turnover and oxidation were measured using tracer dilution and by measuring 13C enrichment of expired CO2 combined with respiratory calorimetry. Whole-body leucine turnover was greater in the TRN subjects (P less than 0.004; TRN 98.3 +/- 5.0, SED 75.3 +/- 4.2 mumol.kg-1.h-1; mean +/- SE), but there was no difference between groups in leucine oxidation (TRN 13.1 +/- 0.97, SED 11.5 +/- 0.48 mumol.kg-1.h-1). Thus more leucine turnover was available for nonoxidative utilization. In addition, the TRN subjects had higher resting energy expenditures compared with the SED group, and when all subjects were included in the analysis, there was a significant correlation between energy expenditure and protein turnover (n = 11, R = 0.61, P = 0.05). Therefore the heightened resting energy expenditure in the TRN subjects may be accounted for by an increased whole-body protein turnover. These results suggest that endurance training results in increased leucine and/or protein turnover, which may contribute to the increased resting energy expenditure observed in these subjects.\r"

The present study examined the effects of CPAP (7.5-10 cmH2O) on the pattern of respiratory muscle activation and its relationship to dyspnea during constant work load submaximal bicycle exercise [20 +/- 4.8 (SE) W] in eight COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s = 25 +/- 3% predicted). Tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, and end-expiratory lung volume increased with exercise as expected. There was no change in breathing pattern, end-expiratory lung volume, or pulmonary compliance and resistance with the addition of CPAP. CPAP reduced inspiratory muscle effort, as indicated by the pressure-time integral of transdiaphragmatic (integral of Pdi.dt) and esophageal pressure (integral of Pes.dt, P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the pressure-time integral of gastric pressure (integral of Pga.dt), used as an index of abdominal muscle recruitment during expiration, increased (P less than 0.01). Dyspnea improved with CPAP in five of the eight patients. The amelioration of dyspnea was directly related to reductions in integral of Pes.dt (P less than 0.001) but inversely related to increases in integral of Pga.dt (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, CPAP reduces inspiratory muscle effort during exercise in COPD patients. However, the expected improvement in dyspnea is not seen in all patients and may be explained by more marked increases in expiratory muscle effort in some individuals.\r"

Before and after 9 wk and 9 mo of acclimation, sweat glands were dissected from biopsy specimens of the lateral calf, cannulated, and stimulated in vitro with MCh. Morphological measurements of isolated tubules were compared with maximal secretory rates produced by MCh stimulation. Three weeks of acclimation 1) reduced Tre and Tsk and increased msw during the heat tolerance test and 2) significantly increased maximal msw in response to MCh stimulation. Acclimation also increased (P less than 0.05) sweat gland size, as measured by tubular length and tubular volume. Maximal in vitro msw produced by MCh stimulation and msw per unit length of secretory coil also increased significantly. We conclude that heat acclimation increases the size of eccrine sweat glands and that these larger glands produce more sweat. They are also more efficient because they produce more sweat per unit length of secretory coil.\r"

  ".W": "The assumption that the lung is an effective filter for gas bubbles is of importance for certain occupations (e.g., divers, astronauts) as well as in the accomplishment of several medical procedures. The filtering capacity was tested in pigs by use of continuous air infusion into the right ventricle and a transesophageal echocardiographic transducer for detection of air in the left atrium. Twenty pigs, anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and mechanically ventilated, were divided into groups that received air at infusion rates of 0.05 (group 1a, n = 7), 0.10 (group 2, n = 6), and 0.20 (group 3, n = 5) ml.kg-1.min-1. Two pigs served as controls. The breakthrough incidence was 0, 67, and 100%, respectively. Group 1a received a second infusion of 0.10 ml.kg-1.min-1 (group 1b, n = 7), and spillover of bubbles occurred in only 14% of these pigs. Infusion of gas caused a maximum increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 129 +/- 9% to 39.2 +/- 1.3 (SE) mmHg, with no significant difference between the groups. Breakthrough was observed only in animals with a dramatic reduction in mean arterial pressure and a PAP that returned to almost-normal values at spillover time. Our results suggest that the threshold value for breakthrough of air bubbles in pigs is reduced compared with that in dogs. The hemodynamic consequences at a given infusion rate are, however, greatly enhanced.\r"

Arginine was infused for 90 min to seven trained and seven untrained young men. Arginine and glucose concentrations increased identically in the groups. The insulin response was biphasic and waned despite increasing arginine concentrations. Both these phases as well as C-peptide responses were reduced in trained subjects, whereas proinsulin responses were similar in the groups. Identical increases were found in glucagon, growth hormone, catecholamines, and production and disappearance of glucose; identical decreases were found in free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. In conclusion, in men training diminishes both arginine- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating a profound beta-cell adaptation. Being enhanced, the effects of insulin on both production and disposal of glucose are changed in the opposite direction to beta-cell secretion by training. The responses of glucagon- and growth hormone-secreting cells to arginine do not change with training.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of acute exercise on insulin action has been studied in six obese (150-250% ideal body weight) non-insulin-dependent diabetics (OD), seven obese normoglycemics (ON), and six lean healthy controls (LC). Using a three-stage euglycemic clamp, the metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of glucose under increasing insulin concentrations was measured. The insulin dose-response curve was assessed on two separate occasions: 1) a base-line test and 2) 1 h after aerobic treadmill exercise at a steady-state heart rate of 150-160 beats/min. In the base-line test, under all insulin levels, glucose MCR was significantly lower in obese compared with lean individuals (P less than 0.01). Exercise increased glucose MCR at the highest hormonal concentrations applied to 124 and 134% of base line in OD and in ON, respectively (P less than 0.05); the insulin concentration required for one-half of the maximal clearance rate of glucose achieved in this study decreased from 200 to 130 and from 160 to 95 microU/ml in OD and ON, respectively (P less than 0.05). The changes in these parameters were insignificant in LC. It is suggested that acute exercise affected the insulin dose-response curve in OD and in ON but not in LC; although enhanced by exercise, glucose MCR remained significantly lower in both obese groups compared with control subjects. We concluded that insulin resistance, which accompanies extreme obesity, could be markedly decreased but not completely reversed by one bout of exercise.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of octreotide in vivo and in vitro on hormone release, in vivo [123I]Tyr3-octreotide scanning, and in vitro [125I]Tyr3-octreotide autoradiography were compared in five patients with endocrine pancreatic tumors. [123I]Tyr3-octreotide scanning localized the primary tumor and/or previously unknown metastases in four of the five patients. The patient with a negative scan had an insulinoma that did not respond to octreotide in vivo. No Tyr3-octreotide-binding sites were subsequently found at autoradiography of the tumor, whereas somatostatin-14 receptors were present at a high density. In parallel, culture studies with the cells prepared from this adenoma showed that insulin release was not affected by octreotide, while both somatostatin-14 and -28 significantly suppressed hormone release. Culture studies of the tumor cells from two gastrinomas showed a dose-dependent inhibition of gastrin release by octreotide. Octreotide exerted direct antiproliferative effects in one of these gastrinomas, which had been shown to be rapidly growing in vivo. Both gastrinomas had specific somatostatin receptors, as measured by in vitro receptor autoradiography. Somatostatin release by the cultured somatostatinoma cells from one of these patients was suppressed by octreotide. In conclusion, 1) the [123I]Tyr3-octreotide scanning procedure is valuable in the localization of primary endocrine pancreatic tumors as well their often clinically not yet recognized metastases; 2) the in vitro detection of somatostatin receptors in those tumors that were also visualized in vivo after injection of [123I] Tyr3-octreotide indicates that the ligand binding to the tumor in vivo indeed represents binding to specific somatostatin receptors; and 3) the parallel between the presence of somatostatin receptors on tumors and in in vivo and in vitro effects of octreotide on hormonal release from these tumors indicate that a positive scan predicts a good suppressive effect of octreotide on hormonal hypersecretion by these tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the correlation between urinary GH, urinary albumin, and beta-2-microglobulin excretion to determine how the excretion of GH relates to markers of renal glomerular and tubular function. Urinary albumin and GH excretion was determined in timed daytime and nighttime urine collections obtained from both subjects with diabetes mellitus and subjects with short stature. For subjects with diabetes, urinary GH excretion rate correlated highly with urinary albumin concentration and excretion rate in both the range of 0 to 1.6 g/L (r = 0.75), P less than 0.001) and in the microalbuminuria range, 0 to 0.4 g/L (r = 0.53, P less than 0.001). Changes in GH and albumin excretion occurred in parallel in 71% of the subjects with diabetes and elevated albumin excretion. The mean GH excretion rate was higher in the group with elevated albumin excretion rate (AER) during both day and night compared to the group with microalbuminuria during the day and normal AER at night. For subjects with short stature, the mean albumin excretion rate was 0.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms/min (range 0.05-8.3 micrograms/min) using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure albumin concentration. The correlation of GH and albumin excretion rates for the subjects with short stature was not statistically significant (r = 0.14, P less than 0.5). About half of the subjects with diabetes and elevated AER (greater than 10 micrograms/min) had a GH excretion rate within the range observed in subjects with short stature. The GH and albumin excretion rate were not correlated in this group. There was a positive correlation of both albumin and GH excretion rate with age in the subjects with diabetes. Urinary GH and beta-2-microglobulin excretion rates were determined in a larger group of subjects with diabetes and a separate group with short stature. Urinary GH and beta-2-microglobulin excretion were correlated both in subjects with diabetes (r = 0.46, P less than 0.001) and with short stature (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001). The association was present in urine collected either during the day or night. The mean GH excretion rate of the group with diabetes was greater than the group with short stature. In conclusion, there was an association of urinary GH and albumin excretion rate in subjects with abnormal glomerular function as indicated by elevated albumin excretion rate. An association of urinary GH and beta-2-microglobulin excretion was observed in subjects with normal tubular function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

However, concern still exists about central nervous system sequelae which may persist due to a period of untreated intrauterine hypothyroidism. Presence of polyhydramnios led to the ultrasound diagnosis of a fetal goiter. Hypothyroidism was confirmed at 34 weeks gestation by percutaneous fetal blood sampling, which revealed an elevated TSH (186 mU/L) and a low T4 (19.3 nmol/L). Intraamniotic fluid injections of 500 micrograms levothyroxine sodium (T4) every 10-14 days increased fetal serum T4 (59.2 nmol/L), decreased fetal serum TSH (14 mU/L), decreased amniotic fluid TSH, and decreased the size of the fetal goiter. The infant was born at term without perinatal complications. Thyroid function studies on cord blood were normal (T4, 109.4 nmol/L; TSH, 1.3 mU/L), and the infant was discharged on oral T4. Follow-up examination at age 6 weeks revealed that the infant was developmentally normal and clinically and chemically euthyroid. Intrauterine T4 therapy can suppress fetal TSH and treat fetal hypothyroidism despite hypothyroid levels of serum T3. Highly sensitive TSH assays may allow the use of amniotic fluid TSH as a marker for fetal hypothyroidism.\r"

These molecules were localized by their reactivity with monoclonal antibodies in an avidinbiotin-complex procedure. Interleukin-2 receptor was not expressed in human endometria; however, endometrial T-cells within lymphoid aggregates, some scattered in endometrial stroma and a few within epithelium, expressed HLA-DR, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and VLA-1. In addition, expression of the receptor of interferon-gamma, a product of activated T-cells, was observed on endometrial epithelium. Evidence for activation of T-cells and expression of interferon-gamma receptor in human endometrial epithelium suggests that endometrium may be an active site for cytokine action.\r"

Serum concentrations of androgens after the first 400-mg dose of DHEA increased rapidly and reached a maximum at 180-240 min, resulting in increases over baseline of 6-fold for DHEA (5.8 +/- 2.1 to 28.8 +/- 5.5 nmol/L), 12-fold for DS (3.0 +/- 1.6 to 28.2 +/- 4.6 mumol/L) and androstenedione (1.4 +/- 0.3 to 19.5 +/- 9.8 nmol/L), 2.5-fold for testosterone (0.7 +/- 0.1 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 nmol/L), and 15-fold for dihydrotestosterone (0.2 +/- 0.06 to 2.73 +/- 1.0 nmol/L), but estrone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were unchanged. Assessment at weekly intervals revealed a further increase in all androgens which was maximal at 2 weeks and remained markedly elevated, although it declined somewhat by 4 weeks. The increments observed after 2 weeks of DHEA administration reached 15-fold for DHEA (71.9 +/- 14.2 nmol/L), 9-fold for testosterone (6.5 +/- 1.7 nmol/L), and 20-fold for DS (65.1 +/- 14.9 nmol/L), androstenedione (30.5 +/- 11.5 nmol/L), and dihyrotestosterone (3.8 +/- 1.5 nmol/L). Both estrone and estradiol showed a progressive increase to 2-fold the basal value at 4 weeks. Integrated SHBG and thyroid binding globulin levels decreased (P less than 0.05) during DHEA treatment. However, LH, FSH, body weight, and percent body fat, as measured by underwater weighing, were unaltered during the 4-week experiment. A marked decline of 11.3% (P less than 0.05) in serum cholesterol and 20.0% (P less than 0.05) in high density lipoprotein noted within the first week of DHEA administration persisted for the 28-day period and was accompanied by a nonsignificant downward trend in low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, and triglycerides. Peak insulin levels during the 3-h oral glucose tolerance test were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) after the 28 days of DHEA (1126 +/- 165 vs. 746 +/- 165 pmol/L) and were accompanied by a 50% increase in the integrated insulin response (P less than 0.01) without a significant change in fasting glucose insulin or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Several variables showed significant differences between the groups; the levels of PRL, estrone, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, and LH were lowest in the patients with anorexia nervosa. The lean control group showed intermediate values for progesterone, androstenedione, and, to a smaller extent, testosterone. The FSH response to GnRH was significantly higher in the patient group, corresponding to the pattern of late prepubertal girls. Ten patients were seen in a follow-up study. Five had resumption of the menstrual cycle, and the others still had amenorrhea. The two subgroups did not differ in either weight gain or the basal hormonal variables investigated. After weight gain an increased LH response to GnRH was observed in both subgroups. Patients who had resumption of the menstrual cycle showed a higher response of LH to GnRH, both before and after weight gain. The mean increase in LH after GnRH administration was significantly different between the two subgroups. The results suggest that the GnRH test may be useful to assess the stage of the disease and to predict the outcome, especially with regard to restoration of the menstrual cycle.\r"

To isolate the primary effects of alcohol dependence on the stress axis, the ACTH and cortisol responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were measured in seven actively drinking male alcoholics recruited from the general public through a newspaper advertisement along with eight age-matched male controls. The alcoholic subjects met current American Psychiatric Association diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence, were stably employed, and had no concurrent psychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, or psychometric evidence of depression. While relatively young (30.0 yr; range, 22-48 yr), they had lengthy histories of alcohol-related problems (11.9 yr; range, 5-30 yr). Insulin administration resulted in similar nadirs in blood sugar in both alcoholic and control groups. However, the plasma ACTH response was markedly blunted in the alcoholics (P = 0.040, by Mann-Whitney U test). There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased cortisol levels in the alcoholic group. The findings suggest that altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in alcoholics is a primary results of chronic ethanol exposure rather than a confounding effect of clinical depression or recent detoxification.\r"

[35S]Methionine incorporation into IL-1 induced, immunoprecipitable HLA-DR molecules demonstrated de novo synthesis of both light and heavy chains of the HLA-DR molecules. Lipopolysaccharide, recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant interleukin-6 failed to induce HLA-DR expression in these epithelial cells. In contrast to the dramatic effect on HLA-DR expression, IL-1 had no effect on the epithelial cell proliferation. Pretreatment of T47D cells with estradiol-17 beta significantly decreased the IL-1 induced HLA-DR expression, and pretreatment of IL-1 with an IL-1 specific antibody, neutralized IL-1 action. These studies demonstrate that a cytokine (IL-1) and a sex steroid hormone estradiol-17 beta can interact to regulate the expression of HLA-DR molecules in epithelial cells.\r"

  ".U": "90368985\r", 
  ".W": "In inflammation monocytes emigrate from the peripheral circulation into an extravascular area rich in extracellular matrix proteins. In this milieu, phagocytes ingest and kill invading pathogens. In the present studies, we found that monocytes adhered to type I collagen gels phagocytized 2.5-12-fold more opsonized Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae than plastic-adherent monocytes. The rate of phagocytosis and the number of bacteria ingested by collagen-adherent monocytes was equal to, or greater than, the number of bacteria ingested by 7-d cultured macrophages (M phi). Although both collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes were bactericidal for E. coli and S. aureus, more bacteria were killed by collagen-adherent monocytes by virtue of their enhanced phagocytic capacity. Cultured M phi only were bacteriostatic. Adherence of monocytes to collagen gels activated C receptors (CR) types 1 and 3 for phagocytosis, and enhanced Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis. Collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes produced equivalent amounts of superoxide anion in response to phorbol myristate acetate and opsonized zymosan. Thus, the enhanced phagocytosis and killing of opsonized bacteria by collagen-adherent monocytes appear to be by regulation of the function of membrane CR and FcR, without apparent enhancement of the respiratory burst. These data suggest that adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix during inflammation may rapidly activate these cells for enhanced phagocytic bactericidal activity.\r"

  ".U": "90368986\r", 
  ".W": "The therapeutic effects of saccharolytic and proteolytic enzymes were investigated in models of IgA nephropathy. Mesangial glomerulonephritis was induced in mice by intravenous injection of preformed soluble immune complexes of dextran sulfate and either IgA (J 558) or IgM (MOPC 104 E) anti-dextran MAb (passive model) or by immunization with DEAE dextran (active model). In the passive model, only 30-40% of dextranase-treated mice given IgA or IgM immune complexes had mesangial Ig or dextran deposits, compared with 100% of saline-treated controls (P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in mice given only protease. In the active model, dextranase and protease separately each reduced glomerular dextran and C3 deposits, and hematuria (P less than 0.01). Dextranase also reduced the glomerular IgA deposits (20 vs. 100% of saline-treated mice) and the frequency and severity of mesangial matrix expansion (both P less than 0.02), but did not reduce the modest IgG or IgM codeposits. Protease reduced IgG and IgM deposits, proteinuria and mesangial hypercellularity compared with saline (P less than 0.02), but did not diminish IgA, and had no effect on mesangial matrix expansion. The combination of dextranase plus protease attenuated all components of glomerular injury as judged by clinical and pathological parameters, but inactivated dextranase plus inactivated protease had no effect on any parameter. We conclude that enzymatic digestion of antigen and antibody can reduce immune deposits, mesangial proliferation, proteinuria, and hematuria in experimental glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether insulin secretion is affected by a blockage of gap junctions between B cells, we have studied the secretion of rat pancreatic islets of Langerhans, primary dispersed islet cells, and cells of the RINm5F line, during short-term exposure to heptanol. Within minutes, this alkanol blocked gap junctions between the B cells of intact islets and abolished their normal secretory response to glucose. These two changes were rapidly and fully reversible after return of the islets to control medium. We further found that heptanol had no significant effect on the glucose-stimulated secretion of single B cells but inhibited that of B cell pairs. In the clone of RINm5F cells, whose junctional coupling and D-glyceraldehyde-induced stimulation of insulin release by aggregated cells were also inhibited by heptanol, this alkanol did not perturb intracellular pH and Ca2+ and the most distal steps of the secretion pathway. In summary, a gap junction blocker affected the secretion of insulin-producing cells by a mechanism which is dependent on cell contact and is not associated with detectable pleiotropic perturbations of the cell secretory machinery. The data provide evidence for the involvement of junctional coupling in the control of insulin secretion.\r"

From admission radioisotopic circulating red cell volumes and simultaneous venous hematocrits, the model-derived sequestrum hematocrit (mean [95% confidence limits]: 0.70 [0.43-0.97], n = 29) was twice that of peripheral blood (0.33 [0.30-0.36]). Serial reticulocyte and radiolabeled erythrocyte counts indicated that small numbers of cells enter the circulation during initial therapy. The mean fall in hematocrit over 84 h in 26 nontransfused patients conformed to a three-term equation. A first-order decline (t1/2 2.0 h [0.6-3.4]) suggested an average 7.5% plasma volume expansion through rehydration. A zero-order 6.3% (3.1-9.5) fall (t1/2 25.7 h [21.2-30.2]) occurred contemporaneously with a fall in mean parasitemia from 4.5% (3.6-5.4); from these data the model-derived average sequestered erythrocyte volume (4.8% of the admission hematocrit) was similar to the peripheral parasite burden. A second, first-order fall (t1/2 1,047 h [278-1,816]) indicated loss of uninfected erythrocytes with mean lifespan 62 d. Predicted total plasma volume expansion during initial therapy (21.2%) was similar to radioisotopic estimates in 11 patients (17.3% [2.0-33.1]). Application of the model to individual patient data showed wide variations in relative proportions of circulating and sequestered parasitized cells. The model provides evidence of the nature and fate of all parasitized erythrocytes in malaria.\r"

To determine whether one of these subclasses is associated with murine lupus, oligonucleotide probes specific for Pmv or Mpmv sequences were used in Northern analyses. Thymus 8.4 kb Mpmv RNA was expressed in five of five lupus-prone strains and crosses and this expression was not affected by genes that retard or accelerate development of lupus. Two of four leukemia-prone strains expressed low levels of such thymic transcripts, but none of 11 control strains did. 8.4 kb Mpmv RNA expression was not induced in thymuses of control mice by the lpr/lpr or gld/gld genotypes (which cause polyclonal immune activation) nor by treatment with mitogens. In contrast to Mpmv, thymic 8.4 kb Pmv expression was poorly associated with autoimmunity: it was easily detected in nearly all strains, and was increased by polyclonal activation in control mice. These studies indicate that the organ-specific thymic 8.4 kb Mpmv expression (a) is characteristic of several genetic backgrounds which predispose to murine lupus, (b) precedes and does not correlate with disease development, (c) is not due to polyclonal activation, and (d) is regulated independently of 8.4 kb Pmv expression.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined whether a molecule that is capable of inducing immune protection, the major secretory protein (MSP) of Legionella pneumophila, is required for virulence in a guinea pig model of Legionnaires' disease. To do so, we have compared the virulence in guinea pigs of an isogenic pair of L. pneumophila, Philadelphia 1 strain, one of which produces MSP (MSP+) and one of which does not (MSP-). Both the MSP- strain and the MSP+ strain of L. pneumophila are highly virulent for guinea pigs, inducing similar signs and progression of illness. Both strains are lethal and have comparable LD50s and LD100s. Both strains multiply in the lungs of guinea pigs at a similar rate, and both strains produce indistinguishable pathological lesions in the lungs. Both strains maintain a stable phenotype with guinea pig passage, i.e., the MSP- strain does not regain the capacity to secrete MSP and the MSP+ strain retains its capacity to secrete MSP after lung passage. Although vaccination with MSP induces strong protective immunity in the guinea pig against lethal aerosol challenge with L. pneumophila, this protective immunogen is not required in its intact proteolytically active form for the expression of virulence by the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila. This demonstrates that a protective immune response need not necessarily be directed against a virulence determinant and suggests that any molecule that allows the host immune system to detect and act against an intracellularly sequestered pathogen may potentially serve as a protective immunogen against such a pathogen.\r"

The potential roles for VIP in human nasal mucosa were studied using an integrated approach. The VIP content of human nasal mucosa was determined to be 2.84 +/- 0.47 pmol/g wet weight (n = 8) by RIA. VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibers were found to be most concentrated in submucosal glands adjacent to serous and mucous cells. 125I-VIP binding sites were located on submucosal glands, epithelial cells, and arterioles. In short-term explant culture, VIP stimulated lactoferrin release from serous cells but did not stimulate [3H]glucosamine-labeled respiratory glycoconjugate secretion. Methacholine was more potent than VIP, and methacholine stimulated both lactoferrin and respiratory glycoconjugate release. The addition of VIP plus methacholine to explants resulted in additive increases in lactoferrin release. Based upon the autoradiographic distribution of 125I-VIP binding sites and the effects on explants, VIP derived from parasympathetic nerve fibers may function in the regulation of serous cell secretion in human nasal mucosa. VIP may also participate in the regulation of vasomotor tone.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant human IL 1 beta inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets and from purified beta-cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of dispersed islet cells. Brief (1 h) exposure of isolated islets to IL 1 produces sustained inhibition of insulin secretion for at least 17 h after the IL 1 has been removed from the culture medium. An inhibitory effect of IL 1 on insulin secretion is not observed when islets are coincubated with an inhibitor of DNA transcription (actinomycin D). This finding indicates that the inhibitory effect of IL 1 on insulin secretion requires transcription of one or more genes during the first hour of exposure of islets to IL 1. The inhibitory effect of IL 1 on insulin secretion also requires mRNA translation, because three structurally distinct inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide, anisomycin, and puromycin) prevent IL 1-induced inhibition of insulin secretion when added to islets after the 1-h exposure to IL 1. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of islet proteins metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine demonstrates that IL 1 augments the expression of a 65-kD (pl approximately 6.5) protein by greater than 2.5-fold. These findings indicate that biochemical events occurring within 1 h of exposure of islets to IL 1 lead to an inhibition of insulin secretion that persists for at least 17 h after the removal of IL 1. One of the early biochemical effects of IL 1 on islets is gene transcription (0-1 h), which is followed by mRNA translation (after 1 h). Our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of IL 1 on insulin secretion is mediated by protein(s) whose synthesis is induced by IL 1.\r"

  ".W": "A second cDNA for human tryptase, called beta-tryptase, was cloned from a mast cell cDNA library in lambda ZAP. Its nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence were determined and compared with those of a previously cloned tryptase cDNA, now called alpha-tryptase. The 1,142-base sequence of beta-tryptase encodes a 30-amino acid leader sequence of 3,089 D and a 245-amino acid catalytic region of 27,458 D. The amino acid sequence of beta-tryptase is 90% identical with that of alpha-tryptase, the first 20 amino acids of the catalytic portions being 100% identical. This identity, together with recognition of each recombinant protein by monoclonal antibodies directed against purified tryptase validate the tryptase identity of both alpha-tryptase and beta-tryptase cDNA molecules. Modest differences between the nucleic acid sequences of alpha- and beta-tryptase occurred throughout the cDNA molecules except in the 3' noncoding regions, which were identical. Although most highly conserved regions of amino acid sequence in the trypsin superfamily are conserved in both tryptase molecules, beta-tryptase has one carbohydrate binding site compared to two in alpha-tryptase, and one additional amino acid in the catalytic sequence. Regions of the substrate binding pocket in beta-tryptase (DSCQ, residues 218-221; SWG, residues 243-245) differ slightly from those in alpha-tryptase (DSCK, residues 217-220; SWD, residues 242-244). The presence of both alpha- and beta-tryptase sequences in each haploid genome was indicated by finding alpha- and beta-tryptase specific fragments after amplification by PCR of genomic DNA in 10 unrelated individuals. Localization of both alpha- and beta-tryptase sequences to human chromosome 16 was then performed by analysis of DNA preparations from 25 human/hamster somatic hybrids by PCR. It is now possible to assess the expression of each tryptase cDNA by mast cells and the relationship of each gene product to the active enzyme.\r"

Cultured human decidual cells release three IGF-BPs with 24,000, 30,000, and 34,000 Mr. Using ligand blot analysis and an RIA for the 30,000-Mr form (IGF-BP-1), we examined the effects of IGF-I (10-1,000 ng/ml), insulin (10-10,000 ng/ml), and relaxin (10-250 ng/ml) on decidual cell IGF-BP release after 120 h of hormone exposure. IGF-I inhibited release of both IGF-BP-1 and the 24,000 Mr form. Inhibition of IGF-BP-1 release was noted after 48 h of treatment and was progressive throughout the subsequent 120 h. Insulin stimulated a fourfold increase in release of the 24,000-Mr protein while inhibiting IGF-BP-1 release comparable to IGF-I, alpha-IR3, a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor, blocked approximately 33% of the IGF-I response but had no effect on insulin-mediated IGF-BP-1 inhibition. Relaxin stimulated a 2.4-fold increase in release of the 24,000-Mr form and a 16-fold increase in the 30,000-Mr protein after 120 h. Stimulation of the 30,000-Mr protein was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide (50 micrograms/ml). Both IGF-I and insulin also blocked the relaxin-mediated increase in IGF-BP-1. These studies suggest that three structurally related proteins differentially regulate IGF-BP secretion possibly via activation of distinct receptor subtypes.\r"

The establishment of an adherent cell layer was never observed. Cultures containing no exogenous cytokine produced clonogenic cells for only 1 wk. IL-1 alpha and IL-6 were alone able to support hematopoiesis for 2 or 3 wk. Cells maintained with GM-CSF proliferated and contained assayable colony-forming cells for 3 or 4 wk, while maximal cellular expansion and generation of assayable progenitor cells occurred in the presence of IL-3 for 4-5 wk. When IL-3 was combined with IL-1 alpha or IL-6, hematopoiesis was sustained for 8 wks. Basophil numbers were markedly increased in the presence of IL-3. These studies indicate that marrow subpopulations can sustain hematopoiesis in vitro in the presence of repeated additions of cytokines. We conclude that a major function of marrow adherent cells in long-term cultures is that of providing cytokines which promote the proliferation and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells.\r"

Tissue and blood cultures grew Fusarium proliferatum, and a skin biopsy specimen revealed fungal vasculitis. Anemia and muscle weakness accompanied the disseminated infection, for which the patient received granulocyte transfusions and amphotericin B, ketoconazole, rifampin, and griseofulvin. Skin lesions and fungemia resolved with recovery of the bone marrow, and 51 days after the completion of his chemotherapy he returned home. If promptly recognized and aggressively treated, disseminated fusariosis is responsive to therapy. Infection with Fusarium species should be suspected in profoundly neutropenic patients in whom disseminated palpable purpura and myositis develop concomitantly.\r"

  ".U": "90369120\r", 
  ".W": "Cell death is a common phenomenon in developmental biology, and recent data suggest that it is as tightly regulated as mitosis. For numerous systems endocrine and neuronal factors are required to maintain viability of cells, as are specific diffusible and other unknown factors deriving from intimate cell-to-cell contact; and, in some instances, specific hormones or other circulating factors induce spontaneous self-destruction by the targeted cells. Some cells such as thymocytes may be primed to self-destruct and hence activate specific enzymes. In others, the doomed cell up-regulates a limited number of genes just before it dies. Of these genes, several are known but are not considered to cause cell death; others are under investigation. Although the situation is clearest for developmental biology, it appears that the presumptively random loss of cells in senescence results from invocation of the same mechanisms. Understanding and control of these mechanisms could conceivably lead either to protection against cell loss or specific induction of lysis in malignant cells.\r"

  ".U": "90369125\r", 
  ".W": "The age-related declines in the antilipolytic and lipogenic actions of insulin were studied in adipocytes from rats aged 2, 6, 12, and 24 months. Since adenosine modulates insulin action, its concentration was controlled by treatment of adipocytes with adenosine deaminase and addition of the non-metabolizable adenosine analog, N6-[(R)-(-)1-methyl-2-phenethyl] adenosine (PIA). Inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis by PIA increased significantly by 6 months of age. Decreasing the concentration of PIA rendered the adipocytes from the 6-, 12-, and 24-mo-old rats less sensitive to the antilipolytic effect of insulin. Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis decreased with aging. PIA increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis at 0.2 ng/ml insulin only in the 2-month-old rats. PIA reduced insulin-stimulated lipogenesis at higher insulin doses in the oldest rats. These results suggest that aging causes quantitative declines in maximal lipolysis and basal and maximal lipogenesis. Maturation may cause a decline in sensitivity to insulin, but adenosine in sufficient concentration reverses the acquired resistance to the antilipolytic effect of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis is a common complication of chronic glucocorticoid therapy, especially in older patients who already are at risk of having a reduced bone mass. Glucocorticoids cause bone loss by altering the bone remodeling sequence: bone resorption by osteoclasts is increased, and bone formation by osteoblasts is decreased. Serum levels of osteocalcin, a protein made by osteoblasts, are decreased with glucocorticoid therapy, further evidence of decreased osteoblast function. Glucocorticoids decrease calcium absorption by the gastrointestinal tract and increase renal calcium excretion. Several recent studies suggest that low-dose glucocorticoid therapy is not associated with bone loss. Calcium supplementation with vitamin D is recommended. Several short-term studies have shown prevention of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and progesterone. Long-term clinical trials should be undertaken to determine strategies to prevent this type of osteoporosis.\r"

Calcium carbonate or placebo was administered for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-week administration of the alternative intervention. Fasting blood samples and 24-hour urine collections were obtained at baseline, and at the end of each intervention period. Calcium supplementation (1000 mg/day) decreased serum PTH levels from a mean of 50.1 +/- 3.0 pg/ml to 41.9 +/- 2.4 pg/ml (p less than .001). Additionally, urine calcium excretion significantly increased during calcium administration (from 3.64 mmol/mmol creatinine at baseline to 4.28 mmol/mmol creatinine), but creatinine clearances and serum calcium levels remained unchanged. Type II osteoporosis has been associated with age-related increases in PTH levels. We have demonstrated the ability of increased calcium intake to decrease these levels, which may have implications for the management of a subset of patients with involutional osteoporosis.\r"

One of the characteristics of plasma Lp(a) is to vary widely in concentration and to be heterogeneous in size and density. Apo(a) also exhibits an important size heterogeneity that is related to the number of kringle 4 domains under the control of the apo(a) gene. Epidemiologic studies have linked high plasma levels of Lp(a) to an increased prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by yet undefined mechanisms. It is possible that because of its unique structural features, Lp(a) may have both atherogenic and thrombogenic actions.\r"

Treatment of plasma to overcome inhibitory activities is required before plasma can be successfully assayed for endotoxin. We have conducted an investigation comparing the three most commonly used procedures (dilution-heating, trifluoroacetic acid oxidation, and chloroform extraction) for treatment of plasma before its assay for endotoxin with the chromogenic Limulus test. Initially, conditions were optimized for treatment of plasma by each of these methods. Subsequently, a direct comparison of the three plasma treatment procedures was performed with plasma spiked with known concentrations of endotoxin. The optimized dilution-heating procedure resulted in the most sensitive detection of endotoxin, with sensitivity approximately 10 times greater than the optimized trifluoroacetic acid oxidation procedure and approximately 100 times greater than treatment of plasma by chloroform extraction. Maximal detection of low concentrations of endotoxin by the chromogenic Limulus test was obtained by dilution of plasma fourfold with 0.15 mol/L NaCl followed by heating at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes. This procedure was simple, rapid, and did not involve addition of any reagents to plasma that could potentially add contaminating endotoxin.\r"

We cultured murine bone marrow cells treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate in a serum-free system with serum-free pokeweek mitogen-stimulated spleen cell conditioned medium (PWM-SCM) and an unknown factor, preparing two microplates with the identical culture system. In the first plate, the total number of Ach-E-positive cells induced solely by the factor tested was indicative of Meg-CSF activity and additive increases in this parameter on simultaneous addition of PWM-SCM and the factor tested were indicative of early Meg-Pot activity. Total Ach-E activity (total change at optical density of 414 nm) per well was measured in the second plate to calculate total change at optical density of 414 nm per megakaryocyte, an indicator of late Meg-Pot activity. With this system, recombinant human erythropoietin showed both Meg-CSF and early and late Meg-Pot activities in in vitro megakaryopoiesis. Recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor possessed weak Meg-CSF and early Meg-Pot activity, whereas recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor exhibited late Meg-Pot activity and thrombocytopenic serum exhibited early and late Meg-Pot activities. This assay system is useful in screening Meg-CSF or Meg-Pot activities in unknown factors.\r"

We evaluated glomerular prostanoid formation, glomerular hemodynamics, and proteinuria in rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NSN) to test whether this beneficial effect of marine lipids also applies to other animal models of glomerular immune injury. Rats were fed diets (8 weeks) containing either cod liver oil or sunflower oil. NSN was induced with a rabbit anti-rat glomerular basement membrane antiserum. Antibody injection significantly stimulated glomerular thromboxane B2 (TxB2) formation in animals fed cod liver oil and sunflower oil at 2 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days. TxB2 production in glomeruli of sunflower oil rats, however, was five to seven times higher when compared with that in rats fed cod liver oil. The dietary regimen led to a significant decrease of glomerular TxB2 and prostaglandin E2 formation in the animals receiving cod liver oil when compared with those fed sunflower oil. Induction of NSN resulted in a significant fall of inulin clearance (Cin) and paraaminohippurate clearance at 2 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days in both groups. The decrease in Cin at 2 hours was greater in rats fed cod liver oil when compared with animals receiving sunflower oil (p less than 0.02); it was not different, however, at 24 hours and 7 days. Animals with NSN developed proteinuria. There was no difference in protein excretion between rats fed cod liver oil or those fed sunflower oil (days 2 and 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in sham-operated normal control and pair-fed groups of animals. Baseline glucose concentrations were similar in the three groups of animals. Plasma baseline insulin concentrations were significantly lower in the rats with renal failure and the pair-fed animals compared with the normal controls. After glucose challenge the renal failure group demonstrated glucose intolerance, which was not improved after naloxone treatment given 15 minutes before glucose challenge. Peak insulin levels after glucose challenge in the renal failure and pair-fed groups increased significantly after naloxone administration. Interestingly, circulating concentrations of plasma beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin were not significantly different in the three groups of animals when measured either in the baseline state or after glucose challenge. The data indicate that the carbohydrate intolerance in experimental renal failure may be partly due to an increase in pancreatic islet opioidergic tone, because an improvement in insulin secretion was demonstrated in the absence of any change in circulating beta-endorphin/beta-lipotropin concentrations after naloxone. The failure to demonstrate any improvement in glucose disposal after naloxone, despite the augmented secretion of insulin after naloxone in the animals with renal failure, points to peripheral resistance to the effects of insulin that is not influenced by opioid blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients who developed a confirmed infarction had a 1-year mortality rate of 12.8%. This was significantly higher than the mortality rate of 6.3% (P less than 0.001) in patients with possible infarction and it was also higher than that in patients with no infarction, which was 5.0% (P less than 0.001). A multivariate analysis showed that independent risk predictors in the clinical history of patients without confirmed infarction were a history of angina pectoris, chronic use of digitalis and advanced age. After 1 year, angina pectoris was most common in patients with an initial possible infarction. These patients were also in most urgent need of bypass surgery. We thus conclude that the mortality during 1 year of follow-up among patients with an initially strongly suspected acute myocardial infarction was clearly related to whether or not the patient developed a myocardial infarction.\r"

Blood pressure was measured at 15-min intervals for 90 min after administration of captopril. Blood samples for plasma renin determination were drawn immediately before and 90 min after drug administration. Eleven patients had renal artery stenosis. The fall in diastolic blood pressure in these patients was greater, on average, than in patients with other forms of hypertension (30 mmHg vs. 14 mmHg, P less than 0.01), as was the increase in plasma renin concentration (188 mU l-1 vs. 2 mU l-1, P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates that the short-term captopril test is useful for distinguishing patients with renovascular disease from those with other forms of hypertension. During the test, 7 patients (15%) exhibited reversible cerebral symptoms. In two of these subjects digital subtraction angiography was performed, which revealed stenosis of the carotid artery. Consequently, it is suggested that captopril should not be used in patients with arteriosclerotic stenoses of the carotids.\r"

We found that the areas of blood glucose (above basal) were identical irrespective of whether spaghetti was taken alone or as part of a mixed meal in both NIDDM (484 +/- 154 mmol l-1 240 min-1 vs. 393 +/- 126 mmol l-1 240 min-1) and IDDM subjects (610 +/- 143 mmol l-1 240 min-1 vs. 770 +/- 135 mmol l-1 240 min-1). The insulin levels were identical in the IDDM diabetics. By contrast, the mixed meal caused a more marked insulinaemic response than spaghetti per se in the NIDDM subjects (3187 +/- 637 mU l-1 240 min-1 vs. 1940 +/- 235 mU l-1 240 min-1; P less than 0.05). In conclusion, the predictive capability of the glycaemic response to spaghetti was good in both IDDM and NIDDM diabetic subjects, at least under the conditions of the present study.\r"

  ".W": "There is now agreement about the clinical features of panic disorder and agoraphobia but less agreement about treatment because of controversy over whether the disorder is primarily biological or psychological. The authors were requested to produce an impartial review for continuing education and peer review. We chose to do this by using a quantitative review procedure, by providing a bibliography of studies, and by a literature review. We found that symptoms of panic and phobia did not change significantly while on wait-list control or while receiving placebo. The evidence for the efficacy of the low-potency benzodiazepines or of monoamine oxidase inhibitors was limited. It was also clear that only limited improvement can be expected from behavior therapies that do not involve exposure to the symptoms of panic or to the feared situation. Symptoms of panic, as well as the frequency of spontaneous panic, were shown to be substantially improved following imipramine, high-potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, exposure in vivo (especially if a cognitive anxiety management procedure was used), and the combination of imipramine and exposure in vivo. The effects on panic produced by the exposure therapies (with or without imipramine) were maintained over long follow-up periods. Imipramine, alprazolam, exposure therapy, and imipramine plus exposure each produced significant improvements in phobias. In the short term and in the long term, the larger improvements in phobias were associated with exposure therapy, particularly if used in combination with imipramine. We conclude that it would be unwise to theorize about the etiology of this disorder on the basis of response to a specific treatment because, both at the meta-analytic level and from the review of individual studies, it is clear that both drug and nondrug therapies can produce substantial and long-lasting changes in panic and in phobias.\r"

External scintigraphy of cats that had been fed a meal of technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled rabbit liver and light cream allowed the measurement of the emptying rates of either the liquid or solid portion of a meal under physiologic conditions. In cats, liquids emptied 2.6 times faster than solids [163 +/- 11 min vs. 62 +/- 3 min (mean +/- s.e.)]. At 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o., MK-329 gastric emptying was significantly accelerated, with the mean half-time of emptying being decreased by 34 +/- 11% (mean +/- s.e.) of the control half-times (p less than 0.02). Using only responders (five of six animals), mean half-time was decreased by 55 +/- 4% of the control half-times. CCK is important in regulating the emptying of solid food from the stomach because the CCK antagonist MK-329 accelerates that emptying.\r"

Iodine-125-labeled RASK-3 was injected into nude mice with either human colon cancers (FCC-1 or BM-314) or lung cancer (KNS-62). Clear images were obtained in all three cancers 7 days after the injection of antibody. No localization of 125I-labeled control monoclonal antibody was observed. The ratio of tissue/blood radioactivity and % ID/g in the tumor were significantly higher than other organs by Day 8. The specific localization index examined by 131I-RASK-3 and 125I-control monoclonal antibody was also higher in the tumor than in other tissues. In the in vitro study, binding of RASK-3 to tumor cells increased significantly by treatment of cells with either lysolecithin or periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde, which confirmed the intracellular localization of ras p21. The mechanism by which anti-ras p21 antibodies accumulate in tumor sites could be the necrotic changes in tumor cells or changes in membrane permeability of non-necrotic cells. These results provide a strong rationale for the utilization of ras p21 as a target antigen in the imaging of a variety of human cancers.\r"

However, biliary activity was not completely eliminated as HPLC-purified 99mTc-MAG3 was also excreted by that route. Sequential 99mTc-DTPA and 99mTc-MAG3 renal scans were performed in 15 patients with renal dysfunction, including renal transplant recipients. In all cases, the 99mTc-MAG3 kit preparation provided superior images to 99mTc-DTPA at all levels of renal function due to a higher target-to-background ratio and a plasma clearance twice as fast as 99mTc-DTPA. Interpretation of delayed 99mTc-MAG3 images, however, was complicated by biliary excretion which will limit quantitative estimates of renal clearance. A 99mTc-MAG3 kit is likely to be of value in renal transplant assessment and in cases of significant renal impairment but would not appear to offer major advantages over 99mTc-DTPA in routine renal imaging.\r"

The need to do so was highlighted by nursing demand and shortage issues. Deliberate efforts to refine and to restructure patient care within a hospital necessitates multidisciplinary planning and problem solving, collaborative nurse/physician relationships, and sound recruitment/retention policies. The experience at one hospital shows how nurse executives can take ownership of issues that help to reduce nursing supply and demand problems. Restructuring of patient care is one method of addressing demand; supply can be addressed locally by collaborative relationships with schools of nursing to increase students' access to education. Enhancing professional nursing practice is the responsibility of nursing service executives as well as educators. Yet, ultimately, it is the hospital's professional environment and reward system that influences nurses' choice of practice setting.\r"

Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that i.v. replacement of nicotine will suppress daily intake of nicotine from ad libitum cigarette smoking and to compare the physiological effects of prolonged exposure to nicotine infused i.v. to the effect of smoking cigarettes throughout the day. Eight subjects received a 14-hr infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine dosed to achieve levels of nicotine similar to those while smoking cigarettes for each individual (average, 33.1 mg; range, 17.7-49.9 mg) or saline (placebo). Cigarette smoking was permitted as desired. Nicotine infusion did not significantly affect the number of cigarettes smoked or the amount of tobacco burned, but nicotine intake from cigarette smoking was suppressed in all but one subject by an average of 24.6% (range, 4.0-51.2%). Down-regulation of levels of nicotine while smoking in response to infusion of nicotine was imprecise, which may be a result of psychosocial factors influencing smoking behavior along with the development of tolerance to toxic effects of nicotine as a consequence of prolonged exposure to nicotine. Intravenous nicotine and cigarette smoking increased average heart rate and blood pressure throughout the day and 24-hr urinary epinephrine excretion to a similar extent. Despite higher levels of nicotine when subjects smoked during infusion of nicotine, there were no additional nicotine-related effects. No adverse effects were noted; most subjects could not distinguish nicotine from saline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Immunohistochemical studies have revealed the presence of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the guinea pig hippocampal mossy fiber projections, but this peptide appears to be absent in this system in the rat. However, in both species the mossy fiber system shows a strong opiate-like immunoreactivity. The present electrophysiological studies were undertaken to determine, in the two species, the effect of a unilateral colchicine-induced mossy fiber denervation, by comparing the responsiveness of target pyramidal neurons to Met-enkephalin, CCK and the nonpeptidic excitatory agents acetylcholine, kainate, quisqualate and ibotenate, on the intact and on the lesioned side. In both species, the colchicine lesion induced an increased responsiveness to Metenkephalin in the CA1 area, whereas no change was found in the neuronal responsiveness to the other excitatory agents tested. In the rat, the responsiveness of CA3 pyramidal neurons to kainate was reduced by 90%, those to the other excitatory agents were unchanged. In the guinea pig, the mossy fiber denervation induced a 10-fold increase of the responsiveness of CA3 pyramidal neurons to CCK, but did not modify their response to Met-enkephalin, kainate, quisqualate, ibotenate and acetylcholine. These results are consistent with the lack of CCK-like immunoreactivity in the mossy fiber projection to the CA3 region of the rat and with previous reports suggesting the presynaptic location of kainate receptors in this region. They provide novel evidence for the physiological role of CCK in the hippocampal mossy fiber projection in the guinea pig.\r"

The effects produced by i.v. and i.a. injections of 2-phenylaminoadenosine [CV-1808, adenosine (A2) selective agonist], 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA, nonselective agonist), 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO, A1 selective agonist) and cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, A1 selective agonist) were evaluated and compared to those of hydralazine. All agents produced hypotensive effects after bolus i.v. injection. Although CPA, NECA and 2-CADO elicited dose-dependent bradycardia, CV-1808 and hydralazine increased heart rate. These effects, with the exception of the hydralazine-evoked responses, were attenuated by prior treatment with 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (2 mg/kg/min), whereas both CV-1808 and hydralazine produced regional vasodilation, significant increases in blood flow occurred only after CV-1808 (3-30 micrograms/kg). The regional hemodynamic responses to NECA were more complex; low doses (0.1-1 microgram/kg) produced consistent reductions in regional vascular resistance, whereas at the highest dose renal vasoconstriction occurred. Although regional vasodilation occurred after 2-CADO, mesenteric vasoconstriction was observed subsequent to CPA administration. Whereas a significant increase in renin release was evident in animals treated with CV-1808 and hydralazine, no change occurred in response to the NECA-, 2-CADO- or CPA-induced hypotension. We conclude that the predominant hemodynamic response after selective activation of A2 receptors is one of regional vasodilation and hypotension leading to a reflex increase in heart rate and renin release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of varying the structure of philanthotoxin (PhTX) were investigated on binding of the channel blockers: [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin (H12-HTX) to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh-R) of Torpedo electric organ and [3H]MK-801 [( 3H]-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocyclo-hepten-5,10-imine maleate) to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) of rat brain cortex. The four moieties of PhTX (tyrosine, butyrate, spermine and the terminal amino group) were modified or conjugated resulting in 36 compounds. Although the potencies of the PhTX analogs on both receptors were higher with increasing lipophilicity and the polyamine chain length, there was considerable divergence between the two receptors' channels in the structural activity requirements for blockade by PhTX analogs. A major difference was the more critical role of the amine terminal for inhibition of the nACh-R than the NMDA-R, whereas the reverse might be true for the tyrosine moiety. The potency range of PhTX analogs on [3H]H12-HTX binding was 1070, but only 21 on [3H]MK-801 binding. Adding a lysine or arginine onto the spermine moiety increased the compound's potency on the nACh-R with little effect on the NMDA-R. Because spermine is a component of PhTX, the effects of five polyamines were also studied. Spermine and spermidine potentiated [3H]MK-801 binding, whereas putrescine, cadeverine and agmatine inhibited it. In presence of glutamate, higher concentrations of all polyamines inhibited [3H]MK-801 binding. On the nACh-R, spermine, spermidine and agmatine inhibited [125I]alpha-bungarotoxin and also [3H]H12-HTX binding in presence of carbamylcholine. The complex nature of PhTX interactions with the two receptors suggests that PhTX may bind to two sites: an external polyamine binding site and a channel binding site.\r"

  ".W": "A metabolite of arachidonic acid, 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), which can be formed either in the 12-S or 12-R configuration, has a diversity of biological actions and is generated by a number of tissues including the renal glomerulus and the vasculature. As the two isomers have been shown to differ in their effects on epithelial transport mechanisms and vascular responsiveness, we studied their direct effects on the rat isolated kidney, perfused for four consecutive 15-min clearance periods at a pressure of 90 mm Hg with a modified Krebs' buffer containing oncotic agents. At a dose of 20 nmol, both 12(S)- and 12(R)-HETE doubled urine volume (P less than .05) and sodium and potassium excretion rate in the first, postinjection clearance period. The effects of 12(R)-HETE were sustained during all three post-treatment clearance periods, whereas those of 12(S)-HETE were short-lived, excretion rates being similar to control values by the second post-treatment clearance period. At a higher dose of 40 nmol, 12(R)-HETE significantly reduced the usual rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate, characteristic of the rat isolated kidney, and caused an even greater initial increase in urine volume and sodium excretion rate than that achieved with 20 nmol. Renin concentration in the venous effluent was reduced immediately by 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETE (P less than .01), to approximately half of the control value. Again the response to the (R)-isomer was more prolonged. Thus, a 12-HETE of glomerular origin may alter renal function through direct and indirect tubular and hemodynamic effects.\r"

To test the possibility that one of the postulated subtypes of alpha-2 adrenoceptors is preferentially implicated in this response, we compared the interaction of several drugs with known selectivity toward alpha-2A or alpha-2B adrenoceptor subtypes in our model. The alpha-2A preferential agonist oxymetazoline induced in the mouse a hyperglycemic response similar to that of the nonselective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist UK 14.304. This hyperglycemic response to oxymetazoline was accompanied by a concomitant inhibition of insulin release. Both the effect on glycemic level and the inhibition of insulin release by oxymetazoline were antagonized by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. The alpha-2B preferential antagonists ARC-239, prazosin or chlorpromazine failed to block the modifications in both glycemic and insulin levels induced by alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation. The nonselective antagonists rauwolscine, yohimbine, WY 26703, phentolamine and corynanthine, as well as the receptor antagonists with alpha-2A selectivity like WB 4101, idazoxan and tolazoline, dose-dependently antagonized both the glycemic and the insulin responses to UK 14.304. A positive correlation was obtained between the potencies of these drugs in antagonizing the hyperglycemic response to UK 14.304 and their affinities for alpha-2A adrenergic receptors (r = 0.918, P less than .001) but no correlation was obtained with their affinities for alpha-2B adrenergic receptors (r = 0.048, P = N.S.)(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test the possibility that one of the postulated subtypes of alpha-2 adrenoceptors is differentially implicated in the inhibition of insulin release, we compared the effects of several agonists and antagonists with preferential selectivity for the alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtypes on the release of insulin induced by glucose in rat isolated islets. Similar to the inhibition of glucose-evoked release of insulin by the alpha-2 agonist (nonsubtype selective) UK 14.304, the alpha-2A preferential agonist oxymetazoline, concentration-dependently inhibited the release of insulin. Glucose-evoked insulin release was similarly inhibited by other alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine, p-aminoclonidine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. However, neither the alpha-1 selective agonist cirazoline, nor the beta adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol affected glucose-evoked insulin release, thus suggesting that this inhibitory effect is mediated by alpha-2 adrenoceptors, possibly of the alpha-2A subtype. The inhibition of glucose-evoked insulin release induced by the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists was concentration-dependently inhibited by the alpha-2 antagonists yohimbine, phentolamine, rauwolscine and idazoxan. However, neither the alpha-1 selective antagonist prazosin, nor the beta selective antagonist propranolol attenuated the inhibition of insulin release induced by alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists. Furthermore, the inhibition of insulin release induced by UK 14.304 was concentration-dependently antagonized by the alpha-2A preferential antagonist WB-4101.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of phencyclidine (PCP) on carbachol-induced phosphoinositol hydrolysis was examined in rat brain slices taken from cortex, caudate-putamen and hippocampus. In all three regions studied, PCP significantly inhibited carbachol-induced [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation working as low as 10(-6) M in the cerebral cortex. Because PCP has been shown to act at two sites, a PCP-site and a sigma site, various PCP-like agonists [levoxadrol (Lev), dexoxadrol (Dex) and MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro- 5H-dibenzo(a,b)cyclo-hepaten-5, 10-imine maleate]] as well as sigma agonists [(+)-SKF10047 and 1,3-di(2-toly)guanidine (DTG) were examined for their effects on carbachol-induced phosphoinositol hydrolysis. All but MK-801 significantly inhibited the carbachol action; however, their order of potencies, Lev greater than or equal to Dex much greater than PCP greater than or equal to DTG greater than or equal to (+)-SKF10047 differed from those of other known PCP interactions at PCP and sigma sites. Inasmuch as it is known that PCP competes for binding at muscarinic sites, we examined the effects of PCP, Lev, Dex, DTG and MK-801 on the binding of L-[3H]-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate to its muscarinic site. All blocked L-[3H]-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding and exhibited a rank order of potency almost identical to that obtained in the inositol studies with Lev greater than Dex much much greater than DTG much greater than PCP MK-801. In addition, the IC50 values obtained from both studies were very similar. It is concluded that PCP, PCP-like compounds and sigma agonists block carbachol-induced inositol-phosphate accumulation by blockade of muscarinic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The morphology of the RWM was analyzed 3 to 21 days after instillation of either substance. Both substances caused minor structural alterations at the light microscopic level. The RWM showed a slight thickening and an invasion of inflammatory cells. At the ultrastructural level, the CORT-treated specimens showed an increased epithelial height and numerous microvilli, whereas the epithelium of the LPS-treated specimens was extended and contained few microvilli resembling those in the normal RWM. We postulate that the RWM may undergo dynamic structural changes when exposed to various agents. The structural alterations per se can influence the passage of substances from the middle ear to the inner ear.\r"

  ".W": "Background. The effectiveness of calcium in retarding bone loss in older postmenopausal women is unclear. Earlier work suggested that the women who were most likely to benefit from calcium supplementation were those with low calcium intakes. Methods. We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine the effect of calcium on bone loss from the spine, femoral neck, and radius in 301 healthy postmenopausal women, half of whom had a calcium intake lower than 400 mg per day and half an intake of 400 to 650 mg per day. The women received placebo or either calcium carbonate or calcium citrate malate (500 mg of calcium per day) for two years. Results. In women who had undergone menopause five or fewer years earlier, bone loss from the spine was rapid and was not affected by supplementation with calcium. Among the women who had been postmenopausal for six years or more and who were given placebo, bone loss was less rapid in the group with the higher dietary calcium intake. In those with the lower calcium intake, calcium citrate malate prevented bone loss during the two years of the study; its effect was significantly different from that of placebo (P less than 0.05) at the femoral neck (mean change in bone density [+/- SE], 0.87 +/- 1.01 percent vs. -2.11 +/- 0.93 percent), radius (1.05 +/- 0.75 percent vs. -2.33 +/- 0.72 percent), and spine (-0.38 +/- 0.82 percent vs. -2.85 +/- 0.77 percent). Calcium carbonate maintained bone density at the femoral neck (mean change in bone density, 0.08 +/- 0.98 percent) and radius (0.24 +/- 0.70 percent) but not the spine (-2.54 +/- 0.85 percent). Among the women who had been postmenopausal for six years or more and who had the higher calcium intake, those in all three treatment groups maintained bone density at the hip and radius and lost bone from the spine. Conclusions. Healthy older postmenopausal women with a daily calcium intake of less than 400 mg can significantly reduce bone loss by increasing their calcium intake to 800 mg per day. At the dose we tested, supplementation with calcium citrate malate was more effective than supplementation with calcium carbonate.\r"

In the hippocampus it has recently been shown that long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory transmission can also be induced by certain combinations of synaptic activation. In most hippocampal and all neocortical pathways studied so far, the induction of LTP requires the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-gated conductances. Here we report that LTD can occur in neurons of slices of the rat visual cortex and that the same tetanic stimulation can induce either LTP or LTD depending on the level of depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. By applying intracellular current injections or pharmacological disinhibition to modify the depolarizing response of the postsynaptic neuron to tetanic stimulation, we show that the mechanisms of induction of LTD and LTP are both postsynaptic. LTD is obtained if postsynaptic depolarization exceeds a critical level but remains below a threshold related to NMDA receptor-gated conductances, whereas LTP is induced if this second threshold is reached.\r"

  ".U": "90370095\r", 
  ".W": "Receptors for dopamine have been classified into two functional types, D1 and D2. They belong to the family of receptors acting through G (or guanine nucleotide-binding) proteins. D2 receptors inhibit adenylyl cyclase, but D1 receptors stimulate adenylyl cyclase and activate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are targets of drug therapy in many psychomotor disorders, including Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, and may also have a role in drug addiction and alcoholism. D1 receptors regulate neuron growth and differentiation, influence behaviour and modify dopamine D2 receptor-mediated events. We report here the cloning of the D1 receptor gene, which resides on an intronless region on the long arm of chromosome 5, near two other members of the G-linked receptor family. The expressed protein, encoded by 446 amino acids, binds drugs with affinities identical to the native human D1 receptor. The presence of a D1 receptor gene restriction fragment length polymorphism will be helpful for future disease linkage studies.\r"

Pancreatic beta cells and a subpopulation of central nervous system neurons express high levels of this enzyme. Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase with a higher titre and increased epitope recognition compared with those usually associated with IDDM are found in stiff-man syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by a high coincidence with IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "Stimulation of T cells by antigen activates many signalling pathways. The capacity for this range of biochemical responses may reside in the complex structure of the seven-chain T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). In addition to the complexity shared by all TCRs, coexpression of zeta (zeta) and the distinct but related eta (eta) chains creates structural diversity among the TCR complexes expressed on a given cell. In most murine T cells that we have studied, about 90% of the heptameric receptor complexes contain a zeta zeta disulphide homodimer, whereas 10% contain a zeta eta disulphide heterodimer. Recent studies suggest that zeta has a critical role in allowing antigen to activate the cell, whereas eta expression has been correlated with the capacity for antigen-induced phosphoinositide turnover. A third zeta-related protein, the gamma (gamma) chain of the Fc epsilon and some Fc gamma receptors, exists as a disulphide homodimer in those complexes. The structural relatedness of zeta and gamma is emphasized by the recent demonstration of zeta zeta in association with CD16 in TCR-negative natural killer cells. Here we identify T cells lacking Fc receptors but coexpressing zeta, gamma, and eta, document the formation of novel heterodimers between zeta and gamma and between eta and gamma and show their association with the TCR. A greater range of homologous coupling structures than previously thought may be one way of achieving the variety of TCR-mediated (and possibly Fc receptor-mediated) biochemical responses and effector functions.\r"

In contrast to meiotic conversions observed in laboratory yeast strains, apparent conversions between polymorphic sequences, such as the class I loci of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), are short and do not seem to be associated with reciprocal recombination (crossover, exchanges). We have now integrated two nonallelic murine class I genes into yeast to characterize their meiotic recombination. We found no crossovers between the MHC genes, but short-tract 'microconversions' of 1-215 base-pairs were observed in about 6% of all meioses. Strikingly, one of these events was accompanied by a single base-pair mutation. These results underscore both the importance of meiotic gene conversion and sequence heterology in determining conversion patterns between divergent genes.\r"

Out of the 18 known aaRS, only 9 referred to as class I synthetases (GlnRS, TyrRS, MetRS, GluRS, ArgRS, ValRS, IleRS, LeuRS, TrpRS), display two short common consensus sequences ('HIGH' and 'KMSKS') which indicate, as observed in three crystal structures, the presence of a structural domain (the Rossman fold) that binds ATP. We report here the sequence of Escherichia coli ProRS, a dimer of relative molecular mass 127,402, which is homologous to both ThrRS and SerRS. These three latter aaRS share three new sequence motifs with AspRS, AsnRS, LysRS, HisRS and the beta subunit of PheRS. These three motifs (motifs 1, 2 and 3), in a search through the entire data bank, proved to be specific for this set of aaRS (referred to as class II). Class II may also contain AlaRS and GlyRS, because these sequences have a typical motif 3. Surprisingly, this partition of aaRS in two classes is found to be strongly correlated on the functional level with the acylation occurring either on the 2' OH (class I) or 3' OH (class II) of the ribose of the last nucleotide of tRNA.\r"

We analyzed the level of expression of the liver/beta-cell glucose transporter isoform in diabetic islets by immunofluorescence staining of pancreas sections and by Western blotting of islet lysates. Islets from diabetic animals have a reduced expression of this beta-cell-specific glucose transporter isoform and the extent of reduction is correlated with the severity of hyperglycemia. In contrast, expression of this transporter isoform in liver is minimally modified by the diabetes. Thus a decreased expression of the liver/beta-cell glucose transporter isoform in beta cells is associated with the impaired glucose sensing characteristic of diabetic islets; our data suggest that this glucose transporter may be part of the beta-cell glucose sensor.\r"

To study the molecular mechanism involved in the c-abl activation, we have created a series of modifications in murine c-abl and assayed these constructs for oncogenic activity using the NIH 3T3 cell transformation assay. Our results show that amino-terminal deletions are sufficient for oncogenic activation of c-abl and high levels of oncogenic activities were generated by a deletion of 114 codons from the 5' end that deleted the SH3 region. A deletion of 53 codons from the 5' end (inclusive of deletions seen in Hardy-Zuckerman 2 feline sarcoma virus and BCR-ABL gene products) that retains the SH3 region of c-abl resulted in the generation of low levels of transforming activity. This transforming potential was substantially increased with the introduction of a G----A point mutation in codon 832 that is present in v-abl. The point mutation was found to affect the secondary structure and the tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant gene products.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro synthesis of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) of dinitrogenase using homocitrate and its analogs allows the formation of modified forms of FeMo-co that show altered substrate specificities (N2, acetylene, cyanide, or proton reduction) of nitrogenase [reduced ferredoxin:dinitrogen oxidoreductase (ATP-hydrolyzing), EC 1.18.6.1]. The (1R,2S)-threo- and (1S,2S)-erythro-fluorinated diastereomers of homocitrate have been incorporated in vitro into dinitrogenase in place of homocitrate. Dinitrogenase activated with FeMo-co synthesized using threo-fluorohomocitrate reduces protons, cyanide, and acetylene but cannot reduce N2. In addition, proton reduction is inhibited by carbon monoxide (CO), a characteristic of dinitrogenase from NifV- mutants. Dinitrogenase activated with FeMo-co synthesized using erythro-fluorohomocitrate reduces protons, cyanide, acetylene, and N2. In this case proton reduction is not inhibited by CO, a characteristic of the wild-type enzyme. Cyanide reduction properties of dinitrogenase activated with FeMo-co containing either fluorohomocitrate diastereomer are similar, and CO strongly inhibits cyanide reduction. Dinitrogenases activated with FeMo-co containing homocitrate analogs with a hydroxyl group on the C-1 position are much less susceptible to CO inhibition of cyanide reduction. However, proton and cyanide reduction by dinitrogenase containing FeMo-co activated with (1R,2S) threo-isocitrate is only one-third that of dinitrogenase activated with the racemic mixture of -isocitrate and shows strong CO inhibition of substrate reduction. These results suggest that CO inhibition of proton and cyanide reduction occurs when the hydroxyl group on the C-1 position of analogs is \"trans\" to the C-2 carboxyl group (i.e., in the threo conformation). When racemic mixtures of these analogs are used in the system, it seems that the erythro form is preferentially incorporated into dinitrogenase. Finally, carbonyl sulfide inhibition of substrate reduction by dinitrogenase is dependent on the homocitrate analog incorporated into FeMo-co.\r"

The structure can be visualized on electron micrographs. Site- and strand-specific nicking at the transfer origin in vitro is dependent on the proteins TraI and TraJ and on Mg2+ ions. Substrate specificity is directed exclusively towards the cognate transfer origin: the RP4-specified TraJ protein cannot recognize the closely related oriT of plasmid R751. After nicking, TraI protein remains attached to the 5'-terminal 2'-deoxycytidyl residue at the nic site [Pansegrau, W., Ziegelin, G. & Lanka, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10637-10644]. Nicking and relaxosome formation require supercoiled DNA. Thus, a complicated structure involving multiple plasmid-specified proteins and a defined region of DNA must be formed at the transfer origin to prepare the plasmid for generating the single strand to be transferred.\r"

E. coli of bovine and porcine origin were marked by resistance to nalidixic acid (Nar) or rifampicin (Rfr), and a transferable, multiple resistance plasmid (pSL222-1 derivative of plasmid R222) was introduced by conjugation. In separate experiments, the two mutant derivatives were fed back to the respective host animals, which were housed adjacent to, but separate from, one or more \"recipient\" animals. No antibiotic was given. Although the Rfr derivatives declined rapidly to undetectable levels within 1 week, the Nar mutants of bovine and porcine origin persisted in the original hosts and in their bedding throughout most of each 4-month test period. Test bacteria were isolated from mice residing in the same pen as the donor animals and from multiple secondary hosts having direct or indirect contact with the inoculated donors, but not from neighboring animals maintained in isolation. The bovine mutant was excreted by two caretakers for greater than 4 weeks and was recovered for 4-6 weeks from pigs, fowl, and flies. Although the porcine mutant appeared to colonize less effectively, it spread rapidly to flies and mice and was recovered transiently from humans and fowl. Despite high transfer rates of plasmid pSL222-1 from E. coli K-12 in vitro, transfer of the plasmid from the animal E. coli host was very low and transfer in vivo was not detected among indigenous gut or environmental bacteria. E. coli of animal origin can spread rapidly and can colonize the intestinal tract of humans and of other animals in the absence of antibiotic selection.\r"

Unfortunately, identifying the homologous yeast gene with the two most commonly used approaches--DNA hybridization and antibody cross-reaction--is often difficult. We describe a strategy to identify yeast homologs based on protein function itself. This cloning-by-function strategy involves first identifying a yeast mutant that depends on a plasmid expressing a cloned foreign gene. The corresponding yeast gene is then cloned by complementation of the mutant defect. To detect plasmid dependence, the colony color assay of Koshland et al. [Koshland, D., Kent, J. C. & Hartwell, L. H. (1985) Cell 40, 393-403] is used. In this paper, we test the feasibility of this approach using the well-characterized system of DNA topoisomerase II in yeast. We show that (i) plasmid dependence is easily recognized; (ii) the screen efficiently isolates mutations in the desired gene; and (iii) the wild-type yeast homolog of the gene can be cloned by screening for reversal of the plasmid-dependent phenotype. We conclude that cloning by function can be used to isolate the yeast homologs of essential genes identified in other organisms.\r"

The computer program creates a negative image of the active site cavity using the crystal structure of the HIV-1 protease. This image was compared for steric complementarity with 10,000 molecules of the Cambridge Crystallographic Database. One of the most interesting candidates identified was bromperidol. Haloperidol, a closely related compound and known antipsychotic agent, was chosen for testing. Haloperidol inhibits the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases in a concentration-dependent fashion with a Ki of approximately 100 microM. It is highly selective, having little inhibitory effect on pepsin activity and no effect on renin at concentrations as high as 5 mM. The hydroxy derivative of haloperidol has a similar effect on HIV-1 protease but a lower potency against the HIV-2 enzyme. Both haloperidol and its hydroxy derivative showed activity against maturation of viral polypeptides in a cell assay system. Although this discovery holds promise for the generation of nonpeptide protease inhibitors, we caution that the serum concentrations of haloperidol in normal use as an antipsychotic agent are less than 10 ng/ml (0.03 microM). Thus, concentrations required to inhibit the HIV-1 protease are greater than 1000 times higher than the concentrations normally used. Haloperidol is highly toxic at elevated doses and can be life-threatening. Haloperidol is not useful as a treatment for AIDS but may be a useful lead compound for the development of an antiviral pharmaceutical.\r"

Understanding the mechanisms by which these oncogenes affect various cell types has been hampered by a paucity of experimental systems that reproduce the range of biological effects associated with them. We have developed an experimental system in which murine hematopoietic stem cell populations are infected with either v-abl or BCR/ABL retroviruses and are used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Irrespective of the form of activated abl, greater than 90% of the animals reconstituted with such cells develop tumors. About 50% of them develop a myeloproliferative syndrome that shares several features with the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia; the remaining animals succumb to pre-B-cell lymphomas. The myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized by large numbers of clonally derived, infected myeloid cells. This model will allow study of the mechanism by which activated abl genes affect hematopoietic precursors in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that introduction of an activated abl gene into the appropriate target cell, not the structure of the gene, is the major determinant in myeloid cell specificity.\r"

A genetic selection, with a dynamic range of 5 orders of proteolytic activity, was used to search 90,000 transformants of the library. Rapid screening for arginyl amidolysis and esterolysis confirmed the activity of the purified isolates. Trypsin and 15 mutant trypsins with partially preserved function were identified and characterized kinetically on arginyl and lysyl peptide substrates. Alternative arrangements of amino acids in the substrate binding pocket sustained efficient catalysis. A negative charge at amino acid position 189 or 190 was shown to be essential for high-level catalysis. With the favored aspartic acid residue at position 189, several amino acids could replace serine at position 190. Modulation of the specificity for arginine and lysine substrates was shown to depend on the amino acid at position 190. The regulatory effect of the amino acid side chain at position 190 on the substrate specificity is also reflected in substrate binding pockets of naturally occurring trypsin homologs.\r"

Characterization of the gene for OBF1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Northern and Southern blot analyses demonstrated that (i) the gene is located in chromosome IV, (ii) the gene is a single-copy gene, (iii) the mRNA is approximately 3.8 kilobases, which could code for an approximately 130-kDa polypeptide, consistent with the reported size of OBF1. An antibody, affinity-purified using the lysogen-encoded fusion protein, specifically detected an approximately 130-kDa polypeptide in yeast extract. The isolation of the gene for OBF1 should allow further analysis of the mechanism of action of this protein in vitro and in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Sequential effects on cellular protein expression following human immunodeficiency virus (type 1) infection of a CD4+ T-cell line in vitro were investigated. Events in the human interleukin 2-dependent helper T-cell line WE17/10 are similar in several respects to the clinical progression in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. WE17/10 cell infection is characterized by an extended period during which viral replication occurs without accompanying cytotoxicity and with a maximum 30% decrease in surface CD4. Cellular protein expression generally remains unaffected during this first phase of infection. However, after 2-3 months, a severe defect in the expression of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex both on the cell surface and inside the cell becomes apparent. Other cell membrane markers, such as CD2 and CD25, remain constant throughout the course of infection; after its initial decrease, CD4 remains at 70% of control values. Lack of surface expression of the TCR/CD3 complex is correlated with a specific defect in transcription of the CD3 gamma-chain gene.\r"

The model accounts for much of the phenomenology of the induction of long-term potentiation at a Hebbian synapse in hippocampal region CA1. Computer simulations suggested four important functions of spines in this Ca(2+)-dependent synaptic modification: (i) compartmentalizing transient changes in [Ca(2+)] to just those synapses that satisfy the conjunctive requirement for synaptic modification; (ii) isolating the spine head from changes in the [Ca(2+)] at the dendritic shaft; (iii) amplifying the concentration changes at those synapses; and (iv) increasing the voltage dependence of the processes underlying long term potentiation induction. This proposed role of spines in the regulation of Ca(2+) dynamics contrasts with traditional approaches to spine function that have stressed electronic properties. This model can be used to explore the computational implications of Hebbian synapses.\r"

Fluorescence microscopy indicated that the T7 RNA polymerase was present in the cytoplasmic compartment. The system provided, therefore, a unique opportunity to study structural elements of mRNA that affect stability and translation. The in vivo activity of the bacteriophage polymerase was demonstrated by transfection of a plasmid containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene flanked by T7 promoter and termination signals. Synthesis of CAT was dependent on the presence of a cDNA copy of the untranslated region of encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) RNA downstream of the T7 promoter, consistent with the absence of RNA-capping activity in the cytoplasm. CAT expression from a plasmid, pT7EMCAT, containing the T7 and EMCV regulatory elements was detected within 4 hr after transfection and increased during the next 20 hr, exceeding that obtained by transfection of a plasmid with the CAT gene attached to a retrovirus promoter and enhancer. Nevertheless, the presumably cap-independent transient expression of CAT from pT7EMCAT was increased more than 500-fold when the transfected cells also were infected with wild-type vaccinia virus. A protocol for high-level expression involved the infection of the T7 RNA polymerase cell line with a single recombinant vaccinia virus containing the target gene regulated by a T7 promoter and EMCV untranslated region.\r"

  ".W": "A lambda gt11 cDNA library prepared from bovine submaxillary gland mRNA was screened with polyclonal anti-apo-bovine submaxillary mucin antibodies with the aim of obtaining the deduced amino acid sequence of the mucin core protein. One of the positive clones had a 1.8 kilobase (kb) cDNA insert and coded for an incomplete protein. A 2.0-kb cDNA clone was isolated by rescreening the library with the 1.8-kb cDNA. Nucleotide sequencing of the full-length 2.0-kb cDNA revealed an open reading frame that coded for a 563-amino acid protein. A striking feature of the cloned protein is the skewed distribution of the amino acids, most notably that of the hydroxy amino acids and cysteine. The amino-terminal domain of 339 residues is very rich in threonine, serine, and glycine and poor in cysteine, aspartic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal domain of 224 residues is rich in cysteine, aspartic acid, tyrosine, lysine, and asparagine and relatively poor in threonine, serine, and glycine. A search of the protein data bank for homologies to the deduced amino acid sequence revealed statistically significant matches to several proteins, including the porcine submaxillary apomucin fragment. The cysteine-rich domain by itself was not statistically homologous with any of the registered polypeptide sequences. RNA blot analysis using DNA probes corresponding to the mucin-like and cysteine-rich regions detected a nearly identical pattern of transcripts, demonstrating that the characterized clones are not artifacts of cDNA library construction. The blots also showed the presence of polydisperse transcripts in bovine submaxillary gland but no detectable hybridization signals in liver or brain RNA.\r"

The protein, provisionally called cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF), was isolated from a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line that was induced to secrete lymphokines by culture with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore. The purification method, utilizing classical and high-performance liquid chromatographic techniques, yielded protein with a specific activity of 8.5 x 10(7) units/mg in a T-cell growth factor assay. Analysis of the purified protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that CLMF is a 75-kDa heterodimer composed of disulfide-bonded 40-kDa and 35-kDa subunits. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the two subunits revealed that both subunits are not related to any previously identified cytokine. Purified CLMF stimulated the proliferation of human phytohemagglutinin-activated lymphoblasts by itself and exerted additive effects when used in combination with suboptimal amounts of interleukin 2. Furthermore, the purified protein was shown to synergize with low concentrations of interleukin 2 in causing the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cells.\r"

  ".U": "90370874\r", 
  ".W": "Complement component C3a is an anaphylatoxin known to induce plasma exudation and smooth muscle contraction in tissues. The effects on inflammatory effector leukocytes, however, are poorly defined and controversial, being at best weak and occurring at very high C3a concentrations. Here, we examined the effect of C3a upon mediator release from human basophils, with and without pretreatment with interleukin 3 (IL-3), a hematopoietic growth factor recently found to profoundly modify the basophil response to various cell agonists. In the absence of cytokines, C3a, even at a concentration of 1 microM, was ineffective or only weakly stimulatory for basophil mediator release. However, when basophils were pretreated with IL-3 at concentrations of only 0.01-1 unit/ml, they became responsive to C3a, releasing large amounts of histamine and also generating leukotrienes. Surprisingly, almost optimal effects occurred with even very low C3a concentrations (1 nM). Another hematopoietic growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), was also found to render basophils capable of responding to C3a, but the effect was weaker than that of IL-3. C3a-induced histamine release and leukotriene generation occurred rapidly in IL-3-primed cells, being complete after 0.5 and 2 min, respectively. The rapid and strong degranulation response, occurring at very low concentrations of C3a, suggests the presence of a high-affinity C3a receptor on basophils, which might be inducible by cytokines. Our results demonstrate that, depending on the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF, C3a is a potent basophil activator, and such a phenomenon could be of relevance in various inflammatory processes, especially hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

In the present investigation we show that liver nuclei possess a marked ability to sequester and buffer Ca2+, suggesting a potential role for the nucleus in the regulation of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. In addition, we demonstrate that the intracellular messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins-(1,4,5)P3], stimulates the release of a fraction of the nuclear Ca2+ and transiently lowers the intranuclear free Ca2+ concentration. The Ins(1,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ release is followed by Ca2+ reuptake into an inositol phosphate-insensitive nuclear compartment. Together, these results demonstrate that liver nuclei contain, at least, two Ca2+ pools, one of which is releasable by Ins(1,4,5)P3. These findings are consistent with a role for the nucleus in the modulation of the cytosolic free Ca2+ level by agonists and suggest that the control of the nuclear Ca2+ load by second messengers may participate in the regulation of intranuclear Ca2(+)-dependent processes by hormones and other agents.\r"

Molecular analysis of RB1 mRNA from this cell line revealed a single point mutation within exon 21 that resulted in a nonconservative amino acid substitution (cysteine to phenylalanine) at codon 706. Stable expression of this mutant RB1 cDNA in a human cell line lacking endogenous RB1 demonstrated that this amino acid change was sufficient to inhibit phosphorylation. In addition, this cysteine-to-phenylalanine substitution also resulted in loss of RB1 binding to the simian virus 40 large tumor and adenovirus E1A transforming proteins. These results confirm the importance of exon 21 coding sequences and suggest that the cysteine residue at codon 706 may play a role in achieving a specific protein conformation essential for protein-protein interactions.\r"

A biologically based, computerized description of carcinogenesis was used to show that the increase in cell proliferation can account for the carcinogenicity of nongenotoxic compounds. The carcinogenic dose-response relationship for genotoxic chemicals (such as 2-acetylaminofluorene) was also due in part to increased cell proliferation. Mechanistic information is required for determination of the existence of a threshold for the proliferative (and carcinogenic) response of nongenotoxic chemicals and the estimation of risk for human exposure.\r"

In the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme-substrate complex, isocitrate forms a hydrogen bond with Ser113, the site of regulatory phosphorylation. The structures of Asp113 and Glu113 mutants, which mimic the inactivation of the enzyme by phosphorylation, show minimal conformational changes from wild type, as in the phosphorylated enzyme. Calculations based on observed structures suggest that the change in electrostatic potential when a negative charge is introduced either by phosporylation or site-directed mutagenesis is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme. Thus, direct interaction at a ligand binding site is an alternative mechanism to induced conformational changes from an allosteric site in the regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation.\r"

In addition, kainate-evoked conductances are potentiated in oocytes expressing two or more of the cloned receptor subunits. Electrophysiological responses obtained with certain subunit combinations show agonist profiles and current-voltage relations that are similar to those obtained in vivo. Finally, in situ hybridization histochemistry reveals that these genes are transcribed in shared neuroanatomical loci. Thus, as with gamma-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, native kainate-quisqualate-sensitive glutamate receptors form a family of heteromeric proteins.\r"

The kinetic results indicate that electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between the phosphoryl moiety and the gamma carboxyl group of 2R,3S-isocitrate are the major causes of the inactivation, with a lesser contribution from the loss of a hydrogen bond.\r"

The wild-type p53 stimulated transcription in this assay, but two transforming mutations in p53 were unable to act as transcriptional activators. Therefore, p53 can activate transcription, and transformation-activating mutations result in a loss of function of the p53 protein.

  ".W": "The post-translational processing of the yeast a-mating pheromone precursor, Ras proteins, nuclear lamins, and some subunits of trimeric G proteins requires a set of complex modifications at their carboxyl termini. This processing includes three steps: prenylation of a cysteine residue, proteolytic processing, and carboxymethylation. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the product of the DPR1-RAM1 gene participates in this type of processing. Through the use of an in vitro assay with peptide substrates modeled after a presumptive a-mating pheromone precursor, it was discovered that mutations in DPR1-RAM1 cause a defect in the prenylation reaction. It was further shown that DPR1-RAM1 encodes an essential and limiting component of a protein prenyltransferase. These studies also implied a fixed order of the three processing steps shared by prenylated proteins: prenylation, proteolysis, then carboxymethylation. Because the yeast protein prenyltransferase could also prenylate human H-ras p21 precursor, the human DPR1-RAM1 analogue may be a useful target for anticancer chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical characteristics of tumors metastatic to the orbit are related to primary tumor biology, and vary substantially among the various primary types. Common known primary sites include breast, lung, prostate, and melanoma. Tumor presentations can be classified into four generalized syndromes of mass, infiltrative, inflammatory, and functional effects. We found the infiltrative syndrome of presentation to be more common than for other types of orbital neoplasm. Accurate diagnosis often depends on recognition of the types of clinical syndromes and on the use of diagnostic modalities such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, fine needle aspiration biopsy, and open biopsy. Special histologic techniques are often useful in determining the origin of these often poorly differentiated tumors, and can provide a basis for specific hormonal therapy. Ophthalmologists play a vital role in the diagnosis of metastatic cancer; the orbital tumor was the presenting sign of systemic cancer in 42% of the cases reviewed. Although the overall prognosis for patients with metastatic cancer is quite poor, specific therapy is available for a growing number of cancers. Timely intervention based on accurate diagnosis can dramatically improve the duration and quality of life with selected tumors.\r"

The most salient effect of lens wear is the hypoxically induced reduction in the rate of metabolic activity of the corneal epithelium and its sequellae. Other important alterations to corneal health associated with contact lens wear may be caused by antigenic and toxic stimuli, mechanical forces, osmotic effects and carbon dioxide retention. Perhaps the most important task facing the contact lens clinician is to distinguish between an acceptable state of physiological modification and an anomalous or pathological state of hypofunction. In this article, we review the assortment of corneal changes primarily on the basis of the causative agents and time scale with reference to the physical and chemical processes leading to the observed signs or symptoms. This procedure allows a strong foundation for understanding the etiology and management principles for the variety of effects that contact lenses may have on the cornea.\r"

  ".W": "Immune privilege in the anterior chamber of the eye, no longer considered a laboratory curiosity, results from an active, if deviant, systemic immune response. The specific features of this response, termed Anterior Chamber Associated Immune Deviation (ACAID) include (a) suppressed delayed hypersensitivity, (b) preserved humoral immunity, and (c) primed cytotoxic T cell responses. Induction of ACAID by intraocular antigens depends upon unique characteristics of the anterior segment of the eye and of the spleen. Evidence from animal models is presented in support of the contention that ACAID is an evolutionary adaptation of the immune response designed to provide those types of immune protection for the eye that interfere with vision as little as possible. ACAID may also have been created for the purpose of avoiding harmful immune responses (autoimmune diseases) to unique molecules of the eye (such as retinal S antigen), which the immune system never learns to regard as \"Self.\" Because of this adaptation, the eye and the host are vulnerable to those pathogens whose elimination is dependent upon delayed hypersensitivity, such as malignant tumors and herpes simplex virus-1. As we come to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ACAID, a new generation of therapeutic strategies may be envisioned for certain eye diseases which are now of enigmatic cause and submit poorly to conventional therapy.\r"

Patients who have undergone ileorectal operations for familial polyposis can be useful to study hypotheses on prevention of colon cancer. In this study we evaluated the effect of long-term calcium supplementation on risk markers of colon cancer. Thirty-one patients with familial polyposis, after subtotal colectomy, were randomized to group A, which received placebo, and group B, which received 1200 mg of calcium daily. Intervention lasted 9 months, in which they underwent four 3-monthly evaluations that included food records, fecal pH, calcium and bile acids, and rectal biopsy for thymidine labeling. Age, height, weight, macronutrients, and dietary fiber were comparable in both groups. More women were in the group that received placebo. Fecal pH, weight, and bile acid levels were similar before intervention and remained unchanged. Fecal calcium levels were similar before intervention and increased in the calcium group throughout the study (p less than 0.05). Labeling index of placebo and calcium groups was similar before intervention (4.8 and 6.1, respectively). After 3 months it was reduced in both groups (3.1 and 4.4, respectively; p less than 0.05). After 6 months it was reduced only in the calcium group (3.4; p less than 0.05). After 9 months it did not differ from the starting point (3.4 and 4.0, respectively). In a long-term intervention study with a homogenous group of patients with familial polyposis, supplemental dietary calcium did not affect mucosal risk factors for colon cancer.\r"

Despite the best treatments available, present-day resection modalities are usually still not radical. Extension of resection in the retrohilar and hepatoduodenal direction might further improve the long-term surgical results.\r"

Because the normal anatomic relationship of the parathyroid glands to the thyroid gland was absent, preoperative localization studies were necessary. Ultrasonography, radionuclide scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging all indicated a right paratracheal mass in the region where the right lobe of the thyroid gland should be located. At operation, a single, enlarged parathyroid gland that measured 1.5 X 1.2 X 0.5 cm and weighed 500 mg was removed.

Pulmonary clearance of inhaled technetium-99m labelled diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) was measured in seven patients with a history of extrinsic allergic alveolitis but with no symptoms at the time of the study and in 12 control subjects. Monoexponential clearance curves were obtained in all 12 control subjects. In contrast, lung clearance was abnormal in five of the seven patients: biexponential clearance curves were noted in four and an abnormally rapid monoexponential curve in one. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in all patients. Fluid from the second and third aliquots showed increased concentrations of albumin and urea in fluids from the patients, suggesting increased plasma leakage through the alveolocapillary membranes. More eosinophils and more eosinophil cationic protein were also found in the lavage fluid from the patients. The trend towards increased numbers of eosinophils in patients with abnormal lung clearance of DTPA suggests that this may be due to a continuing inflammatory reaction. Lung inflammation was also suggested by the fact that less leukotriene B4 was secreted by cultured alveolar macrophages obtained from patients than by control macrophages. It is concluded that symptom free patients with previous extrinsic allergic alveolitis have continuing alveolar disease as shown by lung clearance and lavage findings.\r"

The word \"lacune\" means a small stroke. While the immediate mortality rate from a small stroke is low, many patients are unable to return to work and the long-term prognosis is guarded. Photochemical damage to the carotid artery of rats produces microemboli to the brain, resulting in cavitary lesions resembling lacunes in humans. The \"lacune hypothesis\" is a fallacy because small cerebral infarcts are not caused solely by a combination of hypertension and small vessel disease, and the various \"lacunar syndromes\" are simply small strokes which should be investigated as such.\r"

Their mean +/- SD increase in blood flow velocity in 54 middle cerebral arteries 10 minutes after stimulation was 24.4 +/- 9.2 cm/sec. We tried to validate the increase in blood flow velocity as cerebrovascular reserve capacity in 21 patients with obstructive carotid artery disease and symptoms of cerebral ischemia. The patients were studied using transcranial Doppler sonography and xenon-133 dynamic single-photon emission computed tomography after acetazolamide stimulation. Their increases in blood flow velocity (delta FV) and increases in cerebral blood flow (delta CBF) correlated significantly in both hemispheres (asymptomatic: Y = 0.32X + 10.65, r = 0.45, p = 0.04; symptomatic: Y = 0.36X + 2.28, r = 0.59, p = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the slopes of the regression lines. Blood flow velocity and cerebral blood flow at rest were not correlated. The increase in blood flow velocity after acetazolamide stimulation offers a simple and reliable method for assessing cerebrovascular reserve capacity.\r"

Laser-Doppler probes continuously recorded regional cerebral blood flow at two or three sites over the parietal cortex (dura intact) while brain temperature was regulated at 37 degrees C. Occlusion of the right middle cerebral and common carotid arteries reduced cerebral blood flow to a mean of 38% (range 13-77%) of baseline. Thirty minutes later, either 2 micrograms/kg/min nimodipine (n = 8) or its vehicle, polyethylene glycol 400 (n = 8), was administered by a continuous intravenous infusion.

All specimens were obtained from uterine curettages performed at the time of the initial diagnosis or initial therapy. The ER and PR content in the malignant and benign components (benign epithelium, stroma, and myometrium) was evaluated separately for positivity and divided into three groups according to the percentage of positive cells and the intensity of the nuclear stain. Endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma had the highest degree of positivity for both receptors, followed by adenosquamous carcinoma, serous carcinoma, and clear cell carcinoma. The positivity for ERs and PRs of the malignant component was statistically correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (P less than 0.01), FIGO grade (P less than 0.001), and nuclear grade (P less than 0.0001) of the tumors. The degrees of ER and PR positivity of the malignant component correlated with each other (P less than 0.0001). There was no association between the depth of myometrial tumor invasion and either receptor status of the malignant component. There was a significant association between the presence of lymph vessel invasion and the positivity for PR. Positivity for PR correlated negatively with the patients' ages (P less than 0.004). The results of this study indicate that immunohistochemical analysis of sex steroid receptor status on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue offers an excellent alternative to the standard biochemical procedure.\r"

Biochemical analysis was done on a homogenate of uterine curettings; immunohistochemical stainings were done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. The biochemical method was scored quantitatively and the immunohistochemical, in a semiquantitative way. There was a significant correlation between the immunohistochemical categories of the malignant component of the tumor and the biochemical levels of receptor content (P = 0.0001). The sensitivity of the immunohistochemical method for the ER content was 78.5% and the specificity was 58.2%. The sensitivity for the PR was 52.5% and the specificity was 92.8%. Changing cut-off levels for positivity of the biochemical analysis changed the sensitivity and specificity. Survival was predicted by the immunohistochemical status of the ER (P = 0.001) and PR (P = 0.01). Similarly, it was predicted by the biochemical receptor status. Multivariate analysis of the immunohistochemical receptor status and the biochemical receptor status showed that the immunohistochemically determined estrogen status was the most significant predictor of survival (P = 0.001).

Relationships between morphologic characteristics and AE1 reaction patterns were analyzed in carcinomas and adjacent epithelium. Infiltrating carcinomas had three types of AE1 patterns that paralleled degrees of differentiation. Type 1 pattern was present in well-differentiated carcinomas characterized by cytoplasmic staining of polyhedral cells. Types 2 and 3 were seen in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas in different percentages, characterized by all cancer cells stained, with cellular membrane and cytoplasm stained or all unstained, respectively. In normal esophageal epithelium, basal cells were the major population that was AE1 positive. In hyperplasia basal cells showed two kinds of changes, either reduced/lost AE1 staining accompanied by AE1 expression in spinous cells or retained/increased AE1 reactivity. In dysplasia and carcinoma in situ, abnormal cells had reaction patterns in which they lost or increased AE1 expression. Findings indicate that different degrees of differentiation of infiltrating esophageal carcinoma cells have differing expressions of cytokeratins and that monoclonal antibody AE1 can serve as a biomarker identifying early abnormalities in esophageal epithelial cells having increased predisposition to malignancy. Molecular mechanisms of AE1 cytokeratin expression in esophageal epithelium are also discussed.\r"

A correlation between the different degrees of rejection reaction and subtypes of monocyte/macrophage infiltrates was established. Early and mild rejection is characterized by recently immigrated monocytes/macrophages positive for the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1. In contrast, the cellular infiltrates in severe and resolving rejection show strong expression of antigens recognized by Ki-M6 and Ki-M8, indicating increased phagocytotic function of monocytes/macrophages. The immunohistochemical assessment of monocytes/macrophages can thus be used, in addition to conventional histology, in the diagnosis of cardiac allograft rejection.\r"

The independent interpretations of the FS and FC IT results were concordant in 93% (202 of 218) of cases. The 16 cases with discordance were reviewed and seven causes for discrepancy found: methodologic problems, focal lymphomatous involvement, more sensitive light chain detection by FC, inadequate sample for FC, interpretation error, sample mislabeling for FC, and unexplained. Eleven of the concordant B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) studied by FC did not have a kappa:lambda ratio of 3 or greater or 0.5 or less and were shown to express light chain restriction by a D-value of 15 or greater with the use of statistical analysis of the kappa and lambda histograms or by multiparameter analysis of large versus small cells. The authors found both methods to be effective for phenotyping lymphomas, however, each has distinct features, making them complementary in their applications.\r"

  ".W": "Routinely processed bone marrow biopsies of 59 patients with untreated multiple myeloma (MM) and of 41 patients with monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) were immunocytochemically studied with the MB2 monoclonal antibody. In 54 of 59 biopsies of patients with MM, most neoplastic plasma cells showed strong cytoplasmic positivity to MB2. In contrast, only three biopsies of patients with MGUS contained highly MB2-positive plasma cells, whereas the plasma cells in the remaining biopsies were either negative (18 of 41) or revealed a weak dot-like staining of the cytoplasm (20 of 41). Plasma cells in tonsillar tissue, gastric and duodenal mucosae, and bone marrow with reactive plasmacytosis were not stained with MB2. These findings suggest that MB2 helps to distinguish between MM and MGUS. Because the five MB2-negative patients with MM were all in stage III and had very short survival time, neoplastic plasma cell staining with MB2 could also have a prognostic significance.\r"

Thirty-two cases of fungal infections, granulomatous inflammation, and sarcoidosis were used as negative controls. Sections stained with the use of antibodies raised against Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), Mycobacterium duvalii (MD), and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis (MP) were compared with Kinyoun and Fite-stained tissue sections. In caseating granulomata, clumps of mycobacterial debris, cells, and cell fragments stained. In histiocytic granulomata of mycobacterial infections, histiocyte cytoplasm contained both organisms and debris. The three antibodies showed cross-reactivity against the four groups of mycobacteria tested. Mycobacterial staining using immunoperoxidase was apparent in most cases at low-power (scanning) magnification. Thirty-two of 34 cases of mycobacterial infection, including all 24 Kinyoun-Fite-positive cases, were positive for immunoreactive organisms and debris using anti-MD, anti-BCG, and/or anti-MP. Eight of ten cases of culture-proven mycobacterial infection, in which Kinyoun and Fite stains were negative, had immunoreactive organisms or antigen with anti-BCG, MD, or MP. The antibodies also stained organisms in five cases of sporotrichosis in which the organisms were identified as yeast forms in tissue sections.\r"

The authors report on two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and one patient with immunodeficiency after anti-T-cell treatment for rejection of a heart transplant, in which the area surrounding the central arteriole in spleen white pulp was well-populated despite T-cell deficiency (documented by, for example, severe depletion of lymph node paracortex). Immunologic phenotyping showed the B-lymphoid lineage of lymphocytes at this location. The framework in the periarteriolar area consisted of follicular dendritic cells, which are typical framework components of B-cell areas. We conclude that assessment of only conventional histopathology of the spleen in these patients leads to erroneous conclusions about the type of immunodeficiency and that immunologic phenotyping is required to document the exact nature of the deficiency.\r"

In 77 patients with acute Candida vaginitis, the SLA test revealed a positive reaction in 56 patients, reflecting a sensitivity of 72.7%, lower than that observed with the 10% potassium hydroxide microscopic examination (sensitivity 90%). False negative SLA reactions could not be accounted for by lower numbers of yeast cultured from the vagina or by the presence of nonalbicans strains of Candida. Following successful antimycotic therapy, the SLA test promptly became negative in all mycologically negative patients. Application of the SLA test in asymptomatic healthy control women revealed extremely few false positive reactions for Candida (5.6%). This easily performed and rapid slide latex agglutination test should provide a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of Candida vaginitis, but only for physicians who do not routinely perform microscopy on vaginal secretions.\r"

The advances stem from the ability to define the developmental stages and describe the diseases at the gene level. Coordinate with this progress, recombinant DNA technology may soon permit the precise correction of the defect. For the moment, gene replacement is accomplished at the cellular level by bone marrow transplantation. Here too, rapid clinical advances now permit the use of nonsibling donors. The long-term results are equivalent to those obtained in the past when only HLA-matched siblings could donate. There is now a support group that is of inestimable value to the families of those who suffer from immunodeficiency. Thus, there has been both technological and social progress in the area of primary immunodeficiency. The future is clearly brighter each year.\r"

The retrobulbar area of the optic nerve shadow on B-scan was quantitated with a sonic digitizer. Increased optic nerve shadow area was confirmed in 13 of 15 patients who had radiation optic neuropathy (P less than .004). The correct diagnosis was confirmed when the results of ultrasound were compared to fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. In 13 patients there was acute radiation optic neuropathy. Two patients did not show an enlarged retrobulbar optic nerve, and the clinical appearance suggested early progression to optic atrophy. Ultrasonography documents the enlargement of the optic nerve caused by acute radiation changes.\r"

We also removed a posterior chamber intraocular lens in a 73-year-old woman who had an epithelial downgrowth three months postoperatively. In the first two cases, only one of four haptics was successfully positioned in the sulcus. Histologic study disclosed a thin fibrous capsule surrounding the haptics at their attachment site, no inflammation around the transscleral portion of the suture, and exposure of a suture tip externally. In the third case, the intraocular lens fell back into the vitreous cavity after the fixation sutures were cut externally at the time of surgical removal. Stability of the lens in all three cases was primarily a result of intact transcleral sutures and not fibrous encapsulation or ciliary sulcus placement of haptics.\r"

However, little attention has been directed to the possibility of vascular injury caused by the perforating object. Isolated case reports have described significant morbidity and mortality subsequent to major vascular trauma resulting from an esophageal foreign body, usually emphasizing the presence of a \"signal\" hemorrhage from the gastrointestinal tract as a key to diagnosis. This report describes a case of esophageal perforation caused by an ingested fishbone that resulted in significant aerodigestive hemorrhage, possibly as the result of an unusual isolated vascular injury. The literature on vascular trauma following foreign body perforation of the esophagus is reviewed, and suggestions for the diagnosis and treatment of these dreaded complications are made.\r"

On surgical removal of the silicone implants, and their replacement with saline-filled implants, the scleroderma gradually resolved. Histopathologic examination of the removed implant capsules revealed evidence of silicone leakage. All new female patients with scleroderma should be questioned and examined regarding augmentation mammoplasty. Until prospective studies are completed on the possible association between scleroderma and silicone breast implants, it would seem prudent to use the saline-filled, elastomeric envelope-type breast implant for augmentation mammoplasty rather than the silicone gel-filled implant.\r"

  ".W": "The techniques and indications for lung transplantation have evolved significantly in the past 6 years. We initially restricted single-lung transplantation to patients with pulmonary fibrosis and developed the double-lung transplantation procedure for patients with emphysema or cystic fibrosis. However, with the double-lung procedure, a 25% mortality rate resulted from ischemic complications at the tracheal anastomosis. The technique was altered to incorporate bilateral bronchial anastomosis, with a resulting reduction in airway complications. The double-lung transplantation procedure continued to have significant drawbacks, including intraoperative and postoperative hemorrhage, and cardiac complications due to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, ischemic cardiac arrest, and extensive manipulation of the heart. These problems recently have been addressed with a much simplified procedure incorporating a bilateral transverse thoracosternotomy, replacement of the right lung without cardiopulmonary bypass, and replacement of the left lung with or without a short period of partial bypass. This procedure has been successfully used for emphysema and for cystic fibrosis. The technique of single-lung transplantation also has been simplified and indications have been expanded to include selected patients with emphysema and with primary pulmonary hypertension. With single-lung transplantation, each of the lungs from a donor has been successfully used for a separate recipient on several occasions, improving the supply of available donor organs.\r"

  ".W": "A 3-year prospective trial of laser thermal-assisted balloon angioplasty in 28 patients included 27 who had advanced peripheral vascular disease (severe tissue loss, gangrene, infection, and rest pain), 7 who were failures of previous therapy (surgery and thrombolysis), and 4 who were high risk for operation (myocardial infarction within 6 weeks and/or ejection fractions of less than or equal to 20%). Laser angioplasty was performed in the operating room via a groin incision by a surgeon-radiologist team. In the 27 patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease (ankle-brachial systolic pressure index [ABI] 0.27 +/- 0.2 in 10 nondiabetic, and 0.46 +/- 0.1 in 17 diabetic patients), recanalization of the native vessel was successful in 16, and patency was restored in 2 chronically occluded polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) grafts. In these 18 (67%) successfully recanalized patients, however, five amputations were required within 1 month, and another six were needed between 8 and 12 months. Early amputations were caused by a failure of wound healing, even through angioplasty sites were patent. Late amputations were caused by reocclusion of the treated site in five of six patients. In the remaining seven patients in whom laser angioplasty alone was successful, five had healed limbs at 6 to 24 months and two remain incompletely healed but functional. The patency for successful procedures ranged from 48 hours to 25 months (5.6 +/- 6.4 mean months, +/- SD), with cumulative patency by life-table analysis of 55.5% at 3 months, 38.8% at 6 months, and 11.1% at 12 months. There were no procedure-related deaths. Complications included seven arterial wall perforations by the laser probe. We conclude that laser angioplasty has a limited role in advanced peripheral vascular disease but may provide an interval patency, thus allowing postponement of operation for high-risk patients until their medical conditions permits surgery, or to correct local tissue necrosis or infection in the operative field before reconstruction, and to restore patency to thrombosed PTFE grafts.\r"

Similar major histocompatibility complex class II-bearing dendritic-shaped leukocytes are contained within transplanted organs and these are thought to be important passenger leukocytes that trigger rejection. Recent findings on the migration, phenotype, and function of cardiac dendritic leukocytes (DLs) are reviewed. After transplantation donor DLs migrate rapidly from mouse cardiac allografts into the recipients's spleens. Within the spleens donor DLs associate with recipient CD4+ T cells. Isolated cardiac DLs, like lymphoid dendritic cells, are potent stimulators of T-cell proliferation in vitro. This suggests that DLs function as passenger leukocytes by migrating from grafts into the lymphoid tissues of the recipient and that sensitization to vascularized organ allografts may occur centrally within lymphoid tissues rather than peripherally in the graft itself.\r"

We believe that the subject at issue is whether magnesium sulfate should be used in treating the seizures of eclampsia. In our \"Controversies\" article, we do not address the issue of whether magnesium sulfate modifies pathophysiological factors leading to preeclampsia, but restrict ourselves to the treatment of the seizure per se, once seizures supervene, and the avoidance of their recurrence. The pathophysiological mechanisms and optimal treatment of preeclampsia and of eclampsia (excepting seizures) remain to be determined, as does the use of magnesium sulfate in this condition. Eclamptic seizures are clinically and electroencephalographically indistinguishable from generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Whether seizures arise in or out of the setting of preeclampsia, they should be treated as are other seizures, with known anticonvulsants. Controlled clinical trials are needed to address the effectiveness of alternative antiseizure regimens.\r"

Parameters measured included: flow velocity (mean, maximum, and peak systolic), flow acceleration, systolic-to-diastolic ratio, and pulsatility index. Patients with 75% to 100% stenosis had lower average ipsilateral flow acceleration and mean velocity than did normal subjects. Correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between degree of stenosis and ipsilateral flow acceleration, as well as ipsilateral mean velocity. These correlations were no longer significant when we excluded normals, however. There was a linear relationship between right and left velocity values for both normal subjects and patients with occlusion but not for patients with stenosis. This technique has potential for the reliable assessment of the hemodynamic effect of carotid stenosis on intracranial circulation.\r"

Although the theoretical possibility exists for HIV-1 transmission through other routes, including non-percutaneous, non-sexual modes often referred to as 'casual' contact (and several anecdotal reports suggest this possibility), there is no credible epidemiological evidence to support this. Fourteen combined surveys, with over 750 individuals with potential exposure through non-percutaneous, non-sexual modes of contact, have failed to find a single case of HIV-1 infection (upper bound of 95% confidence interval = 0.40%), indicating that the risk of transmission by non-percutaneous, non-sexual modes is remote. Given the emotionally charged concerns about transmission of an infection which may end fatally in a high proportion of affected individuals, critical review of the low probability of transmission through non-percutaneous, non-sexual modes is important so that preventive efforts can be focused appropriately.\r"

  ".W": "Increasing evidence suggests that the renin-angiotensin system modulates cardiovascular homeostasis both via its circulating, plasma-borne components and through locally present, tissue-resident systems with site-specific activity. The existence of such a system in the heart has been proposed, based on biochemical studies as well as on the demonstration of renin and angiotensinogen messenger RNA in cardiac tissue. We conducted the present study to determine whether biologically active angiotensin peptides may be cleaved within the heart from locally present angiotensinogen. Isolated, perfused rat hearts were exposed to infusions of purified hog renin; the coronary sinus effluent was collected and subsequently assayed for angiotensin I (Ang I) and angiotensin II (Ang II) by high-pressure liquid chromatography and specific radioimmunoassay. Both Ang I and II were undetectable under control conditions but appeared promptly after the addition of renin. Dose-dependent peak values for Ang I release ranged from 2.42 +/- 0.65 fmol/min to 1.38 +/- 0.18 pmol/min during renin infusions at concentrations between 10 microunits/ml and 5 milliunits/ml. Ang II levels measured in the perfusate reflected a mean fractional intracardiac conversion of Ang I to Ang II of 7.18 +/- 1.09%. Generation of Ang I and Ang II was inhibited in the presence of specific inhibitors of renin and converting enzyme, respectively. To investigate the source of angiotensinogen, we measured spontaneous angiotensinogen release from isolated perfused hearts. In the absence of renin in the perfusate, angiotensinogen was initially released in high, but rapidly declining, concentrations and subsequently at a low, but stable, rate. Prior perfusion with angiotensinogen-rich plasma resulted in enhanced early angiotensinogen release but did not alter the second, delayed phase, suggesting that, in addition to plasma-derived substrate, locally produced angiotensinogen may also participate in the intracardiac formation of angiotensin. Supporting this interpretation, hearts from animals pretreated with dexamethasone showed increased angiotensinogen messenger RNA concentrations as well as increased rates of angiotensinogen release not only during the early but also during the late phase. Our study newly demonstrates that Ang I and II may be formed within the isolated heart from locally present substrate, which appears to be derived in part from the circulating pool and in part from endogenous synthesis. These findings add support to the concept of a functionally active and locally integrated cardiac renin-angiotensin system and emphasize its potential physiological and pathological relevance.\r"

Acute myocarditis occurred in both nu/nu and nu/+ mice. Severe myocarditis, however, developed only in nu/+ and nu/nu mice reconstituted with CB3-sensitized T cells, but not in those reconstituted with EMC-sensitized T cells. Myocardial virus titer and serum anti-CB3 antibody production were similar in nu/+ and nu/nu groups. Additionally, the presence of Thy 1.2 (pan T), Ly 1 (precursor of other T cell subsets), and Ly 2 (suppressor/cytotoxic T) positive cells was demonstrated in the myocardium in nu/+ and nu/nu mice reconstituted with CB3-sensitized T cells, but not with T cells sensitized by another virus, EMC.

To determine the time course of intimal and medial SMC proliferation and morphological changes after experimental angioplasty, an intimal atheroma was produced with repeated weak electrical stimulations in the right carotid artery of 45 male New Zealand White rabbits. Angioplasty was subsequently performed in 35 rabbits, and the proliferative responses were analyzed with histomorphological and immunohistological criteria at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after intervention. A hemodynamic relevant stenosis after angioplasty was found in eight (23%) of 35 dilated arteries. In five rabbits the stenosis was due to a mural thrombus, and in three animals restenosis was caused by intimal SMC proliferation. In all dilated arteries the intimal wall thickness increased from 13 +/- 5 intimal cell layers (after electrical stimulation) to 33 +/- 14 cell layers during 28 days after angioplasty (p less than 0.05). Later than 4 weeks after angioplasty, no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. Application of bromodeoxyuridine 18 and 12 hours before excision of the vessels allowed determination of the percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis in the intima and media using monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. SMCs were identified by alpha-actin staining. Immunohistological quantification of intimal SMC proliferation showed a maximum of cells undergoing DNA synthesis within the first 7 days after angioplasty (p less than 0.01). In contrast, medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and showed a small but significant increase 21 days after dilatation (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although protein kinase C and its substrate protein have been identified in both membrane and cytosolic fractions in the heart, the physiological role of this kinase in the regulation of cardiac function remains unknown. We examined the physiological role of protein kinase C by stimulating its activity with 12-deoxyphorbol 13 isobutyrate 20 acetate (DPBA) in human trabeculae carneae. This resulted in decreased peak isometric twitch force and peak intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release as detected with aequorin. Furthermore, in the presence of DPBA, steady-state force-[Ca2+] relations were shifted to higher intracellular calcium concentrations, and the Hill coefficient was reduced, indicating a decrease in responsiveness of the myofilaments to calcium and a change in cooperativity among thin filament proteins, respectively. Thus, DPBA affects not only intracellular calcium concentration, but myofilament calcium interactions as well. The effect of DPBA on Ca2+ activation probably reflects phosphorylation of thin-filament regulatory proteins by protein kinase C.\r"

  ".U": "90374481\r", 
  ".W": "Studies conducted in our laboratory have demonstrated that activated immune cells produce a soluble inhibitor(s) of cardiac myocyte contractile and cyclic AMP (cAMP) responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation. To examine the mechanism of this effect, metabolic assays were conducted on cultured rat cardiac myocytes incubated in the presence and absence of supernatants harvested from rat activated splenocyte cultures. Intracellular cAMP accumulation in response to isoproterenol was inhibited by up to 74% in a dose-dependent fashion by conditioned media containing soluble cytokines from activated immune cells. By use of myocyte cultures in which contaminating nonmyocyte proliferation was inhibited by nonlethal irradiation, this phenomenon was shown to be independent of mitogenic effects. Isobutylmethylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, did not ablate cytokine-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation. Parameters of beta-adrenergic receptor binding and affinity were also unaffected. cAMP suppression was maintained after cholera toxin stimulation of cAMP production via stimulatory G protein ADP-ribosylation. cAMP inhibition was not apparent when cells were stimulated with forskolin, a direct adenylate cyclase activator. Importantly, pertussis toxin treatment significantly ablated cytokine-induced cAMP inhibition. Thus, interference with agonist-occupied beta-adrenergic receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP and subsequent contractile responses is induced by a factor(s) elaborated by activated immune cells. This interference occurs at the level of signal transduction across the membrane, can be overridden by pertussis toxin, and may involve changes in the coupling of the stimulatory/inhibitory G proteins to adenylate cyclase. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism of cytokine-induced myocyte dysfunction and may have important pathophysiological ramifications in immune-mediated myocardial diseases.\r"

Low- and high-resolution autoradiography was performed using 125I-endothelin 1 on intact rat myocardium and samples of human ventricle obtained from explanted hearts at the time of transplant. In addition to specific binding to the smooth muscle of the blood vessel lumen, there was considerable binding associated with cardiac myocytes. To discover whether there was any functional correlate for this binding, muscle cells were isolated enzymatically from human and rat ventricle and from rat femoral artery, and their contractile characteristics were studied. Single cardiac cells were superfused with physiological saline at 32 degrees C, and their length change was displayed continuously on a chart recorder. Endothelin 1 had a pronounced effect on shortening in both rat and human myocytes. The contraction amplitude was approximately doubled in both cases, from 4.1 +/- 0.8% cell length to 8.1 +/- 1.3% for rat (mean +/- SEM, n = 9, p less than 0.001), and from 2.1 +/- 0.5% to 4.0 +/- 0.5% in human (n = 10, p less than 0.001). In rat, the magnitude of the effect was comparable to that of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine.

The deficiencies in the screening of semen donors especially for sexually-transmitted diseases has been discussed and importance of a rational protocol for recruitment and screening of potential donors has been emphasized. Factors influencing the success and outcome of donor insemination have been reviewed with particular emphasis on providing prognostic guidelines to potential donor insemination couples as to the success and outcome of the treatment. The importance of accurate timing of inseminations in determining the success of donor insemination has also been discussed. However, as has been highlighted throughout this review, there is a lack of specific prospective controlled trials, which are clearly necessary to answer specific important questions. Also emphasized has been the need of these trials to answer such basic questions as the influence of accurate timing on conception rates in specific groups of insemination recipients.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-six cases of unruptured tubal pregnancy were treated by laparoscope-guided injection of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha into the affected tube and the ovary containing the corpus luteum. Preoperative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels were 22 to 2,050 IU/L (mean 328 IU/L). The procedure was successful in 24 patients (92%), as indicated by reduction of hCG values to less than 20 IU/L. The remaining 2 cases showed an initial fall in hCG after injection and thereafter a plateau phase indicating the persistence of trophoblast. In both cases, a second surgical intervention was necessary. The total subsequent conception rate among 19 women desiring pregnancy was 90% (17/19). The intrauterine conception rate was 58% (11/19), and the repeat rate of ectopic pregnancy was 32% (6/19). Two-thirds (12/19) of the subsequent pregnancies occurred within 6 months \"at risk\" for conception. It is concluded that local injection of PGF2 alpha represents an attractive method for termination of selected cases of tubal pregnancy, preferentially in subjects with low trophoblastic activity.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate ovarian steroidogenesis, and hyperinsulinemia is often accompanied by hyperandrogenemia in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). Because opioid peptides are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, we studied the effect of naloxone-induced opiate receptor blockade on the circulating levels of insulin, IGF-I, and IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) in 13 nonobese and 7 obese PCOD patients and in 6 healthy subjects. In obese PCOD patients, the mean basal insulin concentration was significantly higher and the IGFBP-1 concentration lower than in nonobese PCOD patients. Plasma IGF-I levels were elevated both in obese and nonobese PCOD patients. After an intravenous bolus of 10 mg naloxone, no significant changes were found in the circulating insulin or IGF-I levels, whereas IGFBP-1 levels decreased in nonobese PCOD patients and remained low in obese PCOD patients. No significant decrease was found in healthy subjects. These results suggest that, in addition to insulin, endogenous opioids are involved in the regulation of serum IGFBP-1 level.\r"

A score of 0, 1, or 2 was assigned for absent, mild, or strong movements. An average score of 1.5 was obtained at midcycle in spontaneously ovulating women, which was significantly different from early or late follicular (0.36 and 0.5) or luteal (0.4) phase scores. Significant differences were found among the three groups: IVF patients averaged more movements than natural cycle patients, who in turn had a higher incidence than patients taking OCs. Increased peristaltic endometrial movements appear to occur in women around midcycle, probably as an enhancing mechanism for sperm propulsion towards the tubal ostia.\r"

The study involved 60 patients who underwent a total of 264 therapeutic donor insemination cycles using cryopreserved semen specimens. Patients alternated LH-kit timed cycles with cycles timed by non-LH methods for a total of 6 cycles or until pregnancy was achieved. Fecundability rates were 12.3% for LH-kit cycles and 5.3% for non-LH method cycles. The difference in outcome was not statistically significant. However, when the LH kit plus 1 insemination was compared with 2 inseminations timed by conventional methods, there appeared to be a distinct monetary and time expenditure advantage. These findings suggest that sufficient advantage may be derived from use of an LH kit to recommend its use on a routine basis for the timing of therapeutic donor insemination.\r"

While none of these conditions is a direct threat to the physical well being of the patient, their psychological impact, particularly with regard to self-perception, can be significant and even profound. They therefore merit a response from physicians caring for such patients.\r"

The remaining seven patients had a satisfactory clinical outcome. However, an improved acetabular bone structure, as judged by radiographic evidence of incorporation of the bone grafts, was maintained in only four patients. In our experience, acetabular reconstruction with morseled bone grafts and a bipolar prosthesis was associated with a high rate of failure, and we do not recommend that it be performed routinely. It should be considered only as a salvage procedure in elderly or infirm patients, as a possible alternative to more extensive procedures.\r"

Twenty-six subjects were recruited from patients enrolled in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treatment protocols in the early stages of the disease. Body weight, percent body fat, serum albumin, total protein concentration, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and total lymphocyte count were monitored monthly. Four-day food intake records were kept every 4 months. In the 19 patients followed for 16 months (Group 1), a significant (p less than .05) decrease was observed in body weight, percent body fat, body mass index (BMI), and total protein concentration. Seven subjects (Group 2), with more advanced disease than Group 1, demonstrated a significant (p less than .05) decrease in total lymphocyte count over a 5-month period. This latter group fell just below the normal range for hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations during the study period. With the exception of a decrease in vitamin B-6, zinc, and total energy intake, food records closely matched the Recommended Dietary Allowance for the age group. Thus, we conclude that decreases in body weight, percent body fat, and BMI may be the earliest indication of decreased nutritional status in HIV-infected patients.\r"

Changes in specific nutrient status and metabolism can also develop; heroin addiction can cause hyperkalemia and morphine use can result in calcium inhibition. Nutrition-related physiological aspects, such as impaired gastrin release, hypercholesterolemia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia, are also seen with morphine use. Nutrition-related conditions can affect sensitivity to and dependence on drugs and their effects. Diabetes decreases sensitivity to and dependence on morphine, protein deprivation produces preferential fat utilization with low cocaine use, and vitamin D deficiency decelerates morphine dependency. During use and/or withdrawal from nicotine, heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, major changes in food selection and intake occur, which result in weight gain or loss. Detailed human studies are needed to investigate the effects of drug use on the broad spectrum of nutrients and to determine the role of nutrition during drug withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients developed adrenal hemorrhage during treatment with intravenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This complication presented suddenly with upper abdominal and flank pain mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. In each patient the symptoms of the underlying bowel disease had subsided under the ACTH therapy. In our first patient the diagnosis was not made until laparotomy, but in the subsequent three patients the diagnosis was suspected by the strikingly similar clinical presentation. In each of these three latter patients the diagnosis was confirmed by sonography or computed tomography (CT) scan, and surgery was avoided. All four of our patients are doing well at 1-58 months of follow-up. Signs of adrenal insufficiency occurred only in the one of our four patients, and in those six of 11 previously reported patients, who had bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. ACTH-induced adrenal hemorrhage requires stopping ACTH and maintaining corticosteroid support. The diagnosis of adrenal hemorrhage should be considered in the patient treated with ACTH who develops unexplained acute abdominal or flank pain. Failure to recognize this complication of ACTH therapy can lead to unnecessary surgery or the dangerous continuation of the offending agent.\r"

Sixty-three patients were randomized to receive Golytely; 17 were inpatients, 33 were outpatients, and colonoscopy was canceled in 13. Sixty-one patients were randomized to receive the enema preparation; 17 were inpatients, 30 were outpatients, and colonoscopy was canceled in 14. For adequacy of the preparation, no differences were statistically significant, but the enema preparation was superior in outpatients while Golytely was superior in inpatients. Patients tolerated the enema preparation better, a finding present in both outpatients and inpatients. Contrary to previous reports of a significant advantage with Golytely, patients greater than or equal to 75 years old did not enjoy this advantage, but seemed to tolerate enemas better than Golytely with little difference in adequacy of the preparation.\r"

The relatively high endogenous antimicrobial (opsonic) activity of the ascitic fluid in this setting appears to protect the patient from infection. We report two patients with high-protein, noncirrhotic ascites complicated by spontaneous peritonitis due to Salmonella species. One patient had ascites due to heart failure, whereas the other patient's ascites was due to peritoneal carcinomatosis. The ascitic fluid total protein concentrations were 3.1 and 3.3 g/dl, respectively, and the opsonic activity of the ascitic fluid specimens were 2.03 and 2.00 log kill, respectively, indicating a high degree of bacterial killing. We hypothesize that the virulence of the Salmonella species was able to overcome the high opsonic activity in the ascitic fluid, resulting in infection in these two patients. Fever, abdominal pain, or encephalopathy in a patient with high-protein ascites may suggest the presence of an unusual organism causing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\r"

Two were cirrhotic, one due to alcohol and the other due to hepatitis B. The other two patients had chronic active hepatitis with regenerative nodules but only limited fibrosis, one due to hepatitis B, the other probable non-A, non-B. None had any evidence of hepatic malignancy. We conclude that some patients with chronic hepatitis may present with a pseudotumor appearance on radiological scans, due to the presence of regenerative nodules. Space-occupying lesions on liver scans in chronic hepatitis may represent non-neoplastic liver disease.\r"

We describe three cases and review the best documented reports in the literature. Review of 25 patients shows that in most cases, excluding lymphoma, the liver is massively replaced by tumor that often spreads in an intrasinusoidal pattern. The diffuse nature of malignant spread results in a relative failure of diagnostic imaging and thus the diagnosis is frequently made after death, which occurs a mean 7.8 days after hospital admission. Review of the clinical features and investigations in these cases shows that, when hepatomegaly and ascites are present in middle-aged or older patients at the time of admission, malignancy should be considered as the cause. Why the liver should be massively replaced in such patients remains obscure.\r"

After T cell and macrophage depletion of thymic single cell suspensions, B cell-enriched populations were isolated. Enriched B cells expressed at variable levels activation markers such as CD71, 4F2, CD23, and B8.7, indicating that a marked proportion of them are activated. Moreover, addition of B cell growth factor 12kDa and to a lesser extent of rIL-2 induced a spontaneous proliferation of these B cell populations. These functional and phenotypic signs of activation may reveal the first steps of an autoimmune response against acetylcholine receptor as enriched B cell populations have the capacity to spontaneously secrete anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody.\r"

Spleen cells from mice inoculated with SL3261-gp63 developed antibody and proliferative T cell response to L. major. They did not express detectable delayed-type hypersensitivity reactivity. The activated T cells are mainly CD4+ and secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma but no IL-4. The orally immunized mice developed significant resistance against a challenge L. major infection.

  ".W": "The mouse uterus during pregnancy contains a large population of lymphoid cells termed granulated metrial gland (GMG) cells. Our observations suggest that these cells are highly activated cytolytic lymphocytes related to NK or lymphokine-activated killer cells. Immunostaining demonstrated asialo GM1 and Thy-1 on GMG cells, both of which are expressed by NK cells. Decidua basalis tissue and isolated GMG cells contained three proteins that are characteristic of activated cytolytic lymphocyte granules: perforin, serine esterase 1, and serine esterase 2. These mediators were demonstrated in GMG cells by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antisera and by Northern blot analysis using specific cDNA probes for their mRNA. The proteins were not detected in normal spleen or liver or in asialo GM1+ cells isolated from those organs, consistent with the absence of these mediators from resting cytolytic cells. The amount of perforin in GMG cells was similar to that present in cloned, IL-2-stimulated, CTL shown previously to contain a large amount of this protein. A large population of NK cells bearing the surface marker LGL-1 was demonstrated at the implantation site by labeling with monoclonal antibody 4D11, but T cells were not detected. Many LGL-1+ cells at the implantation site expressed the GMG cell markers asialo GM1, Thy-1, and perforin. Staining intensities were inversely correlated, with LGL-1-bright cells showing little or no staining of GMG cell markers and LGL-1-faint cells showing more obvious staining of GMG cell markers. This suggests that LGL-1+ NK cells may differentiate in situ to GMG cells, losing LGL-1 and gaining a high concentration of GMG cell markers in the process. Activated cytolytic cells related to NK or lymphokine-activated killer cells may function in the pregnant rodent uterus to intercept and kill aberrant placental or embryonic cells that might otherwise enter the female and proliferate.\r"

  ".W": "Radiation therapy plays an integral part in managing intracranial tumors. While the risk:benefit ratio is considered acceptable for treating malignant tumors, risks of long-term complications of radiotherapy need thorough assessment in adults treated for benign tumors. Many previously reported delayed complications of radiotherapy can be attributed to inappropriate treatment or to the sensitivity of a developing child's brain to radiation. Medical records, radiological studies, autopsy findings, and follow-up information were reviewed for 58 adult patients (31 men and 27 women) treated between 1958 and 1987 with radiotherapy for benign intracranial tumors. Patient ages at the time of irradiation ranged from 21 to 87 years (mean 47.7 years). The pathology included 46 pituitary adenomas, five meningiomas, four glomus jugulare tumors, two pineal area tumors, and one craniopharyngioma. Average radiation dosage was 4984 cGy (range 3100 to 7012 cGy), given in an average of 27.2 fractions (range 15 to 45 fractions), over a period averaging 46.6 days. The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 31 years (mean 8.1 years). Findings related to tumor recurrence or surgery were excluded. Twenty-two patients had complications considered to be delayed side effects of radiotherapy. Two patients had visual deterioration developing 3 and 6 years after treatment; six had pituitary dysfunction; and 17 had varying degrees of parenchymal changes of the brain, occurring mostly in the temporal lobes and relating to the frequent presentation of pituitary tumors (two of these also had pituitary dysfunction). One clival tumor with the radiographic appearance of a meningioma, developed 30 years post-irradiation for acromegaly. This study unveils considerable delayed sequelae of radiotherapy in a series of adult patients receiving what is considered \"safe\" treatment for benign brain tumors.\r"

At surgery, the Stereoadapter was remounted to the head and the stereotactic CT coordinates were transferred to the Stereoguide without radiography. Air ventriculography was then carried out. The positions of the anterior and posterior commissures (AC and PC), the length of the intercommissural (IC) line, the width of the third ventricle, and the stereotactic coordinates of the target were measured on the ventriculograms and compared to the stereotactic CT measurements. The study showed that the width of the third ventricle was significantly larger on the ventriculograms than on the stereotactic CT scans, whereas the length of the IC line was not significantly different. The differences in the coordinates of the target and of the AC and PC were statistically significant only for the anteroposterior (y) coordinate. Both commissures as well as the surgical target lay, on average, 1.0 mm more anteriorly on the ventriculograms than on the stereotactic CT study. It is concluded that air ventriculography may cause slight anterior displacement of the midbrain structures. The surgical coordinates of the targets based on the stereotactic CT study with the Stereoadapter were on average as accurate as those obtained with ventriculography; therefore, ventriculography may become superfluous in functional stereotaxis.\r"

In anatomically normal brains this is a valid assumption; however, in some patients with distorted vascular anatomy (as in hydrocephalus) a small insonation angle cannot be assumed, and measurements of flow velocity may be misleadingly low. The orientation of the middle cerebral arteries was studied on magnetic resonance images of 17 control patients and three patients with hydrocephalus, and estimates of insonation angle errors in velocity measurements were made. When asymmetrical vessel distortion is present, relative flow to each hemisphere may not be accurately reflected in the measured velocities. Under these circumstances, the resistivity index may be a more reliable hemodynamic parameter.\r"

It has been suggested that the beneficial metabolic effects of dietary fiber may be mediated through propionate. We therefore compared the effects of a soluble dietary fiber concentrate, konjac-glucomannan (K-GM), and of propionate on plasma fibrinogen, serum and liver lipid, glucose tolerance, insulin response and liver glycogen in baboons. Twelve male baboons were fed a \"Western\" diet with or without K-GM (5%) or sodium propionate (2%) supplements for periods of 9 wk in a crossover, randomized order, with stabilization periods in between. Measurements were taken at baseline and after 4 and 9 wk of each study period. After 9 wk, total serum cholesterol levels were significantly higher than pretest values when baboons consumed the unsupplemented Western diet (25%, p less than 0.05) or the propionate diet (17%, p less than 0.05). Konjac-glucomannan prevented this increase. The high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increased with all experimental diets (p less than 0.05). The percentage of total cholesterol as high density lipoprotein cholesterol, was significantly higher with K-GM supplementation than with the other diets. Konjac-glucomannan supplementation also resulted in lower than baseline values for triglycerides (p less than 0.01) and circulating free fatty acids (p less than 0.05) after 9 wk. Only the propionate diet raised serum triglycerides significantly (by 6%) above baseline. Liver cholesterol concentration was 31-34% lower, and the area under the glucose tolerance curve was smaller with K-GM and propionate diets (p less than 0.05) than with the unsupplemented diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Offspring from Mn-sufficient female rats fed 45 micrograms Mn/g diet (control) and from Mn-deficient (Mn-) female rats fed 1 microgram Mn/g diet were used in these studies. Both basal and insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport in isolated adipose cells was significantly lower in Mn- rats, averaging 40% and 50% of control values, respectively. Kinetic analysis of glucose transport demonstrated a lower maximal transport velocity (Vmax) for glucose in adipose cells from Mn- rats compared to controls. No differences in the Km for glucose uptake were observed between the two groups. Insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation to CO2 and conversion to triglycerides was lower in isolated adipose cells from Mn- rats compared to controls. Mn- animals had fewer insulin receptors per cell compared to controls, although no differences in insulin receptor affinity were observed between the two groups. These data suggest that Mn deficiency affects glucose transport and metabolism in the adipose cell. The apparent defect lies distal to the insulin receptor and probably reflects a decreased number of glucose transporters in adipose tissue of Mn- rats.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of insulin on the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in isolated adipocytes from rats in various nutritional states was studied. Because LPL is secreted from adipocytes, possible insulin effects on LPL activity were assessed as 1) total cellular LPL activity, 2) LPL activity spontaneously secreted during incubations and 3) LPL secretion during perifusion of adipocytes preincubated with or without insulin. Incubation with insulin for 2 h produced no increase in LPL activity associated with adipocytes isolated from 5- to 6-wk-old fasted rats but increased by 83% the activity of LPL secreted into the incubation medium. Insulin pretreatment increased by 230% the capacity of the cells to secrete LPL activity when perifused in the presence of 5% fasted human serum. In adipocytes from young rats killed in the fed state, preincubation with insulin caused a small increase in cell-associated LPL activity (+21%) but no increase in LPL activity spontaneously secreted into the incubation medium. Similar to results in fasted rats, insulin-pretreated cells showed a 101% increase in their ability to secrete LPL activity during a perifusion. In contrast, larger adipocytes from 3-mo-old rats were totally unresponsive to insulin effects on both cellular and secreted LPL. However, 3 d of fasting followed by 9 d of refeeding restored responsiveness to insulin effects on both cellular and secreted LPL activity. Thus, variations in cellular responsiveness to insulin effects on LPL activity may play an important role in regulating nutrition-induced changes in LPL activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present experiments, the effect of DHEA treatment in rats with diet-induced obesity was evaluated. In experiment 1, male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) were fed a nonpurified diet (reference group) or a condensed milk-corn oil nonpurified diet [diet-induced obese (DIO) rats] for 7 wk. Then, 0.6% DHEA was included in the food of one-half of the DIO rats (DIO + DHEA rats). After 6 wk, DIO rats weighed 23% more and had greater fat pad weights, cell size and cell number than reference and DIO + DHEA rats. Brown fat mitochondrial respiration was similar in all groups. DIO rats had higher serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations than reference and DIO + DHEA rats. DIO + DHEA rats had lower serum insulin levels than DIO and reference rats. In experiment 2, male Sprague-Dawley rats (460 g) were fed either the nonpurified diet or the condensed milk diet for 8 wk. Condensed milk-fed rats were then divided into DIO and diet-resistant groups. One-half of the rats in each group were fed 0.6% DHEA for 2 wk. Body weights and serum glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol and triiodothyronine levels were lowered by DHEA treatment in all groups. Liver mitochondrial state 3 respiration rates per gram and per liver and peroxisomal beta-oxidation were higher in DHEA-treated than in control rats. In DIO rats, DHEA treatment appears to interfere with hyperplastic adipose tissue growth. In this strain of rats, DHEA appears to have hypolipidemic and hypoinsulinemic effects.\r"

A case of severe warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with reticulocytopenia in a patient with AIDS-related complex is reported. Laboratory and clinical findings of severe hemolysis were present, including anhaptoglobinemia, microspherocytosis, splenomegaly, and transfusion dependence. Azidothymidine (AZT) therapy may have exacerbated this patient's anemia. Splenectomy produced a delayed but complete remission of the AIHA despite continuation of AZT therapy. Review of other reports of positive direct antiglobulin tests and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patients with HIV infections suggests that autoantibodies may be a significant cause of anemia in this population and that the frequent lack of reticulocytosis, despite bone marrow erythroid hyperplasia, may lead to the underdiagnosis of AIHA in HIV-infected patients.\r"

By Western blotting, serum antibodies to envelope antigens were demonstrated in one of three individuals who received the low dose vaccine and two of two who received the high dose. Antibodies to gp160 were detected in whole saliva on day 194 from one of these individuals by Western blotting. Parotid saliva collected on all dates did not contain detectable HIV-specific antibodies. The finding of HIV-1-specific antibodies in whole saliva following vaccination may indicate that development of mucosal immunity is possible.\r"

The success of the procedure is reliant partly on the ability of the urologist to remove the adrenal gland safely and atraumatically with minimal morbidity. We describe our technique using a posterior 12th rib approach, which is extrapleural and extraperitoneal. In the initial 10 patients there was no significant morbidity from the operation and all patients were discharged from the hospital within 3 to 7 days postoperatively. The importance of using a no touch technique in mobilizing the gland is emphasized, since any hemorrhage within the adrenal medulla may make it impossible to recover the tissue for stereotactic implantation. Hemorrhage occurred in 1 of our patients, who was elderly and obese. The technique described allows for adequate exposure while maintaining acceptably low morbidity from the procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder disorder of unknown etiology that primarily afflicts women and is characterized by urgency and pain. Although immune mechanisms have been implicated in the disease process, little is known about the local or peripheral blood immune responses. Cryostat sections of snap-frozen bladder biopsies obtained by transurethral resection from 43 patients (24 with classical and 9 with nonulcerative or early interstitial cystitis, and 10 controls) were analyzed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies with an avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique to characterize the local immune response of bladder mucosa. Simultaneously obtained heparinized peripheral blood (10 cc) was analyzed by flow cytometry in 24 patients (9 with classical and 5 with nonulcerative early interstitial cystitis, and 10 controls) using the same panel of antibodies. The control group biopsies (median age 44 years, range 27 to 52 years) had no ulcers, few lymphoid cells (predominately T-helper cells), rare T cell nodules and no B cells. The nonulcer group (median age 39 years, range 29 to 44 years) had rare mucosal ruptures but no ulcers, slightly increased lymphoid cells (predominately T-helper), occasional T cell aggregates, no B cell nodules and rare plasma cells. No statistically significant difference between control and nonulcerative interstitial cystitis patients was identified. In contrast, the classical interstitial cystitis group (median age 68 years, range 47 to 73 years) had ulcers, intense inflammation with focal sheets of plasma cells, aggregates of T cells, B cell nodules including germinal centers, a decreased or normal helper-to-suppressor cell ratio and suppressor cytotoxic cells in germinal centers. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets showed normal patterns in controls, increased numbers of secretory Ig positive B cells and activated lymphocytes in the nonulcerative group, and increased numbers of secretory Ig positive B cells with mildly abnormal kappa-to-lambda ratios and activated lymphocytes in the classical group. We conclude that an immune mechanism has at least a partial role in the pathophysiology of interstitial cystitis. A parallel between interstitial cystitis and inflammatory bowel disease is evident. Further studies are indicated.\r"

Normal mucosa had a mean value of 0.37 +/- 0.35% cells positive for Ki-67, whereas 9 histological grade 1 tumors showed 2.2 +/- 1.5%, 31 grade 2 tumors averaged 10.1 +/- 7.5% and 15 grade 3 tumors yielded 19.5 +/- 9.0%. These values were significantly different from each other (p less than 0.01), with Ki-67 indexes for grade 2 varying from 0.3 to 24.6%. Nonpapillary tumors had significantly higher indexes than papillary tumors (20.1 +/- 8.0 versus 6.7 +/- 5.9, p less than 0.01). The Ki-67 indexes were 4.6 +/- 4.5% for stage Ta (20 cases), 7.8 +/- 4.7% for stage T1 (14) and 20.2 +/- 7.8% for stages equal to or higher than T2 (21). Significant differences were noted between stages Ta and T1 (p less than 0.05) and between stages T1 and T2 or greater (p less than 0.01). Tumors with muscle layer invasion often showed more than 15% Ki-67 positive cells. Our results imply that Ki-67 indexes not only provide objective information to determine a malignant potential but also help to select the treatment.\r"

The mean arterial diameter change was 72% associated with average blood flow velocity and acceleration changes of approximately 200%. Actual values for blood flow velocity and acceleration were considerably higher when compared to papaverine-induced values measured in psychogenically impotent men. Visual sexually stimulated penile arterial changes are not analogous to papaverine-induced arterial changes and these differences raise questions about the appropriateness of using psychogenically impotent men as controls for measurement of penile arterial function with duplex scanning.\r"

After 2 weeks on placebo the patients were assigned at random to 4 groups: group P--placebo, group L--0.1 mg., group M--0.2 mg. and group H--0.4 mg. of YM617. Comparing the placebo to the treatment period, subjective symptoms, such as nocturia and urgency, were significantly decreased in group H (p less than 0.01). The sensation of incomplete voiding was significantly improved in groups M and H (p less than 0.01). However, the differences among the groups were statistically insignificant. Residual urine volume was significantly decreased in groups L, M and H after instillation of saline into the bladder (p less than 0.01) but not in group P. The maximum and average flow rates were significantly increased in groups L, M and H (p less than 0.01) but not in group P. Average flow rate showed significant differences between groups M or H versus group P. Neither orthostatic hypotension nor a decrease in blood pressure was noted. Adverse side effects and changes in laboratory data were all slight and disappeared when the second tests were performed. In summary, the irritative and obstructive symptoms caused by benign prostatic hypertrophy were decreased and urodynamic studies were markedly improved by the alpha 1-blocker, YM617. The drug seems to be useful in the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy.\r"

Currently, pathological stage and histological appearance are used to predict prognosis. We tested a new approach. Histological sections of surgical specimens were obtained from 9 children treated for unilateral Wilms tumor. All patients had favorable histological disease, and received postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These specimens were evaluated by nuclear morphometry with the Hopkins Morphometry System to determine if nuclear shape descriptors could distinguish children who responded to therapy from those whose tumor recurred. Nuclear roundness, ellipticity, convexity and bending energy accurately separated the groups. Nuclear morphometry may provide useful information that will aid in predicting which children with Wilms tumor will respond to therapy and warrants further investigations.\r"

  ".W": "With the exception of conventional angiography, no previously proposed screening test has the necessary sensitivity/specificity to guide further evaluation for correctable renovascular disease. Recently, renal duplex sonography has been suggested as a useful substitute in such screening for renovascular disease. This report analyzes our data collected over the past 10 months in evaluation of renal duplex sonography to examine its diagnostic value. The study population for renal duplex sonography validity analysis consisted of 74 consecutive patients who had 77 comparative renal duplex sonography and standard angiographic studies of the arterial anatomy to 148 kidneys. Renal duplex sonography results from six kidneys (4%) were considered inadequate for interpretation. This study population contained 26 patients (35%) with severe renal insufficiency (mean 3.6 mg/dl) and 67 hypertension (91%). Fourteen patients (19%) had 20 kidneys with multiple renal arteries. Bilateral disease was present in 22 of the 44 patients with significant renovascular disease. Renal duplex sonography correctly identified the presence of renovascular disease in 41 of 44 patients with angiographically proven lesions, and renovascular disease was not identified in any patient free of disease. When single renal arteries were present (122 kidneys), renal duplex sonography provided 93% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 98% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, and an overall accuracy of 96%. These results were adversely affected when kidneys with multiple (polar) renal arteries were examined. Although the end diastolic ratio was inversely correlated with serum creatinine (r = -0.3073, p = 0.009), low end diastolic ratio in 35 patients submitted to renovascular reconstruction did not preclude beneficial blood pressure or renal function response. We conclude from this analysis that renal duplex sonography can be a valuable screening test in the search for correctable renovascular disease causing global renal ischemia and secondary renal insufficiency (ischemic nephropathy). Renal duplex sonography does not, however, exclude polar vessel renovascular disease causing hypertension alone nor does it predict hypertension or renal function response after correction of renovascular disease.\r"

The remaining eight grafts with suspected stenoses were followed without angiography, and four (50%) subsequently failed. Only two (3.3%) of 61 grafts with normal scan outcomes have thrombosed. Fistulas were identified in 12 (37%) of 32 in situ grafts evaluated. Nine grafts with previously suspected problems based on decreased ankle-brachial indexes were scanned, and an explanation was found, confirmed by angiogram, and corrected in six. Detection of unsuspected stenoses in five grafts requiring revision and four grafts that later thrombosed without revision, as well as identification of fistulas in 37% of in situ grafts, confirms the importance of color-flow imaging as a screening tool.\r"

  ".W": "Dilation is the most common inherent \"failure mode\" of knitted Dacron aortic prostheses. However, the incidence of graft failure related to dilation is unknown because of insufficient data regarding the occurrence, degree, and prognostic significance of postoperative alterations in graft size. In 1979 we reported that postoperative ultrasonic examinations in 95 asymptomatic patients, selected at random after aortic surgery, revealed dilation of the aortic portion of knitted Dacron bifurcation grafts. The average follow-up was 33 months, and the mean dilation was 18%. This article provides the results of a later follow-up, averaging 175 months, in 32 patients from the 1979 study. CT scanning, rather than ultrasonic imaging, was used to evaluate all parts of the grafts. CT scans disclosed that the three parts of each graft dilated, but the parts did not always dilate uniformly. Mean percent dilation values for the entire series were aortic portion 67% +/- 38% SD; right limb 77% +/- 66% SD; left limb 54% +/- 26% SD. Maximum percent dilation for any part of the grafts ranged from 26% to 367% with a mean of 94%. At least one part of the grafts dilated 100% or greater in 12 patients. Three patients had generalized and saccular dilation of the aortic portion of the prostheses and an anastomotic aortic aneurysm; one patient had a localized aneurysm in the midportion of the right limb. Three of the latter grafts were replaced with woven Dacron prostheses.\r"

  ".U": "90376567\r", 
  ".W": "Routine follow-up of patients after carotid endarterectomy with duplex scanning is commonly practiced, yet the clinical significance of identifying those with asymptomatic restenosis is unclear. To address this issue we reviewed 120 consecutive patients who underwent 143 carotid endarterectomies from August 1983 to December 1988. One hundred one patients (118 operations) were available for clinical follow-up, and the overall incidence of recurrent symptoms was 6% (6/101). Sixty-three of these patients (78 carotid endarterectomies) had postoperative duplex examination. Two had evidence of residual disease from the time of surgery and were not included in further analysis. Significant recurrent stenosis (greater than 50% diameter reduction) developed in 14 of the remaining 76 arteries (18.2%). Twelve of 14 stenoses remained asymptomatic during follow-up from 18 to 72 months (mean 47.0 months) and did not undergo reoperation. Recurrent ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms developed in two patients with restenosis (14.3%). Four of the 62 arteries without significant recurrent stenosis developed ipsilateral symptoms (6.5%), but none required reoperation during follow-up from 1 to 71 months (mean 31.6 months). Life-table analysis showed no increased risk of transient ischemic attack, stroke, or death in patients with restenosis. This study supports regular clinical follow-up after carotid endarterectomy with emphasis on patient education in the recognition of symptoms. Although duplex scanning may be useful to follow known contralateral asymptomatic disease or evaluate those with recurrent symptoms, its routine use to identify patients with asymptomatic restenosis after carotid endarterectomy may be unnecessary.\r"

Sensitivity analyses incorporated uncertainties about HIV infection and test performance. Current screening strategies are estimated to allow 20.5 infected units per million donated units to be transfused at a cost of $16,850 per HIV-positive unit detected in high-prevalence areas and 4.7 infected units per million donated units to be transfused at a cost of $32,275 per HIV-positive unit detected in low prevalence areas, with nine false-positive notifications of uninfected patients per million units screened and 14.9 discarded, noninfected units per HIV-positive unit in low-prevalence areas. Testing donated blood for HIV can be improved by individualizing screening strategies for areas with different prevalences of HIV. Efforts to further reduce transfusion-associated HIV should focus on improved test performance in early stages of infection, reduction of unnecessary transfusions, donor recruitment in lower-risk groups, and public health measures to reduce HIV infection among the general population.\r"

Annual follow-up questionnaires requested information on the occurrence of numerous medical conditions including migraine. At the end of 60 months, morbidity follow-up was 99.7% complete, and the reported consumption of aspirin or other platelet-active drugs was 86% in the aspirin group and 14% in the placebo group. Of those randomized to aspirin, 661 (6.0%) reported migraine at some time after randomization, as compared with 818 (7.4%) of those allocated to the placebo group, representing a statistically significant 20% reduction in recurrence rate. The rate of self-report of ordinary headache was similar in the two groups. These data indicate that migraine is mediated, at least in part, by the effects of platelets and suggest that low-dose aspirin should be considered for prophylaxis among those with a history of established migraine.\r"

The RNA from the 32 diabetic patients did not react with nucleic acid probes for mumps, rubella, or coxsackie B viruses. In-situ nucleic acid hybridisation on tissues from 5 randomly selected human-CMV-positive patients showed that the human CMV signal was localised primarily in the islets of Langerhans and not in exocrine cells. Despite the clear viral nucleic acid signal in tissues of human-CMV-positive patients, there were no morphological injuries to the islets, no inflammatory cells in the islets, and no perivascular inflammatory cell cuffing. These findings suggest a possible association of human CMV with type 2 diabetes in human beings.\r"

Aerosols were inhaled from a spacer with a facemask. Budesonide significantly improved symptom scores of wheezing, sleep disturbance, and patient happiness. The frequency of severe exacerbations that required a course of oral prednisolone was also significantly reduced. The treatment effect appeared to be fully established after 6-8 weeks and no side-effects could be ascribed to the active treatment. The findings indicate that young children below 3 years of age can inhale a pressurised aerosol from a spacer with a facemask. Use of topically active glucocorticosteroids with this simple device may reduce symptoms and distress in young children with moderately severe recurrent wheeze and dyspnoea, and possibly reduce their requirement for oral steroids.\r"

There was a 10% probability of values of these variables being abnormal when cadmium excretion exceeded 2-4 micrograms/24 h. Excretion reached this threshold in 10% of non-smokers. There was also evidence that diabetic patients may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of cadmium on the renal proximal tubule.\r"

The commonest direct cause is probably repeated sporadic chromosome abnormalities, which occur consecutively merely by chance. Congenital and acquired anatomical defects of the uterine fundus and cervix, parental chromosomal rearrangements, gene mutations, antibodies to cardiolipin, and luteal phase defects each make a small contribution. Other causes, such as polycystic ovaries and immune rejection, may play some part but the evidence is not clear. Psychological stress, subclinical infections, thyroid disorders, and diabetes mellitus are probably not relevant. Reassurance and clear statements about prognosis are important and psychological support must be offered throughout investigation and subsequent pregnancy. Much more rigorous scientific studies from which clearer conclusions can be drawn are vital for better understanding of this important clinical problem.\r"

We tested the rotational effect of three different 16-bite running suture patterns on eight cadaver eyes, with the following results: (1) the torque pattern rotates the corneal graft counterclockwise by 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm at the wound or 11 degrees; (2) the antitorque pattern rotates the corneal graft clockwise by 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm at the wound or 11 degrees; (3) an intermediate \"no torque\" pattern, the bites of which form an isosceles triangle, produces no rotational effect. We recommend the use of a \"no torque\" pattern to minimize corneal graft rotation.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized, masked study was conducted to evaluate whether intraocular aspiration of sodium hyaluronate used in cataract surgery influenced postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP). Ninety-nine patients (105 eyes) underwent uncomplicated extracapsular extractions with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation using 1% sodium hyaluronate (AMVISC). In 53 eyes, sodium hyaluronate was aspirated from the anterior chamber prior to wound closure. Sodium hyaluronate was left in the anterior chamber of 52 eyes. The IOP of 33 of the patients was measured 4 hours after surgery. No significant difference was found between the pressure in the eyes from which the sodium hyaluronate had been aspirated and the pressure in those from which it had not. The IOP of all the patients was measured on the first postoperative day. The mean 24 hours after surgery was 23.4 mm Hg in the aspirated eyes and 23.1 mm Hg in the not-aspirated group. Thirteen eyes in the aspirated group and 14 in the not-aspirated group had pressures above 30 mm Hg during the first 24 hours after surgery. There were no significant differences in visual outcome, patient discomfort, corneal clarity, anterior chamber inflammation, or subsequent IOPs during 3 months postoperative examination. Aspiration of sodium hyaluronate at the end of cataract surgery does not appear to significantly reduce either the incidence or the degree of postoperative pressure elevations.\r"
