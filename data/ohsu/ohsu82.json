  ".W": "Shave excision is a useful technique for the treatment of superficial solar lesions. The most common of these is the solar keratosis, which can be a red or gray scaling lesion. This can at times be difficult to differentiate from the superficial basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma or their more infiltrating types. Shave excision gives the advantage of a histopathologic report. Lesions found to be infiltrating or in danger of recurrence can then be further excised. The cosmetic appearance of the healed shave excision site is generally quite good, although it can be paler than the surrounding skin. If this is likely to be a problem, the shave graft can be applied, as with deeper shave excisions. A thin shave graft also can be used to repigment pale scarred areas. A series of 1313 shave excised lesions is analyzed.\r"

A functionally stable osteosynthesis can be achieved in such fractures with a solitary lag screw. This technique meets the principles of rigid internal fixation and achieves maximum stability with a minimum of implant material. It obviates the need for maxillomandibular fixation, as well as the morbidity associated with the conventional methods of treatment. A review is presented of 50 patients who were treated by this method. The data show that the procedure is an effective and predictable modality of treatment with a low rate of morbidity.\r"

The average distance the nipple-areola complex was moved was 12 cm, with the longest being 22.5 cm. Fifty-seven percent had fibrocystic mastopathy on histologic analysis, and no malignancies were found, even in patients who had undergone a previous mastectomy for breast carcinoma. The most common complication (3.1 percent) was minor suture line necrosis along the infra-mammary crease. All healed without intervention. There was no necrosis or sensory loss to the nipple-areola complex in any patient, and cosmesis was excellent. The analysis also showed that the use of epinephrine, injected subcutaneously just prior to the operation, significantly decreased intraoperative blood loss (p less than 0.0005), regardless of the amount of tissue removed, and eliminated the need for transfusions.\r"

Three to four nonaxial vessels were consistently found to enter the proximal plexus from within 5 cm of the perineum. Preservation of these vessels permitted reliable elevation of a 9 X 20 cm fasciocutaneous flap without using the gracilis muscle as a vascular carrier. Fifteen flaps in 13 patients were used for vaginal replacement and coverage of vulvectomy, groin, and ischial defects. Depending on the magnitude of the defect, simultaneous and independent elevation of the gracilis muscle provided additional vascularized coverage as needed. Our experience indicates that the medial thigh fasciocutaneous flap is a durable, less bulky, and potentially sensate alternative to the gracilis musculocutaneous flap for vaginal and perineal reconstruction.\r"

Preoperative analysis indicates that a wide variation exists in lateral nasal wall anatomy and angulation. Surgically, the lateral nasal walls undergo limited medial movement, with tilt a significant component. Postoperatively, extensive remodeling can occur, and virtually all osteotomies are healed by osseous union at 6 months. Future application of CT scans in severely deviated noses may be justified.\r"

The abnormal attachment of the alar base is first released by an incision along the superior buccal sulcus and piriform margin. There is no intercartilaginous incision. Basically, we use the Brown-McDowell technique with the addition of an alar rim incision. Undermining of the ala between the two incisions is carefully and adequately done, splitting it into two layers. The first is a skin and the second, a chondrocutaneous (vestibular skin) layer, which is handled as a single unit, thus enhancing its vascularity. This second layer is a bipedicle flap with a broad medial pedicle and a narrow lateral pedicle at the alar base. When the alar base is rolled into its normal position, the chondrocutaneous unit hinging on its two pedicles counterrotates, correcting the subluxation of the ala, a major component of the cleft lip nasal deformity. We depend on the normal position of the alar base, the postoperative scar tissue, and the inherently thick nostril wall in the Oriental to keep the alar dome up. No transfixion sutures are used. Ten consecutive patients are shown 20 years after surgery. All had one operation only. None showed any disturbance of nasal growth.\r"

To further define the timing and type of treatment necessary in these complex disorders, we have retrospectively analyzed all patients operated on for this deformity during the past 12 years. One-hundred and sixty-four patients with craniosynostosis were analyzed and subgrouped into asymmetrical (predominantly unilateral) and symmetrical (bilateral) deformities, in addition to segregation by age and type of procedure performed. This was done recognizing that no deformity, like no normal human face, is truly symmetrical. Results of treatment were categorized on the basis of the need for additional surgery and varied from no refinements necessary (category I) to major reduplication of the initial procedure (category IV). Analysis of the data led us to conclude that excellent results can be expected in the asymmetrical deformities group treated in infancy by a unilateral approach. Similarly, for the mild symmetrical deformities, treatment at this time by bilateral orbital advancement gives satisfactory results in the majority of patients. By contrast, the more severe symmetrical groups treated in childhood have a high incidence of requiring secondary major reconstructions, and consideration should be given to delaying craniofacial surgery until age 7 or older, although earlier cranial surgery may be advisable.\r"

A review of 170 transcranial operations is presented with a focus on postoperative infection and its relationship to patient age, preoperative microbiology, pattern of operation, length of operation, and the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The overall postoperative infection rate was 6.5 percent, but the infection rate in adults (23.5 percent) was much higher than in children (2.2 percent). Higher infection rates were found in adults with craniofacial dysostoses undergoing lengthy frontofacial advancements which required tracheostomy airway management. The residual frontal extradural dead space following advancement in adults is a sanctuary to infecting organisms from the respiratory tract--especially Pseudomonas transferred from the tracheostomy site into the upper airway and intracranial dead space by ventilation forces. Operating times for patients who became infected were 2 1/2 hours longer than average operating times for transcranial operations. Preoperative microbiology of the craniofacial region was not a good predictor of subsequent infection. Recommendations include operative intervention at an early age, short preoperative hospital stay, antibiotic prophylaxis to include gram-negative cover, surgical measures to either fill or isolate the dead space, and strict tracheostomy care--preferably with the patient being barrier-nursed.\r"

The effects of von Langenbeck palatoplasty on sleep-related upper airway obstruction were usually minimal and clinically insignificant, whereas severe obstructive sleep apnea was present in all but one of the patients undergoing pharyngeal flap surgery at 2 to 3 days postoperatively. In most patients the upper airway obstruction was resolved at the 3-month postoperative sleep study. These data suggest that palatoplasty carries with it a very slight risk of upper airway obstruction, whereas pharyngeal flap surgery has as a very frequent concomitant the occurrence of severe obstructive sleep apnea in the immediate postoperative period.\r"

The superficial adipose layer is contained within organized, compact fascial septa. The deep adipose layer demonstrated regional variations with respect to its fascial framework, but was contained within a relatively loose, less organized, and more widely spaced fascial septa. We observed that the adipose layers are partitioned by a discrete subcutaneous fascia which fuses with the underlying muscle fascia at particular anatomic locations. The deep layer is thus contained by the subcutaneous fascia above and the muscle fascia below to form what we termed the deep adipose compartments. The deep adipose compartments contributed significantly to overall adipose thickness, are bilateral, and are found in the abdomen and paralumbar and gluteal-thigh regions.\r"

The advantages of this technique are reduced operating time, ease of injection into the reservoir, lack of pain for the patient, early detection of reservoir or filling tube junction leakage, and lack of complications associated with the reservoir. This procedure is not recommended on at least theoretical grounds for breast expansion, where a permanent implant is to be inserted.\r"

The repair process at the anastomotic site was very rapid both in arteries and veins. The endothelialization was complete at 2 weeks, but a marked atrophy of the media was noted in the arterial anastomoses. The same phenomenon was observed in the venous anastomosis, but to a much lesser degree. Thrombus formation was extremely rare, and the atrophy of the media did not seem to affect the patency rate. The experiment has confirmed that the Unilink method provides a very safe, fast, and simple way to perform microvascular anastomoses.\r"

The meatus is relocated with a distally based turnover flap or with a meatoplasty and glanuloplasty. The lateral fusion raphes, which bifurcate in hypospadias from the ventral raphe toward the dogears of the skin hood, are then opened and sutured longitudinally, as fusion should have occurred. The postoperative aspect is that of a normal prepuce. Postoperative swelling is almost nonexistent, the incisions being made in embryologic fusion raphes. Results have been especially pleasing from the aesthetic point of view. A \"functional\" mobile prepuce is obtained (Table I).\r"

The tumor was very invasive and was treated first by wide surgical excision and radical node dissection, and when the tumor recurred, amputation of the arm was done. The world literature was carefully reviewed and compared with this case. Owing to the already known failure of radiotherapy, and since chemotherapy was not successful in our patient, the authors advise early aggressive surgery, including block dissection of the regional nodes, and thereafter a careful follow-up.\r"

The signal-enhancement-to-noise ratio was significantly larger in the tumor than in the liver (2 alpha less than or equal to .05). In a moderately T1-weighted spin echo (SE) sequence (SE 400/30) (repetition time [TR] msec/echo time [TE] msec), the tumor was better defined 6 minutes after administration of Gd-DTPA. More strongly T1-weighted sequences--that is, SE 200/20 and inversion recovery 1,500/35/400 (TR msec/TE msec/inversion time, msec)--showed significantly worse contrast between tumor and liver (signal-difference-to-noise ratio [SD/N]) 10 and 15 minutes after administration (2 alpha less than or equal to .05). On the other hand, the low SD/N in the rapid MR imaging sequence was significantly improved (2 alpha less than or equal to .05).

Two of the three remaining patients initially had no surgery, but they had recrudescences of their symptoms that required surgical drainage within 8 months. One patient in whom surgical resection was deferred remained asymptomatic 10 months after percutaneous drainage. A retrospective review of 87 patients undergoing surgery for diverticulitis suggested that the percentage of two-stage surgical procedures has decreased in the last 5-10 years, but there remains a substantial number of patients who might benefit from percutaneous catheter drainage of diverticular abscess of the sigmoid colon.\r"

The sensitivity of the single-contrast examination for detection of all polyps was 80%. Polyps 5-9 mm in size were detected with 66% sensitivity, while 94% of polyps 10 mm or larger were detected.

We have observed similar transverse folds in the gastric antrum during double-contrast upper gastrointestinal series in five patients. In contrast to the transient nature of the folds in the esophagus, these gastric folds were more persistent. They were seen in multiple spot images with the gastric antrum distended or partially collapsed and even during peristalsis. In follow-up studies, the folds were repeatedly demonstrated in two patients. Two patients had associated gastric polyps with histologic evidence of chronic gastritis; however, the antral mucosa appeared normal on endoscopy. The remaining three patients had no associated gastric disease. The pathophysiologic significance of these folds is yet to be determined; however, they appear to be clinically insignificant.\r"

The prostate had no specific signal intensity that enabled differentiation between benign and malignant changes. Each patient with known extracapsular prostatic carcinoma had a peripheral zone defect--1 cm or greater in diameter with ill-defined borders and relatively lower signal intensity than that of the remainder of the peripheral zone--that correlated with the site of clinical-pathologic involvement. Correlation of a peripheral zone defect on long TR/TE images as a sign for extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer was 100% sensitive, yet 54% specific, with excellent interobserver agreement. Stage A2 and B1 prostatic carcinoma was not detected. Benign prostatic hyperplasia was seen as centrally located proliferation and nodularity, usually with discrete margins and a wide spectrum of low- to high-signal-intensity features. MR imaging may have a role in differentiating between intracapsular and extracapsular prostatic carcinoma.\r"

Characteristic MR imaging signals obtained on T1- and T2-weighted images allowed differentiation of testis from epididymis and spermatic cord. Masses were differentiated from normal testicular parenchyma in all cases. Atrophic or ischemic testes had lower signal intensity than normal testes on T2-weighted images. Hematoma displayed a characteristic high intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Intratesticular and extratesticular pathologic conditions were readily differentiated. These results suggest that MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of scrotal and testicular abnormalities.\r"

The authors retrospectively reviewed clinical, histologic, and radiographic findings in 63 patients undergoing dialysis. In 30 patients, biopsy specimens were negative for aluminum toxicity, and in 33 patients, specimens were positive. In 21 of the 30 patients who had a negative biopsy specimen, absence of aluminum toxicity could be predicted by a high immunoreactive parathyroid hormone level (greater than 2,000 microliter Eq/ml [2,210 pM]) and fewer than three fractures, by the presence of osteosclerosis on radiographs, or if serum aluminum levels were less than 30 ng/ml. None of the patients who had a positive biopsy specimen met these criteria. In 18 of 33 patients who had a positive biopsy specimen, aluminum toxicity could be predicted by a low immunoreactive parathyroid hormone level (less than 500 microliter Eq/ml [553 pM]) and more than three fractures, or if serum aluminum levels were greater than 300 ng/ml. None of the patients who had a negative biopsy specimen met these criteria. Thus, based on the criteria identified, the aluminum status of 62% of these patients would have been correctly diagnosed.\r"

When -2 standard deviations (SDs) of the mean values in young healthy women (aged 21-45 years) were used as the lower limit of normal measurements, 47% of the subjects in group 1 showed abnormalities: in 25% both bones were abnormal, in 12% the radius alone was abnormal, and in 10% the second metacarpal alone was abnormal. Because 98% of the subjects in group 2 had abnormal CCT measurements, the -2-SD limit of the younger healthy subjects appears to constitute a satisfactory \"fracture threshold.\" Although further research and correlation are required, these simple and inexpensive measurements may be appropriate for mass screening to separate those at greater risk for development of spontaneous vertebral compressions from those at lesser risk.\r"

Undecalcified ground sections were made from 21 autopsied lumbar spines that demonstrated no evidence of disease except age-related osteoporosis. Histologic examination showed that the cartilaginous end plates were degenerated to various extents and were replaced by subchondral bone proliferation (endochondral bone formation) in the direction of the joint space. In advanced cases, this histologic finding was reflected in radiographs as a subchondral sclerotic zone protruding toward the disk space. The degree of end-plate change was positively correlated with disk-space narrowing and the vacuum phenomenon (degeneration of the nucleus pulposus) but not with osteoporosis and vertebral compression. Anatomically and functionally, this may be the most common form of degeneration at the discovertebral joint end plate. Further study will be necessary to clarify the process.\r"

Reproducibility depends on precise repositioning of the patient, selection of the region of interest (ROI), and apparatus stability. In an integrated approach, these error sources were taken into account. Dual-energy methods are incorporated and tested to avoid systematic errors. Contour-detection algorithms for automated ROI determination that work reliably and offer improved reproducibility and efficiency are presented. A new design of reference phantom with solid tissue-equivalent materials provides calibration in BMD units and checks apparatus stability. Dual-energy methods are necessary to achieve accuracy of 5% or better. Automated ROI definition and reference phantom methods are mandatory for reproducibility of 2% or better.\r"

MR imaging was as sensitive as technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy in demonstrating osteomyelitis and was more specific and more sensitive than other scintigraphic techniques in demonstrating soft-tissue infections, primarily because of its superior spatial resolution. Computed tomography, performed in seven cases, was as accurate as MR imaging in demonstrating bone and soft-tissue infections.

The normal gland was typically homogeneous with increased intensity relative to that of muscle on images obtained with long repetition times (TRs) and long echo times (TEs). Adjacent structures in the neck and upper mediastinum were well displayed. Thyroid nodules as small as 4-5 mm were identified. Follicular adenomas appeared as well-circumscribed nodules of heterogeneous intensity, increasing significantly in signal with long TRs/TEs. Colloid cysts and hemorrhagic cysts had homogeneous high signal with both short and long TRs/TEs. Two of three carcinomas were seen as poorly marginated lesions with associated cervical lymphadenopathy clearly depicted as increased intensity with long TRs/TEs. A follicular adenoma containing microscopic papillary carcinoma appeared similar to other benign adenomatoid nodules. A functioning nodule was isointense with normal gland at all pulse sequences. Characteristic patterns of diffuse abnormality were observed in cases of multinodular goiter, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and Graves disease, although additional cases are required to determine specificity. High-field-strength surface-coil MR imaging appears to be a sensitive method for identifying gross morphology of focal, multinodular, and diffuse disorders of the thyroid and involvement of surrounding structures in the neck.\r"

Solid benign nodules, malignant tumors, and inflammatory conditions were not distinguishable by thyroidal MR signal intensity, but almost all patients with Graves disease had a moderate to marked diffuse increase in signal intensity at both settings. Quantitative evaluation showed that in these patients, the thyroid-muscle signal intensity contrast ratio was linearly related to both the serum thyroxine (T4) level and the 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake. In three patients treated with iodine 131, this contrast ratio rose or fell in parallel with the serum T4 level and 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake. Either parenchymal changes or increased vascularity in Graves disease, or both, could produce these findings. In patients without Graves disease, signal intensity was not correlated with serum T4 levels. These findings suggest that MR signal intensity may reflect the activity of the stimulatory process in Graves disease and may therefore be a useful measure of thyroid function in this disorder, with both diagnostic and prognostic value.\r"

Smooth margins, lobulated margins, and pseudocapsules were found in both adenoma and papillary carcinoma, whereas unclear margins were found only in papillary carcinoma. An unclear margin between the tumor and adjacent normal thyroid tissue seemed to reflect an ill-defined tumor border on gross pathologic examination.

Orbital MR imaging may be most useful, providing information not available on computed tomography (CT), in identifying lesions in the orbital apex, superior orbital fissure, and optic canal; differentiating inflammatory pseudotumor from malignancy in clinically similar patients; characterizing lesions containing hemorrhage or other paramagnetic material; defining the posterior extent of optic pathway gliomas; and detecting abnormal flow in intraorbital vascular structures. CT seems to be superior to MR imaging in the evaluation of small perioptic meningiomas, especially those that are calcified.\r"

This technique, which makes use of small differences in the resonant frequencies of water and fat protons, provides excellent high-resolution images with simultaneous chemical shift information. In this method, there is 180 degrees opposition of phase between fat protons and water protons at the time of the gradient echo, resulting in signal cancellation in voxels containing equal signals from fat and water. In this preliminary series, advantages of spectroscopic images in orbital lesions included better lesion delineation, with superior anatomic definition of orbital apex involvement; more specific characterization of high-intensity hemorrhage with a single pulse sequence; elimination of potential confusion from chemical shift misregistration artifact; further clarification of possible intravascular flow abnormalities; and improved apparent intralesional contrast.\r"

For objectification, multiplanar reconstruction was used to complement axial plane measurements by providing coronal and sagittal measurements; multiplanar reconstruction also improved perception of the longitudinal relationships between the brain stem and subarachnoid space. A narrow subarachnoid space was found in all 26 patients; marked cord compression was present in nine, six of whom underwent CT myelography. These six had marked focal obliteration of the subarachnoid space on both plain CT and CT myelography. Since the subarachnoid space immediately above and below the craniocervical junction is normally capacious, when marked constriction was present, no additional information could have been gained from CT myelography. Thus, plain CT was shown to be sufficient for surgical planning (suboccipital decompression) in nine patients with cord compression due to achondroplasia.\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with Gd-DTPA demonstrated early disruption of the blood-ocular barrier and blood-brain barrier 5-7 days after infusion of tumor cells. Quantitative assessment of contrast enhancement revealed a mean increase in signal intensity of 145% +/- 51% in the anterior chambers, 102% +/- 70% for choroidal metastases, and 51% +/- 29% for central nervous system (CNS) metastases. These results indicate that contrast-enhanced MR imaging can be used to demonstrate a loss of blood-ocular barrier integrity that is similar to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier associated with metastatic tumors to the CNS and eye.\r"

Phase correction performed with data from phantom imaging can compensate for static field inhomogeneities but not for the other effects. A regional phase-correction algorithm is presented that removes non-chemical-shift phase effects and produces true water and fat images. The technique has been applied with good results to 21 patients and healthy volunteers. The images include ones of the abdomen, knees, hips, spine, and head. This method of regional phase correction is an efficacious way of producing separate water and fat images with the Dixon pulse sequence.\r"

Growth-dependent changes (indicated by a T1 of 630-910 msec and a T2 of 68-185 msec) can be separated into four characteristic phases. The increase in relaxation times in the early phases (A and B) is due to an increasing amount of viable tumor tissue relative to normal muscle tissue. In the later phases (C and D), a decline of the relaxation parameters is observed that is parallel to an increase in the fraction of necrotic tissue. By multiexponential analysis, two relaxation components (indicated by and, respectively) for T1 and T2 and the corresponding fractions alpha 1 and alpha 2 can be observed for both tumor and surrounding muscle tissue. A tissue criterion (\"magnetic resonance fingerprint\") is defined by a combination of these multiple parameters. This criterion allows separation of not only muscle and tumor tissue but also viable (early state) and necrotic (late state) tumor tissue.\r"

In this study, the authors compared the effectiveness of T2 calculations with that of phase images in distinguishing thrombus from flow. In 13 patients with 21 regions of questionable flow or thrombus, T2 calculations were found to have a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 88%. Phase images correctly identified thrombus or flow in all but one case with thrombus. Whenever a thrombus is suspected on the basis of MR magnitude images, reconstruction of phase images is the method of choice. However, for the positive identification of flow, T2 value calculations are often sufficient.\r"

Phantom studies and theoretical analysis demonstrated that this phenomenon arises from a loss of the flow void effect. At a certain angle, the additional phase accumulation that results from motion in the section-selection direction exactly cancels the additional phase accumulation from motion in the frequency-encoding direction. Thus, vessels that cut through the imaging plane near this critical angle have substantial signal intensity. This artifact can be eliminated by alternating the direction of the section-selection gradient on sequential phase encodings.\r"

In addition, vascular structures are often not depicted clearly because the desired flow voids are obliterated by spurious intraluminal signals. On the basis of analysis of the physical mechanism of flow artifact formation, the authors developed a new technique for suppressing these artifacts. This applies interleaved, spectrally shaped radio frequency pulses to selectively saturate spins located in regions outside the image volume. In phantom, volunteer, and clinical imaging studies, the technique has proved to be effective by yielding a striking reduction in flow artifacts and markedly improving the reliability with which arterial and venous structures are imaged. The method has few drawbacks: It is applicable to most MR pulse sequences and, in principle, can be implemented on most imagers. It is particularly helpful for high-resolution surface coil studies of the neck, mediastinal imaging, gated cardiac imaging, and for detecting thrombus and other intravascular lesions such as dissections.\r"

Specifically, the application, design, designer, economics, and universality of the algorithms must be addressed. As an alternative to the wide dissemination of clinical algorithms, the authors propose the development of consensus opinions among specialists and the promulgation of the principle of radiologist-consultant-decision maker.

Spread to contiguous structures was characteristic, and most lesions eventually involved all of the aforementioned structures.

The experience at the University of Cincinnati during the past 15 years indicates that many shunt infections can be effectively treated without shunt removal. This report summarizes experiences with 11 consecutive ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections. These were treated by externalization of the peritoneal catheter followed by intraventricular and systemic antimicrobial therapy and by later replacement of the peritoneal catheter. The advantages of this method include the avoidance of two major operative procedures and the elimination of a period in which the intracranial pressure is not controlled. The need for externalization of the peritoneal catheter relates to the occurrence of localized peritoneal infection and pseudocyst formation, which prevents cure of the infection in many instances if the catheter is left in place. After follow-up periods of four months to five years, 10 of the 11 patients have apparently been cured of their infection.\r"

On the basis of responses adequate for analysis that were received from 35 countries, three groups were identified according to the availability of antibacterial agents to the general public in a country. In one group, access by the general public to these agents was severely restricted, and restrictions were effectively enforced. In the second group, restrictions were less stringent, and enforcement was less effective. In the third group, access was unrestricted. Still to be determined is whether this grouping bears any relation to patterns of antibacterial use, resistance to antibacterial agents, and other factors pertaining to the use of these drugs.\r"

The visit gives us insights into the way the Soviets design their technology, the consequences of the accident, and the magnificent way they coped with the disaster. Although there are general conclusions to be drawn for the rest of the world, such as the realization that operators of technological systems can and will deliberately cut out safety systems, the primary specific conclusion is to be grateful that the West did not follow the Soviet route in its development of nuclear power.\r"

Autoradiographs contain enormous amounts of potentially useful data, but conventional analyses, based on tedious manual methods, can sample and analyze only a small portion of this information. Computer 3-D reconstruction provides a mechanism for observing and analyzing all the data; therefore, a system of computer programs was developed for this purpose. The programs use digital imaging methods for image registration, superimpose whole brain data sets, and allow resampling of the 3-D data in arbitrary planes for pixel-by-pixel comparisons among multiple 3-D sets. These programs operate on the mathematical properties of the images alone, obviating the need for manual image alignment. Various statistical analyses can be applied to the data directly to study the patterns of metabolic changes in different experiments. The system is applied to data from experiments on the influence of injectable anesthetics on cerebral glucose metabolism.\r"

The direct effect of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) on excised patches of rod outer segment membrane strongly supports a role for cGMP as an intracellular messenger in phototransduction. It is reported here that magnesium and calcium directly affect the conductance of excised patches of rod membrane in the absence of cGMP and that magnesium, applied to intact rod cells, blocks a component of the cellular light response. The divalent cation-suppressed conductance in excised patches showed outward rectification and cation-selective permeability resembling those of the light-suppressed conductance measured from the intact rod cell. The divalent cation-suppressed conductance was partly blocked by a concentration of the pharmacological agent L-cis-diltiazem that blocked all of the cGMP-activated conductance. Divalent cations may act, together with cGMP, as an intracellular messenger system that mediates the light response of the rod photoreceptor cell.\r"

It is not known whether the isomerization is enzyme-mediated, whether it occurs in the pigment epithelium or in the retina, or whether retinal, retinol, or a retinyl ester is the vitamin A compound that is isomerized. Radiolabeled all-trans retinol and high-performance liquid chromatography have now been used to demonstrate the existence of an eye-specific, membrane-bound enzyme (retinol isomerase) that converts all-trans to 11-cis retinol in the dark. Retinol isomerase is concentrated in the pigment epithelium; this localization clarifies the role of this tissue in rhodopsin regeneration and explains the need to transfer all-trans retinol from the rod outer segments to the pigment epithelium during the visual cycle.\r"

The basis for these modifications is a type of synaptic plasticity that may also contribute to some forms of adult learning. The question of how synapses modify according to experience has been approached by determining theoretically what is required of a modification mechanism to account for the available experimental data in the developing visual cortex. The resulting theory states precisely how certain variables might influence synaptic modifications. This insight has led to the development of a biologically plausible molecular model for synapse modification in the cerebral cortex.\r"

Although the major cerebellar cell classes are well known, a new class of cerebellar cortical neuron has now been identified with a monoclonal antibody (Mab) generated by a procedure for rapid immunization and selective immunosuppression of antibody responses. This procedure generates a high frequency of immunoglobulin G-class antibodies of desired specificity, and has allowed the generation of two antibodies that recognize subsets of cerebellar cortical neurons. One of these antibodies defines a previously unrecognized class of cerebellar neuron. The distribution and antigenic characteristics of this neuron suggest that it has a distinct role in cerebellar circuitry.\r"

  ".W": "In chicks, visual deprivation leads to myopia and enlargement of the vitreous chamber of the eye. When chicks were raised with white translucent occluders over their eyes so that either the nasal half, the temporal half, or all of the retina was visually deprived, the resulting myopia (median = -15 diopters) was limited to the deprived part of the retina, regardless of which half of the retina was visually deprived; the nondeprived part remained nearly emmetropic. Correspondingly, the vitreous chamber was elongated only in the region of the visual deprivation, resulting in eyes with different asymmetric shapes depending on which retinal region was deprived. These results argue for a local regulation of ocular growth that is dependent on vision and suggest a hypothesis to explain the epidemiological association of myopia in humans with large amounts of reading. Because most nonfoveal retinal neurons have large receptive fields, they cannot resolve the individual letters on the printed page; this may lead to their activity being less during reading than during most other forms of visual stimulation. Thus, the impoverished stimulus situation of reading may lead to myopia, as do other types of visual form deprivation.\r"

Such inversion of sensory coding and feature extraction can be achieved by optimization processes in which scalar responses derived from high-level neural analyzers are used as cost functions to modify the filter properties of more peripheral sensory relays. An optimization algorithm, Alopex, which is used in the model, is readily implemented with known neural circuitry. The functioning of the system is investigated by computer simulations.\r"

The polypeptide angiogenin induces new blood vessel growth in two biological assays and may play a role in the vascular development of the fetus and in the neovascularization that accompanies diseases and wound healing. A complementary DNA probe for human angiogenin was used to examine the tissue distribution of angiogenin messenger RNA (mRNA) in the developing rat and in selected transformed cell lines. Angiogenin mRNA was detected predominantly in adult liver but was also detectable at low levels in other tissues. The expression of the angiogenin gene in rat liver was found to be developmentally regulated; mRNA levels were low in the developing fetus, increased in the neonate, and maximal in the adult. The amount of angiogenin mRNA in human HT-29 colon carcinoma and SK-HEP hepatoma cells was not greater than that in normal rat liver. These results demonstrate that angiogenin is predominantly expressed in adult liver, that the pattern of angiogenin gene expression is not temporally related to vascular development in the rat, and that the transformed cells studied do not contain more angiogenin mRNA than does normal liver. If angiogenin activity is controlled at the transcriptional level, the results of this study suggest that the primary function of angiogenin in vivo may be in processes other than the regulation of vascular growth.\r"

  ".W": "Apparent motion was used to explore humans' ability to perceive the direction of motion in the visual field. A marked qualitative difference in this ability was found between short- and long-range motion. For short-range motion, the detection of the direction of motion is characterized by parallel operation over a wide visual field (that is, detection performance is independent of the number of objects in an array). When the positional displacement is large relative to an object's size, the direction of motion is detected in a serial manner. The process of detection is limited in this case by the ability to detect other events, such as appearance and disappearance of an object, and the ability to compute their spatio-temporal relations. The results are consistent with a previously suggested division of the motion detection system into short- and long-range processes. The direction of short-range motion can be perceived in parallel (preattentively), whereas long-range motion is attentive and requires more complicated computations. It seems that the detection of long-range motion is a conjunction task, combining the detection of disappearance and appearance.\r"

A 49-kilobase linear plasmid contained the ospA and ospB genes, which encode the major outer membrane proteins of strain B31. Molecules of the 49-kilobase plasmid rapidly reannealed after alkaline denaturation; rapid renaturation was prevented if the 49-kilobase plasmids were first treated with S1 nuclease. When denatured plasmid molecules were examined directly, single-stranded circles of approximately 100-kilobase circumference were seen. These studies provide direct visual evidence that the linear plasmids have covalently closed ends. This form of DNA occurs in some animal viruses, but it has not heretofore been described in prokaryotic organisms.\r"

The mutation has been well characterized by both biochemical and enzymological methods, but its exact nature has not been revealed. A single base substitution in the complementary DNA for ornithine transcarbamylase from the sparse fur mouse has been identified by means of a combination of two recently described techniques for rapid mutational analysis. This strategy is simpler than conventional complementary DNA library construction, screening, and sequencing, which has often been used to find a new mutation. The ornithine transcarbamylase gene in the sparse fur mouse contains a C to A transversion that alters a histidine residue to an asparagine residue at amino acid 117.\r"

  ".W": "Fragile X syndrome is a common form of mental retardation associated with a fragile site on the human X chromosome. Although fragility at this site is usually evident as a nonstaining chromatid gap, it remains unclear whether or not actual chromosomal breakage occurs. By means of somatic cell hybrids containing either a normal human X or a fragile X chromosome and utilizing two genes that flank the fragile site as markers of chromosome integrity, segregation of these markers was shown to be more frequent if they encompass the fragile site under appropriate culture conditions. Hybrid cells that reveal marker segregation were found to contain rearranged X chromosomes involving the region at or near the fragile site, thus demonstrating true chromosomal breakage within this area. Two independent translocation chromosomes were identified involving a rodent chromosome joined to the human X at the location of the fragile site. DNA analysis of closely linked, flanking loci was consistent with the position of the breakpoint being at or very near the fragile X site. Fragility at the translocation junctions was observed in both hybrids, but at significantly lower frequencies than that seen in the intact X of the parental hybrid. This observation suggests that the human portion of the junctional DNA may contain part of a repeated fragility sequence. Since the translocation junctions join heterologous DNA, the molecular cloning of the fragile X sequence should now be possible.\r"

Elastin synthesis was studied in blood vessels from newborn calves with severe pulmonary hypertension induced by alveolar hypoxia in order to investigate the cellular stimuli that elicit changes in pulmonary arterial connective tissue production. A two- to fourfold increase in elastin production was observed in pulmonary artery tissue and medial smooth muscle cells from hypertensive calves. This stimulation of elastin production was accompanied by a corresponding increase in elastin messenger RNA consistent with regulation at the transcriptional level. Conditioned serum harvested from cultures of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells isolated from hypertensive animals contained one or more low molecular weight elastogenic factors that stimulated the production of elastin in both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and altered the chemotactic responsiveness of fibroblasts to elastin peptides. These results suggest that connective tissue changes in the pulmonary vasculature in response to pulmonary hypertension are orchestrated by the medial smooth muscle cell through the generation of specific differentiation factors that alter both the secretory phenotype and responsive properties of surrounding cells.\r"

Changes in the saturation of hemoglobin S with carbon monoxide produced by varying the intensity of a photolytic laser beam were used to simulate changes in the saturation of oxyhemoglobin S produced by variations in oxygen pressure. The presence of polymer at steady-state saturation with carbon monoxide was determined by measurement of the kinetics of gelation after complete photodissociation. The kinetics are a very sensitive probe for polymer since small amounts of polymerized hemoglobin increase the rate of nucleation sufficiently to eliminate the delay period. First, the equilibrium gelation properties of partially photodissociated carbonmonoxyhemoglobin S were shown to be the same as partially oxygenated hemoglobin S, and the method was then used to determine the effect of saturation on the formation and disappearance of polymers in individual sickle cells. The saturation at which polymers first formed upon deoxygenation was much lower than the saturation at which polymers disappeared upon reoxygenation. The results indicate that at venous saturations with oxygen, gelation takes place in most cells at equilibrium, but is prevented from occurring in vivo because the delay times are sufficiently long that most cells return to the lungs and are reoxygenated before polymerization has begun.\r"

One candidate is seed of the neurotoxic plant Cycas circinalis L., a traditional source of food and medicine which has been used less with the Americanization of the Chamorro people after World War II. Macaques were fed the Cycas amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a low-potency convulsant that has excitotoxic activity in mouse brain, which is attenuated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. These animals developed corticomoto-neuronal dysfunction, parkinsonian features, and behavioral anomalies, with chromatolytic and degenerative changes of motor neurons in cerebral cortex and spinal cord. In concert with existing epidemiological and animal data, these findings support the hypothesis that cycad exposure plays an important role in the etiology of the Guam disease.\r"

To address this question, the morphological changes that retinal ganglion cells undergo during development were studied. Ganglion cells were first identified by retrograde labeling with rhodamine latex microspheres deposited in retinorecipient targets in fetal and early postnatal cats. The structure of ganglion cells was then revealed by intracellular injection of Lucifer yellow in living retinas removed and maintained in vitro. As early as 2 weeks before birth, a morphologically diverse assortment of ganglion cells is present, some of which resemble the alpha, beta, and gamma classes found in the adult. However, in contrast to the adult, developing ganglion cells exhibit several transient features, including excessive axonal and dendritic branching and exuberant somatic and dendritic spines. These morphological features indicate that there is a transient network of connectivity that could play an important role in the final determination of retinal ganglion cell form and function.\r"

Do these cells stop axonal elongation by activating the physiological mechanisms that normally operate to stop axons during development, or do they physically obstruct the elongating axons? In order to distinguish these possibilities, the cytology of the axon tips of regenerating axons that were stopped by astrocytes was compared with the axon tips that were physically obstructed at a cul-de-sac produced by ligating a peripheral nerve. The terminals of the physically obstructed axon tips were distended with neurofilaments and other axonally transported structures that had accumulated when the axons stopped elongating. By contrast, neurofilaments did not accumulate in the tips of regenerating axons that were stopped by spinal cord astrocytes at the dorsal root transitional zone. These axo-glial terminals resembled the terminals that axons make on target neurons during normal development. On the basis of these observations, astrocytes appear to stop axons from regenerating in the mammalian spinal cord by activating the physiological stop pathway that is built into the axon and that normally operates when axons form stable terminals on target cells.\r"

However, in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of the lectin concanavalin A this pattern changes, such that more than 75 percent of buccal-bag pairs exhibit electrical synapses and the frequency of occurrence of buccal-bag chemical synapses is reduced. Such changes in synaptic specificity may be important in determining the types of synapses formed during neuronal development and neurite regeneration.\r"

Now experiments have been performed in which single characterized nerve fibers were stained with horseradish peroxidase to permit the unequivocal localization of specific frequency responses in the papillae of chicks of different ages (2 and 21 days after hatching). There was no statistically significant change in the tonotopic organization of the papilla between the two groups of animals.\r"

The Eye Injury Registry of Alabama (EIRA) serves as the first and only statewide system of its kind for the collection of information on serious eye injuries. We have analyzed 736 cases of serious eye injury (injury involving permanent structural or functional change) accumulated by the EIRA between August 1982 and May 1986. Prognosis was found to be related to early diagnosis and initial vision. Individuals with follow-up vision of 20/40 or better were found in all early diagnostic groups, and 13% of patients with no light perception on initial examination had some improvement on follow-up. The worst visual prognosis was among those patients suffering blunt eyeball rupture, of whom 40% had no light perception and 25% regained vision of 20/100 or better.\r"

A review of the literature reveals that this is not true; the incidence of symptoms ranges from 7% to 41%. Even when symptoms occur, they are said to be negated by the positive emotional responses that occur. We have accumulated clinical experience relating these experiences to the development of severe psychopathology that we believe arises out of unresolved grief. Abortions affect not only the women but also their \"significant others.\" We present case reports that illustrate some of the sequelae, and we offer a method of treatment using spiritual intervention to resolve the grief.\r"

There was a discrepancy between the pretest suspicion of the referring physician and the results of the challenge test in six of these 19 patients (32%). Thus our experience suggests that bronchial challenge testing provides useful information to supplement clinical acumen in the diagnosis of asthma.\r"

The most common causes of severe hypophosphatemia (SH) in this population were infusion of dextrose solutions (73%), nutritional recovery syndrome (50%), phosphate-binding antacids (50%), and alcohol withdrawal (32%). In general, the patients were normophosphatemic at the time of hospitalization, and SH occurred early in the hospital course. All of the patients responded to the drop in serum phosphate by renal conservation of phosphate (Tm PO4/GFR less than 1.0 mg/dl GFR). Patients required small doses of phosphate to achieve a serum level above 2.0 mg/dl, with 50% of the population receiving less than 25 mmol of replacement therapy. Regardless of the route or amount of replacement therapy given, the course of SH was typically short and without sequelae.\r"

Sixteen cases were classified as urticarial vasculitis based on the major clinical manifestations, while the remaining 28 cases represented various patterns. Effectiveness of treatment was graded according to resolution of lesions, return to normal of abnormal laboratory findings, or the ability to lower the dosage of a second therapeutic agent (usually a corticosteroid). Systemic corticosteroids, azathioprine, and colchicine appeared to be effective in most patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, sulfones, antihistamines, and antimalarials were effective only in sporadic cases. We present an approach to the treatment of this type of disorder.\r"

We describe here seven cases of granular cell tumor of the esophagus diagnosed by histologic examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens.

Signs from the physical examination that correlated included reduced lumbar motion, a motor or sensory deficit, abnormal reflexes, and reduced capacity for straight leg-raising or walking. Using a clinical score incorporating these variables, we suggest a diagnostic strategy to promote more efficient and selective use of CT scans and myelograms. We project that the use of this diagnostic approach can reduce the number of myelograms ordered in a similar population by more than 50%.\r"

Many physicians believe that morbidly obese persons could lose weight if they used their willpower, that bariatric surgery is a major operation in a high-risk population, and that weight loss is unpredictable, follow-up is poor, the reoperation rate is high, and late weight gain is common. Using the results of our series of 500 vertical Silastic ring gastroplasties and a collected series of 3,237 cases, we respond to these objections. Nonsurgical methods of weight loss are successful in less than 5% of morbidly obese patients. The operative mortality in the collected cases was 0.2%. The average percentage of excess weight lost is 66%, with only 10% of patients failing to lose at least 40% of their excess weight. With diligence, a follow-up of more than 90% can be obtained. The reoperation rate among experienced surgeons averages 1% to 2% per year. Mild late weight gain occurs in about 15% of cases, but significant weight gain occurs in less than 5% of patients. We believe that vertical staple gastroplasty is safe and effective and that it should be accepted as such by the medical profession.\r"

Adherents of rootwork are medically pluralistic and seek help from a variety of practitioners when faced with illness. Adherents enter the clinical setting for the treatment of natural illnesses and present symptoms in accordance with traditional beliefs about the blood and \"folk\" categories of disease. Adherents may also consult magical practitioners, known as root doctors, for treatment of a variety of psychosocial problems.\r"

Encounter and problem activity for model practice patients constituted one fifth of the total experience. Model practice patients were older than patients, and were seen more often in the office than in the hospital. Most clinical experience with acute infections, depression, and obesity was gained with model practice patients. Most experience with pneumonia, normal delivery, myocardial infarction, and chronic lung disease was acquired with other patients, and most procedures were performed on them. Personal patients of the resident within the model practice provided the greatest experience with continuity of care.

Results were correlated with histologic node examination in all patients and each technique was assessed for sensitivity, specificity and over-all accuracy. Lymphoscintigraphy is too unreliable for routine use in the diagnosis or staging of pelvic malignant conditions. Lymphangiography detects involved lateral pelvic and para-aortic nodes but is unable to visualize the internal iliac or other medial pelvic nodes. CT scanning is only accurate if metastatic nodes are enlarged but may reveal other pathways of spread which will alter the surgical approach.\r"

Lengthening of the stomach was obtained by division of the lesser curve. In this series, the operative mortality rate was 4 per cent, morbidity was minimal and the whole procedure proved relatively easier to perform than the conventional isoperistaltic gastric esophagoplasty. There is no expected improvement in life expectancy, but morbidity decreased because of preservation of the esophagogastric drainage, thus avoiding a mucocele of the excluded esophagus and preservation of the vagus nerves.\r"

One patient with an occluded carotid artery was not actively treated, two underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the remaining patients underwent different types of vascular reconstructions. These patients frequently have other radiation lesions as well with involvement of the skin, bladder or intestine, which may make them problematic from a surgical point of view. Extra-anatomic reconstructions or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be recommended. One patient died of malignant disease three years after arterial operation. Otherwise, the results of follow-up study for these patients did not differ from other patients who underwent arterial reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "Early diagnosis and treatment of stricture of the common bile duct from chronic pancreatitis are essential as the life-threatening complications of biliary cirrhosis and acute cholangitis can occur even in the absence of clinical jaundice. In a series of 40 patients with longstanding chronic pancreatitis and stricture of the common bile duct, findings included chronic pain in 26 patients, jaundice in 17 patients, secondary biliary cirrhosis in six patients and acute cholangitis in six patients. Persistent elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level was the most sensitive laboratory indicator of occult obstruction of the biliary tract. The diagnostic long tapered stenosis of the distal common bile duct was delineated by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography in 21 of 22 patients and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in eight of 11 patients. Operative decompression of the biliary tract included 32 biliary-enteric bypasses, three sphincteroplasty procedures and three emergency tube drainages. There was one postoperative death and seven other patients had postoperative complications. Sphincteroplasty failed to relieve the obstruction in two patients and two patients with biliary-enteric bypass had late anastomotic strictures develop which required reoperation. Only seven patients were free of pain at follow-up study which ranged from 0.5 to 15.0 years. Clinical suspicion based upon persistent hyperaklalinphosphatemia, diagnosis by cholangiography and decompression of the biliary tract by choledochoenterostomy can reliably avert the lethal complications of stricture of the common bile duct caused by chronic pancreatitis.\r"

Serum amylase levels in single, second and third attacks of edematous acute pancreatitis were elevated significantly compared with those in the control group (p less than 0.01), but the concentrations were similar in the three groups and it returned to normal by the seventh day after the attack. However, the histologic finding was different. The histologic factors of the pancreas on the first day after the first attack showed interstitial edema and a mild inflammatory cell infiltration which returned to normal on the seventh day. Histologic findings on the first day of the second attack showed the same histologic changes with mild degenerative changes and partial degenerative atrophy of the acinar cells. On the seventh day after the attack, partial degenerative atrophy of the acinar cells, proliferation of the small duct and slight interstitial fibrosis remained but returned to normal one month later. On the first day after the third attack, histologic findings showed more obvious changes compared with the first and second attacks. There was much diffuse interstitial edema, a heavy inflammatory cell infiltration and massive necrosis of the acinar cells. One month later, a diffuse marked fibrosis in the interstitial space and intralobular tissue associated with small duct proliferation remained. The results indicate that repeated attacks of edematous acute pancreatitis may lead to more chronic pancreatic damage.\r"

The pathologic diagnosis revealed 11 normal appendices (8.3 per cent), 54 instances of acute appendicitis (40.6 per cent), 16 instances of gangrenous appendicitis (12.0 per cent) and 52 instances of perforated appendicitis (39.1 per cent). There were no complications in those patients with normal appendices, acute appendicitis and gangrenous appendicitis and the mean length of hospitalization for these groups was 3.27, 3.37 and 4.75 days, respectively. The mean length of hospitalization for patients with perforated appendicitis was significantly longer, 9.45 days (p less than 0.05). Thirteen complications developed in 11 patients with perforated appendicitis. Eight patients required a reoperation (a major morbidity rate of 15.4 per cent). There was only one readmission which occurred three and one-half weeks after discharge for intestinal obstruction. Early appendectomy in children with a presumed diagnosis of either acute or perforated appendicitis resulted in low morbidity rates and is more cost effective than nonoperative management proposed by others due to shorter hospitalization and no planned readmission.\r"

The rebleeding rate within 6 hours after the initial SAH was not related to age or sex of the patient; blood pressure on admission; size, shape, or site of aneurysm; or presence or absence of intracerebral hematoma or intraventricular hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) scan. The patients' clinical condition and SAH on CT scan were graded I-V. Evaluation of rebleeding of those patients with grade V was difficult. In examining the rebleeding rate in grades I-IV, the higher the grade, the greater the rebleeding. Rebleeding developed during angiography conducted within 6 hours from the initial SAH in four cases. This is approximately twofold higher than the rebleeding rate within 6 hours for the total series. It is concluded that rebleeding in the acute stage is predominant within 6 hours from the initial SAH and that this rebleeding rate is higher the more severe the initial SAH is.\r"

They represent different diagnoses including hemorrhage from aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, hemorrhage into a tumor, and spontaneous hemorrhage with no underlying lesion with and without preexisting hypertension. Analysis of these cases suggests that the hypertension induced by cocaine secondary to sympathetic stimulation may be the common factor. Cocaine may also cause arterial spasm. Although the pathophysiology has not been entirely resolved, the clinical significance of this association is clear. Intracranial hemorrhage should be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever a patient presents with an acute alteration in neurologic examination associated with cocaine use.\r"

  ".W": "Following carotid endarterectomy, early postoperative thrombosis or late restenosis occurs in up to 20% of vessels. Both complications may be related to platelet mechanisms. To assess platelet deposition at endarterectomy sites, we injected indium-111 labelled platelets in 24 men less than 30 minutes after carotid endarterectomy, with subsequent imaging 24-96 hours later. To determine if deposition decreased over time, 12 patients had follow-up studies 0.5-24 months later. For comparison, 2 control groups were studied: 1) patients with noncarotid surgery (n = 6) and 2) normal young subjects without endarterectomy and without evidence of carotid disease (n = 12). Quantitative analysis was performed performed using a deposition index that compared activity in operated with unoperated sites in surgical patients or activity in the right with left carotid arteries in normal subjects. Patients with recent endarterectomy had a mean deposition index of 1.7 +/- 0.5 (range 1.2-3.5) compared with a similarly determined ratio of 1.1 +/- 0.1 in normal subjects and 1.2 +/- 0.1 in the surgical controls (both p less than or equal to 0.05 vs. acute endarterectomy). At follow-up after endarterectomy, the mean deposition index decreased to 1.0 +/- 0.1, documenting reduced platelet deposition over time. We conclude that the arterial injury of carotid endarterectomy results in early platelet deposition, which is no longer present in most patients who are studied late. These findings suggest a reduction in platelet thrombus formation with time and are compatible with reendothelialization of the endarterectomized surface. This model may be useful for the in vivo assessment of therapies designed to reduce platelet accumulation following endothelial injury in humans.\r"

These vessels were found in all the brains examined except the lingual gyrus artery, which was present in only 8.3%. The occipital branches were noted to supply variable cortical regions. In addition, they sometimes took part in irrigation of deep forebrain structures. It was concluded that occlusion of a certain occipital artery may cause varying clinical signs and symptoms in different patients. The neurologic deficits that may occur following the isolated occlusion of individual occipital branches of the posterior cerebral artery are discussed.\r"

Another 24 SHRSP were killed soon after they showed symptoms of cerebral infarction. The initial vascular lesions observed in the asymptomatic group included focal cytoplasmic necrosis in the outer layers of the media. This change progressed to widespread medial necrosis with time. In the infarction group, numerous monocytes were seen adhering to the endothelium of the arteries having advanced medial damage. Following the adherence of monocytes to the endothelium, large amounts of plasma components were visible in the arterial wall. The accumulation of the plasma components (especially fibrin) thickened the wall, narrowed the lumen, and resulted in occlusion. These results suggest that monocytes may affect the endothelium, perhaps disturbing the so-called blood-brain barrier to proteins. The monocytes may therefore be closely related to the occurrence of arterial occlusion with resultant cerebral infarction.\r"

  ".U": "87264614\r", 
  ".W": "Secondary motor dysfunction is often observed following ischemic episodes in the central nervous system. To study potential mechanisms of postischemic motor deterioration, we developed a rabbit spinal cord ischemia model that has characteristics similar to the clinical condition termed deteriorating stroke. In this model, 70% of the rabbits regained substantial motor function by 4 hours after complete hindlimb paralysis during lumbar spinal cord ischemia; however, over the next 20 hours motor function steadily declined to the point where only 30% of the rabbits had minimal hopping function. The role of eicosanoids in spinal cord ischemia was studied by radioimmunoassay of several prostaglandins (6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGE2, and TxB2) in the spinal cord. After 5 minutes of reperfusion, TxB2 levels were markedly elevated (p less than 0.05) while 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels did not change. The TxB2:6-keto-PGF1 alpha ratio was also significantly increased. After 30 minutes of reperfusion, PGE2 levels were also elevated (p less than 0.05). Tissue edema measured by microgravimetry was also increased after 30 minutes of reperfusion in both gray and white matter. By 4 hours of reperfusion, rabbits regained near-normal hindlimb motor function while PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2, and tissue water content were back to normal. However, by 18 hours of reperfusion, when hindlimb function was deteriorating, TxB2 levels were elevated again, and edema in gray and white matter was increased as was the number of necrotic neurons observed by light microscopy. These results suggest that the secondary deterioration of motor neurologic function was due to the excess formation of TxA2 primarily in the late reperfusion phase. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate the relation of TxA2 with ischemic neural injury.\r"

  ".W": "Middle cerebral artery occlusions (MCAo) in rats produce infarcts in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortex, extending into the lateral basal ganglia and parasagittal cortex. We estimated tissue H2O concentrations from wet and dry weight measurements and determined Na and K concentrations by atomic absorption spectroscopy in these areas of rat brains. Tissue samples were analyzed at 2, 4, and 24 hours after MCAo and sham MCAo, compared with normal values measured in unoperated rats. In the pyriform and frontoparietal areas, H2O concentrations increased to 34 and 7% greater than normal by 2 hours, and 89 and 94% by 24 hours after MCAo. Na concentrations rose in these areas to 73 and 37% greater than normal by 2 hours, and 281 and 330% by 24 hours. K concentrations did not change until 4 hours, but fell to 62 and 34% of normal in these areas by 24 hours. Such large ion shifts indicate severe tissue destruction. In the parasagittal cortex and basal ganglia areas, the ion and water changes were smaller and did not become significant until 24 hours after MCAo. Rates of Na entry into the infarct site were greatest at 0-2 hours, while the rates of K loss peaked later, between 2 and 4 hours. The difference in Na influx and K efflux resulted in net ion shifts that correlated highly with water entry, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.992 (p less than 0.001) and a slope indicating that 1 ml of water entered the tissue with each 145 mumoles of ions. These findings strongly suggest that net ion shifts cause the early edema of regional brain ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Entry of Ca ions into ischemic neurons is believed to cause cell damage. Although several investigators have demonstrated changes in extracellular Ca ionic activity consistent with Ca movement into cells, direct and quantitative evidence for Ca entry into ischemic cells is lacking. We used atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure the regional distribution of tissue Ca contents of rat brains sampled at 2, 4, and 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). At 4 hours after MCAo, Ca concentrations increased significantly (p less than 0.005) in the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory, i.e., the pyriform and frontoparietal cortices, but not in the surrounding brain. At 24 hours, Ca concentrations in the pyriform and frontoparietal cortex were respectively 30.79 (+/- 2.90) and 29.19 (+/- 3.28) mumol/g dry tissue wt compared with 11.9 (+/- 1.7) mumol/g in sham-occluded rats. Tissue Ca concentration changes in the parasagittal cortex and basal ganglia adjacent to the infarct site were much smaller and did not differ significantly from controls until 24 hours. In the ischemic middle cerebral artery territory, greater than 1.0 mumoles of Ca entered per gram of dry tissue weight per hour during the first 4 hours after MCAo. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.9722) between changes in tissue Ca and water, with a slope indicating that 5.88 mumoles of Ca accompanied each milliliter of water entering the lesioned hemisphere. Such massive accumulations of Ca not only confirm Ca entry into injured cells, but indicate the presence of a remarkable Ca sink which sequestered within 24 hours more than 17 times the amount of free Ca present in the tissue before MCAo.\r"

  ".W": "Peptides derived from each of the 3 endogenous opioid precursors were measured in gerbil brain regions at various times after transient bilateral carotid artery occlusion using radioimmunoassays specific for beta-endorphin-, met-enkephalin-, and dynorphin A-related peptides. Lasting changes were observed only in the hippocampus. The most striking effect was on dynorphin A immunoreactivity, which was reduced by 30-40% as early as 1 hour after recirculation and remained at 50% of the control level for at least 1 week. In some experiments dynorphin levels showed a transient recovery at 24 hours. These results demonstrate a unique sensitivity of the dynorphin-containing dentate granule cell-mossy fiber pathway to transient ischemia. Although these cells remain histologically intact, the decrease in dynorphin level precedes and continues during the delayed loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons characteristic of this model and further defines the selective vulnerability of hippocampal circuitry following ischemia. These observations clearly identify the hippocampus as a well-defined brain region in which further studies of the postischemic pathophysiology of endogenous opioid peptides may provide a rational basis for evaluating the place of opiate pharmacology in stroke treatment.\r"

Measurements were performed during a standard resting baseline condition and during the performance of standardized verbal analogies and spatial line orientation tasks. Resting and activated CBF were lower in patients than in controls, and there were differences in the hemispheric pattern of activated CBF. Control subjects replicated earlier findings of asymmetric increase in CBF for the cognitive tasks, whereas patients showed abnormalities in lateralized CBF changes consistent with side of infarction. These findings underscore the utility of cognitive challenges in the study of rCBF in stroke. This can lead to an experimental paradigm in clinical studies of the relation between behavioral deficits and regional brain dysfunction and may also improve the utility of CBF measurements in clinical settings.\r"

Postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion was significantly improved in the ibuprofen pretreatment group. Control dogs showed significant increases in sagittal sinus postischemic thromboxane B2 concentrations, but pretreated dogs showed nearly complete inhibition of postischemic thromboxane B2 production. Pretreated dogs also had significantly lower levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from the sagittal sinus. There were no significant differences in the other variables at any interval. We conclude that ibuprofen ameliorates postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion, and that this improvement is associated with decreased sagittal sinus levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha.\r"

The objective of these experiments was to determine if U 46619, a stable thromboxane A2 mimetic, affects the cerebral microcirculation in vivo. Pial arteriole diameter in rabbits and rats was measured with a microscope using the closed cranial window technique. Topical application of 10(-11) to 10(-6) M U 46619 induced dose-dependent arteriole vasoconstriction in both species. In rabbits and rats the maximum vasoconstriction was 9.7 +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SEM) and 14.0 +/- 0.5%, respectively. In rats, 10(-7) and 10(-6) M U 46619 induced intravascular platelet aggregation accompanied by a further decrease in diameter and transient occlusion of the arterioles and venules. U 46619 had no significant effect on rabbit pial arterioles that were predilated by hypercapnia or hypercapnia plus hypoxia. Our data suggest that in animals with a normal vasculature, thromboxane A2 may be a moderate constrictor of cerebral arterioles and that this constrictor effect is prevented by hypercapnia and hypoxia.\r"

At carotid endarterectomy, the venous-stasis retinopathy was found to be associated with venous thrombosis distant from the eye and in the internal jugular vein. This site is beyond the range over which isolated ocular vascular effects would be expected and was thought to be unrelated to the hemodynamically insignificant, nonulcerated carotid artery plaque.

This adherence is prevented by serum components apoprotein B, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, or serum diluted less than 75-fold, but not by serum albumin or immunoglobulin fractions. A high concentration of serum reduces the sensitivity of the test and destabilizes antibody-dependent aggregation. Disaggregation time (DT), defined as the time required for antibody-dependent aggregates to disperse, was used as an indicator of agglutination stability. DT was often shortened when antibodies were in native serums, but could be prolonged if serums were diluted with 0.85 percent saline. Other factors that influenced DT included antibody concentration, temperature, specificity, and sources of antibodies within specificities. When antibodies were present in a mixture, they produced various DTs related to individual specificities. Determination of these differences allowed the successful identification of multiple antibodies. The procedure, called differential disaggregation time, was also used for typing red cells coated by autoantibodies. Additional modifications improved the performance of the antiglobulin phase.\r"

The absence of sialoglycoproteins alpha and delta, as seen in En(a-) and S-s-U- cells, respectively, results in cells with normal morphology, but the absence of sialoglycoproteins beta and gamma is associated with elliptocytosis. However, cells that lack Gerbich (Ge) antigens but have an abnormal sialoglycoprotein reactive with antibodies to beta have normal morphology. The authors used a monoclonal antibody specific for beta to explore the nature of this abnormal sialoglycoprotein and its interactions with other membrane proteins. The beta-like sialoglycoprotein of Ge-Yus- red cells appears to react poorly with some antibodies due to steric hindrance by other molecules of sites normally available to immune agglutinins. This steric hindrance is not due to a single interaction with either sialoglycoprotein alpha or delta or band 3. Furthermore, steric hindrance by other molecules does not account for the lack of Ge antigens on these cells.\r"

After in vivo treatment with pentoxifylline, the serologic expression of the Wrb antigen increased.

To determine whether red cell concentrates may be centrifuged in a blood center and filtered subsequently at an outlying facility, the authors examined how leukocyte removal was affected by the transport and storage of centrifuged red cells before microaggregate filtration (MAF). One hundred fourteen red cell units were each divided into two aliquots. After centrifugation, one aliquot from each unit was retained in the blood center, and the other was transported on a truck for 2 to 12 hours. Aliquots were stored for variable periods, after which the residual leukocytes were counted. Neither transportation nor storage significantly affected leukocyte removal by MAF. However, an unacceptable proportion of all SCF units failed to meet American Red Cross standards for leukocyte-poor blood and studies of factors influencing leukocyte depletion were undertaken. A relative centrifugal force of 6700 X g was needed to produce consistently acceptable units when blood was 8 to 15 days old. These results show that making SCF red cells is a practical, inexpensive way for blood centers to provide hospitals with products that prevent most FNHTR; however, each facility that prepares these products must perform quality control carefully.\r"

  ".W": "The changes in thrombocyte proteins during 22 degrees C storage of platelet concentrates (PC) were studied. To prepare a reference protein \"map\" of stored PC, platelet samples were taken on days 1, 7, and 21. The platelet proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing (first-dimension) followed by second-dimension polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecylsulfate (2D). The silver-stained gels were analyzed by computer to obtain a composite map of stored PC proteins. The pattern seen on day 1 changed during 7 days of storage, with 30 proteins increasing or decreasing in spot density. In general, the spot density for lower-molecular-weight proteins increased, whereas that for higher-molecular-weight proteins decreased. Membrane proteins of intact fresh and stored platelets were labeled with 3H using sodium metaperiodate-[3H]NaBH4 and with 125I using lactoperoxidase-H2O2. A comparison on the fluorographs of 2D gels of [3H]NaBH4-labeled platelet proteins showed several protein spots in the stored Day 7 sample that had not been seen in the Day 1 sample. Similarly, for the autoradiographs, several 125I-labeled proteins detected in Day 7 PC were not seen in the Day 1 samples. The results provide evidence that platelet proteins are altered during PC storage and that these changes involve platelet membrane proteins.\r"

  ".U": "87264744\r", 
  ".W": "Glutathione and glutathione disulfide decline rapidly and progressively in human platelet concentrates stored for up to 7 days at 22 degrees C. Total glutathione declines progressively throughout the storage period, with an estimated half-disappearance time of 2 days. Glutathione disulfide remains constant during the first 2 days of storage but declines progressively thereafter, with an estimated half-disappearance time of 3.2 days. Based on measurements of glutathione disulfide in freshly collected platelets, the authors postulate that glutathione disulfide is elevated during the production of platelet concentrates or during the first 2 days of storage, accounting for the lag in its decay curve. Since total glutathione decreases more rapidly than glutathione disulfide, the fraction of glutathione present in the oxidized form increases throughout the storage period. Glutathione-dependent mechanisms maintain essential cell proteins in the appropriate redox states and provide avenues for the detoxification of potentially noxious compounds generated by the cell or within its environment. Changes in platelet glutathione and glutathione disulfide during storage may be responsible for storage-dependent alterations in in vitro functions and may also affect subsequent in vivo recovery and survival upon reinfusion.\r"

A peripheral blood film taken immediately after leukapheresis showed numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear fragments. The patient's clinical course thereafter was significantly compromised by disseminated intravascular coagulation with a severe bleeding diathesis, renal failure, and respiratory failure that led to her death. This case illustrates that therapeutic leukapheresis for elevated WBC in patients with acute leukemia may result in leukocyte fragmentation and possible intravascular coagulation.\r"

Lymphocyte concentrates (LC) containing 6.51 X 10(9) mononuclear cells were obtained by standard leukapheresis techniques. Disposable apheresis kits were modified to allow the LC to be pumped into a separation chamber along with a counter-centrifugal flow of saline, removing the platelets and plasma by elutriation. The remaining cells were underlaid with 300 ml of FH, displacing the lymphocytes into a collection bag, where they were washed and concentrated. Mean leukocyte recovery was 59.2 percent (99.9% lymphocytes, n = 14). The final product contained 6.7 percent of the initial platelets and had a hematocrit of less than 1 percent. In paired studies using split leukocyte concentrates (n = 15), lymphocyte recovery obtained by the automated apheresis technique compared favorably with that obtained by standard manual FH gradients (59.8 +/- 3.4% versus 67.3 +/- 4.2%, p greater than 0.05) and platelet contamination was significantly reduced (2.7 +/- 0.5% versus 26.6 +/- 5.7% residual platelets, p less than 0.001). Equivalent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity was generated from cells isolated by both manual and automated techniques. An automated continuous-flow cell separator can be used for rapid FH isolation of large numbers of lymphocytes, providing a sterile product suitable for human use.\r"

Of 16 other patients prospectively evaluated on admission, only 1 had frankly abnormal levels of fibrinopeptide A unaccompanied by other coagulation abnormalities. Occasional individuals had minimal, negligible deviations of partial thromboplastin times, thrombin time, or antithrombin III values. In none of these patients did hemostatic complications develop during their hospital stay. These results demonstrate that although an occasional coagulation abnormality may occur in patients with cancer of the prostate (albeit with a lower incidence than in other neoplasms), this malignancy does not require increased precautions with respect to those given to the patient population at large.\r"

This operation is particularly suitable for patients showing pudendal or common penile artery obstruction at arteriography. Optimal distal perfusion is obtained by a cross end-to-side anastomosis of the distal stump of the dorsal artery to the contralateral dorsal penile artery.

Thirty-seven of these patients had this method of diversion employed as palliation for pelvic malignancies. In 70 per cent of the patients diversion was done secondary to ureteral obstruction and in the other patients because of either severe lower urinary tract symptoms or a failed alternate form of diversion. Forty-nine per cent of the patients experienced a postoperative complication. The late postoperative complications were either related to the choice of diversion or presumed progression of the patient's disease. Palliative diversion is now best initially attempted with percutaneous nephrostomy or indwelling ureteral stents if bladder function allows. Cutaneous ureterostomy no longer is indicated as a primary form of palliative diversion, however, it may be used as an alternative to open nephrostomy tube placement or intestinal conduit should other more conservative forms of management fail. The presence of at least one dilated ureter is a prerequisite to the success of this form of diversion.\r"

Platelet serotonin level in patients with prostatic cancer was lower than in patients with BPH (p less than 0.01), whereas plasma serotonin level in patients with prostatic cancer (within normal ranges in our series) was lower than in patients with BPH (p less than 0.001). Levels of 2 intraplatelet proteins, beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4) in the two groups of patients were similar. However, levels of beta-TG were elevated significantly in both groups of patients compared with those of healthy individuals. These studies revealed that the platelet serotonin levels in advanced prostatic cancer patients differed significantly from those in patients with BPH. The platelet serotonin level thus may provide an index of platelet activation in patients with prostatic cancer.\r"

The amount of alcohol used was estimated on the basis of answers to a self-filled structured questionnaire. The incidence of SCD was statistically significantly lower among abstainers than among alcohol consumers. The relative risk of SCD of alcohol consumers in comparison with abstainers was largest in the oldest age group and it became more apparent after a follow-up of a couple of years. Only the consumption of spirits was positively associated with the incidence of SCD. Among non-smokers the incidence of SCD was statistically significantly higher in consumers than in abstainers, a similar but not significant trend was observed among current smokers. The positive association between alcohol consumption and incidence of SCD was detected both in CHD-free men and in men with prior CHD. Consumption of alcoholic beverages, and in particular of spirits, is associated with an increased risk of SCD in Finnish men.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid latex agglutination test for the detection of elevated levels of myoglobin in serum was evaluated in a prospective study of 236 patients consecutively admitted to a Coronary Care Unit on suspicion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The final diagnosis was made according to the WHO criteria. The prevalence of AMI was 0.45 with a male to female ratio of 2:1. In all patients at least two blood samples were collected with 4 hours interval 4-12 hours after the onset of symptoms. All sera were analysed for myoglobin by a latex agglutination test and by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). The latex test was performed twice, first as an emergency test by the technical assistant on duty and later by another well-trained technical assistant as her daily routine work. If the latex test was carried out each day by the same well-trained technical assistant, the test results agreed well with the RIA test results, and the false-negative fraction for patients with AMI constituted 0.06 and the false-positive fraction for patients without AMI 0.46. However, when the latex test was performed by the occasional technical assistant on duty, a relatively high degree of discrepancy was observed between the latex test results and the RIA test results, thus giving a false-negative fraction of 0.11 and a false-positive one of 0.36. In conclusion, performed under optimal laboratory conditions, the latex test can be used as a reliable method to estimate elevated levels of serum myoglobin. However, used as a bedside emergency examination, the test results correlated rather poorly to the RIA test results, and consequently the latex myoglobin test seems to be of minor clinical importance in the early evaluation of patients with suspected AMI.\r"

Fifty-four women (11.3%) were found to have palpable goitre; 45 of these were unaware of their disorder. All goitres were considered to be benign. One woman with goitre had a mild thyrotoxicosis; the goitres in the other 53 women were atoxic. Seventy-six women (16.0%) had been subjected to surgical breast biopsy 1-25 years before the present survey (median 9 years). The histological diagnoses were: cancer 1, fibroadenoma 8, cystic disease 48, fibrosis 9, and miscellaneous 10. A correlation between atoxic goitre and histologically verified benign breast disease was found (p less than 0.05). The correlation was explained solely by an association between goitre and fibrosis of the breast (p less than 0.001). This study shows a correlation between fibrosis of the breast and atoxic goitre in middle-aged women. The correlation is considered to be a true one, and a possible explanation is briefly discussed.\r"

After the first year of the study, four barbiturates were withdrawn from the Norwegian market and recommendations were made by the Health Authorities to promote more restrictive attitudes when prescribing psychoactive drugs. The patterns of self-poisonings in the two periods were compared. The withdrawal of four barbiturates resulted in a 55% decrease in the rate of barbiturate poisonings in general (p less than 0.001). No increase could be detected in the rate of self-poisoning with benzodiazepines and other hypnotics, but the incidence of self-poisonings with antidepressants (p less than 0.01) and neuroleptics (p less than 0.01) was found to have increased significantly. The regulations and recommendations resulted in a significant decrease in drugs obtained from doctors randomly consulted (p less than 0.01), and a significant increase in drugs prescribed by psychiatrists (p less than 0.01). Drugs obtained from non-medical sources increased from 28% in the first period to 33.2% in the second. The total number of admissions and toxic agents taken remained unaltered. Thus, regulatory measures can influence the pattern of self-poisoning but do not seem to influence the tendency to abuse drugs or to take an overdose.\r"

Four episodes of hypercalcemic crisis with mean serum calcium concentrations of 4.43 mmol/l were controlled within 4-6 days of intravenous clodronate (4 mg/kg BW/day). This was accompanied by a moderate increase in serum creatinine values which, however, returned to pretreatment levels after therapy withdrawal in all but one case. Oral clodronate successfully reduced a mean serum calcium concentration of 3.16 mmol/l in 22 out of 25 patients after 3-12 days (800-3,200 mg/day). After reversal of the hypercalcemias oral clodronate controlled the serum calcium concentration for up to 42 weeks in six out of 15 patients After discontinuation of initial therapy five of seven recurrent hypercalcemias were successfully treated with oral or intravenous clodronate. Hypocalcemia and subjective side-effects were uncommon. It is concluded that clodronate is a valuable clinical tool in the management of patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia.\r"

The patient was treated conservatively with laparocentesis and diuretics. Clear improvement was seen after two weeks, and after four weeks she had no ascites and could be discharged. All liver function tests were then normalized. After three months, all diuretics could be withdrawn, and in the following 11 years she has remained completely recovered. The case illustrates that also widespread thrombi of the hepatic veins may sometimes rapidly dissolve spontaneously, with apparent total reconstitution of hepatic function. This case is unusual since previously reported cases have had high mortality rates and, in surviving cases, operative procedures or large doses of diuretics have been required to control the ascites.\r"

Pasteurella multocida is found in about 25 percent of dog bites and a higher percentage of cat bites. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci are the most frequent isolates from human bite wounds. Anaerobic bacteria are commonly found in all types of infected bites.\r"
