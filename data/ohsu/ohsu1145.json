  ".W": "Because morphine has been shown to alter the function of human T lymphocytes and monocytes, we postulated that morphine would promote the growth of HIV-1 in these cells. To test this hypothesis, a coculture assay was used consisting of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from normal donors and PBMC which had been infected with a viral isolate from an asymptomatic patient, HIV-1AT. The growth of HIV-1AT, as reflected by the concentration of p24 antigen in coculture supernatants, was markedly increased in cocultures that contained morphine. A bell-shaped dose-response curve was observed with three- to fourfold increased growth at a morphine concentration of 10(-12) M. Augmentation of HIV-1AT growth by morphine required an interaction with the PHA-activated donor PBMC. Furthermore, potentiation of HIV-1AT growth by morphine was stereospecific and was antagonized by naloxone and beta-funaltrexamine indicating involvement of an opiate receptor mechanism. These findings provide an additional explanation of how opiates could act as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 in intravenous drug users.\r"

On zidovudine there was a reduction of p24Ag to 21.12% (s.e. 4.76) of pretreatment values at 3 months; however, there was a subsequent trend for levels after 6 months to increase to greater than 50% of pretreatment levels at 12 months. Serum levels of anti-p24 were measured in 26 patients. Of 16 patients whose serum contained p24Ag and 10 whose serum did not, four and nine, respectively, had detectable levels of anti-p24. There was no significant change in the serum anti-p24 with zidovudine therapy.\r"

The expressed CA is soluble, recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against HIV CA and has an N-terminal sequence identical to that of CA purified from HIV. Purification was done under mild conditions where coexpressed HIV PR retained enzymatic activity. Milligram quantities of 90% pure CA protein were obtained after chromatography on DEAE cellulose followed by facilitated aggregation of the CA in the unbound fraction. The precipitated CA was readily dissolved in low ionic strength aqueous buffer. Gel exclusion chromatography results indicated that, in solution, CA existed in oligomeric form.\r"

The second population (96 patients) did not receive this therapy. The measured quality of life parameters included a number of global and psychological well-being measurements and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), as well as energy, activity levels, appetite, work, and sexual function. When adjusted for covariates (health status and demographics), 16 of 26 parameters were significantly higher (p less than .05) in patients receiving epoetin beta. All mean scores for global measurements were significantly higher. Significantly higher scores were also obtained for total SIP and total psychosocial subscale, as well as for sleep, home management, recreation, emotional behavior, social interaction, ability to work, and energy. While not statistically significant, all of the remaining measurements were higher for epoetin beta than for untreated patients.\r"

Satisfactory results were obtained. In animal experiments, serial sampling of thoracic duct lymph by cannulation and serial samplings of peripheral vein blood after injection of MMC-charcoal solution into the subserosal space of the intestinal wall were made to study the pharmacodynamics of the lymph-blood system through analysis of MMC regression curves. Clearance (K) and half-life (t1/2) are calculated from the formula; C(t) = C(t0) X e-kt, and compared with that of MMC-saline. Activated charcoal has a proven ability to transport MMC to the lymphatic system. With activated charcoal, MMC is retained for much longer in the lymph nodes than with saline. Congestion of the lymph system was produced by ligation of the thoracic duct in CH-40, with 25% prolongation of t1/2. In conclusion, these drug delivery systems are suitable for targeting chemotherapy at lymph node metastases, and it is proven that 1500 AA Mitsubishi ultrafine charcoal is a good carrier of drug and a slow drug-release material in the lymphatics. Minimal side effects are expected because of the constant low concentrations in the general circulation.\r"

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and/or P. vesicularis were found in the blood cultures of three patients in whom four pyrogenic reactions developed. The cluster occurred only in patients treated with formaldehyde-reused dialyzers. Pseudomonads were also cultured from the effluent of two dialyzers reprocessed with formaldehyde and not yet used; these two dialyzers had extremely low formaldehyde concentrations. The tap water used for dialyzer rinsing in the reuse procedure contained only 220 colony forming units/ml pseudomonads. The problem appeared to be related to the inadequate mixing of the sterilant with the tap water used in the automated reprocessing device--in the absence of an alarm for this failure. After immediate discontinuation of the reuse procedure with this device (that had been in use for 6 years) no further septicemic episodes were registered. It is concluded that septicemias may occur despite a bacteriologic contamination level of water conforming to preset standards. Such episodes can be avoided only by total water decontamination.\r"

We report lipid and apo values over 12-14 months in 55 hemodialysis (HD) and 40 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. For HD patients, mean TC fell, but not significantly, and HDL-C and TC/HDL-C, an atherogenic risk ratio, did not change over time. Apo A-I/apo B correlated with months on HD (r = 0.30, p less than 0.04) and rose significantly (p less than 0.005) during the study period. Paired t-test analysis by race, gender, and diabetes showed that in nondiabetics, apo A-I rose, apo B fell (p less than 0.05), and apo A-I/apo B improved (p less than 0.002). Similar trends were seen in all subgroups except for diabetics. For CAPD patients, total months of treatment correlated with TC/HDL-C (r = 0.46, p less than 0.05) and with HDL-C (r = -0.53, p less than 0.02), but paired t-test analysis of longitudinal data showed no significant changes in TC, HDL-C, apo A-I, apo B, TC/HDL-C, or apo A-I/apo B. The lipoprotein patterns of all patients who died were not significantly different from those of the surviving patients. Our longitudinal data reveal that lipids, apolipoproteins, and risk ratios remain stable over time on HD and CAPD. In fact, the anti-atherogenic index of apo A-I/apo B improved in HD patients, especially in nondiabetics.\r"

Of these, 36 patients (19%) have continued uninterrupted home hemodialysis for 10 or more years (mean 14 years). To ascertain which factors might predict long duration on home hemodialysis these 36 long-term patients (LT) were compared to the entire group (all). Mean age at initiation of dialysis was 36 years in LT and 40 years in all. There was no significant difference in gender between LT and all. A significantly greater (p less than 0.01) proportion of LT (72%) were white compared with the whole group (53%). Seventy-eight percent of LT were middle class while 67% of the entire group were middle class (p less than 0.05). Renal diagnosis in LT were glomerulonephritis in ten (28%) polycystic kidney disease in eight (22%) congenital and/or infectious renal disease in eight (22%), miscellaneous or unknown in the rest. Hereditary disease thus accounted for 36% of all LT. Twenty-four LT remain on home hemodialysis, four returned to center dialysis and nine died. The authors conclude that 1) Home hemodialysis for a decade or longer is not rare in selected patients. 2) White, middle class men remain on home hemodialysis the longest. Although declining in popularity, this treatment modality proffers survival advantage for appropriately chosen individuals.\r"

HD consisted of four periods of about 60 min each. One half with an UF rate greater than 1,000 ml/h, followed by a time interval of 30 min without UF resulting in a \"saw tooth\" profile of BV. Decrease in BV was measured by continuous hemoglobinometry. Average total decrease in BV was 25%, while BP and HR did not change significantly. E, NE, ANF and ADH levels were directly related to actual changes in BV, suggesting that BP regulation in this special mode of HD is mainly supported by endogenous catecholamine and ADH secretion. The second messenger cGMP did not follow actual BV changes, but showed a significant decrease correlated with diminished BV. A significant change in PRA and ALD was missing. It is concluded that vascular stability in these patients is maintained by the response of catecholamins and ADH to decrease in blood volume, and not by the renin-aldosterone system.\r"

In a series of 49 patients, a nadir in PMN metabolic activity, when compared with healthy controls, was reached in a subgroup treated for less than 24 months (n = 24, latex: 109.5 +/- 10.1 vs. 233.7 +/- 11.8; zymosan: 181.9 +/- 18.9 vs. 407.8 +/- 19.3 DPM/10(3) PMNs; p less than 0.01). In patients treated by dialysis for longer than 24 months, PMN metabolic function was significantly better, resulting in partial correction of the defect for both latex and zymosan. Phagocyte CO2 production in response to latex or zymosan correlated significantly with years of dialysis treatment (r = 0.63 and 0.56, respectively, n = 49; p less than 0.001). These findings may have implications for phagocyte reactivity towards infection, bioincompatible dialyzer membranes, and renal transplantation.\r"

During 12 hours of ECMO with a bypass flow of 500 ml/min, there were no significant differences in gas exchange or blood trauma between the two groups. There was no apparent macroscopic thrombus formation in either group. In addition, it was suggested that Group 1 had less activation of platelets on the blood-contacting surfaces compared with Group 2. This ECMO system, with simplified circuits using a centrifugal pump, showed efficient gas exchange and antithrombogenicity when coated with heparin using a covalent binding method comparable to the non heparin coated system requiring systemic heparinization.\r"

Special features of this ECMO method include: 1. using a pneumatic diaphragm type VAD with excellent blood compatibility as a pump system; 2. using a newly developed, high performance, compact oxygenator, with a novel gas exchange membrane in which micropores are blind at the blood contacting surface; 3. regional anticoagulation within the ECMO circuit with short-acting protease inhibitor FUT-175; and 4. right heart bypass with direct cannulation through a thoracotomy. Four goats implanted with a VAD between the right atrium and the pulmonary artery underwent ECMO by interposing a compact oxygenator in the return cannula for as long as 14 days. Blood clotting was regulated with continuous infusion of FUT-175 from the inflow cannula of the ECMO circuit. In this system, 2 to 4 L/min of bypass flow, 80 to 120 ml/min of O2, and 40 to 80 ml/min of CO2 gas exchange were obtained. Serum leakage in the oxygenator did not occur, and various blood chemical and hematologic parameters were maintained within the normal range. Regional anticoagulant therapy was successfully achieved with a significant difference of activated clotting time between the blood samples from the systemic circulation and those from the ECMO circuit. These results indicate that this method overcomes several problems with ECMO, and has the capacity for long-term respiratory assistance.\r"

The silicon material conventionally used can result in sinus formation between the skin and the catheter, and may trigger exit site infections. To resolve this problem, we employed a bioinert, rigid, and nonporous transcutaneous connector made of alumina ceramic. Earlier long-term animal experiments with alumina ceramic placed in soft tissue demonstrated the outstanding biocompatibility of this material. The transcutaneous connector was designed with a simple cylindrical configuration; in order to make sufficient contact between this connector and the patient, a silicon tube was made into a swan neck catheter with a disk-shaped Dacron cuff at the upper position in order to reinforce adhesion to soft tissue. Ten CAPD patients (maximum time on dialysis of 14 months) have used the new CAPD catheter system with no exit site infections to date. Furthermore, there has been virtually no downgrowth of the skin around the connector, while the connector and tissue have remained in very close contact.\r"

Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment. This scale was based on serial assessments of albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference. Each variable was compared with established standards before implantation and before transplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0 points if within the normal range. At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patients had a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a score greater than 5. At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of 0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5. The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric and protein requirements by oral intake alone were noted. At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met this requirement at the time of cardiac transplantation. All 9 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 8 survived. Thus, it appears that extended LVAD support and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain the desire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerably reduce their perioperative transplant risks.\r"

Since low molecular weight heparin has been available, several advantages over standard heparin were observed, especially in long-term use during hemodialysis. In 27 patients, we found a lower bleeding risk, a lower need for erythrocyte transfusions, a lesser increase in activity of various coagulation factors, and lower triglyceride levels. Therefore, low molecular weight heparin would appear to be a good alternative to standard heparin in dialysis patients.\r"

  ".U": "91069785\r", 
  ".W": "All CO2 in blood is in equilibrium, catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (CA). This has prompted some investigators to consider treating ventilatory failure by using dialysis to remove HCO3-. Since there is at least 18 times more CO2 in the form of HCO3- than dissolved CO2, theoretically, lower blood flows could be used than with current extracorporeal support with artificial membrane lungs. HCO3- removal for ventilatory support has required alkalinization to compensate for the resulting acidosis and has been capable of removing 26 to 38 ml CO2/100 ml blood flow, compared to 14 ml CO2/100 ml for clinically employed silicone membrane lungs. We designed a HCO3- removal system using recirculation of dialysate through a membrane lung to remove CO2, rather than alkalinization of blood, and removed 8.8 ml CO2/100 ml. Adding CA improved this to 12.2 ml CO2/100 ml, but a conventional hollow fiber lung removed 30 ml CO2/100 ml. We conclude that the complexities of an HCO3- removal system may not be necessary with the advent of more efficient hollow fiber lungs.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two women with endometriosis were treated with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist buserelin for 6 months. At second-look laparoscopy the mean score of endometriosis had decreased from 23.1 (SD 17.0) to 17.2 (SD 20.2) (P less than 0.05). CA 125 serum levels decreased from 38.4 (SD 32.2) U/ml at diagnosis to 15.5 (SD 7.0) at second look (P less than 0.005). CA 125 levels correlated at diagnosis with total score of endometriosis (P less than 0.05) and with active score of endometriosis (P less than 0.05), but not with the adhesion score. CA 125 levels were not correlated with endometriosis scores at second look laparoscopy, thus suggesting that mechanisms other than the change in the extent of the disease may be involved in the CA 125 decrease during therapy. CA 125 levels may therefore not be a reliable indicator for monitoring the efficacy of LHRH agonist treatment of endometriosis.\r"

DESIGN--Retrospective study of women undergoing second trimester termination, over 3 1/2 years, with extra-amniotic ethacridine alone, or extra-amniotic ethacridine supplemented later by extra-amniotic 15-methyl prostaglandin F2 alpha. SETTING--Teaching hospital in Bombay. PATIENTS--315 consecutive women undergoing late abortions with extra-amniotic ethacridine. Demographic features were similar in the two groups. INTERVENTIONS--In group 1, 207 women had 150 ml of 0.1% ethacridine lactate injected slowly into the extra-amniotic space. In group 2, 108 women had the initial injection supplemented 6 h later by an extra-amniotic injection of 250 micrograms (1 ml) of 15-methyl prostaglandin F2 alpha. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of abortion following the induction procedure. The development of complications such as haemorrhage, infection, or injury to the uterus or cervix. RESULTS--The method was successful in 191 women (92%) in group 1 and in 106 (98%) in group 2. The median induction-abortion intervals were 35 and 19 h, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, P less than 0.001). The corrected complication rate was less than 10% (30 women), with unplanned uterine evacuation in 6% (20), haemorrhage in 1% (4), and pelvic infection in 4% (14). CONCLUSION--The use of extra-amniotic ethacridine lactate provides an effective and safe treatment method for second trimester legal abortion. The induction-abortion interval can be appreciably reduced by supplementary prostaglandin.\r"

The prorenin peak coincided with the LH surge and preceded the rise of progesterone, whereas renin was below the detection limit during the whole cycle. These findings indicate that the rise in prorenin during the menstrual cycle is not of renal origin but is probably due to increased production by the ovary and supports the increasing evidence for the existence of a local renin-angiotensin system in the ovary.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the extent of transmission of hepatitis C virus in sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers and to examine the relation between the prevalences of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections in homosexual men and intravenous drug misusers and their sexual partners. DESIGN--Serum samples collected between 1984 and 1988 were tested for hepatitis B virus markers and antibodies against hepatitis C virus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HIV antibody by enzyme immune analysis and western blotting. SETTING--Large referral university hospital with an external AIDS clinic in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS--243 Intravenous drug misusers, 143 of their regular heterosexual partners, and 105 homosexual men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections. RESULTS--In all, 178 of the 243 (73%) intravenous drug misusers, 16 out of 143 (11%) of their partners, and 17 of the 105 (16%) homosexual men had antibodies against hepatitis C virus. The presence of hepatitis C virus infection was unrelated to sex, age, the presence of HIV or hepatitis B virus infections, or the Centers for Disease Control stage of HIV. In sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers there were strong correlations between the presence of hepatitis C virus infection and that of HIV (p = 0.001) and hepatitis B virus (p = 0.013) infections. CONCLUSIONS--Intravenous drug misusers have a high risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection seems to be unrelated to the presence of the other two viruses. Homosexual men have a high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections with a low prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection, the presence of which is not related to that of the other two infections. Conversely, heterosexual partners of intravenous drug misusers have low prevalences of the three virus infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection correlates significantly with the presence of HIV and hepatitis B infections. The rate of sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus seems to be low, even in partners of people known to be seropositive for this virus.\r"

  ".U": "91070171\r", 
  ".W": "There are numerous institutions worldwide performing clinical trials of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) for cancer. For RIT, an exponentially decaying radionuclide is attached by using a chelating agent to a specific monoclonal or polyclonal tumour antibody (e.g. antiferritin IgG). The major limitation to RIT is toxicity to normal tissue in organs other than the one containing the tumour (e.g. bone marrow). The focus of this manuscript is on modelling the risk (or probability) of hematopoietic death in man for exponentially decaying patterns of high-energy beta irradiation (e.g. 90Y) of bone marrow by radioimmunoglobulin injected into the blood. The analytical solutions presented are only applicable to protocols for which significant uptake of radioactivity by the bone marrow does not occur, and only for high energy beta emitters. However, the generic equation used to obtain the analytical solutions is applicable to any continuous pattern of high energy beta irradiation. A model called the \"normalized dose model\" was used to generate calculated values for the LD50 as a function of the effective half-time for the radioimmunoglobulin in the blood. A less complicated empirical model was used to describe the calculated values. This model is presumed to be valid for effective half-times in blood of up to about 20 days. For longer effective half-times, the LD50 can be estimated using the normalized-dose model presented. In this manuscript, we also provide a modified Weibull model that allows estimation of the risk of hematopoietic death for single or multiple injections (in one cycle) of radioimmunoglobulin, for patients with normal susceptibility to irradiation and for patients with heightened susceptibility. With the modified Weibull model, the risk of hematopoietic death depends on the level of medical treatment provided to mitigate radiation injuries.\r"

Thirty patients (15 aged less than 45 years, 15 aged greater than or equal to 45 years; range 28-54 years) underwent mastectomy/lumpectomy with axillary clearance (with or without local irradiation) followed by ovarian irradiation and prednisolone therapy (2.5 mg three times daily for 5 years). Patients were reviewed every 3 months for the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up was between 1.5 and 10 years (median 5 years). Twenty-four patients are still alive. Three patients stopped therapy because of side-effects. There was a mean(s.e.m.) weight gain of 8.46(1.69) per cent on therapy. Nineteen patients have been weaned off prednisolone over a period of 0.5-7.5 months (median 2 months) and the median length of time off steroids is now 3 years (range 0.5-5 years). This regimen appears to be associated with an acceptable level of patient tolerability and a low chronic morbidity rate and should be considered as an alternative to adjuvant systemic cytotoxic therapy.\r"

Following a single IV bolus of sufentanil 2 micrograms.kg-1 multiple arterial samples were obtained at timed intervals and plasma concentrations of sufentanil were measured by radioimmunoassay. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated from the derived compartmental models. The initial volume of distribution was significantly smaller in the elderly patients (310 +/- 109 ml.kg-1 vs 491 +/- 112 ml.kg-1 mean +/- SD). Elimination half-lives, plasma clearances, and total volumes of distribution were similar for elderly and younger subjects. Six of seven elderly patients required administration of naloxone at the termination of surgery to achieve an adequate rate of ventilation (greater than eight breaths.min-1) while only one younger patient required antagonism of ventilatory depression. The authors believe that age-related differences in the action of sufentanil cannot be accounted for by the observed differences in the initial volume of distribution. It is concluded that alterations in pharmacodynamics appear to be of greater importance in the prolonged opioid effect seen in the elderly.\r"

Sufentanil alone resulted in a increase of norepinephrine (NE) concentration from 108 +/- 73 pg.ml-1 to 843 +/- 399 pg.ml-1 and epinephrine (E) from 279 +/- 80 pg.ml-1 to 2010 +/- 1416 pg.ml-1. At least one week later, an epidural block to T1 was achieved using 8-10 ml, two per cent lidocaine. Plasma NE and E decreased after EA to about 50 per cent of resting baseline measurements. The addition of sufentanil increased NE and E levels to reach approximately the resting base-line levels. In all dogs intravenous sufentanil resulted in bradypnoea, bradycardia, hypoxaemia, and hypercarbia. Intravenous lidocaine infusions had no significant effect on plasma catecholamine levels when plasma lidocaine levels ranged from 1.7 micrograms.ml-1 to 5.3 micrograms.ml-1. We conclude that a high two per cent lidocaine epidural block attenuates the catecholamine response to hypoventilation in dogs, but the persistence of baseline plasma levels of NE and E suggests that the efferent sympathetic block by high EA is incomplete.\r"

The central chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide mediated by the central chemoreceptors, is modelled as a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide. The peripheral chemoreflex, the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and hypoxia mediated by the peripheral chemoreceptors, is broken into two relations. First, a straight-line relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of carbon dioxide whose slope (sensitivity) increases as the oxygen level varies from hyperoxic to hypoxic. Second, a rectangular hyperbolic relation between the ventilatory response and the arterial level of oxygen with ventilation increasing with increasing hypoxia. The three ventilatory response relations (one central and two peripheral) add to produce the total chemoreflex ventilatory response which forms the feedback part of the respiratory regulator. The forward part consists of the relation between the arterial level of carbon dioxide and ventilation when ventilation is controlled (the metabolic hyperbola). The forward and feedback parts of the respiratory regulator can be combined so as to predict resting ventilation and carbon dioxide levels under a number of circumstances. Methods of measurement of these chemoreflex ventilatory responses are also described so as to illustrate the physiological principles involved in the model.\r"

  ".W": "In the present investigation, the reversibility of spermine-induced precocious intestinal maturation was studied. Neonatal rats received either saline or spermine (4 mumol, twice daily) solution orally on the 11th and 12th postnatal day. They were killed on the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th postnatal days. After the small bowel was removed, it was either divided into three equal parts or prepared for electrophoretic analysis. Histological examination, protein content measurement, and disaccharidase activity estimation were performed on each part of the intestine. Spermine administration was shown to induce structural and mucosal enzyme changes characteristic of postnatal maturation. This phenomenon, which was generally clearly observed in 13- and 14-day-old rats, then became less apparent in 15- and 16-day-old animals. Differences were noted according to the segment of intestine or the biochemical parameter analyzed. When rats were 17 days old, no significant differences generally existed between control and spermine-treated rats. If the 140- to 150-kDa proteins, isolated by electrophoresis, are assumed to represent the subunits of the sucrase-isomaltase complex, the results obtained indicate that spermine induces a modification of the concentration of this complex. When compared to values obtained in adult rats, the concentration of the complex was approximately three times higher in spermine-treated 13-day-old rats, while no differences were found in spermine-treated 14-day-old rats. Further, similar concentrations were found in control and spermine-treated rats with an age of 17 days. These results suggest that spermine-induced precocious intestinal maturation is reversible when spermine treatment is stopped.\r"

  ".W": "The presence of unbuffered acid appears to be an essential contributory factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Treatment has concentrated therefore on the reduction of acidity, and the last decade has seen the widespread and effective use of H2 antagonists. They are, at low doses, more successful in improving the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease than of gastric or esophageal ulceration. The H2 receptor plays a central role in activation of parietal cell acid secretion, and antagonists at this receptor block most (but not all) of the acid secretion due to even gastrinergic or muscarinic (vagal) stimulation. In hypergastrinemic states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, or where acid secretion has to be inhibited by more than 20% over a 24-hr period, such as for treatment of esophagitis, NSAID damage, or gastric ulcers, the dose and frequency of administration of the currently available antagonists must be increased to achieve reliable therapy. This has led to a search for an alternative target for acid inhibitory drugs, such as the gastric acid pump, the H+,K(+)-ATPase. This article focuses on the function of this ATPase and suggests that inhibition of this pump will provide a more efficacious means of reduction of acid secretion by the stomach, hence improving and simplifying therapy of acid related diseases.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, 12 intensive care patients, after abdominal surgery, received three alternate six-day courses of two enteral diets with identical nitrogen (0.3 g N/kg per day) and energy (60 kcal/kg per day) supply. The protein hydrolysate (PH) diet contained enzyme-hydrolysed casein and lactoserum (60% small peptides), while the non-degraded protein (NDP) diet contained a nitrogen source of similar amino acid composition, but in the form of non-degraded proteins. The patients were randomised to receive either PH-NDP-PH or NDP-PH-NDP. Parameters reflecting protein metabolism were assessed in the plasma, urine, and stomal effluent on days 1, 6, 12, and 18, three hours after stopping the nutrition (t0), and one hour after restarting it (t1). Comparisons of t1 and t0 values showed that 13 amino acids (including the eight essential amino acids) increased significantly with the protein hydrolysate diet, but only two increased with the non-degraded protein diet. Similarly, with protein hydrolysate, insulin-aemia at t1 was significantly higher than at t0 and correlated with plasma leucine, phenylalanine, alanine, and lysine concentrations. In addition, significant improvements in plasma albumin, transferrin, and retinol binding protein concentrations were seen with protein hydrolysate, together with a significant decrease in the plasma phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio and urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion. We conclude that in patients in intensive care after abdominal surgery enteral support containing small peptides is more effective than an equivalent diet containing whole proteins in restoring plasma amino acid and protein levels.\r"

The strength of fixation and the volume fraction of ingrowth of bone were determined two, four, and eight weeks after the operation in the group that received 1000 centigrays and two and four weeks after the operation in the group that received 500 centigrays. Treatment with 500 centigrays had no significant effect on the strength of fixation or the amount of ingrowth of bone. In contrast, at two weeks, treatment with 1000 centigrays had reduced the strength of fixation to 50 per cent of the control value (p less than 0.01), although, at four and eight weeks, the strength of fixation was not significantly different than that in the control limb. The amount of ingrowth of bone in the irradiated limb was significantly reduced at two weeks (30 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.01), four weeks (70 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05), and eight weeks (56 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05).\r"

The following recombinant cytokines were used: IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, GM-CSF, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Only IFN-gamma induced HLA-DR (but not HLA-DQ) expression. TNF-alpha inhibited IFN-gamma-mediated HLA-DR expression (46.7 +/- 4.1% inhibition) and HLA-DR mRNA accumulation. This inhibitory effect was also observed in osteoarthritis synoviocytes. Only TNF-alpha and IL-1 increased synoviocyte proliferation (stimulation index 3.60 +/- 1.03 and 2.31 +/- 0.46, respectively). IFN-gamma (but none of the other cytokines) inhibited TNF-alpha-induced proliferation (70 +/- 14% inhibition) without affecting the activity of IL-1. Only IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha induced collagenase production (from less than 0.10 U/ml to 1.10 +/- 0.15 and 0.72 +/- 0.24, respectively). IFN-gamma decreased TNF-alpha-mediated collagenase production (69 +/- 19% inhibition) and GM-CSF production but had no effect on the action of IL-1. These data demonstrate mutual antagonism between IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha on fibroblast-like synoviocytes and suggest a novel homeostatic control mechanism that might be defective in RA where very little IFN-gamma is produced.\r"

  ".U": "91072651\r", 
  ".W": "Agonist occupancy of the cloned human serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor expressed in HeLa cells stimulates Na+/K+ ATPase activity as assessed by rubidium uptake. The purpose of the study was to determine which of the receptor-associated signaling mechanisms was responsible for this effect. 5-HT stimulated Na+/K+ ATPase 38% at 2 mM extracellular potassium, an effect characterized by a decrease in apparent K0.5 from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.3 mM potassium without a significant change in apparent Vmax. The EC50 for the transport effect was approximately 3 microM 5-HT. The response was pertussis toxin-sensitive but did not involve inhibition of adenylate cyclase, as stimulation of Na+/K+ ATPase by 5-HT was observed in the presence of excess dibutyryl cAMP. Protein kinase C was not required for the response since short-term incubation with the phorbol esters phorbol 12 myristate, 13 acetate (PMA) and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) did not mimic the 5-HT effect. Moreover, 5-HT increased Na+/K+ ATPase activity after inactivation of protein kinase C by overnight incubation with PMA. 5-HT and the sesquiterpene lactone thapsigargin increased cytosolic calcium in this cell model, and the EC50 for 5-HT corresponded with that for stimulation of Na+/K+ ATPase. Both thapsigargin and A23187, a calcium ionophore, also increased Na+/K+ ATPase activity in a dose-responsive fashion. The response to 5-HT, thapsigargin, and A23187 was blocked by conditions that removed the cytosolic calcium response. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we established evidence for a calcium-sensitive but protein kinase C-independent signaling pathway. We conclude that the 5-HT1A receptor, which we have previously shown to stimulate phosphate uptake via protein kinase C, stimulates Na+/K+ ATPase via a calcium-dependent mechanism. This provides evidence for regulation of two separate transport processes by a single receptor subtype via different signaling mechanisms.\r"

Proteins studied were human T4-binding globulin (TBG), human T4-binding prealbumin (TBPA), human albumin, rat TBPA, and human albumin isolated from subjects with familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia. For each of the five protein-hormone complexes studied, the rate of hepatic uptake of T4 (measured under conditions expected to result in dissociation-limited uptake) closely approximated the rate of spontaneous dissociation of the protein-hormone complex within the hepatic sinusoids. These findings indicate an absence of special cellular mechanisms that facilitate the hepatic uptake of T4 from its plasma binding proteins, and support the view that uptake occurs from the free T4 pool after spontaneous dissociation of T4 from its binding proteins.\r"

  ".U": "91072663\r", 
  ".W": "Studies using cultured cells have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) induces the expression of Fc gamma RI (the type I Fc receptor for IgG) on human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and greatly increases the number of these receptors on human monocytes. Administration of rIFN-gamma in vivo also causes enhanced Fc gamma RI expression on these cell populations. Because streptococcal antigens are potent inducers of IFN-gamma in vitro, we postulated that IFN-gamma would be produced endogenously in vivo in patients with streptococcal infections. Such production of IFN-gamma in vivo, even at low levels, might be expected to induce the expression of Fc gamma RI on monocytes and neutrophils. To evaluate this possibility, we used monoclonal antibody 32 (mAb 32), which is specific for Fc gamma RI, to quantitate the expression of this receptor on human peripheral blood cells. We measured the binding of mAb 32 to monocytes and PMNs isolated from healthy donors and from patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. PMNs from healthy donors (n = 12) had 700 +/- 600 (mean +/- SD) mAb 32 binding sites. Patients with pharyngitis and negative throat culture for GABHS (n = 11) had 2,100 +/- 1,600 sites on their PMNs. In contrast, the PMNs from patients with documented GABHS pharyngitis (n = 12) had 11,600 +/- 7,500 mAb 32 binding sites on their surface. There was a similar change in the expression of Fc gamma RI on monocytes, with control monocytes having a mean of 19,900 +/- 3,200 mAb 32 binding sites per cell and the GABHS-positive monocytes having 47,500 +/- 21,400 sites. The GABHS-negative throat culture group had a slightly elevated number of Fc gamma RI with a mean of 28,200 +/- 8,400 sites. 10 patients with documented urinary tract infections and three patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis had no elevation in Fc gamma RI expression. These studies demonstrate that a localized group A streptococcal infection can cause systemic activation of the entire circulating pool of phagocytes, and suggest that a similar level of activation is uncommon in localized gram-negative infections of the urinary tract.\r"

Loss of surface membrane ruffling and the capacity of [Tyr4]-bombesin, vasopressin, and fetal calf serum to stimulate increases in intracellular free calcium clearly preceded effects on cellular metabolic activity and cell growth. 125I-[Tyr4]-bombesin binding was unaffected by CT treatment but [Tyr4]-bombesin stimulated phospholipase C activity was decreased in membranes from CT-treated SCLC cells. CT stimulated a rapid but transient increase in intracellular cyclic AMP ([cAMP]i) in SCLC. The effects of CT on susceptible SCLC were not reproduced by elevations of [cAMP]i induced by forskolin or cyclic AMP analogues. GM1 ganglioside, the cellular binding site for CT, was highly expressed in the CT-sensitive but not the CT-resistant SCLC cell lines. In contrast, expression of guanine nucleotide binding protein substrates for ADP-ribosylation by CT was similar. These data demonstrate the existence of a CT-sensitive growth inhibitory pathway in SCLC-bearing GM1 ganglioside. Addition of CT results in decreased responsiveness to several mitogenic stimuli. These results suggest novel therapeutic approaches to human SCLC.\r"

The effect of TNF alpha on SP-A content and mRNA in the pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, H441-4, was concentration and time dependent. TNF alpha decreased the cellular content of SP-A to less than 10% of control 48 h after addition. TNF alpha decreased de novo synthesis of SP-A and decreased the accumulation of SP-A in media. SP-A mRNA was decreased within 12 h of addition of TNF alpha, with nearly complete loss of SP-A mRNA observed after 24 h. Inhibitory effects of TNF alpha on SP-A mRNA were dose-related with nearly complete inhibition of SP-A mRNA caused by 25 ng/ml TNF alpha. The effects of TNF alpha on SP-A were distinct from the effects of interferon gamma which increased SP-A content approximately twofold in H441-4 cells. TNF alpha also decreased the content of SP-B mRNA. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of TNF alpha on SP-A and SP-B mRNA, TNF alpha increased mRNA encoding human manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). TNF alpha did not inhibit growth, alter cell viability or beta-actin mRNA in either cell line. These in vitro studies demonstrate the marked pretranslational inhibitory effects of the cytokine, TNF alpha, on the expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-B. The results support the concept that macrophage-derived cytokines may control surfactant protein expression.\r"

The DNA was digested with Pst I, electrophoresed, and transferred to membranes by the Southern blot method. The blots were probed with a cDNA probe for the alpha chain of the T cell receptor. 13 polymorphic RFLP patterns were recognized. 1.3- and 3.0-kb band pairs were observed in 15 of 31 of American Caucasian patients and 4 of 34 American Caucasian controls (chi square, 8.81; P less than 0.002; relative risk, 7); there was no association of any RFLP pattern with Mexican SLE. The cDNA probe was cut with Rsa I, EcoR I, and Ava II into fragments corresponding to the V, J, C, and 3'UT regions. Only the fragment corresponding to the constant region reacted with the 1.3/3.0-kb band pair. These observations suggest that a genetic marker of the constant region of the alpha chain of the T cell receptor is associated with genes involved in SLE.\r"

  ".U": "91072675\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) content of the anterior hypothalamic region of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) is higher than that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. ANP has been shown to inhibit neuronal norepinephrine release and to reduce the excitability of hypothalamic neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that blockade of endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus by local microinjection of a monoclonal antibody to ANP (MAb KY-ANP-II) lowers blood pressure in SHR-S. Purified MAb KY-ANP-II (0.055 and 0.55 micrograms) or control mouse IgG in 200 nl saline was microinjected into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) of conscious SHR-S and control WKY rats. As a further control, Mab KY-ANP-II (0.55 microgram) was microinjected into the posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) of SHR-S. Anterior hypothalamic microinjection of MAb KY-ANP-II caused significant dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in SHR-S but not in WKY rats. Control injections of equal volumes of IgG had no effect on MAP or HR. Microinjection of Mab KY-ANP-II into PHA produced no significant alteration in MAP or HR in SHR-S. These data provide the first demonstration that endogenous ANP in a region of brain known to influence cardiovascular function mediates BP and HR control in the rat. These findings suggest that the increased endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus of SHR-S may be involved in the central regulation of BP in the model.\r"

  ".W": "In hepatic iron overload, iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the mechanisms of hepatocellular injury. Lipid peroxidation may produce reactive aldehydes such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which may form aldehyde-protein adducts. We investigated whether lipid peroxidation occurred in rats fed a diet containing 3% carbonyl iron for 5-13 wk, and if this resulted in the formation of MDA- and 4-HNE- protein adducts. Chronic iron feeding resulted in hepatic iron overload (greater than 10-fold) and concomitantly induced a 2-fold increase in hepatic lipid peroxidation. Using an antiserum specific for MDA-lysine protein adducts, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry the presence of aldehyde-protein adducts in the cytosol of periportal hepatocytes, which co-localized with iron. In addition, MDA- and 4-HNE-lysine adducts were found in plasma proteins of animals with iron overload. Only MDA adducts were detected in albumin, while other plasma proteins including a approximately 120-kD protein had both MDA and 4-HNE adducts. In this animal model of hepatic iron overload, injury occurs primarily in periportal hepatocytes, where MDA-lysine protein adducts and excess iron co-localized.\r"

  ".W": "The diminished ability of insulin to promote glucose disposal and storage in muscle has been ascribed to impaired activation of glycogen synthase (GS). It is possible that decreased glucose storage could occur as a consequence of decreased glucose uptake, and that GS is impaired secondarily. Muscle glucose uptake in 15 diabetic subjects was matched to 15 nondiabetic subjects by maintaining fasting hyperglycemia during infusion of insulin. Leg muscle glucose uptake, glucose oxidation (local indirect calorimetry), release of glycolytic products, and muscle glucose storage, as well as muscle GS and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were determined before and during insulin infusion. Basal leg glucose oxidation and PDH were increased in the diabetics. Insulin-stimulated leg glucose uptake in the diabetics (8.05 +/- 1.41 mumol/[min.100 ml leg tissue]) did not differ from controls (5.64 +/- 0.37). Insulin-stimulated leg glucose oxidation, nonoxidized glycolysis, and glucose storage (2.48 +/- 0.27, 0.68 +/- 0.15, and 5.04 +/- 1.34 mumol/[min.100 ml], respectively) were not different from controls (2.18 +/- 0.12, 0.62 +/- 0.16, and 2.83 +/- 0.31). PDH and GS in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were also normal during insulin infusion. When diabetics were restudied after being rendered euglycemic by overnight insulin infusion, GS and PDH were reduced compared with hyperglycemia. Thus, fasting hyperglycemia is sufficient to normalize insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake in NIDDM, and glucose is distributed normally to glycogenesis and glucose oxidation, possibly by normalization of GS and PDH.\r"

  ".W": "Extracorporeal photochemotherapy is an effective treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma but its mode of action is uncertain. The reduction in viability of patients' photoirradiated buffy coat lymphocytes was correlated with a 35% increase in DNA single-strand breaks and marked decreases in cellular ATP and NAD levels (to 58 and 34% of control, respectively) immediately after photoirradiation. Complementary in vitro studies were conducted with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes using a Therakos ultraviolet A (UVA) light box. UVA light was cytotoxic on its own but was potentiated by 8-methoxysporalen. 3-aminobenzamide, a poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor, mitigated the cytotoxic effect of ultraviolet A light in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen in lymphocytes and reduced the amount of nucleotide depletion they caused. 10 J/cm2 of UVA light in the presence of 300 ng/ml 8-methoxypsoralen increased the poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Exposing lymphocytes to deoxycoformycin and deoxyadenosine was found to induce biochemical and physical effects similar to those of photochemotherapy. In summary, we have shown that the lymphocytotoxic effect of extracorporeal photochemotherapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma is apparently mediated by DNA damage, subsequent poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation and adenine nucleotide depletion. It is not known how the DNA damage and resultant biochemical effects relate to the possible immunological mechanism of extracorporeal photochemotherapy; however, it is possible that its effects can be mimicked by other DNA-damaging agents.\r"

  ".U": "91072693\r", 
  ".W": "To provide a sensitive and generally applicable method to detect clonal cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we have designed a new strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the T cell receptor gamma delta gene rearrangements found in most T and B lineage ALLs. PCR allows rapid sequencing of variable-(diversity)-joining (V-[D]-J) junctions from tumor DNA and construction of anti-junctional oligonucleotides (AJOs) used as probes to detect clonal cells in the same patient. We have defined oligonucleotides suitable for all T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements involving functional V gamma segments. Oligonucleotides corresponding to preferential TCR delta rearrangements in T and B lineage ALLs were also used. By analysis of the nucleotide sequence of 52 V gamma-V gamma junctions from 30 cases of B and T ALLs, we demonstrate that V-J junctional sequences are clone specific in both lineages and at all stages of differentiation examined despite the frequent presence of the recently described P nucleotides. Experiments performed with TCR gamma delta AJOs on DNA from tumor cells and polyclonal T cells show that AJOs can be used to differentiate clonal cells from polyclonal T cells, distinguish between different T cell clones, and detect residual clonal populations at 10(-4)/10(-5) dilution. AJOs were also used to detect residual disease in samples from patients in clinical and morphological complete remission. Finally, rearrangement patterns were studied by classical Southern analysis in selected cases at both presentation and subsequent relapse showing absence of clonal evolution in most cases. V-(D)-J nucleotide sequences of rearrangements with an identical pattern of rearrangement at presentation and relapse were identical in all cases analyzed. We therefore describe a new, specific, and clinically useful strategy for the detection of minor clonal populations applicable in the majority of cases of ALL.\r"

S-100 protein, peanut agglutinin, and the antibody Mac-387 were used as markers for histiocytes. The frequency of Birbeck granule-containing cells in seven histiocytosis X lesions did not correspond with the number of S-100+ or peanut agglutinin+ cells. All neoplastic histiocytosis X cells were positive for S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin but were negative for Mac-387. Histiocytes of juvenile xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, and traumatic granuloma were strongly positive for Mac-387 but were negative for S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin, except for the peanut agglutinin-reactive Touton giant cells. Mac-387 reliably differentiates histiocytic proliferations of the monocyte/macrophage system from those of the dendritic cell system. For the diagnosis of histiocytosis X, both S-100 protein and peanut agglutinin positivity in histiocytes is as reliable as ultrastructural demonstration of Birbeck granules.\r"

  ".W": "In the conservative strategy arm of phase II of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial, 1,461 patients were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Coronary angiography, with angioplasty if feasible, was to be performed only for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia. In this study results in patients treated by this strategy in community and tertiary hospitals are compared. Despite similar baseline findings in the two groups, coronary angiography was performed within 42 days in more patients (542 [48%] of 1,155) initially admitted to a tertiary hospital (on-site coronary angiography/angioplasty available) than in those (94 [32%] of 306) admitted to a community hospital (transfer to tertiary hospital for coronary angiography/angioplasty) (p less than 0.001). This different approach resulted in a greater use of coronary angioplasty (203 [18%] of 1,155 versus 32 [11%] of 306, p less than 0.01), coronary artery bypass surgery (133 [12%] of 1,155 versus 23 [8%] of 306, p less than 0.05) and blood transfusions (139 [12%] of 1,155 versus 17 [5.5%] of 306, p less than 0.001) in patients admitted to a tertiary than to a community hospital. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction or left ventricular function. These results demonstrate that a conservative strategy after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with rt-PA is applicable in the community hospital setting.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of associated precordial ST segment depression in inferior myocardial infarction on angiographic and clinical outcomes after thrombolytic therapy and selective coronary angioplasty was studied in 583 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Anterior infarction (Group I), inferior infarction with precordial ST segment depression (Group II) and inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group III) were present in 289, 135 and 159 patients, respectively. Precordial ST segment depression was more frequent in circumflex than right coronary infarct-related arteries (44 [71%] of 62 versus 91 [40%] of 230; p = 0.000). Although acute patency rates were not statistically different, there was a trend toward different patency rates at day 7 (Group I 88%, Group II 84%, Group III 80%; p = 0.089) partly because of insignificantly higher reocclusion rates in inferior infarction without precordial ST segment depression (Group I 11%, Group II 10%, Group III 18%, p = 0.104). Infarct zone regional wall motion (standard deviations/chord) in inferior infarction was lower with precordial ST segment depression, both acutely (Group I -2.8 +/- 0.9, Group II -2.5 +/- 1.2, Group III 2.0 +/- 1.1; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I -2.2 +/- 1.1, Group II -2.3 +/- 1.1, Group III -1.9 +/- 1.3; p = 0.011). Precordial ST segment depression was associated with a lower ejection fraction in inferior infarction both acutely (Group I 47 +/- 11%, Group II 53 +/- 11%, Group III 58 +/- 9%; p = 0.000) and at day 7 (Group I 49 +/- 12%, Group II 53 +/- 10%, Group III 58 +/- 8%; p = 0.000). Complication rates tended to be higher in inferior infarction when precordial ST segment depression was present. Mortality rates for Groups I, II and III were 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively. These results suggest that precordial ST segment depression in inferior infarction predicts a worse ventriculographic and clinical outcome despite reperfusion therapy.\r"

Heparin and aspirin were given to both groups until angiography was performed. Digital subtracted images of the infarct-related coronary vessel were obtained 10 to 14 days after hospital admission and were subsequently analyzed with the use of a computer-assisted coronary stenosis measurement system. Neither treatment group differed significantly in age, gender or location of the culprit coronary lesion. Median values (90% range) in the thrombolysis and control groups were, respectively, 1.95 (0.9 to 5.3) mm versus 1.7 (0.9 to 3.4) mm for stenosis length; 1.4 (0.8 to 2.7) mm versus 1.4 (0.9 to 1.8) mm for minimal luminal diameter; 57% (36% to 75%) versus 58% (44% to 71%) for diameter obstruction; 82% (59% to 95%) versus 82% (68% to 92%) for geometric area obstruction; and 78% (58% to 91%) versus 79% (66% to 90%) for densitometric area obstruction. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for any of these measurements. Thus, in this study no significant differences in anatomy or severity of residual coronary stenosis could be demonstrated at 10 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with a recanalized infarct-related vessel, whether or not thrombolytic therapy was given on admission. These results indicate that with effective antithrombotic treatment, gradual endogenous fibrinolysis or more rapid lysis induced by the infusion of a thrombolytic agent results in a similar infarct-related coronary lesion at the time of hospital discharge.\r"

Coronary angiography was performed before and 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings and 4 h plasma creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK MB) were performed over the first 24 h. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, von Willebrand factor and C-reactive protein were measured before rt-PA infusion, daily for the first 3 days and after 90 days. In the entire group, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity peaked at 24 h (day 1), representing a significant increase over values at all other times (p = 0.03). von Willebrand factor was higher in the first 2 days of infarction compared with after 90 days (p = 0.001). C-reactive protein peaked on day 2, with an eightfold increase over values on admission (p = 0.001). In the 16 patients with a patent infarct-related artery at 90 min, infarct size estimated by integrated 24 h CK MB, time for ST segment elevation to decrease to half-maximum and peak C-reactive protein were reduced significantly by more than twofold compared with values in the 8 patients with an occluded artery at 90 min. The patients with early recanalization also had lower plasminogen activator inhibitor activity on day 2 (p = 0.05) and day 3 (p = 0.02) and lower 0 to 72 h averaged von Willebrand factor (p = 0.01). Thus, early coronary recanalization curtails the response of plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and von Willebrand factor to myocardial infarction, most likely by reducing the extent of ischemia and necrosis and the consequent acute phase reaction. By blunting the early postinfarction procoagulant state, prompt recanalization may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications in the first days after myocardial infarction.\r"

Of these, 10 admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 h from the onset of symptoms were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (Group A) and 24 admitted between 4 and 8 h after onset were randomly assigned to receive either rt-PA (Group B, n = 12) or conventional therapy (Group C, n = 12). Seven to 10 days after admission, all patients underwent cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Patency of the infarct-related vessel was 70% in Group A, 66% in Group B and 33% in Group C and the average Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) coronary perfusion grade was 1.9 +/- 0.8 for Group A, 1.6 +/- 1.0 for Group B and 0.84 +/- 0.95 for Group C (Group A versus Group C p less than 0.01; Group B versus Group C p less than 0.05). At predischarge evaluation, mean left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for both); mean left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Group B and Group A (p less than 0.05 for both). At 1 year follow-up study, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes remained higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.05 for both) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for end-systolic volume and p less than 0.001 for end-diastolic volume); ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Groups A and B (p less than 0.05 for both); during exercise, it increased more in Group A than in Group C (p less than 0.01). Comparison of data obtained before discharge and at the 1 year follow-up study revealed a significant differences in end-systolic volume (p less than 0.05) in Group C patients and in end-diastolic volume in patients in Groups B (p less than 0.05) and C (p less than 0.001). The beneficial effect of late thrombolysis with rt-PA may be related to a reduction in myocardial expansion and thus to a favorable influence on postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.\r"

In 17 patients with ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function and in 8 patients with restrictive heart disease and preserved systolic function, the presence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in tissue obtained by ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. The objective of the study was to determine if the ventricular presence of atrial natriuretic factor is dependent on ventricular dilation. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was greater in the group with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the group with restrictive cardiomyopathy (134 +/- 13 versus 78 +/- 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.05); end-diastolic pressure was elevated in the two groups (20 +/- 2 versus 25 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS). With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was clearly detected in 15 of the 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 of the 8 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor in living patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Whereas in the atria, stretch or dilation may be an important stimulus, atrial natriuretic factor in the ventricular chamber occurs independent of dilation.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitation of perfusion defect size using tomographic imaging with technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile was performed at the time of hospital discharge in 32 patients with a first myocardial infarction who underwent successful coronary reperfusion within 8 h of the onset of chest pain. Reperfusion was accomplished with thrombolysis or primary coronary angioplasty. Radionuclide angiography was performed at discharge and 6 weeks later. There was a close correlation between perfusion defect size and values for ejection fraction and regional wall motion both at discharge (r = -0.80 and -0.75, respectively) and 6 weeks later (r = -0.81 and -0.81, respectively). There was no overall group difference in ejection fraction between the value at discharge and at 6 weeks; however, five patients had a significant increase (greater than or equal to 0.08) and six had a significant decrease (greater than or equal to 0.08) in ejection fraction. In patients with a significant increase at 6 weeks, ejection fraction was significantly lower at discharge than the value predicted from perfusion defect size (0.37 +/- 0.09 measured versus 0.47 +/- 0.13 predicted, p less than 0.05) and it improved at 6 weeks to near predicted values (0.51 +/- 0.07). In patients with a significant decrease at 6 weeks, ejection fraction was significantly higher at discharge than the value predicted from perfusion defect size (0.60 +/- 0.10 measured versus 0.50 +/- 0.10 predicted, p less than 0.05) and it decreased at 6 weeks to near predicted levels (0.51 +/- 0.09). Left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of hospital discharge is a potentially misleading index of the efficacy of reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction. In a significant minority (34%) of patients this index does not accurately reflect perfusion defect size, apparently because of the effects of myocardial stunning and compensatory hyperkinesia.\r"

Seventeen patients underwent electrophysiologic study before and after oral flecainide administration and after the addition of isoproterenol to flecainide. No patient had inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia after flecainide alone. Two patients had inducible sustained and six had inducible nonsustained tachycardia after isoproterenol was added to flecainide. The patients were then followed up on the same flecainide dose they received at the time of the electrophysiologic study. Findings: 1) Flecainide treatment prolonged HV and VA intervals, and the addition of isoproterenol did not affect these variables. 2) Isoproterenol shortened anterograde and retrograde block cycle length and the refractory period of the accessory pathway and the AV node. It also decreased the tachycardia cycle length, an effect that was due solely to shortening of AV node conduction time. 3) Flecainide treatment prevented tachycardia induction by affecting retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. Isoproterenol allowed for tachycardia induction and for more sustained episodes of tachycardia by reversing the effect of flecainide on retrograde accessory pathway conduction. 4) Tachycardia recurred during follow-up in all three patients in whom tachycardia of greater than or equal to 10 s duration was induced after isoproterenol but in no patient who had no or shorter episodes of induced tachycardia (and who did not have a change in medical regimen). Conclusions: 1) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prolongation of block cycle length and refractory periods of the accessory pathway and AV node. 2) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prevention of tachycardia induction through reversal of the effects of flecainide on the retrograde accessory pathway. 3) The addition of isoproterenol during flecainide restudy is valuable in predicting long-term drug efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "In a single-blind randomized study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone (2 mg/kg body weight per 10 min) versus flecainide (2 mg/kg per 10 min) were assessed in 50 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 h. Conversion to sinus was achieved in 11 (55%) of 20 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with propafenone and in 18 (90%) of 20 with atrial fibrillation treated with flecainide (p less than 0.02). If atrial fibrillation was present less than or equal to 24 h, conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 8 (57%) of 14 patients in the propafenone group and 13 (93%) of 14 in the flecainide group (p less than 0.05). Atrial flutter was converted in two (40%) of five patients treated with propafenone and in one (20%) of five with flecainide (p = NS). Mean time to conversion was 16 +/- 10 min in the propafenone group versus 18 +/- 13 min in the flecainide group (p = NS). QRS lengthening (83 +/- 15 to 99 +/- 20 ms) was observed only in the patients treated with flecainide (p less than 0.001). Patients successfully treated with propafenone showed significantly higher plasma levels than those whose arrhythmia did not convert to sinus rhythm. Transient adverse effects were more frequent in the flecainide group (40%) than in the propafenone group (8%) (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10 min, flecainide is more effective than propafenone for conversion of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. However, considering the propafenone plasma levels and very few adverse effects, the dose or infusion rate, or both, used in the propafenone group may not have been sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Neither drug seems very effective in patients with atrial flutter.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance of coronary occlusive thrombus to thrombolytic therapy, found in some patients with acute myocardial infarction, may be due to the presence of platelet-rich coronary clot. Reperfusion therapy in such patients may require the development and evaluation of alternative strategies in animal models. Therefore, platelet-rich coronary artery thrombus was developed by excision, eversion (inside out) and reanastomosis of a 1 cm segment of the left circumflex coronary artery in anesthetized dogs maintained on heparin antiocoagulation. Blood flow was restored in 25 of 27 dogs. Thrombotic occlusion of the everted segment graft with primarily platelet-rich thrombus or thrombus containing platelet-rich and erythrocyte-rich zones, persisting for at least 30 min, occurred within 4.5 +/- 3.5 min (mean +/- SD) in 20 of these 25 dogs. In 5 of these 20 dogs (group I, control), stable occlusion, as monitored with an ultrasound flow probe and coronary angiography, was maintained during a 2 h observation period. In group II (n = 5), intravenous bolus injections of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a dose of 0.45 mg/kg body weight at four 15 min intervals did not cause reperfusion in four dogs and produced cyclic reperfusion and reocclusion in one dog. In group III (n = 5), a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.8 mg/kg of the F(ab')2 fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody (7E3) against the human platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor [7E3-F(ab')2] produced stable reperfusion in two of the five dogs, whereas occlusion persisted in the other three. In group IV (n = 5), injection of 7E3-F(ab')2 (0.8 mg/kg) followed by rt-PA (0.45 mg/kg) caused stable reperfusion without reocclusion in all dogs (p less than 0.05 versus rt-PA alone and p less than 0.01 versus control). This study confirms that platelet-rich occlusive coronary thrombus is very resistant to lysis with intravenous rt-PA. However, this resistance may be overcome by the combined use of a reduced dose of rt-PA and the antiplatelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antibody 7E3. The results indicate that platelet-rich thrombus resistant to thrombolytic agents may be dispersed pharmacologically without resort to mechanical recanalization. The present dog model may be useful in investigating specific strategies for the dispersion of resistant platelet-rich coronary thrombus.\r"

Seventy-one patients over the age of 74 admitted to the medical service of Stanford University Hospital between February and May 1987 received functional assessments covering seven domains: mobility, transfer, toileting, incontinence, feeding, grooming, and mental status. Assessments were obtained by report from the patient's caregiver (or the patient when he or she lived alone) for 2 weeks before admission; from the patient's nurse on day 2 of hospitalization and on the day before discharge; and again from the caregiver (or patient) 1 week after discharge. The sample had a mean age of 84, covered 37 Diagnostic Related Groups, and had a median length of stay of 8 days. Between baseline and day 2, statistically significant deteriorations occurred for the overall functional score and for the individual scores for mobility, transfer, toileting, feeding, and grooming. None of these scores improved significantly by discharge. In the case of mobility, 65% of the patients experienced a decline in score between baseline and day 2. Between day 2 and discharge, 67% showed no improvement, and another 10% deteriorated further. These data suggest that older patients may experience a burden of new and worsened functional impairment during hospitalization that improves at a much slower rate than the acute illness. An awareness of delayed functional recovery should influence discharge planning for older patients. Greater efforts to prevent functional decline in the hospitalized older patient may be warranted.\r"

There was no significant difference between FSH and LH. The effect of FSH was neutralized by FSH antiserum, while that of LH was not, indicating that the stimulation of maturation by LH was not due to FSH contamination in the LH preparation. When LH was added after 2 hr of culture with FSH (sequential combination), blastocyst development was significantly increased compared with FSH alone, reaching the same level as the in vivo matured oocytes. The addition of estradiol, 0.1 ng/ml, to the sequential combination of FSH and LH had no effect, while 0.01 and 1 ng/ml produced a negative effect. The birth rate of normal live offspring following embryo transfer showed no significant difference between embryos derived from oocytes matured in vivo and in vitro (sequential combination with or without 0.1 ng/ml estradiol) or between the two in vitro treatment groups.\r"

In 21 of the 24 patients, the disease resembled the primary idiopathic variety with clear lung fields and no clinical evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, although angiography and nuclear perfusion scans were not performed. Two patients clearly suffered from thromboembolic PHT, one with SLE and one with an antiphospholipid syndrome. One patient with SLE/PSS overlap syndrome developed pulmonary fibrosis. The frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin was 68% which appears to be higher than generally found in patients with SLE, and the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Other associated features of the antiphospholipid syndrome in this group were uncommon. Death occurred in 13 of the 24 patients, 4 were lost to followup and 7 are known to be alive. The cause of death was circulatory failure in the majority; sudden death once this complication occurred was particularly common. One patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome and one from hemorrhagic shock while undergoing heart/lung transplantation. Two patients underwent successful heart/lung transplantation. One, however, died of a mesenteric occlusion and bowel infarction following a second lung transplantation because of rejection of the first heart/lung transplantation after one year. The other patient is alive and well 2 years later.\r"

The binding of MSUM crystals to pretreated erythrocyte membranes was also quantitated. Neuraminidase treated cells gave higher percent hemolysis values than untreated cells due primarily to the increased binding of MSUM to neuraminidase treated erythrocyte membranes. Pretreatment of red cells with glutaraldehyde up to a maximum concentration of 0.015% inhibited MSUM induced hemolysis but the binding of MSUM to glutaraldehyde treated and untreated cell membranes was the same. We propose a \"pore\" model for MSUM induced hemolysis.\r"

The mechanisms underlying such amplification processes are presumed to be generated by loss of intestinal barrier function. The resulting host exposure to toxins is hypothesized to induce regional production of inflammatory mediators which serve to alter organ-specific and systemic responses. The cytokine class of mediators appears capable of altering splanchnic tissue function in a manner consistent with observed clinical responses. The breadth of tissue activity influenced by the cytokines spans those benefitting tissue homeostasis and repair to an exaggerated response which may induce tissue injury and organ failure. Data are presented from both clinical and experimental studies to suggest that a lack of intestinal nutrient provision, such as that induced by parenteral feeding, appears to predispose to enhanced cytokine mediator production in hepatic tissues. Thus alterations in the route of antecedent feeding may influence immunologic and metabolic function in a manner which will amplify responses to a subsequent inflammatory challenge.\r"

Activation of transport occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation (fourfold) occurring approximately 15 hours after exposure to 2.5 nM TNF. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, blunted TNF-induced 2-deoxyglucose uptake, suggesting that new synthesis was in part responsible for the observed increase. Increased hexose transport occurred concomitant with a 50% increase in general protein synthesis which preceded a fivefold stimulation of thymidine incorporation into DNA. Elevated hexose transport preceded an accumulation of glucose transporter (GLUT-1) mRNA. We have further demonstrated that the early accumulation of GLUT-1 mRNA is accompanied by accumulation of mRNA for both the prootooncogene c-fos as well as that for beta-actin. We suggest that these events represent the pleiotrophic growth factor-like properties of TNF-alpha.\r"

By counteracting the effects of the hormones, atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) regulates the renal response to burns. ANP was elevated after burns, protecting the kidneys by increasing renal blood flow and urine output. In pulmonary acid injury, increased ANP levels were associated with natriuresis which was reduced by administration of anti-ANP serum. Exogenous ANP given to dogs under constant norepinephrine infusion resulted in improvement of hemodynamic and renal parameters. To prevent tubular damage due to hemoglobinuria, a haptoglobin preparation is administered to patients with extensive third-degree burns. With sufficient fluid replacement, these new treatments will reduce the incidence of acute renal failure in the early postburn period.\r"

Over-all, 57 patients (92 ureters) were treated. The majority of ureters (68.5%) had grade II to III/V vesicoureteral reflux (international classification). One treatment was given in 61.4% of the patients, while 33.3% required 2 and 5.3% required 3 treatments. Nonduplicated/primarily refluxing ureters comprised 68.5% of the total, while 13% were duplex/primarily refluxing and 18.5% were surgical failures. The procedures were performed on an outpatient basis in all but 3 patients. Patients were evaluated by voiding cystourethrogram and renal/bladder sonography before and after treatment at 1 month and 1 year. Cure at 1 month after the last treatment was achieved in 75% of the ureters. Among the ureters cured at 1 month the cure persisted in 79% at 1 year after treatment. Cure at 1 year was achieved in 65% of all ureters evaluated, regardless of the status at 1 month. Procedure-related morbidity was minimal and there were no adverse reactions to the implant substance. Thus, glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine dermal collagen appears to be safe and effective in the endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux.\r"

Of the samples from 20 patients with transitional cell carcinoma, 14 (70%) were successfully cultured and had a mean LI of 32%. In addition, one specimen from a patient with squamous cell carcinoma was cultured and had a LI of 61%. Cultured samples were tested for chemosensitivity using a two hour exposure of mitomycin C in concentrations ranging from one to 50 micrograms./ml. A dose-dependent relationship was demonstrated; LI decreased as mitomycin C concentrations increased. The methodology described provides an alternative to suspension or monolayer techniques of culturing human bladder tumors for pharmacological studies.\r"

  ".W": "Some investigators have suggested that information on quality of care in intensive-care units (ICUs) may be inferred from mortality rates. Specifically, the ratio of actual to predicted hospital mortality (A/P) has been proposed as a valid measure for comparing ICU outcomes when predicted mortality has been derived from data collected during the first 24 hours of ICU therapy with use of a severity scoring tool, APACHE II (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation). We present a comparison of mortality ratios (A/P) in four ICUs under common management, in two hospitals within a single institution. Significant differences in A/P were detected for nonoperative patients (0.99 versus 0.67;P = 0.014) between the two hospitals. This variation was traced to uneven representation of a subset of patients who had chronic health problems related to diseases that necessitated admission to the hematology-oncology or hepatology service. No differences in A/P were seen between the two hospitals for operative patients or for nonoperative patients on services other than hematology-oncology or hepatology. Thus, differences in A/P detected by using the APACHE II system not only may reside in operational factors within the ICU organization but also may be related to weaknesses in the APACHE II model to measure factors intrinsic to the disease process in some patients. We suggest that case-mix must be examined in detail before concluding that differences in A/P are caused by differences in quality of care.\r"

The financial burden for these patients includes the cost of medical care and often the loss of employment. Psychosocial deterioration may be progressive as long as the seizures are intractable. Management includes confirmation of the type (or types) of seizures, exclusion of an intracranial epileptogenic lesion, and use of appropriate antiepileptic drug therapy. Referral of affected patients to a comprehensive epilepsy center for possible surgical treatment and investigational drug studies should be considered. In the care of the patient with intractable partial epilepsy, the goals should be to render the patient free of seizures and to allow the patient to become a participating and productive member of society.\r"

We investigated human exposure to these potentially toxic substances in relation to the consumption of fish from the Baltic Sea. METHODS. Plasma levels of 10 different dibenzofurans and 7 dioxins were analyzed in three groups of Swedish men: one group with a high intake of fish (fish eaten almost daily; n = 11), one with a moderate intake of fish (about once per week; n = 9), and one with no consumption of fish (usually because of allergy; n = 9). RESULTS. Plasma levels of several of the compounds we measured were higher in the men with a high intake of fish than in those who consumed moderate amounts, and the levels were higher in those who ate moderate amounts of fish than in those who ate none. The median amounts of the most toxic dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) were 8.0 pg per gram of plasma lipid (range, 2.0 to 13) in the high-intake group, 2.6 pg per gram (range, 1.2 to 4.2) in the moderate-intake group, and 1.8 pg per gram (range, 1.0 to 2.5) in the nonconsumers (P = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). There were consistent and statistically significant associations between the reported amount of fish eaten and the plasma levels of several of the dibenzofurans and dioxins. CONCLUSIONS. Contaminated fish such as those from the Baltic Sea are an important source of exposure to polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dibenzodioxins in persons who eat fish regularly. However, the clinical consequences of such exposure remain uncertain.\r"

In initial clinical trials in adults, ddl showed evidence of antiretroviral activity with little hematologic toxicity. METHODS. We conducted a phase I-II study in 43 children with symptomatic (CDC class P-2) HIV infection. Of these children, 16 (median age, 10 years) had previously received zidovudine, and 27 (median age, 2.6 years) had not. ddl was administered orally in three divided doses totalling 60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 24 weeks. Eight of the 43 patients did not complete 24 weeks of ddl: 6 died, 1 was withdrawn because of progressive disease, and the other because of toxicity. RESULTS. After oral administration, ddl was rapidly absorbed, although its bioavailability varied greatly among patients. Pancreatitis developed in two children, one receiving ddl at each of the two highest doses. The median CD4 cell count in 38 patients with paired counts increased from 0.218 x 10(9) per liter (218 per cubic millimeter) at base line to 0.327 x 10(9) per liter (327 per cubic millimeter) after 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.001). Those with CD4 cell counts above 0.1 x 10(9) per liter (100 per cubic millimeter) at base line were significantly more likely to improve in this respect. The median levels of p24 antigen (in 27 patients with detectable levels at entry) declined from 272 pg per milliliter at base line to 77 pg per milliliter at 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.005). The plasma concentration of ddl correlated significantly with both the degree of decline in the p24 antigen and the degree of improvement in IQ score. Improvement in clinical and immunologic measures occurred in both the previously untreated patients and in those who had been treated with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS. Dideoxyinosine was well tolerated and showed promising antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected children. The correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of ddl indicates that bioavailability is an important consideration in the use of ddl to treat HIV infection and that individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment may be important for optimal activity.\r"

Using a decision-analysis model, we studied the cost effectiveness of chemotherapy in cohorts of 45-year-old and 60-year-old women with node-negative breast cancer by calculating life expectancy as adjusted for quality of life. The analysis evaluated different scenarios of the benefit of therapy: improved disease-free survival for five years, with a lesser effect on overall survival (base line); a lifelong benefit from chemotherapy; and a benefit in disease-free survival with no change in overall survival by year 10. The base-line analysis assumed a 30 percent reduction in the relative risk of recurrence for five years after treatment. RESULTS. For the 45-year-old woman, the base-line analysis found an average lifetime benefit from chemotherapy of 5.1 quality-months at a cost of $15,400 per quality-year. The 60-year-old women gained 4.0 quality-months at a cost of $18,800 per quality-year. Under the more and less optimistic scenarios, the benefit of chemotherapy varied from 1.4 to 14.0 quality-months for both groups. CONCLUSIONS. Chemotherapy substantially increases the quality-adjusted life expectancy of an average woman at a cost comparable to that of other widely accepted therapies. This benefit decreases markedly if the changes in long-term survival are less than in disease-free survival. Given its uncertain duration, the benefit may be too small for many women to choose chemotherapy. Selective use of chemotherapy to maximize the benefit to individual patients may be possible with refinements in risk stratification and explicit assessment of the patients' risk preferences.\r"

The factors studied included the laser beam diameter, coupler optics, laparoscope lumen size, and absorption of the laser wavelength by the insufflation gas. The addition of CO2 insufflating gas to the operating channel at higher power settings not only reduced the energy transmitted to tissue by 35-58% with a 7.2-mm laparoscopic operating channel and by as much as 61% with a 5-mm operating channel, but also increased the spot size. This \"blooming\" of the laser beam definitely reduced power density at tissue and eliminated the pinpoint spot size needed for microdissection. Even under optimal conditions regarding lumen size and beam diameter, our data indicate a point of diminishing returns for power density above 40 W for the systems tested. Power densities obtainable at laparotomy were not possible. Clinically, this effect resulted in optimal cutting (vaporization) at low power settings and coagulation accompanying cutting at higher settings.\r"

  ".W": "Manganese(II)-N,N'-dipyridoxylethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetate-5,5'-bis (phosphate) (MnDPDP) is a paramagnetic complex designed for use as a hepatobiliary agent. The T1 relaxivity of MnDPDP (2.8 [mmol/L]-1.sec-1 in aqueous solution) was similar to that of gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (4.5 [mmol/L]-1.sec-1) and gadolinium tetraazocyclodecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA) (3.8 [mmol/L]-1.sec-1). However, in liver tissue the T1 relaxivity of MnDPDP (21.7 [mmol/L]-1.sec-1) was threefold higher than that reported for Gd-DOTA (6.7 [mmol/L]-1.sec-1). Maximum liver T1 relaxation enhancement occurred 30 minutes after injection of MnDPDP, at which time 54MnDPDP biodistribution studies indicated that 13% of total body activity was in the liver. Enhanced (MnDPDP, 50 mumol/kg) MR images showed a fivefold increase in tumor-liver contrast-to-noise ratio over baseline unenhanced images. Results of the authors' acute and subchronic toxicity studies suggest that MnDPDP will be safe at the doses necessary for clinical imaging; at 10 mumol/kg, the safety factor (LD50/effective dose) for MnDPDP is 540, significantly greater than the safety factor of Gd-DTPA (ie, 60-100).\r"

An imaging study was performed to investigate the presence of contrast enhancement or facilitated visualization of normal structures. Twelve healthy subjects receiving MnDPDP at doses of 3, 10, or 15 mumol/kg were imaged after injection for approximately 30 minutes at 1-5-minute intervals. Transaxial abdominal images were obtained at 1.5 T in a single breath-hold interval of 21 seconds with use of a spin-echo pulse sequence (repetition time = 150 msec, echo time = 20 msec). Liver parenchyma enhancement was observed 1 minute after injection and persisted for at least 30 minutes. Clearance into the gallbladder was visualized within 15 minutes. Enhancement was dose-dependent; a dose of 10 mumol/kg produced a 75%-100% signal enhancement of the liver at 10 minutes after injection.\r"

The coat protein of the filamentous bacteriophage Pf3--which infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa--is 44 amino acids in length and has the same basic structure as the coat protein of bacteriophage M13, which infects Escherichia coli. However, unlike the Pf3 coat protein, the M13 coat protein is synthesized as a precursor (procoat) with a typical leader (signal) sequence, which is cleaved after membrane insertion. Nevertheless, when the gene encoding the Pf3 coat protein is expressed in E. coli, the protein is translocated across the membrane. Hybrid M13 and Pf3 coat proteins were constructed in an attempt to understand how the Pf3 coat protein is translocated without a leader sequence. These studies demonstrated that the extracellular regions of the proteins determined their cellular location. When three charged residues in this region were neutralized, the leader-free M13 coat protein was also inserted into the membrane. Differences in the water shell surrounding these residues may account for efficient membrane insertion of the protein without a leader sequence.\r"

Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Striatopallidal neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced elevation in their specific expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the D2 dopamine receptor and enkephalin, which is reversed by subsequent continuous treatment with the D2 agonist quinpirole. Conversely, striatonigral neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced reduction in their specific expression of mRNAs encoding the D1 dopamine receptor and substance P, which is reversed by subsequent daily injections of the D1 agonist SKF-38393. This treatment also increases dynorphin mRNA in striatonigral neurons. Thus, the differential effects of dopamine on striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons are mediated by their specific expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes, respectively.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the role of 31P MR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of renal transplant allograft dysfunction. Thirty-six 31P MR spectroscopy examinations were prospectively performed in 35 patients with renal allografts. The study was performed in two phases. In the first phase, 12 transplant recipients with normal graft function were studied as normal controls. During phase two, 24 31P MR spectroscopy studies were performed in patients at the time of renal transplant biopsy for allograft dysfunction. Twenty-one of these studies were technically adequate. Pathologic analysis of the biopsy specimens showed evidence of allograft rejection in 14 and no rejection in seven. Various phosphorus metabolite ratios were calculated for each patient, including phosphodiesters/phosphomonoesters (PDE/PME), phosphomonoesters/inorganic phosphate (PME/Pi), and inorganic phosphate/adenosine triphosphate (Pi/ATP). The PDE/PME and Pi/ATP ratios in the allografts with rejection differed significantly from the corresponding metabolite ratios in patients without rejection (p = .017 and p = .024, respectively). A PDE/PME ratio exceeding 0.8 had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 86% for predicting rejection. A Pi/ATP ratio greater than 0.6 had a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 86% for predicting rejection. We conclude that 31P MR spectroscopy may be useful as a noninvasive method for evaluating renal metabolism during episodes of transplant allograft dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is characterized by pain, hyperthermia, and cutaneous changes and has been linked to an abnormality of regional blood flow. The disease is associated with previous injury or trauma including surgery, but also has been found in association with myocardial infarctions and tumors. The final diagnosis can be made only on the basis of the clinical course, which is characterized either by regression without sequel or the appearance of aponeurotic and tendinous retractions including bony sclerosis in the affected region occurring over many months to years. The literature and our own results show that MR imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosing transient osteoporosis of the hip, which is generally thought to be a form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Therefore we investigated the usefulness of MR imaging for diagnosing sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Twenty-five patients underwent T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging of the affected body region. They were selected on the basis of the initial clinical findings and positive findings on scintigraphy, which is known to be a sensitive, but not very specific, imaging method for sympathetic dystrophy. The final diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical course in 17 of the 25 patients. In 10 of these, findings on MR images were completely normal, in six the MR images showed only nonspecific soft-tissue changes or bone marrow sclerosis, and in one patient they showed changes in bone marrow signal. Of the remaining eight patients without a final diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, MR showed soft-tissue or bone marrow alterations in six. MR imaging appears to be of little value in establishing the diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, but it may improve diagnostic specificity when used in conjunction with scintigraphy.\r"

To verify this, we retrospectively reviewed MR and arthroscopic findings in 54 consecutive patients. Arthroscopy showed a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus in seven patients and was considered diagnostic. Sagittal MR images were reviewed without knowledge of the arthroscopic results. The presence of a curvilinear low-signal band above the tibial cortex anterior, inferior, and parallel to the posterior cruciate ligament was identified on MR images in all seven of the patients in whom the presence of a bucket-handle medial meniscal tear was confirmed by arthroscopy.

  ".W": "A bucket-handle tear of the meniscus is a vertical or oblique tear with longitudinal extension toward the anterior horn in which the inner fragment is frequently displaced toward the intercondylar notch with resultant mechanical locking of the knee joint. A precise MR diagnosis requires identification of the centrally displaced fragment because the peripheral nondisplaced component may have only a subtle truncated or foreshortened appearance that may escape detection. Eighteen consecutive cases of displaced bucket-handle tears of the medial meniscus diagnosed by MR had a characteristic low-signal band extending across the joint and projecting over the medial tibial eminence. The posterior portion was parallel and beneath the posterior cruciate ligament on both sagittal and coronal images. Arthroscopy confirmed the presence and location of the displaced fragment in all 18 cases. Awareness of this characteristic MR finding may increase the sensitivity of MR imaging in the diagnosis of bucket-handle tears of the medial meniscus.\r"

  ".U": "91076051\r", 
  ".W": "In an attempt to differentiate among joint effusion, synovitis, pannus, and subchondral sclerosis in patients with clinically proved chronic rheumatoid arthritis, we used gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging to examine 23 patients with acute knee symptoms. All patients had had rheumatoid arthritis for more than 6 months and satisfied four or more of the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for rheumatoid arthritis. MR imaging was performed on a 1.5-T machine by using unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo imaging, unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging, and unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging. Signal intensities of the synovium and bone marrow were measured with the region-of-interest technique on unenhanced and enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo scans. Conventional radiographs were available for each patient. Joint effusion, synovitis, intraarticular pannus, subchondral sclerosis, and subchondral pannus had the same signal intensities on unenhanced T1-weighted spin-echo, unenhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo, and unenhanced T2*-weighted gradient-echo MR images, and could not be differentiated from one another. On enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, pannus and synovitis showed marked enhancement in 15 patients, whereas joint effusion and sclerosis did not. Synovitis was diagnosed if the synovial membrane showed high enhancement; pannus was diagnosed if enhancing masses were seen within the joint space or in the subchondral area. In eight of the 23 joints, there was no enhancement of the synovium or intraarticular or subchondral tissue. We conclude that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging allows differentiation between synovitis and joint effusion and between subchondral pannus and subchondral sclerosis. Enhancement of the synovium and pannus indicates acute inflammation of the joint.\r"

In only five of eight was the extent of the abnormality clinically apparent. All three infants with megalourethra and imperforate anus died because of the coexistence of other severe congenital anomalies. Prior literature has described but not stressed the increased prevalence of urethral abnormalities in children with the VATER association. Because of the high prevalence (eight of 20) of significant urethral anomalies, we perform voiding cystourethrography on all males with the stigmata of the VATER association, even in the absence of clinical symptoms.\r"

The pseudomass results from compression of the thymus gland by air under pressure. To the unwary, the resulting configuration can lead to an erroneous diagnosis of a mediastinal mass. In experienced hands, however, it can serve as a strong clue to the presence of an underlying anterior pneumothorax. A pseudomass was present in 27 (33%) of 82 neonates with unilateral pneumothoraces and in 29 (88%) of the 33 patients with bilateral anterior pneumothoraces. A free lung edge was visualized in 26% of the patients with a unilateral pseudomass and in 55% of the neonates with a bilateral pseudomass. The pseudomass was large enough to potentially lead to a misdiagnosis in one third of the cases. In the other neonates the mass was smaller and not particularly problematic. The majority of the neonates with pseudomasses were large, not intubated, and not on positive-pressure assisted ventilation. Over half had no underlying pulmonary disease. The appearance of a mediastinal pseudomass on radiographs of neonates can obscure a pneumothorax, and lead to an erroneous diagnosis. Recognition of the pseudomass as a manifestation of pneumothoraces is important.\r"

Their location was consistently in the lower mesencephalon near the junction of the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle. Unilateral lesions were observed in 18 cases, while bilateral lesions were noted in 14. A review of anatomic specimens revealed the constant presence of penetrating branches of the collicular or accessory collicular arteries in this location. Enlarged perivascular spaces around these vessels were frequently seen in the specimens and probably account for punctate and linear foci observed on high-resolution MR images of the midbrain.\r"

  ".W": "This investigation evaluates whether gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement of three-dimensional (3-D) acquisition MR angiography can generate clinically useful images of the normal venous anatomy of the brain. 3-D MR angiography of normal cerebral arterial anatomy has made rapid progress, although demonstration of detailed venous anatomy with similar techniques has been much less revealing. To overcome the limitation of slow venous flow, IV gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast enhancement was used to alter the relaxation times of blood, thus augmenting the venous signal. Several groups of patients were evaluated: we studied eight patients both with and without contrast enhancement, 20 patients and volunteers with multiple techniques to determine optimal technical parameters, and seven patients in whom enhanced MR studies were compared with standard selective biplane cut-film arterial angiograms. Only the large dural sinuses (such as the transverse sinus) could be seen on unenhanced studies owing to the saturation of slowly flowing venous spins. With contrast enhancement, many of the important small and large cerebral venous structures were routinely seen with reasonable scanning times (7 min). The venous anatomy was well seen for approximately one-half hour after injection and correlated well with angiograms. There are several important limitations to this technique, including a limited field of view, variable visibility of specific veins owing to technical and physiologic factors, confusion of enhancing non-flow-related structures, and lack of detailed physiologic information. Single excitation 3-D MR angiograms are insensitive in the evaluation of cerebral venous structures. Enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine affords rapid scanning and excellent visualization of the pertinent venous anatomy. The best image quality was obtained with a sequence of 50/7/30 degrees (TR/TE/flip angle).\r"

These include the impact of PACS on physician productivity, maintenance costs, discount rates, and the time period for amortization of capital goods. The effectiveness of PACS is also explored in terms of improvements in diagnostic accuracy and timely diagnosis. Financial and clinical impacts should be integrated to provide information about how PACS expenditures will affect radiology departments, hospitals, and national research and development objectives.\r"

CT features useful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions, limitations and pitfalls in CT interpretation, overlap in the CT appearance, and classical CT features leading to specific diagnoses are described and illustrated. Although CT is established as one of the most important techniques for imaging the gastrointestinal tract, it should be used selectively and only in the context of appropriate clinical and conventional radiologic examination. CT should not be regarded as competing with, but as complementing, barium examination of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

Definitive diagnosis and treatment in the past have required laparoscopy or laparotomy with tubal resection. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization with fluoroscopically guided catheters has emerged as an improved method both for diagnosis and treatment in these patients. Technical success rates for overcoming the obstruction and visualizing distal tubal anatomy range from 76% to 95%. Pregnancy rates after the procedure vary depending on the patient populations studied; however, early results indicate a greater than 50% intrauterine pregnancy rate by 1 year. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is approximately 10% and that of early tubal reocclusion is less than 30%. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization is recommended as the first intervention in patients with obstruction of the proximal fallopian tube.\r"

Because they cause signs and symptoms when quite small (by virtue of their ACTH production), they may not be detected by CT. MR imaging was performed in 10 consecutive patients with surgically proved ACTH-producing bronchial carcinoid tumors in order to test the ability of MR to clarify equivocal or indeterminate findings on CT examinations. All bronchial carcinoid tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted and short-inversion-time inversion-recovery images, facilitating their distinction from pulmonary vasculature. In eight patients, the CT and MR images were equivalent in the detection of bronchial carcinoid tumors. In two patients, MR showed tumors in the middle third of the lung that were equivocal on CT. MR imaging may distinguish small bronchial carcinoid tumors from adjacent pulmonary vessels in the central third of the lung at a time when the CT study is nondiagnostic or equivocal.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture caused by blunt injury is often difficult because of serious concurrent injuries, a lack of specific clinical signs, and simultaneous lung disease that may mask or mimic the diagnosis radiologically. Previous reports have suggested that a preoperative diagnosis is established on the basis of chest radiographs in only one third of patients. In order to assess the value of chest radiographs and other imaging techniques in diagnosing traumatic rupture of the diaphragm, we retrospectively reviewed all preoperative diagnostic imaging performed in 50 patients with surgically proved hemidiaphragmatic rupture due to blunt trauma. Chest radiographs were diagnostic in 20 (46%) of 44 patients with left-sided rupture and were considered suspicious enough to warrant further diagnostic studies in an additional eight patients (18%). Five patients with initially normal findings on chest radiographs had diagnostic findings on delayed chest radiographs. Chest radiographs were strongly suggestive in only one (17%) of six patients with right-sided hemidiaphragmatic rupture. CT was diagnostic for diaphragmatic rupture in only one (14%) of seven instances in which it was performed. MR was diagnostic in both patients in whom it was performed. Our experience indicates that chest radiographs obtained at admission and repeated soon after are more valuable in suggesting the diagnosis of traumatic rupture of the diaphragm than previously reported, particularly in the more frequent, left-sided injuries. This increased sensitivity may be due to a greater level of suspicion maintained in a trauma referral center in which this injury is not uncommon.\r"

Residents had an assigned block of time to do mammography in 84% of the programs. Of the 206 programs, 40% had rotations devoted exclusively to mammography, with 82% of the exclusive rotations lasting from 4 to 8 weeks. Residents were performing localization procedures in 91% of the programs and dictating cases in 81%. A distinction was made between screening and diagnostic examinations by 35% of the training institutions, at least in terms of the fee for the examination. Radiologists who devoted at least half of their practice to mammography taught in 52% of the programs. The American College of Radiology has granted accreditation in mammography to 29% of the programs. Although almost all accredited residency training programs offer training in mammography, there are some deficiencies in this training. More residents need to gain the experience of dictating mammography reports and need to learn about the distinctions between screening and diagnostic mammography. Despite the anticipated deluge of screening examinations in the next decade, there were only 17 fellowships that included at least 6 months of mammography identified in 15 (7%) of the institutions; only 11 of these were full-time 1-year breast imaging fellowships.\r"

Of the 23 with cancer, 11 had neoplastic involvement of the SMA and 12 did not. Prominent thickening of the area around the SMA with (six patients) or without (five patients) decreased echogenicity compared with the adjacent retropancreatic connective tissue was observed in patients with involvement of the SMA, a finding called the \"cuff sign.\" Mean thickness of the periarterial area in the cancer patients with and without involvement of the SMA and in control subjects were 8.5 mm, 4.0 mm, and 2.9 mm, respectively. With an upper limit of normal of 7.0 mm for the thickness of the SMA, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of this sign in the evaluation of involvement of the SMA were 91%, 100%, and 96%, respectively. Decreased echogenicity of the periarterial area was not observed in patients without involvement of the SMA or in control subjects. Our results show that sonographic evidence of periarterial thickening of the root of the SMA (cuff sign), especially with decreased echogenicity, is a reliable finding of tumor infiltration of the SMA in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

We report soft-tissue effects seen up to 1 year after biliary extracorporeal shock waves were administered to 18 Yucatan pigs. The gallbladder received 4000 electromagnetic shock waves from a Siemens Lithostar overhead module. Blood samples were drawn from each pig for hematologic, coagulation, and biochemical profiles immediately before and then at prescribed time intervals after administration of shock waves. Autopsy and histopathologic examination of the gallbladder and surrounding organs were performed. Kidneys and adrenal glands also were examined in five pigs followed up for 1 year. There were no gross or microscopic abnormalities in 11 animals, including all five animals in the 1-year group in which kidneys and adrenal glands also were normal. One animal (3-week group) had two 2-mm foci of parenchymal necrosis in the right lobe of the liver, probably related to ischemia after shock-wave therapy. Transient rise in liver and pancreatic enzyme levels was seen in most animals after administration of shock waves. The levels returned to normal within 2 months in all but one animal. We conclude that biliary ESWL with the Lithostar Plus does not produce long-term histologic evidence of organ damage in Yucatan pigs.\r"

In the absence of diagnostic sonographic findings, patients may be subjected to an unnecessary invasive liver biopsy for an accurate diagnosis. We recently described the association of the pulsatile portal venous waveform on duplex Doppler sonography with tricuspid regurgitation in 15 patients. In this study I describe the changes in the hepatic venous waveform in these patients and compare the findings with the final diagnosis as determined by Doppler echocardiography (n = 14) or ultrafast CT (n = 1). All patients had clinical findings consistent with liver dysfunction and were referred for sonography to rule out diseases of the liver, biliary tree, or hepatic or portal veins. All patients had persistently dilated hepatic veins and inferior venae cavae. Twenty-four volunteers, 11 of whom had simultaneous ECG tracings, served as a control group. The main findings on the hepatic duplex sonogram in the disease group were a decrease in the size of the antegrade systolic wave with a systolic/diastolic flow velocity ratio of less than 0.6 (n = 4) or reversal of the systolic wave (n = 10). In all volunteers, systolic flow was antegrade and the ratio was more than 0.6. Two diagnoses were false positive and one was false negative. In some patients with sonographic signs of congestive heart failure, duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein may be helpful in the diagnosis of one of the causes of liver dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation.\r"

The main, left, and right portal veins (collectively referred to as intrahepatic portal veins), superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and shunt were assessed for flow direction, presence of thrombi, and collaterals. Patent shunts were visualized in 12 (75%) of the 16 cases. Clot was detected in 27 (69%) of 39 intrahepatic portal veins in patients with end-to-side shunts, in six (67%) of nine intrahepatic portal veins in patients with distal splenorenal shunts, and in five (5%) of 92 intrahepatic portal veins in patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in two (15%) of 13 patients with patent shunts (one end-to-side portacaval shunt and one distal splenorenal shunt). Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in 26 (93%) of 28 patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Our data suggest endoscopic sclerotherapy preserves antegrade portal flow and results in fewer portal vein clots than surgical portosystemic shunts do. Patterns of thrombosis and flow direction vary unpredictably from patient to patient. Shunt patency should not be inferred without direct visualization of the shunt.\r"

Accurate CT assessment of pancreatic vascular perfusion would be helpful in preoperative planning before pancreatic debridement and necrosectomy. The CT scans and medical records were blindly and retrospectively reviewed in 13 patients with the operative diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. In all cases, CT examinations preceded surgery within 72 hr. Surgical and pathologic findings served as the gold standards for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Seven (54%) of 13 patients had a region or regions of parenchymal necrosis within the head, body, and/or tail of the pancreas seen during surgery. All seven of these patients had no pancreatic enhancement on CT in at least one region of the pancreas (CT sensitivity = 100%). In four of the seven, two regions were found to be necrotic at surgery, but only one of the two segments did not enhance on CT scans. In three of the seven patients, lack of contrast enhancement on CT (no enhancement of the pancreatic head and body in two patients and throughout the gland in another) correlated with necrosis in the same regions at surgery. The remaining six (46%) patients, who had peripancreatic or small, focal, and/or superficial areas of pancreatic necrosis at surgery, had normal pancreatic enhancement on CT. Our results show that regions of pancreatic necrosis found surgically correlate with lack of enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma on CT. Peripancreatic necrosis and minor areas of focal or superficial parenchymal necrosis were not detected on CT.\r"

The catheters were inserted into the urinary bladder via the urethra and advanced into the ureters and renal pelvis under cystoscopic control; then, cross-sectional images of the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis were obtained. Two dogs and seven human patients were studied. In one dog, a 4.5-mm pseudopolyp, which was surgically created in the bladder wall, was successfully imaged; in the other, stones 2 mm or larger inserted into the bladder were identified. Of the seven patients, sonography showed stones embedded in the renal parenchyma (one patient) and the mucosa of the distal ureter (one patient). These were ultimately confirmed by their eventual removal. In a third, sonography showed a tumor of the distal ureter and identified the depth of the tumor. This was confirmed by biopsy. In a fourth, sonography clearly showed a crossing vessel as the cause for narrowing of the proximal ureter. In a fifth, sonography showed that the cause of a ureteral stricture was idiopathic. In the last two cases, sonography did not reveal a cause for hematuria. In these last three cases, negative sonographic results were confirmed by direct ureteroscopic examinations and follow-up studies. Our observations based on this limited study suggest that endoluminal sonography is a useful procedure for diagnosing diseases of the urinary tract. Further study is warranted.\r"

Serum albumin concentration (P less than 0.005) and iron-binding capacity also rose. Serum immunoglobulins did not change. The numbers of total lymphocytes (P less than 0.005) and CD8+ cells rose but CD4+ cells did not change. The tube and enteral feedings were well tolerated.

Infants greater than or equal to 30 wk GA had significantly greater concentrations of PLP by day 3. In the second study there was a negligible response of serum PLP in nine infants less than or equal to 28 wk GA to supplementation of pyridoxine or pyridoxal. However, erythrocyte PLP and whole-blood total vitamin B-6 concentrations increased in both groups, indicating the presence of a substantial amount of the vitamin in the circulation of the infants. Whereas the functional significance of these observations is not known, it appears that in premature infants, serum PLP may not be an appropriate indicator of vitamin B-6 status.\r"

Similar changes have been noted in growth-retarded, nonanemic fetuses, and we therefore hypothesized that isoimmunized fetuses requiring intrauterine transfusions might have diminished growth. We longitudinally studied growth patterns in 17 isoimmunized fetuses by noting biparietal diameter and head and abdominal circumference measurements at each transfusion. The distributions of these measurements above and below the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles derived from our general obstetric population were compared at the initial transfusion and the last ultrasonogram performed before delivery. Birth weights also were noted and their distribution around the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles was compared to the expected distribution. For each ultrasonographic parameter, the distribution of measurements at the last ultrasonogram before delivery was not significantly different from the distribution at the initial ultrasonogram. The birth weight distribution also was not significantly different than the expected distribution. Thus we were unable to demonstrate slowing of fetal growth in our severely isoimmunized pregnancies.\r"

The effects of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and both interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on cell growth were measured after 24 and 72 hours of incubation by the incorporation of chromium 51. The results of this analysis showed that all seven cell lines were resistant to the antiproliferative action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, that the growth of most cell lines was inhibited by interferon-gamma by 72 hours of incubation, and that after 72 hours of incubation all cell lines demonstrated a synergistic antiproliferative response to the combination of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, the effects of these cytokines on cell growth were found to differ among cell lines and varied with the concentration and the duration of incubation. The growth of one cell line (Caov-3) was stimulated by both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. These results suggest that the clinical effects of these cytokines on the growth of gynecologic cancers may be more complex than previously supposed.\r"

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins, proteins with unique and specific saccharide-binding characteristics, and heparin are potentially useful markers for such an analytical procedure. A protocol is outlined whereby frozen semen is thawed and treated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated soybean agglutinin SBA (Glycine max), peanut agglutinin PNA (Arachis hypogaea), and garden pea agglutinin PSA (Pisum sativum) lectins or fluorescein isothiocyanate-heparin to assess differences in spermatozoa-bound fluorochrome by flow cytometry. Use of propidium iodide to identify nuclei containing sperm cells within the ejaculate is essential to the method because of the large amount of debris associated with the samples. The precision of the assay is high, with the coefficient of variation for the individual probes being less than 20%. Analysis of a patient pool of 22 revealed that a range in binding properties is observed and a mode of grouping these samples into classes for later analysis is outlined. Semen parameters and fluorescein isothiocyanate-ligand binding values were different in a population of unproven fertility as compared with a comparable population of known fertility. A positive correlation (p less than 0.001) for garden pea agglutinin PSA binding and concentration of motile cells, percentage of motility, and number of motile cells was found. These data suggest the possible utility of flow cytometry for the assessment of human seminal samples.\r"

The predictive value of single-dose administration for the pharmacokinetic behavior of a progestin during long-term treatment was investigated for two triphasic oral contraceptives. One contained levonorgestrel and the other gestodene, each in combination with ethinyl estradiol. In eight Japanese women who received the levonorgestrel-containing formulation over a treatment cycle, steady-state trough levels of levonorgestrel were higher than those obtained by computer simulation based on single-dose administration. An analogous observation was made in a group of 10 white women who received the gestodene-containing formulation. A close correlation between gestodene and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations was demonstrated for eight subjects; the other two patients already had initially high sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Ethinyl estradiol-induced production of sex hormone-binding globulin seems to be a major factor that contributes to the accumulation of the two progestins in the plasma. Computer simulation, based on single-dose pharmacokinetics, allows an estimation of this contribution.\r"

The pharmacologic evaluation of these metabolites demonstrates that only 17-deacetyl norgestimate has a pharmacologic profile consistent with that of norgestimate, and significant concentrations of this metabolite have been measured in the serum of women after the administration of norgestimate. These studies indicate that 17-deacetyl norgestimate contributes to the pharmacologic response to norgestimate.\r"

The pharmacokinetic properties of desogestrel were characterized by the following parameters: (1) maximum serum concentration, (2) time to maximum serum concentration, (3) total area under the serum concentration versus time curve, and (4) serum half-life of elimination. The interindividual variation in these parameters was comparable with that observed with other contraceptive combinations containing ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone, levonorgestrel, or gestodene. The serum distribution of contraceptive progestogens is known to be determined by their affinity to sex hormone-binding globulin and the concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin. We analyzed the structural features that determine binding to sex hormone-binding globulin. The 18-methyl group increased and the 11-methylene group weakened the binding to sex hormone-binding globulin. The double bond at C-15 reinforced the binding only when combined with an 18-methyl group. Therefore, the binding of levonorgestrel (the 18-methyl derivative of norethisterone) and gestodene (the delta-15,18 methyl derivative of norethisterone) to sex hormone-binding globulin was much stronger than that of 3-keto-desogestrel and norethisterone.\r"

With regard to binding to sex hormone-binding globulin, gestodene, levonorgestrel, and to a lesser extent 3-ketodesogestrel (which is only formed from the prodrug desogestrel in the body), show a behavior that is manifested in the relatively high affinity to sex hormone-binding globulin, whereas desogestrel and norgestimate do not display any measurable affinity for this specific steroid-binding serum protein. Furthermore, levonorgestrel and gestodene dissociate very much more slowly from the binding sites of sex hormone-binding globulin than 3-ketodesogestrel. A natural affinity of all these synthetic progestogens tested for corticosteroid-binding globulin could not be established. Gestodene, levonorgestrel, and 3-ketodesogestrel bind to the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and androgen receptor with high affinity, apart from slight differences, whereas estrogen receptor affinity could not be demonstrated in any of the progestogens investigated. In relation to aldosterone, the relative binding affinity values of gestodene, levonorgestrel, and the natural progestogen progesterone are relatively high, whereas 3-ketodesogestrel does not display any measurable affinity for this receptor species.\r"

The levels of gestodene and 3-keto-desogestrel increased between days 1 and 21 of each cycle, reaching maximal levels during the third and sixth cycles. The serum concentrations of gestodene were fourfold to fivefold higher than those of 3-keto-desogestrel. The ethinyl estradiol levels increased significantly between days 1 and 10 during each cycle and were significantly higher by 70% during intake of ethinyl estradiol/gestodene compared with ethinyl estradiol/desogestrel, although the dose was identical. Intake of gestodene, in addition to 35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol + 2 mg of cyproterone acetate, caused a rise in ethinyl estradiol levels. During treatment with ethinyl estradiol/gestodene and an additional 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel, there was a continuous increase in gestodene levels, although sex hormone-binding globulin level did not change. During treatment with 30 or 35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol and 75 micrograms of gestodene, 150 micrograms of desogestrel, or 2 mg of cyproterone acetate, there were large intraindividual and interindividual variations in the steroid levels and ratios of estrogen: progestogen levels. There was no correlation with the occurrence of intermenstrual bleedings. It is concluded that ethinyl estradiol and nortestosterone derivatives may inhibit steroid-metabolizing enzymes in the liver, which results in a rise in the serum levels of contraceptive steroids. The cause of the large intraindividual variations is as yet unknown, but it is probably from changes in steroid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of mupirocin calcium ointment in the elimination of Staphylococcus aureus nasal and hand carriage in healthy persons. DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. SETTING: Clinical research unit of a tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS: Health care workers with stable S. aureus nasal carriage. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects (n = 68) were randomly assigned to receive either mupirocin or placebo intranasally twice daily for 5 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cultures of the hands and nares were obtained at baseline and 72 hours after therapy. The nares were also cultured 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks after therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid DNA were used to confirm strain identity. There were no serious side effects. Mupirocin decreased the frequency of S. aureus nasal carriage at each time interval: At 3 months, 71% of subjects receiving mupirocin remained free of nasal S. aureus compared with 18% of controls. This difference (53%; 95% CI; 26% to 80%) was significant (P less than 0.0001). Additionally, analysis of plasmid patterns showed that 79% of subjects in the mupirocin group were free of the initial colonizing strain at 3 months. The proportion of hand cultures positive for S. aureus in the mupirocin group after therapy was lower than in the placebo group (2.9% compared with 57.6%). This difference (53%; 95 CI, 30% to 80%) was significant, after adjustment for the frequency of hand carriage at baseline (P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: When applied intranasally for 5 days, mupirocin calcium ointment is safe and effective in eliminating S. aureus nasal carriage in healthy persons for up to 3 months and appears to have a corresponding effect on hand carriage at 72 hours after therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Light-induced formation of oxygen free radicals has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of photic retinal injury. We investigated the role of hydroxyl radical in retinal photic injury by treating dark-adapted albino rats with intraperitoneal dimethylthiourea 3 hours before exposure to intense fluorescent light. Dimethylthiourea is a specific antioxidant against hydroxyl radical. We demonstrated that dimethylthiourea penetrates well into retinal tissue and has a half-life of approximately 19 hours. Morephologic differences between the control and dimethylthiurea-treated rats were not remarkable 6 hours after light exposure, but they became significant 6 and 14 days after light exposure. Morphometric studies showed that there was significantly better preservation of photoreceptor nuclei in dimethylthiourea-treated rats 6 and 14 days after light exposure. Rhodopsin levels were significantly higher in the dimethylthiourea-treated rats 6 hours and 14 days after light exposure, while rhodopsin levels were comparable in the control and dimethylthiourea-treated rats 6 days after exposure. The differences in morphometry and rhodopsin levels between the control and dimethylthiourea-treated rats were statistically significant in relationship to dimethylthiourea treatment. The superior and temporal retinal quadrants appeared most vulnerable to photic injury in control rats 6 and 14 days after light exposure. These findings indicate that dimethylthiourea ameliorates retinal photic injury, and that hydroxyl radical plays an important role in mediating retinal photic injury.\r"

  ".W": "A directed-search strategy for point mutations in the factor VIII gene causing hemophilia A was used to screen eight potentially hypermutable CpG dinucleotides occurring at sites deemed to be of functional importance. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA samples from 793 unrelated individuals with hemophilia A were screened by discriminant oligonucleotide hybridization. Point mutations were identified in 16 patients that were consistent with a model of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) deamination. Four new examples of recurrent mutation were demonstrated at the following codons: 336 (CGA----TGA), 372 (CGC----TGC), 372 (CGC----CAC), and 1689 (CGC----TGC). These are functionally important cleavage sites for either activated protein C or thrombin. Further novel C----T transitions were identified in the remaining arginine codons screened (-5, 427, 583, 795, and 1696), resulting in the creation of TGA termination codons. Differences in mutation frequency were found both within and between the CpG sites and between ethnic groups. These differences are assumed to be due to differences in the level of cytosine methylation at these sites, although direct evidence for this inference is lacking.\r"

The prolonged bleeding time was accompanied by normal platelet counts. Platelet aggregation with collagen and agglutination with ristocetin were not significantly altered in RIIIS/J mice. Also, platelets from RIIIS/J mice had normal serotonin content and normal numbers of dense granules by electron microscopy. Thus, the bleeding abnormality is not due to platelet storage pool deficiency as has been found in several other mouse mutants. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) which plasma from RIIIS/J mice was prolonged compared with normal mice, and factor VIII:C activity and von Willebrand antigen levels were one half to one third that of normal mouse plasma. Factor XI activity was also significantly deficient (levels at 42% to 64% of normal). Plasma of RIIIS/J mice contained the full complement of multimers of von Willebrand factor, although each multimer was lower in concentration compared with that in normal mice. Platelet alpha-granule von Willebrand antigen levels were similar to those of normal mice. The prolonged bleeding time of RIIIS/J mice was corrected by treatment with desmopressin. Heterozygous C57BL/6J x RIIIS/J F1 animals had low plasma von Willebrand antigen levels like the RIIIS/J parent and had variable bleeding times. Inheritance of the bleeding tendency was as an incomplete dominant, autosomal trait. These data indicate the RIIIS/J strain is a suitable animal model for type IA von Willebrand disease.\r"

  ".W": "Several investigators have reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can alter the production of plasminogen activator type-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activators (PAs) by endothelial cells in vitro. We have examined the in vivo effects of recombinant human TNF administration on fibrinolysis as assessed by parameters in plasma during a 24-hour period of continuous TNF infusion to 17 cancer patients with active disease. The plasma levels of PAI activity increased sevenfold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion. This was the result of an increase of PAI-1 antigen; PAI-2 antigen was not detectable. Plasma concentrations of tissue-type PA (t-PA) antigen increased twofold to fivefold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion, whereas urokinase-type PA antigen levels in plasma remained unaltered. After 3 hours of TNF infusion the plasma levels of alpha 2-antiplasmin were slightly decreased, 5% on average, suggesting that fibrinolysis continued. After 24 hours of TNF infusion a highly significant increase in fibrin- plus fibrinogen-degradation products, and separately of fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen degradation products, was found. This indicates that fibrinolysis persisted, at least partly, in the presence of high levels of PAI activity. Whereas PAI-1 production increased, t-PA production by human endothelial cells in vitro remains unaltered or even decreases on TNF addition. It has been shown previously that TNF infusion in our patients results in thrombin and fibrin generation. Therefore, it is possible that thrombin, not TNF, is the actual stimulus for t-PA production in our patients. We speculate that fibrin is formed during TNF infusions and that plasmin is generated by t-PA action immediately on the initial formation of (soluble) fibrin molecules. Such a process may explain the generation of degradation products of both fibrin and fibrinogen during infusion of TNF in patients.\r"

In Sjogren's disease, Graves' disease, and essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, which are also associated with the development of B-cell neoplasia, clonal B-cell expansions have been detected. Eleven patients with ITP were investigated for the presence of a clonal excess (CE) using kappa-lambda flow cytometry and DNA analysis for rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes in blood and/or spleen lymphocytes. In 10 of 11 patients, clonal B-cell populations were found by one or both tests. In three of these patients, oligoclonal B-cell populations were suggested by the combined findings. In all four patients with a small paraproteinemia, the isotype was confirmed by either flow cytometry or DNA rearrangement analysis. Our data suggest that the oligoclonal expansions are not restricted to CD5+ B cells, as in the majority of patients this subset was below the detection level of flow cytometry or DNA rearrangement analysis. None of the patients developed clinical manifestations of malignant lymphoma during a follow-up period of 10 to 44 months after sampling. We conclude that clonal excess populations of B cells are not a unique feature of malignant lymphoma, but may occur in autoimmune diseases, suggesting a benign (oligo)clonal B-cell proliferation.\r"

The 42-Kd sialoglycoprotein has not been previously demonstrated to be expressed on T cells, thymocytes, or T-cell malignancies. We identified three patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome that showed low density expression of the CD24-related epitope recognized by antibody BA-1 on circulating T cells. All three patients had Sezary cells by morphologic assessment and clonal T-cell populations in the peripheral blood by gene rearrangement studies. In two of these patients, indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of six anti-CD24 monoclonal antibodies demonstrated reactivity for two of six antibodies in one case and only one of six antibodies in the other. The biologic significance of CD24-related epitope expression on circulating T cells in mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome is unclear. However, these findings suggest that differential, low density expression of CD24-related epitopes (BA-1+, OKB2-) may be a useful phenotypic marker for identifying circulating Sezary cells.\r"

  ".W": "The processing of the neutral proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase, normally synthesized in myeloid precursor cells and stored in azurophil granules, were investigated by biosynthetic labeling with 14C-leucine of the monoblastic cell line U-937. The proteases were precipitated with specific antibodies and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography. The transfer to lysosomes of newly synthesized proteases was demonstrated in pulse-chase labeling experiments followed by centrifugation of cell homogenates in a Percoll gradient. The presence of a closely spaced polypeptide band-doublet at intermediate gradient density suggested cleavage of the specific aminoterminal pro dipeptide extension before storage in lysosomes. The molecular heterogeneity observed for cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase seemed to be due to modifications occurring after sorting into lysosomes, most likely because of C-terminal processing. Modifications of the secreted enzymes were not detectable by SDS-PAGE. In contrast to other lysosomal enzymes, no phosphorylation was demonstrated. Newly synthesized cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase rapidly became resistant to endoglycosidase H, indicating transport through the medial and trans cisternae of the Golgi complex and conversion to \"complex\" oligosaccharide side chains. This conversion was inhibited by an agent swainsonine, but translocation from the Golgi complex and secretion were unaffected. The processing described may play a role in activation of the proteases.\r"

Cytokines, principally interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, are thought to mediate the release of acute phase proteins from hepatocytes. Employing a sensitive bioassay based on the hybridoma growth factor properties of interleukin-6, we investigated its levels in sequential sera obtained from 15 initially untreated patients with PMR/GCA. We found that interleukin-6 activity was significantly elevated in all untreated patients. Although there was a significant decline in its levels after successful steroid therapy, seven patients continued to have raised serum levels of interleukin-6 for up to 6 months after initiation of treatment. Activated endothelial cells are a potent source of interleukin-6 and its persistence in the circulation may be taken as evidence of continuing disease activity. What is not explicable is the normalization of the acute phase response soon after the commencement of steroid therapy when circulating levels of interleukin-6 are still high. This suggests that steroids may be having additional effects on hepatocyte function.\r"

Patients with poor exercise capacity (exercise time less than 6 min) on dynamic exercise test had decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, increased left atrial diameter, and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), compared with patients with better exercise capacity (exercise time greater than 6 min). Plasma ANP was significantly higher in patients with poor exercise capacity and impaired cardiac function (202 pg/ml [95% confidence interval 119 to 284] at rest and 227 pg/ml [149 to 304] during exercise), compared with patients with better exercise capacity (75 pg/ml [50 to 102], p less than 0.005, and 123 pg/ml [80 to 167], p less than 0.05, respectively). Plasma ANP increased significantly (p less than 0.005) during exercise only in patients with better cardiac function. The best correlation among the variables studied was found between LVMI and plasma ANP concentration at rest (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001) and during exercise (r = 0.51, p less than 0.005), whereas neither blood pressure nor renal function showed any significant correlation with ANP levels. We conclude that plasma ANP levels are elevated in uremic patients with impaired cardiac function, correlating with increased LVMI. Plasma ANP determinations are useful in identifying increased cardiac load and consequent cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction with known associations with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic renal failure.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibody and its relationship to the severity of liver disease in chronic alcoholic patients has been assessed, using a recently developed enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by a recombinant immunoblot assay, in 144 patients (mean age +/- S.D. = 44.4 +/- 11.3 yr) who had consumed greater than 80 gm/day ethanol for greater than 5 yr. Hepatic disease was evaluated by clinical and biochemical studies and by liver biopsy when appropriate. In addition, 76 liver biopsy specimens from these patients were analyzed to determine whether liver lesions were similar in alcoholic patients with and without hepatitis C virus antibodies. According to clinical and histological features alcoholic patients were divided into five groups: normal liver (45 patients), fibrosteatosis (20 patients), alcoholic hepatitis (14 patients), cirrhosis (61 patients) and chronic hepatitis (4 patients). Hepatitis C virus antibodies were present in 35 alcoholic patients (24.3%). The prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibodies correlated with the severity of liver injury: 2.2% in patients without liver disease, 20% in those with fibrosteatosis, 41.4% in those with alcoholic hepatitis and 42.6% in those with cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus antibodies were found in one of the four patients with chronic hepatitis (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, patients positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies with normal liver or fibrosteatosis showed higher serum bilirubin and gamma-globulin concentrations and lower aminopyrine breath test scores than did patients negative for hepatitis C virus antibodies with normal liver or fibrosteatosis. Similar differences between patients with and without hepatitis C virus antibodies were observed in patients with alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The major autoantigens of PBC have been identified as the four closely related mitochondrial enzymes PDC-E2, BCKD-E2 OGDC-E2 and protein X. A major structural similarity of these enzymes is the presence of one or more lipoyl domains. The immunodominant epitope of each autoantigen has either been postulated or been demonstrated to be located within the lipoate binding region. However, it is not clear whether the binding of lipoic acid to the epitope is necessary for autoantibody recognition. To address this issue we have constructed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutatagenesis three mutants in the lipoyl domain of human PDC-E2. Because lipoic acid is covalently bound to the zeta-amino group of the lysine residue of PDC-E2, the mutants were designed to replace the lysine residue in the lipoyl domain with glutamine, a negatively charged amino acid; histidine, a positively charged amino acid; and tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid. Binding reactivity of sera from patients with PBC were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting and specific absorption against each of the three mutants and control clones. All data were compared with parallel studies with a control recombinant clone, the liver-specific F alloantigen. We believe the recognition of the lipoyl domain is a reflection of the surface-exposed, hydrophilic and relatively mobile nature of this region of the autoantigen. Further studies on direct assay for the presence of lipoic acid will be needed to clarify these issues.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the poorly understood mechanisms of intracellular transport of bile acids, fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate was synthesized and its ring-OH-linked structure established by fast atom bombardment, mass spectroscopy and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. Biliary secretion of fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate and [14C]-labeled glycocholate in rats was similar, in contrast to the biliary secretion of sodium fluorescein and methylamine-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate, which are non-bile acid organic anions. After incubation of cultured hepatocyte doublets with fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate, serial quantitative image analysis of fluorescence was performed in the cellular cytoplasm, perinuclear zone and bile canaliculus. Uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate into the cytoplasm was inhibited by removal of sodium from the medium and by addition of glycocholate or taurocholate. After preincubation with colchicine, but not lumicolchicine, the proportion of perinuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate increased during incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate. Neither fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate uptake nor canalicular secretion was affected. By confocal microscopy the perinuclear zone containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate was identified as the Golgi apparatus by fluorescent colocalization with C6-NBD-ceramide, which specifically identifies the Golgi apparatus. We conclude that colchicine inhibits fluorescein isothiocyanate-glycocholate transfer from the Golgi apparatus to the bile canaliculus. These results suggest that intracellular bile acid transport involves microtubule-dependent vesicular movement from the Golgi apparatus to the bile canaliculus. The role of this process in normal physiology is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "Thymocyte cell suspensions, prepared from mice at different ages, were cultured in vitro with human rIL-2. This stimulation resulted in a cell population that contained almost 50% TCR-gamma delta-positive cells if thymocytes were taken from fetal day 17 until just after birth. Analysis of the variable (V gamma) region used by the TCR-gamma delta cells revealed that 90% of them expressed TCR-V gamma 3, and less than 5% expressed TCR-V gamma 2. Cells positive for TCR-alpha beta were barely detectable. If fetal day 18 organ cultured thymus lobes, instead of a cell suspension, were stimulated with IL-2, no rise in the number of TCR-V gamma 3+ or TCR-delta+ cells was observed, whereas a partial outgrowth of TCR-alpha beta+ cells occurred. From day 1 after birth, the number of TCR-gamma delta cells recovered from an IL-2-stimulated thymocyte cell suspension dropped to reach a plateau of 15% of the total cell number, whereas TCR-V gamma 3+ cells became undetectable in older animals. TCR-alpha beta+ cells, on the other hand, quickly rose in cell number after birth. Kinetic analysis showed that the preferential outgrowth of TCR-V gamma 3+ cells in IL-2-stimulated fetal day 18 thymocyte cell suspensions was present from the onset of the culture; a significant proliferation of CD4 or CD8 single positive TCR-alpha beta cells was never observed. This lack of proliferation of TCR-alpha beta cells was not due to inhibition by the activated TCR-V gamma 3+ cells. Throughout the IL-2 culture, one-fourth of the TCR-V gamma 3+ thymocytes was positive for CD8. Analysis of the DNA content and the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) p55 expression showed that during the first days of culture the TCR-V gamma 3+ cells had a much higher proliferation rate than the TCR-V gamma 3- cells, although TCR-V gamma 3+ IL2R p55+ cells could not be detected. From day 3 to 4 of culture, the proliferation rate of TCR-V gamma 3+ cells equaled that of the rest of the cells and less than 20% of the TCR-V gamma 3+ cells expressed the IL-2R p55. The biologic significance of our findings is discussed.\r"

Transplantation tolerance across H-2D plus IE Ag-barriers has been achieved when B10.Thy-1.1 (Kb,IAb,IE-,Db; Thy-1.1) mice were primed i.v. with 9 x 10(7) spleen cells plus 3 x 10(7) bone marrow cells from B10.A(5R) mice (5R; kb,IAb,IEb,Dd; Thy-1.2) and treated i.p. with 200 mg/kg of CP 2 days later. The tolerant state in the early and the late stage was confirmed by prolonged acceptance of donor-type skin grafts, and in vitro unresponsiveness to donor Ag. In the tolerant B10.Thy-1.1 mice treated with 5R cells 28 days earlier and followed by CP, intrathymic clonal deletion of V beta 11+ T cells reactive to IE-encoded antigens was observed in association with intrathymic mixed chimerism. 5R skin survived, however, even after the clonal deletion of V beta 11+ T cells terminated by 180 days after tolerance induction. V beta 11+ T cells, which reappeared in the periphery of the recipient B10.Thy-1.1 mice bearing 5R skin at this stage, were not capable of proliferating in response to receptor cross-linking with V beta 11-specific mAb. Furthermore, the CTL activity against class I (Dd) alloantigens of spleen cells from these tolerant mice was restored by the addition of IL-2 to MLC. Thus, our experiments provide direct evidence that tolerance to both class I (Dd) and class II (IEb) alloantigens by clonal allergy occurs during the termination of intrathymic clonal deletion. These results clearly show practical hierarchy of the mechanisms of transplantation tolerance.\r"

  ".W": "Grafting of cells from B10.D2 (H-2d) donors into H-2 compatible lethally irradiated (DBA/2 x B10.D2)F1 hosts results in a severe graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR), developed against DBA/2 non-H-2 Ag, with only 0 to 10% of animals surviving. This GVHR mortality rate is dramatically reduced (90 to 100% of animals survive) by donor preimmunization against Mlsa determinants. The protection against GVHR correlates with a decreased B10.D2 anti-DBA/2 proliferative response in vitro. Both in vivo and in vitro phenomena are associated with activation of CD5+ suppressor T cells in the spleens of immunized mice. The present work was designed to study the origin of these suppressor cells and to further characterize their phenotype. The results show that significant suppression is not inducible in \"B\" mice. In contrast, in mice that were only thymectomized or else pretreated in vivo with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAb, the suppressor cells are activated as efficiently as in normal mice. The suppression of GVHR mortality and proliferative responses in vitro is lost after depletion from preimmunized splenocytes of CD5+ T cells and remains unaltered after depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or both. Depletion of asialo GM1+ cells removes all NK activity, whereas the suppression is decreased only slightly. FACS analysis showed that double-negative (DN) cells from normal and immunized mice contain both CD3+ and CD3- cells; the vast majority of the CD3+ DN T cells express the alpha/beta T cell receptor. Suppression of GVHR and of proliferative responses in vitro are abrogated after elimination of CD3+ cells. These results suggest that Mlsa generated suppressor cells: 1) are derived from post-thymic long-lived T cell precursors; 2) are low asialo GM-1+ but do not exhibit NK activity; 3) belong to a subset of peripheral CD5+ DN T cells bearing a CD3-associated alpha/beta-heterodimer.\r"

We have previously shown that the RPE cell may also be important in autoimmunity and transplantation. These cells can be induced by cytokines to express MHC class II Ag in ocular inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In this report we show that isolated rat RPE cells can be induced to express class II Ag following incubation with rat rIFN-gamma. The ability of RPE cells to present Ag was determined by both T cell proliferation assays and IL-2 production. Only the Ia-positive RPE cells can present retinal Ag (S-Ag and interphotoreceptor-binding protein) to specifically sensitized rat Th cells. Moreover, the ability of chloroquine to inhibit this activity suggests that the RPE cell is also capable of processing Ag prior to Ag presentation. These studies indicate that cytokine-mediated activation of RPE cells may be a basic component of ocular immunity and an important aspect of RPE cell transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter, which can be stimulated by IL-1. CAT activity in cell lysates and PGE2 release in the supernatants were measured in control and stimulated cell cultures in parallel. Human IL-1 beta (180 pM) and human rTNF-alpha (3 nM) significantly stimulated both CAT activity and PGE2 release. The combined incubation of the two cytokines resulted in a synergistic effect on PGE2 release. The addition of AA (30 microM) greatly stimulated PGE2 release without affecting CAT activity. Similarly, drugs interfering with AA metabolism were without effect on CAT activity although profoundly reducing PGE2 release. Forskolin (0.1 microM) did not modify either parameter. The glucocorticoid fluocinolone (20 nM) was able to decrease both parameters. Protein kinase inhibitors H7 (5-50 microM) and sphingosine (50 microM) inhibited only IL-1-induced CAT activity, whereas H8 (5-50 microM) and HA1004 (50 microM) were ineffective on both parameters. PMA (0.5 microM) and R59 022, a diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor (10 microM), did not modify either control or IL-1-induced CAT activity. IL-1-stimulated PGE2 release was potentiated by PMA, although this effect was not inhibited by H7. The data suggest that: 1) in NIH 3T3 cells the activation of AA metabolism by IL-1 is not involved in IL-1-induced gene expression; 2) protein kinase C activity is required but not sufficient for IL-1-induced gene expression; and 3) PMA may stimulate AA metabolism by a mechanism in part independent of protein kinase activity.\r"

Both adult and day 15 fetal thymocytes (CD4-8-, CD4+8-, CD4-8+) proliferate strongly in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, and B-TCGF. B-TCGF alone does not stimulate thymocyte proliferation. B-TCGF appears to be identical to a novel cytokine whose cDNA was recently isolated at our institution, cytokine synthesis-inhibitory factor (CSIF; IL-10). rIL-10 has B-TCGF activity, and mAb specific for IL-10 inhibit the B-TCGF activity present in CH12 supernatants. Further studies have shown that day 15 fetal thymocytes cultured in the presence of IL-10, IL-2, and IL-4 remain CD4- and CD8- but exhibit increased CD3 expression. Adult CD4- CD8- thymocytes cultured under the same conditions proliferate whether they are CD3+ or CD3-. The CD3- population becomes enriched in CD3+ cells after 4 days of culture. IL-10 is secreted by day 15 fetal thymocytes, adult thymocytes, and adult splenocytes when stimulated via their TCR. IL-10 is strongly homologous to the EBV gene BCRFI, and BCRFI has CSIF activity. In contrast to IL-10, BCRFI does not exhibit detectable thymocyte-stimulating activity, suggesting the existence of at least two functional epitopes on the IL-10 molecule.\r"

Recently it has been shown that alterations in the levels of circulating cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha occur shortly after bacterial challenge. To understand better the role of IL-6 in inflammation, we investigated the effects of in vivo anti-mouse IL-6 antibody treatment in a mouse model of septic shock. Rat anti-mouse IL-6 neutralizing mAb was produced from splenocytes of an animal immunized with mouse rIL-6. This mAb, MP5-20F3, was a very potent and specific antagonist of mouse IL-6 in vitro bioactivity, demonstrated using the NFS60 myelomonocytic and KD83 plasmacytoma target cell lines, and also immunoprecipitated radiolabeled IL-6. Anti-IL-6 mAb pretreatment of mice subsequently challenged with lethal doses of i.p. Escherichia coli or i.v. TNF-alpha protected mice from death caused by these treatments. Pretreatment of E. coli-challenged mice with anti-IL-6 led to an increase in serum TNF bioactivity, in comparison to isotype control antibody, implicating IL-6 as a negative modulator of TNF in vivo. Anti-TNF-alpha treatment of mice challenged i.p. with live E. coli resulted in a 70% decrease in serum IL-6 levels, determined by immunoenzymetric assay, compared to control antibody, thereby supporting a role for TNF-alpha as a positive regulator of IL-6 levels. We conclude that IL-6 is a mediator in lethal E. coli infection, and suggest that antagonists of IL-6 may be beneficial therapeutically in life-threatening bacterial infection.\r"

The molecular locus of self-binding has also been identified by showing that a peptide derived from the CDR2/FR3 region of the V1 S107 H chain inhibits self-binding. We have addressed the question of whether self-binding antibodies interact with peptides that inhibit self-binding. We found that labeled TEPC15 (T15) binds to immobilized VH (50-73) peptide; the peptide binding is specific because different CDR peptides and other unrelated peptides do not inhibit this binding. Furthermore, the hapten phosphorylcholine is a potent inhibitor for the T15-peptide binding. We have demonstrated the presence of naturally occurring antibodies that bind to the T15H(50-73) peptide in the sera of different strains of mice and also in humans, indicating that the CDR2/FR3 sequence of T15 is a conserved Id determining region. We have isolated peptide-specific antibodies from pooled normal human Ig preparations. Human anti-peptide antibodies have self-binding properties similar to their murine counterparts. This interspecies conserved peptide binding of antibodies that are self-binding indicates the existence of an evolutionarily important and biologically active site.\r"

Cyclooxygenase is the first enzyme in the pathway that converts AA to PGE2. To examine the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in IL-1-mediated PGE2 production, we treated cells with PMA, which stimulated PGE2 production suggesting a positive role for PKC activation in the regulation of PGE2 synthesis. Therefore, we tested the effect of sphingosine, a PKC inhibitor, on IL-1-induced PGE2 production. Alone, sphingosine had little effect on PGE2 production. However, when sphingosine was added with IL-1, or IL-1 was added to sphingosine-pretreated cells, PGE2 production increased severalfold, suggesting that the inhibition of PKC results in enhanced IL-1-mediated PGE2 production; structural analogs of sphingosine did not potentiate the IL-1 effect. In cells made deficient in PKC by prolonged exposure to PMA, IL-1-mediated PGE2 production was enhanced compared with normal cells, further suggesting that functional PKC is not required for, and may down-modulate, IL-1-mediated PGE2 production. These findings also suggest that PMA and IL-1 stimulate PGE2 synthesis via fundamentally different pathways. In separate studies on the effect of IL-1 on AA mobilization, we found that IL-1 induced an increase in phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and that cycloheximide blocked the increase, suggesting the requirement for new protein synthesis. We also found that the PLA2 activity increased as a result of IL-1 exposure was further stimulated by sphingosine. Thus, in addition to its primary effects on the cell, which are likely mediated via PKC, we present evidence suggesting that sphingosine may also play a role in potentiating an IL-1-induced PLA2 activity, resulting in increased availability of AA for conversion to PGE2.\r"

  ".W": "Various cell surface receptors are phosphorylated upon binding of their ligand, and this phosphorylation seems to be involved in the signal transduction or in the feedback regulation of this signal. The possibility of a phosphorylation of the human IFN-gamma receptor (hu-IFN-gamma-R) has been investigated with 32P-labeled whole Raji cells and receptor purification either by immunoprecipitation with an anti-hu-IFN-gamma-R polyclonal antiserum or by affinity chromatography. The hu-IFN-gamma-R was found to be phosphorylated at a basal level. Upon incubation of the cells with recombinant hu-IFN-gamma, a dose-dependent two-fold increase of this phosphorylation was observed. Phosphoamino acid analysis by TLC showed that the same amino acids, serine and threonine, are phosphorylated at a basal level and after incubation with hu-IFN-gamma. Protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase pathways have been reported in some cases to be involved in the signal transduction pathway of hu-IFN-gamma. Both pathways involved the activation of a serine/threonine kinase and therefore we have investigated the possibility of hu-IFN-gamma-R phosphorylation by these kinases. PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, induced a rapid increase of the receptor phosphorylation in Raji cells, whereas the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 did not. PMA-induced hu-IFN-gamma-R phosphorylation was not associated with any effect on expression or inactivation of the receptor. PMA alone did not mimic the hu-IFN-gamma effect in Raji cells as measured by induction of IP-10 gene expression, a high specific marker of hu-IFN-gamma response. But the protein kinase C inhibitors, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) and staurosporine, reduced this IFN-gamma-induced expression. However, H7 and staurosporine treatment as well as protein kinase C depletion suppressed PMA-induced receptor phosphorylation, whereas constitutive and hu-IFN-gamma-induced phosphorylation remained unchanged. Our results suggest that the serine/threonine kinase involved in the hu-IFN-gamma-R phosphorylation induced by IFN-gamma is different from protein kinase C.\r"

Picolinic acid acts synergistically with IFN-gamma in activating M phi from C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, M phi from C3H/HeJ mice and C3H/HeN that do not become cytotoxic in response to IFN-gamma alone could be fully activated by exposure to picolinate plus IFN-gamma. These results indicate that picolinic acid is a potent costimulator of M phi activation that functions as a second signal. Inasmuch as we have previously demonstrated that the activation of cytotoxic M phi correlates with specific changes in ribosomal RNA (rRNA), we investigated whether picolinic acid could modify M phi RNA metabolism. Picolinic acid inhibited the synthesis of total M phi RNA, the accumulation of newly synthesized 28S rRNA, and augmented the steady state levels of rRNA precursors (pre-rRNA). These changes in RNA metabolism were similar to those previously described in murine M phi activated in vitro or in vivo to express tumoricidal activity. These results demonstrate that picolinic acid is a potent, biologic M phi second signal, suggest that the changes in rRNA are causally connected with the expression of tumoricidal activity, and suggest the existance of an autocrine effect mediated by picolinic acid.\r"

This antimicrobial activity of activated macrophages correlates with the initiation of nitrogen oxidation of L-arginine, yet other reports suggest that two signals are required for induction of this biochemical pathway for effector activity. In the present studies, macrophages treated with up to 100 U/ml IFN-gamma, or 100 ng LPS, or 10(7) amastigotes produced minimal quantities (less than 9 microM) of NO2- and failed to develop cytotoxic effector activities. In contrast, the combination of IFN-gamma and either LPS (greater than 0.1 ng) or amastigotes (10(6) induced high concentrations (much greater than 30 microM) of NO2- and macrophage cytotoxicity against intra- and extracellular targets. The induction of nitrogen oxidation by amastigotes could be dissociated from LPS-induced events by 1) performing the assays in the presence of polymyxin B (which blocked LPS effects, but not amastigote effects), 2) determining the threshold of IFN-gamma required to prime cells for subsequent trigger (1 U/ml for LPS trigger effects; 10-fold higher for amastigotes), and 3) determining the heat sensitivity of the two trigger agents (amastigote effects abolished at 100 degrees C; LPS effects unaffected at this temperature). Further, culture fluids from amastigote-infected macrophages did not contain detectable LPS (less than 6 pg/ml). Possible parasite and cell-associated factors that could contribute to the induction of nitrogen oxidation and cytotoxic activity of IFN-gamma treated macrophages were examined: only certain intact microorganisms, LPS from a variety of bacteria, and the cytokine TNF alpha were effective. Both NO2- production and intracellular killing were abolished by the addition of anti-TNF-alpha mAb in the assay. TNF-alpha was produced by amastigote-infected macrophages and IFN-gamma dramatically enhanced secretion of this cytokine; IFN-gamma alone had no effect. Endogenous TNF-alpha produced during infection of macrophages with L. major acted in an autocrine fashion to trigger the production of L-arginine-derived toxic nitrogen intermediates that killed the intracellular parasites.\r"

The doses of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha used were suboptimal in that either cytokine alone did not have any effect. The therapeutic effect of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo is reflected in their ability to activate macrophages to kill the intracellular parasites in vitro. The macrophage leishmanicidal activity induced by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma can be completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor (L-NG monomethyl arginine) of nitric oxide synthesis. There was a direct correlation between the intracellular killing of the parasites and the production of nitric oxide by the macrophages. In contrast, there was no correlation between leishmanicidal activity and superoxide production by macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "The murine B cell line CH12.LX.C4.5F5 (CH12 (5F5) expresses adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) receptors, which can modulate IgM secretion by these cells. Interestingly, the response to ACTH was concentration dependent, inducing IgM secretion at subnanomolar amounts and suppressing secretion at micromolar amounts. With the use of an enzyme-linking immunospot assay it was possible to demonstrate that the ACTH-induced increase in IgM secretion by CH12 (5F5) cells was caused at least in part by an increase in the number of cells secreting IgM. CH12 (5F5) cells activated with suboptimal concentrations of LPS demonstrated a similar biphasic response. ACTH at concentrations of 10(-13) to 10(-9) M augmented IgM secretion in LPS-activated cells as much as sixfold, whereas 10(-6) M ACTH slightly decreased LPS-induced IgM secretion. At the mRNA level, subnanomolar concentrations of ACTH increased microH chain mRNA expression up to twofold in unstimulated or LPS-stimulated CH12 (5F5) cells. Taken together, these studies show that physiologically relevant concentrations of ACTH can interact directly with receptors on these B lymphocytes to enhance IgM secretion and microH chain mRNA expression. Although ACTH does increase intracellular cAMP levels in CH12 (5F5) B cells, it is unlikely that the induction of this second messenger pathway is by itself responsible for the ACTH induced B cell differentiation. The concentration of ACTH necessary to stimulate significant intracellular cAMP increases was 10- to 100-fold higher than that required to increase IgM secretion. Furthermore, CH12 (5F5) cells treated with varying concentrations of 8-bromo cAMP or cholera toxin were inhibited in their ability to secrete IgM. These results strongly suggest that the enhancing effects of ACTH on CH12 (5F5) IgM secretion are via mechanisms independent of those mediated by cAMP.\r"

The transformed cells did not show constitutive expression of IL-2 or c-fos mRNA, although the promoter regions of both IL-2 and c-fos genes contain AP-1 sites that are expected to be targets for binding of Fos/Jun complexes. In contrast, the transformed T cells showed increased constitutive expression of IL-2R alpha and c-myc mRNA; these genes may represent cellular targets for transformation by v-fos and physiologic activation by c-fos. We discuss the possibility that these transformed cells behave as cells partially activated through the TCR, and that transformation occurs through a mechanism independent of IL-2.\r"

  ".W": "PGE2 is known to inhibit IL-2 and IFN-gamma production from Th cells and is widely viewed as a general immunosuppressant. However, PGE2 was found not to inhibit IL-4 production from Th2 clones, and IL-5 production from these clones was slightly enhanced. The same results were obtained with short term T cell lines, which indicates that the lack of inhibition of IL-4 and IL-5 production by PGE2 is a general phenomenon. PGE2 functions by increasing cAMP levels through activation of adenylate cyclase. Despite its failure to inhibit lymphokine release, PGE2 was capable of increasing cAMP levels in Th2 cells, and forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, also did not inhibit IL-4 or IL-5 production. These data indicate that the failure of PGE2 to inhibit IL-4 and IL-5 production was not due to an inability of PGE2 to induce an increase in intracellular cAMP, and suggested instead that the expression of IL-4 and IL-5 in Th2 cells is insensitive to elevated cAMP levels. When Th0 clones were examined, PGE2 was again found to differentially affect IL-2 and IL-4 production in three of five clones tested. In two additional Th0 clones, both IL-2 and IL-4 production were inhibited. These data suggest that lymphokine production may be regulated on two different levels. First, Th1- and Th2-associated lymphokines may be differentially sensitive to intracellular signals such as cAMP. Second, T cell subsets may exist, including subsets of Th0 cells, with different signaling pathways. In addition, our data suggest that PGE2 may play an important role in regulating the development of a response dominated by Th1- or Th2-associated lymphokines.\r"

  ".W": "The enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus are the most potent mitogens known. They belong to a group of distantly related mitogenic toxins that differ in other biologic activities. In this study we have compared the molecular mechanisms by which these mitogens activate human T lymphocytes. We used the staphylococcal enterotoxins A to E, the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin, the streptococcal erythrogenic toxins A and C (scarlet fever toxins, erythrogenic toxins (ET)A, ETC), and the soluble mitogen produced by Mycoplasma arthritidis. We found that all these toxins can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and require MHC class II expression on accessory and target cells. However, T cells could be activated in the absence of class II molecules if the toxins ETA or SEB were co-cross-linked on beads together with anti-CD8 or anti-CD2 antibodies. Enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin and scarlet toxins stimulate a major fraction of human T cells, and show preferential, but not exclusive, stimulation of T cells carrying certain TCR V beta. In contrast, the mitogen of M. arthritidis, a pathogen for rodents stimulates only a minority of human T cells but activates a major fraction of murine T cells. Analysis of human T cell clones expressing V beta 5 or V beta 8 TCR showed that these clones responded also to those toxins that did not stimulate V beta 5+ and V beta 8+ T cells in bulk cultures. These results indicate that different TCR bind to these toxins with different affinities and that the specificity of the TCR-V beta-toxin interaction is quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. Taken together our findings suggest that these toxins use a common mechanism of T cell activation. They are functionally bivalent proteins crosslinking MHC class II molecules with variable parts of the TCR. Besides V beta, other parts of the TCR must be involved in this binding. The finding that murine T cells responded more weakly to the toxins produced by the human-pathogenic bacteria than to the Mycoplasma mitogen could indicate that the toxins have been adapted to the host's immune system in evolution.\r"

The treatment of macrophages with PMA stimulated the expression of TNF, but not I-A beta, suggesting that the TNF gene is responsive to activators of protein kinase C whereas the I-A beta gene is not. The treatment of macrophages with IFN-gamma led to an increase in the level of RNA for both TNF and I-A beta. The increase in expression of I-A beta and TNF, induced by IFN-gamma, was blocked by naphthalenesulfonamide or phenothiazine (trifluoperazine) but was not affected by the addition of isoquinolinesulfonamide or sphingosine. These results suggest that the induced expression of I-A beta and TNF by IFN-gamma is mediated by a pathway that is protein kinase C independent. This was supported by the finding that calcium ionophores were also able to induce the gene expression of both TNF and I-A beta. We observed that when both IFN-gamma and PMA were added to the macrophages, the level of RNA for TNF increased to a higher level than the level seen when either agent alone was added to the cells. In contrast, the addition of both IFN-gamma and PMA to macrophages had an inhibitory effect on the expression of the I-A beta gene. These results further emphasize the complex nature of gene regulation during the activation of macrophages.\r"

  ".U": "91079536\r", 
  ".W": "The T cell signals that regulate the induction of human monocyte IL-1 during primary immune activation were investigated by using anti-CD3 mitogenesis. The induction of monocyte IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA during anti-CD3 mitogenesis was rapid (less than or equal to 1 h) and required the presence of both T cells and anti-CD3. The addition of T cells plus a nonmitogenic anti-CD5 antibody failed to induce IL-1 alpha or beta mRNA, indicating that IL-1 mRNA induction by anti-CD3 required T cell activation. Experiments using double chamber culture wells revealed that the major initial phase of IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA induction (1 to 12 h) required direct cell contact between monocytes and T cells. A subsequent minor late phase (greater than or equal to 12 h) of IL-1 mRNA was induced independently of cell contact in monocytes that received only soluble factors generated during anti-CD3 mitogenesis and was temporally associated with the appearance in culture supernatants of the late phase IL-1-inducing cytokines, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Metabolic inactivation of T cells using paraformaldehyde demonstrated that the ability of T cells to induce IL-1 mRNA via cell contact was acquired only after activation of T cells via solid phase anti-CD3. Furthermore, pretreatment of T cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine had no effect on T cell-mediated induction of monocyte IL-1 mRNA or cell-associated IL-1 alpha and beta, indicating that the expression of the IL-1 inductive signal did not require protein synthesis. Despite their ability to induce monocyte IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA, activated T cells treated with paraformaldehyde or emetine were no longer able to induce monocytes to secrete IL-1 beta into culture supernatants. However, supernatants from purified T cells that were activated with solid-phase anti-CD3 restored the ability of paraformaldehyde or emetine-treated T cells to induce IL-1 secretion. These studies provide evidence that supports a two-signal model of monocyte IL-1 production during primary immune activation. The first signal leads to the induction of monocyte IL-1 mRNA and is mediated by direct contact with activated T cells, and the second signal is provided by soluble T cell factors and results in IL-1 secretion.\r"

In this cell line IL-1 activates two distinct transmission signal pathways, one leading to increased levels of intracellular cAMP, and the other to the phosphorylation of an 80-kDa substrate of protein kinase C (PKC). To determine whether both pathways are activated upon occupancy of a single IL-1R, we used a mAb, M15, which blocks binding of IL-1 to the 80-kDa IL-1R, known to be expressed in Th2 cells. Whereas M15 was able to inhibit the accumulation of cAMP induced by IL-1, it had no effect on the IL-1-induced phosphorylation of the 80-kDa substrate of PKC or the c-fos mRNA expression. In addition, we show that IL-1 induces the expression of the two proto-oncogenes c-myb and c-myc through the 80-kDa IL-1R, and that this induction is PKC independent. The proliferation of D10A cells in response to IL-1 is blocked by M15, but is unaffected by H-7, a potent inhibitor of PKC. These results indicate that the IL-1-induced proliferation of D10A cells is independent of PKC. In addition, IL-1 induces c-fos mRNA expression in thymocytes but not in EL-4 cells.\r"

The H chain construct was transfected into six hybridoma cell lines expressing Ig L chains. All resulting H and L chain combinations had at least some affinity for ssDNA, whereas five also bound dsDNA to a similar degree as 3H9. The loss of dsDNA binding was correlated with a single amino acid difference between two V kappa 8 L chains. A further characteristic of 3H9, its immunofluorescent staining pattern, was shared by four of the recombinant antibodies, whereas its specificity for cardiolipin was shared with five. The transfections reported here show that a V kappa 3 L chain confers specificity for an RNA-associated epitope and that a V kappa 21E L chain prevents cardiolipin binding. These experiments suggest that the 3H9 H chain contributes essential determinants required for binding to DNA as well as cardiolipin but that L chains can modulate or prevent this binding. L chains may also expand the specificity of a recombinant antibody.\r"

In the current studies, we demonstrate that these anti-Id-induced, Ps-specific antibodies fix complement to the bacterial cell surface, and protect neutropenic mice from fatal P. aeruginosa sepsis. The isotypic distribution of the anti-Id-induced antibodies, however, resembles the restricted pattern (IgM and IgG3) seen after administration of purified Ps to mice. The immunogenicity and number of isotypes of Ps-specific antibody produced could be enhanced by conjugating the anti-Id to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Finally, the anti-Id administered before immunization with purified Ps, primed BALB/c ByJ mice for production of other Ps-specific antibody isotypes (IgG1). These studies show that this anti-Id induces functional anti-Ps antibodies in syngeneic mice, and when used in conjugate form or as a priming agent before Ps immunization, yields an antibody response consistent with \"T cell dependence.\" These immunization strategies may be useful for the induction of polysaccharide-specific antibodies in man.\r"

Morphine produced a significant decrease in both the number and proportion of CD4+/CD8+ double positive (DP) cells. The percentage of the CD4+/CD8-, CD4-/CD8+, and CD4-/CD8- double negative subsets in these mice was proportionally increased. Morphine also increased the proportion of cells expressing either the epsilon-chain of the CD3 complex or the IL-2R. The initial reduction in the proportion of DP thymocytes appeared fully recovered by 10 days post-implantation, although the number of DP thymocytes gradually returned to normal over a 3-wk period. Morphine administration resulted in a marked increase in serum corticosterone levels, and a single injection of dexamethasone mimicked the effects of morphine on thymus differentiation. Furthermore, adrenalectomy abolished the morphine-induced decrease in CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes relative to a sham-operated group. The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that morphine-induced thymic hypoplasia may be mediated by an increase in the circulating levels of corticosterone.\r"

Toward this goal, the human genomic DNA segment encompassing the two exons encoding the membrane anchor peptide of epsilon-chain and their flanking regions was sequenced. Hybrid epsilon and kappa genomic DNA comprising the C regions of human epsilon- and kappa-chains and the H and L chain V regions of the murine mAb BAT123, which reacts with the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1, were constructed. Mammalian expression vectors containing these fusion genes were used to transfect murine myeloma Sp2/0 cells, and transfectants stably expressing on surface and secreting into culture medium chimeric IgE were obtained. The chimeric IgE showed identical Ag-binding properties as the murine mAb BAT123. Acting in concert with the specific peptide Ag polyvalently coupled to a protein carrier, the chimeric antibody could induce histamine release from human blood basophils. These results demonstrate the potential utility of the transfectoma cells and the chimeric IgE in studying the roles of membrane-bound IgE and effects of anti-IgE antibodies on IgE-producing B cells.\r"

  ".W": "Mast cell-committed progenitors are detected in the unique microenvironment of the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-infected mice but not in naive bone marrow. We have determined that MLN cells, after infection, produce high levels of IL-3, IL-4, and IgE, presumably in the form of immune complexes with antigens produced by the infecting helminth. After N. brasiliensis infection, peak production of these factors occurs several days before the peak appearance of mast cell-committed progenitors in the MLN. To determine if these factors play a role in mast cell commitment, we recreated these conditions, in vitro. Naive bone marrow cells were cultured with combinations of IL-3, IL-4, and IgE immune complexes, or on IgE-coated plates, and then assayed for acquisition of the ability to form mast cell colonies when supplemented with fibroblast-conditioned medium alone. IL-3 and IgE immune complexes, and, unexpectedly, IgE immune complexes alone were found to be capable of producing mast cell-committed progenitors, i.e., cells responsive to fibroblast-conditioned medium alone, from bone marrow, whereas IL-4 did not enhance production of mast cell-committed progenitors from bone marrow. Production of IFN-gamma peaked at the same time point as committed progenitor activity and may be responsible for down regulating the response.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ are known to affect various macrophage functions; in particular, exposure in vitro to the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 primes macrophages for tumor cell killing. In the present report, it is shown that treatment with this ionophore similarly mimics IFN-gamma as a priming signal for induction of microbicidal activity. Incubation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages with 10(-7) to 10(-6) M A23187 (in the presence of Ca2+) led to intracellular killing of the protozoan parasite Leishmania enriettii within 24 h, provided LPS (1 ng/ml) was also present; no microbicidal activity was observed using either compound alone. A 4-h exposure to the ionophore in the presence of Ca2+ (priming phase) was sufficient to induce leishmanicidal activity upon reincubation with LPS, here acting as a necessary second signal. Addition of EGTA during the priming phase blocked intracellular killing upon subsequent LPS treatment; microbicidal activity could be restored by excess Ca2+, but not Mg2+, suggesting that changes in the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ are sufficient to mediate the molecular events that lead to acquisition of microbicidal potential. Ionophore-induced leishmanicidal activity was paralleled by a stimulation of the hexosemonophosphate shunt pathway and production of nitrites, which are biochemical correlates of the activated state. In addition, sequential exposure to A23187 and LPS markedly stimulated macrophages to release TNF and PGE2, two agents thought to act as modulators of macrophage activation.\r"

  ".W": "Immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a member of the alpha-herpes virus family, exemplifies the host response to an ubiquitous human viral pathogen. In this investigation of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to VZV, the depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes made it possible to demonstrate CD8(+)-mediated cytotoxic function against autologous VZV-infected lymphoblastoid cells targets. CTL recognition of two major VZV proteins, the immediate early protein (IE62) and gp I, was demonstrated in limiting dilution cultures of T lymphocytes obtained from immune donors, stimulated with inactivated VZV Ag, and tested against lymphoblastoid cells infected with vaccinia recombinants expressing these VZV proteins. Among 11 VZV donors tested at least 20 y after primary infection, the mean precursor frequency for T lymphocytes that recognized the IE62 protein was 1:105,000 +/- 85,000 SD, with a range of 1:13,000 to 1:231,000. The mean frequency of CTL precursors specific for gp I in 11 subjects was equivalent, with a mean of 1:121,000 +/- 86,000 SD (range 1:15,000 to 1:228,000) (p = 0.68). Limiting dilution cultures were also prepared using purified CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocyte populations recovered from PBMC by sterile fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CTL precursors that recognized the IE62 protein or gp I were derived from each of the major T lymphocyte populations by stimulation with inactivated VZV Ag; CD4+ and CD8+ CTL precursor frequencies for the IE62 protein and gp I were equivalent (p = 0.2). We conclude that antiviral CTL activity against targets expressing VZV proteins was mediated equally well by T lymphocytes of the CD4+ or CD8+ phenotype and that antiviral CTL function could be elicited in each subpopulation by exposure to non-infectious viral Ag.\r"

Recent evidence suggests the role of NK cells in the host defense against some intracellular pathogens. We investigated whether NK cells play a role in MAC infection. IL-2-activated human NK cells were incubated with human monocyte-derived macrophages either before or after infection with MAC. Macrophages were lysed 3 and 5 days after infection for quantitation of viable intracellular organisms. Although no killing was observed by nonstimulated macrophages, exposure to IL-2-treated NK cells for 24 h before infection induced macrophage to kill 70 +/- 8% of intracellular MAC by 3 days, and 81% +/- 4% in 5 days (p less than 0.01 for both compared with control). Killing was not blocked by incubation with anti-TNF antibody (Ab) or anti-IFN-gamma Ab. Similarly, incubation of macrophages for 24 h with supernatant obtained from IL-2 activated NK cells was associated with 74 +/- 4% killing of intracellular MAC in 3 days and 81 +/- 6% in 5 days (p less than 0.01 for both compared with control). However, the supernatant-mediated activation was partially blocked by anti-TNF Ab (46 +/- 6%; p less than 0.05) but not by anti-IFN gamma Ab. When infected macrophages were incubated with NK cells 24 h after infection for 48 h, they killed 54 +/- 3% of intracellular M. avium in 3 days and 73 +/- 5% in 5 days (p less than 0.02 for both compared with control). This effect was also not blocked by either anti-TNF or anti-IFN gamma Ab. These results suggest that activated NK cells may have an important role in the intracellular killing of MAC and that the NK-mediated activation of macrophages is in part mediated by TNF.\r"

Enhanced NO2- production was observed for either CBA or C3H/HeJ macrophages undergoing phagocytosis at the time of activation. Other phagocytic stimuli including inert polystyrene latex beads were as effective as Leishmania. No correlation could be demonstrated between the enhanced NO2- release and secretion of products of the respiratory burst or PGE2. However, TNF-alpha secretion was elevated in cultures undergoing phagocytosis and a relationship between hexosemonophosphate shunt activity and NO2- levels was evident. These studies confirm and extend previous reports that phagocytosis plays an important role in the regulation of macrophage physiology.\r"

  ".U": "91079562\r", 
  ".W": "BALB/c mice vaccinated with a temperature-sensitive mutant (TS-4) of Toxoplasma gondii develop complete resistance to lethal challenge with a highly virulent toxoplasma strain (RH). This immunity is known to be dependent on IFN-gamma synthesis. In vitro and in vivo T cell depletions were performed in order to identify the subsets responsible for both protective immunity and IFN-gamma production. When stimulated with crude tachyzoite Ag in vitro, CD4+ cells from vaccinated mice produced high levels of TH1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) but not TH2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5). CD8+ cells, in contrast, produced less IFN-gamma and no detectable IL-2. Nevertheless, they could be induced to synthesize IFN-gamma when exposed in culture to exogenous IL-2. In vivo treatment with anti-CD4 plus anti-CD8 or anti-IFN-gamma antibodies during challenge infection completely abrogated resistance to T. gondii. In contrast, treatment with anti-CD4 alone failed to reduce immunity, whereas anti-CD8 treatment partially decreased vaccine-induced resistance. These results suggest that although IFN-gamma and IL-2-producing CD4+ lymphocytes are induced by vaccination, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells are the major effectors of immunity in vivo. Nevertheless, CD4+ lymphocytes appear to play a synergistic role in vaccine-induced immunity, probably through the augmentation of IFN-gamma synthesis by the CD8+ effector cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that when giving during vaccination, as opposed to after challenge, anti-CD4 antibodies are capable of blocking protective immunity.\r"

After i.p. infection of mice, the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus multiplied in this organ. Viral Ag was found predominantly in the epithelial-reticular cells of the medulla and to a lesser extent in such cells of the cortex. Beginning on day 7 after infection, the virus disappeared, a process that could be blocked by depleting the mice of peripheral T lymphocytes or of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Viral clearance was accelerated by i.v. injection of splenocytes from mice, which themselves were just eliminating the virus. CD8+ cells from CD8-congenic donor mice, most with blast morphology, were detected immunocytochemically in the thymus, predominantly in the medulla. A few CD8+ T lymphocytes from donors not previously infected were also demonstrated in the thymic tissue of infected mice. Our findings indicate that the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has access to the thymus and suggest that it is cleared by the antiviral activity of circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, just as other organs, the thymus appears to be subject to immune surveillance by mature T lymphocytes that have their origin in secondary lymphoid tissues.\r"

Levels of reverse transcriptase activity and p24 Ag in culture fluids of monocytes treated with MCSF 1 wk before and continuously after HIV infection were significantly greater than those of control cells cultured without MCSF. HIV-induced cytopathic effects in the MCSF-treated cultures also increased in both frequency and extent. At any given viral inoculum, the frequency of HIV-infected cells, the level of HIV mRNA/infected cell, and the level of proviral DNA/infected culture in MCSF-treated monocyte cultures were dramatically greater than those in control cultures. These differences were directly related to MCSF concentration to a maximum between 750 and 1000 U/ml MCSF, and were evident at all time points examined through 5 wk. None of the preceding effects was observed when MCSF was added at the time of or 1 wk after HIV infection. These data suggest that the predominant effect of MCSF for control of HIV infection is on the monocyte itself, not the virus. If these in vitro observations extend to the HIV-infected patient, then the variable levels of MCSF in tissue or blood may determine both the susceptibility of macrophages to virus infection and the extent of virus replication in infected cells.\r"

The primed precursors obtained from these female mice generate Qa-1-specific CTL activity upon culture in vitro. Although the presence of the H-Y helper Ag is not required for the in vitro sensitization, no response occurs in the absence of CD4 cells. Addition of unprimed B6.Tlaa CD4 cells from Qa-1 incompatible radiation bone marrow chimeras (B6.Tlaa----B6), that are presumably tolerant to Qa-1b, provide helper activity for Qa-1b-specific CTL. This indicates that although CD4 cells are obligatory for the Qa-1 response, they need not be specific for alloantigens on the APC to generate helper activity in in vitro cultures. Addition of unirradiated B6 CD8-depleted spleen cells to CD4-depleted B6.Tlaa anti-B6 cultures in the presence of either B6.Tlaa CD4 cells or rIL-2 prevents the generation of Qa-1 specific CTL. This inhibition is not due to an anti-idiotypic Ts cell since B6.Tlaa----B6 chimeric cells do not suppress an anti-Qa-1b response. Rather, this finding is consistent with that of a veto cell mechanism. To determine whether CD4 cells themselves exhibit veto activity, highly purified CD4 populations were tested for their ability to inhibit the generation of Qa-1-specific CTL. CD4 cells precultured for 2 to 3 days with Con A and rIL-2 specifically inhibit CTL activity whereas resting cells do not, similar to that noted for CD8 veto cells. The relative efficiency of activated CD4 cells is greater than that of resting NK cells but is less than that of activated CD8 or NK cells. Thus, CD4 cells not only provide helper activity for CTL precursors, but also act as veto cells to prevent the generation of CTL activity.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that T lymphocytes from mice immunized with a high m.w. polysaccharide Ag from Fisher-Devlin immunotype I Pseudomonas aeruginosa can adoptively transfer protection against challenge with the homologous bacterial strain to susceptible mice. This T cell-mediated resistance has been found to be B cell dependent, although serum from immunized mice is incapable of passively transferring protection to nonimmune mice. The current studies demonstrate that T cells from immunized mice possess receptors that permit them to be adsorbed to IgG3-secreting hybridomas, but not to IgM-secreting hybridomas. Cross-linking of antibody on the surface of immune T cells results in release of a soluble factor that inhibits bacterial growth. Treatment of T cells to remove cytophilic antibody eliminates their ability to adoptively transfer protection to nonimmune mice, and the protective ability can be restored by co-incubating the T cells with monoclonal P. aeruginosa-specific IgG3 antibody before adoptive transfer to nonimmune mice. These observations are consistent with a model in which T lymphocytes from immunized mice are activated by cross-linking of FcR for IgG3 to secrete an antibacterial lymphokine. The ability of IgG3 at low antibody concentrations to act synergistically with T lymphocytes to inhibit bacterial growth could explain the evolutionary selection of this antibody isotype as the predominant subclass of IgG secreted in response to bacterial capsular polysaccharide Ag.\r"

To understand the biologic significance of this interaction, we investigated the function of human monocytes against the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans, subsequent to a short exposure to autologous LAK cells. A highly sensitive radiolabel assay, which makes use of the incorporation of [3H]glucose into residual Candida after their incubation with monocytes, was developed to measure antifungal activity. Cultured monocytes, after 2 to 6 h exposure to LAK cells, were found to be substantially suppressed in their ability to control fungal growth. Moreover, monocytes cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-CSF or IL-3, were even more suppressed in function after a short incubation with LAK cells. The effect of GM-CSF was both time and dose dependent, with peak susceptibility induced after 4 days of culture with as little as 10 U/ml of the cytokine. These GM-CSF-cultured monocytes, however, were relatively resistant to inhibition by freshly isolated large granular lymphocytic NK cells. Therefore, IL-2 induces in large granular lymphocytic cells the capacity to inhibit monocyte function. In contrast to GM-CSF and IL-3, IFN-gamma was found to have a protective effect on monocytes, because monocytes cultured 4 days in IFN-gamma were not significantly inhibited by LAK cells. These results indicate that LAK cells may be involved in regulation of monocyte function and suggest that the state of differentiation induced by different cytokines may dictate the level of control of the monocytes by LAK cells.\r"

However, we report that 9 of 15 B cell hybridomas of independent origin have reciprocal fragments of the same size (8-kb BamHI fragments) unrelated to their productive rearrangements. An 8-kb reciprocal fragment has also occurred on about 25% of the kappa alleles of normal splenic B cells.

The predominance of productively rearranged V genes with D regions translated in a preferred frame, is, at least in part, the consequence of selective clonal expansion encompassing at least five to six divisions subsequent to VH-D-JH rearrangement. Selection for clonal expansion appears to be dependent on recognition of the nascent H chain product of certain productively rearranged genes.\r"

  ".W": "Fibronectin synergized with anti-CD3 antibody to promote CD4 cell proliferation in a serum-free culture system whereas no proliferation was observed when CD4 cells were cultured with anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone. In addition, anti-CD29 (integrin beta 1) as well as anti-VLA-5 (human fibronectin receptor) antibodies blocked this CD4 cell activation in this system. Although anti-CD3 alone or fibronectin alone cannot induce IL-2 message by CD4 cells, the combination of anti-CD3 plus fibronectin induced IL-2 message by CD4 cells. In an analysis of the molecular mechanism by which IL-2 message was generated, we showed that a fibronectin-VLA-5 fibronectin receptor interaction may contribute an independent signal distinct from the CD3 pathway of activation by the induction of an AP-1 transcriptional factor. Thus the VLA-5 fibronectin receptor on CD4 cells can play a complementary role in CD3-TCR-mediated signal transduction through its interaction with fibronectin.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune disease induced in susceptible animals by active immunization with human or bovine retinal S-Ag or by passive transfer of activated S-Ag or peptide-specific CD4+ T cells. During the course of studies aimed at the identification of T cell and B cell recognition sites in bovine and human S-Ag, a new potent uveitogenic region, located near the carboxy terminus of the molecule, was identified and characterized. Analysis of several synthetic peptides from this region showed that a 14 amino acid residue peptide, BSAg339-352, was highly uveitogenic when injected with adjuvants into Lewis rats. A uveitogenic T cell line, R737, was raised by in vitro selection of lymphocytes from animals immunized with peptide BSAg333-352. Northern blot analysis of mRNA from the R737 T cell line was positive for the rat homologs of murine V beta 8 and V alpha 2 T cell receptor gene probes. Whereas peptide BSAg339-352 defined the pathogenic site, nonpathogenic, proliferative sites were found in close physical association. This region is immediately adjacent to previously characterized pathogenic and proliferative sites contained in residues BSAg352-364. These results, as well as our previous observations, show S-Ag to be a complex molecule with several highly conserved amino acid sequences that can elicit pathogenic T cells with restricted T cell receptor V gene usage capable of active and passive elicitation of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis.\r"

  ".W": "Localization of streptococcal cell wall Ag (SCW) in the synovial tissue of treated rats induces an influx of leukocytes and a cell-mediated immune response leading to arthritis and joint destruction. Systemic administration of the T cell product, IFN-gamma (10(6) U/kg/day), suppresses the recruitment of leukocytes into the synovium and effectively inhibits the inflammation and pathology characteristic of SCW-induced arthritis (articular index 10.4 +/- 0.6 for SCW vs 2.0 +/- 0.7 for SCW with IFN-gamma, p less than 0.005). Monocyte-macrophages from animals treated with IFN-gamma exhibited defective chemotactic responses when tested in vitro and furthermore, monocytes cultured with IFN-gamma (25 to 500 U/ml) in vitro had significantly suppressed chemotactic responses to the complement fragment C5a (p less than 0.005). The decreased ability to migrate to C5a was associated with decreased binding of fluorochrome-conjugated C5a indicative of reduced expression of C5a receptors. Based on these data, IFN-gamma that induces monocyte maturation as reflected by increased Ia expression conversely inhibits C5a receptor expression. Although locally elevated IFN-gamma levels may serve to inhibit recruitment away from an inflammatory site, systemic exposure to IFN-gamma appears to inhibit leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site by its ability to induce premature maturation and concomitant inability to respond to certain chemotactic ligands. Inasmuch as monocyte recruitment to the synovium is pivotal in the development of SCW-induced polyarthritis, the ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit this event effectively inhibits the synovial pathology.\r"

Simultaneously, our own experiences are presented for 57 patients (phase II study) suffering from genital warts (21 patients), psoriatic arthritis (10 patients), psoriasis vulgaris (three patients), malignant melanoma (six patients), bowenoid papulosis (four patients), Behcet's disease (four patients), basal cell carcinoma (six patients), as well as herpes simplex recidivans, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and mycosis fungoides (one patient each). We conclude that there might be an indication for treatment with rIFN-gamma in genital warts, bowenoid papulosis, Behcet's disease, and microbial infections, such as leprosy and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Even though there are reports of a limited beneficial effect of rIFN-gamma on arthritis and skin lesions in psoriasis, we failed to observe any in 10 patients. The main side effects in our low-dose study (50-100 micrograms/d) were mild fever (78%), fatigue (78%), and myalgia (65%). Laboratory tests revealed an increase in the serum triglyceride level, in particular, in psoriatic patients.\r"

We treated patients with 100 micrograms IFN gamma per subcutaneous injections, which were given daily for the first 2 weeks and then 3 times per week. The principal criterion for evaluation of therapeutic success on arthritis was improvement of the Ritchie joint pain index by at least 25% in the double-blind and 30% in the long-term study. In the double-blind study, the interferon arm was superior to the placebo arm with a statistically significant, one-side error probability of less than 5% in the chi-square test. In the long-term study, IFN gamma caused an improvement in a portion of patients in the first 3 months of therapy. No further improvement was observed after the third month, and patients classified as responders in the first months showed a deterioration of the disease by continuing treatment. The humoral inflammatory parameters did not normalize during therapy. Regression of the skin manifestations could not be observed. IFN gamma is evidently capable of inducing a psoriasis on the injection site. Investigations of IFN gamma serum levels, IFN antibodies, 2'-5' A synthetase levels in serum, and mononuclear blood cells and NK cell activity under long-term therapy showed no explanation for the loss of efficacy after 3 months treatment.\r"

Between October 1985 and August 1989, 48 patients with CA were treated with laser vaporization, and 27 were treated with laser vaporization followed by a series of intralesional interferon (IFN) alpha-2b injections. The patients in the IFN group were more likely to have perianal CA (44% vs 24%), had larger numbers of CA, and were more likely to have had previous treatment, including previous laser vaporization. The CA in the laser group were more likely to be on the penis alone (67% vs 45%) and had a longer mean duration. The laser-treated group experienced a 38.2% rate of recurrence or reinfection with a mean follow-up period of 13 weeks. The laser and IFN group had an 18.5% rate of recurrence or reinfection with the same follow-up. We conclude that intralesional injections of alpha-2b interferon following carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata substantially reduce the risk of recurrence or reinfection.\r"

An overall complete response was observed in 35% of these patients; the figure was significantly higher in those who did not have a visceral localization or opportunistic infections. Total lymphocyte count, CD4 lymphocyte count, and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly higher, and beta-2-microglobuline significantly lower, in the responders than in the non-responders. A multivariate analysis showed that localization of KS and CD4 count had independent predictive value, with an odds ratio of 35 for patients who had more than 300 CD4 cells at the onset of treatment versus those with less than 150. Patients whose initially negative p24 antigenemia remained negative during treatment had the highest frequency of complete response. Among patients with initially positive p24 antigenemia, those whose percentage decrease in antigenemia levels was greatest had a higher frequency of complete response. The cumulative probability of survival in responders was 62% at four years. These results demonstrate an anti-tumoral and anti-viral effect and prolonged survival in a group of patients whose initial immune parameters were relatively well preserved. However, these results do not permit us to conclude whether these well-responding patients were treated at the onset of illness, or whether their illness was naturally less evolutive.\r"

  ".U": "91079610\r", 
  ".W": "A range of potent immunoregulatory molecules termed cytokines has become available for the therapy of human melanoma. Among the cytokines, the interferons (IFN) have been examined in great depth for the therapy of melanoma. IFN are able to modulate host effector cell function, including the tumor cytolytic function of lymphocytes and monocytes. IFN also have the capacity to regulate the distribution of circulating immunoregulatory (T) lymphocytes and the expression of tumor cell surface antigens, as well as class I and II products of the major histocompatibility locus. These activities of the IFN have led to their early application for treatment of human melanoma. The empirical evidence that IFN alpha exerts clinically significant anti-tumor effects against melanoma is reviewed, and evolving status of adjuvant trials of IFN alpha and gamma is noted. New indirect host-mediated anti-tumor activities that may potentially be manifest by IFN have yet to be fully harnessed. The opportunity to obtain meaningful anti-tumor activity in advanced disease or adjuvant settings, at dose ranges below those which are toxic (conventional maximal tolerable), are at hand. The U.S. cooperative groups [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), and South West Oncology Group (SWOG)] are studying IFN gamma in pursuit of this goal in advanced and adjuvant settings for melanoma and other tumors. The determination of the clinical role of IFN as biologic response modifiers demands equal commitment to the clinical assessment of immunobiologic mechanisms and anti-tumor effects. The immunologic assessment of IFN and a number of other cytokines is a major focus of the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. Regional delivery of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) may be the most appropriate and least toxic approach, given their half-life. Regional therapy by the intralesional route has yielded enhanced activity for a range of biologics, including bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Intralymphatic therapy with methanol extraction residue of BCG (MER-BCG) has been tested, and trials are now in progress with IL-2 to assess the optimal dosage by this route. It is likely that the optimal role of IFN and other cytokines will be found in combination with one another, and with different biologic modalities such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, to allow expansion and heightened activity of the desired effector cell populations in the host. Enhanced host toxicities, as well as anti-tumor effects, may require that special attention be devoted to optimal sequence of administration to enhance the therapeutic index.\r"

The objective regression rates were as follows: A, 23%; B, 20%; C, 23%; D, 10%; E, 5%; F, 7%; G, 0%. Despite the higher response rate from regimen A, there appeared to be no survival advantage from any of these programs. The median time to progression was 1 month with a median survival time of 6 months. Most regressions involved soft tissue disease, were partial, and occurred within 2-3 months of treatment. Four patients received IFN for approximately 6 months and have manifested extraordinarily durable regressions of greater than 4+ years. The alpha-regimens produced a flu-type illness and anorexia which were dose-related. Leukopenia was most noteworthy with regimens containing gamma-interferon. Ongoing trials involving alternative and improved immune-related modalities are awaited with keen interest.\r"

APAAP immunocytochemistry was performed using monoclonal antibodies against HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and ICAM-1. TNF did not markedly inhibit the growth of HDMEC but induced expression of HLA-DR (1,000 U/ml and more) and of ICAM-1 (1 U/ml and more). Combination with interferon-gamma led to synergistic ICAM-1 induction.

In all experiments IFN beta exhibited the most potent antiproliferative effect of all IFN tested. After 3 d of incubation a 50% growth inhibition was achieved with 20-40 IU/ml for natural IFN beta and with 600-1200 U/ml for recombinant IFN gamma. Substantially higher doses (7,000 to more than 50,000 IU/ml) of recombinant IFN alpha 2a were required to achieve a 50% growth inhibition. A strong synergistic antiproliferative activity resulted from the combination of IFN alpha with IFN gamma and IFN beta with IFN gamma. None of the IFN tested induced terminal differentiation of melanoma cells in vitro. The formation of dendrites was inhibited, and the portion of differentiated cells in vitro was reduced after treatment with IFN in comparison to the untreated controls (untreated controls: 100%; portion of differentiated cells after treatment with IFN alpha: 58%-74%, IFN beta: 48%-96%, IFN gamma: 10%-33%). The melanin synthesis was slightly elevated after treatment with IFN alpha (untreated controls: 100%; after treatment with IFN alpha: 103%-157%, ns.) and decreased significantly after treatment with IFN beta (49%-71%, p less than 0.05) as well as with IFN gamma (80%-88%, ns.). Cell surface markers were modulated varyingly by the IFN: HLA-I antigens were enhanced by all IFN, with IFN beta emerging as the most potent inducer. Only IFN gamma, however, induced a de novo expression of HLA-DR and -DQ antigens and increased the expression of the ICAM-1 molecule and of the melanoma progression marker A.1.43. Possibly, these findings indicate a biologically more aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells.\r"

Three of six melanoma cell lines elicited this intracellular human Mx-homolog upon incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, yet all six melanoma cell lines tested were susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma. Compared per antiviral unit, IFN-gamma had weaker Mx-inducing but stronger antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha. These data suggest that the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein is not involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN on malignant melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, 51 patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated thrice weekly with 10 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2b and 6 x 10(6) nIFN-alpha, respectively. Nine of the 51 patients experienced systemic objective tumor responses (3 complete response, 6 partial response), but had Mx concentrations in their mononuclear cells equal to the Mx levels of non-responders during IFN-alpha therapy. Therefore, the level of Mx-homologous protein induced during IFN therapy is not a predictive marker for an antitumor response in malignant melanoma.\r"

This system appeared to be well suited for examining the effects of vasoactive substances such as the TNF and INF-gamma on capillary growth. TNF-alpha,beta, and IFN-gamma not only significantly inhibited capillary growth induced by Mf, but also blocked capillary development induced by fibroblast growth factors (FGF), well-known potent angiogenic factors. Recently, we have found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) enhances in vitro capillary formation, probably at least in part by acting on Mf. Just as with FGF, capillary growth in the presence of PDGF was almost completely blocked by IFN-gamma. We examined the mode by which IFN-gamma inhibits angiogenesis and found that IFN-gamma inhibits both the proliferation of endothelial cells and collagen(s) synthesis by Mf. These actions of TNF or IFN-gamma could limit vascular formation in solid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "In 1983, a gonococcal pilus vaccine failed to show protection in a large, placebo-controlled, double-blind field trial. The epitopic response to this vaccine was investigated in a random subgroup of 20 vaccine recipients. Using Western blot analysis of the immunizing pilus and its cyanogen bromide (CNBr) fragments, IgG antibody to pilin was detected before immunization in all individuals. Preexistent antibody to the CNBr-2 and CNBr-3 fragments of pilin was detected in 65% and 5% of individuals, respectively. Pilus immunization resulted in a vigorous response to the CNBr-2 fragment in 100% of the individuals tested; only 33% developed antibody to the CNBr-3 fragment. Absorptions of postimmunization sera with different gonococcal strains resulted in either complete or partial removal of antibody to the CNBr-2 fragment. In the context of an unsuccessful vaccine trial, these results suggest that antibody to the CNBr-2 fragment of pilin may not be protective.\r"

Significant decreases (P less than .01) were seen in the levels of exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, phospholipase C, and pyochelin produced by the mucoid P. aeruginosa PAO rat lung isolates that returned to parental levels after reversion to the nonmucoid phenotype. In addition, lipopolysaccharide of the mucoid PAO lung isolates failed to react with serotype B-specific antibody in contrast to the original PAO and the revertant PAO organisms. Digestion of chromosomal DNA and hybridization with P. aeruginosa virulence factor-specific probes demonstrated that conversion to the mucoid phenotype was associated with rearrangement of chromosomal DNA upstream of the exotoxin A gene. Analysis of DNA from revertant organisms revealed hybridization patterns identical to the original PAO organism.\r"

  ".W": "The report of a major triglycosyl phenol phthiocerol (phenolic) glycolipid in some strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that resembles the phenolic glycolipid I of Mycobacterium leprae raised the prospects of a specific serodiagnostic tool for human tuberculosis. The terminal diglycosyl unit of the M. tuberculosis product was synthesized and converted to a corresponding neoglycoprotein, the O-(2,3,4-tri-O-methyl-alpha-L-fucopyranosyl)-(1----3)-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosyl)-(1----9)-oxynonanoyl-bovine serum albumin, and applied, in ELISA, to sera from individuals with tuberculosis. Although the correlation coefficient between the synthetic product and the native glycolipid was excellent, the seroreactivity rate of tuberculous sera was disappointing; only 24 of 119 sera from tuberculosis patients showed evidence of anti-glycolipid antibodies. In isolates of M. tuberculosis from tuberculosis patients the glycolipid was present in only 1 of 11. A partially deglycosylated version was present in two other isolates; however, most isolates lacked the glycolipid. Accordingly, while the results, unlike those of others, do not portend a future for this form of serodiagnosis in the management of tuberculosis, they offer intriguing hints as to the basis of the variable immunogenicity and pathogenicity of strains of M. tuberculosis.\r"

Similarly, within six short-term exposures (4 hours) to the same drugs, a high degree of resistance developed in the cells. Alternating 4-hour treatment cycles with MTX and TMTX did not delay the onset of resistance to these antimetabolites in the HCT-8 cells. The same strategy produced no better results than giving either MTX or TMTX alone to (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice bearing murine leukemia P388 cells. Furthermore, HCT-8 cells resistant to short-term (4-hour) exposure to MTX were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 7 days continuously, and cells resistant to MTX given continuously for 7 days were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 4 hours. Analogous results were obtained with TMTX, indicating that, under these circumstances, changing the schedule of administration of the same agent does not overcome resistance to it. The clinical relevance of these data to prolonged adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as loco-regional and continuous-infusion chemotherapy, is discussed.\r"

In a chronic sheep model, we have evaluated the flow through the bronchial artery after airway injury caused by the aspiration of 2.5 ml/kg of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid with and without inhibition of thromboxane synthetase and cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with ibuprofen resulted in no rise in bronchial artery blood flow associated with airway acid aspiration (9.8 +/- 1.72 ml/min to 63.7 +/- 8.9 ml/min in the control group versus 11.3 +/- 2.5 ml/min to 10.3 +/- 3.4 ml/min in the ibuprofen group). No difference in bronchial artery blood flow was noted between control acid aspiration and acid aspiration with thromboxane synthetase inhibition. Significant early reduction in lung lymph flow was noted in the cyclooxygenase inhibition group compared to control. These data suggest that inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway of eicosanoid production may lessen the injury caused by airway acid aspiration. The decrease in airway blood flow with associated reduction in lymph flow suggests that airway blood flow may be important in the generation of pulmonary edema in this model.\r"

  ".W": "The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial. Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management. We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days). Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases. In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management. Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected. We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered. This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management.\r"

A 4-year-old child deafened by meningitis at age 20 months had bilateral cochlear ossification by computed tomography. At surgery, a canal wall-down mastoidectomy and closure of the ear canal were performed. A trough around the modiolus was drilled, and the electrode array was placed in it. Post-operatively, the patient gave aversive or no responses to electrode stimulation. To assess electrode function, auditory brainstem responses to individual electrode activation were obtained under general anesthesia. Functioning electrodes could thus be selected for mapping. The patient now responds well to sound.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin-1 was initially identified as a 21-residue potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced by vascular endothelial cells, but was subsequently found to have many effects on both vascular and non-vascular tissues. The discovery of three isopeptides of the endothelin family, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, each possessing a diverse set of pharmacological activities of different potency, suggested the existence of several different endothelin receptor subtypes. Endothelins may elicit biological responses by various signal-transduction mechanisms, including the G protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C and the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Thus, different subtypes of the endothelin receptor may use different signal-transduction mechanisms. Here we report the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding one subtype belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA express specific and high-affinity binding sites for endothelins, responding to binding by the production of inositol phosphates and a transient increase in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+. The three endothelin isopeptides are roughly equipotent in displacing 125I-labelled ET-1 binding and causing Ca2+ mobilization. A messenger RNA corresponding to the cDNA is detected in many rat tissues including the brain, kidney and lung but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that this cDNA encodes a 'nonselective' subtype of the receptor which is different from the vascular smooth muscle receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Homozygous Gunn rats lack bilirubin glucuronyltransferase, become jaundiced, and often develop kernicterus, thus providing a model for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Two new, inbred rat strains that carry the Gunn mutation are described. These were developed by breeding the mutant Gunn gene (j) into the RHA/N and ACI/N strains, producing the new lines, which were designated RHA/N-j and ACI/N-j. Liver assay confirmed the absence of transferase activity in jaundiced rats from both of the new strains, but marked differences in mortality between the strains were observed. The mortality of jaundiced RHA/N-j rats through 8 weeks was the same as that of their nonjaundiced littermates (20%). In contrast, mortality of jaundiced ACI/N-j rats was distinctly greater than that of their nonjaundiced littermates (81% vs 34%, P less than .001). Signs of kernicterus such as ataxia were much more frequent in jaundiced ACI/N-j rats than in jaundiced RHA/N-j rats (73% vs 11%, P less than .001). Both strains had comparable albumin concentrations through 8 weeks of age. Serum bilirubin concentrations were also comparable, except for a small but significant difference at 20 days of age (ACI/N-j = 294 mumols/L, RHA/N-j = 248 mumols/L, P less than .01). Similarly, the bilirubin-to-albumin ratios were comparable except for a significantly higher ratio at 20 days of age in the ACI/N-j rats (ACI/N-j = 0.70, RHA/N-j = 0.51, P less than .01). Thus, the RHA/N-j strain is unusual in that the jaundiced animals remain healthy. Conversely, the ACI/N-j animals demonstrate a high incidence of kernicterus with mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Postpartum interviews with 1,484 primarily low-income women were conducted during 1987-88 in three areas of Missouri with the highest rates of inadequate prenatal care. The purpose of the study was to identify barriers to prenatal care and to determine which barriers differentiated between women receiving adequate and those receiving inadequate prenatal care. Women who received inadequate prenatal care were more likely to be black, unmarried, higher parity, and have less education than those who received adequate care. These women were also more likely to be poor, Medicaid-eligible, to have had an unwanted pregnancy, more stress and problems during pregnancy, and less social support. In the multivariate analysis, race and marital status lost their importance. The strongest predictor of inadequate prenatal care was women not knowing that they were pregnant in the first 4 months of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio 9.28). To improve the rate of adequate prenatal care, society must address the issues of poverty and wantedness of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Abortion rates rose following the expanded legalization of abortion by the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. As a result, the impact of the restriction on Federal funding of abortions under the Hyde Amendment in 1977 was not clear. However, abortion rates had plateaued by 1985, when State funding of Medicaid abortions was restricted in Colorado, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Analysis of statewide data from the three States indicated that following restrictions on State funding of abortions, the proportion of reported pregnancies resulting in births, rather than in abortions, increased in all three States. In 1985, the first year of State restrictions on the use of public funds for abortion, Colorado, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania recorded 1.9 to 2.4 percent increases in the proportion of reported pregnancies resulting in live births, after years of declining rates. With adjustments for underreporting of abortion, there was an overall 1.2 percent rise in the proportion of pregnancies resulting in live births in those States. Nationally the proportion rose only 0.4 percent. By 1987, the three States had experienced increases above 1984 levels of 1.6 to 5.9 percent in the proportion of reported pregnancies resulting in live births. The experiences of the three States can be used in projecting an expected increase in the proportions of reported pregnancies resulting in live births, rather than in abortions, for similar States. A projection for California, for example, showed that an increase could be expected in the first year of restrictions on the use of public funds for abortion of at least 4,000 births, which could be expected largely to affect women of low income.\r"

Overall, 99 specimens were positive on two enzyme-linked immunoassays and on Western blot, providing a seroprevalence rate of 0.32 percent. The rate for child-bearing women residing within the City of Baltimore, 0.7 percent, was significantly higher than the rate for those residing elsewhere in Maryland, 0.1 percent. The statewide rate for nonwhite women, 0.8 percent, was higher than for white women, 0.007 percent.

The program included case finding and outreach, coordination of maternal and child health services locally as well as interstate, and innovative health education programming. Data were collected on the health status of 359 pregnant migrant farmworker women and 560 children, ages birth to 5 years, the majority of Mexican descent, who received primary care services at the center. The mean age of the women was 23.1 years and their mean gravidity was 2.9. Dietary assessments showed that the protein intakes of most met or exceeded the U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances, but their consumption of foods in the milk-dairy group and the fruit-vegetable group was below recommended standards. Low hematocrit was a common problem among the women (43 percent) and, to a lesser extent, among the children (26 percent). Among the infants and children, 18 percent were obese. Black American women had the highest proportion of low birth weight infants. The project emphasized coordinated services for migrant farmworker mothers and children, such as transportation services, language translation, followup, and advocacy. An outreach strategy involved case finding, home visits, and services by lay health advisors. By the third year of the project, there were increases in the average number of prenatal visits, the proportion of women entering prenatal care in their first trimester, and in the use of well-child services.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This article describes the first attempt to measure the extent of this use by border residents. It also compares factors associated with their use of health care services in both the United States and Mexico. Data were obtained from a household survey conducted in Tijuana, Mexico, near the California border, using a random, stratified analytic sample of 660 households that included a total of 2,954 persons. The dependent variables--extent and volume of contacts with health professionals--were examined according to sociodemographic characteristics, insurance coverage, payment modality, type of visit, and health care setting. The results indicate that 40.3 percent of the Tijuana population used health services exclusively in Mexico during a 6-month period, compared with only 2.5 percent who used services in the United States. Of the Mexican users of U.S. services, the largest proportion appeared to be older people, lawful permanent residents or citizens of the United States who are living in Mexico, and persons from high- or middle-income sectors. In addition to the low level of use of U.S. health services, the findings show that more than 84 percent of the visits were to providers in the private sector and, for 59 percent of the visits, a fee for services was implied. Overall, this border population does not seem to be a drain on the U.S. public health system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the goal of reducing the prevalence of elevated blood cholesterol in the United States, the NCEP aims to raise awareness and understanding in both health professionals and the general public of high blood cholesterol levels as a risk factor for coronary heart disease. Public interest in blood cholesterol measurement has created an enormous market for cholesterol screening and education programs. The importance of quality screening and educational services was recognized by the NCEP, which has urged the training of all personnel involved in public cholesterol screenings. This paper presents models for training lay volunteers and health professionals to deliver quality public screening programs for high blood cholesterol that are consistent with NCEP recommendations. Blood cholesterol screening, counseling, and referral (SCORE) programs are key intervention strategies of the Pawtucket Heart Health Program (PHHP), a cardiovascular disease prevention research program in Pawtucket, RI. This paper describes the PHHP volunteer training and certification program for cholesterol SCOREs and the demographics of screening volunteers. With the goal of improving the quality of cholesterol screening and education programs nationally, the Cholesterol Training Center (CTC) was established in 1988. Using models established by PHHP, the center developed training workshops to help health professionals initiate, update, expand, or enhance training for cholesterol screening and education programs. CTC training protocols and the characteristics of workshop participants are described, and the workshops' effects on participants' knowledge and self-sufficiency are discussed.\r"

In the decade of the 1980s, EIS underwent dramatic changes in response to the increased breadth of the CDC mission and the rapid expansion of epidemiologic methods. Modifications in the experience of an EIS Officer have resulted from the increased need for more sophisticated analytic methods and the use of microcomputers, as well as CDC's expanded mission into chronic diseases, environmental health, occupational health, and injury control. Officers who have entered the EIS in the past decade tend to be older than their predecessors, tend to enter the program with more experience and training in epidemiology, and are more likely to stay in public health either at the Federal level or in State and local health departments. The EIS Program continues to be a critical source for men and women to respond to the need and demand for epidemiologic services both domestically and internationally.\r"

The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) of the CDC is an ongoing program that gives physicians and other health professionals opportunities to learn and practice epidemiology. In the period 1946-87, EIS Officers and other professional staff based at CDC headquarters participated in 2,900 epidemiologic field investigations requested by State, local, and international public health agencies. Nearly two-thirds of the investigations involved infectious disease problems, while 13 percent involved noninfectious conditions; for 21.1 percent, the etiology of the problem was unknown when the investigation was initiated. Among the specific subcategories, bacterial causes were the most common, accounting for 864 (29.8 percent) of all investigations. During this 41-year period, an increasing proportion of the field epidemiologic investigations involved public health problems of noninfectious etiology. Trends in the types of investigations done probably represent the influence of such factors as CDC's priorities, organizational structure, and budget; the size of the EIS Program; national health initiatives; and the States' needs and programs.\r"

The presence of a program was associated with hospital size (60 percent of those with 100 beds, 75 percent with 100-499 beds, 90 percent with 500 or more beds; P = 0.0013) and hospital location (urban 86 percent; rural 57 percent; P less than 0.001). The frequency of needlestick exposures per month among hospital personnel and hospital location were directly related to and best predicted the existence of hepatitis B vaccination programs. All hospitals with programs offered vaccine to high-risk personnel (as defined by the hospital). Seventy-seven percent of hospitals paid all costs for vaccinating high-risk personnel; 19 percent paid for any employee to be vaccinated regardless of risk status. Forty-six percent of hospitals with programs were estimated to have vaccinated more than 10 percent of all eligible personnel, and 13 percent to have vaccinated more than 25 percent of eligible personnel. The highest compliance rates were associated with hospitals paying for the vaccine and requiring vaccination of high-risk personnel. Fifty-four percent of hospitals attributed noncompliance to concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness. The reasons why there was no vaccination program in 58 hospitals were (a) low incidence of hepatitis B virus infections among personnel, (b) cost of vaccine, and (c) vaccination being offered as part of a needlestick protocol. Full utilization of hepatitis B vaccine could eliminate the occupational hazard that hepatitis B virus presents to health care personnel.\r"

Data on age, sex, and living arrangements for the 4,485 eligible people were analyzed with respect to final participation status and reason for refusal or reluctance. The health and social status of reluctant and ready self-respondents were compared, and respondents-by-proxy were compared with self-respondents. Total participation rates were similar for both sexes and all ages, but the likelihood of interview by proxy increased with age, as did the likelihood of nonparticipation due to unavailability. Living alone or with other participants favored participation, and living with refusers or other nonrespondents increased the probability of refusal. While reluctant and ready self-respondents differed in only one health variable and two social variables, respondents-by-proxy differed from self-respondents in most variables tested. These analyses suggest an absence of major differences between self-respondents and refusers. Therefore, nonresponse bias is not likely to have a major impact on interpretation of the data obtained from participants in this study.\r"

The smoking ban was implemented at 11 work sites at various times during 1985-86. All work sites had three or more pre-ban surveys and one or two post-ban surveys. The majority of employees reported support for the smoking ban. The ban's effects were assessed by comparing observed post-ban rates with expected rates projected from secular trends in the pre-ban data by the use of logistic regression models that included age, sex, education, and job class as covariates. The work site smoking ban had a substantial effect on the presence of smoke in the work environment, but no short-term effect on smoking prevalence or attempts to quit. The apparent effect of the ban on quantity of cigarettes smoked was assessed by a pre-ban and post-ban analysis of the 1986-87 survey data. A nonequivalent post-ban and post-ban comparison was used to estimate the secular trend. A significant reduction of 1.4 cigarettes per day (P = 0.022) was found in smokers' rate during working hours.\r"

Most adults (83 percent) had seen or heard public service announcements about AIDS in the month prior to interview, and 51 percent had read an AIDS brochure in the past. Sixty-seven percent of adults responded correctly to at least 10 of 14 general AIDS knowledge questions. Knowledge levels were higher among those who were more educated and those who had seen or heard public service announcements or had read brochures. White adults responded correctly to these questions more often than their black counterparts; non-Hispanics responded correctly more often than Hispanics (for statistical purposes, the population is divided twice, in the first instance racially and in the second, ethnically--white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic). Even with relatively high information levels, misperceptions about casual transmission persisted, with one-third of adults answering more than half of the questions about casual transmission incorrectly. The same population groups that had less general AIDS knowledge had more misperceptions about transmission. More than 80 percent of adults recognized that use of condoms and a monogamous relationship between two uninfected persons were effective means of preventing the spread of the AIDS virus. Seventy-four percent of adults had heard of the HIV antibody test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A key element in the study of trauma problems is the design and development of adequate and affordable surveillance systems. One proposed method is the use of data available from hospital discharge abstract data base systems. However, surveillance systems based on existing data bases usually do not include codes that can identify the external causes of injuries, a critical limitation of the ability to determine the mechanisms of injuries. One obstacle to adding external cause of injury codes, known as E codes under the International Classification of Diseases, to uniform hospital discharge abstract data base systems is the cost of such a change. This study provided an estimate of the type and size of the costs for one State, based upon a survey of hospitals, information system vendors, and medical records experts. Two categories of the costs involved in adding E codes to hospital discharge abstract data base systems were identified. One-time implementation costs, which include modification of the computerized data base and the coding guidelines used by medical record personnel, average $600 per hospital. Annual costs resulting from increased operating expenses to include E codes average about $600 per hospital, because of the increased workload of coding and entry of the additional data. Adding E codes to hospital discharge abstract data base systems appears to be financially feasible for statewide surveillance of serious injury.\r"

  ".W": "The use of condoms has been advocated as an important method of reducing the risk of AIDS for such people as gay men, prostitutes, IV drug users, adolescents, hemophiliacs, and others who may become infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Although AIDS risk-reduction programs have provided information on condoms, none has assessed baseline or followup skills in their use. Because most condom failures have been attributed to errors in use, promoters of condom use should determine whether they are used correctly among those persons targeted for education. A total of 219 gay men entering an AIDS risk-reduction program were asked to demonstrate the use of condoms on a model. All errors made during the demonstration were corrected, and participants were trained during the exercise in the proper use of condoms. More than 80 percent required correction in such things as opening the package, determining the outside of the condom, unrolling the condom to the base of the penis, and expressing air from the space at the tip of the penis. Although proper use of condoms may seem obvious, this small study demonstrates that it must be taught. Since instructions found in condom packaging frequently are not easily understood by potential users, explicit instructions for condom use are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Overdistraction and derotation of the scoliotic spine during surgery represent potential complications that could lead to spinal cord dysfunction and paralysis. Neuronal loss and, consequently, the inability to regain function may be attributable to primary damage (eg, mechanical), secondary cell death (eg, such as that produced by ischemia) or a combination of both. Beyond intraoperative recognition and removal of the rods, effective strategies to prevent this neuronal loss have yet to be developed. This emphasizes the need for a clearer understanding of the molecular events that contribute to neuronal injury in the central nervous system. Considerable evidence has indicated that the excitatory transmitter L-glutamate and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitatory amino acid receptor may contribute to the secondary neuronal death observed in a wide variety of neurological insults, including ischemia. The current investigation was undertaken to elucidate the potential role of the NMDA receptor in spinal cord pathology. Isolated rat spinal cords were exposed to anoxic physiologic solutions in the presence and absence of Ca++, NMDA receptor agonists, and a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The extent of neuronal damage was assessed by quantitating the degradation of the cytoskeletal neurofilament protein. A substantial increase in the loss of neurofilament protein was observed in spinal cords exposed to anoxic conditions in the presence of Ca++ as compared with the absence of Ca++. Exposure to excitatory amino acid agonists (L-glutamate or NMDA) further potentiated the degradation of the neurofilament protein; an effect that was reversed by a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Serving as a reproducible human trauma model, patients (n = 21) undergoing elective cholecystectomy received postoperative total parenteral nutrition with (n = 9) or without (n = 12) alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) supplementation. Skeletal muscle biopsy specimens were taken before surgery and on the third postoperative day. The postoperative decreases in the concentrations of free glutamine and basic amino acids seen in the control group were counteracted in the AKG group (p less than 0.05). Muscle protein synthesis was estimated by ribosome analysis. On the third postoperative day the control group showed a decline in the polyribosome concentration (25.8% +/- 4.5%; p less than 0.001). No significant change was observed in the AKG group. On each postoperative day the nitrogen balance was negative in the control group but not in the AKG group. In the control group the cumulative nitrogen balance amounted to -9.9 +/- 1.8 gm of nitrogen and in the AKG group -2.6 +/- 2.6 gm of nitrogen, which was significantly different (p less than 0.05). Administration of AKG, the carbon skeleton corresponding to glutamine, produced results similar to those seen when glutamine is added to postoperative total parental nutrition. The results suggest that the availability of precursors for glutamine synthesis in skeletal muscle is crucial for the degree of muscle protein catabolism after surgical trauma.\r"
