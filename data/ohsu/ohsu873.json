Primary hypercoagulable states are those conditions associated with an increased risk of thrombosis caused by a specific measurable defect in the proteins of coagulation and/or fibrinolytic systems. These disorders are frequently inherited and include deficiencies of antithrombin III, heparin cofactor 2, protein C, protein S, abnormal fibrinolytic activity, dysfibrinogenemia, and Hageman trait. Patients with a lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody syndrome with thrombotic episodes are also considered to have a primary hypercoagulable state. The physiology, pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of primary hypercoagulable states are reviewed.\r"

The natural hard bristle toothbrush and vigorous scrub brushing popular a generation ago have been replaced by soft bristle nylon brushes and gentler, more defined brushing procedures for plaque removal in the crevicular areas. Quantitative studies support the superiority of the current techniques in maintaining periodontal health with less trauma to the oral tissues.\r"

Challenges were performed either (1) continuously for 6 hours or (2) in an intermittent fashion that is, Ag or C for the first hour, buffer for the next 4 hours, and then Ag or C during the sixth hour. Fluids in the overlying chamber were assayed for levels of the mast cell components, histamine and tryptase. There was peak release of both histamine and tryptase during the first hour of Ag incubation (89 +/- 11 ng/ml and 1428 +/- 260 ng/ml, respectively). At continuous Ag-challenge sites, there was a plateau of histamine levels (8.0 to 9.5 ng/ml) during the next 4 hours, whereas tryptase levels decreased progressively to baseline levels. Challenge of continuous Ag-incubation sites with C, a mast cell activator, led to another peak release of both histamine and tryptase. At interrupted Ag-challenge sites, histamine levels decreased abruptly, and tryptase levels decreased progressively after the first hour. Rechallenge of such sites with Ag during the sixth hour induced a peak release of histamine but no increase in tryptase levels. Continuous challenge with C for up to 5 hours in other sites induced an initial peak histamine release without a subsequent plateau. However, such a plateau of histamine (but not tryptase) release occurred after an initial C challenge if Ag was subsequently incubated in a continuous fashion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Allergenic cross-reactivity among six basidiomycete species (Calvatia cyathiformis, Coprinus quadrifidus, Psilocybe cubensis, Pleurotus ostreatus, Ganoderma meredithae, and Pisolithus tinctorius) was determined by immunoprint inhibition. Extensive cross-reactivity was demonstrated among Coprinus quadrifidus, Psilocybe cubensis, and Pleurotus ostreatus of the order Agaricales, and Calvatia cyathiformis of the order Lycoperdales. However, G. meredithae (order Aphyllophorales) and Pisolithus tinctorius (order Sclerodermatales) did not demonstrate significant cross-reactivity with the other basidiomycete species. Generally, the two most potent inhibitors were Psilocybe cubensis and Pleurotus ostreatus. Inhibitory dose-response curves of a major allergenic band (isoelectric point, 9.3) were obtained by densitometry. Significant cross-reactivity was demonstrated for the 9.3 band among the species of the order Agaricales and with Calvatia cyathiformis. The most potent inhibitors were again Psilocybe cubensis and Pleurotus ostreatus. Thus, there is substantial allergenic cross-reactivity among the species of the order Agaricales tested and with Calvatia cyathiformis but not between these four species and G. meredithae or Pisolithus tinctorius. These studies support earlier RAST-inhibition observations of shared allergenic epitopes among basidiomycetes, especially epitopes within the Agaricales. The presence of shared epitopes suggests the possibility of devising a panel of skin test reagents representative of a large group of basidiomycetes.\r"

Carnoy's fixed tissue sections were stained by a double immunohistochemical method using a biotinylated mouse monoclonal antichymase antibody with immunoperoxidase, followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antitryptase antibody. Epithelial mast cells (MCs) were found in all VC specimens (96% MCTCs) and in three GPC specimens (100% MCTCS) but in none of the other groups. In the substantia propria, MCTCS were the predominant type of MC observed in all specimens, accounting for 95% of the total MCs in the normal control group and 100% of the total MCs in the subjects with GPC, AC, and SCL. No significant differences were found in the total MC concentration of the substantia propria among the normal control subjects (11,054 +/- 6327 MCs per cubic millimeter), subjects in the SCL group (13,168 +/- 4685 MCs per cubic millimeter), subjects with GPC (17,313 +/- 8500 MCs per cubic millimeter), and subjects with AC (15,380 +/- 5660 MCs per cubic millimeter). In subjects with VC, the percentage of MCTs (18% +/- 13%) and the total MC concentration (24,689 +/- 18,978 MCs per cubic millimeter) in the substantia propria were significantly increased as compared to the normal control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Insulin resistance and symptoms of allergy appeared in this patient several months after initiating therapy with mixed beef-pork insulin, as is often the case. Symptoms initially improved, but persisted, and then worsened again, despite continuous human insulin therapy. Total insulin-binding capacity by Scatchard analysis, high plasma insulin-binding capacity, and specific anti-insulin antibody levels were consistent with an immunologic form of insulin resistance. Glucocorticoid therapy was required both to reduce allergic findings and to restore glycemic control. Although recently available human insulins may be less immunogenic than animal forms, immune responses to exogenous human insulin still may pose significant clinical problems.\r"

Among 12 rat-allergic volunteers, all had a nasal response during the exposure with an increase in nasal lavage histamine concentrations or TAME-esterase activity, but only five volunteers had a lower respiratory tract response (fall in FEV1 greater than 10%). Two of five allergic control subjects had a small change in nasal TAME-esterase activity, and none had a 10% fall in FEV1. A dose response was demonstrated between the allergen concentrations and the intensity of the nasal allergic response. This occupational challenge procedure thus was able to measure the nasal and lower respiratory tract response to airborne allergen exposure in a work environment. It can be used to define further the determinants of this response.\r"

Such scales can be used to screen patients who may then be referred on for psychiatric assessment. The validity of the Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90), a self-rating scale of general psychopathology widely used in the nongeriatric adult population, was explored in 44 older subjects. It was compared with the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric (SCAG) scale and a measure of functional disability, the London Psychogeriatric Rating Scale (LPRS). Caregivers to all subjects also rated the degree of difficulty experienced with their care on a four-point scale. Thirty of the subjects attended a geriatric day hospital, and the remaining 14 were waiting to go into long-term care facilities. Symptoms Checklist-90 was not significantly different between the two groups of subjects (day hospital and preinstitutional) after Bonferroni corrections, though SCAG scale and LPRS were (P less than .01 for both). Although SCL-90 was correlated significantly with the SCAG scale (r = .46), it was not significantly correlated with the LPRS. It showed good internal consistency but poor face validity and an inability to differentiate between levels of difficulty for the caregiver. It is concluded that the use of SCL-90 in older people may be limited because of the lack of sensitivity to functional disability and care difficulty. This nevertheless needs to be further explored, perhaps with some modification of the scale for older people.\r"

  ".W": "Several characteristics of nursing home care can diminish rather than enhance the clinical status of older residents. In view of evidence from other settings that \"interpersonal expectancy effects\" can influence outcomes in a variety of relations, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the effects of caregiver expectations on the clinical status of nursing home residents. Within 2 weeks of admission, 63 older residents at six nursing homes were given a comprehensive assessment of cognitive, functional, and emotional status. Residents were then randomly assigned to a \"high-expectancy\" or \"average-expectancy\" condition. Nurses and aides were told that, in comparison with other residents having similar problems, residents in the high-expectancy group were predicted to perform above average in their rehabilitation. The assessment was repeated 3 months later; information on the health and psychosocial status of residents was drawn from their medical records covering the same period. Aides reported having higher expectations for treatment group residents. When assessed by a blinded research assistant, residents in the high-expectancy group experienced greater relief of depressive symptoms but showed greater decrements in functional independence in comparison with control residents. Treatment group residents were admitted significantly less frequently to hospitals despite a comparable number of emergency ward visits, suggesting a lower incidence of severe illness despite comparable medical surveillance. There was also a trend toward improved performance in mental status testing among the high-expectancy residents compared with controls (P = .08). Additional research is needed to define further the magnitude and mechanisms of expectancy effects in relations between nursing home caregivers and residents.\r"

One of the main causes of the high risk of complications in emergency tracheostomy appears to be the amount of time required to open the trachea. Therefore, simple and fast procedures are mandatory. We have developed a new procedure as follows: A horizontal skin incision is performed. Strap muscles are dissected and retracted laterally. A transverse cut between tracheal rings below the thyroid isthmus is performed up to membranous portion of the trachea. The cut ends of the trachea remain open naturally because of the elasticity of the trachea. Skin and tracheal cut-ends are then joined by interrupted sutures. We have used this procedure during the past three years and have not experienced any major complications. This demonstrates the clear advantage and the more physiological nature of the procedure over various other incisions of the tracheal wall.\r"

Based on the neuropathological finding of whether or not many concomitant senile plaques (SPs) and/or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are present. DLBD is divided into two forms: a common form and a pure form. In the common form not only numerous Lewy bodies but also many SPs and/or NFTs are found in the cerebral cortex, whereas in the pure form there are no or few senile changes. Of the 37 cases, 28 cases had the common form, and 9 had the pure form of DLBD. In the common form all cases had shown progressive cortical dementia in the presenile or senile period. About 60% of the cases began with memory disturbance, while 25% showed Parkinson's or Shy-Drager syndrome initially. Parkinson's syndrome, consisting mainly of muscular rigidity and akinesia, was usually marked in the later stage, although there were also 8 cases (28.6%) in which no parkinsonian symptoms were detected even in the terminal stage. On the other hand, almost all cases with the pure form of DLBD showed juvenile Parkinson's syndrome, followed by progressive cortical dementia, although there was one presenile case with mild dementia and Parkinson's syndrome. These Japanese cases are compared with cases reported in Western countries.\r"

The clinical manifestations were cataracts, intellectual deterioration, ataxia, palatal and pharyngeal myoclonus, corticospinal tract damage and an electrophysiologically demonstrated sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity was slowed. Sural nerve biopsy revealed reduced densities of both myelinated and unmyelinated axons and teased fibres showed evidence of axonal regeneration and some remyelination. The loss of myelinated nerve fibres particularly affected those of larger diameter, thus contributing to the slowing of nerve conduction. Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment for two separate periods of 10 and 6 months each increased nerve conduction velocity. This electrophysiological improvement was not matched by detectable clinical neurological improvement.\r"

One is characterized by later age, less severe onset, longer symptom duration, less beta-cell disappearance after 12 months, more females; the other by earlier age, more sudden and severe onset, DR 3/4, earlier disappearance of beta-cell function and more males. RECPAM analysis provides further insight into the structure of the two clusters.

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that alternate-day administration of furosemide will result in a sustained improvement in pulmonary function without causing alterations in electrolyte or mineral homeostasis, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 11 hospitalized, oxygen-dependent, spontaneously breathing infants with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Infants were randomly selected to receive either furosemide, 4 mg/kg in two divided doses on alternate days orally, or placebo for 8 days, followed by crossover to the alternate-therapy for an additional 8-day period. The two study periods were separated by a 48-hour washout period. Dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, the concentration of electrolytes in serum, and the concentrations of calcium and creatinine in urine were measured on nontreatment days. Alternate-day furosemide therapy increased dynamic lung compliance by 76 +/- 112% and decreased total pulmonary resistance by 20 +/- 39%, compared with placebo (both variables p = 0.032). Alternate-day furosemide therapy did not result in increased urine output, electrolyte abnormalities, or increased urinary calcium excretion. We conclude that this simplified treatment regimen may be useful in the management of infants with chronic bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The results support our previous speculation that furosemide improves pulmonary function by mechanisms unrelated to its diuretic properties.\r"

A bedside microcomputer-based data acquisition system was used to monitor the duration of rest or the number of interventions per day. Infants assigned to receive reduced manipulation spent a significantly higher percentage of time each day at rest than did those who received standard manipulation (p less than 0.006). However, the incidence of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH did not differ significantly (30% in the study vs 37% in the standard manipulation group). When we analyzed the effect of manipulation in relation to risk of PV-IVH, while taking into account other perinatal variables, standard manipulation was not associated with increased risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH. However, low birth weight, maternal smoking, general anesthesia, early grade 1 PV-IVH, low hematocrit, lowest arterial oxygen pressure within the first 6 hours of life, and large base deficit at 6 hours of age all increased the relative risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH.\r"

All women were free of severe medical complications or drug therapy; cases of intrauterine growth retardation or premature rupture of the membranes were excluded. Their newborn infants, excluding malformed, congenitally infected, and growth-retarded infants, were enrolled in the study unless they had died before the age of 10 postnatal days. Babies born to group A mothers (n = 248) were further assigned to a treatment group (group A1, n = 130) receiving dexamethasone, 2 mg/kg/day by intravenous injection during the first 7 days of life, or to a control group (group A2, n = 118) receiving 10% dextrose solution placebo. Group B infants (prenatal betamethasone, n = 205) received neither treatment nor placebo. The incidence of NEC in group A1 was 6.9% (9/130), and in group A2 it was 14.4% (17/118) (p less than 0.05). In group B the incidence was 3.4% (7/205); this was much lower than in group A2 (p less than 0.01) and lower than in group A combined (10.4%) (p less than 0.01). There was no death from NEC and no surgical intervention among group B patients. The mortality rate for group A1 (11%) was lower than for group A2 (56%) (p less than 0.02). There were fewer indications for surgical intervention for NEC in group A1 than in group A2. Histologic studies confirmed bowel ischemia in all specimens analyzed. These data support the hypothesis that the incidence of NEC is significantly reduced after prenatal steroid treatment. Although postnatal therapy with steroids does not decrease the incidence as effectively as prenatal therapy, it improves clinical outcome of NEC.\r"

Many children who do not have classic GH deficiency may respond to GH therapy. These observations require rethinking of the medical indications for GH therapy, and raise two central ethical questions: (1) Is it justified to discriminate on the basis of GH deficiency? (2) Whatever the indication for GH treatment, at what height should GH therapy be considered an entitlement? We argue, first, that GH responsiveness, not GH deficiency, should be the criterion for GH treatment, and that prior arguments emphasizing GH deficiency are based on vague or faulty notions of disease, handicap, or potential. Second, we argue that children who are handicapped (arbitrarily defined as including those whose height is below the 1st percentile) and GH responsive are entitled to treatment. Children above that height, whether GH deficient or not, may permissibly be treated, but there is no societal obligation to do so. Such an approach would reduce, though not eliminate, some of the more severe burdens of short stature without aggravating the pernicious effects of \"heightism\" in American society.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effects of mild hypoglycemia on cognitive functioning in diabetic children, we used an insulin glucose clamp technique to induce and maintain a hypoglycemic state. Eleven patients, 11 to 18 years of age, completed a series of cognitive tests during a baseline euglycemic state (100 mg/dl (5.5 mmol/L] and repeated those measures at the beginning and end of a hypoglycemic plateau (55 to 65 mg/dl (3.1 to 3.6 mmol/L], and again at restoration of euglycemia. At plasma glucose levels of 60 to 65 mg/dl (3.3 to 3.6 mmol/L), a significant decline in mental efficiency was found. This was most apparent on measures of mental \"flexibility\" (Trial Making Test) and on measures that required planning and decision making, attention to detail, and rapid responding. Moreover, complete recovery of cognitive function was not contemporaneous with restoration of euglycemia, particularly on those tests requiring rapid responding and decision making (choice reaction time). Not all subjects showed evidence of cognitive impairment during hypoglycemia. The very high degree of intersubject variability suggests that, in addition to plasma glucose values, unknown physiologic variables are responsible for triggering cognitive impairments in school-aged youngsters with diabetes during an episode of mild hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that lowering glomerular pressure in children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus will reduce microalbuminuria and that this reduction may preserve renal function. We therefore conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial to compare 3 months of treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (0.9 mg/kg/day), and 3 months of placebo administration to 12 normotensive adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 11 with microalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of 15 to 200 micrograms/min) and one with early overt nephropathy. Mean age (+/- SD) was 14.4 +/- 1.7 years, and disease duration was 5.1 +/- 2.5 years. Albumin excretion rate decreased significantly during captopril therapy (baseline 78 +/- 114 micrograms/min; mean of monthly measurements 38 +/- 55 micrograms/min vs placebo 78 +/- 140 micrograms/min; p less than 0.001). During captopril therapy, albumin excretion was reduced by 41 +/- 44% and decreased in 10 of 12 subjects, but was unchanged in two, one with a borderline albumin excretion rate (16.3 micrograms/min) and one with diabetes of short duration (2.9 years). Plasma renin activity rose significantly during captopril therapy, and mean arterial pressure decreased slightly (placebo 81 +/- 7 mm Hg; captopril 76 +/- 5 mm Hg; p = 0.004). After 3 months of captopril treatment, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow did not change significantly. Hemoglobin Alc values remained stable during the study. The only side effect of captopril was diarrhea in one patient. We conclude that, in the short term, captopril is effective in decreasing albumin excretion rate in normotensive children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, without significant side effects. Longer trials are indicated in an attempt to delay or prevent overt nephropathy.\r"

Titer was expressed as the highest dilution of antibody giving definitive staining using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. Ras oncogene was expressed in 88.5% of the specimens. We did not find a significant correlation between ras expression and any of a variety of clinical and histopathologic prognostic parameters. Although patients' median survival after resection of specimens with ras oncogene expression was less than half the median survival after removal of tumors without such expression, this difference was not statistically significant. Further prospective investigations are needed to assess the role of ras oncogene evaluation in clinical practice.\r"

When the whole bulk of a malignant bone tumour fits the criteria laid down, the designation of MFH seems appropriate. Seven cases of MFH of bone were encountered from a total of 220 primary malignant bone tumours in our files over a 4-year period. The metaphyses of long bones were the most common sites harbouring the tumour, and a wide age range was represented. Amputation was the treatment of choice in all cases.

  ".W": "Cancer patients undergoing surgery often present with unusual and challenging problems. Their age and the fact that they are often chronically ill place them at increased surgical risk. In many instances the need for surgical intervention is crucial to the extent that risk-assessment becomes an academic issue, especially for those patients whose only reasonable chance for either cure or palliation of unbearable disease is surgery. However, the internist's role in these situations often has preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative ramifications. Preoperatively, the internist assesses operative risk and intervenes, when possible, to reduce the likelihood of surgical complications. Patients who clearly cannot survive surgery may be identified and channeled to other treatment modalities. Intraoperatively, the internist may be called upon to help with the management of acute organ failure, cardiac arrest, or vascular collapse. Following surgery, the internist may help by managing cardiopulmonary problems and treating infectious complications. The critical care internist is therefore an important member of the perioperative team and often provides valuable expertise, which can help to identify and treat problems expediently.\r"

The average percentage diameter stenosis regressed from 40.0 (SD 16.9)% to 37.8 (16.5)% in the experimental group yet progressed from 42.7 (15.5)% to 46.1 (18.5)% in the control group.

In contrast, little relation has been found between intake of preformed vitamin A and this disease. Although initial studies suggested that persons with lower levels of serum retinol have higher future rates of lung cancer, this idea was not confirmed in subsequent investigations. Prediagnostic levels of beta-carotene in blood, however, have been inversely related with risk of lung cancer. Available data thus strongly support the hypothesis that dietary carotenoids reduce the risk of lung cancer, but the data are also compatible with the possibility that some other factor in these foods is responsible for the lower risk. Even if ultimately shown to be casual, the relation between diet and lung cancer is modest compared with the deleterious effect of cigarette smoking.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the length of the post-augmentation period. The mean maximum dose of oxytocin was 11.1 mU/minute in the external tocography group and 11.0 mU/minute in the internal tocography group. Evidence of uterine hyperstimulation requiring temporary reduction of the oxytocin dose occurred in 19 and 20.2% of the patients in the external and internal tocography groups, respectively. Cesarean delivery was necessary in 12.6 and 16.9% of patients in the external and internal tocography groups, respectively, which is a nonsignificant difference. The incidence of low Apgar scores in the neonates and admission to neonatal intensive care was similar in both groups. The incidence of poor Apgar scores was not different between those who had transient hyperstimulation and those who had no hyperstimulation. In the management of augmented labor, monitoring of uterine contractions by intrauterine pressure catheters did not confer any advantage over tocography by external transducers.\r"

Among the first 201 examinations, cervical length was measured successfully in 99.5% of cases. This success rate compares favorably with those of abdominal sonography and vaginal sonography using the standard 90 degrees scanning angle sector probes. We also compared this method with digital examination in a double-blind fashion. Only a fair degree of association between sonographic cervical measurements and measurements obtained by digital examination was found, reflected in a correlation coefficient of 0.49.\r"

Maternal and fetal indices were recorded 15 minutes before dosing, immediately thereafter, and at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after the drug was given. No significant changes were found in either the maternal blood pressures or pulse rates. Blood flow velocities did not change significantly from baseline for the uterine arcuate artery, fetal aorta, or umbilical artery circulations. In no case did absolute blood flow velocity decrease significantly or systolic/diastolic ratios elevate to worrisome values.

  ".W": "Various methods have been used for the diagnosis of congenital fetal arrhythmias. Currently, M-mode echocardiography is the most widely used method. However, good tracings are often difficult to obtain because of unfavorable fetal positions, resulting in long durations of examination. In early gestation, the fetal heart is often too small for clear M-mode echocardiography. Doppler velocity waveforms of the fetal inferior vena cava represent the right atrial activity, whereas those of the aorta reflect ventricular contraction. Because of the proximity of the vessels, it is easy to obtain simultaneous recording in opposite channels of Doppler waveforms from both vessels. A visual relationship between the atrial and ventricular contractions may be clearly established and a diagnosis may be made. The findings of simultaneous pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the fetal aorta and inferior vena cava were assessed in different types of congenital fetal arrhythmia: congenital heart block, premature atrial ectopic contractions, premature ventricular ectopic contractions, and supraventricular tachycardia. The correct diagnosis was made as early as 13 weeks' gestation, showing the application of this method in early pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Bilateral renal agenesis is a fetal malformation incompatible with extrauterine life. Accurate prenatal diagnosis is essential for patient counseling. False-negative diagnoses have been reported and were attributed to the sonographic misidentification of apparently hypertrophied fetal adrenal glands as fetal kidneys. To study the relationship between renal agenesis and adrenal size, we reviewed autopsy records from 11 affected fetuses that had undergone careful autopsy and organ weight determination in our laboratory. Anomalies of distant structures were present in five affected fetuses. A sonographic diagnosis of adrenal hypertrophy had been made in two cases. In four of 11 fetuses, the glands had taken on a flattened discoid appearance. The autopsy records of 240 normal fetuses were similarly reviewed, and regression lines were generated for adrenal weight based on foot length and crown-rump length. The adrenal weights from affected fetuses were well within normal limits when compared with these normal regression lines and with organ weight standards from the literature. We conclude that adrenal hypertrophy is not a common finding in this syndrome and that the reported false-negative diagnoses are more likely attributable to a change in adrenal shape rather than a true increase in adrenal mass.\r"

  ".W": "Amniotic pressure was measured in 49 pregnancies with abnormal quantities of amniotic fluid. Among 17 with polyhydramnios, the pressure was always above the normal mean for gestation and exceeded the upper limit of normal in nine. In polyhydramnios, amniotic pressure correlated positively with the depth of the deepest pool (r = 0.65, P = .04) and negatively with fetal PO2 (r = -0.57, P = .03) and pH (r = -0.56, P = .04). Amniotic pressure was raised in all those with a deepest pool of greater than 15 cm, and was normal in all with a deepest pool less than 15 cm. Amniotic pressure fell significantly with drainage of amniotic fluid in those with raised pressure (mean 12.7 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 7.0-18.3; P = .002) but not in those with normal pressure (mean 0.3, 95% confidence interval -3.2 to +3.9; P = .82). Restoration of normal amniotic pressure in one pregnancy was accompanied by marked improvement in fetal acid-base status. Among 24 pregnancies with severe oligohydramnios, amniotic pressure was always below the normal mean, falling below the lower limit of normal in eight; whereas in another eight pregnancies with mild/moderate oligohydramnios, amniotic pressure was scattered evenly within the normal range. Amnioinfusion of 55-500 mL of normal saline in cases of severe oligohydramnios led to a significant rise in pressure (4.7 mmHg, 95% confidence interval 3.5-5.9; P less than .0001). We conclude that amniotic pressure is high in polyhydramnios and low in oligohydramnios. Pressure monitoring may be beneficial during amnioinfusion and therapeutic amniocentesis.\r"

We studied serial changes in maternal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 levels (measured by radioimmunoassay after acid ethanol extraction) throughout pregnancy in 22 normal women and in 38 with insulin-dependent diabetes. The diabetic women had significantly lower serum insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations than normal women throughout pregnancy and after delivery, although the rates of change in both groups of women were similar. Within-patient analysis showed a significant decrease in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 between 6-12 weeks' gestation and a significant increase between 24-32 weeks, followed by a significant decrease from 36 weeks' gestation to 12 weeks after delivery. Incremental changes in insulin-like growth factor 1 between 24-32 weeks' gestation correlated significantly with incremental changes in hPL (r = 0.40; P less than .001) and with birth weight (r = 0.37; P less than .01), but not with ultrasound measurements of fetal growth. The correlation of increments in insulin-like growth factor 1 and birth weight became nonsignificant when the association of hPL with both insulin-like growth factor 1 and birth weight was taken into account. Neither insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (placental protein 12) nor its ratio to insulin-like growth factor 1 showed any association with infant size. The physiologic changes in maternal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 in pregnant diabetic women do not appear related to the increased birth weight of their infants.\r"

Pelvic lymphoceles, ranging in volume from 46-300 mL, occurred in eight patients (22.2%) between the 12-24th postoperative day. Percutaneous catheter drainage, inserted under local anesthesia, was used for a mean time of 14.5 days (range 4-32), resulting in a mean daily drainage of 92.2 mL and a mean total volume of 1727.5 mL per patient. Catheter drainage allowed complete clinical and sonographic remission in all cases, and only one asymptomatic recurrence was observed at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage has proved to be a well-tolerated, safe, and effective technique in the management of lymphocele that obviates the need for more invasive surgical procedures.\r"

The treatment group received a single topical application of 50% trichloroacetic acid to the vagina and cervix on day 1. The placebo group was treated in the same manner using saline. The patients were evaluated at 4 and 16 weeks post-treatment for cytologic and histologic evidence of HPV. No differences between the treatment and placebo groups were found. Only one of 16 patients in the treatment group and three of 18 in the placebo group were free of HPV infection at the 4- and 16-week evaluations. Our data suggest that treatment of subclinical HPV infection with trichloroacetic acid is ineffective at this concentration.\r"

However, few studies have examined mucosal changes in patients with objectively documented salivary gland performance. In the present report, the mucosal status of 298 subjects being evaluated in a dry mouth clinic was assessed. A complete oral examination was performed and unstimulated and stimulated salivary samples were collected separately from the parotid and submandibular/sublingual glands. Data were analyzed according to diagnosis and salivary output after the assignment of an oral mucosal rating to each subject. In general, the mucosal surfaces were well preserved and infections were not seen. Patients evaluated for Sjogren's syndrome and radiation-induced xerostomia had the lowest salivary gland performance but displayed a mucosal status similar to denture-wearing healthy subjects or patients with normal salivary flow who had idiopathic xerostomia. However, those patients with a total lack of salivary flow rarely had normal-appearing oral mucosa. These results confirm a role for saliva in oral mucosal preservation and also suggest that other factors may act to maintain oral mucosal integrity.\r"

Ninety-one infants with birth weights between 500 and 1750 g were randomized to receive either IVIG, 500 mg/kg (46 infants), or 5% albumin-normal saline (placebo), 10 ml/kg (45 infants), between Days 3 and 7 of life, 7 days later and every 14 days thereafter for a maximum of 5 doses. Demographic and life event data during pregnancy were similar for IVIG and placebo groups. Birth weight, gestational age, gender, age at entry into the study and incidence of respiratory distress syndrome at birth were also similar in both groups of premature infants. Twenty-six viruses were isolated from 25 infants. There were 13 and 12 infections in the IVIG and placebo groups, respectively. Severity of disease, as measured by clinical factors and outcomes of virus-infected infants were no different in IVIG-treated and placebo groups. Adenoviruses and cytomegalovirus accounted for 57.7 and 23.1%, respectively, of the viral isolates. In this study the use of IVIG did not prevent or modify adenovirus and cytomegalovirus infections in premature infants.\r"

Side effects were rated by parents and teachers at the end of each weekly drug condition. Three children (3.6%) had side effects that were sufficiently serious to warrant immediate discontinuation of medication. Parent ratings indicated that only the side effects of decreased appetite, insomnia, stomachaches, and headaches increased significantly in frequency and severity during the two active medication doses as compared with the placebo condition. Fewer than half of the children experienced these side effects and among those who did, ratings of mean severity remained in the mild range. Teacher ratings showed little change over drug conditions, except on ratings of staring, sadness, and anxiety, which declined with increasing dose of medication. Parent ratings indicated that only the side effects of decreased appetite, insomnia, stomachaches, and headaches increased significantly in frequency and severity during the two active medication doses as compared with the placebo condition. Fewer than half of the children experienced these side effects and among those who did, ratings of mean severity remained in the mild range. Teacher ratings showed little change over drug conditions, except on ratings of staring, sadness, and anxiety, which declined with increasing dose of medication. Surprisingly, a high frequency of these behavior side effects were reported during the placebo condition. Stimulant medication within this therapeutic range, therefore, results in few, generally mild side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90318805\r", 
  ".W": "Promethazine, available by prescription only since its introduction in 1946, has been widely used for pediatric patients because of its antihistaminic, antiemetic, and sedative properties. Recently, it's makers have sought Federal Drug Administration approval to introduce two liquid over the counter allergy/cold/cough products containing promethazine as an active ingredient. Although millions of doses have been administered, promethazine use has not been free of risk. Promethazine has been reported to cause significant sedation, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, dystonic reactions, and possibly apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome. The impact of these relatively uncommon adverse reactions on children would be minimal if parents would use over the counter promethazine only for appropriate indications and only in children greater than 2 years of age. However, according to results of research evaluating the use of various over the counter medications by families for their children, promethazine will be used inappropriately. Both its over the counter status, implying a certain margin of safety, and its formulation as a syrup, providing ease of administration, should increase its use in all age groups including that by children less than 2 years of age who may be most vulnerable to the adverse reactions associated with the drug's use.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover evaluation of the efficacy of standard methylphenidate twice a day and comparable doses every morning of a sustained-release preparation of methylphenidate (SR-20 Ritalin), a sustained-release form of dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine Spansule), and pemoline. The children were participating in a summer treatment program in which they engaged in recreational and classroom activities. Dependent measures include evaluations of social behavior during group recreational activities, classroom performance, and performance on a continuous performance task. Results revealed generally equivalent and beneficial effects of all four medications. Dexedrine Spansule and pemoline tended to produce the most consistent effects and were recommended for 10 of the 15 children who were responders to medication. The continuous performance task results showed that all four medications had an effect within 2 hours of ingestion, and the effects lasted for 9 hours. The implications of these results for the use of long-acting stimulant medication in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Claims that juvenile delinquency may be associated with reactive hypoglycemia or nutritional deficiencies have received widespread attention but little objective evaluation. To assess the validity of these claims, nutritional and psychological indices of juvenile delinquents have been measured. Serum glucose and insulin profiles during an oral sucrose tolerance test were measured in 137 delinquent and 41 nondelinquent male adolescents aged 14 to 19. In addition, nutritional status of both populations was assessed by anthropometry (height, weight, arm circumference, triceps skin fold) and biochemical measures (hematocrit, red-blood cell thiamin, and serum copper, ferritin, and zinc). Delinquent subjects had slightly but significantly lower serum glucose values at four of six time points (fasting, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 180 minutes) and higher serum insulin values at one time point (30 minutes) compared with nondelinquent subjects. Changes in glucose from fasting levels indicate that these subjects were regulating serum glucose adequately, but doing so at lower values; changes in insulin from fasting levels indicate that black delinquents initially secreted more insulin than either white subject group. There were no significant associations between excursions in serum glucose or insulin and any adrenergic signs or symptoms of low blood glucose levels. Nutritional status of incarcerated delinquents did not differ from that of nonincarcerated subjects on most measures. Although the significantly lower serum glucose levels and higher serum insulin levels are intriguing, no support is offered by results of this study for allegations that sucrose ingestion causes reactive hypoglycemia in juvenile delinquents or that delinquent male adolescents are at greater risk nutritionally than male adolescents of the same age who are not delinquent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared the results of the EZ-SCREEN test with results of specimens analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for 36 clinical specimens positive for cannabinoids (marijuana), 38 clinical specimens positive for benzoylecgonine (cocaine), and 33 drug-free specimens. Results from our study for marijuana included: sensitivity = 92%; specificity = 89%; and efficiency = 95, 67, and 87%, respectively. In the present study, there were five false-positive tests for cocaine and one false-positive test for cannabinoids. As with all screening test results, confirmation of positive specimens by a more specific quantitative analytical method such as GC/MS is recommended.\r"

There was a marked seasonal variation in the positive predictive value: 62% in winter and 16% in summer. However, even in peak streptococcal pharyngitis season (January to March), basing therapy on a positive LA test leads to the unnecessary treatment of a large number of patients. Therefore, we cannot recommend the routine performance of this test by all practitioners in all clinical settings.\r"

After selection with the neomycin analogue G418, at least two of the resistant clones were shown to have intact delta antigen by specific immunoblotting, and the delta antigen was located in the cell nucleus by immunofluorescence. Transfected cloned viral DNAs were found to be integrated into cell chromosomes. Replication of the HDV genome was demonstrated by the presence of not only genomic and antigenomic HDV RNAs but also HDV RNAs in multimeric and circular forms. In addition, a 0.8-kilobase antigenomic RNA containing a poly(A) tail and encoding the delta-antigen open reading frame was documented. Continuous replication and transcription of the HDV genome was thus achieved in these transfected cell lines. The results confirmed that replication of HDV was unassisted by HBV. Stable passage of such cell lines strongly suggests that HDV lacks direct cytopathicity in hepatocytes. These clones should be useful in studying the details of the HDV life cycle and the relationship between HDV and its helper virus, HBV.\r"

Glutamate binding was found to be increased by approximately 50% in the PSDs isolated from kindled rats as compared to controls; this increase was almost completely from an increase in Bmax; Kd decreased only slightly. Studies with inhibitors indicate that the receptors involved were of the N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate types. PSDs isolated from control and kindled rats did not differ in gamma-aminobutyric acid or flunitrazepam binding. The in vitro autophosphorylation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was depressed by 45-76% in PSDs isolated from kindled rats as compared to controls, with little change in amount of the kinase. Therefore, we infer that (i) the kindled state is associated with an increase in glutamate activation of postsynaptic sites, allowing Ca2+ to enter dendritic spines, (ii) a change has occurred in activity of the protein kinase, which is the major cerebral cortex PSD protein, and (iii) perhaps major alterations in the PSD are a concomitant to the long-lasting nature of the kindled state.\r"

  ".U": "90319107\r", 
  ".W": "During site-specific recombination by the gamma delta resolvase, four DNA strands are broken, exchanged, and religated. This exchange is carried out within a DNA-protein complex, the synaptosome, in which the recombination sites, res, are aligned. The domain of resolvase that binds to a res site is distinct from the domain that breaks and rejoins the DNA. We tested whether the catalytic domain acts on the res site to which its binding domain is bound (in cis) or on the opposing res site in the synaptic complex (in trans). We constructed a hybrid synaptosome in which one res site is bound to wild-type resolvase and the other is bound to a mutant resolvase that binds normally but is unable to break DNA. From the pattern of strand breakage in the reaction intermediate containing resolvase covalently attached to DNA, we conclude that resolvase attacks predominantly, if not exclusively, in cis. Because cis breakage and reunion per se cannot lead to recombination, our results support a model in which DNA exchange is guided by an exchange of resolvase subunits between the breakage and reunion events.\r"

During interphase at growing phase, CaM kinase II was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the enzyme was localized within the whole nuclear matrix in which the enzyme was specially concentrated in nucleoli. During mitosis, CaM kinase II was found to be a dynamic component of the mitotic apparatus, particularly present at microtubule-organizing centers. In metaphase and anaphase, CaM kinase II was observed at centrosomes and between the spindle poles. During telophase, CaM kinase II was condensed as a bright fluorescent dot at the midzone of the intercellular bridge between two daughter cells, while tubulin was found at each side of the midbody. Colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor, disorganized the tubulin- and CaM kinase II specific fluorescent structure of mitotic 3Y1 cells. In cold-treated cells, CaM kinase II was localized predominantly at centrosomes. The localization of CaM kinase II in the cell nucleus and the mitotic apparatus suggests that the enzyme may play a role in the cell cycle progression of mammalian cells.\r"

The purified RecQ protein exhibited a DNA-dependent ATPase and a helicase activity. Without DNA, no ATPase activity was detected. The capacity as ATPase cofactor varied with the type of DNA in the following order: circular single strand greater than linear single strand much greater than circular or linear duplex. As a helicase, RecQ protein displaced an annealed 71-base or 143-base single-stranded fragment from circular or linear phage M13 DNA, and the direction of unwinding seemed to be 3'----5' with respect to the DNA single strand to which the enzyme supposedly bound. Furthermore, the protein could unwind 143-base-pair blunt-ended duplex DNA at a higher enzyme concentration. It is concluded that RecQ protein is a previously unreported helicase, which might possibly serve to generate single-stranded tails for a strand transfer reaction in the process of recombination.\r"

  ".U": "90319115\r", 
  ".W": "GAL11 was first identified as a gene required for full expression of some of the galactose-inducible genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A null mutation within the GAL11 locus causes defects in mating, growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, and sporulation of gal11 homozygotes. The mating defect was observed only in MAT alpha gal11 strains. Northern hybridization analysis revealed that a gal11 mutation impaired transcription of alpha-specific genes (MF alpha 1 and STE3) but not of an a-specific gene (STE2). Furthermore, this mutation reduced expression of the MAT alpha locus, suggesting that a deficiency in MAT alpha 1 protein is responsible for the reduced expression of alpha-specific genes. Since general regulatory factor I (GRFI)/repressor/activator site binding protein 1 (RAP1)/translation upstream factor (TUF) is believed to be an activator of MAT alpha expression, we examined whether PYK1, which is known to be regulated by GRFI/RAP1/TUF, is also affected by the gal11 mutation. It was determined that the level of PYK1 message was significantly lowered by the mutation. The requirement for functional GAL11 in transcriptional activation was bypassed when either the upstream activating sequence of galactose-inducible genes or of PYK1 was placed very close to the TATA box, suggesting that one of the Gal11 protein functions is to mediate the activation signal of Gal4 and GRFI/RAP1/TUF, when the respective binding site is situated at the naturally occurring distance from the TATA box.\r"

It is composed of two components, A and B, that are both needed for DNA binding. We have isolated a rat cDNA containing the complete 341-amino acid coding sequence of the B component of CBF. Expression of this cDNA in vitro generates a polypeptide that shows the same dependency on the A component as the native B component in the formation of a complex with a CCAAT-containing DNA. The C-terminal portion of the B component from residue 260 to residue 312 shows a 75% sequence identity with a portion of the Hap2 protein, a component of a heteromeric CCAAT-binding protein in yeast. In contrast, the rest of the protein shows little sequence homology with Hap2, although both proteins contain glutamine-rich domains. In the B component of CBF this domain spans the amino-terminal 60% of the protein, whereas in Hap2 this domain is much smaller. Hence, only a few changes in one domain of this protein were tolerated during evolution between yeast and mammals, whereas the rest of the protein diverged much more extensively.\r"

  ".W": "Detailed molecular definition of the WAGR region at chromosome 11p13 has been achieved by chromosome breakpoint analysis and long-range restriction mapping. Here we describe the molecular detection of a cytogenetically invisible 1-megabase deletion in an individual with aniridia, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias but no Wilms tumor (WT). The region of overlap between this deletion and one associated with WT and similar genital anomalies but no aniridia covers a region of 350-400 kilobases, which is coincident with the extent of homozygous deletion detected in tumor tissue from a sporadic WT. A candidate WT gene located within this region has recently been isolated, suggesting nonpenetrance for tumor expression in the first individual. The inclusion within the overlap region of a gene for WT predisposition and a gene for the best-documented WT-associated genitourinary malformations leads us to suggest that both of these anomalies result from a loss-of-function mutation at the same locus. This in turn implies that the WT gene exerts pleiotropic effect on both kidney and genitourinary development, a possibility supported by the observed expression pattern of the WT candidate gene in developing kidney and gonads.\r"

  ".W": "The mitotic cell cycle of yeast and animal cells is regulated by the cdc2 gene and its product, the p34 protein kinase, and by other components of the MPF or histone H1 kinase complex. We present evidence that cdc2, p34, and a histone H1 kinase also exist in higher plants. Protein extracts from 10 plant species surveyed display a 34-kDa component recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against an evolutionarily conserved epitope of fission yeast p34. Nondenatured protein extracts of mitotic Pisum sativum (garden pea) tissues were fractionated by gel filtration, electrophoretically separated under denaturing conditions, and immunoblotted. p34 crossreactive material was apparent in both low and high molecular mass fractions, indicating that pea p34 occurs as both a monomer and as part of a high molecular mass complex. Histone H1 kinase activity was found predominantly in the higher molecular mass fractions, those to which the least phosphorylated form of pea p34 was confined. We also report the cloning of the pea homologue of cdc2 by polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequence analysis reveals perfect conservation of the hallmark \"PSTAIR\" sequence motif found in all cdc2 gene products analyzed to date.\r"

Artificially induced development completely inhibits growth and represses expression of the endogenous alcA gene and the coordinately controlled aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (aldA). Repression of alcA and aldA expression probably occurs at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. We propose that developmental induction results in a generalized metabolic shutdown, leading to an inability of cells to acquire nutrients from the growth medium. Self-imposed nutrient limitation could reinforce the primary developmental stimulus and ensure progression through the asexual reproductive pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Using a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin 3 (IL-3) receptor (anti-Aic2), we isolated a cDNA (AIC2B) from a mouse mast cell line which is homologous to the previously characterized gene for the IL-3 receptor (AIC2A). This cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 896 amino acid residues and has 91% amino acid sequence identity with the IL-3 receptor. A consensus sequence defining an additional cytokine receptor family is present in this clone. Compared to the AIC2A clone, the AIC2B cDNA encodes a protein with amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions dispersed throughout the entire protein. Oligonucleotide probes specific for each cDNA hybridized with different genomic fragments, indicating that the AIC2A and AIC2B proteins are encoded by two distinct genes. Fibroblasts transfected with the AIC2B cDNA expressed the protein at the cell surface as determined by binding with the anti-Aic2 antibody but did not bind IL-3 or other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and IL-9 (p40) at concentrations between 1 and 10 nM. An S1 nuclease protection assay was used to discriminate between the AIC2A and AIC2B transcripts. We found that the AIC2B gene was coexpressed with the AIC2A gene. These results suggest a potential involvement of AIC2B in cytokine signal transduction.\r"

  ".U": "90319137\r", 
  ".W": "Radial glial cells and their processes play critical roles in organizing the spatial arrangement of the nervous system in the embryonic brain. It has been thought that following completion of their roles in the embryo, most of the radial glial processes disappear before or shortly after birth. Here we use R2D5, a monoclonal antibody to a soluble cytosolic protein, to demonstrate that a specific system of midsagittal radial glial cells persists in postnatal and adult brain. In the brainstem of postnatally developing and adult rabbits and cats, the R2D5-positive processes of radial glial cells were observed to be arranged in a precisely parallel array at the midsagittal seam. These radial glial processes formed a continuous palisade separating the right and left brainstem. In early postnatal animals, R2D5-positive radial processes were found to reach the pial surface and to cover the entire midsagittal seam of the brainstem. These processes embraced dendrites and somata of neurons in almost all of the midsagittal nuclei, including the raphe nuclei, suggesting that the radial glial cells may interact with the midsagittal groups of neurons. In addition, the palisade of R2D5-positive radial processes formed loose openings for crossing axonal bundles at the midline decussations of fiber tracts. In more mature brains, somata of R2D5-positive radial glial cells that had migrated ventrally were observed within the palisades, and in adult cats, most of the R2D5-positive radial processes were found to have retracted from the ventral parts of the midsagittal seam. The spatial arrangement of R2D5-positive processes suggests that they may have persistent functional roles as an interface between ventricular humoral signals and midsagittal groups of neurons in the postnatally developing brainstem and in the adult brainstem. The structure of the midline glial system suggests also that it plays a role in organizing the spatial arrangement of decussating axons during development.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution two-dimensional PAGE was used to search for glucose-response proteins in isolated pancreatic islets that were labeled with [35S]methionine at ambient glucose concentrations of 0-18 mM. A 65-kDa protein, isoelectric focusing point of approximately 6.6-7.0, was discovered that showed at least a 20-fold stimulation of radiolabeling when glucose in the labeling medium was increased from 3 to 18 mM, in contrast to a 2.5-fold enhancement of label incorporation into total islet proteins. This 65-kDa protein is evident after 30 min of labeling with 18 mM glucose and is preferentially synthesized compared to its nearest neighbors after both 30 and 60 min of labeling. Glucose induction of the 65-kDa protein was virtually blocked by D-mannoheptulose. Glucose induction of this 65-kDa protein is in practically all aspects comparable to glucose induction of insulin and glucokinase in pancreatic beta cells. A working hypothesis is developed proposing that glucose-response proteins or \"glucospondins\" are pivotal constituents of pancreatic islet cells and that their discovery and exploration promise new insights into normal and pathological islet cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The NtrC protein activates transcription of the glnA operon of enteric bacteria by stimulating the formation of stable \"open\" complexes by RNA polymerase (sigma 54-holoenzyme form). To regulate the glnA promoter, NtrC binds to sites that have the properties of transcriptional enhancers: the sites will function far from the promoter and in an orientation-independent fashion. To investigate the mechanism of enhancer function, we have used electron microscopy to visualize the interactions of purified NtrC and RNA polymerase with their DNA binding sites and with each other. Under conditions that allow the formation of open complexes, about 30% of DNA molecules carry both RNA polymerase and NtrC bound to their specific sites. Of these, about 15% form looped structures in which NtrC and the RNA polymerase-promoter complex are in contact. The length of the looped DNA is that predicted from the spacing that was engineered between the enhancer and the glnA promoter (390 base pairs). As expected for activation intermediates, the looped structures disappear when RNA polymerase is allowed to transcribe the DNA. We conclude that the NtrC enhancer functions by means of a direct association between DNA-bound NtrC and RNA polymerase (DNA-looping model). Association of DNA-bound proteins appears to be the major mechanism by which different types of site-specific DNA transactions are localized and controlled.\r"

  ".W": "rRNA synthesis in Escherichia coli is subject to at least two regulation systems, growth rate-dependent control and stringent control. The inverse correlation between rRNA synthesis rates and guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate (ppGpp) levels under various physiological conditions has led to the supposition that ppGpp is the mediator of both control mechanisms by inhibiting transcription from rrn P1 promoters. Recently, relA- spoT- strains have been constructed in which both ppGpp synthesis pathways most likely have been removed (M. Cashel, personal communication). We have confirmed that such strains produce no detectable ppGpp and therefore offer a direct means for testing the involvement of ppGpp in the regulation of rRNA synthesis in vivo. Stringent control was determined by measurement of rRNA synthesis after amino acid starvation, while growth rate control was determined by measurement of rRNA synthesis under different nutritional conditions. As expected, the relA- spoT- strain is relaxed for stringent control. However, growth rate-dependent regulation is unimpaired. These results indicate that growth rate regulation can occur in the absence of ppGpp and imply that ppGpp is not the mediator, or at least is not the sole mediator, of growth rate-dependent control. Therefore, growth rate-dependent control and stringent control may utilize different mechanisms for regulating stable RNA synthesis.\r"

Acoustic-immitance measurements obtain sophisticated data that give us valuable information about the middle ear mechanism as a whole. It can be used in a quiet office environment. Immitance audiometry can confirm a doubtful otoscopic diagnosis and screen for ear disease. There are limitations to observer reliability with otoscopy, which has good sensitivity but poor specificity, in contrast to immitance audiometry. The tympanogram can be classified into four different patterns on the basis of its characteristics. These patterns are diagnostic, distinguishing normal function from various types of middle ear pathology. Immitance audiometry has very high sensitivity and specificity. The acoustic reflex, a contraction of the stapedius muscle following an intense auditory stimulus, can be valuable in determining a conductive hearing loss and many other otologic diagnoses. As a screening tool, immitance audiometry is most valuable in populations at risk for middle ear effusion, primarily those aged 7 months to 5 years. Significant improvements in measurements of ear function also allow us to be more precise in the diagnoses of otosclerosis, perforation of the tympanic membrane, ossicular discontinuity, facial nerve dysfunction, and brain stem disorders.\r"

The initial prescription and fitting of hearing aids is the realm of the audiologist. The primary care physician can enhance the treatment program by providing global evaluation, educating the patient as to likely therapy and realistic expectations of results, and providing long-term follow-up and functional assessment of hearing aid use. The burden of hearing loss is particularly heavy in the nursing home population. In this arena, the physician can ease the burden by being attentive to the possibility of hearing loss causing unexpected behavior, searching for, and when possible, treating reversible causes, and using assistive devices and behavioral techniques to enhance communication when the hearing impairment cannot be corrected.\r"

The patient without positive identification of streptococci will need either observation or further evaluation depending on the degree of illness. Classic croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is a clinical entity that can be diagnosed with reasonable confidence. The few patients that require hospitalization can be treated with humidity, racemic epinephrine, corticosteroids, parental and child support, or any combination of these with good results. Continued observation of all patients with croup is necessary to recognize the uncommon complication of bacterial tracheitis when it occurs. Epiglottitis has a varied clinical appearance and management according to age groups. Infants show a mixed clinical picture similar to croup, but with more obstruction. The classic epiglottitis with acute airway obstruction is seen in the 3-8-year-old age group. Adults have a less fulminant form of supraglottitis. Infants and children will need artificial airway management in most cases, whereas many adults can be treated simply with observation.\r"

Laboratory and radiographic studies are of minimum value in making this distinction, and biopsy, under general anesthesia, by a competent head and neck surgeon with microscopic evaluation is often necessary. Office biopsy or large or fine-needle aspiration should not be attempted. Fortunately, most neoplasms are benign, and many malignant forms are low grade and have a good prognosis.\r"

Forty (50%) had their diagnoses established by sputum smears and cultures alone, 20 (25%) by brush/wash specimens from fiberoptic bronchoscopy alone, 18 (22.5%) from both sources, and two (2.5%) by gastric smears. The average age of the patients was 71.3 years, and only 20% had symptoms typical of pulmonary tuberculosis. Our data reveal that findings in smears from fiberoptic bronchoscopy were of comparable sensitivity (80%) to those of sputum (72.5%); in 25/80 (31.25%), diagnosis was made exclusively by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Such a high sensitivity of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis indicates a threefold rise (P = .018) in the number of diagnoses made in this manner compared to our figures from 1983 (10% of diagnoses made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy). Forty-three of the 80 patients (53.8%) had either a negative sputum smear or no sputum available. Thirty of the 43 patients (69.8%) had diagnostic bronchoscopy, which provided an immediate diagnosis (smear positivity) in 18 patients (60%). Transbronchial biopsy was most useful in excluding associated malignancy. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is playing an increasingly significant role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. Further studies are essential to evaluate cost effectiveness, specificity of fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and the influence of the procedure on morbidity and mortality in pulmonary tuberculosis.\r"

Abdominal pain (66%), vomiting (31%), and obstipation (10%) were the most common symptoms. Abdominal findings included distention (69%), tenderness (41%), and a mass (10%). The classic roentgenographic omega sign of volvulus was present on plain films in only 29% of the cases. Barium enema examination was diagnostic in 61% of the cases in which it was used. Nonoperative treatment by barium enema or proctoscopy was successful in all 17 cases in which it was attempted. The recurrence rate after nonoperative treatment was 31%. Thirty children had operation. The mortality in the group of patients having \"derotation\" alone was 29%. Immediate resection was associated with a 25% mortality; none of the patients who had elective resection died. Sigmoid resection is the definitive treatment for children as well as adults, but nonoperative decompression to allow for elective resection should be attempted in patients who have no evidence of peritonitis.\r"

Regardless of the predictive validity of fire models, conclusions about the ability of shelters to protect their occupants against firestorms, if they occur, are based primarily on historical experience. A review of the original data from the Hamburg firestorm shows that almost all persons in adequate shelters survived, contradicting a currently prevailing belief that all died. The results of the strategic bombing during World War II and of nuclear weapons tests show that a considerable level of population protection can be achieved through attention to proper shelter design.\r"

  ".U": "90319914\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanisms of differentiation of the mammary gland apparently can explain the contradictory findings on the association of breast cancer with excess body weight. Excess weight may be related to the initiation of breast cancer in premenopausal women through its effect on menstrual cycles and on progesterone secretion and to the promotion of breast cancer in postmenopausal women through its effect on estrogen metabolism. Although body weight is unlikely to be as strong a risk factor for breast cancer as it is for endometrial cancer, it may have a greater importance from a public health point of view, because the ratio of the incidence of breast cancer to that of endometrial cancer is 4.5 in whites and 6 in blacks. Thus, more studies seem warranted. It is not possible, however, to rule out the view that the reported correlation between excess weight and breast cancer is attributable to failure to adjust for potential confounders, such as dietary fat. New insights may come from the combined assessment of weight, different types of dietary fat, and reproductive history factors known to be involved in the natural history of breast cancer. For example, in the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS), the survival rate of breast cancer patients on a 20 per cent fat diet is being compared with that of breast cancer patients of similar weight keeping their usual 35 to 40 per cent fat diet. This investigation will show whether dietary fat influences the rate of progression (metastasis) and of promotion (occurrence of cancer in the other breast) independent of body weight.\r"

  ".W": "Breast radiography should be performed only with film-screen mammography or xeromammography. At least two views of each breast should be obtained, and for film-screen mammography, at least one of these should be the oblique view. Quality assurance is becoming a significant concern in breast cancer screening. The ACR Mammography Accreditation Program takes into account the qualifications of the personnel, the performance of the x-ray equipment, and a peer review of the final product: the diagnostic image. The mammographic signs of malignancy can be divided into primary, secondary, and indirect. The accuracy of mammography depends on several factors, but the greatest limitation is the density of the breast tissue. Very dense tissue makes detection of breast cancer difficult, and a negative mammogram should never deter one from a biopsy of a clinically suspect mass. New consensus guidelines for breast cancer screening were developed to bring uniformity to the recommendations of the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and various professional medical societies. These new guidelines reflect the encouraging results from recent clinical trials, as well as some discouraging reports on breast self-examination and the baseline mammogram. The underutilization of screening mammography is a problem of significant concern to both private and public health agencies. Barriers to mammographic screening include lack of awareness of the benefits of screening, physicians' misconceptions about patient compliance, concerns about radiation risk and overdiagnosis, fear of mastectomy, a perception that a mammogram involves great discomfort, and relatively high cost. Nationwide educational programs are under way to counter misconceptions about mammography, and various strategies are evolving to overcome the other barriers. Sonography is a useful adjunct to mammography for cyst-solid differentiation, but mammography is the only imaging modality effective for the early detection of breast cancer.\r"

This post hoc analysis of the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) evaluates the effects of daily administration of propranolol 180 or 240 mg/day after non-Q-wave AMI. The study population consisted of 601 patients with enzymatically proven non-Q-wave AMI, which represented 17% of the BHAT patients. Of these, 310 patients were randomized to receive propranolol and 291 patients to placebo. There were no significant baseline differences between groups. The median follow-up was 24.6 months. Mortality was 7.8% (sudden death 4.8%) in the propranolol group and 7.9% (sudden death 4.8%) in the placebo group (p greater than 0.99, log rank test). Reinfarction rate was 7.4% in the propranolol group and 6.5% in the placebo group (p greater than 0.63, log rank test). The need for coronary bypass surgery was similar in the 2 groups. However, more patients randomized to placebo developed angina. In this post hoc group analysis of the BHAT, propranolol was not shown to be beneficial in reducing the cardiac event rate in patients recovering from a non-Q-wave AMI.\r"

Electrocardiograms and myocardial lactate, hypoxanthine and urate production were determined in 26 patients with a stenosis in the left anterior descending artery without angiographically demonstrable collaterals. Measurements took place before angioplasty, after each of 4 occlusions and 15 minutes after the last balloon inflation. Patients were randomly given placebo or DL-diltiazem (0.4 mg/kg as a bolus intravenously, followed by an infusion of 15 mg/hr). During angioplasty the ST-segment elevation for the anterior wall leads V2, V4 and V6, and the intracoronary lead was similar for both groups, as was lactate release. Diltiazem significantly reduced cardiac hypoxanthine release immediately after angioplasty from 63 to 88% (p less than 0.05). The drug diminished urate production after the last dilatation by 82% (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, intravenous infusion of diltiazem reduced cardiac adenosine triphosphate breakdown during angioplasty as shown by diminished hypoxanthine and urate production. In contrast, diltiazem was unable to attenuate ST-segment elevation and lactate release.\r"

  ".W": "The utility of stress-redistribution thallium-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with a prior single myocardial infarction was studied in 66 patients who were tested by both SPECT and coronary angiography. SPECT was quantified by comparing the patients' circumferential count profiles to a previously established normal data base and by plotting the results onto a polar coordinate map that localized defects to the 3 major coronary artery territories. The pattern of reversibility of the quantitatively detected defects was assessed by consensus visual analysis. SPECT thallium-201 detected myocardial infarction in 62 of 66 patients (sensitivity = 94%). Sixty-five percent of the infarct zones showed some reversibility at 4-hour imaging which corresponded with angiographic evidence of flow to the infarct zones in 95.5% of cases. Late (18 to 24 hours) imaging, done in 26 patients, showed complete or partial reversibility of 29% of infarct zone segments which were nonreversible on 4-hour images. To improve specificity for detection of disease in coronary arteries supplying the non-infarct territories, new quantitative criteria were developed that took into consideration contiguity of defects with the infarct zone. Accuracy for detection of patients with multivessel coronary disease by quantitative thallium-201 SPECT was 86%, which was significantly higher than those of the clinical response to exercise (48%), the exercise electrocardiographic response (56%) or their combination (65%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twelve patients with documented coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris and normal left ventricular function were studied by an incremental atrial pacing stress test before and after intravenous captopril (n = 8) or placebo (n = 4). There were no significant differences in the extent of coronary disease or left ventricular function between the 2 groups and resting plasma-renin levels were normal. Captopril increased the time to angina (14 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 5 minutes, p less than 0.05), increased heart rate at development of angina (126 +/- 7 to 142 +/- 7 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and tended to increase coronary blood flow (229 +/- 154 to 296 +/- 259 ml/min, p = 0.11) and decrease coronary vascular resistance (53 +/- 10 to 47 +/- 3 dynes s cm-5/1,000, p = 0.11) at peak stress without alteration in systemic hemodynamics. No significant changes were seen after placebo administration. Therefore, intravenous captopril appears to cause a short-term increase of coronary vascular reserve, and anginal threshold in patients with chronic stable angina. This effect appears to be independent of inhibition of the systemic renin-angiotensin system or systemic hemodynamic changes.\r"

This study examined the hypothesis that type A behavior would affect the amount of effort expended, as indicated by the exercise time and the maximum heart rate achieved, thereby resulting in differences in exercise test outcome. A total of 1,260 patients with suspected CAD, all of whom had coronary angiography, a structured interview to assess type A behavior and a treadmill exercise test, participated. Of these patients, 818 (65%) had significant CAD, and 852 (68%) were type A. There were no differences between type A and B patients in either maximum heart rate or total exercise time. Among both type A and B subjects, 36% of treadmill tests were positive. Exercise test sensitivity was similar for both groups (69% for type A vs 72% for type B, p = 0.39). Similarly, specificity was similar for both groups (87% for type A vs 80% for type B, p = 0.09). Results did not change after using logistic regression to control for potential confounding factors. Thus, type A behavior does not need to be taken into account when interpreting exercise test outcome.\r"

Detection of the neu oncogene products in breast carcinoma was selected as a model for analysis of oncogene expression. Fifty-two primary human breast carcinomas were evaluated by quantitation of neu DNA amplification and mRNA expression and by localization of neu mRNA and protein (p 185) at the cellular level by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The specificity and sensitivity of the molecular and immunologic probes for neu were established with the use of genetically engineered cell lines that overexpressed either neu or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Twenty-nine percent of breast carcinomas demonstrated neu DNA amplification and mRNA overexpression, and there was close correlation between the level of neu mRNA expression and detection of neu gene products by ISH and IHC. Thirty-two percent of carcinomas demonstrated neu mRNA overexpression by ISH. The immunohistochemical method using TA1 monoclonal antibody for p185 was exquisitely sensitive in acetone-fixed frozen sections and provided an excellent approach for judging overexpression as confirmed by the various molecular analyses. All areas of nonmalignant breast epithelium stained weakly, and a wide range of staining intensity was observed in malignant breast epithelium, with 31% of carcinomas judged to be p185 overexpressors. Heterogeneous expression of p185 was seen in some carcinomas. This study provides a strategic approach for the evaluation of oncogene expression in human tumors.\r"

  ".U": "90320631\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in solving problems of tumor histogenesis in surgical pathology, monoclonal antibodies to four distinct epitopes of CEA (E-Z-EM) were applied to paraffin sections of 303 epithelial neoplasms from multiple sites. Two epitopes were CEA specific (D14 and B7.1), one was shared with nonspecific cross-reacting antigen (NCA) (B7.8), and the fourth (B18) was common to CEA, NCA, and biliary glycoprotein antigen (BGP). A sample of the tumors (n = 110) was also stained with a polyclonal anti-CEA (DAKO). Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, including esophageal and gastric (n = 19), small intestinal (n = 8), colorectal (n = 56), biliary tract (n = 8), and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n = 14), were consistently positive with all five antibodies. Other predominantly gland-forming carcinomas tested, comprising lung (n = 22), ovary (n = 18), and endometrium (n = 12), were either invariably negative with all five antibodies (endometrial adenocarcinoma, non-mucinous ovarian adenocarcinoma) or demonstrated selective and variable positivity (lung: D14, 50%; ovarian mucinous: D14, 50%). Among large polygonal cell carcinomas (hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and adrenal carcinoma), only hepatomas stained positively, showing a distinctive canalicular staining pattern with the B18 (BGP epitope) (55%) and polyclonal antibody (50%). In the small polygonal cell carcinoma category, true CEA positivity was rare in breast (D14, 10% and B7.1, 14%) and never seen in prostatic carcinomas and carcinoid tumors. A subset of these breast (8 of 42), prostate (4 of 22), and carcinoids (4 of 7) showed exclusive positivity for the B18 antibody (NCA/BGP epitope). Ovarian serous papillary carcinomas (n = 14), papillary carcinomas of thyroid (n = 12), transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder (n = 11), and mesotheliomas (n = 3) were negative with all monoclonal antibodies. Metastatic carcinomas (n = 74) showed a similar pattern of reactivity to primary tumors. The authors conclude that CEA immunostaining may assist in identifying the histogenesis of epithelial tumors in several morphologic categories; that differential reactivities of the CEA monoclonal antibody panel exceed those of the polyclonal antibody; and that the discriminating power of the monoclonal panel is related to whether (1) CEA is or is not produced or (2) NCA or BGP is produced without concomitant CEA production. There is little evidence to support a concept of site-specific CEA species.\r"

Fifteen aspirates interpreted as reactive hyperplasia were also examined. All aspirates were studied by immunoperoxidase on cytospin preparations with the use of antibodies DRC1, kappa, lambda, CD3, CD5, and CD20. The follicular lymphomas could not be identified reliably by morphologic examination of aspirate smears. Clusters of DRC1-positive (DRC1+) cells were present in seven of seven follicular lymphomas, one of one mantle zone lymphoma, and one of seven small lymphocytic lymphomas. Rare DRC1+ cells were present in one of one diffuse mixed and one of seven large cell lymphomas. One lymphoblastic, one Burkitt's, and two diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas had no DRC1+ cells. None of the seven follicular lymphomas was CD5 positive (CD5+), whereas five of the seven small lymphocytic lymphomas were CD5+. Conversely, all seven follicular lymphomas were CD20-positive (CD20+), but only one of seven small lymphocytic lymphomas was CD20+. Nineteen of the lymphomas, including all 7 of the follicular lymphomas, were either kappa or lambda positive. The other eight lymphomas were T-cell (1), B-cell (1), true histiocytic (1), or \"null\" cell (5). The reactive aspirates had both kappa- and lambda-positive B-cells. Seven of the 15 had clusters of DRC1+ cells. To further evaluate these antibodies, the authors studied 29 additional, surgically biopsied, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas that had not been aspirated. Similar results were obtained, except that three of five diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas had DRC1+ cells. DRC1, in conjunction with antibodies to CD5, CD20, kappa, and lambda, helps to distinguish follicular lymphoma from small lymphocytic lymphoma. DRC1 is not useful in separating reactive hyperplasia from follicular lymphoma.\r"

In four cases, the patients presented with signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis during their 26th to 31st week of pregnancy; in the other two, the lesions were discovered incidentally in appendectomy specimens obtained during cesarean section and tubal ligation at term. Histologically, the lesions were characterized by the presence of multiple, irregularly distributed submesothelial deposits of decidualized cells in the serosa of the appendix, without any associated evidence of endometriosis. By immunohistochemistry, the decidualized cells strongly labelled with vimentin antibodies, consistent with their stromal origin. In two cases, coexpression of vimentin and desmin intermediate filaments was observed, suggestive of myoid differentiation. The possible relationship of the lesions with the development of symptoms of peritoneal irritation in these patients is discussed along with a review of the literature on the abdominal complications of ectopic decidua.\r"

The sclerosant was 5% sodium morrhuate in case 1 (total dose, 10 ml) and 5% ethanolamine oleate in case 2 (45.5 ml). Although no recurrent variceal bleeding occurred after sclerotherapy, we could not perform any curative surgical treatment for esophageal cancer because of the advanced stage of the cancer and the severity of the accompanying liver dysfunction. It is difficult to determine the relationship between sclerotherapy and carcinoma; however, long-term surveillance is essential to avoid overlooking a neoplasm in the esophagus after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy.\r"

Had pneumococcal vaccination been the success that might reasonably have been predicted, there would be no argument, this many years later, over its merits. Although polysaccharide vaccines appear to have been effective in mass vaccination programs and in epidemic situations where presumably healthy adults have been involved, it has been more difficult to document their efficacy in individuals who are most in need of them, namely those with aberrant or senescent immune systems. There seems to be no disagreement that antibody at some concentration (the precise level remains to be determined) will, in general, be associated with protection, although in any one individual, for a variety of reasons, infection with a vaccine serotype might still occur. Thus, the clear direction for the future should be not to argue further the merits of currently available vaccine preparations, but rather to work rapidly and efficiently to develop and test new and more effective polysaccharide antigens. Studies in the past 10 years have shown that the polyribosyl ribitolphosphate (PRP) of Haemophilus influenzae type b is a far more effective antigen when conjugated to diphtheria toxoid. For example, in a study in our laboratory, vaccination of healthy young adults with PRP-conjugated diphtheria toxoid yielded serum antibody levels 10- to 100-fold higher than after PRP alone. Responses may be even better if other proteins are used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is now clear that there is a set of genes, known as oncogenes, that can cause cells to become malignant if their expression is altered, either by mutation or overexpression. The products of these genes include growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal tranduction proteins, and DNA binding proteins. The normal cellular counterparts of these genes play very important roles in the regulation of growth and proliferation by normal cells. Another set of genes, anti-oncogenes, also play an important role in preventing abnormal cell proliferation. The remarkable explosion of understanding of the pathophysiology of malignancy has led to a common unifying concept of malignant transformation that applies to all tumors. It is likely that these new insights will lead to improved and more specific treatments for malignant disease in the next decade.\r"

The authors report that growth factor-induced cytotoxicity in these cells is mediated by proteolytic enzymes. Treatment of A172 cells with either EGF or PDGF resulted in marked increase of their cytotoxicity (Release Index = 150%). Similarly, RBC induced release index by hEGFr-3T3 cells was elevated to 420% in the presence of 3.4 pM of EGF. However, in A172 cells, PDGF did not have a significant effect on DNA and protein synthesis indicating that stimulation of proteolytic activity is independent of the growth factor signaling pathway. Growth factor induced cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by protease inhibitors in both cell lines. Using EDTA and leupeptin several proteolytic species were identified and localized to cellular membranes as evidenced by polyacrylamide-gelatin electrophoresis assay. These data suggest that growth factors regulate the activation or secretion of proteolytic enzymes in cancer cells and may mediate the invasive and metastatic behavior of these cells.\r"

Early results from a new case-control study suggest the possibility that the risk of myocardial infarction associated with oral contraceptive use is now lower than in the past, although the previously observed small increase in the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage appears to be unchanged.\r"

Very low-density lipoproteins transport triglycerides to peripheral tissues, whereas low-density lipoproteins are the main carriers of cholesterol. Cholesterol transport in low-density lipoprotein enters body cells by way of \"low-density lipoprotein receptor pathway\" but may also be taken up by macrophages by way of the \"scavenger pathway.\" Excessive influx of cholesterol by way of the \"scavenger pathway\" may result in deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls and atheroma formation. In a yet incompletely known process of \"reverse cholesterol transport,\" cholesterol is carried away from the tissues to the liver by high-density lipoproteins. The above-mentioned transport processes are regulated by a well-synchronized system that involves several enzymes and lipid transport proteins. Under normal conditions, the lipoprotein system is able to balance the flow of cholesterol and other lipids in both directions between the liver and peripheral tissues. This delicate balance may be disturbed by many factors, including contraceptive steroids. The metabolic steps influenced by administration of contraceptive steroids are summarized.\r"

All known congenital and acquired abnormalities in the biochemistry of hemostasis are related to thrombotic and cardiovascular diseases in the way that would be expected on the basis of theories about the role of balances between coagulation and fibrinolysis and between activating and inhibiting factors. Notwithstanding the consistency between theory and observed abnormalities, a causal relationship between biochemical abnormality and clinical symptoms has been proved only in a limited number of situations, and it is possible that certain abnormalities only (or also) mark pathologic events. The limitations of laboratory diagnosis of hemostatic disorders in relation to hemostasis as a local process are discussed. It is proposed that more attention be paid to methods of evaluating the local aspects, for example, methods that assess reaction products in the circulation and that can provide an averaged message of the local phenomena. In addition, such methods can provide information about the dynamic balances in the hemostatic system, whereas historically more attention has been paid to the static balances in the potential of hemostatic processes.\r"

Various abnormalities of the hemostatic system (platelet hyperaggregability, hypercoagulability, and hypofibrinolysis) have been described in all these situations. The individual effect of each of these disease on the hemostatic system is difficult to evaluate because these states are often associated in the same patient and the treatment of one can benefit the others. Therefore it may be queried if a common abnormality of these pathologic states might explain their impact on the cardiovascular system. We have been interested by hyperinsulinemia, which is observed in obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, type II diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia, and we have shown a very strong correlation between plasma insulin, body mass index, triglyceride levels, and one of the main inhibitors of the fibrinolytic system, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Partial correlation analysis showed that only the correlation between insulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 was independent. Therefore a high plasma insulin level could be responsible for elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which by inducing an hypofibrinolysis, could play a role in the deposition of fibrin and the development of atherothrombosis. The description of some interrelations between metabolic diseases and hemostasis is satisfactory but does not exclude specific effects of these diseases on hemostasis, such as glycation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in diabetes or toxic action of lipoprotein on endothelial cells in hyperlipoproteinemia.\r"

This variability is seen in differences between different populations, as well as from one individual to another. These studies also show variability in area under the curve and other parameters in the same person from time to time. Such differences may equal or exceed the differences between low dose (35 micrograms) and high-dose (50 micrograms) formulations. The levels of plasma ethinyl estradiol produced by a 50 micrograms dose of mestranol are similar to those from 35 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol. Thus a high-dose pill may be no higher than a low-dose pill if the nature of the estrogen is not kept in mind. Qualitative differences in the oxidative metabolites of estrogens may be of significance with respect to oncogenic potential.\r"

The first study was an observational study in oral contraceptive users who took either a combination of gestodene and ethinyl estradiol (pill A, Femovan) or desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (pill B, Marvelon). A total of 69 women (39 receiving pill A and 30 receiving pill B) were evaluated to determine serum ethinyl estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and cortisol levels. Samples were obtained on 1 day during the tenth to twenty-first days of pill intake. All women received the respective oral contraceptive for at least 3 months. The test power was such that an 80% difference of 1 standard deviation of each target variable would have been detected (alpha = 0.05; beta = 0.1). No statistically significant differences were found in sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, or cortisol serum levels between both groups. Time and height of maximum ethinyl estradiol levels were identical as was the area under the curves. Ex vivo protein-binding analysis of the progestins revealed a free portion of 0.6% for gestodene and 2.5% for 3-ketodesogestrel as the active metabolite of desogestrel. Sex hormone-binding globulin-bound portions were much higher for gestodene (75.3% +/- 9.1%) than for 3-ketodesogestrel (31.6% +/- 12%). The remaining fractions were bound to albumin. In a second study, ethinyl estradiol-bioequivalence from pills A and B was investigated in 18 women in a controlled, single-dose, randomized, crossover design. The area under the ethinyl estradiol serum levels were identical up to 4 hours after pill intake between both treatments. According to the relatively low variation in data in this group of women, a 10% difference in ethinyl estradiol-availability could have been detected. Both studies indicate that the pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol were independent of the concomitantly administered progestin, that is, desogestel and gestodene.\r"

Women at risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance while receiving high-dose oral contraceptives either had previous gestational diabetes mellitus or were older, obese, or had a positive family history of diabetes mellitus. The tendency to decreased glucose tolerance seems essentially related to the dosage and chemical structure of the progestogen used in oral contraceptives, namely, estrane and particularly gonane progestins. However, increased frequency of impaired glucose tolerance and potentially diabetes mellitus are obviously not linked to the use of the more potent gonane progestins. The use of low-dose oral contraceptives, particularly with reduced progestogen content (such as in the triphasic formulations and last-generation monophasic preparations), is accompanied by a low risk of impaired glucose tolerance, even in previous gestational diabetes mellitus. The mechanism of decreased glucose tolerance in oral contraceptive users is unknown but seems related partially to increased peripheral resistance that is potentially caused by a postreceptor defect in insulin action. Changes in insulin production or metabolic clearance rate are not excluded by recent, sophisticated investigations of carbohydrate metabolism in oral contraceptive users. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus, chronic hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia are believed to increase atherogenic risk either by their direct action or their effects on lipid metabolism. Newer epidemiologic studies now indicate that the incidence of cardiovascular disease in low-dose, low-risk, current oral contraceptive users has been substantially decreased. The use of low-dose oral contraceptives with reduced dosages of better adapted progestogens seems effective in decreasing alterations in carbohydrate metabolism and may thereby contribute to decrease further atherogenic risk in oral contraceptive users.\r"

  ".W": "Although the available scientific data on the undesired metabolic effects of sex steroids have accumulated rapidly, most are of a descriptive nature, and only a few studies elucidate the impact at the cellular level and the possible interrelationship between different metabolic systems. This review summarizes the influence of different contraceptive steroid combinations on glucose metabolism and points to the possible mechanisms behind a disturbance of the euglycemic homeostasis with a concomitant change in lipid metabolism. Today the general concept is that the influence of combined sex steroid products on glucose metabolism is mainly caused by the progestogen components, although artificial estrogens may act synergistically. The diabetogenic effects of the progestogens make it important to consider the development during the last decade of the new more selective progestogens of the gonane type. From recent studies it seems, however, that intake of contraceptive combinations of ethinyl estradiol in combination with these types of gonanes, such as desogestrel and gestodene, may also be accompanied by increased insulin resistance, specifically, a hyperinsulinemic response to a glucose challenge despite unchanged glucose values compared with a baseline test. This is similar to observations made with combinations of ethinyl estradiol and other more traditional types of progestogens of the gonane and estrane type. It is conceivable that the diabetogenic effects of the progestogens are caused by a change in insulin receptor binding or a postreceptor defect in the cellular insulin action. The clinical implications of the diabetogenic effects of the sex steroids are hard to interpret, but more long-term exposure of arterial tissue to elevated concentrations of glucose and insulin results in inhibition of lipolysis and synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides, which result in the development of lipid-filled lesions--fatty streaks--similar to those of early atherosclerosis.\r"

Although increased risk of overt symptoms of diabetes has not been associated with oral contraceptive use, increased risk of coronary heart disease has been consistently demonstrated. Diabetes is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease, especially in women. Elevated plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are also associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Studies of the effects of low-dose oral contraceptives on glucose tolerance test plasma glucose and insulin levels are reviewed. Low-dose combined oral contraceptives induced changes in measures of carbohydrate metabolism in directions consistent with increased risk of coronary heart disease. The magnitude of these changes may depend on the dose and type of progestogen. The clinical implications of these changes are unknown, but it would seem advisable to minimize them where possible.\r"

Most of the data relate to older preparations little used today. Decreased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased amounts of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were common findings with the older formulations. More recent experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that the potential risk of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users is hardly predicated on an arteriosclerosis basis but related more to thromboembolic events. Because changes in the serum lipid profile are often associated with alterations in the factors of hemostasis, it seems reasonable to suggest the use of preparations void of profound changes in lipid metabolism, especially when other means of efficacy are available inclusive of the newer low-dose oral contraceptives. When risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present, determination of total cholesterol is desirable. In subjects with elevated serum cholesterol, a serum lipid profile should be determined. A woman at risk of cardiovascular disease should be carefully monitored, and repeated lipid determinations are recommended.\r"

At baseline, 6, and 12 months, blood glucose, plasma insulin, and plasma C-peptide levels were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test. Although the changes were absent (Marvelon) or minimal (Diane-35) at 6 months, both groups had a slight increase in blood glucose levels at 12 months; overall glucose tolerance remaining, however, within the normal range. Plasma insulin levels remained unchanged in the Diane-35-group, which suggested increased insulin resistance, but were significantly decreased in the Marvelon group despite significant rises in plasma C-peptide levels. Comparison of plasma C-peptide and insulin changes suggests enhanced pancreatic insulin secretion and increased hepatic insulin metabolism with both Marvelon and Diane-35.\r"

  ".W": "In a cross-sectional study that aimed to identify risk factors for diabetes, 1290 consecutive, healthy, nonpregnant women of child-bearing age were examined in a center for preventive medicine. An in-depth interview about menses, use of oral contraceptives, and menopause was performed. Plasma glucose at fasting and 2 hours after a 75 gm glucose load, glycated hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma insulin, total plasma cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. Compared with nonusers taking no progestogens, oral contraceptive users (n = 431; 33.4%) were younger (p less than 0.001) and leaner (p less than 0.001). After adjustment for age and body mass index, oral contraceptive users had higher 2-hour plasma glucose (p less than 0.001), higher fasting plasma insulin (p less than 0.01), and higher triglycerides levels (p less than 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, and total cholesterol did not significantly differ between the two groups. In relation to dosage and types of steroid components, few differences have been found between high-dose and low-dose oral contraceptives or according to the estrogen-progestogen balance of the preparations. Use of oral contraceptives appears to induce an increase of insulin-resistance markers, which have recently been cited as risk factors for ischemic vascular diseases. These markers should be carefully monitored in oral contraceptive users.\r"

These changes are then probably without any clinical relevance because there is no evidence in the huge volume of oral contraceptive and cardiovascular literature that the use of oral contraceptives promotes or retards the development of atherosclerotic disease. What may appear to be favorable changes in the lipid profile attributed to oral contraceptive use may actually be associated with unfavorable changes in other parameters, such as the balance of clotting and fibrinolytic factors. A well-balanced, low-dose oral contraceptive formulation should alter any of the cardiovascular risk indicators as little as possible in either a supposedly positive or negative direction.\r"

  ".W": "Epidemiologic evidence has established that oral contraceptives increase the risk of both arterial and venous thromboembolic disease. This is dose related in the case of the estrogen component for both arterial and venous events and in the case of progestogens for arterial events. It is probable that the increased rate of thromboembolic events caused by estrogen is related to hypercoagulability. Plasma levels of several clotting factors have been shown to be elevated in oral contraceptive users, and this increase is graduated according to the dose of estrogen. In pregnancy, factor VIIc is increased after cold activation of plasma at 4 degrees C overnight. Likewise, in users of oral contraceptives, both factors VIIc and XIIc are increased, which suggests a direct effect of factor XIIc on the extrinsic system. In men, the risk of ischemic heart disease is strongly and independently related to factor VIIc and fibrinogen levels; thus it is possible that in women taking oral contraceptives, the mechanism of risk is similarly mediated. There is a good case for factor VIIc as the index of flux in the coagulation system and hence of a hypercoagulable state, and indeed it may directly contribute to the generation of thrombin. This article examines the available evidence on clotting factor activity in the risk of cardiovascular disease in oral contraceptive users.\r"

  ".W": "Oral contraceptives influence plasma proteins, causing changes in plasma procoagulants and fibrinolytic effectors. Estrogen is thought to be responsible for these changes, whereas progestogens, in particular those with an androgenic effect, may influence the magnitude of the changes. This concept is consistent with epidemiologic studies, suggesting a correlation between estrogen dose and cardiovascular episodes in oral contraceptive users. A delayed resolution of fibrin might contribute to an increased risk caused by decreased coagulation inhibition or fibrinolytic efficacy. Estrogen (30 micrograms or more) has a dose-dependent effect on clotting factors, including antithrombin III and proteins C and S. The effect of high- and low-dose oral contraceptives containing various progestogens on the fibrinolytic system is less clear. We have found that low-dose oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel or lynestrenol enhance fibrinolysis, as revealed by an increase in plasminogen (30% to 40%), a decrease in histidine-rich glycoprotein (15% to 26%), an increase in tissue plasminogen activator activity (greater than 150%), and a decrease in tissue plasminogen activator inhibition (30% to 40%), concomitant with a slight decrease in tissue plasminogen activator antigen level (15% to 20%). New oral contraceptives contain less androgenic progestogens. Preliminary results of an ongoing study of women receiving either 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol with 150 micrograms of desogestrel or 30 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol plus 75 micrograms of gestodene revealed no change or changes similar to the older low-dose preparations after 6 months of treatment. Of particular importance was the finding that coagulation activation, expressed by the levels of thrombin-antithrombin III-complexes, fibrin formation, and the efficacy of fibrinolysis, expressed by the levels of fibrin degradation products, was identical in the two groups.\r"

The goal then is to prescribe \"safer pills.\" One should also allow for biologic variation in pharmacokinetics and end-organ responses. This can be done to a limited extent in clinical practice by using bleeding from the uterus as a \"threshold bioassay.\" Namely, by identifying for each woman the lowest dose of a chosen estrogen-progestogen combination that is just sufficient to prevent breakthrough bleeding. Thereafter, monitoring requires attention to the development of new risk factors, regular blood pressure checks, and specific attention to the important side effects of headaches and migraines, especially if there are focal (cerebral ischemic) symptoms.\r"

Cellular RNA was prepared directly from the blood or bone marrow smears using a modified RNA extraction procedure. cDNA was synthesized from RNA and amplified with PCR using bcr and abl-specific primers. Using this procedure, the bcr-abl fusion gene was detected by PCR in 21 of 21 patients with CML. Three patients who had undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for CML were also studied by PCR. bcr-abl was identified transiently in one patient, persisted in one patient after BMT for 2 years until relapse occurred, and was absent in one patient to 18 months after BMT. We have shown that PCR can detect the bcr-abl gene of CML using material from glass-slide smears.

The detection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) along with quantitative DNA ploidy analysis, also was performed on the same breast cancers. The results indicated two subgroups of invasive ductal carcinoma; 1) HER-2/neu overexpressing cases that were negative for EGFR expression and had low proliferation fraction, and a tetraploid DNA pattern (22 cases), and 2) other combinations of HER-2/neu expression and EGFR expression, with a high proliferation fraction and an aneuploid DNA pattern (38 cases). Eight cases of carcinoma in situ were positive for HER-2/neu overexpression and negative for EGFR expression, and had a high proliferation fraction and a tetraploid DNA pattern.

The GBM antigens recognized by nephrotoxic antibodies (NTAbs) have not been identified conclusively. Our experiments presented here, however, showed that NTAbs did not significantly reduce binding of anti-laminin IgGs to laminin-coated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates or to the GBM in vivo, indicating little cross-reactivity between the NTAbs and laminin. To evaluate possible changes in GBM architecture during acute stages of NTN, the ultrastructural distribution of laminin was determined by postfixation, postembedding immunogold labeling, and compared between normal and nephritic rats. The density of immunoreactive GBM laminin was significantly reduced in rats with acute NTN. In addition, conjugates of anti-laminin IgG and horseradish peroxidase were intravenously injected into rats that then received injections of NTAbs. Anti-laminin peroxidase conjugates were also injected after administering NTAbs. In both cases, an overall decrease in anti-laminin peroxidase reaction product was observed as compared to normal controls. The densest labeling was seen in the lamina rara interna, especially in areas of endothelial cell detachment. Some immunoperoxidase reaction product was also bound to basal surfaces of detaching endothelial cells, demonstrating the removal of at least some laminin from the GBM. A decrease in GBM binding of intravenously injected anti-laminin IgG, both before and after injection of rats with NTAbs, was also confirmed by postembedding immunogold labeling. Furthermore, morphometry showed that the GBM was significantly wider in nephritic rats than in controls, indicating a redistribution of laminin over a greatly increased area. These immunoultrastructural findings show, therefore, that GBM architecture is altered in the early phase of NTN.\r"

These eosinophils were examined ultrastructurally and stereologically for alterations in the volume density (Vv) of their electron-dense granules, the Vv of their lucent granules, the Vv of their lipid droplets, the numerical density of their granules with respect to cytoplasm (Nv), and the plasma membrane surface area-to-cell volume ratio (Sv) that might account for their decreased sedimentation density. The hypodense eosinophils that were obtained from the two patients with IHES exhibited a one-third reduction in granule Vv relative to normodense eosinophils from control donors, primarily because of a decrease in granule size. The culture-derived hypodense eosinophils exhibited 10% to 16% decreases in their granule Vv, significant increases in their lucent granules, and a approximately 7.5% decrease in their Sv. Calculation of the cell volume from cross-sectional area measurements showed that the eosinophils that had been cocultured with fibroblasts in the presence of GM-CSF increased their volume by approximately 15%. The eosinophils that had been cocultured with endothelial cells exocytosed some of their granules. In conclusion, a composite of factors including cell swelling, a decrease in the volume of the cytoplasm occupied by granules, and an increase in granule lucency contributes to the hypodense phenotype in vitro, but only cell swelling and hypogranulation are seen in cells from patients with IHES. The latter could reflect the response of 'primed' hypodense eosinophils in vivo to pertinent tissue ligands.\r"

There was no difference between the proportion of persons with P. falciparum (asexuals or gametocytes) and P. vivax whose sera inhibited Mab binding, but all 3 categories had a significantly higher proportion of inhibitors than persons who were malaria negative. The amount of gametocyte antibody recognizing epitopes on Pfs 48/45 and Pfs 230 increased with increasing numbers of previous malaria episodes. The proportion of sera from these relatively nonimmune adults which had gamete antibodies was similar to the proportion seen in sera from a highly endemic area, suggesting that antibody responses to these epitopes are a part of the initial response observed after a limited number of malaria episodes.\r"

The test is based on the inhibition of chloroquine efflux by verapamil; it is performed by diluting infected blood in culture medium and incubating the diluted blood for 60 min at 37 degrees C with 50 nM 3H-chloroquine, with and without 10 microM verapamil. The test can be performed with the ring stage parasites in the blood of infected patients and in the presence of white cells, platelets and anticoagulants (heparin, EDTA, or citrate). Although the test can be performed in triplicate with 20 microliters of blood and specimens may be kept in anticoagulants at 4 degrees C for up to 24 hr, parasitemias less than 0.1% limit the sensitivity of the assay. Inhibition of chloroquine efflux by verapamil may permit the rapid identification of chloroquine resistant P. falciparum in blood specimens from infected patients.\r"

This vaccine was tested in 13 naive volunteers at doses of 10-1,000 micrograms. No serious adverse reactions were noted. None of 4 volunteers receiving the 10 micrograms dose developed antibodies measurable by ELISA. Six of 9 volunteers in the other dose groups developed measurable antibodies: 5 of 5 volunteers receiving 100 micrograms and 1 of 4 receiving 1,000 micrograms. Antibody responses measured by immunofluorescence assays paralleled those seen by ELISA. None of the volunteers developed antisera that inhibited sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro. Lack of a classical anamnestic response and lack of a typical dose response to increasing amounts of antigen suggests the possible presence of an immunosuppressive epitope in the repetitive region of the CS protein.\r"

A quantitative relationship between the number of sporozoites and the number of EE merozoites produced was established. The reduction in the number of merozoites was used as an assay of drug activity. The ED50 of primaquine, 3.7-3.9 x 10(-6) M, was the concentration of drug that reduced the number of merozoites to 50% of controls. Several of the primaquine metabolites were much more potent than primaquine, with ED50s as low as 2 x 10(-7) M. Metabolites containing the 4-amino-1-methylbutyl side chain were most effective in vitro. Superoxide generation was measured for the various metabolites. In general, superoxide generation did not correlate with antimalarial activity. However, for the 3 metabolites with 4-amino-1-methylbutyl side chains, there was a correlation between superoxide generation and antimalarial activity.\r"

The same monoclonal antibody and the same sera were used in both tests. In the Dot-ELISA, 67 of 70 sera from microfilaremic donors were deemed to contain filarial antigens when screened at a dilution of 1:50. End titers were 1:80-1:1280. With the Sandwich-ELISA, 64 of the same sera were positive at a dilution of 1:10 and 42 were positive at a dilution of 1:50. End titers were 1:10-1:320. The specificity of both assays was greater than 95%, but their sensitivity was remarkably different. The Dot-ELISA could detect as little as 0.055 ng/ml microfilarial antigen added to normal human sera, whereas the lower limit with the Sandwich-ELISA was 10 ng/ml parasite antigen. Additionally, the Dot-ELISA does not require radioactivity or sophisticated equipment and, therefore, can be performed in virtually all filariasis-endemic areas.\r"

Cellular metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis as measured by DNA, RNA and protein synthesis are not requires. Proteolytic enzymes eliminate virus fusion only when the uninfected cells involved in the process are treated. Since the CD4 protein remains on the surface of the treated cells, the structure of this receptor must be changed sufficiently so that it cannot participate in the fusion process. Alternatively, the results may indicate the elimination by trypsin of a specific fusion receptor.\r"

Saliva samples were assayed for HIV-1 antibodies with IgA-specific Western blot. The samples from 10 out of 11 children with subsequently proven infection, including one aged 6 months, demonstrated IgA antibodies to HIV-1 envelope antigens. Samples from infants under 15 months, who were born to infected mothers and subsequently shown to be uninfected, were slgA negative. Of the 12 children with continued indeterminate HIV-1 status, eight showed neither slgA nor serologic evidence of infection and four showed slgA antibodies. HIV-1-specific slgA was detectable before the age of 15 months and may prove to be valuable in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants.\r"

There was a significant increase in serum beta 2-M levels, irrespective of the response to treatment. However, the increase of serum beta 2-M levels in responders appeared to be more pronounced than in those with progressive disease, but this difference was not significant. The increase was only found during the initial 8 weeks; thereafter, beta 2-M levels declined in patients with continuing clinical improvement during ongoing treatment with IFN alpha. This may have been related to IFN alpha dose modification at 8 weeks for all patients. The initial rise in serum beta 2-M might be related to the immunomodulation properties of IFN alpha. Because serum beta 2-M levels were also enhanced in non-responders, this rise does not demonstrate that immunomodulation by IFN alpha is a mechanism of anti-tumour activity in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "Most of the small increased risk in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) associated with the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) appears to be caused by bacterial contamination of the endometrial cavity at the time of insertion. This randomized clinical trial of 1813 women in Nairobi, Kenya, assessed the effectiveness of 200 mg of doxycycline given orally at the time of insertion in reducing the occurrence of PID. The rate of this infection in the doxycycline-treated group was 31% lower than that in the placebo-treated group (1.3 and 1.9%, respectively; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.5). The rate of an unplanned IUCD-related visit to the clinic was also 31% lower in the doxycycline-treated group (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). Although the significance level (P = 0.17) for the reduction is PID does not meet the conventional standard of 0.05, the results may be suggestive of an effect. Moreover, the reduction in IUCD-related visits (P = 0.004) not only represents an important decrease in morbidity but also substantiates the reduction found for PID. Further studies are needed to corroborate these results. Consideration should be given to the prophylactic use of doxycycline at the time of IUCD insertion as an approach to preventing PID and other IUCD-related morbidity.\r"

Conversely, in 66 of 80 pregnancies the absence of a notch was associated with the livebirth of an infant beyond 32 weeks gestation, with a birthweight above the 5th centile. It is suggested that the presence of a notch in the uterine artery FVW is a good predictor of poor perinatal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the long term effects of relaxation therapy on 24 hour ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure in patients with mild untreated and uncomplicated hypertension. DESIGN--Four week screening period followed by randomisation to receive either relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling for one year. Ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure was measured before and after treatment. SETTING--Outpatient clinic in Amsterdam's university hospital. SUBJECTS--35 Subjects aged 20-60 who were being treated by general practitioners for hypertension but were referred to take part in the study. At three consecutive screening visits all subjects had a diastolic blood pressure without treatment of 95-110 mm Hg. Subjects were excluded if they had damaged target organs, secondary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a cholesterol concentration greater than 8 mmol/l, or a history of malignant hypertension. INTERVENTIONS--The group allocated to relaxation therapy was trained for eight weeks (one hour a week) in muscle relaxation, yoga exercises, and stress management and continued exercising twice daily for one year with monthly visits to the clinic. The control group had the same attendance schedule but had no training and were requested just to sit and relax twice a day. All subjects were asked not to change their diet or physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Changes in ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure after one year of relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling. RESULTS--Mean urinary sodium excretion, serum concentration of cholesterol, and body weight did not change in either group. Diastolic pressures measured by sphygmomanometry were 2 and 3 mm Hg lower in subjects in the relaxation group and control group respectively at the one year follow up compared with initial readings. The mean diastolic ambulatory intra-arterial pressure during the daytime had not changed after one year in either group, but small treatment effects could not be excluded: the mean change for the relaxation group was -1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -6 to 3.9 mm Hg) and for the control group -0.4 mm Hg (-5.3 to 4.6 mm Hg). Mean ambulatory pressure in the evening also had not changed over the year, and in both groups nighttime pressure was 5 mm Hg higher. The variability in blood pressure was the same at both measurements. CONCLUSIONS--Relaxation therapy was an ineffective method of lowering 24 hour blood pressure, being no more beneficial than non-specific advice, support, and reassurance--themselves ineffective as a treatment for hypertension.\r"

PATIENTS--149 Children aged 4-9 years who were admitted for surgery for glue ear and who had no history of previous operations on tonsils, adenoids, or ears and no evidence of sensorineural deafness. Inadequate follow up information on levels of hearing and on middle ear function was obtained from 22. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mean hearing loss (dB) of the three worst heard frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz, results of impedance tympanometry, and parental views on their child's progress. RESULTS--In the 127 children for whom adequate information was available ears in which a grommet had been inserted performed better in the short term (for at least six months) than those in which no grommet had been inserted, irrespective of any accompanying procedure. Most of the benefit had disappeared by 12 months. Adenoidectomy produced a slight improvement that was not significant, though was sustained for at least two years. The ears of children who had had an adenoidectomy with myringotomy and grommet insertion, however, continued to improve so that two years after surgery about 50% had abnormal tympanometry compared with 83% of those who had had only myringotomy and grommet insertion, and 93% of the group that had had no treatment. Logistic regression analyses identified preoperative hearing level as the single best predictor of good outcome from surgery. Other variables contributed little additional predictive power. CONCLUSIONS--If the principal objective of surgery for glue ear is to restore hearing then our study shows that insertion of grommets is the treatment of choice. The addition of an adenoidectomy will increase the likelihood of restoration of normal function of the middle ear but will not improve hearing. When deciding appropriate indications for surgery, a balance has to be made between performing unnecessary operations and failing to treat patients who might benefit from surgical intervention. Preoperative audiometry scores might be the best predictor in helping to make this decision.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the efficacy of a single dose of doxycycline (200 or 300 mg) with the standard multiple doses of tetracycline in patients with cholera. DESIGN--Randomised double blind controlled trial. Patients were given a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline, a single 300 mg dose of doxycycline, or multiple doses of tetracycline (500 mg, six hourly intervals). SETTING--Hospital in Bangladesh treating diarrhoea. PATIENTS--261 Patients aged over 15 admitted to the hospital with severe dehydration due to acute watery diarrhoea associated with Vibrio cholerae. All vibrios isolated from the stools and rectal swabs of patients, including those patients with prolonged excretion of vibrios, were sensitive to tetracycline. The stools of all patients at admission were negative for shigella and salmonella. INTERVENTIONS--All patients received rapid intravenous acetate solution for the first four hours after admission to hospital. They were then entered in the study and randomised. Oral rehydration was started immediately after the intravenous treatment. If signs of severe dehydration reappeared during oral treatment patients were given rapid intravenous acetate solution until dehydration was fully corrected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Stool output in first 24 hours and till diarrhoea stopped, total intake of oral rehydration fluid, duration of diarrhoea, and excretion of vibrio after receiving antibiotic treatment. RESULTS--The median stool outputs during the first 24 hours (275 ml/kg body weight) and till diarrhoea stopped (296 ml/kg body weight) were significantly higher in patients receiving 200 mg doxycycline as a single dose than in patients receiving either standard tetracycline (242 ml/kg body weight and 254 ml/kg body weight) or 300 mg doxycycline (226 ml/kg body weight and 255 ml/kg body weight). Similarly, median consumption of oral rehydration solution (18.45 l) was significantly higher in patients receiving 200 mg doxycycline than in patients receiving either 300 mg doxycycline (16.10 l) or standard tetracycline (14.80 l). Almost equal numbers of patients in each group required unscheduled intravenous acetate solution to correct dehydration during antibiotic treatment. Patients treated with doxycycline (low or high dose), however, had more prolonged excretion of bacteria. CONCLUSIONS--A single 300 mg dose of doxycycline is as effective as the standard multiple dose tetracycline treatment for cholera in terms of stool output, duration of diarrhoea, vomiting, and requirement for oral rehydration solution.\r"

Transperineal prostatic biopsies taken under transrectal ultrasound control were examined for antibody, complement (C3) and fibrinogen deposition using a direct immunofluorescence (IF) technique; 34 patients (57%) had prostatic tissue that displayed IF staining compared with only 1 (5%) in the non-prostatitis group. IF staining for IgM was found in 85%, for C3 in 44%, for IgA in 35% and for fibrinogen in 24%, but the IgG subclass was not detected. Antibody deposition was mainly periglandular and glandular and in the wall of vessels. Five symptoms, particularly poor urinary flow, irritative voiding and urgency, were significantly correlated with IgM and C3 deposition and, to a lesser extent, fibrinogen deposition. The aetiology of chronic abacterial prostatitis remains obscure but several possible mechanisms are discussed. The link between symptomatology and immunology could rest with functional outflow obstruction causing intraprostatic reflux of urine, this in turn inciting an immunological response, the inducing antigens being organism remnants or products, urinary constituents or autoantibodies.\r"

The immunmoreactive tumor volume was determined morphometrically. The tumor types showed a different pattern of HLA expressions. In squamous cell carcinomas (SQC) and small cell carcinomas (SCC) the HLA-A,B,C expression varied in a great range from 0% to 100% of positive tumor volume. For the most part, HLA-DR was not demonstrable. In adenocarcinomas (AC) and large cell carcinomas two different populations were observed. One showed a pattern of HLA expression as seen in SQC. Electron microscopically these AC (type 1) (AC/1) were characterized by intracytoplasmic mucin granules indicating a phenotypical relationship to goblet cells. The other--nearly 50% of adenocarcinomas and one third of large cell carcinomas--expressed both HLA antigens homogeneously in the total tumor volume. Electron microscopically the characteristics of type II pneumocytes and Clara cells were seen in tumor cells of these AC (type II) (AC/II), consisting in lamellar bodies and apically located electron-dense granules. In SQC and AC/I a significant correlation was found between grades of differentiation and mitotic activity on the one side, and expression of HLA-A,B,C on the otrher. The loss of HLA-A,B,C expression seemed to be an indication of a lower grade of differentiation; the smalles expression of HLA-A,B,C occurred in SCC.\r"

The epitope is carried on glycoprotein components with molecular weights of 160, 125 and 115 kilodaltons. The authors examined the immunohistochemical expression of G71 antigen, using a standard indirect immunoperoxidase technique, in benign and malignant tumors derived from the epidermis. G71 staining was consistently absent or reduced around basal cell carcinomas (n = 44). In contrast, G71 was present at the basement membrane zone of squamous cell carcinomas (n = 18) and was also frequently expressed within the cytoplasm and on the cell surface of the malignant keratinocytes. The staining pattern of G71 at the basement membrane zone was essentially normal in keratoacanthomas (n = 10), solar keratoses (n = apart from foci of attenuation. In both seborrheic keratoses and intraepidermal squamous 13), seborrheic keratoses (n = 6), and intraepidermal squamous cell carcinomas (n = 8), cell carcinomas cell-surface and cytoplasmic staining were inconstant features. In conclusion, there appears to be a specific defect of G71 antigen expression in basal cell carcinomas.\r"

Among 103 neuroblastomas in which N-myc was measured, ten were Stage IV-S (eight children were younger than and two were older than 1 year of age). The number of copies of N-myc was 1 to 3 in five patients, four to ten in one patient, and more than ten in four patients, and the survivors of each group were four, one, and one (recurrent), respectively. Of 41 patients younger than 1 year of age, N-myc amplification of more than three copies was found only in Stage IV-S neuroblastoma. Cure with a tendency to regress spontaneously was seen in five of eight patients younger than 1 year of age. However, two patients older than 1 year of age classified as Stage IV-S (one with N-myc amplification) died of progressive disease. In two patients (1 and 3 months of age) with a huge hepatic involvement and in whom the tumor had an amplified N-myc of more than ten copies, tumor regression occurred but there was a relapse to a progressive state later. The overexpression of N-myc mRNA occurred in nine of ten stage IV-S tumors and did not correlate with the prognosis. The vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) to homovanillic acid (HVA) ratio was low in tumors with an increased number of copies of N-myc. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were increased in Stage IV-S patients with N-myc amplification but not in those with regressing tumors and without N-myc amplification. These data suggest that N-myc amplification may affect the final outcome in the patient classified as Stage IV-S, but tumor regression can occur early after birth and appears to be independent of N-myc amplification.\r"

The tumor extract was found to contain parathyroid (PTH)-like activity. Significant amounts of colony stimulating factor (CSF), which was further defined to be GM-CSF, and interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) were detected in the conditioned media. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to the HTC/C3 showed rich EGF receptors. Furthermore, the conditioned medium inhibited the binding of 125I-mEGF to HeLa cells, and transforming growth factor (TGF) was found repeatedly in the media.\r"

  ".W": "The sinusoids of 30 human hepatocellular carcinomas of various types were examined by electron microscopy and histochemically for binding to the Ulex europaeus lectin (UEA1). A population of sinusoidal macrophages was identified with an antibody to lysozyme (muramidase). The UEA1 binding was negative in normal sinusoids but positive in the tumor vessels. Macrophages resembling Kupffer cells were found within the tumor vessels but in smaller numbers than in either normal or cirrhotic liver tissue. Fibrolamellar and sclerosing carcinomas contained the smallest numbers. Ultrastructurally, endothelial cells of tumor vessels were thicker than normal, with fewer fenestrations. They contained bundles of microfilaments and showed basement membrane formation. Subendothelial myoid cells were found. These findings indicate that the sinusoidal vessels of hepatocellular carcinomas show features of true capillaries and precapillary blood vessels. The degree of this difference from normal hepatic sinusoids may reflect the relative immaturity of the cancer cells.\r"

  ".W": "The frequency of stromal activation and its possible relation to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or HCG-like secretion by tumor cells has been studied in 100 nonselected, consecutive, primary and secondary ovarian neoplasms. Stromal luteinization was present in 13 cases and stromal condensation in 16. The types of tumors most commonly associated with activation of the ovarian stroma were as follows: mucinous tumors (11 cases), endometrioid and clear cell tumors (six cases), and metastasis of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (six cases). We used to commercial polyclonal antibodies as well as four more specific monoclonal antibodies (FBT-10, FBT-11, FB-12, and FB-13). Immunohistochemical studies (peroxidase-antiperoxidase [PAP]) yielded the following staining results: polyclonal HCG and/or polyclonal beta-HCG positivity was present in 22 tumors (12 had an activated stroma and ten an inactive one). In addition, 44 tumors were positive for FBT-10, FBT-11, FB-12, and FB-13 monoclonal antibodies (18 showed activation of the stroma, which was inactive in 26). Only 11 of the 56 HCG-negative tumors exhibited activation of the stroma. Thus, positivity for HCG was more frequently found in tumors with morphologically active stroma than in those with an inactive one. However, five HCG polyclonal positive tumors--three of them exhibiting activation of the stroma--were negative for the monoclonal antibodies. It appears that HCG plays a role in the activation of the stroma of some ovarian tumors, yet, HCG-like substances as well as other factors may also be involved.\r"

The cultured tumor cells retained growth characteristics as well as ultrastructural and immunohistochemical properties similar to the cells of the primary tumor. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a modal range in the diploid-hypodiploid region, a finding which was corroborated by quantitative DNA determinations of both the primary tumor and a lymph node metastasis. Fourteen different marker chromosomes were identified. The most frequent clonal rearrangement was a 1p-marker resulting from a short arm terminal deletion, i.e., del (1) (p21-22). A similar 1p- marker has previously been observed in an established epithelioid sarcoma cell line. The finding of an apparently identical 1p-marker in two of two analyzed epithelioid sarcomas suggests that this rearrangement may be a primary cytogenetic abnormality in epithelioid sarcoma. An elevated ras p21 expression was demonstrated using immunohistochemical methods. The possible involvement of the N-ras gene and/or a tumor suppressor in the 1p deletion is considered.\r"

The tumor was sited in the midportion of the left lobe of the thyroid, and histologically it showed both squamous features and mucin production. The squamous cells were arranged in solid sheets with horny pearls and the mucous cells tended to line dilated duct-like elements. Ultrastructurally, the epidermoid cells had aggregates of tonofilaments and well-developed desmosomal attachments, and the mucous cells contained numerous mucin granules in their cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that cytokeratin antibodies showed positivity for both the lining cells and squamous cells, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen positivity was found in the lining cells and intraluminal material. The tumor cells were negative for thyroglobulin, calcitonin, vimentin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase. These unusual histologic and immunohistochemical features are suggestive of a tumor related to the so-called \"solid cell nest\" of the thyroid.\r"

Cell densities were assessed on cryostat sections (alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase-technique) of the respective diagnostic biopsy specimens. Additionally, two clinical parameters (age, stage of disease) were evaluated. CD1a-positive epidermal cells were demonstrated to be the only cell population being significantly associated (P = 0.011) with survival. Death resulting from mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome was significantly (P = 0.003) less frequent in patients with epidermal CD1a-positive cell densities higher than 90 cells/mm2 (optimal break point) as compared with patients with lower numbers. These results suggest that Langerhans' cells have a significant impact on prognosis of patients with mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. They play an important role in the host defense mechanisms against these lymphomas rather than to favor their progression as proposed recently.\r"

After a prolonged fast (mean fast 14 hr), gastric fluid volume was 0.39 +/- 0.37 ml.kg-1 and gastric pH was 1.7 +/- 0.4; after unlimited clear fluids (203 +/- 109 ml) up to three hours before surgery gastric fluid volume was 0.34 +/- 0.28 ml.kg-1 and gastric pH was 1.8 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SD). Gastric fluid volume (ml.kg-1) increased in both the control and study groups as age increased, P less than 0.005.

Neonates were assessed by Apgar scores, neurologic and adapative capacity scores (NACS) and umbilical cord blood gas analysis. Haemodynamic changes were similar immediately following induction but the low propofol infusion group had the best haemodynamic stability subsequently. Recovery times were fastest in the low-infusion group but there were no differences in later postbox testing. Neonatal Apgar scores and umbilical blood gas analysis were similar but NACS at two hours were poorer in the high infusion group. A propofol infusion coupled with nitrous oxide appears to be a satisfactory technique for Caesarean section.\r"

Thirty healthy, unpremedicated patients were studied. Thiopentone requirements were reduced by 40 and 28 per cent in the S and LS groups respectively compared with control (P less than 0.001). Both treatments suppressed HR and BP responses (P less than 0.005) to intubation. Postoperatively, PaCO2 was elevated (P less than 0.05) in group S. Dose-related respiratory depression was observed. The incidence of postoperative apnoea was significantly higher in both S and LS groups than compared with control (P less than 0.05). However, only patients in group S showed higher apnoea index and mean apnoea duration over the initial 10-20 min after surgery compared with control (P less than 0.005). In addition, group S showed slower respiratory frequency and prolonged expiratory time (P less than 0.005). In conclusion, an induction dose of sufentanil (1 microgram.kg-1) used in balanced anaesthesia of less than 70 min duration was associated with significant respiratory depression, particularly during the initial 10-20 min after surgery, whereas low-dose sufentanil (0.5 micrograms.kg-1) with lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) had minimal postoperative respiratory depression and comparable attenuation of pressor responses to intubation.\r"

Intrathecal injection of the anaesthetic agent was given with the patient in the sitting position in which he remained for ten minutes before being placed in the lithotomy position. The onset time for sensory blockade was seven minutes in the lidocaine group and ten minutes in the meperidine group. Final sensory levels were identical in both groups. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly in the lidocaine group but not in the meperidine group. Motor block was absent in ten patients in the meperidine group but was present in all the patients in the lidocaine group. Duration of postoperative analgesia was 968 min in the meperidine group and 681 min in the lidocaine group (NS). Complications such as nausea, vomiting, itching, drowsiness and respiratory depression were similar in the two groups. It is concluded that low-dose meperidine, 0.5 mg.kg-1, is effective as a spinal anaesthetic agent and has few complications.\r"

She had previously undergone several uneventful surgical procedures. Forty-five minutes following induction of anaesthesia and during laparotomy for elective cholecystectomy she experienced sudden onset of increased airway pressure, oxygen desaturation, tachycardia, profound hypotension and erythema consistent with an anaphylactic reaction. Resuscitation with manual ventilation and oxygen, intravenous fluids and an epinephrine infusion was successful. Subsequent investigations for allergies demonstrated a strongly positive skin prick test and RAST to latex antigen, with negative results to anaesthetic agents, antibiotics and inhalant allergens. During two later operations prophylaxis consisting of diphenhydramine, ranitidine and hydrocortisone appeared to prevent further reactions. Latex should be considered as a cause of life-threatening intraoperative allergic reactions in patients with a history of rubber allergy or frequent exposure to latex products.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of lesion morphology is becoming increasingly important in the study of coronary artery disease. Lesion irregularity has been shown to be one of the most important predictive features for development of myocardial infarction. Most studies to date have used only qualitative assessments of morphology and are thus subject to variability and lack of standardization inherent in subjective visual inspection. We describe a new approach that allows quantitation of lesion morphology. Fifty-nine patients with unstable angina and 17 patients with stable angina were compared. Five morphometric parameters were tested (peaks per centimeter, summed maximum error per centimeter, integrated error per centimeter, number of major features per centimeter, and scaled edge length ratio), four of which were significantly different between the two groups and indicated greater lesion complexity in unstable compared with stable angina patients. No correlation was found between the parameters tested and the degree of luminal narrowing, showing the method's independence from traditional assessments of lesion severity. Excellent intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility was found for all of the parameters. This technique provides a more rigorous approach for analysis of lesion morphology than has previously been available, may provide a method for premorbid detection of high-risk lesions amenable to interventional therapy, and is especially well suited to detect subtle changes in lesion morphology after therapeutic interventions because the parameters are derived on a continuous scale and are not categorical.\r"

  ".U": "90322603\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with impaired ventricular function. Such patients have an appropriate substrate that is capable of generating rhythm abnormalities, which may be related to enhanced automaticity, triggered automaticity, and reentrant mechanisms; all three mechanisms are markedly potentiated by the action of catecholamines. Additionally, the sympathetic nervous system can provoke the development of hypokalemia and ischemia (which can independently lead to the occurrence of rhythm disturbances), and catecholamines may negate the beneficial electrophysiological actions of antiarrhythmic drugs. A substantial amount of experimental data implicates the sympathetic nervous system as a potent stimulus for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, especially in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Two important mechanisms that have been identified include 1) enhanced sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and 2) nonuniform myocardial denervation resulting in beta-receptor up-regulation and catecholamine hypersensitivity in the infarct zone. Disruption of sympathetic neural innervation of the heart and the use of beta-blocking agents may reduce the occurrence of sudden death and improve survival in animal models of arrhythmias and in some subsets of patients, including those with the long QT syndrome, a recent myocardial infarction, and perhaps those with a cardiomyopathy. The mechanism of this beneficial effect remains to be defined.\r"

  ".W": "beta-Adrenergic pathways in the human ventricular myocardium mediate the powerful positive inotropic effects of released neurotransmitters (norepinephrine) and circulating hormones (epinephrine) and the response to therapeutically administered beta-agonists. Two genetically and pharmacologically distinct receptors, beta 1 and beta 2, mediate the contractile effects of catecholamines in a similar manner. The biologic signal produced by the occupancy of beta-adrenergic receptors by catecholamine agonists is transduced, amplified, and regulated by a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which serve both stimulatory and inhibitory functions. Although the major biochemical effector of beta-adrenergic receptors is the enzyme protein--coupled directly to ion channels that regulate inotropic and electrophysiological effects. In human ventricular myocardium, heart failure produces changes in the beta-adrenergic receptor pathways that have the collective effect of reducing the degree of inotropic stimulation that may be produced by a given amount of beta-agonist. These changes include downregulation of beta 1-adrenergic receptors, uncoupling of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and an increase in the functional activity of the inhibitory G protein. These effects in turn are probably caused by exposure to increased amounts of neurotransmitter resulting from a complex series of changes in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system. Finally, the components of the beta-receptor-G protein system may be both acutely and chronically modulated by certain kinds of pharmacological therapy. These observations underscore the importance of the adrenergic nervous system in heart failure, and they create the potential for the development of new interventional strategies designed to alter the natural history of heart muscle disease and heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the clinical expression and, perhaps, to the course of myocardial failure. The failing heart exhibits both anatomic and functional defects in its sympathetic innervation and adrenergic receptor function. The nature of these abnormalities is at least partially dependent on the etiology of the underlying myocardial injury. Both efferent cardiac sympathetic tone and circulating catecholamines are elevated during the later stages of most forms of heart failure. This increase is not merely a reflex compensatory response but is also a reflection of defects in parasympathetic function, baroreceptor afferent nerve traffic, and regulation of sympathetic tone within the central nervous system through a serotonergic pathway. Prolonged stimulation of the heart may exhaust myocardial stores of norepinephrine and may lead to the destruction of sympathetic nerve terminals. Importantly, these abnormalities of autonomic function are distributed nonuniformly across the myocardium. Such heterogeneity can have profound effects on the temporal coordination of myocardial contraction and relaxation as well as the duration and configuration of the cardiac action potential and, thus, may contribute to both the mechanical and electrophysiological derangements seen in the failing heart. Therapy that makes sympathetic responses more uniform may improve the temporal coordination of excitation and contraction between innervated and denervated segments. This hypothesis might explain why both sympathetic agonists and antagonists may improve cardiac function since both types of drugs can restore the uniformity of neural stimulation.\r"

To address this issue, the inotropic, chronotropic, and lusitropic responses to BAR stimulation were studied in patients with CHF and in patients without cardiac disease. To evaluate inotropic responsiveness, dobutamine was infused directly into the left main coronary artery. The maximum inotropic response, as assessed by measurement of left ventricular +dP/dt, was markedly reduced in patients with CHF; however, the concentration-response curve for the effect of dobutamine was not shifted relative to that of normal subjects. The magnitude of the impairment in the inotropic response to intracoronary dobutamine was inversely related to resting plasma norepinephrine. Although there was no relation between resting plasma norepinephrine and any measure of hemodynamic function, the improvement in pump function that occurred with intracoronary dobutamine resulted in a rapid decrease in plasma norepinephrine. Preinfusion of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, milrinone, into the coronary artery resulted in a significant increase in the response to intracoronary dobutamine. To evaluate chronotropic responsiveness, the heart rate responses to a graded infusion of isoproterenol and during maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer were determined. The isoproterenol dose causing a 25 beat/min increase in heart rate (ISO25) was significantly higher in patients with CHF than in normal subjects. Likewise, the heart rate at peak exercise was significantly reduced in patients with CHF, despite similar levels of plasma norepinephrine at peak exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In particular, catecholamines may selectively improve diastolic function by reducing myofilament calcium sensitivity, accelerating sequestration of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and increasing the rate of actin-myosin cross-bridge turnover. These subcellular mechanisms, unique to inotropic agents that increase myocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate, result in an increased rate and extent of ventricular relaxation and diastolic filling and a decrease in cardiac filling pressures. Despite these potentially favorable biochemical and mechanical actions, a number of limitations and theoretical concerns remain to be addressed before catecholamine therapy is widely administered to patients with congestive heart failure and diastolic dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is activated in patients with heart failure. Hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities probably serve as the afferent stimulus for this response. This chronic activation is accompanied by an attenuation of reflex responsiveness to unloading of the central baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors. Loss of the buffering capacity of these afferent receptors may contribute to the sustained SNS stimulation. The renin-angiotensin system is uncoupled from the SNS, probably because the intrarenal mechanisms subserving renin release are preserved. Chronic activation of the SNS may contribute to disturbed hemodynamics as well as to long-term structural changes that may influence the natural history of the syndrome. A relation between plasma norepinephrine and mortality raises the possibility of a direct adverse effect of SNS activation on survival. Therapeutic approaches to inhibit the SNS include agents that block receptors, enhance the response to baroreceptor loading, inhibit presynaptic norepinephrine release, or act centrally to inhibit sympathetic outflow. The benefit-to-risk ratio for each of these possible interventions needs to be assessed in controlled long-term trials.\r"

  ".U": "90322610\r", 
  ".W": "The alpha-adrenergic component of the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and natural history of human congestive heart failure. While the augmentation of alpha-adrenergic tone (through the neuronal release of norepinephrine) is a valuable mechanism to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs in states of circulatory collapse, stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors produces detrimental hemodynamic effects in congestive heart failure. These undesirable effects result from alpha-mediated vasoconstriction and consist of excessive elevation of right and left ventricular filling pressures and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. The enhancement of alpha-adrenergic tone preferentially reduces blood flow to the hepatosplanchnic circulation. Many of the hemodynamic responses that are seen after activation of the renin-angiotensin system are related to the ability of angiotensin II to amplify the actions of the alpha-adrenergic system. Stimulation of myocardial alpha-adrenergic receptors in most species elicits a modest positive inotropic effect, but the presence and importance of this property in the human heart remains controversial. Chronic stimulation of myocardial alpha-adrenergic receptors may result in the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes and may also contribute to the development of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. Acute blockade of the heightened alpha-adrenergic tone in congestive heart failure (e.g., with first doses of prazosin) results in favorable hemodynamic effects, but repeated dosing leads to pharmacological tolerance. Consequently, the long-term administration of alpha-adrenergic blocking agents in human heart failure has not been accompanied by an improvement in clinical status, exercise capacity, or survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "beta-Adrenergic agonists and other agents that increase cellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) exert complex actions on myocardial cell function that enhance both the force of contraction and the rate of relaxation. At the same time that cyclic AMP increases the amount of activator Ca2+ released at the onset of systole, which increases contractility, this intracellular messenger accelerates the removal of activator Ca2+ from the cytosol by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which promotes relaxation. Cyclic AMP also increases Ca2+ sensitivity of the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pump and desensitizes contractile proteins to Ca2+, both of which favor relaxation. Thus, the lusitropic effects of cyclic AMP, which allow the heart to remove increased amounts of activator Ca2+ from the cytosol, occur simultaneously with cyclic AMP's inotropic effects. This interplay between inotropic and lusitropic effects allows beta-adrenergic agonists to increase myocardial contractility while accelerating relaxation, a combination of effects that allows the ventricles to fill during the agonist-induced tachycardia.\r"

  ".U": "90322612\r", 
  ".W": "Recently completed controlled clinical trials suggest that the functional status and natural history of patients with chronic heart failure can be modified by drugs that enhance or interfere with the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. Long-term treatment with beta-receptor agonists can produce clinical benefits in some patients by improving left ventricular diastolic function, even if tolerance develops to the effects of these drugs on cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. beta-Receptor stimulation, however, may also provoke ventricular arrhythmias by a direct effect on the failing heart or by promoting the development of hypokalemia. Similarly, long-term treatment with beta-receptor antagonists may improve left ventricular systolic performance, ameliorate symptoms, and reduce mortality in chronic heart failure. beta-Receptor blockade, however, may lead to worsening heart failure by interfering with the positive inotropic or the peripheral vasodilator actions of endogenous catecholamines. It is noteworthy that many of the benefits of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists seem to be mediated by the effects of these drugs on the beta 1-receptor, whereas many of the deleterious responses to treatment appear to be related to the interaction of these agents with the beta 2-receptor. These observations support the concept that beta 1-receptors are the principal mediators of cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in states of circulatory stress, are most likely to be altered by the abnormal pathophysiological conditions of chronic heart failure, and consequently, provide a rational target for the development of novel therapeutic agents.\r"

  ".W": "The existence of two dopamine receptor subtypes (DA1 and DA2) has been firmly established. Activation of DA1 receptors is associated with vasodilation, primarily in the renal, mesenteric, cerebral, and coronary arterial beds, and a natriuresis. DA2 receptors located on postganglionic sympathetic nerves and sympathetic ganglia mediate a decrease in the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals. The DA receptor activity of dopamine (which activates beta 1- and alpha-adrenoceptors as well as DA receptors) plays a prominent role in determining the beneficial hemodynamic responses to this drug in patients with heart failure. As a result, recent research efforts have been directed toward the development of dopamine analogues, which are orally effective and exhibit more selective agonist activity at DA receptors. Limited clinical experience in heart failure is now available for analogues with different spectra of receptor activity than dopamine, including selective DA1 and DA2 agonists. A review of these data is presented with an attempt to define the clinical relevance of the DA receptor-agonist properties of the compounds. Although the results of early clinical studies with some of these first-generation dopamine congeners are encouraging, analysis of ongoing large-scale placebo-controlled trials will provide valuable insight into their utility as therapeutic agents for patients with heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "It is well established that many drugs, such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics and the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin, are capable of inducing both nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. The factors that selectively predispose the kidney and inner ear to the toxic effects of these agents as well as the mechanism by which damage is produced are not well defined. The two organs differ greatly in their exposure to these toxic agents. The kidney has an abundant vascular supply and tends to selectively concentrate a number of drugs within the renal cortex or medulla, often to toxic levels. The vascular supply of the inner ear is not as extensive. In addition, the stria vascularis of the cochlea may act as a functional regulator of drug entry into inner ear fluids. The absorption of drugs into perilymph and endolymph is poorly understood. Selective accumulation theories of drug accumulation in the inner ear must be questioned because of the results of recent pharmacokinetic studies, which give contrary data. Drug-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity can be explained on a cellular level. Studies using radiolabeled gentamicin suggest that binding mechanisms of the drug to the plasma membrane of the outer hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular apparatus and to the brush border receptors of the renal proximal convoluted tubules are similar. This suggests the same receptor sites for aminoglycosides occur in otic and renal organs. Calcium channels are implicated because of the reversibility of aminoglycoside-induced changes in the cochlear microphonic by calcium and other divalent cations. Calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, reduce the nephrotoxicity of a number of drugs that are also ototoxic. Studies are needed to assess potential prevention of ototoxicity by use of these same calcium channel blocking agents. Aminoglycosides concentrate within the lysosomes of renal proximal tubular cells. Possibly, they also may concentrate in lysosomes within the cells of cochlear and vestibular structures. Nephrotoxic heavy metals concentrate within proximal tubular cells and, some, such as lead or bismuth, specifically concentrate within intracytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion bodies. Studies are necessary to determine if the same metals accumulate within the cochlear and vestibular cells, inclusion bodies, or both. These questions and others must be answered before it can be determined why many nephrotoxic drugs and agents are also ototoxic.\r"

No appreciation for the effect of urinary pH on excretion of methadone 2. Small number of patients enrolled with inadequate control subjects 3. The effect of smoking cigarettes was not evaluated or adequately controlled 4. Urine collections were often obtained without supervision and correcting results to creatinine excretion 5. Blood specimens were generally not collected from 0-15 minutes after intravenous dosing 6. Incomplete excretion data (nonhydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates) in the urine 7. Most studies did not evaluate protein binding of methadone when attempting to correlate therapeutic control or failure with serum concentrations of methadone. In general, the literature supporting the use of naltrexone was more favorable than for methadone, buprenorphine, LAAM, and clonidine. The major limitation on the use of naltrexone, however, is the lack of incentive for the patient to keep taking the medication. If the use of naltrexone, LAAM, buprenorphine, or clonidine becomes widely available, robust analytic techniques must be developed for monitoring of these drugs, their metabolites, or both in the urine to verify patient compliance.\r"

Lesions associated with significant risk of stroke include atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid bifurcation that compromise the lumen of the internal carotid artery by 75% or more, particularly if the plaque consists of soft material. A group of individuals with significant risk are those with atherosclerotic plaques containing large ulcerations. The risk of carotid endarterectomy is lower for patients with critical lesions that are asymptomatic than for patients with any other surgical indication, and averages a combined risk of morbidity and mortality of less than 1%. Two randomized, prospective studies are currently underway to compare the risks and the benefits of medical and of surgical management of this disease. Until the results of the randomized studies are available, prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for critical lesions is justified if the risk of surgery in the hands of an individual surgeon is less than 3% combined morbidity and mortality.\r"

Durational measures of the oral phase of swallowing were obtained on 34 patients with primary SS and 34 age-matched controls from analyses of ultrasound scans. Two conditions were examined: a basal (BA) swallow (only endogeneous secretions present in the subjects' mouths) and a 10 ml water bolus (WB) swallow. The patients with SS produced swallowing durations significantly longer (p less than 0.05) than those of the controls for each of the two conditions. Moreover, unlike normals, over 40% of the patients with SS produced WB swallows that were longer than their BA swallows. For further analyses, patients with SS were classified into two groups based on the difference in duration between their BA and WB swallows. These two groups differed from each other on clinical evaluations of oral motor function and presenting complaints. No significant differences were found between these two groups for salivary function or immunologic profile. These findings support the hypothesis that dysphagia can result from conditions leading to salivary gland dysfunction and document the need for the assessment of swallowing function in patients with Sjogren's syndrome.\r"

Four cerebral palsied children and three control children undertook a single sip-swallow of 5 ml of liquid and a solid mastication-swallow sequence on three occasions according to a defined protocol. The CP children exhibited much more variability and less control of the liquid bolus than did the controls. The ultrasound image clearly demonstrates the lack of control of the posterior of the tongue in many CP children. Some parts of the sequence of oral swallow and the time to achieve maximum anterior displacement of the hyoid bone appear to be slowed. The sequential events of swallowing show less variability as the sip-swallow proceeds from the oral voluntary to pharyngeal and lower involuntary phases. This study also identified a short-latency apnea that appears to accompany a saliva (protective) swallow and a long-latency apnea that accompanies semi-solid or liquid bolus (alimentary) swallows. Further investigations of normal and CP children utilizing a combined diagnostic imaging-physiological measurement approach will follow this initial study.\r"

Since dysfunction of these neurophysiological and neurochemical regulatory mechanisms in the NTS region may be important in pathophysiological conditions such as dysphagia, increased awareness of and focus on these mechanisms are warranted. This paper outlines recent neurophysiological and neurochemical data that provide information on the afferent inputs and neurophysiological properties of neurons in NTS and adjacent caudal brainstem regions implicated in swallowing, respiration, and respiratory-related reflexes.\r"

A new classification system has been proposed to deal with associated organ system failure and varying degrees of acute lung injury. ARDS is a permeability and inflammatory edema with damage and destruction at the air blood interface. Many cellular and humoral mediators probably attack the lung's surfactant system which in turn enhances edema formation. Supportive care with mechanical ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure results with the salvage of less than 50% of patients. Lung regeneration requires weeks or months to become complete in those who survive. Thus far no individual pharmacological agents have been shown to alter prognosis. Controlled clinical trials are required to evaluate new and older pharmacological agents alone or in combination, and surfactant replacement.\r"

An important component of this feedback axis is presumed to involve regulation of secretion and possibly synthesis of GnRH by the brain. We tested the hypothesis that the castration-induced increase in gonadotropin secretion is subserved, at least in part, by increased synthesis of GnRH. Using in situ hybridization and an oligonucleotide probe to pro-GnRH messenger RNA (GnRH mRNA), we compared the level of cellular GnRH mRNA and the relative number of GnRH mRNA-containing neurons between intact and 21-day castrate adult male rats. To derive estimates of the number of GnRH cells and the cellular GnRH mRNA content, coronal sections from each animal were anatomically matched between intact and castrate groups. All identifiable cells within these sections were counted and analyzed with the aid of a computerized image analysis system, by an observer unaware of the animal's experimental group and were assigned an anatomical location for reference. In an initial experiment, we observed no difference in cellular GnRH mRNA signal level between intact (n = 4) and castrate (n = 5) animals (129 +/- 8 vs. 139 +/- 5 grains per cell); however, we did find a statistical difference between the intact and castrated groups in the relative number of GnRH mRNA-containing cells (intact: 212 +/- 15 vs. castrate: 320 +/- 18). To confirm this observation, we repeated the experiment by again comparing the number of GnRH mRNA-positive cells between intact (n = 4) and castrate (n = 4) rats. In this second experiment, we found no difference in the number of identifiable GnRH mRNA-containing cells between intact and castrate animals (272 +/- 14 vs. 274 +/- 36, respectively); this was the case for the total cell count as well as when the data were analyzed by anatomical region. To clarify the conflicting results on cell counts of Exps 1 and 2, we repeated the experiment a third time, again comparing both the number of GnRH mRNA-containing cells and the cellular content of GnRH mRNA. In this experiment, we observed that neither cell number nor content of GnRH mRNA differed between the intact and castrate groups. Again, this was the case for total cell count, as well as when the data were analyzed by anatomical region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Endothelin (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide with potent vasopressor and vasoconstrictive properties. Specific, high affinity receptors for ET-1 have been found in the adrenal gland. The stimulation by ET-1 of aldosterone secretion in cultured calf zona glomerulosa cells was shown to depend on the serum used for culturing and was not related to the growth-promoting effects of serum or the response to another secretagogue, such as angiotensin-II. In this study, binding of [125I]ET-1 to crude membrane preparations from calf adrenal cortex slices showed that ET-1 binding was greater in the outer slices, corresponding to the zona glomerulosa, than in inner slices, corresponding to the zona fasciculata. ET-1 stimulated aldosterone, but not cortisol, biosynthesis. Adrenal zona glomerulosa preincubated with ET-1 resulted in homologous down-regulation. Since ET-1 action involves activation of protein kinase-C (PKC), we studied the effect of a phorbol ester (PMA) on the down-regulation of ET-1 receptors. PMA decreased the number of cell surface receptors, and its effect was prevented by pretreatment with the PKC inhibitors H-7 and sphyngosine. Agonist-mediated down-regulation could not be blocked by pretreatment with PKC inhibitors, suggesting that PKC is involved in phorbol ester-mediated, but not agonist-mediated down-regulation of ET-1 receptors. Both effectors increased the endocytosis rate constant as well as the steady state cytosolic membrane-bound ratio for ET-1 receptors, suggesting that the decrease in the number of cell surface receptors is at least partially due to an increased internalization of the hormone-receptor complex. ET-1 and PMA decreased the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into calf zona glomerulosa cell cultures. We conclude that ET-1 and PMA have similar effects on glomerulosa cells, producing down-regulation of ET-1 receptors and an antimitogenic effect, but these actions are through different mechanisms.\r"

In the present study, we evaluate the role of LHRH in modulating nociceptive responses in female rats. In ovariectomized (OVX) rats, an LHRH agonist ([ Des-Gly10] LHRH ethyl amide; 1 ng/rat/microliters), given intraventricularly (icv) at either 90, 60, or 30 min before a hot-plate test caused a time-dependent, significant increase in sensitivity to the noxious thermal stimulus (hyperalgesia) vs. saline-treated controls. Further, the LHRH agonist (1 ng/rat/microliters; icv) attenuated morphine (5 mg/kg, sc)-induced antinociception. The injection of an LHRH antagonist, [D-Phe2,Pro3,D-Phe6] LHRH, to OVX rats in doses of 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/rat 30 min prior to morphine, enhanced and prolonged morphine-induced antinociception in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the hyperalgesia observed in OVX rats treated with naloxone (1 mg/kg, sc) was reversed by preinjection of either the LHRH antagonist (0.1 ng/rat, icv) or LHRH antiserum. OVX rats primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) and progesterone (P) were less sensitive to the antinociceptive effect of morphine than OVX rats. When EBP-treated rats received the LHRH antagonist prior to morphine, a twofold increase in morphine-induced antinociception was observed. A similar effect was observed in EBP-treated rats after the injection of LHRH antiserum. In conclusion, LHRH may interact with central opioid systems causing an increased sensitivity to nociceptive stimulation (hyperalgesia) and reduction of the antinociceptive effect of morphine.\r"

One of these (anti-LHR02) was directed against a 13 amino acid sequence that occurs within the large N-terminal hydrophilic domain, and another (anti-LHR06) was directed against the 14 most C-terminal amino acids of the receptor (as deduced from the open reading frame of the cDNA). These antisera, which we show to be highly specific for the LH/CG receptor, were used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments with primary cultures of rat luteal cells to determine the orientation of this receptor within the plasma membrane. Anti-LHR02 was shown to specifically bind to intact cells. In contrast, anti-LHR06 did not bind to intact cells. When the cells were first permeabilized with detergent and then incubated with this antibody, however, an intense and specific immunofluorescence was observed. These studies clearly show that the orientation of the LH/CG receptor in the plasma membrane is such that the N-terminal domain is located extracellularly, while the C terminus is located intracellularly. Thus, we have experimentally confirmed that the orientation of this receptor as predicted from the amino acid sequence is indeed correct.\r"

  ".W": "The hormonal regulation of GH receptors was studied by measuring specific binding of [125I]human GH to primary cultured rat hepatocytes. The binding of labeled GH to primary cultured hepatocytes decreased during culture, but addition of dexamethasone (100 nM) compensated for this decrease and even increased GH binding. After addition of dexamethasone, the binding increased to a maximum after 10 h, and after 24 h was about 6 times that of control cells. Glucagon (100 nM) did not have any significant effect on GH binding by itself, but enhanced the increased binding caused by dexamethasone about 1.5-fold. For this effect, glucagon could be replaced by (Bu)2cAMP. Insulin (10 nM) and epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml) reduced the increase by dexamethasone plus glucagon by about half. Scatchard plot analysis showed that the changes of GH binding induced by various hormones were due to changes in the number of binding sites without significant changes in their affinity. The GH bound to dexamethasone or dexamethasone plus glucagon-treated cells was not replaced by unlabeled ovine PRL. This strongly suggests that the number of somatogenic (GH) receptors may be subject to hormonal regulation: dexamethasone alone or with glucagon may induce GH receptors, whereas insulin and EGF may suppress the induction of GH receptors. These patterns of hormonal regulations were almost the same as those of proteins whose expressions were known to be differentiated functions of liver. On the other hand, the increase of GH binding by dexamethasone was inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, though the GH binding was inhibited by cycloheximide, but not by actinomycin D in the cells cultured without dexamethasone. This result suggests that the increased binding induced by dexamethasone is dependent on the synthesis of new protein and is probably regulated at a pretranslational level.\r"

  ".W": "N-methyl-D,L,-aspartate (NMA), an analog of the excitatory neurotransmitter aspartate, has been previously shown to acutely stimulate LH release in the rodent and primate. In this study, we examine the effect of NMA on LH secretion in the long term ovariectomized adult rhesus monkey. After a 3-h control period, three successive iv bolus injections of NMA (10 or 45 mg) were administered at hourly intervals, and LH and cortisol responses were compared with those after iv administration of physiological saline. LH concentrations remained unchanged throughout the saline infusion (n = 6) and during the 10-mg NMA injection regimen (n = 5). Unexpectedly, LH decreased during NMA injections at a dose of 45 mg (n = 10): areas under the LH curve, expressed as percentage of baseline control, were: hour 1, -16.0% (+/- 2.7 SE); hour 2, -28.4 (+/- 3.2 SE); hour 3; -30.9 (+/- 3.2 SE), P less than 0.005 vs. saline or 10 mg NMA. This inhibitory effect of NMA was prevented by the coadministration of GnRH (3 micrograms) (n = 5), suggesting that NMA acts at a suprapituitary level. Cortisol secretion was significantly increased by 45 mg of NMA; Total areas under the cortisol curve, expressed as percentage of baseline control, were: saline, -24.2% (+/- 4.2 SE); NMA (10 mg), -24.2 (+/- 2.0); NMA (45 mg), +22.2 (+/- 6.2); P less than 0.001 vs. NMA (10 mg) and saline, suggesting that NMA at the higher dose may activate the adrenal axis. To examine a possible role of the adrenal axis on NMA-induced LH inhibition, we next examined the effects of intraventricular administration of antiserum to CRF. Pretreatment with CRF antiserum prevented the decrease in LH levels seen during NMA (45 mg) in 4 of 8 monkeys (hour 2, -8.5% (+/- 6.5); hour 3, -10.3% (+/- 4.3); P less than 0.01 vs. NMA). The NMA-induced cortisol increase was prevented in the antiserum responsive but not in the nonresponsive animals. A similar preventive action on LH was seen after administration of the endogenous opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (2 or 5 mg/h), most notably in caged animals (n = 4: hour 1, 6.2% (+/- 3.8); hour 2, -2.8 (+/- 4.0); hour 3, -9.9 (+/- 5.0); P less than 0.005 vs. NMA, 45 mg, for hour 1 and hour 2). We conclude that the unexpected inhibitory effects of NMA on LH secretion in the adult ovariectomized monkey are the result of the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by NMA and specifically of the release of CRF and endogenous opioid peptides.\r"
