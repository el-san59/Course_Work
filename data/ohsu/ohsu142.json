  ".W": "To determine the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on development of tolerance and fluid retention in patients with chronic congestive heart failure during long-term prazosin treatment, plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, norepinephrine and maximal exercise tolerance were measured during chronic therapy with digitalis and diuretics, to which prazosin, captopril or a combination of both drugs was added. Plasma renin concentration and aldosterone level decreased slightly during prazosin therapy and norepinephrine level increased significantly. When captopril was given, plasma renin concentration increased as expected, aldosterone level normalized and norepinephrine level decreased significantly. When prazosin was added to captopril therapy, norepinephrine level increased and plasma renin concentration and aldosterone level did not change. Exercise capacity did not increase during prazosin treatment, but was increased with captopril treatment. Prazosin treatment was associated with an increase in body weight even though the dose of furosemide was increased. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system did not prevent fluid retention induced by prazosin during combination therapy. These findings suggest that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is not substantially involved in development of tolerance and fluid retention during prazosin therapy; stimulation of plasma norepinephrine may be of decisive importance.\r"

  ".W": "Dried beans, because of their high-fiber content and low-glycemic index, are especially suitable for diabetic diets. Most South African bean recipes contain sucrose, and since a restriction of artificial sweeteners seems desirable, replacing sucrose would be impractical. Hence, we examined the effects of 10, 20, and 30% sucrose additions to cooked dried butter beans on taste preference and acceptability in 29 diabetic patients and 11 control subjects. The effect of sucrose additions on glycemic index and insulin response to butter beans was determined in control subjects. Both diabetic and control subjects preferred beans with sucrose additions (p less than 0.005). Additions of sucrose up to 20% of total carbohydrate had no adverse effects on glycemic index or insulin response of butter beans (p less than 0.05), which indicates that addition of moderate amounts of sucrose to a low glycemic index food may improve palatability without impairing the favorable effect on blood glucose and insulin response.\r"

At 2-wk intervals, healthy volunteers consumed drinks containing glucose, starch, glucose followed 20 min later by fructose, starch followed 20 min later by fructose, and water followed 20 min later by fructose. Fructose consumption following glucose or starch drinks produced significantly higher levels of plasma insulin, but not plasma glucose, as compared to corresponding drinks consumed without fructose. Ten subjects whose blood glucose response levels were above 155 mg% after a glucose-containing drink appeared to be particularly responsive to the effects of fructose with increases in insulin levels of 60-288%. Results indicate that oral fructose can be insulinogenic in humans when blood glucose levels are elevated.\r"

Six starch-rich foods were tested alone and in an isoglucido-lipido-protidic meal in 18 NIDDs and compared with a glucose challenge. These test meals were randomly assigned using a three factor experiment design. All three tests contained 50 g carbohydrate; mixed meals were adjusted to bring the same amount of fat (20 g), protein (24 g), water (300 mL), and calories (475 kcal) but not the same amount of fiber. Whatever the tested meals, foods elicited a growing glycemic index hierarchy from beans to lentils, rice, spaghetti, potato, and bread (mean range: 0.21 +/- 0.12-92 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.001). Mixing the meals significantly increased the insulinemic indexes (p less than 0.05) and introduced a positive correlation between glycemic and insulinemic indexes (n = 6, r = 0.903; p less than 0.05). The glycemic index concept remains discriminating, even in the context of an iso-glucido-lipido-protidic meal. Insulinemic indexes do not improve discrimination between foods taken alone in type 2 diabetics: they only discriminate between foods during mixed meals, similarly to glycemic indexes.\r"

Postprandial concentrations of plasma insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin were measured to explore the mechanism of action. The effect on plasma triglyceride levels was also studied. Supplementation of soy polysaccharide significantly enhanced return of serum glucose levels towards fasting level during the latter half of the meal test. Addition of soy polysaccharide had no effect on plasma insulin levels but appeared (p greater than 0.05) to lessen postprandial increases in glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide levels while it raised somatostatin levels. Soy polysaccharide significantly reduced the rise of postprandial plasma triglyceride levels. The changes in plasma glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin levels may have been instrumental in the observed postprandial glucose and triglyceride effects.\r"

All cases were nonreactive for leukocyte common antigen, myoglobin, and Factor VIII-related antigen. These results point to the fact that epithelioid sarcoma expresses phenotypic characteristics more often associated with epithelioid neoplasms, rather than the mesenchymal profile of most soft tissue sarcomas. One explanation for this observation is that epithelioid sarcoma is in fact a carcinoma originating in the deep soft tissues. On the other hand, the pluripotential mesoderm has a known embryonic capacity to differentiate into epithelium and, therefore, it is plausible that epithelioid sarcoma is a mesenchymally derived neoplasm. Aside from histogenetic considerations, epithelioid sarcoma may be confused with a number of other neoplastic and granulomatous processes. Differential immunohistochemical stains are useful in selected instances wherein light and electron microscopic findings are diagnostically equivocal.\r"

Adrenocorticotrophic hormone was immunohistochemically localized in two bronchial and one pancreatic tumor, which contained CRH-like immunoreactivity. No CRH was detected in nontumorous extrahypothalamic tissues from which the CRH-containing tumors derived, two mediastinal endocrine carcinomas, six endocrine tumors of the stomach/duodenum/appendix, eight pheochromocytomas, one Merkel cell tumor, and 32 squamous and adenocarcinomas of the lung/gut. CRH-like immunoreactivity may be found in tumors composed of peptide-hormone-producing endocrine cells; hypersecretion of CRH by those neoplasms may be significant in the development of Cushing's syndrome.\r"

In cases where Isolator recovered organisms first, the average difference in time was one to two days. Regarding particular groups of organisms, there was no difference between the systems in recovery of Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, yeast, and gram-positive bacteria, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Septi-Chek recovered S. pneumoniae significantly more often. These results suggest that these two systems are essentially comparable, except with S. pneumoniae, although the Isolator frequently provided results more rapidly.\r"

In adenomas and carcinomas, crystals were decreased except for three cases with a striking focal increase. None was found in 22 adult primate thyroids. After Clorox digestion of human thyroids, calcium oxalate dihydrate was identified by x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. Origin, tissue and species localization are discussed in relation to ascorbate metabolism, thyroperoxidase, and calcitonin. Possible metabolic roles are suggested. Calcium oxalate crystals injected in animals and humans initiate a foreign body reaction with giant cells. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, crystals disappear but occasionally remain with giant cell reaction. In subacute thyroiditis, granulomas are related more to colloid than to crystals.\r"

The hyaline bodies found in the first six diseases displayed intense immunoreactivity for the basement membrane components, type IV collagen, and laminin, whereas the hyaline bodies occurring in the latter three diseases were unreactive. These findings suggest that a common histogenesis of the extracellular hyaline body is the stimulatory effect of an altered growth state (hyperplasia, neoplasia, or endocrinopathy) on basement membrane synthesis in cells that normally produce a basement membrane.\r"

The four control cases selected for a trace of staining of the nuclei of C. luciliae gave negative reactions with the kinetoplasts. The titer for each individual positive serum varied from 1.36 to 2.67 (mean SG 2.04) geometric standard deviation units. The staining pattern of sera positive for anti-nDNA antibodies on C. luciliae included reactivity of the kinetoplast with or without nuclear staining. The drug-induced LE serum produced only nuclear staining with no significant kinetoplast staining, i.e., a negative test for anti-nDNA antibodies. Patient control sera stained only the nucleus when any reactivity on C. luciliae was present. Generally, there were no major differences in titers and patterns of sera when comparisons were made between manufacturers. The sera were also tested by the Farr radioimmunoassay and the latex nucleoprotein test. The results of both of these assays correlated in most cases with the C. luciliae reactions.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the feasibility of immunotyping specimens transported over great distance, the University of Arizona and the Cleveland Clinic exchanged 39 lymphoma cases (26 B-cell, 13 T-cell cases) via air express for phenotyping. They were exchanged with the use of glass slides with adherent snap-frozen sections. The method involved immunohistochemistry using a common battery of 20 antibodies directed at B- and T-cell antigens. Using similar, but not identical, methods and reagents, cases were assayed before and after transport. Results were generated as paired determinations in a double-blind fashion (1,338 total determinations, 669 paired determinations/669 antigens). Using \"pretransport\" values as the baseline, there was subsequent agreement with baseline in 624 of 669 antigenic determinations (93.3%) and disagreement in 45 (6.7%). Interinstitutional agreement was 94% for T-antigens (Leu-1-7,9) and 93% for B-antigens (K, lambda; IgM, G, A, D; B1, B2, B4, L14; J5, common acute lymphocyte leukemia antigen [CALLA]; Ia). In spite of 6.7% disagreement, there was agreement of overall phenotypic profile (e.g., B vs. T and subset stage) in all 39 cases. This is because discrepancies were isolated and the battery offset undue reliance on a single antigen. The disagreements relate mainly to certain B-antigens: CALLA/J5 (eight disagreements) and B1 and B2 (six and five disagreements, respectively). T-antigen disagreements were more sporadic (e.g., Leu-5 [three disagreements]). These discrepancies may relate to antigen loss with transport, variable antigen density or antibody avidity, methodologic differences, quality of reagents, or differences of phenotype interpretation. A further exchange of the 45 disagreement slides indicated that difference of observer interpretation was a minor factor (3 of 45). In conclusion, the authors' study demonstrates a high degree of immunotype reproducibility (approximately 93%), suggesting promise for institutions doing collaborative lymphoma studies.\r"

Sputum Gram's stain and culture results suggesting significant infection with beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. catarrhalis were correlated with a retrospective chart review of eight pediatric and ten adult patients. Preexisting pulmonary disease was observed in 12 patients; 5 had a history of aspiration; and 13 were intubated. Clinically, ten patients had pneumonia, five had bronchitis, and three manifested no disease. Only three sputum specimens grew a pure culture of B. catarrhalis, and six specimens yielded B. catarrhalis in the presence of normal upper respiratory flora. Analysis of broth microdilution susceptibility test results showed that 90% of the strains were inhibited at the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs90): ampicillin, 8 micrograms/mL; cefotaxime, 0.5 microgram/mL; cefoxitin, 0.5 microgram/mL; cephalexin, 4 micrograms/mL; cephalothin, 8 micrograms/mL; chloramphenicol, 1 microgram/mL; clindamycin, 4 micrograms/mL; erythromycin, 0.25 microgram/mL; methicillin, 16 micrograms/mL; mezlocillin, 16 micrograms/mL; moxalactam less than or equal to 0.6 microgram/mL; penicillin, 16 micrograms/mL; piperacillin, 8 micrograms/mL; tetracycline, less than or equal to 0.3 microgram/mL; and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 1.6/30 micrograms/mL. Therapy may have been adequate in only eight (44%) of the cases. However, all but four of the patients, who died of unrelated causes, exhibited resolution of disease. The data indicate that Gram's stain and culture results of sputum specimens suggesting B. catarrhalis bronchopulmonary infection should be interpreted with caution by clinicians.\r"

The predictive value positive for the latex test was 90%, and the accuracy was 98%. The sensitivity of the latex test for detection of specimens having ten or more colonies of Group A streptococci was 95%. Non-Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 65 specimens, and all of these specimens had negative latex tests.

Campylobacter pyloridis produces large amounts of urease, and the presence of this enzyme in gastric mucosa usually indicates infection with the organism. In this paper we describe the use of a rapid urease test (CLOtest) to detect C. pyloridis infection in gastric mucosal biopsies. In 141 consecutive endoscopy cases, antral biopsies were taken for culture and histology, and an extra biopsy was inserted into the CLOtest gel. There were 79 patients infected with C. pyloridis, 78 of whom were detected by CLOtest: 75% were positive at 20 min, 92% at 3 h, and 98% at 24 h. There were no false positive results. Eighteen infected patients were rebiopsied after a course of amoxycillin and bismuth subcitrate. Active chronic gastritis resolved in eight of nine who were cleared of the organism, but histological gastritis was unchanged in nine patients who were still infected. CLOtest is a simple, sensitive, and highly specific test that enables the endoscopist to diagnose C. pyloridis infection in the endoscopy room. A negative test after antibiotic therapy correlates with clearance of the bacteria and healing of active gastritis.\r"

  ".W": "To see whether foods with slower rates of digestion may benefit the metabolic abnormalities seen in cirrhosis, the same food, processed in two different ways, was fed to seven patients with cirrhosis. The breakfast of lentils processed by prolonged heating, to produce more rapid in vitro digestion, resulted in a significantly higher incremental rise in large neutral amino acid levels at 60 min (p less than 0.02) and a tendency for a more rapid rise in total amino acid concentrations by comparison with conventionally cooked lentils with slower in vitro digestion rates. After more rapidly digested lentils, incremental levels of branched-chain amino acids were also higher at 60 min (67 +/- 9, p less than 0.001) despite a greater overall insulin response. Comparable incremental amino acid areas after both meals suggested that the total amount of amino acids absorbed was not influenced by processing. Greater blood glucose, insulin, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide responses were seen after the more processed meal with no significant differences in pancreatic glucagon, entroglucagon, or neurotensin levels. Processing a food to alter the rate of digestion may therefore be used to manipulate amino acid, glucose, and endocrine responses in cirrhosis.\r"

Comparative studies were conducted using polyclonal antibodies to human C3, C5, IgG, IgA, and IgM. In normal human tissue, there was a close correlation between increasing chronologic age and the quantity of MAC deposited in the mesangial stalk, along the interstitial aspect of and within tubular basement membranes (TBMs) and in arteriolar walls. IF of kidney tissues from 12 patients with IDDM with varying degrees of mesangial expansion and glomerulosclerosis demonstrated a direct relationship between the degree of tissue damage and the amount of MAC deposited in the mesangium. IEM of three normal and four diabetic specimens revealed reaction product of Poly C9-MA on linear and circular membranous structures within the mesangium, TBMs, and vessel walls, and within the glomerular basement membranes (GBMs) in diabetic subjects. Evidence is presented that these structures, which have been previously described by routine electron microscopy, represent cellular debris in these loci on which Poly C9-MA has been deposited. In MPGN II, Poly C9-MA and C3 were distributed within subepithelial deposits, along either side of the dense deposits (DDs) within the GBMs and TBMs, and around circular masses of DDs within the mesangium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since the introduction of sophisticated immunologic staining methods, glomerular morphologic abnormalities have been noted in more than 50% of patients with cirrhosis at both necropsy and biopsy. The distinctive pathologic findings consist of glomerular mesangial IgA deposits usually accompanied by complement deposition. Increased serum IgA levels are found in over 90% of cirrhotic patients with glomerular IgA deposition. Cirrhotic glomerulonephritis is usually a clinically silent disease, however, the diagnosis can be suspected by finding proteinuria or abnormalities of the urine sediment. The pathogenesis may relate to defective hepatic processing and/or portacaval shunting of circulating immune complexes.\r"

The Cox regression model for multifactorial analysis confirms the significantly lower graft survival for the mixed racial combination group with a relative risk of 1.27 (P less than .05). By this analysis, other significant factors adversely affecting the graft survival rates include diabetes as a cause of end-stage renal disease, earlier date of transplantation, shorter duration of prior dialysis, and a significant center effect. Patient survival has a significantly greater relative risk for the black to white racial combination, diabetes, earlier calendar year of transplantation, and age of patient. While the mixed racial group was slightly older (delta = 2 years), had more hypertension, less glomerulonephritis, and more HLA mismatches, our analysis by the Cox regression model suggests that these factors played only minor roles (P greater than .05) regarding graft survival rates. Therefore, our data suggest that independent of several other factors, cadaver kidneys have a better functional outcome when they are transplanted into recipients of the same race.\r"

Untreated, such metastases can produce the symptoms that most concern cancer patients--pain, pathologic fractures, and paralysis through epidural cord compression. Recent advances in the understanding of the metastatic cascade and the regulation of bone formation and resorption provide unique therapeutic approaches for prevention and treatment of these lesions. This article reviews the prevalence, distribution, diagnosis, and treatment of metastatic cancer in the skeleton, as well as the processes involved in the development of such metastases, the local mediators responsible for some of the destructive changes in bone, and their pathologic results. In addition to considering some of the conventional therapeutic approaches, a rationale for the use of bone resorption inhibitors, such as the diphosphonates (bisphosphonates), is presented for the prevention and amelioration of the pathologic consequences of skeletal metastases.\r"

Measurements of active plasma renin and inactive plasma renin were made in normal subjects, patients with acute pancreatitis, and patients with acute abdominal pain syndromes exclusive of pancreatitis. Active plasma renin values were significantly increased in acute pancreatitis, nearly 500 percent higher than in the other two groups. Inactive plasma renin values were similar in the three groups. In a subgroup of patients with acute pancreatitis, measurements were made on presentation and after recovery. The elevated active plasma renin values on admission fell significantly with recovery, in parallel with changes in serum amylase values. Inactive plasma renin values changed variably; there was a significant inverse regression relationship between the changes in active and inactive plasma renin values with recovery. The results indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is activated in acute pancreatitis to a significantly greater extent than in other syndromes with acute abdominal pain. The increased active plasma renin in acute pancreatitis is most likely due to renal release secondary to the reduced circulating volume and hypotensive effect of this disease. However, changes in the relationship between active and inactive plasma renin in some patients suggest that activation of inactive renin by proteolytic enzymes released in acute pancreatitis might play an additional role.\r"

The mean serum glucose level fell more rapidly in both groups receiving \"rapid\" regimens, reaching less than 200 mg/dl in 3.0 days with the \"rapid\" regimen compared with 5.9 days with the \"standard\" regimen (p less than 0.005). Duration of hospitalization was similarly reduced (6.4 versus 9.9 days, p less than 0.0001) as was the cost of hospitalization. In contrast to the \"rapid\" regimens, symptomatic hypoglycemia was common and adequate glycemic control was rare with the \"standard\" regimen. Thus, rapid initiation of insulin therapy with 0.5 to 0.6 units/kg per day of a mixture of regular and intermediate-acting insulins given twice daily is effective, safe, and reduces the cost of hospitalization in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who require insulin treatment.\r"

They were then given 750 ml of stored plasma, 750 ml of fresh frozen plasma, and then an infusion of angiotensin II, in random order on successive days. Infusion of fresh frozen plasma improved function more than did stored plasma and in addition returned a very low filtration fraction toward normal. Angiotensin II infusion increased filtration fraction, but decreased glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and urine flow sharply. Patients were then given a daily infusion of 1,000 ml of fresh frozen plasma for seven to 18 days to expand the blood volume to supranormal levels as assayed by serial measurement of blood volume. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased to a normal range, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow both increased, and urinary excretion of sodium and potassium both returned toward normal. The effect of intraperitoneal pressure was then studied by measuring glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, pressure in the vena cava, hepatic vein free flow, and hepatic vein wedged pressure before, during, and after paracentesis to reduce the intraperitoneal pressure from 30 to 40 cm H2O to 12 to 17 cm H2O. Venous pressures moved parallel to ascitic fluid pressures, and glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and urine flow all improved sharply; then, as ascitic fluid continued to form, reducing vascular volume, urine flow, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow all decreased slowly. Six patients then underwent placement of a LeVeen shunt. Improvement in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and clinical condition was dramatic. During postoperative observation of up to two years, progressive improvement in hepatic function has occurred.\r"

If not promptly recognized, pseudoachalasia can result in inappropriate pneumatic dilatation of the lower esophageal sphincter segment and delay appropriate treatment of the underlying malignancy. During the past 14 years, six patients with pseudoachalasia and 161 patients with primary idiopathic achalasia were encountered. Pseudoachalasia occurred mainly in the elderly and represented about 9 percent of these patients over 60 years of age with suspected achalasia. Five of the six pseudoachalasia cases were secondary to adenocarcinoma that originated in the gastric fundus, and one was caused by a squamous cell carcinoma of the distal esophagus. Conventional esophageal manometry did not discriminate achalasia from pseudoachalasia. On the other hand, esophagogastroscopy with biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of pseudoachalasia in five of these cases and in 24 of 32 cases reported previously. Ominous endoscopic findings are mucosal ulceration or nodularity, reduced compliance of the esophagogastric junction, or an inability to pass the endoscope into the stomach. Radiographic evaluation, particularly in conjunction with amyl nitrite inhalation, was also useful in discriminating pseudoachalasia from primary achalasia. It is concluded that pseudoachalasia generally mimics idiopathic achalasia imperfectly and can usually be diagnosed prior to surgery by fastidious endoscopic and radiographic examination.\r"

Eighteen consecutive patients with disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma were then randomly assigned to therapy with either recombinant alpha interferon or ABV/ADV.

  ".W": "Randomized clinical trials have become the accepted scientific standard for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. Contradictory results from multiple randomized clinical trials on the same topic have been attributed either to methodologic deficiencies in the design of one of the trials or to small sample sizes that did not provide assurance that a meaningful therapeutic difference would be detected. When 36 topics with conflicting results that included over 200 randomized clinical trials in cardiology and gastroenterology were reviewed, it was discovered that results of randomized clinical trials often disagree because the complexity of the randomized clinical trial design and the clinical setting creates inconsistencies and variation in the therapeutic evaluation. Nine methodologic sources of this variation were identified, including six items concerned with the design of the trials, and three items concerned with interpretation. The design issues include eligibility criteria and the selection of study groups, baseline differences in the available population, variability in indications for the principal and concomitant therapies, protocol requirements of the randomized clinical trial, and management of intermediate outcomes. The issues in interpreting the trials include the regulatory effects of treatments, the frailty of double-blinding, and the occurrence of unexpected trial outcomes. The results of this review suggest that pooled analyses of conflicting results of randomized clinical trials (meta-analyses) may be misleading by obscuring important distinctions among trials, and that enhanced flexibility in strategies for data analysis will be needed to ensure the clinical applicability of randomized clinical trial results.\r"

Mean foot length at each week of gestation compared favorably with Streeter's data, based on pathologic specimens, described in 1920. Comparison of curvilinear regression of foot length versus gestational age demonstrated a strong correlation with an R2 value of 0.981; 95% confidence intervals at each week compared favorably with both biparietal diameter and femur length data. Fetal foot length is a reliable parameter for use in the assessment of gestational age and is particularly useful when other parameters do not accurately predict gestational age, for example, hydrocephalus, anencephaly, short limb dysplasia.\r"

In the four cases without prenatal diagnosis, two infants were delivered vaginally, and two were delivered abdominally for obstetric reasons. There was one case of neonatal morbidity where tumor vascularity and rupture resulted in hypovolemic shock. All tumors were resected and found to be benign. A plan of management is recommended and, with appropriate obstetric and pediatric care, a good outcome can be anticipated in most cases.\r"

Gestational age and birth weight were similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. There was a strong correlation between total white blood cell count and both mature and immature neutrophil counts in survivors but this correlation decreased substantially in neonates that died. Analysis of variance indicated that the means for polymorphonuclear leukocyte and immature neutrophil counts were significantly higher in survivors. Nosocomial sepsis (38 cases) occurred in premature low birth weight infants receiving invasive, intensive care. The most common organism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (76%). Total white blood cell, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, and immature neutrophil counts rose significantly in response to sepsis. None died. Prevention of congenital sepsis requires methods to detect early maternal-fetal infection. Providing granulocytes to neutropenic neonates with congenital sepsis might improve outcome.\r"

Several formulas for weight estimation based on sonographic measurements are in common use, but none of them has been devised specifically for the infant of a diabetic mother. We assessed the accuracy of conventional formulas at estimating fetal weight in 160 of these infants and found their relative errors (error as a percentage of birth weight) had standard deviations of 12.2% to 13.1% (greater than has been reported in the general population) with no statistically significant difference among formulas. We also devised customized formulas generated from a \"training set\" of 80 patients and tested on a second set of 80 patients. The best formula yielded a standard deviation of 11.0%. The difference between customized and conventional formulas was not statistically significant. With use of one conventional formula, the likelihood of macrosomia was found to be 77% when the estimated weight was greater than 4000 gm and 86% when the estimated weight was greater than 4500 gm. We conclude that fetal weight prediction is even less accurate in the infant of a diabetic mother than in the general population and that \"customized\" formulas fare no better than conventional formulas in diabetics. Despite this, estimated weights can offer guidance in predicting fetal macrosomia and therefore aid in obstetric management.\r"

Gram stain was performed and read immediately on admission. Cultures were also obtained simultaneously and sent for microbiologic evaluation. All women with Gram stains positive for gram-positive cocci were treated with intravenous ampicillin in the event of labor, unless vaginal culture results were already known and were negative for group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus. A total of 72 women had samples taken, and 30 (41.7%) were positive for gram-positive cocci. Nine (30%) of these were subsequently positive for group B beta-hemolytic streptococci by culture. There were no cultures positive for group B beta-hemolytic streptococci in the Gram stain-negative group. Gram stain sensitivity was 100% for predicting the presence of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci in the study population, and specificity was 66.7%. Selective vaginal Gram stain provides an effective and rapid screen for identifying the presence of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci and allows for immediate institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy in the event of onset of labor before the availability of culture results.\r"

If such women were to opt for that procedure, about 20% of all cases of Down syndrome could be detected. It is now possible to identify an additional 20% of all Down syndrome pregnancies in women under age 35, with the use of a screening process that combines a woman's maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level and her age. We present a method whereby a woman's individual odds for Down syndrome can be calculated by combining the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measurement with her age, on the basis of published age-related Down syndrome risk data and on maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein distributions for unaffected and Down syndrome pregnancies. These individual odds calculations provide the basis both for establishing maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein/Down syndrome screening cutoffs and for counseling.\r"

These infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. Often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. With treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent; however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. Bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Among the aerobic gram-positive organisms, several varieties of streptococci such as Group B streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. Staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen. Among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is Escherichia coli. Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. Species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. Among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are Peptostreptococci and Peptococci. Clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. Among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the Bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens. Bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. Other organisms encountered are Chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.\r"

Many improvements in antimicrobial agents are based on a knowledge of the mechanism responsible for resistance. This has led to the development of new extended-spectrum antibiotic compounds. However, several features have been noted since the development of extended-spectrum antibiotics, such as the rapid development of bacterial resistance, the induction of beta-lactamase enzyme activity by these stable antibiotics, failure to detect induced enzyme activity and resistance in the laboratory, and beta-lactam antagonism. The resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents has obvious impact on the selection of appropriate therapy against infections caused by these pathogens. Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides bivius, are organisms frequently recovered from women whose initial therapy for pelvic infection failed. The transfer of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria indicates that these organisms have a system for the spread of such resistance. Therefore determination of antimicrobial susceptibilities and prompt eradication of isolates from infected patients are necessary to delay the emergence of resistant organisms.\r"

Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.\r"

The most frequent errors in the interpretation and application of the fetal biophysical profile are described; in an attempt to minimize the misuse of the fetal biophysical profile, an alternative protocol of antepartum fetal evaluation is suggested based upon the information obtained from the biophysical monitoring of the fetus.\r"

Low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein weekly volume (for example, fewer than 500 specimens per week) will result in a greater than 47% probability that 10% assay drift will not be recognized. Further, laboratory reports to clinicians may lead to either misdirecting 43% more pregnant women (with positive drift) into further (possibly invasive) diagnostic procedures or the offer of further diagnostic services to 32% fewer gravidas at increased risk (with negative drift) than should be so managed. We address the problem outlined above and present the reasons for establishment of regional maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening programs operating at sufficient volume to permit the identification and control of assay drift.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies of exercise-induced amenorrhea have compared amenorrheic athletes (usually runners) with sedentary control subjects. Such comparisons will identify hormonal changes that develop as a result of exercise training but cannot determine which of these changes play a role in causing amenorrhea. To obviate this problem, we assessed reproductive hormone status in a group of five amenorrheic runners and compared them to a group of six eumenorrheic runners matched for body fatness, training intensity, and exercise performance. Compared to the eumenorrheic runners, the amenorrheic runners had lower serum estradiol concentrations, similar basal serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations, and exaggerated responses of serum gonadotropins after administration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (100 micrograms intravenous bolus). Serum prolactin levels, both basally and after thyrotropin-releasing hormone administration (500 micrograms intravenous bolus) or treadmill exercise, was similar in the two groups, as were serum thyroid function tests (including thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone). Changes in serum cortisol levels after short-term treadmill exercise were similar in both groups, and serum testosterone levels increased after exercise only in the eumenorrheic group. In neither group did such exercise change serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or thyrotropin levels. We concluded that exercise-induced amenorrhea is not solely related to the development of increased prolactin output after exercise training. The exaggerated gonadotropin response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone seen in amenorrheic runners in comparison with matched eumenorrheic runners is consistent with a hypothalamic etiology for the menstrual dysfunction, analogous to that previously described in \"stress-induced\" or \"psychogenic\" amenorrhea.\r"

The mean dosage to achieve tocolysis was 4.5 gm/hr, in the magnesium sulfate group and 210.0 micrograms/hr in ritodrine hydrochloride-treated patients. The mean magnesium level to achieve tocolysis was 6.60 mg/dl. Side effects in the two groups were similar in number but less alarming in the magnesium sulfate group. Magnesium sulfate was found to be easy to administer and clinically efficacious. Its tocolytic action was found to be dose dependent and drug concentrations are easily determined. On the basis of this work and data from other investigators, magnesium sulfate should be used as the first line of tocolytic therapy with ritodrine hydrochloride as its pharmacologic backup.\r"

A positive correlation was found between the degree of abnormality of the pulsatility index and A/B ratio and a poor neonatal outcome (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02).

A second- and third-degree polynomial equation best described this curvilinear relationship between trunk circumference and gestational age and between crown-rump length and gestational age. The crown-rump length and trunk circumference were similar in their prediction of gestational age, but the combination of the two parameters did not improve the prediction of gestational age. A nomogram of gestational age as predicted by trunk circumference was generated. These data provide an additional measurement for the estimation of gestational age in the first trimester of pregnancy.\r"

Epidermal growth factor receptor was found to be almost exclusively localized to syncytiotrophoblast, paralleling the immunohistochemical localization of human chorionic gonadotropin. Since epidermal growth factor has been shown to stimulate human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen production by cultured early placental tissue, the present finding that epidermal growth factor receptor was localized to mitotically inactive syncytiotrophoblast suggests a role for epidermal growth factor receptor in the induction of differentiated function of trophoblast rather than trophoblast proliferation. By contrast, myc protein product was found to be predominantly localized to cytotrophoblastic cells, paralleling the autoradiographic distribution of replicating cytotrophoblast identified by tritiated thymidine labeling of placental explant. A close similarity between the cytologic localization of myc protein product and tritiated thymidine labeling of placental explant suggests that myc protein expression is linked to trophoblast proliferation. Furthermore, immunohistochemical cellular levels of both epidermal growth factor receptor and myc protein product were most pronounced in early placenta and declined in term placenta. Thus myc protein product and epidermal growth factor receptor seem to play a crucial role in the induction of trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively, during the development of human placenta.\r"

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (1000 micrograms intravenously) was injected into the mother (n = 8) or fetus (n = 2); serial blood samples were collected from mother and fetus for luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone determination. None of the mothers responded to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist bolus. In contrast, some of the fetal monkeys receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist via placental transfer and all fetal monkeys injected directly with the agonist responded as indicated by increased luteinizing hormone (2.8- to 12.3-fold) and follicle-stimulating hormone (1.5- to 8.9-fold) concentrations. In evaluating maternal and fetal effects, we found that continuous maternal infusion with either gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (n = 14) or saline solution (n = 11) throughout pregnancy did not alter maternal hormonal profiles. Histologically, gonads from their infants, removed within 3 days post partum, were normal. Although neonatal ovarian weights were unaffected by the in utero treatment, the testes weighed less (p less than 0.05) in male infants born of mothers treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist compared to controls. Thus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist can cross from maternal to fetal circulation, and the fetus can respond (at least during the third trimester).\r"

The therapeutic response manifested by improvement in macular function may be related to the proximity of the corticosteroid to the macular area. Lack of therapeutic response to repository corticosteroids may be because of placement at a site relatively far from the target zone.\r"

Outside this optical zone, the dioptric power of the graft surface increased steadily, indicating a progressive steepening of the corneal slope as the graft/host interface is approached. This pattern occurred in patients with accurate and inaccurate refractive results. The center of the graft was noted in some cases to be decentered from the patient's visual axis. The corneal topography analysis system has made clear the need to maximize the diameter of the effective optical zone.\r"

The mean vector corrected change in astigmatism was 8.40 diopters (86%). These results were compared with those of our previous study of relaxing incisions without sutures. Overall, there was a significantly greater decrease in astigmatism (67% vs 47%, P = .009) when augmentation sutures were placed 90 degrees away from the relaxing incisions. Furthermore, in patients with more than 8.50 diopters of astigmatism, relaxing incisions with sutures yielded a much greater reduction in astigmatism compared with relaxing incisions without sutures (70% with sutures vs 39% without sutures, P = .002). We recommend relaxing incisions with augmentation sutures as the initial surgical procedure in eyes with more than 8.50 diopters of astigmatism.\r"

Three monoclonal antibodies were used for the specific localization of PLAP. PLAP was present in some sex cord cells of the 13-16-week fetal ovary, probably germ cells. In normal ovaries, all antigens except carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were frequently found in inclusion cysts; the germinal epithelium was positive only for cancer antigen 125 (CA 125). The frequency and extent of PLAP expression in nonmucinous carcinomas was higher than observed for CA 19-9 and CEA, but was lower than for CA 125 and human milk fat globule antigen. Serous tumors had the highest PLAP expression, followed by endometrioid and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, and some other tumors. PLAP was predominantly membranous; its histologic distribution was in general heterogeneous. Different antibodies to PLAP gave different staining intensities in some tumors, but the staining patterns were always qualitatively identical.\r"

Fourteen antibodies detecting differentiation and structural antigens expressed in the human urinary tract have been used to define the immunoanatomic distribution of these antigenic systems. They include urinary tract antigens (Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein and prostate-specific antigen), tissue-associated antigens (epithelial membrane antigen, Factor VIII antigen, and Protein S-100), and cytoskeletal antigens of the intermediate filament classes (cytokeratins, vimentin, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilaments. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase analyses performed on normal human fetal and adult tissue sections have demonstrated that these antigens are expressed by different cell types and domains of the nephron. Studies correlating normal fetal and adult tissues reveal that some of the antigens appear at distinct stages of maturation, representing early and late antigenic expression events. These antibodies offer a wide range of potential applications that include studies of embryogenesis of the human urinary tract and immunopathologic analyses of neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases of the human kidney and urothelium.\r"

In 95% of B6AF1, 100% of SWRAF1, and 35% of BALB/cBy mice ovarian disease developed, with onset at 5-6 weeks of age. Ovarian disease was not found in D7TX or STX mice. In D3TX mice, it was associated with mononuclear infiltration and ovarian follicle destruction, leading to atrophy. Epididymovasitis was detected in 70-90% of SWRAF1, 50% of B6AF1, and 64% of BALB/cBy mice after D3TX; whereas orchitis occurred in about 20% of SWRAF1 and B6AF1 mice. In some mice epididymovasitis also developed after D7TX, but not after STX. In contrast to the negative immunohistochemical findings in diseased ovaries, typical immune complex-like deposits of mouse IgG were detected by immunofluorescence along the basement membrane of epididymal ducts and seminiferous tubules. However, maximum incidence of epididymitis preceded immune complex detection. Gastritis developed in both female (57%) and male (50%) BALB/cBy mice after D3TX, occasionally after D7TX, but not after STX. Gastric mucosa was hypertrophic with dilated glands and heavy lymphocytic infiltrations throughout all gastric layers. BALB/cBy mice with gastritis usually did not have disease in the gonads, and vice versa. This study, therefore, confirms and extends the findings of Nishizuka and colleagues.\r"

These patients presented with nodular and tumorous skin lesions, which in 10 of 16 cases were confined to a circumscribed area on the trunk. Four patients, all elderly women, presented with skin tumors on the lower legs. Histologically, these 16 lymphomas showed nonepidermotropic diffuse dermal infiltrates, mainly consisting of large follicular center cells, with a variable admixture of small cleaved cells, immunoblasts, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The relative numbers of large cleaved and large noncleaved cells, respectively, varied considerably in these lymphomas. Immunophenotypically, almost all lymphomas expressed monotypic surface immunoglobulins and HLA-DR antigens, whereas all lymphomas were reactive with B-cell-associated monoclonal antisera B1, Leu-14, and/or To15. Three of four elderly female patients presenting with disease on the lower legs died. Of the 12 other patients, 11 are currently alive and in complete remission, which suggests a favorable prognosis for this type of cutaneous large cell lymphoma.\r"

Polyclonal as well as monoclonal keratin antibodies produced equivalent and intense staining of normal epithelium. The immunoreactivity of normal prostate with keratin antibodies was more pronounced than with antibodies to the other components of the cytoskeleton. Variation in staining for components of the cytoskeleton was minimal. The same findings applied to hyperplastic prostate. The immunoreactivity of prostate tumors with antibodies to these cytoskeletal proteins differed markedly from normal prostate. Prostatic carcinomas showed reduced keratin immunoreactivity with a panepithelial antibody, but unaltered or enhanced immunoreactivity with tubulin, actin, and calmodulin antibodies. Many tumors were unreactive with a monoclonal keratin antibody that was strongly reactive with tissues that contained cytokeratin 18 (45-kd) and which intensely stained normal and hyperplastic prostate. In addition, prostate carcinomas often yielded heterogeneous patterns of staining with actin, tubulin, and calmodulin antibodies in contrast to normal and hyperplastic prostate, which showed uniform staining. The results suggest that a disturbance in the organization of the cytoskeleton may accompany neoplastic transformation of human prostate.\r"

Simultaneous multiparameter flow cytometry was used to measure the p21 content in relation to the cell cycle of several cancer cell lines of human origin. These studies revealed that p21 levels rise during the G1 phase of the cycle and remain approximately constant as cells traverse the S and G2 + M phases. The threshold level of p21 expression of S phase cells was used to divide the G1 cell population into cells with low (G1A) and high (G1B) p21 content. The p21 levels of G1B cells were approximately ten times higher than those of G1A cells. The validity of this subdivision was confirmed by synchronous measurements of RNA content and p21. Cells with low RNA content, hence in early part of G1 phase of the cell cycle, expressed low levels of p21, and cells with higher RNA content expressed higher levels of p21. These observations suggest that the levels of p21 are much lower at the onset of the cell cycle than at its end; hence a drop in p21 expression is likely to occur during or immediately after mitotic division.\r"

However, in spite of the obvious dependence of the skin window model on vascular function, its almost exclusive application has been the study of leukocyte function and recovery of the cellular components of inflammatory exudates. In the studies reported here, skin window chambers were employed for assessment of function of the underlying microvasculature in rats given intravenous infusions of Evans blue dye or colloidal carbon. Increased vascular permeability was documented by photometric measurement of Evans blue dye, and vascular labeling of dermal vessels with colloidal carbon was assessed histologically. Zymosan-activated serum elicited accumulation of both leukocytes and Evans blue dye in chamber fluid overlying skin windows, confirming the responsiveness of the preparations. With serotonin as a model vasoactive substance, both increased vascular permeability and vascular labeling were directly related to serotonin concentration in the chamber fluid. It is estimated that plasma exudates were distributed as approximately 10% in the fluid and 90% in the dermis. Finally, serotonin-induced exudates recovered from the 0.3-ml chambers were estimated to be up to 3 microliter of plasma based on Evans blue dye measurement or up to 70 micrograms of protein based on Lowry assay. Thus, soluble components of skin window exudates were recovered for examination, and the dermal microvasculature was shown to be an important functional component of the skin window model that was directly accessible for study.\r"

All tumor cells, irrespective of their specific histologic patterns, contained both vimentin and desmoplakins. Cytokeratin-positive structures were absent or very scant in most tumor regions, but more common in trabecular, insular, macro- and microfollicular structures. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Cytokeratin Polypeptides 8 and 18. Desmin filaments, neurofilaments, and glial filaments were not detected. Immunoelectron microscopy showed vimentin filaments attached to desmoplakin-positive plaques of desmosomes. These results indicate that granulosa cell tumors contain true desmosomes, which are associated primarily with vimentin filaments. This phenomenon has so far only been described in meningiomas and in blastema cells of nephroblastomas. Our observations suggest that in most neoplastic granulosa cells one epithelial feature, ie, cytokeratin expression, is greatly reduced, whereas desmosomes are still formed in appreciable frequencies. This unusual constellation of cytoskeletal elements in granulosa cell tumors may be useful in the differential diagnosis from other ovarian neoplasms, especially undifferentiated carcinomas. The importance of the use of antibodies specific for exclusively desmosomal proteins in classifying morphologically ill-defined junctional structures (eg, \"rudimentary junctions,\" \"primitive junctions,\" \"desmosome-like junctions\") is emphasized.\r"

The authors evaluated the effect of hydrocarbons on pulmonary capillary permeability and binding of heterologous anti-basement membrane antibodies in the lungs after intratracheal instillation of minute amounts of unleaded gasoline into rabbits. The anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies used reacted with the alveolar basement membrane (ABM) in vitro by indirect immunofluorescence. The gasoline treatment altered pulmonary capillary permeability, judging from the increased accumulation of systemically administered radioiodinated bovine serum albumin in the alveolar and extravascular spaces of lungs; it also induced focal macroscopic and microscopic pulmonary histologic lesions. The gasoline caused focal in vivo binding of the anti-GBM antibodies to the ABM detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy. No binding was observed in lungs from control rabbits given saline instillations when assayed by immunofluorescence. The paired label radioisotope technique confirmed the increased antibody binding to lungs injured with gasoline (1.08 +/- 0.03 micrograms) versus 0.37 +/- 0.07 microgram after saline (P less than 0.001). These results indicate that gasoline exposure damages a pulmonary barrier that normally prevents binding of anti-GBM/ABM antibody to ABM and suggest that hydrocarbon exposure may be one of perhaps several pneumotoxic events that contribute to the episodic pulmonary hemorrhage in Goodpasture's syndrome by temporarily allowing ABM binding of anti-basement membrane antibodies.\r"

Control Group C consisted of patients with heroin-associated nephropathy (HAN) with proteinuria comparable to patients in Group A but without AIDS or its related complex (ARC). The most frequent finding, common to both AAN and HAN, was focal glomerular sclerosis. In contrast to HAN, AAN tissue showed mesangial hypocellularity, sparse interstitial infiltrates, severe tubular degenerative changes, tubular microcystic ectasia, Bowman's space dilatation, and presence of multiple complex inclusions both in the nuclei and cytoplasm in a variety of cells. Abundant tubuloreticular inclusions were found in the endothelial and occasionally in the interstitial cell cytoplasm. Nuclear bodies (NBs) were seen in greater frequency, complexity, size, and heterogeneity, and of budding configuration in Group A as compared with Groups B and C; NBs in Group C were mostly of simple types (I and II). In addition, a peculiar granulofibrillary transformation in many tubular and interstitial cell nuclei was observed in Group A. This transformation was rarely present in Group B and was never seen in Group C. Because complex NBs (Types III to V) and various intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions present in Group A are often associated with viral invasion, their presence in kidneys of AIDS patients with proteinuria suggests a viral etiology for AAN.\r"

Both groups have in common the morphologic alterations of inflammatory tuft necrosis, fibrin exudation into the urinary space, crescent formation, and breaks of Bowman's capsule. In the study group, the unique feature of glomeruli with surrounding granulomatous reactions was the presence, within the urinary space, of an exudate of fibrin mixed with immune reactants (immunoglobulins and usually complement) in association with gaps of Bowman's capsule. This contrasts with an exudate of fibrin alone in glomeruli of the control group and other glomeruli of the study group. The study group also had a significantly greater incidence of immune deposits in Bowman's capsule (P less than 0.001). Giant cells may result from the interaction of macrophages of the granuloma with Bowman's capsule that is permeated with immune reactants.\r"

Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA I), specific for galactose, blocked the binding of human anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and anti-tubular basement membrane (TBM) antibodies to renal basement membranes. This lectin also diminished the binding of rabbit anti-laminin antibody, but did not inhibit the binding of mouse anti-fibronectin or rabbit anti-human TBM antibodies. These findings suggest that the binding sites of human anti-GBM and anti-TBM antibodies and heteroantibodies to laminin are closely related to the galactose moieties in glycoproteins of human renal basement membranes. Whether the galactose-containing branches are associated with the nephritogenicity of human anti-GBM and anti-TBM antibodies or simply exist adjacently to the antibody binding sites remains to be discerned.\r"

  ".U": "87154099\r", 
  ".W": "An ELISA employing a novel synthetic peptide consisting of 40 (Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro) repeats of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein, (NANP)40, was used to detect antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein in 132 children, 1 month to 15 years old, from a rural community (Kikwawila village) of Tanzania, a region where malaria is hyperendemic. The children were surveyed comprehensively over 3 consecutive years for clinical, parasitological, and serological parameters. Entomological data were also gathered for selected households in this village. The following results were obtained: anti-(NANP)40 antibodies increased as a function of age; the majority of children over 10 years showed a stable positivity for such antibodies during the longitudinal study; a negative correlation was observed between the levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies and both spleen enlargement and the presence of parasites in thick smears; no relationship was found between anti-(NANP)40 antibodies and asexual blood stage antibodies; children living in two representative households with comparable indoor resting mosquito densities showed markedly different frequencies of anti-(NANP)40 antibodies, in spite of comparable clinical, parasitological, and serological parameters. Thus, in addition to the exposure to infectious mosquito bites, other (e.g., genetic) factors, may play a role in the ability of certain individuals to mount an antibody response against this immunodominant repetitive epitope. The results presented in this paper confirm that the (NANP)40-ELISA represents a simple, reliable means for the detection of anti-(NANP)40 circumsporozoite protein antibodies and suggest that such antibodies may contribute to the immune protection against malaria in humans.\r"

  ".U": "87154100\r", 
  ".W": "Biologically active concentrations of chloroquine increase the pH of the parasite's acid vesicles within 3-5 min. This increase in pH results from two mechanisms, one of which is markedly reduced in chloroquine-resistant parasites. Because chloroquine is a weak base, it increases vesicle pH by that mechanism in chloroquine-susceptible and resistant parasites and mammalian cells (based on its two pKs and on the delta pH between the acid vesicle and the extracellular environment). In chloroquine-susceptible parasites, but not resistant parasites or mammalian cells, chloroquine increases the pH of acid vesicles 700- to 800-fold more than can be accounted for by its properties as a weak base. The increase in acid vesicle pH caused by these non-weak base effects of nanomolar chloroquine in susceptible parasites suggests that chloroquine acts by interfering with acid vesicle functions in the parasite such as the endocytosis and proteolysis of hemoglobin, and the intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes. The non-weak base effects of nanomolar chloroquine on parasite vesicle pH are also responsible for its safety because these chloroquine concentrations do not affect mammalian cells.\r"

Fresh infected blood from this animal was introduced into another splenectomized monkey and was subsequently serially passed through seven intact squirrel monkeys. High level parasitemias (greater than 10%) were obtained in the animals from the last two passes following inoculation of moderate numbers of parasites. It is anticipated that this squirrel monkey-adapted Geneve/SGE-1 strain of P. falciparum will continue to produce high level parasitemias in intact Bolivian Saimiri, and consequently will be suitable for challenge of these monkeys.\r"

Blood samples with rings from 12 patients with falciparum malaria were cultured 30 hr until parasites were mature trophozoites and schizonts. All parasitized erythrocyte isolates bound to thrombospondin, but not to fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, or factor VIII/von Willebrand factor. Parasitized erythrocyte binding varied among isolates, ranging from 192 to 6,725 per mm2, average 2,953. There was good correlation between trophozoite plus schizont % parasitemia and thrombospondin binding (r = 0.884, P less than 0.001). In two patients with stupor, 3,642 and 2,864 parasitized erythrocytes bound per mm2, in proportion to parasitemia, suggesting cerebral malaria is not due to increased binding affinity. These results indicate there is a conserved function among isolates from this geographic region, known to be antigenically diverse at the parasitized erythrocyte membrane surface. These results support the hypothesis that specific binding to an endothelial receptor, possibly involving thrombospondin, plays a role in vascular sequestration in falciparum malaria.\r"

Plasmodium falciparum antigen preparation, obtained from sonicated cultures of the parasite at a parasitemia of 10%-15%, was applied to cellulose filter discs in volumes of 0.1 microliter in 96-well microtiter plates. Antibodies were detected by successive incubations with: bovine serum albumin for blocking, tested serum at different dilutions, peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgG, and the precipitable substrate 4-chloro-1-naphtol. Positive reactions appeared as blue dots on a white background which are easily read by eye. Pools of sera from patients with recent disease or from individuals with a history of malaria, contained antibodies detectable up to a dilution of 1:64,000. Negative results were obtained when normal RBC were used for dotting the filters. Normal sera showed no reaction at any antigen concentration. P. falciparum antigens were detected by their ability to inhibit the binding of antibody to the filters. RBC infected with P. falciparum in vitro can be detected at a level of 0.001% parasitemia. This report presents the feasibility of an assay for detecting malarial antibodies and antigens in blood samples which is easily applicable to field conditions.\r"

Cross-evaluation with the IFA test for P. falciparum antibodies gave 89.6% concording positive or negative results. Among discrepant sera 8.35% were ELISA+/IFA- and 2.05% ELISA-/IFA+. In addition, delta ABS values in ELISA were highly correlated to titers obtained in immunofluorescence (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001). The results confirm the high degree of species-specificity of the ELISA using P. falciparum crude antigen.

In order to determine if antigenic differences resulted in altered biological behavior of host immune responses, two antigenically distinct isolates, WB and GS-E, were used to infect gerbils, and the course of infection, resistance to reinfection, and host humoral responses were measured. Maximum numbers of trophozoites were recovered on day 14 from the intestine of gerbils infected with both isolates, but by day 28, 75% of WB-infected gerbils were free of infection, while GS-E-infected animals continued to be infected until day 42. After curative metronidazole therapy, animals were challenged with the homologous or heterologous isolates. Gerbils previously infected with WB were resistant to challenge with WB and GS-E, while previously GS-E-infected gerbils were more resistant to challenge with the homologous isolate. Antibody responses were measured by ELISA to both surface and cytosol antigens and by IFA to the surface of Giardia. By IFA there was a greater reactivity using the homologous isolate, but with ELISA this was not as apparent. Complement independent cytotoxicity of sera was additionally tested against both isolates. Sera from WB-infected gerbils were cytotoxic to both WB and GS-E whereas sera from GS-E-infected gerbils were cytotoxic to GS-E only. These studies demonstrate that Giardia possessing different surface antigens have different patterns of infection and induce qualitatively and quantitatively different immune responses. Cytotoxicity of sera, most likely antibodies, correlated best with the development of resistance.\r"

Bone trabeculas were present in a randomly scattered fashion with no structural organization. To assess the viability after reaming of the material for continued calcification, implants of the reaming material were placed in a pocket made in the gluteus maximus muscle of 12 rats. After 7 days, the implanted bone spicules showed evidence of tetracycline label uptake, indicating the material obtained after reaming the intramedullary canal was still viable and capable of continued calcification. That the intramedullary canal bone reamings may be a source of bone graft material is interesting. The reamings appear to continue an osteoproductive capacity when used as a graft.\r"

Jugular, subclavian and innominate veins and arteries, the pleura, and the lung are all delineated by supraclavicular and subclavicular scanning, and the needle and catheter can also be visualized. Ultrasonographically-assisted jugular and subclavian venipuncture is a simple and helpful procedure to carry out safe venipuncture.

  ".W": "Drug interactions, defined as when the administration of a single substance (drug, nutrient, or tobacco) modifies the response to a drug, occur relatively frequently in surgical patients and may result in increased morbidity and lengthened hospital stay. Drug interactions also account for some instances of drug ineffectiveness or exaggerated pharmacologic response. There are many types of drug interactions. However, most of them are related to altered drug pharmacokinetic properties, where there are alterations in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination; or altered drug pharmacodynamic actions, where two agents may have synergistic, additive, or antagonistic pharmacologic effects. The term, drug interaction, usually refers to pairs of drug substances administered concurrently, but more than two agents may be involved. When patients are taking a large number of different medications, there may be multiple drug interactions with additive or antagonistic effects, the overall effects of which are difficult to predict. There are hundreds of reported drug interactions, and some may be of important clinical consequence. In surgical patients, the majority of drug interactions involve histamine-2 blockers (particularly cimetidine), digoxin, warfarin, or a variety of agents that may be administered during anesthesia. Recognition of the potential for adverse drug interactions is of primary importance in minimizing their effects. Usually, potentially interacting drugs may be administered concurrently as long as appropriate patient or laboratory assessments are performed. For some agents, such as digoxin or theophylline, serum drug concentrations may aid in the avoidance of adverse drug interactions.\r"

In the prophylactic dopamine group, only two transplant operations (9.5%) were complicated by renal impairment, whereas in the other group, 10 patients (67%) developed renal impairment (p = 0.001); of these, four developed acute renal failure (27%). Comparison of seven pairs of patients, matched for age, sex, diagnosis, operative blood loss and operative hypotension (one group receiving dopamine, the other not), revealed a significantly higher urine output in the first 24 hours and creatinine clearance 24-48 hours after surgery (p less than 0.05) in those treated prophylactically.

  ".W": "We have presented a review of recent advances in medical imaging which are relevant to the practice of anesthesia and associated research. The appropriate interpretation and use of the information derived from these noninvasive technologies can prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Echocardiography remains the most advanced tool for noninvasive cardiac imaging because of its applicability for most cardiac disorders and its exquisite spatial resolution. Two-dimensional systems produce real time, dynamic, qualitative assessments of cardiac chamber morphology, size, thickness, and performance. The development of transesophageal echocardiography has brought this imaging power into the operating room for use by anesthesiologists. Recently developed quantitative and color-coded Doppler techniques will reveal intracardiac flow patterns and their alterations by anesthetics and surgery. These advantages are partially offset by inherent difficulties in quantifying echocardiographic data, and the need for highly trained operators for image reproduction. Nuclear cardiology and echocardiology are highly complementary. The scintigraphic methods identify myocardium at risk for infarction, confirm infarction when present, and produce quantitative, highly reproducible estimates of ventricular filling and performance. Time required to obtain data can be very brief for first-pass techniques, and these data are ideally suited for computer processing. Equilibrium studies require a larger dose of radioactive material, but provide excellent assessment of segmental wall motion. Preoperative studies with dipyridamole and Tl can indicate the patients truly at high risk for perioperative myocardial infarction. Monitoring and intensive care efforts may be better allocated with this information. No new technology in the past decade has stirred as much interest among clinicians as magnetic resonance imaging. Like echocardiography, it uses no ionizing radiation and is entirely noninvasive. But, unlike other imaging techniques, it utilizes multiple tissue characteristics to provide quick, highly resolved, tomographic images. Since bone is invisible to the magnetic resonance scanner, tissues inside bony structures are often best revealed with MRI. Nonimaging studies, i.e., spectroscopic data not spatially encoded, may prove to be the most important research currently underway in this field. In vivo estimates of intracellular functions, enzyme kinetics, and drug kinetics and metabolism are already in progress. The effects of anesthetic in the central nervous system and other organs may be explored in ways previously not possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With regard to existence of high prostacyclin (PGI2) levels during atheromatosis and thrombus formation, resistance of platelets to prostacyclin and its analogues seems to play an important pathophysiologic key role for the clarifying of vasoocclusive phenomena. Platelet resistance to prostacyclin was studied in vitro and ex vivo in 160 atherosclerotic patients (assessed by objective diagnostic criteria) with and without thrombotic complications and in 50 controls. Prostacyclin resistance phenomena were more pronounced and frequent in patients with occlusive complications, the difference from controls being statistically significant. However, there was no significant difference between the controls and the nonthrombotic patient sample. The intraplatelet cAMP levels might be the metabolic basis of the PGI2 resistance phenomenon, because in the patient group, platelet cAMP levels were decreased by 50% after Ca2+ stimulation. Compared to controls beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane B2 plasma levels were significantly increased (30 +/- 9 to 87 +/- 26 ng/ml and 9 +/- 5 to 54 +/- 21 pg/ml, respectively), confirming the hyperreactivity state of resistant platelets. From the therapeutic point of view, patients with resistant platelets require PGI2 doses that cause, however, increased side effects. We were able to demonstrate in vivo that IV pretreatment with pentoxifylline--a known stimulator of cAMP formation in platelets--followed by a simultaneous and continuous IV infusion of PGI2 + pentoxifylline, permitted us to reduce significantly the mean PGI2 doses needed for triggering an antiplatelet effect, without inducing side effects. In ex vivo studies, PGI2 resistant platelets of atherosclerotic patients pretreated with pentoxifylline showed normalized stimulation response, and platelet cAMP levels increased from 7.8 +/- 2.7 to 15.2 +/- 1.9 pmol/10(8) platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It does not duplicate information provided by other noninvasive methods, because, whereas Dopplers give an indication of flow and degree of stenosis in the artery, thermography measures the actual hypoperfusion as demonstrated by diminished temperature in areas of the forehead supplied by branches of the ophthalmic artery. A 74-year-old man presented with bilateral carotid distribution TIAs. Carotid Dopplers and angiography revealed 99% occlusion of both internal carotid arteries. Contact thermography showed diminished temperature in the right supraorbital artery territory. The patient subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy. Following induction of anesthesia but prior to carotid clamping, the patient became transiently hypotensive. Intraoperative EEG monitoring showed marked attenuation of the background rhythm on the right with preservation of background on the left. Normal rhythm was quickly restored with pharmacologic restoration of the blood pressure. This case illustrates the usefulness of thermography, which predicted the hemisphere in jeopardy when Dopplers and angiography showed equal bilateral disease.\r"

  ".U": "87154517\r", 
  ".W": "Ten patients with Stage II chronic arterial occlusive disease (intermittent claudication) took part in a randomized, intraindividual crossover study involving acute intravenous administration of 200 mg pentoxifylline or physiological saline solution (placebo). The tissue oxygen tension (pO2) response (pO2 kinetics) following treatment with placebo revealed a nominal but statistically nonsignificant increase in arithmetic mean and median pO2 immediately after the end of exercise. Values thereafter reverted approximately to the initial values recorded at rest. Comparison of the pooled pO2 histograms during the individual periods before and after the end of exercise, however, revealed a broadening of the histogram base, reflecting both higher pO2 values and, more particularly, increased numbers of hypoxic and anoxic pO2 values. This is interpreted as an expression of nonhomogeneous capillary perfusion (maldistribution). Following administration of pentoxifylline to the same patients, there was a statistically significant increase in mean and median pO2 at ten and twenty minutes after the end of exercise. Even after thirty and sixty minutes, these values were in some cases still clearly higher than the initial preexercise values. Study of the pooled pO2 histograms discloses a right shift compared with the initial preexercise histograms. This suggests that pentoxifylline exerts a positive effect on maldistribution by making capillary perfusion more homogeneous. The results support the conclusion that, in the context of reactive hyperemia after muscular exercise, tissue oxygen supply is markedly improved by pentoxifylline in comparison with saline solution. The measurement of tissue pO2 before and at intervals after pedal ergometer exercise is a new objective technique for assessing the efficacy of blood flow-promoting therapy, permitting close simulation of the pathophysiological situation in the muscles of the lower leg in intermittent claudication.\r"

  ".W": "Occupational immunologic lung diseases either asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis, can occur in a wide variety of occupations from numerous antigens. New OILD syndromes and antigens are being reported constantly. In the case of some occupational agents that have been reported like isocyanates, formaldehyde, and Western red cedar, there is current investigation into the incidence of disease, mechanisms, and appropriate diagnostic criteria. A key principle in OILD is that prevention or at least early treatment by environmental control should be the goal. Determination of threshold limits for sensitization and adherence to these limits would be useful, for instance. In manufacturing processes in which this is not possible, workers and management in high risk industries should be educated so that affected workers are recognized early and avoidance can be instituted. Currently, there are no pre-employment screening criteria that have been shown to be very useful in predicting OILD. Prospective studies of animal handlers are underway and may provide useful information. In the case of TMA-exposed workers, prospective studies have demonstrated that serial immunologic studies are useful in predicting workers at risk for OILD and that reduction of airborne exposure will reduce prevalence. This sort of approach will probably be useful in studying other occupational agents. Such studies are complex and, to succeed, generally require cooperation and collaboration of physicians, industry, labor, industrial hygiene, and governmental agencies.\r"

The PHI was accurate in predicting the need for emergency life-saving surgery within four hours (P less than .0001) and mortality within 72 hours (P less than .0001) following traumatic injury. The curves were generated for PHI versus emergency surgery, mortality, surgery and mortality, injury severity score, and ICU admission rate.

For this purpose, lung tissue from 10 patients with and 10 patients without COPD was obtained during thoracotomies. Lung function was measured preoperatively. The in vitro responses of isolated bronchioles were measured using histamine, leukotriene (LT)C4, and methacholine as contracting agents, and the results of the in vitro measurements were compared between patients with and without COPD. Histamine efficacy (maximal isometric force, Tmax) in vitro of bronchioles from patients with COPD was significantly greater than the histamine Tmax of the bronchioles from patients without COPD (p less than 0.01). This difference was probably not due to histamine tachyphylaxis or the production of relaxing prostaglandins by airways without COPD, as neither mechanism could be detected in separate experiments on airways without COPD. No differences were found between in vitro bronchiolar responses to LTC4 and methacholine in patients with and patients without COPD. Increased histamine responses of small airways may be one of the determinants of airway obstruction in COPD.\r"

Airway responsiveness to methacholine is a sensitive indicator of the presence and severity of asthma. Therefore, we studied the effect of BAL on methacholine airway responsiveness in stable asthmatics. Geometric mean methacholine PC20 was 1.34 mg/ml before and 1.80 mg/ml after BAL (p = 0.26) in asthmatics. Immediate symptoms of airway narrowing after BAL occurred only in the 3 asthmatics with moderate to severe hyperresponsiveness. These symptoms were rapidly relieved by inhaled bronchodilator. There was no relationship between the occurrence of symptoms and the amount of topical lidocaine used for local anaesthesia or the volume of lavage fluid returned. The absence of an effect of BAL on airway responsiveness supports the safety of this procedure in the controlled asthmatic patient with near normal FEV1, irrespective of the level of baseline airway responsiveness.\r"

The initial rates of amino acid transport were determined by measuring the uptake of the nonmetabolizable amino acid, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Alveolar type II epithelial cells transported AIB by a sodium-dependent process that displayed saturable kinetics. Insulin stimulated transport of 0.1 mM AIB (82.3 +/- 15.0%, mean +/- SE, n = 4) with a half-maximally effective insulin concentration of 2.2 +/- 1.0 ng/ml (mean +/- SE), which is within the physiologic range of rat serum insulin concentration. Kinetic analysis of AIB transport showed that insulin increased the Vmax from 6.7 +/- 1.2 nmol/10(6) cells/min to 9.3 +/- 1.8 nmol/10(6) cells/min and had no effect on the Km value (5.2 +/- 0.8 mM). Alpha-(methylamino) isobutyric acid, a specific substrate for amino acid transport system A, inhibited both the sodium-dependent and insulin-modulated transport of AIB. Thus, alveolar type II epithelial cells transport amino acids in a sodium-dependent process and insulin stimulates this transport. The present study indicates that insulin may play a physiologic role in regulating amino acid transport in alveolar type II epithelial cells.\r"

Pulmonary function tests were performed more than 1 yr after ARDS. Percent of predicted FVC correlated with CTH (r = 0.66, p less than 0.01) and PAP (r = 0.53, p less than 0.05), and percent of predicted TLC correlated with CTH (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01), PEEP (r = -0.55, p less than 0.05), and Qsp/Qt (r = -0.53, p less than 0.05). Only TO2 correlated with percent of predicted DLCO (r = -0.53, p less than 0.05). Five of 7 ARDS survivors with an abnormal DLCO were supported at FlO2 greater than 0.6 for more than 24 h, whereas all of 9 survivors with a normal DLCO received FlO2 greater than 0.6 for less than 24 h. We conclude that physiologic markers of ARDS severity during the acute illness correlate with residual pulmonary dysfunction after recovery from ARDS. Support with FlO2 greater than 0.6 for more than 24 h appears to be a sensitive and specific predictor of an abnormally reduced DLCO more than 1 yr after ARDS.\r"

The time course of appearance of the enzyme and the extent of its increase corresponded to the known events of endotoxin-induced capillary injury. Accordingly, activity was low in the first phase of endotoxin-induced increased lung lymph flow caused by increased pressure filtration but was high in the second phase of increased lung lymph flow caused by increased permeability filtration. Recovery was associated with a decrease of activity to preinfusion levels. Capillary damage and increased permeability filtration induced by air emboli or oleic acid led to a similar increase in lung lymph proteolytic activity. By contrast lung lymph proteolytic activity remained virtually unchanged during increased pressure filtration induced by inflation of a balloon in the left atrium. Activity also remained unchanged in thoracic duct lymph, indicating that the increased activity in lung lymph is not an expression of a generalized response to endotoxin. The enzyme, a serine protease with a molecular weight of about 70,000 to 75,000 and a pH optimum between 7.3 and 7.6, was not related to lymph clotting and was not capable of correcting the clotting defects of plasmas deficient in enzymes of the clotting cascade. These results together with specificity studies indicate that the enzyme represents a new, hitherto unidentified, protease. Measurements of its activity in lung lymph represent a sensitive marker of lung capillary injury.\r"

Using this model, we evaluated the effect of pretreatment of rats with a human monoclonal antibody specific to the core glycolipid that is common to all endotoxins. We found that pretreatment prevented the increased clearance of 99mTcDTPA from the lung, as well as the increase in lipid peroxidation products in the serum. The antibody did not prevent increased neutrophil accumulation in the lung. The findings suggest that the administration of human antiendotoxin monoclonal antibodies prior to endotoxemia may prevent some of the changes in the lung associated with endotoxin.\r"

In the area of normal epithelium, SC was synthesized by mucous cells, particularly by small mucous granule cells. It was also found with small mucous granules in both superficial columnar or cuboidal cells in the area of stratification and superficial, less flattened cells in the area of epidermoid metaplasia, but SC was not identified in polygonal cells under the superficial SC-positive cells in both of the above areas. These superficial cells containing SC and small mucous granules possessed increasing number of tonofilaments parallel with the degree of flattening of the surface cells. On the other hand, in the advanced epidermoid metaplasia, in which surface cells were composed of very flattened cells, SC and small mucous granules were not found in the bronchial epithelium. Tonofilaments increased in number in the cytoplasm parallel to morphologic changes from basal cells to outermost flattened cells, via polygonal cells. These findings suggest that small mucous granule cells containing SC could gradually change to flattened cells through a quantitative change of a cytoplasmic component, such as SC or tonofilaments, and constitute the superficial cells of initial epidermoid metaplasia, in which surface cells are composed of less flattened cells. Moreover, these findings suggested that basal cells play an important role in epidermoid differentiation.\r"

Daytime arterial PO2 and PCO2 improved after therapy. There are several advantages over commonly used, negative pressure devices for nocturnal ventilation. These include patient synchronization of tidal volume, ease of application, less cumbersome apparatus, more nocturnal patient mobility, and absence of production of upper airway obstruction.\r"

Surgical exploration should be through a transperitoneal approach with the patient positioned such that access to the chest can be obtained for maximum exposure and resection. Chemotherapy consisting of actinomycin D and vincristine should be instituted in all patients. Radiation therapy must also be considered in any patient with the diagnosis of nephroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated human monocytes generate tissue factor when stimulated with endotoxins. This tissue factor generation provides a convenient marker of monocyte activation. Furthermore, the only circulating blood cell capable of generating large quantities of tissue factor is the monocyte. Therefore, the addition of endotoxin to citrated blood, and the determination of the recalcification times after incubation, yields a measure of monocyte activation. In order to determine whether monocyte activation as measured by this technique varies between patients with carcinoma and healthy volunteers, recalcification times were evaluated. The recalcification time and range for 19 healthy volunteers (controls) was 6.55 min (5.3-8.5) for the saline incubated sample and 5.69 min (4.6-7.2) for the endotoxin-activated sample. The results for 13 patients with carcinoma are 4.81 min (3.3-6.3) for the former and 3.17 min (2.0-4.3) for the latter. These results show that the longest recalcification time with endotoxin incubation for patients with carcinoma was lower than the lowest recalcification time in the control group. Whether this simple test can be of use in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with carcinomas is currently being investigated.\r"

Design: nonrandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 14-week treatment periods and 4-week washout periods. Setting: academic medical center, referral-based rheumatology clinic. Patients: forty volunteers with active, definite, or classical rheumatoid arthritis. Five patients dropped out, and two were removed for noncompliance. Interventions: treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, slow-acting antirheumatic drugs, and prednisone was continued. Twenty-one patients began with a daily dosage of 2.7 g of eicosapaentanic acid and 1.8 g of docosahexenoic acid given in 15 MAX-EPA capsules (R.P. Scherer, Clearwater, Florida), and 19 began with identical-appearing placebos. The background diet was unchanged. Measurements and Main Results: the following results favored fish oil placebo after 14 weeks: mean time to onset of fatigue improved by 156 minutes (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 311.0 minutes), and number of tender joints decreased by 3.5 (95% Cl, -6.0 to -1.0). Other clinical measures favored fish oil as well but did reach statistical significance. Neutrophil leukotriene B4 production was correlated with the decrease in number of tender joints (Spearman rank correlation r=0.53; p less than 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in hemoglobin level, sedimentation rate, or presence of rheumatoid factor or in patient-reported adverse effects. An effect from the fish oil persisted beyond the 4-week washout period. Conclusions: fish-oil ingestion results in subjective alleviation of active rheumatoid arthritis and reduction in neutrophil leukotriene B4 production. Further studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms of action and optimal dose and duration of fish-oil supplementation.\r"

Design: randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with a maximum 18-hour treatment period. Setting: emergency room and medical floors of a non-referral city hospital. Patients: consecutive sample of 36 patients with atrial fibrillation of 7 days' duration or less, not on digitalis glycoside or anti-arrhythmic agents, with ventricular rate between 85 to 175 beats/min, without evidence of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, preexcitation syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, hypokalemia, renal impairment, or severe metabolic disturbances. Interventions: digoxin solution in capsules or identical placebo, given in doses of 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 mg, at 0, 4, 8, and 14 hours, respectively, or until conversion to sinus rhythm, whichever occurred first. Continuous electrocardiographic recording by Holter monitor. Measurements and Main Results: nine of eighteen patients receiving digoxin and 8 of 18 receiving placebo had a return to sinus rhythm within 18 hours of study entry (95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions, -11% to 22%). Mean time to conversion was 5.1 hours in the digoxin group and 3.3 in the placebo group (95% Cl, -3.6 to 7.0 hours). Conclusions: spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm is common in patients with atrial fibrillation of recent onset. Digitalization was not shown to affect the likelihood of reversion to sinus rhythm, and thus cannot be recommended for this purpose in patients with atrial fibrillation.\r"

The TWAR strain has been shown to cause mild pneumonia in teenagers and young adults. Of the 301 patients, 18 (6%) had serologic evidence of recent infection with the TWAR organism. Their mean age was 64 years. Pneumonia associated with the presence of acute TWAR antibody had no characteristic clinical or radiographic features when compared with pneumonia without acute chlamydia antibody. Six patients, who all had preexisting serious chronic disease, had severe illness, and 2 died. Both patients who died had complicated hospital courses and other concomitant infections. We conclude that the TWAR organism may cause pneumonia in older adults and persons with chronic diseases that require hospitalization.\r"

Marked elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels and lesser changes in hepatic aminotransferase levels are common. Although abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography detect ductal abnormalities, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography best shows precise ductal irregularities and provides therapeutic intervention. Prompt relief of symptoms follows endoscopic sphincterotomy, often with resolution of biochemical evidence of cholestasis.

When the data from these trials are categorized according to the criteria used for the diagnoses of bleeding (either occult blood detection or clinically overt bleeding), there was no significant difference between antacids and cimetidine in the prevention of overt bleeding (3.3% of 458 compared with 2.7% of 402 patients who bled, respectively; p = 0.69). In addition, both agents were more effective (p less than 0.001) than placebo (15% of 720 patients who bled) in the prevention of overt bleeding.

Insomnia, the commonest sleep disorder, is more prevalent among women and elderly and psychosocially disadvantaged persons. Personality factors such as a tendency toward the internalization of emotions and the occurrence of stressful life events also play a major role in the development of chronic insomnia. A multidimensional approach is indicated for the treatment of chronic insomnia; hypnotic drugs should be used only as an adjunct to this treatment. In children, sleepwalking and night terrors (two manifestations of the same pathophysiologic substrate), nightmares, and enuresis are commonly related to developmental factors; counseling and reassurance of the parents is indicated. Psychopathologic disorders are usually present in secondary enuresis, as well as in sleepwalking, night terrors, and nightmares that occur in adulthood. Psychotherapy and the occasional use of psychotropic drugs may be necessary in the treatment given adults with these disorders.\r"

Seven children were given intramuscular adrenocorticotrophic hormone followed by oral prednisolone with sulphasalazine. Two children were withdrawn from the trial. The elemental diet was equally effective in inducing an improvement in Lloyd-Still disease activity index, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein and albumin concentrations, and body weight as the high dose steroid regimen. Linear growth, assessed from height velocity over six months, was significantly greater in the children receiving an elemental diet.\r"

  ".U": "87155425\r", 
  ".W": "The dipstrip test for urinary nitrite is fairly unreliable in symptomatic urinary infections and only 104 (52%) of 200 symptomatic children with urinary infection attending an emergency department had a positive result. The test yielded positive results, however, in 83 of 100 outpatients with largely asymptomatic urinary infection attending a follow up clinic because of known predisposition to urinary infection. This difference was highly significant. The finding of urinary nitrite is highly specific for urinary infection and only 1% of 300 uninfected urine specimens gave a positive result. After addition of a broth culture of Escherichia coli to sterile urine incubation at 37 degrees C for four to six hours was required before the nitrite test yielded positive results. This suggests that frequency of micturition in urinary infection reduces the reliability of the nitrite test. On the other hand, the use of overnight, first morning urine specimens may further improve the sensitivity. If nitrite testing is used for screening for urinary infection at home, however, patients should be warned not to rely on a negative result in the presence of symptoms of urinary infection.\r"

The IRG in the HV rose within 40 seconds and in the PA rose within 60 seconds after the injection of secretin into a feeding artery, but not after secretin was injected into a nonfeeder. These results indicated that secretin directly stimulates a gastrinoma to release gastrin in vivo. The selective arterial secretin injection test (SASI test) was applied in three patients in whom gastrinomas could not be located by computed tomography, ultrasonography, or arteriography, and functioning gastrinomas were located in all three patients. In one patient, malignant gastrinomas in the head of the pancreas and in the duodenum could be resected radically with the help of this test.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized study the clinical and bacteriologic effectiveness of imipenem was compared with the classical combination of netilmicin with clindamycin in patients who had surgery for an intraperitoneal infection, localized or generalized, with positive bacteriologic findings of the specimen taken at surgery. Excluded were all patients who received other antibiotics before surgery, or who died within 3 days after antibiotic therapy was started. Imipenem was given at a dose of 500 mg t.i.d., clindamycin 600 mg t.i.d., and netilmicin according to serum levels. The diagnoses ranged from postoperative peritonitis, gallbladder empyema, perforated gastroduodenal ulcer, small bowel perforation with and without obstruction, and perforated appendicitis to perforation of the colon. The bacteriologic work-up included examination of the primary specimen (aerobic and anaerobic), the urine, feces, and serologic testing for Candida albicans once or twice a week and after the course of antibiotic therapy. In addition, pH measurements of abscesses and drainage fluids were performed. Ninety-three patients entered the study. Forty-seven patients were treated with imipenem (test group), and 46 patients were treated with the combination therapy (control group). The two groups did not show significant differences in age, sex, diagnostic groups, risk factors, primary bacteriology, and duration of therapy (mean: 6.7 days). Thirty-eight patients (80.9%) treated with imipenem were cured, six patients (12.8%) were improved, and there were three (6.4%) failures. The respective numbers for the control group were 31 (67.4%), 10 (21.7%), and 5 (10.9%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 19 days for the test group and 24.5 days for the control group. There were four wound infections in the test group and 11 wound infections in the control group. Imipenem is at least as effective in the adjuvant therapy of intra-abdominal infections as the combination of netilmicin with clindamycin.\r"

The patients had varying levels of metabolic stress (0-3) after major surgery, polytrauma, or surgical sepsis. The study was isocaloric and isonitrogenous and lasted for 7 days. The patients received either a standard amino acid formula (SAA) (Travasol) or a 50% branched chain enriched formula that was equimolar, leucine, isoleucine, and valine (MAA) (Travasol + Branchamin concentrate) at a dose of 1.0-2.0 g/kg/day in a fixed ratio with 114 glucose calories per gram of nitrogen administered. The nitrogen retention was proportionate to the nitrogen (and, therefore, caloric) load in both groups. The MAA group, however, had better nitrogen retention, reached nitrogen equilibrium at a lower dose of amino acids, and had less urinary nitrogen excretion per gram of nitrogen administered. Since the groups were isonitrogenous and the calorie to nitrogen ratios were fixed, it appears that nitrogen equilibrium in surgical stress is proportionate to the amino acid load over a range of 0.05-0.4 g/kg/day of nitrogen; and that MAA are more efficient at inducing nitrogen retention and a reduction in urea excretion. These effects on nitrogen retention were more significant at level 2 stress or greater. At these higher stress levels, a dose of 2 +/- 0.2 g/kg/day of MAA seemed most efficient in promoting nitrogen retention.\r"

There were 37 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (ACC) from a total of 40,350 invasive breast tumors. Patient survival, complications, and pathologic sections were reviewed. Only 14 of 27 surgical pathology slides available for review could be confirmed histologically as ACC. All patients were white females with a mean age of 64 years. The tumor remained localized to the breast in all cases. Nine patients had either radical or modified radical mastectomy, four patients had either simple mastectomy or lumpectomy, and one patient refused treatment. There was no evidence of axillary node involvement, metastases, or local recurrence after excision. At the time of follow-up, nine patients were alive and disease free and four died of disease unrelated to their breast cancer. The one patient who died of breast cancer had a radical mastectomy and survived 11.7 years after diagnosis. It is concluded that ACC has a favorable biologic behavior characterized by a prolonged clinical course and good prognosis. Simple mastectomy is all that is required as initial treatment, and a chest x-ray and thorough physical examination looking for local recurrence is all that is needed for follow-up.\r"

CMV titers were measured in all patients before transplantation by an immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Recipients similarly had CMV titers measured at selected intervals after transplant and during febrile episodes. Appropriate viral cultures were simultaneously performed. Laboratory evidence of infection was correlated with symptoms and signs of active CMV disease. Mean follow-up period was 20 +/- 12 months with a range of 3-51 months. Three patients were excluded due to early acute rejection resulting in graft loss. Twenty-eight of 41 donors (68%) and 22 of 41 recipients (54%) had positive CMV titers before transplantation. Six of 41 recipients (15%) subsequently developed clinical and laboratory evidence of CMV infection: three of 19 seronegative recipients and three of 22 seropositive recipients. All six patients received kidneys from seropositive donors. Four patients had severe CMV disease (2 seronegative, 2 seropositive), whereas two patients had leukopenia and fever only. Two patients with severe CMV infections subsequently lost their grafts due to unrelated causes. Overall, actual patient and graft survival of the entire group is 95% and 82%, respectively. In conclusion, individuals who receive LRD kidneys from seronegative individuals are unlikely to develop CMV infection, and transplantation of seropositive LRD kidneys may be associated with transmission of CMV in susceptible recipients regardless of their serologic status. With appropriate management of CMV illness in the posttransplant period, LRD kidney donation is safe and efficacious and should not be discouraged on the basis of pretransplant CMV serology in any donor-recipient pairing.\r"

This report is based on our experience with 6 patients in whom a mucocele developed following esophageal replacement. Esophageal replacement was performed on 37 patients over a 10-year period at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital. A symptomatic mucocele requiring excision developed in 3 patients with achalasia, 1 with congenital tracheoesophageal fistula, 1 with esophageal atresia, and 1 with inflammatory stricture. Conduits used included stomach (4), reversed gastric tube (1), and colon (1). Our experience indicates that conversion of a closed-loop esophagus into a symptomatic mucocele is more likely in the presence of functioning, chronically irritated mucosa. The clinical features were referable to the mucocele itself or respiratory embarrassment therefrom. Thoracic roentgenograms and computed tomographic scans were diagnostic in verifying the presence of the esophageal mucocele. All five mucoceles arose from squamous epithelium. One of 3 patients with achalasia in whom a mucocele developed following esophageal replacement had premalignant changes in the mucosa. Based on this experience, our treatment of choice is early, complete excision of the mucocele.\r"

The effect of concomitant hemothorax was also tested. Gram-negative infection was found to have a more virulent course than Gram-positive infection in the thoracic cavity. Moreover, these findings support the thesis that intrathoracic inoculation of anaerobic bacteria, even in combination with other anaerobic species, fails to produce clinical empyemas. However, anaerobic bacteria appear to enhance synergistically the virulence of sublethal and subempyema-forming concentrations of aerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.\r"

The purpose was to determine which regimen would maximally inhibit platelet function without depressing vascular prostacyclin synthesis. Serum thromboxane A2, saphenous vein wall and aortic wall prostacyclin, platelet aggregation, and bleeding time were measured in all patients. None was restarted on a regimen of aspirin or dipyridamole postoperatively. Aspirin alone and in combination with dipyridamole significantly inhibited thromboxane A2 and platelet aggregation in all treated patients but spared venous prostacyclin synthesis. Aortic prostacyclin synthesis was partially inhibited in both treated groups. Chest tube drainage was comparable in all three groups. These results indicate that the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole offers no measurable advantage over aspirin alone in the perioperative period.\r"

Up to 50% of all nosocomial legionellosis in the hospitals reviewed was found in surgical patients. Patients undergoing a transplant procedure are at highest risk, but occurrence is common in the surgical patient undergoing general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation, or both. Aerosolization, aspiration, and direct instillation of contaminated water during manipulation of the respiratory tract are likely mechanisms of transmission. The usual clinical presentation is that of a nonspecific pneumonia. Specialized laboratory techniques including selective culture media, direct fluorescent antibody stains, and serological detection of antibodies are necessary for accurate diagnosis. If these tests are not routinely available, Legionnaires' disease may remain undiagnosed. Environmental surveillance of the hospital water distribution system is advisable for hospitals with a large surgical case load. If transplantation is performed, such surveillance is mandatory.\r"

A few years later, in 1941, he applied this theory by introducing thymectomy for nonthymomatous myasthenia and achieved similar improvement. Despite modern sophisticated knowledge about the disease and advances in thoracic surgical techniques, Blalock's original observations remain valid, and thymectomy has become a standard treatment for myasthenia gravis the world over.\r"

This review puts the use of beta-blockers as monotherapy for hypertension in perspective and provides reasons for choosing among the several beta-blockers available. The major reasons for discriminating within this class of drugs are related to differences in concomitant clinical conditions, differences in patient responses, and intrinsic differences among the beta-blockers. These differences relate to special properties such as beta-agonist activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), beta 1-selectivity, and concomitant alpha-blockade, as well as differences in side effect profiles, excretion characteristics, and length of action of the various drugs.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study was performed between 1982 and 1985 to assess the ability of ketoconazole to prevent fungal infections in selected patients with cancer. Fifty-six patients receiving induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia, autologous bone marrow transplant for refractory nonhematopoietic malignant neoplasms, multidrug chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma, or corticosteroids for brain metastases were randomized to receive either oral ketoconazole, 400 mg/d, or placebo and observed until leukopenia resolved or corticosteroid therapy was stopped. Oral candidiasis developed in eight (28%) of 29 patients receiving placebo compared with none of 27 receiving ketoconazole. However, ketoconazole failed to prevent Candida esophagitis and vulvovaginitis in two patients and one patient, respectively. Furthermore, prophylactic use of ketoconazole did not significantly alter the total number of hospital days, febrile days, or antibiotic days or the requirement for amphotericin B in patients with acute leukemia and autologous bone marrow transplant. Since oral candidiasis can be successfully managed by several different treatment modalities when it does occur, we do not think that the routine prophylactic use of ketoconazole is justified.\r"

In addition, 14 of these 16 patients in the placebo group had their first arrhythmia (in the intensive coronary-care unit) within two hours after the start of the study, whereas in the magnesium-treated group, there were no such arrhythmias until some four hours later. The higher the lymphocyte potassium concentration, the greater the reduction in the incidence of arrhythmias. Serum magnesium levels increased by 16.5% and lymphocyte magnesium concentrations by 72% in the magnesium treated group. Intravenous magnesium reduces the incidence of serious arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Drug-free obsessive-compulsive subjects did not differ from controls on measures of platelet serotonin and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, nor on plasma epinephrine or norepinephrine concentrations at rest and after a standard orthostatic challenge procedure. Compared with placebo, treatment with clomipramine was clinically effective and produced a marked decrease in platelet serotonin concentration, a trend toward a reduction in platelet MAO activity, and a rise in standing plasma norepinephrine. Clinical improvement during drug therapy was closely correlated with pretreatment platelet serotonin concentration and MAO activity, as well as with the decrease in both measures during clomipramine administration. This suggests that the effects of clomipramine on serotonin uptake may be essential to the antiobsessional action observed.\r"

There have been few attempts to identify the patients whose conditions improve as a result of true drug effect, in contrast with improvement that is a result of nonspecific effects. In a previous report we demonstrated that true drug effect seemed to be characterized by a two-week delay in onset and persistence. We described a method of pattern analysis to identify such patients. In this report, we describe the use of pattern analysis to replicate our initial findings. Data from a new sample of 150 nonmelancholic patients support the hypothesis that true drug effect is characterized by a two-week delay in onset and persistence of improvement, once achieved. There was little evidence of the onset of antidepressant effect before two weeks. The theoretical and clinical implications of this work are discussed.\r"

CLinical and experimental studies both indicate that the occurrence of TRI in AIDS, systemic lupus erythematosus, or viral infections is directly related to endogenous systemic or local elevations of type I interferons (interferons alpha or beta). Moreover, these inclusions develop in patients or rhesus monkeys undergoing interferon alpha treatment. Rarely had CCC been reported in human tissue before the AIDS epidemic, but they were well known to develop in the hepatocytes of chimpanzees after experimental inoculation with human non-A, non-B hepatitis agent. In AIDS, CCC frequently coexist with TRI, and their appearance is associated with disease progression. A relationship of CCC to type I interferons is indicated by recent in vitro investigations, but clinical discordances in their appearance of TRI, and CCC suggest some differences in their pathogenesis, possibly related to cellular susceptibility or etiologic cofactors.\r"

The acini were lined by columnar, and focally, by basal (myoepithelial) cells; the latter were more clearly demonstrated with immunoperoxidase stains for cytokeratin and S100 protein. In our opinion, the lesion represents a rare variant of benign prostatic hyperplasia analogous to sclerosing adenosis of the breast.\r"

There were nine men and two women ranging in age from 25 to 47 years (mean, 38.5 years). All pancreatic grafts were extraperitoneal, and the pancreatic duct was managed by pancreaticocystostomy utilizing an internal stent. Three patients died from two to six weeks postoperatively of septic complications. Four pancreatic grafts were functioning at 2, 5, 11, and 14 months after operation, and eight patients had had functioning renal allografts from two to 14 months (mean, 6.8 months) with a mean serum creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL (210 mumol/L). Graft failure occurred in the other four patients from vascular thrombosis (three patients) or hemorrhagic pancreatitis (one patient). Significant morbidity included an infected arterial anastomosis (two patients), pancreatic fistulas (four patients), and bladder leak (four patients). In conclusion, this procedure is an effective option for selective diabetics with end-stage renal disease. Although technical complications were frequent, no adverse effect on renal allograft function was evident. With technical refinements, this procedure should be applicable to most type I diabetics with renal failure.\r"

The tissue response was focal and there was no excessive fibrous tissue or vascular proliferation or any indication of iris neovascularization for six months.

Strong positive correlations were found between numbers of mast cells per cubic millimeter of synovial tissue and the following synovial tissue parameters: inflammatory index (a quantification of lymphocytic infiltration), Leu-3a grade (T helper/inducer lymphocytes), Leu-1 grade (T lymphocyte), and plasma cell grade. A strong negative correlation was found between the synovial mast cell count and the extent of sublining layer fibrin deposition. Correlations between synovial mast cell count and Leu-2a grade, ratio of Leu-3a grade:Leu-2a grade, OKM1 grade, HLA-DR grade, and lining layer thickness grade did not reach statistical significance. In addition, we obtained synovial specimens from 6 of the patients both before and after long-term therapy with oral methotrexate and from 3 of the patients before, and 1 week after, an intraarticular injection of steroid. The 3 patients who had an intraarticular steroid injection showed a 67-96% decrease in the number of synovial tissue mast cells; there was no significant change in the number of synovial mast cells in the tissues of the 6 patients who received oral methotrexate. These observations are the first documentation of a quantitative relationship between the number of mast cells and the number and phenotypic profile of infiltrating lymphocytes in an inflamed tissue, which in this case, is human synovium. Our findings suggest that mast cells are involved in the pathologic interactions in rheumatoid arthritis and might play a role in the early phases of exacerbations of disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of combinations of nonsteroidal drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have yielded conflicting results. We used standard methods to measure disease activity and high pressure liquid chromatography to measure plasma drug concentrations. We used doses of choline magnesium trisalicylate, adjusted to achieve therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, and naproxen in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of full dose trisalicylate (CMT), full dose naproxen (N), full dose of both (CMT-N), and half dose of both (cmt-n) to examine their relative efficacy and toxicity in treating RA. CMT-N was statistically superior to all other treatments in only 1 of 12 efficacy variables, but was equal to N and better than CMT or cmt-n for 7 variables. There were minimal differences among treatments for the other 4 efficacy variables. The mean percentage difference for the efficacy variables between CMT-N and N was 3%, between CMT-N and CMT was 10.6%, and between CMT-N and cmt-n was 10.5%. Thirteen percent of patients manifested toxic reactions during the initial open dose-adjustment salicylate run-in phase. During the double-blind phases of the study, CMT-N was more toxic than N, CMT, or cmt-n (7.5% versus 3.4%, 1.8%, and 3.7%, respectively). Tinnitus was more common when full-dose CMT was used; N (N or CMT-N) was associated with increased skin toxicity. Gastrointestinal complaints were equally common with all regimens. CMT-N, although sometimes statistically superior to CMT, N, or cmt-n, showed no clinically important additive or synergistic effect versus N or CMT alone.\r"

There was a disproportionate reduction in T4+ peripheral lymphocytes when cold-reactive antilymphocyte antibodies preferentially cytotoxic for this subpopulation were present in autologous serum. The decrease in this subset was responsible for a reduction in the T4:T8 ratio; variation in the number and proportion of T8+ cells was insignificant. A similar, but autoantibody-independent, alteration in the T4+ subpopulation was found in patients who were receiving prednisone therapy. A relationship between T cell population abnormalities and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity, per se, was not observed.\r"

Hepatitis caused by halothane now seems to be the only major problem in this regard with these drugs in current practice. The evidence is convincing that this reaction is based initially on biotransformation. Thus decreases in the amount of biotransformation and lessened production of reactive metabolic products would theoretically produce a safer anaesthetic. While not perfect in all circumstances, enflurane and isoflurane come close to achieving the goal of decreased adverse viscerotoxic events.\r"

Local anaesthetics may give rise to adverse reactions by a number of mechanisms. They affect nerve conduction and vasculature at the site of injection: a local effect; but is it unlikely that they ever produce an irreversible noxious effect on nerve fibres. They produce regional effects resulting from nerve conduction blockade; hypotension and respiratory depression by this mechanism are frequently mistaken for pharmacological effects of the agent concerned. They produce focal effects, usually when carried in high concentration via the arterial supply to the brain. They produce systemic effects following absorption or intravenous administration, which are manifested principally in the central nervous system. Ignorance or carelessness are frequently causative factors in serious reactions. Adequate oxygenation is vital in prophylaxis and immediate treatment of systemic toxicity, while resuscitative skill and equipment must always be to hand. Idiosyncrasy or allergy can only rarely be an excuse for adverse reactions to local anaesthesia.\r"

The dermo-epidermal basement membrane was newly synthesized during the first few days following transplantation onto de-epidermized wounds. The analysis of keratins and examination of various keratinocyte membrane antigens by immunofluorescence indicated that full terminal epithelial differentiation was only achieved after in vivo transplantation of the cultured epidermis.

In all cases of DLE and LP it was possible to establish the clinical diagnosis with one or both methods, when in initially negative cases the investigations were repeated on fresh biopsies. In DLE the diagnostic specificity of IF was greater than that of histopathology, and the diagnostic sensitivity of the results of both methods together was greater than that of the two methods separately. In LP the diagnostic specificity of both methods was maximal, but IF showed greater diagnostic sensitivity. These differences were not statistically significant. The most important immunohistochemical feature for diagnosis by IF was the incidence and the morphological pattern of IgG along the epidermal basement membrane. This held true for differentiation between LP and DLE and also between DLE and DLE-like diseases. Combination of the results of IF and histopathology gave the most reliable results in DLE. In LP, IF was more reliable than histopathology.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficiency of serial measurement of symphysis-fundal height (SFH) for the prediction of light-for-gestational age (LGA) infants was compared with that of a single measurement of fetal abdominal circumference (AC) by ultrasound in the third trimester. To make the tests comparable the lower cut-off point of AC was altered until the specificity matched that of SFH. The sensitivity of the AC measurement (83%) was slightly better than that of the SFH measurement (76%) but this difference was not statistically significant. Each test had a false positive rate of about 60% which is comparable with clinical assessment. Screening with both tests and predicting LGA with abnormal results from either test improved the sensitivity to 93% but, as expected, decreased the specificity to 67% and the positive predictive value to 32%. If ultrasound facilities permit both tests should be used otherwise SFH measurements only could screen for LGA with ultrasound back-up for those with low SFH results.\r"

An additional examination was performed at 34 weeks if the fetal weight in the 32nd week was estimated to be less than 95% of the expected mean weight. Light-for-gestational age (LGA) was suspected if the estimated birth-weight was less than 85% of the expected mean birthweight. This applied to 186 uncomplicated pregnancies in which there was no clinical suspicion of poor intrauterine growth. These pregnancies were randomly allocated to a treatment group (AD and estimated weight reported) or to a control group (AD and estimated weight withheld). Induction of labour was significantly more common in the treatment group (41%) than in the control group (15%). No statistically significant difference was found in the use of instrumental vaginal delivery or caesarean section. There was a suggestion of marginal benefit in terms of neonatal morbidity but this was not statistically significant.\r"

The birthweight distribution for each sex at 223 and 258 days gestation was derived from the birthweight-for-gestational age charts based on 3888 newborn infants. The sex-specific intrauterine weight distribution was estimated from ultrasound measurement of the fetal BPD and AD performed on randomly selected fetuses of gestational age 223 and 258 days. The birthweights were lower than the intrauterine weights, especially early in pregnancy and for female infants. Thus, the 10th birthweight centile for girls at day 223 corresponds to the 4th centile of the 'true' intrauterine weight, and the 'true' intrauterine 10th centile corresponds to the 25th centile birthweight at day 223.\r"

Viral replication may have a major initiating role in the production of herpes simplex and herpes zoster induced stromal disease, and steroids may initially be harmful in their treatment. On topical antiviral drugs alone, in patients who never previously had had topical steroids, 14 of 15 cases of herpes simplex induced disciform keratitis responded favourably in an average of 44 days of treatment. This compared with one out of 14 responding if steroids had previously been used, 13 of 14 requiring topical steroids and an average 112 days' treatment. In herpes zoster stromal disease cases 78% had epithelial involvement, 54 of 57 responded to topical antivirals alone without the use of steroids, 2% recurred, and treatment averaged a total of 62 days. If steroids were used alone or in combination with antivirals, there was a 50% recurrence rate and 200 day total treatment duration.\r"

Fifty-nine adult males with moderate to heavy infection with Onchocerca volvulus and with eye involvement were recruited from an area under Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) vector control in Northern Ghana. They were randomly assigned to an eight-day treatment with ivermectin as a single dose of 12 mg on day 1 followed by placebo for the remaining seven days, or DEC, total dose 1.3 g, or placebo, and ophthalmological review was undertaken over a period of one year. DEC acted quickly to eliminate microfilariae from the eye and was associated with reactive ocular changes and in a few cases functional deficit. Ivermectin eliminated microfilariae slowly from the anterior chamber of the eye over a period of six months. The ocular inflammatory reaction was minimal and no functional deficit occurred. It is postulated that the observed slow action of ivermectin on the eye may be attributed in part to its instability to cross the blood-aqueous humour barrier because of its molecular size as a macrocyclic lactone causing microfilariae to leave the eye gradually along a newly created gradient. Ivermectin is an effective microfilaricide with minimal ocular adverse effect and could therefore be suitable for widespread application without strict supervision.\r"

  ".W": "In a phase I/II study, 47 patients (median age, 24 years) with hematologic malignancies (33 patients with acute leukemia not in first remission and 14 patients with other advanced malignant hematologic disorders) were treated with total body irradiation and high doses of etoposide (VP16-213) followed by bone marrow transplantation. At the time of analysis, 21 patients were alive, and 19 of them were in continued complete remission for 101 days to greater than 40 months (median, 12 months). The actuarial disease-free survival rate of the 33 acute leukemia patients is 43% (2 SEM, 18%) and the actuarial relapse rate is 32% (2 SEM, 20%). Five of the 14 patients with the other hematologic malignancies are alive, and four of them continue to be free of disease for 8 to 27 months. Pharmacokinetic studies established a strong correlation between the administered drug doses and their plasma levels and also demonstrated complete drug clearance prior to marrow grafting. An etoposide dose of 60 mg/kg body weight was found to be the maximum tolerated dose. This new preparatory regimen was well tolerated and was not associated with specific acute or long-term regimen-related toxicities. Our data suggest that total body irradiation with high-dose etoposide presents a viable alternative to other preparatory regimens. The role of this novel combination remains to be defined by future prospective randomized trials.\r"

Although GpIIb and GpIIIa are distinct proteins, both GpIIb and GpIIIa are deficient in platelets from individuals with the recessive disorder Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. To gain a better understanding of the genetic basis for GpIIb and GpIIIa synthesis, we studied their synthesis by two human leukemia cell lines, HEL and K562. HEL cells contained complexes of GpIIb and GpIIIa, and K562 cells expressed GpIIIa, but not GpIIb, when stimulated with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). RNA from HEL cells directed the in vitro synthesis of a 110,000-Mr precursor for GpIIb and a 92,000-Mr precursor for GpIIIa, which indicates that the synthesis of GpIIb and GpIIIa by HEL cells is directed by separate mRNAs. In contrast, RNA from PMA-stimulated K562 cells only directed the synthesis of a 92,000-Mr precursor for GpIIIa. The dissociation of GpIIb and GpIIIa synthesis in K562 cells suggests that GpIIb and GpIIIa may be the products of separate genes.\r"

We investigated the ultrastructure of these two types of fibrin as well as that of beta-fibrin prepared from fibrinogen Metz (A alpha 16 Arg----Cys), a homozygous dysfibrinogenemic mutant that does not release FPA. At 14 degrees C and physiologic solvent conditions (0.15 mol/L of NaCl, 0.015 mol/L of Tris buffer pH 7.4), the turbidity (350 nm) of rapidly polymerizing alpha beta-fibrin (thrombin 1 to 2 U/mL) plateaued in less than 6 min and formed a \"coarse\" matrix consisting of anastomosing fiber bundles (mean diameter 92 nm). More slowly polymerizing alpha beta-fibrin (thrombin 0.01 and 0.001 U/mL) surpassed this turbidity after greater than or equal to 60 minutes and concomitantly developed a network of thicker fiber bundles (mean diameters 118 and 186 nm, respectively). Such matrices also contained networks of highly branched, twisting, \"fine\" fibrils (fiber diameters 7 to 30 nm) that are usually characteristic of matrices formed at high ionic strength and pH. Slowly polymerizing beta-fibrin, like slowly polymerizing alpha beta-fibrin, displayed considerable quantities of fine matrix in addition to an underlying thick cable network (mean fiber diameter 135 nm), whereas rapidly polymerizing beta-fibrin monomer was comprised almost exclusively of wide, poorly anastomosed, striated cables (mean diameter 212 nm). Metz beta-fibrin clots were more fragile than those of normal beta-fibrin and were comprised almost entirely of a fine network. Metz fibrin could be induced, however, to form thick fiber bundles (mean diameter 76 nm) in the presence of albumin at a concentration (500 mumol/L) in the physiologic range and resembled a Metz plasma fibrin clot in that regard. The diminished capacity of Metz beta-fibrin to form thick fiber bundles may be due to impaired use or occupancy of a polymerization site exposed by FPB release. Our results indicate that twisting fibrils are an inherent structural feature of all forms of assembling fibrin, and suggest that mature beta-fibrin or alpha beta-fibrin clots develop from networks of thin fibrils that have the ability to coalesce to form thicker fiber bundles.\r"

Using an in situ double layer agar overlay system, we demonstrated that exposure of the stromal cells to 1,100-rad irradiation increased their activities in stimulating colony formation of FDC-P1, an interleukin 3 (IL 3)-responsive cell line. The colony-stimulating activities (CSAs) of the irradiated stroma also stimulated normal marrow cells to form granulocyte-macrophage, megakaryocyte, and mixed lineage colonies. Addition of the lectin pokeweed mitogen to the irradiated stroma increased the level of CSAs. The FDC-P1 CSA of the irradiated stroma was inhibited by antibodies directed against murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not by those against murine IL 3. Stromal-derived CSA for marrow cells was also partially blocked by anti-GM-CSF antibodies, probably reflecting the presence of other CSAs such as CSF-1. This latter growth factor has been found to be present in conditioned media from Dexter stroma, but levels are not increased after irradiation or lectin exposure. Partially purified GM-CSF, like IL 3, stimulated FDC-P1 proliferation and granulocyte, macrophage, and megakaryocyte colony formation. These results indicate that the major terminal differentiating hormone elicited by irradiation or lectin exposure of murine marrow stromal cells is GM-CSF. This growth factor, along with CSF-1, can account for the differentiated progeny produced in this system: macrophages, granulocytes, and megakaryocytes.\r"

The largest peptide observed upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of purified human platelet factor V comigrates with purified human plasma factor V. However, a significant portion of the isolated protein is represented by peptides of lower apparent molecular weight (Mr). These lower Mr species that copurify with platelet factor V have been shown to be platelet factor V components by their immunological cross-reactivity with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to purified human plasma factor V. Platelets isolated from whole blood drawn directly into inhibitors to prevent proteolysis and platelet activation demonstrate the pattern of fragmented platelet factor V. The components of purified platelet factor V demonstrate apparent Mr ranging between 115 K and 330 K and are detectably different from the intermediates and end products observed during the thrombin cleavage of single-chain plasma factor V. Upon treatment with thrombin the platelet factor V components are cleaved and the end products are indistinguishable from those obtained upon thrombin activation of plasma factor V to plasma factor Va. Examination of the components by immunoblotting demonstrates that some of the cleavages which have occurred in the platelet factor V molecule are within the 150-K activation peptide. Bioassay indicates that platelet factor V exists as a procofactor and cleavage by thrombin yields the active cofactor, platelet factor Va. These data suggest that human platelet factor V is stored in the platelet as a partially fragmented procofactor that can be activated by thrombin to yield human platelet factor Va, the active cofactor in the human prothrombinase complex.\r"

The present studies demonstrate that the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also induces CSF-1 transcripts in monocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the detection of CSF-1 RNA in GM-CSF-treated monocytes is associated with synthesis of the CSF-1 gene product. The results thus suggest that GM-CSF may indirectly control specific monocyte functions through the regulation of CSF-1 production. These findings indicate another level of interaction between T cells and monocytes.\r"

Four patients have died, two of relapse at extramedullary sites, one of severe acute GVHD, and one from GI bleeding and pericardial effusion. One patient is alive in relapse and four patients have signs of minimal persistent disease. Five patients are well without signs of active disease. Minor improvement in osteolytic lesions on X-ray were seen in three patients, but the X-ray bone structure was mainly unchanged in most patients. Bone marrow transplantation appears promising for treatment of certain patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

The total and the relative amounts of eicosanoids released were similar to those reported for the rat urinary bladder. These eicosanoids may play a role in modulating the tone and contractility of the bladder as well as affecting cytoprotection of the mucosa. In view of the abundant release of eicosanoids by the bladder, caution must be exercised when considering urinary eicosanoid excretion as reflecting production by the systemic vasculature and/or the kidneys.\r"

Sonography and Doppler analysis were performed before and after the papaverine injection. The anatomy of the penis was easily seen. Flow in the deep arteries was obtained in most patients in both the flaccid and erect state. Patients with a good erectile response to papaverine injection had a larger increase in the inner diameter of the deep cavernosal artery than did those with a poor response. However, the percentage change in the diameter did not correlate with the degree of clinical response. Following injection, the systolic peak flow rates and diastolic minimum flow rates were higher in patients with some clinical response but only the increase in diastolic flow rates correlated in a stepwise fashion with the degree of clinical response. This technique provides a method for the objective assessment of response to intracorporeal papaverine injection. Its potential as a diagnostic test will only be determined after normal values are established. At present it appears most useful in patients responding poorly to papaverine injection by indicating the possible area of vascular impairment and the direction for further evaluation.\r"

Infusion of affinity-purified active human enterokinase in buffer did not cause pancreatitis, presumably because of the inability of the macromolecule to gain access to its specific intracellular substrate trypsinogens. The addition of enterokinase 200 ng to GDOC 34 mmol/l in the infusate resulted in a severe systemic disturbance and a form of acute necrotizing pancreatitis which was uniformly and rapidly lethal. This effect was not seen when equimolar trypsin was substituted for enterokinase. These findings show that enterokinase specifically increases the lethality of experimental bile salt pancreatitis and suggest that this bile-borne enzyme may in some cases pose a significant clinical threat.\r"

This study was undertaken to evaluate both technique and aesthetic results of early excision and split thickness autografting (STAG) of full skin thickness face burns. Twenty-five patients with full skin thickness face burns were operated on between days 4 and 14 post-burn. Thirteen patients had excision and STAG in one stage. Twelve patients had a two-stage procedure-excision and coverage with a biological dressing followed 24-72 h later by STAG. Seven of these patients had a pressure dressing in the form of a silicone face mask applied at the second stage. Early cosmetic results were encouraging in all patients. Twenty-five per cent of patients later required either contracture release or skin resurfacing. Preliminary results are encouraging and warrant evaluation by surgeons at other centres. When early excision of full skin thickness face burns is undertaken, cautious optimism as to the ultimate aesthetic result, both by the surgeon and the patient, is advisable.\r"

The advantages of the early surgical approach are proven by comparing this technique with the 'old' conservative treatment in two different populations. It is clearly concluded that early excision and grafting, combined with adequate physiotherapy and pressure garments, offer favourable results for the burned hand. Early excision of the burn eschar, before the appearance of contamination, may prevent infection, long and unfavourable delay in healing, scar formation with its incapacitating sequellae and a non-aesthetic appearance. Such a delay was characteristic of the 'conservative period', which was dominated by 'fibroblast', 'good granulation tissue', and hypertrophic scarring. Early surgery, as described and advocated here, shortens the healing time, lessens the hospital stay, minimizes reconstructive surgery and leads to a good functioning hand with a reasonable aesthetic appearance, enabling the affected patient to return quickly to work and normal routine life.\r"

First episodes of genital herpes should be treated with oral acyclovir as soon as the diagnosis is considered. Most people with recurrent genital herpes do not require systemic drug therapy. Selected patients with severe or long-lasting recurrences, recurrences associated with long prodromal periods (greater than 12 to 24 hours) or systemic complications such as erythema multiforme and eczema herpeticum may receive measurable benefit from treatment at the onset of symptoms. In most patients frequently recurrent disease can be suppressed with long-term therapy. Since long-term safety beyond 1 year has not been established, suppressive therapy should be stopped at least once per year to reassess the recurrence pattern. Acyclovir has not been adequately tested for safety in pregnancy and should not be prescribed for pregnant women unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Careful attention to disease severity, accurate diagnosis and exclusion of other causes of genital lesions will ensure that the drug is used only when beneficial.\r"

As indicated above, while currently available food extracts can be useful in the evaluation of food hypersensitivity, the results obtained using these reagents are far from optimal. Indeed, in some cases, skin testing after rubbing a small amount of the food on the skin may be more inciteful than using commercially prepared extracts. While this approach may provide physicians with help in terms of diagnosis, purified food components will be necessary to comprehensively study the complex issues of food allergen digestion and absorption; immune response and tolerance to food allergens; and hopefully, treatment and prevention of food hypersensitivity.\r"

Although the wide variations in biologic potency among commercial mold allergenic extracts have been appreciated for decades, only recently have laboratory technologic advances and the production of international reference extracts permitted the development of standardized fungal extracts of defined potency.

To further study this relation, the authors examined the cells that reacted with anti-human IL-1 antibody in biopsy specimens from 140 untreated patients with Hodgkin's disease (72 asymptomatic patients and 68 with B-symptoms). Fever was the most common symptom, present in 57 of the 68 patients. Anti-IL-1 reactive cells were observed in 62 cases. A positive staining reaction was observed in three types of cells: Reed-Sternberg and related (R-S) cells (33 cases); small to medium cells of undetermined origin (18); and granulocytes (11). The staining was negative in 78 cases, including 42 with B-symptoms. The majority of tumors (27/33) with positively stained R-S cells were from asymptomatic patients. Most tumors (14/18) with positively stained small to medium sized cells were from patients with B-symptoms. Large numbers of granulocytes were positively stained in five asymptomatic patients and six with B-symptoms. The immunohistochemical demonstration of IL-1-bearing cells in tumors does not correlate with the manifestation of constitutional symptoms in Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The antibody labeled a variable proportion of tumor cells ranging from 3% to 60%. High numbers of Ki-67-positive cells were found in tumors with high mitotic rates, high nuclear grade, high histologic grade, and in premenopausal women. Tumors with low and intermediate Ki-67 labeling rates often had high estrogen receptor content, whereas tumors with high Ki-67 labeling rates were usually estrogen receptor negative. These correlations are similar to those previously reported for other measurements of cell cycle kinetics such as thymidine labeling index and suggest that immunohistochemical staining of invasive breast carcinoma for the Ki-67 epitope may provide cell cycle information not otherwise readily available to the clinician and may be useful in assessing prognosis in carcinoma of the breast.\r"

The IPX analysis included monoclonal antibodies to keratin (k) and vimentin (v) and a polyclonal antibody to myoglobin. Carcinomatous elements were always keratin positive (K+) and were focally positive for vimentin in six tumors. Homologous stromal sarcoma cells were vimentin positive (V+) and in three tumors were focally K+. Ultrastructurally, the epithelial cells were not highly differentiated and the sarcomatous elements generally resembled normal proliferative-phase stromal cells. The epithelial and stromal elements were separated by a thin basal lamina that only rarely and focally had discontinuities. No transitional cellular forms were identified. A definite positive myoglobin reaction was seen in two of the four neoplasms in which rhabdomyoblasts were identified by light microscopy. Myofilaments were identified by electron microscope in three neoplasms.\r"

Our first case was composed of ganglioneurosarcoma plus rhabdomyosarcoma, the second composed of neuroblastoma plus rhabdomyosarcoma. The name is derived from the suggestion that they arise from pluripotential ectomesenchyme. An English language literature search revealed 11 other cases that arose in soft tissue and had adequate clinicopathologic data. Of the 13 cases, 10 occurred in infants, three occurred in adults, and nine were males. Six patients were alive and free of disease at last follow-up (range, 0.6-12 years; mean, 3.4 years), four patients had died of tumor (within 0.5-3.3 years; mean, 1.3 years), one case had died of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) toxicity, and two cases had been lost to follow-up. Complete surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment and chemotherapy appears to be important.\r"

The HCG-immunoreactive cells were found in 26 carcinomas (52%). Positivity was not detected in any normal mucosa or benign lesions. Cells containing HCG predominated in mucinous (80%) and poorly differentiated carcinomas (92%). No trophoblastic differentiation could be demonstrated in any tumor. Human chorionic gonadotropin was detected more frequently in carcinomas invading the entire bowel wall (67%) than in those confined to the submucosa or muscularis propria (30%). Fifteen of 19 cases (79%) with lymph node and/or hepatic metastases had HCG in the primary tumor, whereas only 9 of 23 cases (32%) without metastases showed HCG immunoreactivity. The eight patients with hepatic metastases had HCG in the primary tumor. Thus, the immunohistochemical detection of HCG in colorectal carcinomas may be a biological marker of prognostic significance.\r"

Blood was sampled for creatine kinase (CK) activity before anaesthesia and on the following morning. When all age groups were combined, there was a significant reduction of muscle movements in patients who had received tubocurarine pretreatment. Serum CK activity rose significantly when saline pretreatment was used in children over the age of one year but not in the infants, despite the presence of muscle movements following succinylcholine administration.\r"

Succinylcholine caused a significant increase in IOP in all groups. However, in the lidocaine group, this increase was significantly less than that observed in the control group. The post-succinylcholine increase in IOP was further aggravated by tracheal intubation in all except the lidocaine group. A further clinical trial with higher doses of lidocaine is suggested to assess its ability to obtund the succinylcholine-induced increase in IOP. Lidocaine in a dose of 1 mg X kg-1 IV prevents the rise in IOP which follows intubation.\r"

We assessed cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity by studying the heart rate response to isoprenaline of the denervated donor heart as compared with the innervated recipient heart in eight patients who underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation and in six patients with orthotopic transplantation. Changes in the donor and recipient hearts seen in these 14 patients were further compared with those seen in 10 normal volunteers. Incremental intravenous infusion of isoprenaline (5, 10, and 15 ng/kg/min) raised heart rate to a greater extent in the donor compared with the recipient hearts in the eight patients who had heterotopic grafts (slopes [beats/min/ng/kg]: donor = +2.26, recipient = +1.59; p less than .01). In addition, the donor hearts of the transplant patients were more sensitive than hearts of the normal volunteers (slopes: donor = +2.26, normal = +0.94; p less than .01). The changes in the two groups of donor hearts were similar (slopes: orthotopic = +2.24, heterotopic = +2.27; NS). The recipient hearts in the patients with heterotopic transplants were more sensitive than the hearts of the normal volunteers (p less than .05), suggesting that the observed differences in isoprenaline sensitivity in the patients with heterotopic grafts were not caused by a decreased sensitivity of the recipient heart. After beta-blockade, the heart rate responses to isoprenaline were attenuated to the same extent in denervated and innervated hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were judged to be at high risk on the basis of (1) ejection fraction less than 40% (n = 60), (2) arrhythmias of Lown class 3 or higher (n = 26), or (3) both (n = 57). Aprindine was chosen because of its long half-life, few side effects, and antiarrhythmic efficacy. Baseline characteristics in the treatment arms did not differ. Holter-detected arrhythmias were reduced in aprindine-treated patients at 3 months (p less than .001) and at 1 year (p less than .001). One patient was lost to follow-up; in the remaining patients 1 year mortality was 20% (28/142; 12 aprindine and 16 placebo). There was no significant difference between the two study arms in overall mortality and sudden death. However, among those who died, median duration of survival was longer in aprindine-treated patients (86 vs 21.5 days) (p = .04). Although antiarrhythmic treatment with aprindine of high-risk patients after myocardial infarction does not affect 1 year survival, mortality appears to be delayed; thus there may be a role for short-term treatment before more definitive therapy such as surgery.\r"

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring revealed a baseline of 616 +/- 431 runs of VT/day on placebo.

A repeat ambulatory electrocardiogram documented long-term suppression of VT in 13 of 14 patients at 1 month (2.1 +/- 1.3 runs VT/day, p less than .01), in 10 of 14 patients at 3 months (2.5 +/- 1.9 runs VT/day, p less than .01), and in nine of 14 patients at 6 months (1.5 +/- 0.8 runs VT/day, p less than .01). Aggravation of arrhythmia or drug failure was seen in four of 18 (22%) patients (new onset of sudden cardiac death, two patients; sustained VT, two patients). Hemodynamic measurements were obtained with the use of right heart catheterization in patients at rest and exercising during the placebo phase and after 60 hr of oral cibenzoline. Group hemodynamic variables, both measured and derived, showed no detrimental effect of cibenzoline. However, in three of 21 patients (mean ejection fraction 21%), cibenzoline was discontinued due to severe depression of left ventricular function. Caution is recommended in the use of cibenzoline in patients with left ventricular ejection fractions of less than 25%.\r"

All were evaluated sequentially with gamma scintigraphy after administration of 150 to 350 muCi of autologous 111In-lymphocytes. Technetium-99m-labeled red blood cells (1 to 3 mCi) were used for correction of radioactivity in the blood pool attributable to circulating labeled lymphocytes. Lymphocyte infiltration was quantified as the ratio of indium in the myocardium of the transplant or native heart compared with that in blood (indium excess, IE). Results were correlated with mechanical and electrical activity of allografts and with histologic findings in sequential biopsy specimens. In untreated dogs (n = 11), IE was 15.5 +/- 7.0 (SD) in transplanted hearts undergoing rejection and 0.4 +/- 1.1 in native hearts on the day before animals were killed (p less than .01). In dogs treated with cyclosporine and prednisone (n = 5), IE was minimal in allografts during the course of immunosuppression (0.8 +/- 0.4) and increased to 22.9 +/- 11.1 after immunosuppression was stopped. Scintigraphic criteria of rejection (IE greater than 2 SD above that in native hearts) correlated with results of biopsies indicative of rejection and appeared before electrophysiologic or mechanical manifestations of dysfunction. Thus infiltration of labeled lymphocytes in allografts, indicative of rejection, is detectable noninvasively by gamma scintigraphy and provides a sensitive approach potentially applicable to clinical monitoring for early detection of rejection and guidance for titration of immunosuppressive measures.\r"

In this study we assessed the interaction of verapamil's direct and indirect actions on electrophysiologic properties of the heart in awake, previously instrumented, unsedated dogs. After administration of intravenous verapamil (0.2 mg/kg), electrophysiologic effects were assessed serially over a 1 hr period in 10 awake dogs before (group 1 studies) and during pharmacologic autonomic blockade (group 2 studies), and in a subset of these dogs (n = 5) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation (group 3 studies). In group 1 dogs, sinus cycle length (SCL) initially shortened after verapamil (postverapamil 379 +/- 50 msec vs baseline of 494 +/- 72 msec, p less than .001) and subsequently gradually prolonged. In groups 2 and 3, transient SCL shortening was absent. SCL prolonged promptly after verapamil, and sinus arrest developed in two of 10 group 2 and two of five group 3 animals. Verapamil exerted a negative dromotropic effect on atrioventricular node conduction in all three experimental groups, as assessed by drug-induced changes in minimum cycle length with sustained 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and measurements of atrioventricular node effective and functional refractory period. However, compared with findings in group 1, this negative dromotropic effect occurred more rapidly and was markedly potentiated in groups 2 and 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Besides these effects, plasmapheresis may induce some modifications to the cellular immunological status, contributing to the restoration of altered immunological function. In immunological renal diseases various parameters may be followed to decide the use of plasmapheresis, and to judge the effect of treatment. They include clinical, functional, and morphological investigations. In patients with lupus nephritis the main indications for plasmapheresis are the presence of impaired renal function and histological signs of activity in renal biopsy. In these patients plasmapheresis is able to modify humoral and cellular immunological abnormalities. Renal function and clinical course may improve in most cases. In patients with arteritis and acute renal failure the response to plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppressive drugs is better than the response to drug therapy alone. In acute renal transplant rejection plasmapheresis may be of value in improving the graft prognosis, when humoral factors are demonstrable in the pathogenesis of graft damage and vascular lesions are present in the kidney.\r"

The ratio of urinary albumin to urinary creatinine (Ualb/Ucreat X 100) was significantly higher in patients with SLE (2.56 +/- 2.71) than in normal controls (0.83 +/- 0.72). A significant decrease of urinary albumin level in response to steroid therapy was demonstrated in 5 patients examined repeatedly before and during steroid treatment. In one patient who had two episodes of exacerbations of the disease the urinary albumin level increased parallel with a worsening of the serological data and the appearance of clinical proteinuria followed. It is concluded that many SLE patients even without clinical renal involvement have pathologic albuminuria and the determination of the urinary albumin level by radioimmunoassay in these patients is useful for the management of the disease.\r"

A living related transplantation was performed after 6 months of hemodialysis. Maintenance immunosuppressive therapy consisted of predonisolone, mizoribine and cyclophosphamide. Graft function remained stable for one and half years after transplantation. Clinical recurrence was heralded by the development of proteinuria. If the serologic activities had been analyzed, the increase in ANA and Anti-DNA titers a few months before the onset of proteinuria might have predicted a possible histopathological recurrence. Fortunately, however, despite the histological and clinical recurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus, her renal allograft has continued to function fairly well.\r"

Finding antigens to both respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and measles virus (MV) in the same osteoclasts of ten patients could not be explained on the basis of any previously known cross-reactivity. Therefore, possible causes for these observations were sought. Monoclonal antibodies to viral proteins of RSV and MV were used to label proteins. Polyclonal antibodies that were monospecific and were produced exclusively in nonhuman species were used to rule out nonspecific reaction with human proteins. Antivimentin antibody was used to test the possibility of cross-reactivity with a cytoskeletal protein, as a second antibody F(ab')2 conjugated to fluorescein was used to rule out nonspecific reactivity with Fc receptors. Electron microscopy was used to evaluate bone cell cultures derived from Paget's bone in comparison with Paget's osteoclasts. Results showed that the pattern of monoclonal viral antibody labeling followed different patterns in different patients. Nonspecific reactivity was ruled out by significant negative and positive controls. Cross-reactivity with vimentin could not account for the positive immunofluorescent results because of an entirely different pattern of fluorescence in the same samples of live and fixed cells after colchemid treatment. It was concluded that specific viral antigens are present in osteoclasts and in cells grown from Paget's bone and that the present data are compatible with the possibility that Paget's disease of bone is a slow virus infection.\r"

  ".W": "It has been slightly over 100 years since Sir James Paget's classic descriptions of \"osteitis deformans\" first appeared. He had described the mid- to late stages of patients with the chronic, debilitating, rare, and polyostotic forms of the disease. It is now known that the milder forms of the disease are quite common particularly in those of Anglo-Saxon ancestry. He believed the condition to be a chronic inflammation of unknown etiology because of its asymmetrical skeletal distribution, chronicity, and the gross appearance of the bones. With regard to the possible etiology of Paget's disease of bone, nothing worthy of note had been discovered until 1974 when viral-like inclusions were reported within the osteoclasts of all Paget's disease patients. In the ensuing decade, a great deal more circumstantial evidence from electron microscopic and immunologic studies supports the view that Paget's disease represents a slow virus infection. This article deals with the possible to probable viral etiology of Paget's disease with respect to its pathogenesis and its potential for eventual eradication. For many years Paget's disease was considered a disease almost exclusively confined to adulthood. Evidence now suggests that \"familial chronic hyperphosphatasemia\" represents the childhood form of Paget's disease.\r"

In the normal hip, the adaptation between the acetabulum and the femoral head is well demonstrated, and there is no apparent interposition of the limbus between the acetabular roof and the cartilaginous head. In the dislocated hip, the protrusion of the acetabular rim is not so clear as that of the normal hip, and the limbus is seen to be interpositioned between the acetabular roof and the cartilaginous head. In severe cases, the acetabular rim is hidden under the shade of the femoral head. Ultrasonography is an effective method of determining the incidence of dislocation and of diagnosing hip subluxation as well as dysplasia and does not have the hazards of x-ray examination.\r"

In two cases of triradiate cartilage injury, one had premature closure of the triradiate cartilage with subsequent acetabular dysplasia requiring acetabular reconstruction. A review of the literature reveals ten other cases of acetabular dysplasia after injury to the triradiate cartilage.

The only immediate postoperative complication was in a single hip patient who had a nonfatal pulmonary embolism. Two patients died from cardiovascular causes; the remaining eight had excellent results from arthroplasty, with an average Harris hip rating of 95 at a mean follow-up period of 34 months. No patient had required revision surgery and radiographic follow-up examination has revealed no evidence of loosening of any of these cemented arthroplasties. One patient developed a late hematogeneous sepsis of one hip seven years after replacement from atypical mycobacterium three months following renal transplantation, which was done 11 years after cardiac transplantation. Total joint arthroplasty has resulted in excellent clinical and radiologic results in this patient population. Despite the increased risks of major surgery in these immunocompromised transplant recipients, total joint arthroplasty appears to be a safe and effective method of treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip.\r"

  ".W": "High rates of bone resorption, bone formation, and marrow fibrosis are characteristic of Paget's disease of bone. This excessive bone turnover is reflected by increased fluxes of calcium ions out of and into the skeleton. The rates of these fluxes are highly geared to each other such that calcium balances are close to zero in the absence of fracture or significant immobilization. An increased turnover of bone matrix is also evident by increased urinary excretion of collagen breakdown products (oligopeptides of hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and hydroxylysine glycosides) as well as products (peptides of higher molecular weight) related to collagen synthesis. Increased circulatory levels of procollagen extension fragments reflect increased synthesis of Type I collagen (bone matrix) and Type III collagen (marrow fibrosis). Increased levels of bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-protein presumably reflect primarily bone matrix synthesis but bone resorption as well. When bone resorption is suppressed pharmacologically, the abnormal levels of these markers of matrix turnover and osteoblastic activity (alkaline phosphatase) also decrease, presumably as a result of coupling of resorption and formation.\r"

Calcitonin and katacalcin come mainly from the thyroid, while CGRP is present in both the thyroid and the central nervous system. Calcitonin is concerned with skeletal integrity, while the function of katacalcin, if any, is unknown. The secretion of calcitonin is, in part, estrogen dependent, and it appears likely that a postmenopausal decline in calcitonin secretion is a factor in the development of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is possible that calcitonin may prove useful in the prevention and perhaps the treatment of this condition. CGRP, conversely, is one of the most potent vasodilators known and probably plays an important physiologic role in the control of vessel tone and blood flow. CGRP may also have a role as neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.\r"

The parenteral route proved more effective, but the nasal and/or rectal routes were devoid of systemic side effects and had minimal local intolerance. The nasal spray was used at 200 units daily in 15 patients with Paget's disease, and at 400 units daily in another nine patients, both trials lasting one year. The two regimens proved active on the parameters of bone turnover and the higher dose was more effective than the lower one. Similarly, a 300 unit suppository was given to another 12 patients. This trial is still being completed at this time. At the third month of therapy, the parameters of bone turnover were significantly depressed. Both new modes of therapy were able to improve the focal bone balance of the osteolytic lesions monitored on sequential roentgenograms. Systemic side effects were absent and local side effects were minimal. Only one patient interrupted the nasal spray therapy, and no one interrupted the suppository therapy.\r"

However, the mode of action on bone resorption is not yet known but is more likely to be cellular. These properties have been used in man to prevent heterotopic calcification, to retard dental calculus, and to slow down bone resorption in conditions such as Paget's disease, tumoral bone disease, and osteoporotic immobilization.\r"

  ".W": "The ultrastructural discovery of microcylindric inclusions in the nuclei and cytoplasm of osteoclasts in tissue affected by Paget's disease of bone has created a new approach. The morphologic similarity of the inclusions to viral structures has stimulated further studies involving immunocytologic techniques and in situ hybridization. Polyclonal antibodies reveal the presence of paramyxovirus antigens and measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus in pagetic osteoclasts. Monoclonal and monospecific polyclonal antibodies demonstrate paramyxovirus antigens of measles virus, simian virus (SV5), and human parainfluenza virus (PF3). In situ hybridization carried out with a 3H-labeled DNA probe, specific for the measles nucleocapsid protein, detects measles virus nucleotide sequences in the nuclei and cytoplasm of pagetic osteoclasts, confirming ultrastructural and immunocytologic findings. Surprisingly, the tritiated probe also hybridizes with a large proportion of mononucleated cells: osteoblasts, osteocytes, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes. This suggests a very wide host cell range for measles virus genomic information which, however, would appear to undergo translation only in osteoclasts. The cause-effect relation between the viral information contained by diseased bone cells and Paget's disease of bone remains to be established.\r"
