He was shown to have a cherry-red, blood-oozing area of vascular dilation with mucosal prominence in the sigmoid colon by endoscopy, but had no other mucocutaneous vascular abnormalities. A family history was noncontributory. Under the clinical diagnosis of angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon, he underwent an elliptical resection of the part, based on the intraoperative endoscopic findings. However, histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a totally different picture from that seen in angiodysplasia: the thin-walled, markedly ectatic, nontortuous veins with hemorrhage were seen only just below the muscularis mucosae, around which the normal ones were shown to coexist. He has had no rebleeding for the past 3 yr. This lesion is considered to be an isolated congenital visceral telangiectasia involving veins.\r"

Within a 1-yr period from 1987 to 1988 in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, there were 198 patients with Dengue fever confirmed. Viral isolation and serological studies indicated that type I Dengue was the cause. There was no evidence of sequential secondary infection among them. The 26 patients were evaluated gastroduodenoscopically. Most of the Dengue patients who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding had gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers; superficial and hemorrhagic gastritis are the other relevant endoscopic findings. Thirteen patients (50%) had a past history of peptic ulcer symptoms, whereas the other 13 did not. Dengue infection is a precipitating factor in inducing peptic ulcer bleeding because of hemostatic derangements. Supportive therapy and blood transfusions alone were adequate treatment, except for one patient who required surgery due to massive bleeding of a duodenal ulcer. No mortality was observed in this study.\r"

EIS had no impact on lower esophageal sphincter pressure. However, a significant decrease in the amplitude of peristaltic waves was observed immediately post-EIS in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus. There was no modification of duration or velocity of progression of peristaltic waves. A four-fold increase in simultaneous contractions was observed early after EIS. These changes were reversible, as assessed by late esophageal testing after EIS. No correlations were demonstrated between esophageal motor parameters and doses of sclerosant. We conclude that sclerosant injection into the esophageal wall acutely impairs esophageal motility, but motor function is partially restored 4 wk after completion of EIS, suggesting that dysmotility is reversible.\r"

The plasma terminal elimination half-life of famotidine was significantly prolonged and famotidine total body clearance was significantly reduced in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, whose creatinine clearance was 57.2 +/- 6.7 ml/min/1.48 m2, but these changes were not significant in patients with chronic hepatitis (creatinine clearance: 109.2 +/- 10.5 ml/min/1.48 m2) or in patients with compensated cirrhosis (creatinine clearance: 72.2 +/- 26.5 ml/min/1.48 m2 in comparison with normal volunteers. The total volume of distribution at steady state was not significantly different between the normal volunteers and the three groups of patients. Famotidine total body clearance showed a weak but significant correlation with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001), serum albumin level (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01), and serum total bilirubin level (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), which suggested that the reduction in clearance was due in part to the concomitant renal impairment, as well as hepatic dysfunction in these patients. In conclusion, famotidine total body clearance was reduced in decompensated cirrhosis, indicating that the dose schedule requires modification in patients with this condition.\r"

Although there were no statistically significant correlations between the change in hepatic venous pressure gradient and changes in circulating plasma volume or in simultaneously determined systemic hemodynamics, a significant negative correlation (r = -0.74, p less than 0.01, n = 12) between the hepatic venous pressure gradient change and the post-treatment plasma aldosterone levels was found. However, in the furosemide group (n = 10), the hepatic venous pressure gradient and circulating plasma volume did not significantly decrease. Our data demonstrated a significant reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient on a chronic administration of spironolactone, which may have been due to volume contractions in patients with cirrhosis and no ascites.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of short-term corticosteroids in resistant ascites complicating schistosomal liver disease after 4 wk or more on standard treatment. Thirty-seven patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Group I (18 patients) was put on 40 mg furosemide and 200 mg spironolactone, in addition to a 15-day, tapering dose of prednisone (15, 10, 5 mg). Group II (19) patients received the same diuretics without steroids, and served as controls. At the end of a 2-wk course of therapy, the mean variations were as follows: body weight in patients in Group I (\"cases\") decreased by 9.8 kg, compared with 4.3 kg in controls; abdominal girth decreased by 7.4 cm in cases, compared with 3.6 cm in controls; urine output increased by 635.9 ml in cases, compared with 364.6 ml in controls; urinary sodium excretion increased by 16.5 mEq/day in cases, compared with 4.1 mEq/day in controls. These differences between cases and controls were found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, there were insignificant differences as regards decrease in blood urea (3.2 g/dl for cases and 2.7 g/dl for controls), decrease in serum creatinine (0.2 mg/dl for both cases and controls), increase in serum albumin (0.3 g/dl in cases and 0.2 g/dl in controls), increase in serum sodium (3.2 mEq/L in cases and 2.7 mEq/L in controls), and increase in serum potassium (0.2 mEq/L in cases and 0.4 mEq/L in controls). We conclude that a short-term course of corticosteroids in conjunction with standard diuretics has proved to be an effective, safe, and economical modality to relieve resistant hepatic ascites. It can be considered a temporary alternative to paracentesis with albumin infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract. The cause of the disease is unknown, and no effective medical treatment exists. In this study, 12 patients received a combination of low-dose prednisone (10 mg/day) and colchicine (0.6 mg bid). Their course was compared with that of a group of concurrent historical controls. At 6 and 12 months, there was significantly more improvement in liver test results over baseline values in patients receiving prednisone and colchicine than in the untreated controls. At 24 months, however, no significant differences in biochemical tests were appreciated between treated and untreated patients. Analysis of serial liver biopsies showed no differences in histologic change in the two groups. During the 2 yr of follow-up, there were two deaths in the control group but none in the treated group. Four untreated patients developed ascites; gastrointestinal bleeding developed in three untreated patients, one of whom developed ascites. In contrast, in the treated group, ascites and bleeding developed in only one patient. We conclude that the combination of colchicine and prednisone does not retard histologic progression or progression of standard liver tests after 2 yr of therapy. There is a trend toward less clinical deterioration and improved survival after 2 yr of treatment. On the basis of these findings, we would not advocate empiric use of these drugs for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but suggest that, if they are to be used at all in PSC, they be evaluated in a controlled clinical trial as treatment for this as yet incurable disease.\r"

Forty-two of the 91 patients (46.2%) with hepatocellular carcinoma had abnormally elevated levels of DCP, whereas only one of the 24 patients with hepatic cirrhosis showed a slight increase. An increase was also observed in some patients with obstructive jaundice. There was no correlation between plasma levels of DCP and those of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma DCP levels normalized after curative surgical resection. Plasma DCP levels were not related to the plasma concentration of vitamin K in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma DCP determination may be useful in the diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The spontaneous rupture of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 10% mortality of HCC patients in Japan. Because this problem occurs much less frequently in western countries, it is often difficult for clinicians practicing in such countries to decide upon the best course of action during the crisis accompanying the spontaneous rupture of a HCC. In an effort to advance the general knowledge of this disease and clarify a selection for its treatment, we review 172 cases of spontaneous rupture of a HCC reported in the Japanese literature. The chief complaint of the patients was sudden epigastralgia or right hypochondriac pain. Abdominal paracentesis was positive in 86% of the patients. Liver failure was the cause of death in 42% of the patients. Therefore, it is important to evaluate liver reserve quickly. In addition, emergency hemostatic procedures must be implemented to avoid hemorrhagic shock. Although two-stage hepatectomy was performed in only 12% of the cases, these had the highest survival rates. Consequently, this is the procedure of choice for the treatment of spontaneous rupture of a HCC.\r"

  ".W": "A modification of Dr. Paul Kraske's approach for removal of mid-rectal lesions has been used in 11 patients from 1977 to 1988 by the senior authors. Patients ranged in age from 56 to 89 yr, with an average of 67 yr. There were seven male and four female patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: villous adenoma (seven), carcinoid (one), recurrent dysplasia in a previous endoscopic polypectomy site (one), positive distal margin for neoplasm following low anterior sigmoid resection (one), and adenocarcinoma in one elderly poor-risk patient. All lesions were in the middle rectum (7-11 cm from the anal verge, average 9 cm). The postoperative stay ranged from 6 to 12 days with a mean of 8 days. The average follow-up for the 11 patients is 3 1/2 yr (1 month to 7 yr), with only one patient having a local recurrent lesion. There was no morbidity or mortality. We conclude that this modification of the Kraske approach offers a good alternative for excision of mid-rectal lesions in terms of technical ease, efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance. The modified Kraske approach is indicated in certain situations and should be a part of the surgeon's armamentarium.\r"

The intestinal biopsy showed light microscopic features compatible with either MAI or Whipple's disease, but electron microscopy confirmed the presence of the Whipple bacillus. Markers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were absent. Although immune abnormalities have been reported in Whipple's disease, this is the first report of opportunistic infections complicating this condition. A useful clinical pearl emerges from this and other cases: AIDS can mimic Whipple's disease; Whipple's disease can mimic AIDS.\r"

Despite the frequency of liver enzyme abnormalities in AIDS patients with a history of P. carinii pneumonia, P. carinii has been observed only rarely in the liver. We present a well-documented case of P. carinii involving the liver in an AIDS patient with P. carinii pneumonia and progressive liver enzyme abnormalities.

  ".W": "Escherichia coli is the most frequent cause of pyelonephritis. Its possible virulence factors include the ability to adhere and colonize the urinary tract, an important initiating factor in all urinary tract infections (UTIs). The importance of P fimbriae in this adhesion is stressed and the evidence for its importance in pyelonephritis is presented in epidemiologic studies of patients, as well as in animal studies. It appears that both host receptor density and the nonsecretor state is responsible for susceptibility to urinary tract infection. Vesicoureteral reflux can be responsible for ascending upper tract infection, but infection with P-fimbriated E coli may lead to ascending pyelonephritis without reflux because of the paralytic effect of lipid A on ureteral peristaltic activity. Renal ischemia leads to renal damage following infection by reperfusion damage due to the release of superoxide. Experimentally, this ischemic damage can be prevented by allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The acute inflammatory response can produce renal damage because of the respiratory burst of phagocytosis, which while killing phagocytosed bacteria also damages renal tubules. An amelioration of the inflammatory response by treatment with superoxide dismutase or corticosteroids has been shown to modulate renal damage. Vaccination with P fimbriae has been shown experimentally to prevent the initiation of the disease. However, since vaccines are not clinically available, the clinical and animal studies on therapy of acute disease are stressed. Acute pyelonephritis during the first 3 years of life more often produced the renal damage that could lead to end-stage renal disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dietary protein restriction have been reported to reduce urinary protein losses in patients with chronic glomerular diseases. We evaluated these two therapies in 12 such patients ingesting a constant metabolic diet containing 1.6 g protein/kg body weight per day. After a steady-state was achieved during a 3-week baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to either enalapril, titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg, or an isocaloric 0.8 g/kg protein diet. Five patients in each group completed 3 additional weeks of observation during the treatment period. Enalapril resulted in an average reduction in urinary protein and albumin losses of 26% and 33%, respectively, without reducing creatinine clearance. Albumin synthesis was unchanged and nitrogen balance increased slightly (+142.8 +/- 85.7 mmol/d [+2.0 +/- 1.2 g/d], P = 0.075). Dietary protein restriction had no consistent effect on proteinuria or albuminuria, whereas albumin synthesis (25.9 +/- 3.4 v 21.5 +/- 2.9 g/d/1.73 m2, P less than 0.05) and nitrogen balance (-135.6 +/- 92.8 mmol/d [-1.9 +/- 1.3 g/d], P = 0.10) decreased. Both therapies resulted in a modest increase in plasma potassium concentration. Whether the maintenance of albumin synthesis in the presence of a reduction in urinary protein losses will convey a long-term advantage to treatment of proteinuric patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Protein-induced increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), termed renal reserve, is said to be abrogated with the onset of renal disease. However, this notion is inconsistent with the results from animal studies which suggest that alterations in protein intake modulate the glomerular hemodynamics in experimental renal disease. Accordingly, 12 normal subjects and 15 patients with renal disease received a protein meal providing 1 g/kg body weight protein. The subjects were pretreated with either placebo or an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. A significant (P less than 0.05) increase in inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance was noted in normal subjects as well as in patients with renal disease. The increase in GFR over basal values in normal subjects (28 +/- 9%), patients with moderate renal failure (20 +/- 13%), and advanced renal failure (21 +/- 14%) was not different. Plasma renin activity was unchanged following protein meal in the placebo studies although it increased following enalapril administration. Enalapril pretreatment did not alter the glomerular vasodilation and hyperfiltration following protein meal. We conclude that protein meal induces glomerular hyperfiltration in renal disease and that this protein-induced hyperfiltration is not mediated by angiotensin II. Because glomerular hyperfiltration is implicated in the progression of renal disease, these data suggest that even in patients who have advanced renal failure, high-protein diets may exert a detrimental effect on the kidney.\r"

Studies were performed in a group of 15 adult male hemodialysis patients. Seven patients were treated with EPO alone at a dose of 2,000 U intravenously (IV) three times a week. An additional group of eight patients was treated with 2,000 U of EPO three times a week and also received 100 mg of nandrolone decanoate intramuscularly (IM) each week. After 12 weeks of therapy, hematocrit values increased slightly in the group receiving EPO alone, from 25.3 +/- 0.8 to 27.4 +/- 1.5. In contrast, EPO in combination with nandrolone decanoate resulted in a greater increase in hematocrit values, from 24.4 +/- 1.4 to 32.9 +/- 1.8 (P less than 0.001). The results show that the groups receiving low-dose EPO alone had a poor erythropoietic response. In contrast, patients receiving androgen in addition to EPO had a significantly greater increase in hematocrit values with treatment. Transfusions were eliminated in both groups of patients. These data show that androgen therapy significantly augments the action of exogenous EPO such that lower doses of EPO are sufficient for an adequate hematopoietic response.\r"

BFR-r was set on each blood pump, and a timed outflow specimen from the dialysis circuit was used to measure the BFR-a delivered. BFR-r values of 200, 350, and 500 mL/min were used; the arterial pressure was set at -50, -250, and -325 mm Hg. BFR was determined every hour for 5 hours. At an arterial pressure of -50 mm Hg, the BFR-a was slightly higher than the BFR-r, and this did not vary over the 5-hour study period. When the arterial pressure was -250 mm Hg, the initial BFR-a was 95% of the BFR-r; at the end of the 5-hour study, this had declined to an average of 87% of the BFR-r.

Plasma AT III, PS, and PC were measured in 20 uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis immediately before, during, and after dialysis treatment. These values were compared with those obtained from 20 matched healthy controls. Plasma PC and total PS antigen levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The plasma AT III antigen level was determined by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Functional activities of PC and AT III were determined by the amidolytic method. Free PS antigen level was quantitated by measuring the free PS-related antigen after the sample was treated with polyethylene glycol to remove the C4b-binding protein. Uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis had a higher total PS antigen level, but a lower free PS antigen level compared with the controls. Both the antigen level and functional activity of AT III in uremic patients were significantly lower than those of controls. Their predialysis plasma PC antigen level and functional activity were not different from those of normal controls. A significant correlation between the antigen level and functional activity of PC, PS, and AT III was demonstrated in healthy controls, but not in hemodialysis patients. No significant change in the level of AT III or PS was observed with hemodialysis, but a progressive increase of functional activity of PC was documented with hemodialysis. Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation between the antigen level and functional activity of PC improved significantly with dialysis treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Most episodes of fungal peritonitis occur during or after a period of antibiotic treatment of various bacterial infections, usually bacterial peritonitis. From April 1979 to December 1982 (period I), 10 episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 415 patient-months, ie, 10.5% of all peritonitis episodes recorded in our CAPD program. After the introduction of oral prophylaxis with 3 x 500,000 IU [corrected] nystatin during every course of antibiotic treatment, only four episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 2,102 patient-months, ie, 3.1% of all peritonitis episodes from January 1983 to March 1989 (period II). This difference between the first and second periods is significant (P less than 0.05). Moreover, none of the four patients who contracted fungal peritonitis in the second period received nystatin prophylaxis. Thus, the simple measure of oral prophylaxis using this nonabsorbable antifungal agent in every case of an antibiotic treatment largely eliminates the risk of fungal peritonitis in patients on CAPD.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a calcium-entry blocker, nicardipine, on intrarenal hemodynamics were studied in essential hypertension. A 4-week study was performed in eight patients with essential hypertension who were given a regular sodium diet in the first and third weeks, and a sodium-restricted diet in the second and fourth weeks. Nicardipine, 60 mg/d, was administered in the third and fourth weeks. The urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) was plotted on the y-axis against the mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the x-axis before and after the administration of nicardipine. Assuming the difference between MAP and the x-intercept of this renal function curve represents the effective filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, the intrarenal hemodynamics such as afferent arteriolar resistance (RA) and efferent arteriolar resistances (RE), glomerular pressure (PG), and gross filtration coefficient (KFG) were calculated. Although the MAP on regular salt diet was lowered from 125 +/- 3 to 109 +/- 2 mm Hg by nicardipine, neither the renal blood flow rate (RBF) (670 +/- 40 mL/min) nor the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (79 +/- 2 mL/min) was altered. The RA was estimated to be reduced from 9,300 +/- 900 to 7,400 +/- 700 dyne.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.01), while no changes were noted in RE (4,900 +/- 400 dyne.s.cm-5), PG (50 +/- 1 mm Hg), or KFG (0.180 +/- 0.041 [mL/s]/mm Hg). Essential hypertension has been characterized by a prominent increase in RA, resulting in maintenance of normal PG. This Ca-entry blocker worked to normalize intrarenal hemodynamics in essential hypertension by dilating afferent arterioles alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to study B-cell activation patterns independent of T-cell regulation in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 67 patients with IgAN, 15 first-degree relatives of patients with familial disease, and 13 normal controls were transformed with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Culture supernatants of these transformed cells were assayed for levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, and results obtained on the three populations were compared. EBV-transformed cells of IgAN patients, as well as the population of first-degree relatives, secreted significantly elevated levels of all three isotypes as compared with the normal controls. However, in comparing ratios of secreted isotypes, it was determined that more IgA relative to IgG and IgM was synthesized by cells of these two populations as compared with the normal controls. Our results imply that (1) the population of B cells susceptible to EBV activation is increased in IgAN patients; (2) this population of \"activatable\" B lymphocytes is polyclonal and not restricted to the IgA class; and (3) even though there may be a primary B-cell abnormality in IgAN, an additional defect(s) is probably operative in the pathogenesis, since cells of clinically unaffected relatives behaved in a pattern similar to that of patients.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics and effect of hemodialysis on the clearance of ganciclovir were evaluated in a patient with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis and pneumonitis requiring dialytic support. A dose of 300 mg ganciclovir (5 mg/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion over a 60-minute period. Blood samples were obtained over the next 10 hours and used to assess plasma ganciclovir concentrations. The patient underwent hemodialysis the following day during which paired arterial and venous blood samples were obtained to determine dialyzer clearance of this antiviral agent. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify ganciclovir plasma concentrations. Ganciclovir levels declined in a monoexponential manner following infusion and prior to dialysis. The patient's peak ganciclovir concentration was markedly elevated (20 micrograms/mL) compared with previously reported peak concentrations in patients with normal renal function. Similarly, the elimination half-life (t1/2) was increased (6.3 hours) in this patient compared with values reported in patients with normal renal function. The volume of distribution (0.21 L/kg) and total body clearance prior to hemodialysis (35.5 mL/min) were diminished in this patient. Hemodialysis reduced ganciclovir levels by approximately 62% with an extraction coefficient of 0.29 resulting in a dialyzer clearance of 48.3 mL/min. This supports supplementation of ganciclovir in patients receiving this antiviral agent when they are undergoing hemodialysis. Additionally, close monitoring of ganciclovir concentrations in patients with abnormal renal function is necessary in order to make appropriate dosage adjustments.\r"

We report four similar episodes of sterile peritonitis in three patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin. The prior report implicated a change in the brand of vancomycin preparation, from Vancocin to Vancoled, as a contributing factor. We noted the occurrence of such episodes following a switch from Vancocin to a generic preparation from Abbott Laboratories. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) profiles of the three preparations show Vancocin to have a lower level of impurities than the other two; the presence of certain contaminants in the other brands may be contributing to the clinical difference observed. We conclude that chemical peritonitis due to IP vancomycin administration does occur, and that increased awareness of this entity could allow other cases to be identified.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To provide information on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in the offspring of the original cohort from the Framingham Heart Study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1972 to 1974, offspring of the original participants in the Framingham Heart Study underwent a baseline examination for standard cardiovascular risk factors. At entry into the study, these offspring were 30 to 59 years old and free of CHD. They were followed for 12 years, during which time 156 of 1,663 men and 55 of 1,714 women developed CHD. RESULTS: In a multivariate proportional hazards model, CHD was significantly associated with age, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and number of cigarettes smoked. Fasting glucose levels and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were highly associated with CHD in men, but borderline in women, while triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significantly associated with CHD after adjustment for HDL-C and glucose. Blood pressure medication was used in half of the hypertensive individuals, and systolic pressure was associated with CHD in women only. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the common CHD risk factors of cigarette smoking and LDL-C, and extends the prognostic role of HDL-C in a middle-aged cohort. The impact of blood pressure, with or without use of hypertensive medications, was reduced in this study, and the data suggest that this attenuation was due to successful treatment.\r"

Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock.

We investigated the nature of pulmonary disease in a patient with serologic evidence of HTLV-1 infection. In this case, endobronchial biopsy specimens showed infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by pleomorphic cells exhibiting a high degree of nuclear irregularity. These cells were morphologically identical in appearance to malignant cells found in peripheral blood and infiltrating the dermis, expressed the OKT4/Leu3 phenotype and the receptor for interleukin 2, and, by analogy to gene rearrangement studies on leukemic blood cells, were monoclonal in origin. However, in situ hybridization of endobronchial biopsy specimens with full-length HTLV-1 probes failed to detect retroviral RNA or proviral DNA. These studies indicate that T lymphocytic involvement of the lower respiratory tract in HTLV-1-associated ATLL is characterized by expression of a malignant phenotype despite the inability to document actual cellular infection with this retrovirus by a molecular hybridization technique.\r"

This study assesses the predictive diagnostic value of furosemide-131I-hippuran renography after angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in patients with and without RVH. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were investigated at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. Twenty-eight patients had RVH and 22 did not. Twenty-eight patients had normal or minimally decreased renal function (serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or less) and 22 had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level 1.8 mg/dL or more). Renography was performed 60 minutes after oral administration of 50 mg captopril or 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 40 micrograms/kg enalaprilat. Forty milligrams of furosemide were administered intravenously 2 minutes after injection of 131I-hippuran. The residual cortical activity (RCA) of 131I-hippuran was measured at 20 minutes. RESULTS: RVH was unlikely when RCA after ACE inhibition was less than 30% of peak cortical activity. Conversely, RVH was present when 131I-hippuran cortical activity steadily increased throughout the test to reach 100% at 20 minutes. In azotemic patients with RCA between 31% and 100%, RVH was differentiated from intrinsic renal disease by obtaining a baseline renogram without ACE inhibition and comparing RCA in that study and RCA after ACE inhibition. If RCA increased (indicating worsening renal function) after ACE inhibition, RVH was likely; whereas, intrinsic renal disease was more likely if RCA remained unchanged or decreased (indicating improved renal function) with ACE inhibition. The test had a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 96% in this population. There was a direct correlation between the results of angioplasty or surgery on high blood pressure and the changes in RCA before and after intervention (n = 20). CONCLUSION: Furosemide-131I-hippuran renography with ACE inhibition is highly predictive in identifying patients with RVH.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and clinical usefulness of renography performed in combination with captopril administration (\"captopril renography\") in diagnosing renal artery stenosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with suspected renal artery stenosis underwent renography prior to performance of renal angiography. Renography was performed on two consecutive days using technetium-99m-diethylenetiamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) as an index of glomerular filtration rate and iodine-131-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) as an index of renal blood flow. Captopril (25 mg orally, crushed) was administered 1 hour before the second study. Renal artery stenosis was defined as a stenosis exceeding 70%. Renographic criteria were then established, retrospectively, to differentiate renal artery stenosis from essential hypertension based on (1) asymmetry of function and (2) the presence of captopril-induced changes. RESULTS: Renal artery stenosis was detected in 35 of 55 patients (21 with unilateral and 14 with bilateral stenosis). Three criteria were established for diagnosing renal artery stenosis: (1) a percent uptake of DTPA by the affected kidney of less than 40% of the combined bilateral uptake, (2) a delayed time to peak uptake of DTPA, which was more than 5 minutes longer in the affected kidney than in the contralateral kidney, (3) a delayed excretion of DTPA, with retention at 15 minutes, as a fraction of peak activity, more than 20% greater than in the contralateral kidney. The presence of one or more of these criteria was diagnostic of renal artery stenosis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 75%, respectively before captopril administration, and 94% and 95% after captopril administration. Lesser degrees of asymmetry (i.e., uptake of 40% to 50%) had very poor diagnostic specificity. Among patients with bilateral stenoses, asymmetry identified the more severely affected kidney, but the presence or absence of stenosis in the contralateral kidney could not be reliably determined. When pre- and post-captopril studies were compared, the presence of captopril-induced scintigraphic changes was a highly specific finding for renal artery stenosis, but occurred in only 51% of the cases. OIH scintigraphy provided similar results, with slightly lower sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Asymmetry of DTPA uptake, time to peak uptake, or retention seen on a single post-captopril renogram is a highly sensitive and specific finding in detecting renal artery stenosis but does not distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. If renograms are obtained both before and after captopril administration, the presence of captopril-induced change is a highly specific finding for the detection of renal artery stenosis, but the sensitivity of this finding is low.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Prostacyclin, a potent inhibitor of platelet function and vasodilator, has been used to treat peripheral vascular disease. The aim of this study was to monitor the thrombotic status of patients treated by infusion of a stable prostacyclin analogue, iloprost. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with peripheral vascular disease underwent iloprost infusion for 3 days (8 hours each day) in a dose ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/kg/minute. Variable parameters of thrombosis such as platelet reactivity (shear-induced hemostatic plug formation and thrombus formation on a collagen fiber), coagulation, and spontaneous thrombolysis (dislodgment of hemostatic plugs) were measured from non-anticoagulated blood samples by hemostatometry immediately before and 1 hour after the infusion and on the last day, 4 hours after initiation of the infusion. RESULTS: Analysis of data from all patients 1 hour after the infusion showed no changes in platelet reactivity and spontaneous thrombolysis, but coagulation was significantly enhanced. In four patients, significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed after the infusion. Four of the five patients tested while undergoing iloprost infusion showed an enhanced thrombotic reaction and markedly enhanced coagulation. Iloprost employed in vitro in a concentration that corresponds to the therapeutic peak blood level caused no inhibition of platelet function but significantly enhanced coagulation. The threshold in vitro iloprost concentration at which anti-platelet effect and increased spontaneous thrombolysis were observed was twice that of the therapeutic blood level. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the view that antagonism of platelet function is an important factor of iloprost therapy. Furthermore, platelet hyperreactivity in some patients and markedly enhanced coagulation during and after infusion of iloprost in general, represent a risk of thromboembolism, especially as patients are already in a prethrombotic condition.\r"

  ".U": "91096831\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine whether elevated serum levels of antibodies to ribosomal P proteins (anti-P antibodies) are associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Additional experiments examined characteristics of these antibodies that might be associated with pathogenicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A large number of serum samples were collected from patients with SLE, control subjects with other rheumatic diseases, and normal individuals. At the time serum samples were obtained, patients with SLE were categorized according to the presence of psychosis, depression, and other manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Serum anti-P antibody activity was quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing a synthetic peptide corresponding to the major P protein epitope. RESULTS: In a group of 79 normal individuals, mean (+/- SE) IgG anti-P activity was 0.01 +/- 0.003 and no individuals had values greater than 3 SD above the mean. Similar results were obtained measuring IgM anti-P activity. Normal levels were found in all sera from 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Of 119 patients demonstrating various patterns of antinuclear and anticytoplasmic antibody activity, elevated anti-P levels were found only in patients with SLE. Overall, 19% of 269 patients with SLE demonstrated elevated levels of IgG or IgM anti-P antibodies, including 14% of 187 patients without and 29% of 82 patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations. The frequency of positive test results varied greatly depending on the nature of the CNS involvement. The frequency in patients with severe depression (n = 8) and psychosis (n = 29) was 88% and 45%, respectively, compared with only 9% in patients with nonpsychiatric neurologic disease (n = 45). For the entire SLE group, the odds ratio for the association of anti-P antibodies and severe psychiatric manifestations was 7.63 with a 95% confidence interval of 3.61 to 16.14. In a review of 187 patients with SLE originally classified as not having severe psychiatric disease, seven of 10 patients being treated with antidepressant medications had elevated levels of anti-P antibodies. In serial studies, the serum level of anti-P antibodies appeared to correlate with the activity of psychiatric disease and did not correlate with the activity of other manifestations of SLE. Anti-P antibodies in nearly all patients were IgG and directed primarily to the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the P protein. No difference in these characteristics was observed when patients with and without psychiatric manifestations were compared. Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were also obtained from eight patients with active neuropsychiatric disease. Even when expressed as a fraction of the total IgG present, anti-P activity was markedly lower in CSF than in serum. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of autoantibodies to the C-terminal region of ribosomal P proteins appear to be a specific marker for SLE, and are associated with both severe depression and psychosis in this disease. This assay is easily reproducible and may help distinguish SLE-induced psychiatric disease from that caused by other processes.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Vasovagally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed to be common, but difficult to diagnose, causes of syncope. Upright tilt-table testing has been proposed as a possible way to test for vasovagal episodes. This study investigated the clinical utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope of unknown origin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and six control subjects were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/minute given intravenously), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Of the 25 patients, there were 14 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 50 +/- 16 years. Six control patients with no history of syncope were also studied. All tilt-positive patients received therapy with either beta-blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine, or hydroflurocortisone, the efficacy of which was evaluated by another tilt-table test. RESULTS: Syncope occurred in six patients (24%) during the baseline tilt and in nine patients (36%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 60%). None of the controls had syncope during the test. All patients who had positive test results eventually became tilt-table-negative by therapy, and over a mean follow-up period of 16 +/- 2 months no further episodes have occurred. CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that upright tilt-table testing combined with isoproterenol infusion is clinically useful in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and the evaluation of pharmacologic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE AND PATIENTS AND METHODS: X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common inherited form of rickets, yet its influence on skeletal mass in adulthood is controversial and incompletely characterized. Accordingly, we measured bone mass at several skeletal sites using histomorphometric and radiographic techniques in 19 adults (four men) with XLH (age range 20 to 66 years). Most subjects had not received medical therapy for XLH since puberty. RESULTS: Eight of 14 subjects who underwent transiliac bone biopsy had an elevated cancellous bone volume (osteoid and calcified bone), and the group's mean value was supranormal (p less than 0.01). Mineralized bone volume, however, was above normal in only three subjects (NS). Another measure of trabecular bone density, vertebral mineral density by computed tomography, was elevated in three of 13 subjects, and the mean value of the group was increased (p = 0.05). Integral spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) was elevated in six of 16 subjects, and the mean was also above normal (p less than 0.01). However, total body calcium, total body BMD (both by DPA), and forearm bone mineral content assessed by single photon absorptiometry (predominantly cortical bone) were normal in almost all subjects, as were the group means for these parameters. Mean regional BMD (by DPA) was below normal in the upper and lower limbs (p less than 0.001) and above normal in the spine (p less than 0.005) and ribs (p less than 0.01). There was no relationship between these indices of bone mass and either biochemical or clinical parameters of disease severity, although men tended to have higher z-scores for axial bone density than premenopausal women whose values, in turn, tended to be higher than those in postmenopausal women (NS). CONCLUSION: We conclude that axial bone mass tends to be increased in adults with XLH, sometimes dramatically so, and this is only partially attributable to hyperosteoidosis. Peripheral bone mass, however, tends to be diminished. Despite these group trends, most adults with untreated XLH have normal indices of bone mass as assessed by a variety of techniques at the commonly used measurement sites. These findings suggest that \"osteoporotic\" fractures are unlikely to develop as a late complication of XLH in adults.\r"

To also evaluate the effect of alcohol withdrawal on metabolic control. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 46 alcohol-consuming patients with NIDDM (NIDDM-B group), 35 non-alcohol-consuming patients with NIDDM (NIDDM group), and 40 normal control subjects. All patients were admitted to the hospital. Carbohydrate and lipid metabolism was assessed in these individuals immediately on admission to the hospital and during the following days. RESULTS: In the NIDDM-B group, blood alcohol (ethyl alcohol) concentration was very low. However, chronic alcohol intake was associated with higher fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations and higher hemoglobin A1c. No significant differences were found in C-peptide levels. Moreover, higher concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate and free fatty acids were observed in the NIDDM-B group than in the NIDDM group. No differences were found in triglyceride concentrations, acid-base patterns, or electrolyte levels. The metabolic effects of alcohol completely waned after 3 days of complete withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Chronic alcohol intake causes deterioration in metabolic control of persons with NIDDM. The effects induced by alcohol are completely reversed after a few days of withdrawal. Strict metabolic assessment is necessary when alcohol is an important constituent of the diet.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients with aggressive primary gastrointestinal lymphoma undergoing the LNH-84 chemotherapy regimen were analyzed to determine the efficacy of intensive combination chemotherapy, the role of surgical debulking in patients treated with combination chemotherapy, and the toxicity associated with each of these modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-one patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma who participated in the prospective multicenter LNH-84 combination chemotherapy trial (total number of patients in trial, 737) were analyzed. These 91 patients included 69 (76%) with diffuse large cell, nine (10%) with diffuse mixed, and seven (8%) with small noncleaved cell lymphoma. Two patients (2%) had stage IE, 54 patients (59%) stage IIE, and 35 patients (38%) stage IV disease; all patients with stage IE, 22 with stage IIE, and 18 with stage IV disease had bulky (greater than or equal to 10 cm) tumors. Specific sites of gastrointestinal involvement included stomach (47%), small bowel (38%), ileocecum (14%), colon (11%), and rectum (7%). Although surgical resection was attempted in 71 patients (78%), only 28 (31%) had complete tumor excision. All patients received three or four cycles of ACVB (defined in text) induction therapy followed by sequential consolidation as previously described. RESULTS: Responses to treatment in the 91 patients included 71 (78%) complete remissions, six (7%) partial remissions, five (5%) nonresponses, and nine (10%) deaths. With a median follow-up of 3 years, 10 patients (14%) have had relapses; predicted 4-year disease-free survival of complete responders is 85% and predicted 4-year survival of the entire group is 62%. In patients with stage IE or IIE disease, the complete response, survival, and disease-free survival rates were similar in those who underwent complete surgical resection or incomplete or no surgical resection prior to the administration of combination chemotherapy. Prognostic factors predicting for survival in the 91 patients with primary gastrointestinal lymphoma were similar to those in the 646 other patients treated with the LNH-84 regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with aggressive gastrointestinal lymphoma treated with intensive chemotherapy have outcomes and prognostic factors comparable to those of patients with similar-stage aggressive lymphoma without primary gastrointestinal involvement. Surgical resection prior to the administration of combination chemotherapy did not influence the complete response rate, survival rate, or disease-free survival rate in this small group of patients.\r"

SETTINGS: Three teaching hospitals where HIV infection is prevalent among patients. SUBJECTS: Internal medicine interns and residents in training in 1988-1989. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, house officers were asked to complete anonymously a questionnaire reviewing their past percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure to blood products. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of the respondents (16 of 86) recalled accidental exposure to HIV-infected blood, and 36% (31 of 86) recalled exposure to blood from patients at high risk for having HIV infection. Of the exposures recalled in the 12 months prior to the survey, 81% (47 of 58) of all needlestick injuries and all (nine of nine) needlestick injuries from HIV-infected blood occurred in postgraduate year 1 or 2 trainees. Only 30% (31 of 103) of the needlestick injuries recalled by subjects were reported. The principal reasons for not reporting were time constraints, perception that the percutaneous injury did not represent a significant exposure, lack of knowledge about the reporting mechanism, and concern about confidentiality and professional discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Medical housestaff are at substantial risk for occupational infection with HIV. A large proportion of internal medicine housestaff recall accidental exposure to blood during medical school and residency, and the majority of exposures were not reported. Hospitals may be able to increase rates of reporting of percutaneous exposures to HIV by developing programs that are easy to access, efficient, and strictly confidential.\r"

Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing.\r"

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development--Diabetes in Early Pregnancy Study, which recruited insulin-dependent diabetic and control women before conception, provided an opportunity to address the relationship between maternal glycemia and percentile birth weight. Data were analyzed from 323 diabetic and 361 control women. Fasting and nonfasting venous plasma glucose were measured on alternate weeks in the first trimester and monthly thereafter. Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured weekly in the first trimester and monthly thereafter. More infants of the diabetic women were at or above the 90th percentile for birth weight than infants of control women (28.5% versus 13.1%, p less than 0.001). Although first-trimester nonfasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were positively correlated with infant birth weight (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.008), when the analyses were adjusted for the variables of the subsequent trimesters the values became insignificant, whereas the third-trimester nonfasting glucose levels adjusted for values in prior trimesters emerged as the stronger predictor of percentile birth weight (p = 0.001). After adjusting for maternal hypertension, smoking, and ponderal index, the above relationships remained. In conclusion, monitoring of nonfasting glucose levels rather than the fasting levels, which are more commonly monitored in clinical practice, are necessary to prevent macrosomia.\r"

Children aged 6 to 13 years of epileptic mothers who used phenobarbital (n = 13), carbamazepine (n = 12), phenobarbital plus carbamazepine (n = 12), or no medication (n = 24) during pregnancy were studied. None of the mothers had seizures during pregnancy. A control group carefully matched for confounding variables was selected of children of nonepileptic mothers (n = 61). Minor and major congenital anomalies appeared to be more related to mother's epilepsy than to maternal medication. There were no neurologic differences between the groups. Exposure to phenobarbital was associated with smaller head circumference. An accompanying negative effect of phenobarbital on cognitive development was suggested. Further research on this intriguing phenomenon seems warranted.\r"

Thirty of 34 patients who had no response or a partial response requested additional therapy, and 20 of these patients treated with adjunctive therapy had a complete response.

  ".W": "To study the effect of maternal indomethacin or nylidrine hydrochloride treatment on the fetus ductus arteriosus and the pulmonary artery, 27 women with threatened preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation were studied by echocardiography. Fourteen women were treated with indomethacin and 13 with nylidrin. Both systolic and diastolic velocities in the ductus increased after administration of indomethacin indicating constriction in nine fetuses, and exceeded the corresponding velocities in the fetuses of the nylidrin group (p = 0.001). However, there were no changes in pulmonary artery flow velocities (p greater than 0.5). In the indomethacin group, there was a significant linear positive relationship between the gestational age and the change in ductal flow velocity. Three of the nine patients with ductal constriction also had tricuspid regurgitation. These findings indicate that indomethacin, not nylidrin, causes transient constriction of the ductus arteriosus and the constrictive response increases with the gestational age. We recommend echocardiographic surveillance of fetal hemodynamics when prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors are used in the treatment of spontaneous preterm labor.\r"

Objective pulse analysis revealed no change in prolactin pulse frequency with serotoninergic stimulation, but maximal serum prolactin peak heights increased significantly. Multiple-parameter deconvolution disclosed no change in prolactin half-life, but a significant increase in the total mass of prolactin secreted per 24 hours during fluoxetine administration. Cosinor analysis of the prolactin time series showed a significant increase in the circadian amplitude and mean without any change in the time of maximal concentration during treatment with fluoxetine. We conclude that short-term activation of the serotoninergic system in the absence of substantial estradiol and opiatergic tone significantly increases the secretion of prolactin in postmenopausal women.\r"

In 24 normal endometrial samples light to moderate (1+ to 2+) staining for HER-2/neu was seen in the glands, and there was no variation in intensity of staining during the menstrual cycle. Among 95 endometrial adenocarcinomas, nine (9%) were found to have heavier staining for HER-2/neu than was seen in normal endometrium (3+). High expression of HER-2/neu was found in 27% of patients with metastatic disease compared with 4% of patients with disease confined to the uterus (p less than 0.005). High HER-2/neu expression also was associated with absence of estrogen receptor (p less than 0.005) and with increased mortality from cancer. Further studies are needed to determine the significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in endometrial cancer.\r"

The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The wide range of resulting risks shows that the decision to offer amniocentesis after a negative scan should be individualized.\r"

Nine patients reported abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, five patients did not have symptoms, and three had acute abdominal emergencies. Transvaginal ultrasonography was superior to transabdominal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of extrauterine pregnancies. The presence of an intrauterine gestation sac in a patient without symptoms should not exclude the diagnosis of a concomitant extrauterine pregnancy until the pelvis is carefully visualized. Early diagnoses of viable ectopic pregnancies before rupture abolishes mortality and morbidity and offers the chance of patient selection for conservative treatment. In two patients the extrauterine gestation sac was treated by transvaginal aspiration and injection of potassium chloride under ultrasonographic guidance. The outcome of the intrauterine pregnancy was favorable regardless of the method of treatment of the ectopic pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "A bilateral oophorectomy at the time of elective hysterectomy is often performed to prevent ovarian cancer. The assumption that endogenous estrogen can be easily replaced with supplemental medication fosters the decision for routine oophorectomy. Published reports on the use of postmenopausal estrogen indicate that compliance is less than perfect. This fact could affect the overall outcome. Decision analysis techniques with Markov cohort modeling were used to evaluate the policy of elective bilateral oophorectomy. Results from studies judged methodologically sound were combined to determine values representing the influence of estrogen on coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fracture. The decision tree also explicitly incorporated patient compliance. When compliance with estrogen therapy is assumed to be perfect, oophorectomy yields longer life expectancy than retaining the ovaries. When actual drug-taking behavior is considered, retaining the ovaries results in longer survival. This analysis highlights the importance of including the effects of patient compliance with treatment recommendations when the impact of a health policy decision such as prophylactic surgery is assessed.\r"

The sodium current was large (maximal inward current 7.2 microA/cm2) and of short duration (decayed within 10 msec). The onset of activation of this current was -40 mV, with peak inward current at -10 mV. Steady-state voltage inactivation of this channel demonstrated half-maximal inactivation at -67 mV, indicating that this channel is largely inactivated at normal resting potentials.\r"

To determine whether cocaine directly augments pregnant uterus contractility, uterine strips from 27-day pregnant New Zealand White rabbits (term, 31 days) were exposed to cocaine alone (30 mumol/L) or cocaine plus epinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) or oxytocin (10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L). Cocaine alone produced no contractions, but increased the epinephrine sensitivity by 51% and the maximal response by 33%. When beta-adrenoceptors were blocked with DL-propranolol (2 mumol/L), the contractile response to epinephrine was increased, and cocaine's effect was blocked. In the presence of the stereoisomer D-propranolol (2 mumol/L) with no beta-adrenergic antagonist activity, the contractile response to epinephrine was unchanged, but the effect of cocaine was still blocked. We conclude that cocaine directly augments the alpha-adrenergic contractile response of the pregnant rabbit uterus by a mechanism that is blocked by the non-beta-adrenergic effects of propranolol.\r"

Previously in the rat model we described therapeutic regression of endometriosis with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist antide. Presently we report the spontaneous and steroid-induced recurrence of endometriosis after withdrawal from antide therapy. Rats with endometriosis received antide or vehicle on days 0 (proestrus), 3, 6, and 9 and were killed on days 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 42 (n = 4 antide-treated and 4 vehicle-treated rats killed per day). Additional antide-treated rats (n = 4 per treatment) received estrogen, progesterone, both estrogen and progesterone, cholesterol, and no steroid on day 9 and were killed on day 12. Antide significantly suppressed endometriotic implant size on days 12, 18, and 24. However, implant size spontaneously returned to pretreatment values by day 30. Administration of steroids on day 9 elicited regrowth of antide-suppressed endometriosis (estrogen plus progesterone greater than estrogen, progesterone, or cholesterol greater than no steroid) by day 12. This resilience of endometriosis offers an explanation for treatment failure and recurrence of the disease in women.\r"

A string was inserted into the exposed section of the umbilical cord and placed around the veins isolating them from the arteries. Doppler flow velocities waveforms were measured by placing a lightweight acoustic bag on the umbilical cord. Placental resistance was increased by tightening the string until retrograde diastolic flow was observed in the umbilical artery. All measurements were obtained within 10 minutes. Heart rate, PO2, PCO2, and pH before umbilical vein compression were 177 +/- 24 beats/min, 16.4 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, 42.5 +/- 4 mm Hg, and 7.3 +/- 0.05, respectively, and 112 +/- 38 beats/min, 5.9 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, 56.6 +/- 7.0 mm Hg, and 7.2 +/- 0.05, respectively, after umbilical vein compression. The patterns of diastolic flow observed after compression were descending aorta, retrograde; aortic arch, retrograde; ascending aorta, bidirectional; cephalic aorta, forward, which were quite different from their respective baseline patterns. It is concluded that the appearance of reverse diastolic flow in the umbilical artery indicates that (1) the lowest vascular resistance in the fetal circulatory network is no longer at the placental but at the cerebral level, and (2) preplacental blood with low oxygen content from the descending aorta and pulmonary artery is being shifted toward the brain.\r"

Instructing the patient at risk for borderline, mild hypertension or chronic hypertension during pregnancy on self-monitoring of blood pressure has advantages. Combined with conventional office measurements, many daily recordings give an accurate picture of an individual's dynamic blood pressure. Lower blood pressures commonly found outside the office are likely attributable to an increased awareness, less anxiety, and attention by the patient to nonpharmacologic factors. Such persons may well avoid antihypertensive therapy or antepartum hospitalization. This information provides a strong incentive to undertake and adhere to an appropriate plan of treatment for those patients whose hypertension is confirmed by blood pressure self-monitoring technique. We consider blood pressure self-measurement to complement other reported monitoring techniques for active patient participation at home or in the work setting. It also permits an early evaluation of blood pressure alterations to rule out preeclampsia, especially in the pregnant patient with chronic essential hypertension.\r"

During placental development some cytotrophoblasts give rise to the chorionic membrane whereas others fuse to form a differentiated syncytium of cells that are responsible for placental protein and steroid hormone production. The mechanisms involved in the differentiation of the trophoblasts are unknown; however, an intermediate stage with a characteristic phenotype has been documented in vivo. We have observed that chemically dissimilar xenobiotic agents induced BeWo choriocarcinoma cells to change their usual cytotrophoblastic phenotype and acquire morphologic and functional characteristics typical of intermediate trophoblast. Incubation of BeWo cell cultures in the presence of 1 mumol/L methotrexate for 48 hours stimulated human chorionic gonadotropin secretion (2.3-fold) and aromatase activity (4.9-fold). Morphologic findings associated with these hormonal changes, including increased nuclear size and cytoplasmic expansion, were also observed. With the use of a computer-interfaced image analyzer, planimetric morphometry of the nuclear area of the cells revealed a 1.8-fold increase after incubation with methotrexate. The effect of forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, was also evaluated by means of this model of cytotrophoblast differentiation. The addition of 10 mumol/L forskolin to BeWo cultures also resulted in dramatic changes in trophoblast cell phenotype. Increases in human chorionic gonadotropin synthesis (7.3-fold), aromatase activity (13.5-fold), and nuclear area (3.0-fold) were induced over those of untreated cells. In addition, increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation (1.7-fold) were afforded by both treatments. These results suggest that biochemical and cytologic changes associated with human trophoblast differentiation can be induced in vitro via activation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway by forskolin and through unknown and apparently independent signals by methotrexate.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to observe the sequential effects of oxygenation, umbilical cord occlusion, and finally cooling on circulating catecholamines and nonshivering thermogenesis in fetal sheep. We studied five fetal sheep at 132 +/- 3 days' gestation. The fetuses were first ventilated with oxygen; PaO2 levels were maintained above 150 mm Hg, and by 60 minutes there was a significant rise in both plasma glycerol and free fatty acid levels. After umbilical cord occlusion there was a peak in plasma catecholamine and triiodothyronine levels but no significant increase in lipolysis. Cooling, by circulating cold water through a coil around the fetus, induced maximum lipolysis and temperature difference between brown fat and body core, when plasma catecholamine levels were falling. During this study the changes in plasma catecholamine levels did not correlate with the onset of nonshivering thermogenesis. Cutaneous cooling, which causes neurally mediated sympathetic stimulation of brown adipose tissue, is the major signal for the initiation of nonshivering thermogenesis and thus neonatal adaptation.\r"

Early fetal donor cells have an advantage because they engraft readily and do not cause graft-versus-host disease. Similarly, the fetus is an ideal recipient of allogeneic fetal cells as it is incapable of rejecting them early in gestation. This review presents the theoretical rationale, recent research advances, and clinical implications for adults with diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's disease; we also describe in utero transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes for the treatment of inherited hematologic and hepatic deficiencies, as well as the use of fetal islet cells and dopamine-producing cells to treat postnatal conditions.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between cesarean delivery and neonatal mortality is presented with information from 292 early neonatal deaths (cases) and 3098 survivors (controls) born in 25 hospitals in Mexico City during the summer of 1984. The overall rate of cesarean delivery was 27%. Variations between health agencies and different social groups were not related to obstetric risk, suggesting that a sizable proportion of the operations were probably unjustified. Babies of normal birth weight (greater than or equal to 2500 gm) delivered by cesarean section were 2.5 times more likely to die in the early neonatal period compared with vaginally delivered babies of the same weight. The excess of mortality could not be explained by the effect of maternal characteristics or complications or by differences in birth weight or gestational age. It is suggested that the conditions under which the operation was performed probably explain the increased risk of early neonatal death. It is likely that poor quality of resuscitation and respiratory care are implicated in the link between \"unnecessary\" cesarean section and early neonatal mortality.\r"

On day 0 baseline ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone levels were obtained at 0, 1/2, 3/4, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 hours after oral contraceptive administration. On day 1 tetracycline 500 mg was given orally every 6 hours while the oral contraceptive was continued. Tetracycline, ethinyl estradiol, and norethindrone levels were determined at the same time intervals as on day 0. Oral contraceptive and tetracycline were continued for up to 10 days, and additional concentrations of ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone, and tetracycline were determined between days 5 and 10. Four additional normal women ingested tetracycline for 5 to 10 days. Tetracycline levels were determined at the time intervals noted above on day 1 and days 5 to 10. No significant decrease in plasma ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone concentration was seen with either short-term (24 hours) or long-term (5 to 10 days) ingestion of tetracycline. Similarly, levels of tetracycline do not significantly decrease with ingestion of a low-dose oral contraceptive.\r"

In 14 of these cases, pulsating blood velocities were recorded in the umbilical vein, which in a normal population had a nonpulsatile blood velocity pattern. The four cases without pulsations in the umbilical vein were found to have intrauterine viral infections. In the last 10 cases examined, the umbilical venous pulsations were found to reflect abnormal central venous pulsations during atrial systole suggesting increased fetal central venous pressure. Right ventricular shortening fraction was significantly decreased in the group with umbilical venous pulsations compared with those without (0.18 versus 0.32, p less than 0.05). All the fetuses without venous pulsations survived, but only four of the 14 with pulsations survived (p less than 0.05). The results suggest that blood velocity recordings in the umbilical and central veins of the fetus can give valuable clinical information with regard to the presence of fetal congestive heart failure and differentiate between this physiologic state and other causes of nonimmune hydrops fetalis. This may have implications for fetal diagnostic work-up and prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships among umbilical artery velocimetry, fetal biophysical profile, and placental inflammation in 44 consecutive patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes were determined. All patients were followed up with daily fetal biophysical profiles and systolic/diastolic ratios. After delivery, placental pathologic examination for histologic evidence of infection (umbilical vasculitis) was performed in all cases according to a standard protocol. The longitudinal trends of fetal biophysical profile scores and systolic/diastolic ratios were analyzed for patients with and without umbilical vasculitis. Analysis of the longitudinal trend during the period of 2 to 7 days before delivery showed that there were no differences of biophysical scores of systolic/diastolic ratios in either group. However, in the last examination, within 24 hours of delivery, patients with umbilical vasculitis had higher systolic/diastolic ratios and lower biophysical profile scores as compared with previous examinations. In addition, the biophysical profile score of the last examination 24 hours before delivery in patients with umbilical vasculitis was found to be significantly lower as compared with patients without umbilical vasculitis (mean +/- SD, 6.6 +/- 2.3 versus 8.2 +/- 2.4, respectively). These data suggest that subclinical stages of infection are associated with biophysical alterations of the fetoplacental unit (i.e., simultaneous decrease in fetal biophysical activities and increase in systolic/diastolic ratios). Daily umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios, in conjunction with biophysical profiles, may be useful to follow up patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes.\r"

Human immunodeficiency-positive status was associated with other parameters: lower age and parity, major frequency of induced abortions, and sexually transmitted diseases. Thus although human immunodeficiency-positive status seems to be a true risk factor in relation to the altered immunologic state, an indirect association cannot be discarded. Such patients should be screened closely for human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer. Among human immunodeficiency-positive women, a more resistant behavior of human papillomavirus-associated lesions was detected (recurrence-persistence of 41.7% versus 12%), a fact that might also be in relation to the immunodepressed status.\r"

The costs for curettage performed today are huge, and approximately only 10% in this group of women will be diagnosed with endometrial cancer. Thus less expansive techniques to obtain endometrial samples have been evaluated, but all of them are invasive. The value of endovaginal ultrasonography for identifying endometrial abnormality in this group of women has not been evaluated until now. This study used endometrial thickness as measured by endovaginal ultrasonography as an indicator of endometrial abnormality. It was demonstrated in 205 women with postmenopausal bleeding that if the endometrium was less than 9 mm thick, no endometrial cancer was found at curettage. The mean endometrial thickness in those women with endometrial cancer was 18.2 +/- 6.2 mm as compared with 3.4 +/- 1.2 mm in those women with atrophic endometrium. If the cutoff limit for endometrial abnormality was 5 mm, the positive predictive value for identifying endometrial abnormality was 87.3%. If this limit had been used in this study, 70% of the curettage procedures could have been avoided.\r"

The mean level of anxiety for the control group was 36, significantly lower than either the precounseling or postcounseling level of the group with low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening results (p less than .05).

Results of all hematologic measurements were abstracted from the prenatal and delivery records of 1706 of the 26,901 women in the cohort. Among women delivered of infants at term, mean hematocrit value was low during the early phase of the second trimester, stable until near term, then reached a maximum at 40 weeks' gestation. The mean hematocrit value of black women was consistently lower than that of Asian, Mexican, and white women. Anemia (hematocrit value less than the tenth percentile for ethnic group and duration of pregnancy) at any time during the second trimester was positively associated with subsequent spontaneous preterm birth (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.8). Compared with white women, the odds ratios for preterm birth were 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 2.4) for black, 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 1.6) for Asian, and 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.5) for Mexican women. Adjustment for second-trimester anemia had minimal influence on the odds ratios. We conclude that anemia during the second trimester was associated with preterm birth. However, it does not account for the large ethnic differences in preterm birth.\r"

A diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made by contributing pathologists on 477 subjects. Agreement between the two groups of pathologists was 97% for primary epithelial ovarian cancer and 89% for primary nonepithelial ovarian malignancies. Agreement on diagnosis of major cellular subtypes of ovarian malignancy ranged between 73% for endometrioid cancer and 100% for clear cell carcinomas. We conclude that the diagnosis of pathologic features of primary ovarian cancer is highly predictable. Nonetheless, diagnosis by histologic type varies sufficiently that a review process should be considered for clinical or investigative decisions involving specific histologic diagnoses of ovarian cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical experience with carcinomas of the uterus and rectum has provided new insights into the surgical anatomy of a lamina, which separates the paravesical space from the pararectal space. It has been proved that each of the lamina consists of the cardinal and lateral ligaments and pelvic splanchnic nerves, descending in the following order. The cardinal and lateral ligaments, as a connective stalk, insert into the lateral walls of the uterus and rectum extending from the inner aspect of the pelvic wall. Clarification of this structural relationship led to the development of a new procedure for the dissection of the cardinal ligament in radical hysterectomy, while still preserving the lateral ligament. This facilitated systematic dissection of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments with posterior manipulation, leading to a reduction in blood loss and to prevention of brisk bleeding from the venous plexuses.\r"

Perchloric acid extract methods were used to further characterize and quantitate phosphorous metabolites in term human placentas by phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The perchloric acid extracts give enhanced resolution of phosphorus signals and allow identification of other phosphorus metabolites including small amounts of phosphocreatine. Emphasis was placed on quantitating adenosine triphosphate levels in the acid extracts with the use of the external reference standard hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene in a coaxial capillary system. Adenosine triphosphate levels measured in this way ranged from 0.404 to 0.709 mumol per gram wet weight. Comparison with an internal standard method with phosphocreatine is also reported. Contribution to the measured high-energy phosphate pool from blood in the highly vascularized tissue was found to be relatively large and could range from 30% to 50% of the total adenosine triphosphate measured.\r"

The mean operating time was 57% longer in group I than in group II (p = 0.001), the intra- and postoperative morbidity of the whole series was negligible, and the anatomic results at abdominal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy performed 2 months postoperatively were similar in the two groups. This study confirms that microscissors are the simplest, fastest, most effective, and least expensive instrument to correct a septate uterus.

Two of these three patients had prolonged bleeding times ante partum and post partum. All three patients subsequently were found to have mild type I von Willebrand disease. Six patients had detectable platelet antibodies. Neonatal thrombocytopenia was found in one term infant of a patient with mild thrombocytopenia and negative platelet antibodies. This study suggests that mild, transient, isolated thrombocytopenia can occur in an otherwise normal pregnancy and its incidence may be lower than previously reported. Extensive testing is not indicated unless there is an associated prolonged bleeding time. The possibility of von Willebrand disease or a qualitative platelet disorder should be considered.\r"

Compared with an earlier recombinant P. vivax CS construct, rPvCS-1, rPvCS-2 has an additional 24 amino acids at the C-terminal, which includes the thrombospondin region of homology and a putative T cell epitope. The rPvCS-3 was generated from a chemically synthesized gene that contained an additional 54 amino acids at the amino terminus and terminates at the same carboxy-terminal amino acid as rPvCS-2. In addition, rPvCS-3 contained only 1 each of the repeat sequences DRADGQPAG and DRAAGQPAG. Both antigens were administered with alum as adjuvant. Neither formulation caused toxic side effects and both recombinant molecules induced high antibody titers. Two monkeys were protected against sporozoite challenge by immunization with rPvCS-2 antigen, while none of the rPvCS-3 immunized animals displayed any degree of protection. While there was no correlation between protection and antibody titer or the in vitro proliferation of lymphocytes in response to the antigens, this is further evidence to support the role of the repeating epitopes in generating protective immunity.\r"

While L. b. panamensis promastigotes from 6-day-old cultures (early stationary phase) were more infective than parasites from any other culture day, L. b. guyanensis and L. b. braziliensis reached maximum infectivity on days 8-10 and day 10 (late stationary phase of growth), respectively. Although maximum infectivity occurred during stationary growth, strict growth phase dependency was not observed. The populations of parasites on these culture days were composed mostly of small, highly motile promastigotes with flagella 2-3 times the length of their cell bodies. These promastigotes resembled the infective forms transmitted by the sand fly vector. A distinct pathological picture characterized the disease caused by the different WHO reference strains for these subspecies in hamsters: L. b. guyanensis developed the most severe lesions, while moderate and inconspicuous lesions were observed when L. b. panamensis and L. b. braziliensis, respectively, constituted the inocula.\r"

In direct comparisons with anti-immunoglobulin conjugate, enzyme-linked protein A gave significantly higher absorbance values for positive sera without a corresponding increase in absorbance values for sera from normal individuals or from patients with other diseases known to cross-react with leishmaniasis. The effect was to increase the distance between positive and negative values, which aided in the interpretation of the results. This also permitted visual distinction between positive sera and negative or weakly reactive sera. The assay was effective using either blood or serum as the source of primary antibody. A further advantage of protein A over anti-Ig conjugate was its ability to detect specific antibody in dog as well as human sera. Finally, we demonstrated the usefulness of the protein A ELISA with a recombinant leishmania antigen, gp63.\r"

Whereas the mean weight of uninfected animals increased progressively over 9 weeks, the mean weight of infected animals plateaued at 4-6 weeks and then decreased progressively until death. Splenic mononuclear cells from control hamsters produced 11.3 +/- 8.3 (SD) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. TNF secretion in infected animals was greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls in 1 of 3 hamsters at 2 weeks post-infection and in 8 of 9 hamsters at weeks 4-8. The mean TNF secreted by infected animals studied at weeks 4-8 was 371 (range 28-800) ng TNF/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.005). Control hamsters produced 7.7 +/- 2.7 pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. At 2 weeks, mononuclear cells from 2 of 3 infected animals secreted amounts of IL-1 greater than the mean +/- 2 SD of controls. All of 8 infected hamsters secreted increased amounts of IL-1 at 4-8 weeks. The mean was 164 (range 17-370) pg IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr (P = 0.002). In comparison to infected animals, mononuclear cells from control hamsters incubated with lipopolysaccharide, 10 micrograms/ml, produced 172.5 ng TNF and 44.6 pg of IL-1/10(6) mononuclear cells/24 hr. The effect of visceral leishmaniasis on food intake was assessed in a separate group of animals housed individually in metabolic cages. Significant reductions in weight and food intake were first observed at 2 and 3 weeks of infection, respectively. By 5 weeks, the food intake of infected animals was 46% that of controls. Syrian hamsters infected with L. donovani provide an excellent model with which to study the mechanism of wasting.\r"

Twelve monthly doses killed a proportion of the adult worms (12% of males and 22% of females), leaving the remainder relatively unaffected and the females slowly resuming embryogenesis. After 8 and 12 doses, a number of female worms had resumed embryogenesis in 1 genital tract only, and in 1 female a total degeneration of 1 ovary was seen. Ivermectin also led to a marked drop in the number of male worms in nodules. No serious adverse reactions occurred and the treatment was well accepted.\r"

The human sera used were from patients with prepatent and patent D. medinensis infections or from patients infected with other nematodes (Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa) or trematodes (Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium), as well as uninfected Nigerian and Puerto Rican normal controls. In the FAST-ELISA, the sera from prepatent and patent dracunculiasis patients gave the highest absorbance values relative to normal human sera. The highest cross-reactivity was observed with onchocerciasis sera; no cross-reactivity was seen with sera from individuals with loiasis or schistosomiasis mansoni or haematobia. By the EITB, sera from dracunculiasis patients specifically recognized a 16 kDa protein (Dm 16) and antibodies to Dm 16 disappeared 2 months after worm extraction. Recognition of Dm 16 occurred from the late prepatent stage. A 17 kDa protein (Dm 17) was also recognized by dracunculiasis sera, but antibodies to Dm 17 disappeared more slowly and were present 1 year after recovery. The 16 kDa and 17 kDa antigens of D. medinensis may be useful in the immunodiagnosis of dracunculiasis.\r"

The pharmacologic effect was assessed by evaluation of the intensity and duration of the motor blockade according to a three-stage scale. Significant prolongation (447 +/- 13 min vs. 130 +/- 7 min, P less than 0.01) with a moderate decrease in the intensity of the motor blockade was observed with lipid solution as compared to the aqueous solution. This effect is attributed to the slow release of the agent from the lipid phase, which actually functions as a drug depot in the cerebrospinal fluid. The proposed method is suggested as an additional approach for the development of drug delivery system intended for prolongation of spinal anesthesia.\r"

Four experimental groups (n = 9 each) were completed.

Animals in groups 3 and 4 were given dexmedetomidine (20 micrograms/kg) or placebo orally, and hemodynamics, arterial blood gas tensions, and plasma norepinephrine concentrations were measured 1 h later with animals in the conscious state, after 30 min of enflurane anesthesia (1.0 MAC), and 2 and 7 min after extubation. Oral administration of dexmedetomidine resulted in sedation with significant decreases in heart rate (76 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 4 beats per min), rate-pressure product (11,500 +/- 650 to 6,100 +/- 600 mmHg. beats per min), cardiac output (2.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.4 l/min), and plasma norepinephrine concentrations (290 +/- 50 to 135 pg/ml). Peak effects occurred within 30 min and lasted approximately 3 h. No reduction in coronary blood flow velocity, decrease in regional contractile function, or respiratory depression was observed. Administration of dexmedetomidine before enflurane anesthesia also was associated with a reduction in heart rate and rate-pressure product, and dexmedetomidine prevented the increase in heart rate (146 +/- 9 vs. 60 +/- 7 beats per min) and arterial pressure (117 +/- 7 vs. 98 +/- 7 mmHg) during emergence from anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The actions of isoflurane and adenosine on left ventricular myocardial perfusion during a total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and concomitant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery were investigated in dogs chronically instrumented for measurement of systemic and coronary hemodynamics, regional myocardial contractile function (via ultrasonic sonomicrometers), and myocardial blood flow (via the radioactive microsphere technique). An Ameroid constrictor was implanted on the left circumflex coronary artery to produce a slowly progressive stenosis that gradually depleted the coronary reserve of the distal vascular bed. The reductions in reserve were evaluated by daily measurement of baseline left circumflex coronary blood flow velocity and the hyperemic response to injection of adenosine. At a stage of moderate or severe left circumflex stenosis development, the left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded via a hydraulic occluder to simulate multivessel coronary artery disease, and control measurements of hemodynamics, regional contractile function, and myocardial blood flow were completed. In separate groups of experiments, either adenosine (0.64 and 1.28 mg/min) or isoflurane (1.6-1.8 and 2.3-2.5%, end-tidal) was administered and measurements remade during steady state hemodynamic conditions. Finally, diastolic aortic pressure and heart rate were adjusted to levels present in the control state during administration of adenosine or isoflurane, and additional measurements were recorded. Isoflurane reduced mean arterial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and the rate of increase of left ventricular pressure at 50 mmHg (positive dP/dt50) without change in heart rate. Administration of isoflurane decreased blood flow in normal, stenotic, and occluded regions; however, when arterial pressure and heart rate were restored to levels present in the conscious state, myocardial perfusion in all regions was maintained at control levels. Ratios of flow between occluded and normal or stenotic zones remained unchanged from the conscious state during a constant aortic pressure and heart rate. Similar results were obtained in dogs with either a moderate or severe left circumflex coronary artery stenosis. In contrast, adenosine produced a dose-related decrease in collateral flow and occluded-to-normal or occluded-to-stenotic zone flow ratio. The results of this investigation indicate that adenosine but not isoflurane redistributes blood flow away from collateral-dependent myocardium to other regions in a chronically instrumented canine model of multivessel coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine was decreased in a dose-dependent manner at end-tidal concentrations of halothane between 0.1 and 0.3%. At end-tidal halothane is greater than 0.3%, and no further reduction of arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine occurred. The plasma concentrations of epinephrine producing four or more premature ventricular contractions in 15 s were 201.3 +/- 34.3, 98.1 +/- 13.9, 60.3 +/- 8.63, 57.9 +/- 12.8, 54.5 +/- 8.61, and 53.9 +/- 4.86 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM), at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of halothane at end-tidal concentrations, respectively. The results suggest that in the presence of etomidate, halothane produces myocardial sensitization to epinephrine at subanesthetic concentrations as low as 0.1%. Increasing halothane to 0.3% produces a further reduction in the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine.\r"

Pre-treatment of swine with a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist has been reported to prevent the pulmonary hypertensive response occasionally seen after protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation. In the current study, a control group of pigs (n = 9) received intravenous heparin (300 IU/kg), followed after 10 min by a neutralizing dose of protamine (3 mg/kg). A treatment group of pigs (n = 11) was treated identically, except that the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist L-670596 (2 mg/kg) was infused intravenously 2 min after the protamine infusion. Hemodynamic and coagulation profiles were monitored during these procedures. Pulmonary hypertension developed and reached a peak within 2 min of protamine administration, often at the same time that L-670596 was administered in the treatment group. There was no statistical difference between control and treatment groups' peak pulmonary arterial pressure and peak pulmonary vascular resistance. However, the interval for return of mean pulmonary artery pressure from peak to baseline values was 11.6 +/- 3.1 versus 5.5 +/- 1.9 min (mean +/- SD) for control and treatment groups, respectively (P less than 0.01). Thromboxane B2 plasma concentrations increased in both groups and were correlated with the pulmonary hypertensive response (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01). Platelet aggregation to collagen was inhibited by the thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (P less than 0.05). Bleeding time was prolonged beyond normal range in 50% of L-670596-treated pigs. All other coagulation tests in both groups returned to baseline after reversal of heparin with protamine and were unaffected by L-670596.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, the effects of halothane on the intracellular free calcium transient were determined in fura-2-loaded myocytes exposed to isoproterenol to explore the mechanisms underlying halothane effects on DADs. Isoproterenol (100 nM) induced DADs and/or undriven action potentials in myocytes stimulated electrically with the use of trains of 10 stimuli delivered at basic drive cycle lengths of 200-1,000 ms. Isoproterenol (100 nM) increased the peak ratio (350/380 nm excitation) of stimulated myocyte calcium transients; furthermore, isoproterenol induced a second spontaneous component in the calcium transients of 62% of treated myocytes (n = 72). Halothane (1.5%, 0.53 mM) significantly decreased the amplitude of isoproterenol-induced DADs (P less than 0.01). Halothane not only reduced the peak ratio of the stimulated calcium transient, but also eliminated the second spontaneous component in myocytes previously exposed to isoproterenol (n = 14). Elevated extracellular calcium concentrations (5 mM) restored the amplitudes of DADs and the second components of the calcium transients in myocytes exposed to isoproterenol and halothane. These data suggest that halothane opposes isoproterenol-induced DADs by altering intracellular calcium stores. The authors' findings do not support a role for DAD-induced triggered activity in the genesis of anesthetic-catecholamine dysrhythmias.\r"

At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral, each constituting 10% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction, the volume, the average CT number, its frequency distribution, and the expected normal value, we computed the lung tissue mass, the excess tissue mass, and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of \"tissue,\" which includes edema, cells, and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However, in patients in the supine position, lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal, suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Volatile anesthetics produce their negative inotropic effect on the heart mainly by interference with calcium homeostasis in the myocardial cell. In order to elucidate the mechanism of the depression, we have evaluated the effect of the volatile anesthetics on the binding of the calcium channel blocker [3H]nitrendipine to purified bovine cardiac sarcolemma. The radioligand binding studies were carried out at 25 degrees C, with increasing concentrations of [3H]nitrendipine (0.01-1 nM), in the presence or absence of unlabeled nitrendipine to determine specific binding, and with or without 1.9% halothane, 2.3% isoflurane, and 4.8% enflurane. Separately, [3H]nitrendipine was measured in the presence of increasing doses of halothane (0.78, 1.33, 1.90, and 2.57%). Kinetic studies of association and dissociation rate were performed with 1.90% halothane and 1 nM [3H]nitrendipine at different time intervals. All three volatile anesthetics produced depression of [3H]nitrendipine binding to the isolated cardiac sarcolemma. Only halothane produced a significant depression in binding, ranging between 59 and 66% (P less than 0.05), depending on the concentration of [3H]nitrendipine used. Isoflurane produced 29-38% depression, and enflurane produced 5-22% depression. Halothane also produced a significant (P less than 0.01) dose-dependent decrease in [3H]nitrendipine-specific binding. The kinetic binding experiments demonstrated that the time course for halothane's effect on association and dissociation of [3H]nitrendipine was 5 min for the half-maximum effect; the maximal reduction in binding capacity was at 15-30 min (P less than 0.05). Scatchard analysis revealed that all three volatile anesthetics produced reduction in the maximal number of binding sites; however, they varied in their effect on binding affinity. Only halothane produced a homogenous increase in the dissociation constant, signifying reduced affinity of the Ca2+ blocker to the channel. We suggest that the volatile anesthetics produce conformational changes in these channels consistent with their ability to depress channel-mediated Ca2+ influx into myocytes.\r"

Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine. With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenous) morphine infusion, the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1,003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%, P less than 0.0002). At the same time, the brain morphine concentration tended to increase, to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h. After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous), recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs. 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS). The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance, which is pharmacodynamic in nature.\r"

The children were randomly assigned to group A (propofol 3 mg.kg-1), B (propofol 5 mg.kg-1), or C (thiopental 5-7 mg.kg-1). A baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during 10 min in children awake, supine with eyes closed and opened, and then from the beginning of induction until 5 min after tracheal intubation. Spontaneous movements were observed in all children in group A but only in 14% in groups B and C. The induction EEG sequences were similar for the three groups: after a mean latency of 12 s, the tracing showed an increase in frequency from 9 to 10 Hz (alpha waves) to more than 14 Hz (beta waves). This transition lasted approximately 2 s, followed by delta waves (2-3 Hz) that continued for 1-2 min. Finally, beta waves reappeared and progressively but incompletely replaced delta waves during the next 5 min. Neither spikes, spike-wave patterns, rhythmic theta waves, nor burst suppressions were observed. Spontaneous movements were recorded on videotape and analyzed after the completion of the study by a neurologist unaware of patient treatment. Videotape analysis of the periinduction period showed spontaneous movements to be dystonic and choreiform with flexion, twisting, or extension movements of all extremities. All movements occurred coincident with the appearance of delta waves on the EEG. Their dystonic nature and the absence of EEG abnormalities suggest a subcortical origin and argue against associated cortical epileptic activity.\r"

In a double-blinded manner, patients received a fentanyl lollipop (20-25 micrograms/kg) and a placebo oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) (n = 20) or a placebo lollipop and an oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) of meperidine (1.5 mg/kg), diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) (n = 20). The patient's vital signs, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), as well as activity and apprehension scores were evaluated and recorded at baseline and at 10-min intervals. The patient's emotional status at the time of parental separation and at induction of anesthesia were also assessed. Side effects and onset of action were observed. After OTFC, onset of sedation was significantly faster than with the oral solution of meperidine, diazepam, and atropine. In both groups there was no significant change in heart rate. Although systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate showed statistically significant decreases, these changes were not clinically significant. The child's emotional status at the time of separation from the parents and during induction was similar in both groups. Side effects with OTFC were more frequent: nose itching occurred in 65%, body itching in 10%, and vomiting in 30%. Two patients (10%) in the OTFC-treated group became hypoxemic (SpO2 less than 90) and required supplemental oxygen. In the group receiving oral meperidine, diazepam, and atropine, 10% had mild facial pruritus and 5% complained of a dry mouth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medetomidine produced a dose-dependent (cumulative doses: 25 and 50 micrograms) sedative effect evaluated by visual analog scale. Also, a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure but not of heart rate was seen after administration of medetomidine. Pain threshold to electric stimulation of the tooth pulp and cutaneous heat pain threshold were uninfluenced by medetomidine. An index of cutaneous thermal sensitivity to innocuous stimuli, the width of the thermoneutral zone, also was uninfluenced by medetomidine. Medetomidine produced a significant attenuation of the affective-motivational component (unpleasantness) of tourniquet-induced ischemic pain, whereas the sensory-discriminative component (pain magnitude estimate) of the ischemic pain was not attenuated. The results suggest that systemic medetomidine alone at subanesthetic but sedative and hypotensive doses does not significantly influence the intensity and thresholds of experimental pain, whereas the affective-motivational component of pain can be attenuated.\r"

Sixteen patients were given a rapid infusion of sufentanil (18.75 micrograms/min) during EEG recording. To quantitate the opioid-induced slowing of the EEG, the authors analyzed its power spectrum and calculated the spectral edge. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax model of the maximal decrease in spectral edge produced by the opioid related spectral edge values to serum concentrations of sufentanil. The resulting data for the pharmacodynamic parameters of sufentanil were compared with fentanyl parameters that were obtained by reanalysis from an identically conducted, previously published study. The half-time of blood-brain equilibration (T1/2Keo) was not statistically different between sufentanil and fentanyl (6.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.7 min, mean +/- SD, respectively). The intrinsic potency of sufentanil, as measured by the serum concentration needed to cause half the maximal EEG slowing (IC50), was 12-fold greater (0.68 +/- 0.31 ng/ml) than that of fentanyl (8.1 +/- 2.2 ng/ml). The second part of the study verified the hypothesis that administration of equipotent bolus doses would produce equal onset times. Bolus injections of either 125 micrograms of sufentanil or 1,250 micrograms of fentanyl were given during EEG recording. The time from injection to 50% maximal EEG slowing (T50) was calculated for each patient. The values for T50 for the two groups did not differ. The authors conclude that fentanyl and sufentanil have similar pharmacodynamic profiles, the former being 12 times more potent than the latter.\r"

Eighteen patients showed decreases in ShvO2 to less than 30% at skin incision, at temporary cessation of hepatic inflow, and/or at surgical manipulation of the liver. Clinical HV catheterization was easy to accomplish and may be a valuable technique in studying the extent and significance of hepatic ischemia during liver surgery.\r"

Selecting one of these opioid analgesics as an adjunct to general anesthesia requires appreciation of the relationship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of these drugs and the onset of and recovery from drug effect. Using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model, the authors simulated the decrease in plasma fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil concentration after intravenous administration by either bolus injection, brief infusion, or prolonged infusion. The percentage change in concentration, rather than absolute concentration, was simulated to permit comparison of the relative opioid concentration independently of drug potency. These computer simulations quantified the relationship between infusion duration and the time required for recovery after termination of the infusion. The analysis suggests that alfentanil is best used for operations longer than 6-8 h when a rapid decrease in effect site (i.e., biophase) opioid concentration is desired after discontinuation of the infusion. Alfentanil may also be the most appropriate drug to provide a transient peak effect after a single bolus. Although sufentanil has longer distribution and elimination half-lives than alfentanil, recovery from sufentanil infusions may be more rapid than recovery from alfentanil infusions for operations shorter than 6-8 h. These computer simulations demonstrate that simply comparing pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., half-lives) of different drugs will not predict the relative rates of decrease in effect site concentrations after either an intravenous bolus or a continuous infusion.\r"

  ".W": "The current study evaluated the effects of tetanic stimulation on neuromuscular responses to serial train-of-four (TOF) and double-burst stimulation (DBS). For TOF monitoring (n = 13), a degree of neuromuscular blockade was achieved with an intravenous vecuronium infusion such that the ratio of fourth twitch (T4) to first twitch (T1), T4/T1, was stable at a value between 0.1 and 0.7. Four seconds after a 5-s, 50-Hz tetanic stimulus was delivered, TOF monitoring was resumed at 10-s intervals. Significant changes were noted for T1, T4, and T4/T1, with median increases of 38, 250, and 93%, respectively. The median times for T1, T4, and T4/T1 to return to within 10% of their pretetanic (baseline) values were 34, 43, and 34 s, respectively (P = nonsignificant [NS] among times to recovery). A 100-Hz tetanic stimulus induced 50, 300, and 178% median increases of T1, T4, and T4/T1, while corresponding values for recovery times were 53, 73, and 54 s. For DBS monitoring (n = 14), tetanic stimulation (50-Hz, 5-s) induced 38, 300, and 153% median increases of the DBS3,3 parameters (first response [D1], second response [D2], and their ratio [D2 not equal to D1], respectively). The posttetanic effects on D1, D2, and D2/D1 persisted for 43, 66, and 46 s, respectively. For DBS3,2, median posttetanic (50-Hz, 5-s) increases were 41, 275, and 176%, while corresponding times to recovery were 43, 43, and 43 s. Although the data indicate that the posttetanic percent increase was at least 10 times larger at greater degrees of blockade (T4/T1 = 0.1) than at lesser degrees (T4/T1 = 0.7), all T4/T1 and D2/D1 ratios returned to within 10% of baseline in 125 s or less after 5-s tetanic stimulation.\r"

Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by continuous thermodilution. Arterial and coronary sinus blood were analyzed for oxygen and lactate contents. The determinants of LV performance were obtained from the cardiac output measured by thermodilution and from left heart catheterization data. To reverse flunitrazepam-induced sedation, patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or flumazenil (by increment, up to 1 mg) at the end of procedure. In the placebo group, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed. In the flumazenil group, heart rate, cardiac index, maximum velocity of shortening, and relaxation time constant were not significantly altered. By contrast, mean aortic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure (baselines: 90 +/- 5 and 7.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg, respectively) increased (9%, P less than 0.05 and 67%, P less than 0.05, respectively) after flumazenil administration, but these changes represented mainly a return toward presedation values. MVO2 and coronary resistance were not significantly altered, whereas CSBF increased slightly (baseline: 119 +/- 20 ml/min; increase 10%, P less than 0.05). No electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia was observed during the study. These data show that reversal of benzodiazepine effects with flumazenil is not associated with a major alteration of LV systolic function, relaxation, or coronary hemodynamics in patients with coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, it should be cautiously used when LV end-diastolic pressure is increased at the time of its administration.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether administration of magnesium sulfate decreased maternal blood pressure during epidural anesthesia in gravid ewes. Twenty-two experiments were performed in 11 chronically instrumented animals between 0.8 and 0.9 of timed gestation. The experimental sequence included: 1) T = 0: magnesium sulfate 4 g intravenously over 5 min followed by an infusion of magnesium sulfate at 4 g/h, or normal saline iv followed by an infusion of normal saline alone; 2) T = 135 min: 500 ml normal saline intravenously over 12 min; and 3) T = 150 min: epidural administration of 2% lidocaine. The initial bolus of magnesium sulfate slightly decreased maternal mean arterial pressure (MAP) but increased uterine artery blood flow (UBF). The increase in UBF was accompanied by an increase in fetal PaO2 at 145 min in the magnesium sulfate group but not in the control group. At 165 min (i.e., 15 min after the epidural injection of lidocaine), epidural lidocaine resulted in a median sensory level of T-10 in the magnesium sulfate group and T-11 in the control group. During epidural anesthesia, maternal MAP was lower (P = 0.001) in the magnesium sulfate group than in the control group. At 165 min, maternal MAP was 18 +/- 3% below baseline (P = 0.0001) in the magnesium sulfate group but did not differ significantly from baseline in the control group. Maternal cardiac output and UBF did not differ from baseline after epidural injection of lidocaine in either group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current study compared the effects of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane on resting membrane potential and conductance of hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro. At 1 MAC, halothane produced significant (P less than 0.01) hyperpolarization (-2.8 +/- 1.3 mV, mean +/- SD) accompanied by a conductance increase (6.2 +/- 2.7%). Enflurane also produced a significant (P less than 0.001) hyperpolarization (-3.15 +/- 1.2 mV); however, this was accompanied by a conductance decrease (-4.5 +/- 1.5%). Isoflurane produced variable effects. Anesthetic-induced hyperpolarization was maximal in neurons with more negative initial resting potentials and was reduced by depolarization. Across agents, these relatively small changes in resting potential were not correlated with decreases in excitability as measured by synaptically evoked population spike depression. The results are not consistent with a common action of the three agents on a single ionic channel.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that bupivacaine administered directly into the central nervous system (CNS) is capable of producing signs of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity. To investigate the mechanisms by which bupivacaine may act within the CNS to produce cardiovascular toxicity, we studied four groups of halothane-anesthetized rabbits in which infusion of intracerebroventricular (icv) bupivacaine or intravenous (iv) phenylephrine resulted in dysrhythmias and hypertension. In group 1 (n = 5), icv bupivacaine (500 +/- 79 micrograms [mean +/- SEM]) produced dysrhythmias lasting 73 +/- 13 min, whereas icv saline caused no dysrhythmias or hypertension. In group 2 (n = 9), icv bupivacaine-induced hypertension and dysrhythmias were abolished by icv midazolam in 4.4 +/- 0.6 min, and when dysrhythmias and hypertension recurred (22 +/- 0.9 min), hexamethonium (10 mg/kg iv) promptly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension (14 +/- 1 s). In group 3 (n = 10), icv bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by increasing the inspired halothane concentration from 0.8 to 1.6%. In group 4 (n = 6), iv phenylephrine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by icv midazolam. These results suggest that icv bupivacaine produces dysrhythmias and hypertension by increasing autonomic nervous system (ANS) outflow from the brain stem. The finding that peripheral autonomic blockade by hexamethonium rapidly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension supports this mechanism. We speculate that icv bupivacaine produces an increase in autonomic outflow by blockade of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that are known to be the principal tonic inhibitors of the ANS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two-dimensional echocardiographic and pulsed-wave Doppler signals of the pulmonary artery and mitral valve flow velocity were obtained simultaneously with thermodilution measurements of cardiac output. Cardiac output derived from pulsed Doppler imaging of pulmonary artery systolic flow velocity modestly correlated with the thermodilution-derived cardiac output (r = 0.65), but output determined from the mitral valve diastolic flow velocity did not (r = 0.24). Transesophageal echocardiography of pulmonary artery systolic flow satisfactorily detected intraoperative increases in cardiac output greater than 15% (sensitivity, 71%; specificity, 82%) but not decreases (sensitivity, 54%; specificity, 90%). Although this technique identifies increases in cardiac output greater than 15%, it does not detect decreases as accurately as those detected by thermodilution measurements. At this time, therefore, transesophageal Doppler echocardiography has significant limitations as an off-line monitor of cardiac output.\r"

Brain sections were exposed to x-ray film and their images digitized, and specific cortical [3H]-Ro-15-1788 binding was determined. A Scatchard plot of specific cortical binding was constructed, and the dissociation constant (KD) and maximum bound ligand per milligram tissue (Bmax) were determined for each experimental group. In the in vivo trials, rats were anesthetized with 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane; 0.5 microCi/g [3H]-Ro-15-1788 was given intravenously, and the animals were killed 15 min later. Seven standardized sagittal brain sections were examined from autoradiographs.

A third experimental trial analyzed the timed arterial blood history of [3H]-Ro-15-1788 in animals prepared exactly as in the in vivo study. The [3H]-Ro-15-1788 blood clearance over 20 min and plasma [3H]-Ro-15-1788 levels at 15 min after injection of isotope were evaluated.

In all patients, the dose of methacholine causing an FEV1 fall of 15% (PD15) was determined at baseline, 24 h before allergen challenge. Methacholine bronchial challenge was repeated 1 h before BAL-BL in patients of both groups and again 12 to 14 h after BAL-BL in Group A and 24 h after BAL-BL in Group B. In patients of Group A, the values of methacholine PD15 after BAL-BL were not significantly different from those determined before BAL-BL. This was also the case in patients in whom bronchial responsiveness was increased after allergen challenge. In patients of Group B, methacholine PD15 was significantly decreased after allergen challenge, and this decrease was correlated with the occurrence and the severity of the late asthmatic reaction. Even in patients who showed dual asthmatic reactions and an increased responsiveness after allergen challenge, methacholine PD15 was not further decreased after BAL-BL. These data support the safety of a procedure combining bronchial allergen challenge with BAL-BL, which can be used for studies on the pathophysiology of bronchial asthma.\r"

Long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroids is known to reduce airway hypersensitivity in asthmatic patients. To investigate whether these drugs also reduce the maximal degree of airway narrowing we studied the effects of inhaled budesonide on the maximal response plateau of the dose-response curve to inhaled methacholine in mildly asthmatic patients in whom a raised plateau could be measured. Sixteen atopic patients with mild asthma were placed randomly into two parallel treatment groups to receive double-blindly either budesonide (400 micrograms twice daily) or placebo, inhaled via a Turbuhaler, for 4 wk. Before treatment, after 2 and 4 wk of treatment, and after 2 and 4 wk of wash-out, complete dose-response curves to methacholine were obtained using a standardized 2-min tidal breathing method. The response was measured by FEV1, expressed in % fall from baseline. A plateau on the log dose-response curve was considered if three or more data points fell within a 5% response range. The maximal response was obtained by averaging the values on the plateau (MFEV1), and the sensitivity was calculated from the provocative concentration of methacholine, causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). After 4 wk of budesonide treatment, mean MFEV1 decreased from 41.6 to 33.7% fall (p = 0.0004). The changes in MFEV1 were significantly different between placebo and budesonide (p = 0.03). The geometric mean PC20 increased from 3.4 to 6.3 mg/ml (p = 0.02), but the changes in PC20 were not different between the two groups (p = 0.23).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thromboxane A2 is a potent bronchial smooth muscle spasmogen in vitro, and it has been implicated in airway inflammation and in the genesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma. We have examined the urinary excretion of a variety of products derived from thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2, 2,3-dinor, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2) and prostacyclin (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in patients admitted acutely to hospital with severe asthma and in atopic volunteers after bronchial antigen challenge. Urinary excretion of all thromboxane-derived products was markedly increased in a number of patients with severe acute asthma compared with that in a nonsmoking control population, in some cases approaching those previously described in myocardial infarction: TXB2, 31.6 +/- 12.0 versus 6.5 +/- 0.9; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 79.0 +/- 19.2 versus 29.5 +/- 2.7; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 234.3 +/- 65.3 versus 25.0 +/- 2.1 ng/mmol creatinine (p less than 0.001). Urinary prostacyclin-derived products were also significantly raised in acute asthma. In contrast, after inhaled allergen challenge in atopic volunteers, which caused significant bronchoconstriction, urinary excretion of thromboxane-derived products was not significantly elevated: TXB2, 5.6 +/- 1.1 versus 5.7 +/- 1.0; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 41.2 +/- 12.5 versus 28.5 +/- 6.9; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 69.8 +/- 17.6 versus 39.7 +/- 11.2 ng/mmol creatinine. In a separate experiment, less than 2% of exogenously administered TXB2 to the airway appeared as urinary thromboxane-derived products, suggesting that production of greater than or equal to 1 microgram of TXA2 in vivo would be required to increase urinary thromboxane excretion twofold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lungs were rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen and fixed in Carnoy's solution. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron. At the time of the LR (382 +/- 39 min after OA challenge), RL increased from the baseline value (0.067 +/- 0.034 cm H2O.ml-1.s) by 0.107 +/- 0.03 cm H2O.ml-1.s (p less than 0.05). RL did not change significantly in the control rats. The lumen size and the wall area of all membranous airways were measured and were corrected for airway size by dividing by the basement membrane length squared (BM2). There was no increase in airway wall area in OA-challenged animals. However, the lumen of large airways (BM: 2.0 to 2.99 mm) was significantly less for the OA-challenged animals (0.039 +/- 0.0055 mm2) than for the control animals (0.058 +/- 0.0063 mm2; p less than 0.05). In six additional rats, the distribution of mast cells (MC) in the bronchial tree was determined. Tissues were fixed with Carnoy's solution and stained with a modified May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. There were significantly more MC in the large airways than in medial or small airways. We conclude that smooth muscle constriction of large airways and not airway wall edema accounts for the LR in the rat. The distribution of the mast cells corresponds closely to the site of bronchoconstriction.\r"

The muscular pulmonary arteries adjacent to occluded and inflamed bronchioles did not have the morphologic features of chronic hypoxia, as shown by the normal medial and intimal thickness, but they had an important inflammatory process in their walls that was particularly marked at sites adjacent to airways. Although the functional significance of these findings is unknown, they may be responsible in part for the gas exchange abnormalities observed in acute severe asthma.\r"

The bronchioles in representative histologic sections were evaluated for inflammation and epithelial metaplasia as well as for fibrosis and muscular hypertrophy. Postmortem interviews with next of kin established a history of cigarette smoking and excluded possible occupational exposures to toxic or particulate inhalants. Emphysematous changes were not prominent in members of the study group, but they tended to be more severe in smokers (p = 0.059) and increased in severity with age (p less than 0.001). Inflammatory changes (so-called smoker's bronchiolitis) were evident in smokers of all ages, although they were significantly less prominent in the lungs of older smokers. On the other hand, respiratory and membranous bronchiolar wall fibrosis was increasingly evident in older smokers (p less than 0.05). Muscular hypertrophy in the bronchiolar walls was significantly greater in smokers, but a change with age was not observed. These findings strongly suggest that bronchiolar fibrosis is associated with chronic cigarette use. These lesions occur independently of emphysema and may account for some of the subtle physiologic alterations observed in smokers.\r"

Mean EVD was elevated in the patients with CHF, ARDS, and pneumonia in regions of radiographic infiltrate compared with values from normal subjects (p less than 0.05), but it was not significantly different among the three patient groups. PTCER in normal subjects and in patients with CHF was not significantly different (21 +/- 11 versus 44 +/- 16 x 10(-4) min-1, respectively, p = NS). PTCER was elevated in regions of infiltrate because of either pneumonia (173 +/- 99) or ARDS (170 +/- 79). PTCER was also elevated in regions contralateral to those with focal infiltrate during pneumonia, even though these regions were radiographically normal and had normal EVD values. These results suggest that PTCER is a sensitive but nonspecific index of abnormal pulmonary vascular permeability, which may be useful for classifying patients in clinical studies of pulmonary edema.\r"

  ".W": "Current knowledge of alveolar pathophysiology during early sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the role of resident alveolar macrophages (AM) in mediating alveolar inflammatory events during sepsis is limited. Further, the effects of ibuprofen pretreatment upon alveolar pathophysiology and AM function during early sepsis-induced ALI is unclear. Utilizing repetitive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in a porcine model of sepsis-induced ALI, we studied changes in alveolar cellular constituents, BAL protein content and molecular composition, and AM superoxide anion (O2-.) generation during early sepsis. The neutrophil percentage of recovered alveolar cells (17 +/- 8%, t = 300 min versus 2 +/- 1%, t = 0; p = 0.06) and the bronchoalveolar lavage total protein content (493 +/- 110 micrograms/ml, t = 300 min versus 109 +/- 18 micrograms/ml, t = 0; p less than 0.05) increased in septic animals. Increases in BAL fluid total protein were primarily due to low-molecular-weight plasma protein, indicating relative preservation of alveolar-capillary membrane size selectivity. Alveolar macrophages harvested following 300 min of sepsis generated significantly less O2-. following phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation compared to AM harvested at baseline. Ibuprofen pretreatment of septic animals completely blocked leakage of plasma proteins into the alveoli and attenuated neutrophil migration but did not prevent downregulation of AM O2-. generation. Increased alveolar-capillary membrane permeability, neutrophil migration into the alveoli, and downregulation of AM oxidant generation occur within hours of the onset of sepsis. Ibuprofen pretreatment significantly attenuates early sepsis-induced ALI without altering sepsis-induced AM dysfunction.\r"

The lungs were fixed by bronchial and pulmonary artery perfusion with glutaraldehyde under three experimental conditions: (1) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg pulmonary artery pressure, 20 mm Hg (control); (2) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pulmonary hypertension, PH); (3) bronchial artery pressure, 100 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure, 40 mm Hg (pharmacologic vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside, PH + V). Venous pressures were atmospheric. Under control conditions, the microvascular volume fraction comprised 12, 16, and 15% of the subepithelial tissue in the trachea and 1-mm and 0.5-mm bronchioles, respectively. PH increased the microvascular volume fraction in the bronchioles (p less than 0.05), but it had no effect on the microvasculature in the trachea. PH + V approximately doubled the microvascular volume fraction in the trachea and the bronchioles. PH increased the mean wall thickness, and PH and PH + V decreased the airway cross-sectional area in the 1-mm bronchioles. These observations demonstrate that the microvasculature constitutes a considerable volume fraction of the subepithelial airway tissue and that vascular congestion can narrow the bronchiolar lumen.\r"

When the patients were divided into two groups according to whether they had or did not have mucous hypersecretion, 11 patients with hypersecretion (Group A) had a poorer survival rate (6 yr) than did 14 patients without hypersecretion (Group B) (10 yr) (p less than 0.01). Further, there was a significant negative correlation between sputum volume and the duration of survival in 25 patients (r = -0.55, p less than 0.01). Before glucocorticoid treatment, we also found significantly larger numbers of neutrophils (17%) and eosinophils (5%) in differential cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in Group A than in Group B (neutrophils, 1%; eosinophils, 0.6%) (p less than 0.05 each). Chest radiographic findings and other laboratory data including pulmonary function tests did not correlate with the survival rate. These findings suggest that mucous hypersecretion as well as neutrophils and eosinophils in BALF are among the determinants of prognosis in patients with chronic IPF.\r"

  ".W": "The major mechanism whereby positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) decreases cardiac output is believed to be a decrease in the pressure gradient for venous return. However, although PEEP increases right atrial pressure (PRA), It may also elevate mean systemic pressure (PMS), the static circulatory filling pressure that is the upstream pressure for venous return. In an intact canine preparation, we studied the effects of 15 cm H2O PEEP on cardiac output, PRA, and PMS (the equilibrium PRA during ventricular fibrillation). To examine the role of neurovascular reflexes, PEEP was applied before and after either carotid sinus and vagal denervation (CSV) or total spinal anesthesia with arterial pressure restored by epinephrine infusion (SAE). To examine the effects of PEEP-induced elevations of abdominal pressure, the abdomen was bound or widely opened and the abdominal contents exteriorized. With reflexes intact, neither binding nor opening the abdomen altered the rise in PMS during PEEP. CSV attenuated the rise in Pms by 17% (Control, 4.89 +/- 0.3 SE; CSV, 4.04 +/- 0.22 mmHg; p less than 0.01), and SAE attenuated it by 49% (Control, 4.21 +/- 0.27; SAE, 2.14 +/- 0.31 mmHg; p less than 0.00005). After either CSV or SAE, the rise in Pms was not affected by binding. PEEP decreased (Pms-PRA) only when the abdomen was bound because of a greater rise in PRA, or during SAE because of a lesser rise in Pms. Under control conditions, PEEP increased Pms and PRA equally [(PRA-Pms) = 3.89 +/- 0.26 without PEEP versus 4.13 +/- 0.29 mm Hg with PEEP]. We conclude that PEEP increases Pms by both reflex and mechanical means independent of increased abdominal pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In patients receiving positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), Ppao may not reflect LV filling pressure because of elevated pericardial pressure (Ppc). It has been proposed that in humans, Ppc and right atrial pressure (PRA) are equal, so that referencing Ppao to PRA may improve the assessment of LV filling pressure when Ppc is elevated. Similarly, it has also been shown in the dog that nadir Ppao immediately after airway disconnection from PEEP (nadir Ppao), accurately reflects LV filling pressure when LV filling pressure is greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg. We examined methods of estimating LV filling pressure using Ppao measurements under conditions in which increases in Ppc were the primary determinants of differences in the two measurements. Using left atrial pressure (PLA) relative to Ppc, called transmural PLA (PLAtm), as LV filling pressure, we compared the accuracy of Ppao, nadir Ppao, and Ppao relative to PRA to reflect PLAtm in 15 postoperative cardiac surgery patients in whom an air-filled pericardial balloon catheter and a left atrial catheter were inserted during surgery. PEEP was sequentially increased from zero to 15 cm H2O. We found that PRA always exceeded Ppc (p less than 0.01) and increased less with PEEP than did Ppc (p less than 0.05). At less than or equal to 5 cm H2O PEEP, both Ppao and nadir Ppao were similar to each other and to PLAtm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Evidence for a systemic origin comes from the low protein concentration of pleural liquid in adult sheep, which is consistent with protein sieving from a high-pressure circulation. During normal development from fetal to adult life, systemic vascular pressure increases. We therefore reasoned that if pleural liquid comes from the systemic circulation, pleural liquid protein concentration relative to plasma protein concentration should decrease during normal development. To test this hypothesis we did thoracotomies on 14 fetal, 9 newborn, and 15 adult sheep and collected pleural liquid and plasma for measurement of total protein and albumin concentrations. In separate experiments we measured steady-state systemic and pulmonary vascular pressures in age-matched chronically instrumented fetal, newborn, and adult sheep. The protein concentration in pleural liquid relative to that in plasma (pleural liquid/plasma) decreased progressively with age (fetuses, 0.50 +/- 0.15 [SD]; newborns, 0.27 +/- 0.08; adult, 0.15 +/- 0.05); the trend was similar for pleural liquid/plasma albumin ratios as a function of age. Systemic arterial pressure increased progressively during development, whereas pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from the fetus to the adult sheep. These observations support the hypothesis that normal pleural liquid originates from a systemic circulation.\r"

We sought to extend this observation in a series of patients with PAP by looking at total serum LDH concentrations and LDH isoenzyme fractions measured before and after whole lung lavage. Total LDH and LDH isoenzymes were also determined in the lavage effluent. Total serum LDH was elevated before lavage in 10 of 16 patients. Prelavage serum LDH and prelavage alveolar-arterial O2 gradient showed a significant correlation (r = 0.62, p less than 0.05). A decrease in serum LDH was found after lavage in all patients in whom postlavage data was available (paired t test, p less than 0.01, n = 11), although the magnitude of this decrease varied considerably. The isoenzyme pattern before lavage was isomorphic, and this pattern was unchanged after whole lung lavage. This was in marked contrast to the LDH isoenzyme pattern observed in the lavage effluent, which showed a lower percent LDH1 and LDH2 and a higher percent LDH3, LDH4, and LDH5 when compared with the corresponding prelavage isoenzyme percentages for serum (unpaired t test, p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between the total serum LDH concentration and the total lavage LDH concentration. These data confirm that elevated serum LDH is a common finding in PAP. Furthermore, the LDH elevation found consistently in the alveolar fluid points to this as the source of the serum LDH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control and exposed rats were examined between 2 and 36 wk after exposure. Lavaged cells were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage with phosphate-buffered saline. Lung wall cells were prepared via collagenase digestion of lung tissue slices. Cells from lavage and lung wall were separated by Percoll density centrifugation. The three upper fractions, containing mostly macrophages, were cultured, and the conditioned medium was assayed for effect on lung fibroblast growth and for activity of the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Results demonstrated that the cells separated from the lung walls exhibited different reaction patterns compared with those cells recovered by lavage. The lung wall cells exhibited a progressive increase in the number of macrophages and lymphocytes compared with a steady state in cells of the lung lavage. This increase in macrophages apparently was due to low density cells, which showed features of silica exposure. Secretion of a fibroblast-stimulating factor was consistently high by lung wall macrophages, whereas lung lavage macrophages showed inconsistent variations. The secretion of NAG was increased in lung lavage macrophages, but decreased at most observation times in lung wall macrophages.

NE levels in the unconcentrated cell-free supernatant of BAL, subjected to high-speed centrifugation (17,000 x g for 30 min) to sediment subcellular debris, were similar in the smokers who abstained overnight from smoking and in the nonsmokers (24.4 +/- 13.9 versus 23.7 +/- 12.3 ng/mg [SD] albumin). NE levels were significantly higher in lavage fluid not subjected to high-speed centrifugation, reflecting the presence of NE bound to subcellular debris that was sedimented by high-speed centrifugation. Concentration by ultrafiltration through a Millipore CX-10 filter was accompanied by loss of protein with a relatively greater loss of NE than albumin, resulting in lower NE/albumin ratios in concentrated than in unconcentrated lavage.

  ".W": "Over the past several years there has been a large increase in the recovery of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates from respiratory specimens submitted to the clinical laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). This increase in MAC recovery correlates with an increase in the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the community. Although it is well known that MAC is often isolated from patients with AIDS, the isolation of MAC from respiratory specimens is often attributed to contamination of the specimen with MAC organisms present in the environment. To determine whether the increase in MAC isolates recovered at SFGH was due to an increase in environmental contamination of specimens or to the increase in our AIDS patient population, we conducted a study of the prevalence of MAC in respiratory specimens from AIDS versus non-AIDS patients. Results of specimens submitted to the clinical laboratory at SFGH for culture of mycobacteria were reviewed over a 12-yr period, from 1977 through 1988. The prevalence of MAC in respiratory specimens from AIDS and non-AIDS patients was determined for 4 yr during this period: the pre-AIDS year 1977; the first year AIDS was reported in San Francisco, 1981; 1984; and 1987. In 1977 and 1981 the prevalence of MAC in respiratory specimens was less than or equal to 0.5%, and all MAC isolates were recovered from non-AIDS patients. In 1984 the prevalence of MAC in respiratory specimens for AIDS and non-AIDS patients was 6.5 and 0.3%, respectively, and in 1987, 8.8 and 0.3%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This circumstance is not analogous to the more frequent chlorine or chlorine dioxide gas overexposures that occur commonly in pulpmills over a background of a low level of gas exposure. To investigate the respiratory health consequences of these accidental exposures (\"chlorine gassing\") in the industrial setting, we carried out a cross-sectional respiratory health survey among workers at a British Columbia coastal pulpmill and a nearby rail maintenance yard. A greater proportion of pulpmill workers were unavailable for study because of illness (10.5% versus 2.4% in the railyard, p less than 0.01). Procedures involved simple spirometry, respiratory symptom assessment, and measurement of average levels of air contaminants. Average chlorine levels in the pulpmill were below 1 ppm; however, 60% of the pulpmill workers reported one or more accidental \"chlorine gassing\" incidents. Pulpmill workers who reported being \"gassed\" were significantly more likely to report wheezing on occasion than were other pulpmill workers and railyard workers (rate for these three groups: nonsmokers: 8, 2, 1%; ex-smokers: 17, 11, 7%; current smokers: 42, 21, 19%; p less than 0.05). No significant lung function differences were found between the overall pulpmill group and the railyard workers; however, nonsmoking and formerly smoking pulpmill workers who reported being \"gassed\" had significantly lower average midmaximal flow rate and FEV1/FVC ratio than did their counterparts in the remainder of the pulpmill population (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a cross-sectional study of a working population of black South African gold miners, 1,197 men were studied with respiratory and occupational questionnaires, lung function tests, and chest radiographs. The study was designed to examine the effects of silicosis on respiratory symptoms and lung function. A total of 857 men with chronic, simple silicosis and 340 men without silicosis were included in the sample. Other determinants of lung disease including the duration and intensity of underground dust exposure and tobacco smoking were also examined. Three distinct pulmonary disorders could be discerned: silicosis-associated pulmonary dysfunction with dyspnea on effort; chronic airflow limitation, which was related to the duration of underground exposure; and a chronic bronchitic symptom complex, which reflected the intensity of dust exposure in the workplace. Chronic, uncomplicated silicosis was found to be associated with significant loss of lung function, and all of the measured indices, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC%, maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMEF), and lung diffusion for carbon monoxide measured by the single-breath method (DLCO) were reduced. When comparing men with Category 3/3 nodule profusion with men without silicosis, reductions of FVC of 351 ml, FEV1 of 447 ml, MMEF of 1.04 L/s, and DLCO of 4.7 ml/min/mm Hg (p = 0.0001) were detected after controlling for age, height, the direct effects of the underground environment, and tobacco smoking. Dyspnea on effort was more common in the men with silicosis (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Peak exposure to ozone (O3) usually occurs in the afternoon and evening, after the fog has dissipated. To determine whether fog containing HNO3 might enhance pulmonary responses to O3, we studied a group of healthy, athletic subjects selected for lung function sensitivity to O3. On 3 separate days, the subjects exercised for 2 h in atmospheres containing HNO3 fog (0.5 mg/ml), H2O fog, or clean, filtered air. After a 1-h break, they exercised for an additional 3 h in an atmosphere containing 0.20 ppm O3. Surprisingly, the mean O3-induced decrements in FEV1 and FVC were smaller after exercise in each fog-containing atmosphere than they were after exercise in clean, filtered air. The mean (+/- SEM) O3-induced decrements in FEV1 were 26.4 +/- 5.3% after air, 17.1 +/- 3.7% after H2O fog, and 18.0 +/- 4.3% after HNO3 fog, and in FVC they were 19.9 +/- 4.7% after air, 13.6 +/- 2.8% after H2O fog, and 13.6 +/- 4.2% after HNO3 fog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91097134\r", 
  ".W": "Though exercise training is part of most pulmonary rehabilitation programs, whether there is a physiologic basis for increased exercise tolerance is unclear. We sought to determine whether patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are capable of obtaining a physiologic training effect, as manifested by a reduction in blood lactate and ventilation (VE) at a given level of exercise. We also sought to determine whether training work rate determines the size of the training effect. Nineteen participants with COPD of predominantly moderate severity in an inpatient rehabilitation program performed two cycle ergometer exercise tests at a low and a high work rate for 15 min or to tolerance and also an incremental exercise test to tolerance. Arterial blood was sampled for blood gas and lactate analyses. Identical tests were performed before and after 5-day-per-week cycle ergometer training for 8 wk either for 45 min/day at a high work rate (average, 71 W) or for a proportionally longer time at a low work rate (average, 30 W). Average FEV1 was 56 +/- 12% predicted and did not change with training. Peak exercise lactate (average, 6.5 mEq/L) was not correlated with FEV1. For the high work rate training group, identical work rates engendered less lactate (4.5 versus 7.2 mEq/L) and less VE (48 versus 55 L/min) after training; the low work rate training group had significantly less lactate and VE decrease (p less than 0.01). Further, endurance time for the high constant work rate increased 73% in the high work rate training group but only 9% in the low work rate training group. At identical work rates, VE decrease average 2.5 L/min per mEq/L decrease in lactate (r = 0.75). We conclude that most COPD subjects studied increased blood lactate at low work rates. Many of these patients were able to achieve a physiologic training effect. Though total work was the same, training at a high work rate was more effective than was training at a low work rate. The lower VE requirement to perform exercise was in proportion to the lower lactate level, but the VE decrease for a given decrease in lactate was smaller than that seen in normal subjects (7.2 L/min/mEq/L), apparently because patients with COPD fall to hyperventilate in response to lactic acidosis (PaCO2 does not drop). These findings provide a physiologic rationale for exercise training of patients with COPD.\r"

We recruited eight self-confessed heavy snorers and six self-confessed nonsnorers. All subjects had full nocturnal polysomnography, including continuous monitoring of snoring, which was quantified by counting the number of snores per hour of sleep (snoring index), the number of snores per minute of snoring time (snoring frequency), maximal and mean nocturnal sound intensity (dBmax and dBmean, respectively). We found that even the self-confessed nonsnorers snored lightly, with significantly smaller frequency and index than the heavy snorers. Sleep architecture was similar in both groups. Distribution of snoring among the sleep stages differed for light and heavy snorers: light snorers snored uniformly throughout all sleep stages, whereas heavy snorers tended to snore more during slow-wave and REM sleep. Snoring frequency and snoring index were similar during all sleep stages in light snorers, but they were higher during slow-wave sleep in heavy snorers. Wakefulness time after sleep onset and sleep efficiency correlated significantly with the snoring index. We conclude that although snoring does not affect sleep architecture in general, it influences sleep efficiency and wakefulness time after sleep onset; this may have an adverse effect on daytime function of heavy snorers.\r"

The control group consisted of 40 healthy reference persons of a sex ratio, age, height, and weight distribution similar to those of the patients. The pulmonary function test included the measurement of the lung volumes and the maximal expiratory flow-volume curves. The values of maximal sniff esophageal (Pes) and transdiaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) were used as parameters for global inspiratory muscle strength and diaphragm strength, respectively. The 12-s maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) test supplied the parameter of inspiratory muscle endurance. The diabetic patients showed a highly significant decreased value for their inspiratory vital capacity (VCin) compared with that of the control subjects (4.75 +/- 0.84 versus 5.36 +/- 1.37 L; p less than 0.01). Inspiratory muscle performance in the diabetic patients was also restricted. Sniff Pes was significantly lower in the diabetic group (p less than 0.05); sniff Pdi (p less than 0.01) and MVV (p less than 0.05) were also low. The results did not correlate with either the duration of diabetes or the quality of metabolic control measured by glycosylated hemoglobin concentration. The reduction of VCin in diabetic patients may have been caused partly by the reduced capacity of the inspiratory muscles.\r"

Unfortunately, the inability of endoscopy to obtain precise distance measurements from the anal verge can make localization of lesions at operation difficult. For this reason, preoperative barium enema or intraoperative colonoscopy have been advocated to further pinpoint the sites of those lesions not thought to be easily located at operation. Five patients are presented in whom malignant lesions of the colon were diagnosed and verified histologically, but were later undetectable at operation or subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Four of these patients underwent laparotomy and three received colon resections. None of these patients' tumors were identified during intraoperative colonoscopy, in the resected bowel on pathologic examination, or on follow-up colonoscopy. A fifth patient is presented who spontaneously passed a polyp containing invasive adenocarcinoma, but multiple colonoscopic examinations have failed to identify the site of the lesion. To date, none of these tumors have recurred with periods of follow-up ranging from 6 months to 2 years. These patients demonstrate a poorly documented and little understood aspect of the behavior of colonic malignancies, i.e., the ability to spontaneously regress or slough from the bowel wall. Based on these instances, localization of potentially malignant colon lesions is recommended with submucosal dye injections at initial endoscopy or with colonoscopy in the operating room immediately prior to operation.\r"

The overall incidence of paraplegia was 10 per cent (4/40), emergency patients 17 per cent (3/18) versus elective patients 4.5 per cent (1/22). Careful preoperative evaluation, standardization of operative technique, and good postoperative management have improved the outlook for these patients who otherwise would progress to eventual rupture and death. Because mortality and morbidity are substantially reduced in elective patients, we recommend that all patients with TAAAs be evaluated for surgery as soon as diagnosis is made.\r"

Patients with normal abdominal CT (12) had mean LC 14.8 k/ml (range 7.2-19.6 k/ml). Eight patients with injuries on CT had mean LC 14.4 k/ml (range 3.5-27.1 k/ml).

These changes are expected in response to severe injury and their determinations did not alter patient care. Combined laboratory urinarlysis (LA) and urine dipstick (DA) analysis for hematuria had sensitivity 75.0 per cent (specificity 81.6%). LA predicted injury with sensitivity 75.0 per cent (specificity 81.6%). DA predicted injury with sensitivity 60.0 per cent (specificity 79.2%).

SVT was caused by pancreatic neoplasm (5), chronic pancreatitis (5), and pancreatic pseudocyst (2).

Two high-risk patients had splenic artery embolization, one as a prelude to splenectomy performed 48 hours later and the other as definitive therapy. One splenectomized patient continued to bleed. No further bleeding occurred in 10 splenectomized patients in follow-up from 1 week to 14 years. Sinistral portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome of splenic vein thrombosis caused by pancreatic pathology and manifests as bleeding gastric varices in patients with a patent portal vein and normal hepatic function.

Patients with simple pancreatitis, pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst, noninfected fluid collection or abscess may all have similar clinical pictures. During the last decade computerized tomography (CT)-guided needle aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections has been increasingly used as a diagnostic tool for pancreatic abscesses. This study reviewed the effectiveness of CT-guided needle aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections at our institution in terms of diagnostic accuracy, correlation with eventual outcome, and safety. Charts of patients who underwent needle aspiration of de novo peripancreatic fluid collections over the past 2 years were reviewed. Thirty-five patients underwent 50 aspirations. Eleven patients (31%) had a positive aspirate culture; seven of these had a positive Gram's stain. There were no false positive Gram's stains but four false negatives. Twenty-four (69%) patients had negative aspirate Gram's stains and cultures. Patients with positive aspirate cultures were treated with antibiotics only (2), CT-guided drain placement (7), or surgical drainage (3). The mortality related to each of these therapeutic modalities was 50 per cent, 0 per cent, and 33 per cent, respectively. Of the 24 patients with negative aspirate cultures, five had no further treatment, 12 received antibiotics, and six underwent CT drain placement. All these patients survived. There was one false negative aspirate culture. This patient underwent delayed surgical drainage but expired. There were no major complications from CT-guided aspiration. CT-guided aspiration appears to be a safe and reliable method of diagnosing infection in peripancreatic fluid collections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum are most frequently managed by procedures that include the formation of a colostomy. Primary repair without colostomy is much less commonly employed. We report nine patients with traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum treated with the intracolonic bypass tube (ICBT) without concomitant colostomy. In all these patients we believe the standard treatment would have included fecal diversion. Four patients sustained blunt trauma and five sustained penetrating trauma. Healing of the colonic anastomosis occurred in all cases, and the ICBTs were passed per rectum between the tenth and nineteenth days postoperatively. On the basis of this study, we conclude that the ICBT has a role in the treatment of selected injuries of the left colon and rectum as a safe means of avoiding a colostomy.\r"

We have used partial splenic embolization (PSE) as an effective alternative to splenectomy. Ten PSE procedures were performed on nine patients without mortality and with minimal morbidity. The age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 32 years (mean 14 years). The causes of splenomegaly and hypersplenism included cystic fibrosis with cirrhosis (2), tyrosinemia and cirrhosis (1); thalassemia (1), hemophilia with Human Immune Deficiency Virus infection (2), chronic hepatitis with portal hypertension (1), malignant histiocytosis (1), and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (1). All procedures were performed under local anesthesia with sedation. A percutaneous femoral artery approach to the splenic artery was used to deliver Ivalon sponge particles (280-800 microns) into the spleen. Splenic infarction was assessed by postembolization angiograms. All of the patients except one demonstrated improvement of hematologic parameters. In one patient, however, cytopenia improved only after a second embolization. In the total series, there was an early mean rise of 8,600/mm3 in the leukocyte count (range 2,900-14,900) and 212,000/mm3 in the platelet count (range 30,000-718,000). Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 7 years. Improvement of the blood picture has been persistent in seven of the eight patients who showed initial improvement. Transient procedural complications included fever (5), pleural effusion (2), pneumonia (1), and splenic abscess (1). One patient had paralytic ileus lasting for 10 days and one patient developed a streptococcal peritonitis 3 weeks after embolization. No patient developed pancreatitis or vascular compromise of other abdominal viscera.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, occurrence of such an entity in carotid arteries of patients after treatment for head and neck carcinoma is unknown. Therefore, we reviewed 179 patient charts who had undergone head and neck operations with or without irradiation between 1979-1987. Of these 179 patients, 107 (59.8%) were dead at time of follow-up. Cause of death was unknown in 42 (40%) patients; in the remainder included: respiratory arrest--33; carcinoma-related--18; cardiac--6;pneumonia--7; and trauma--1. Average interval from treatment to death was 23.5 months. Of the 72 patients known to be alive, follow-up was obtained in 52 patients. Their average age was 64.9 years. Risk factors for atherosclerosis included: male gender--43; smoking--50; hypertension--9; diabetes--4; coronary artery disease--12; and peripheral vascular disease--4. Seventy-five per cent of these patients received postoperative irradiation. Average follow-up was 64.5 months. Duplex scans were performed on 34 patients. Three patients had common or internal carotid stenoses greater than 75 per cent. All of these patients had received irradiation and none of them were symptomatic. Seven patients had carotid stenoses between 50 to 75 per cent; five of these had received irradiation. Of these five patients, one had a stroke 60 months postoperatively, and one had a TIA 36 months postoperatively. The remaining 58 patients (of which 48 had irradiation) had carotid stenoses less than 50 per cent and none were symptomatic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We reviewed records of 125 women who were referred because of nonpalpable, suspicious abnormalities on mammogram, which subsequently proved to be cancer, requiring mammographic localization biopsy and subsequent surgery for therapy. We found that 72 (57.6%) had invasive tumors, 15 (12%) showed evidence of microinvasion and 38 (30.4%) were noninvasive. A total of 115 patients had lymphadenectomy as part of their definitive surgery. Nine (12.7%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had between one and 10 malignant nodes on histologic section. None of the patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors were found to have involved nodes. The mammographic abnormalities which led to biopsy in our series were: calcifications in 74 (59.2%) patients, mass lesions in 39 (31.2%), mass lesions with calcifications in 11 (8.8%), and asymmetry in one (0.8%). Of the nine patients with nodal metastases, seven (77.8%) had a mass with or without calcifications as the indication for biopsy. Increasing tumor size was found to correlate with invasive tumors on histopathologic examination and the incidence of lymph node metastases. Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had a tumor size greater than 1 cm. Further, seven (77.8%) of the nine lymph node positive patients had tumors between 1 and 3 cm in size. Of note, however, is that two (22.2%) patients with microscopic tumors had involved nodes. The 4-year actuarial survival in patients with infiltrating tumors was 85.2 per cent, while that for patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors was 100 per cent (median follow-up of 20 months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three different operative approaches were used. Three patients were treated with colostomy alone; one died and the fistula persisted in one. Five patients underwent staged procedures. One patient died of complications after the second stage of a planned three-stage procedure. Four patients underwent a two-stage procedure (fistula takedown, colectomy with colostomy and colostomy closure), all with good results. Six patients were treated with one-stage fistula takedown, colectomy and primary anastomosis, without major complication. We advocate this as the procedure of choice and emphasize the following principles of epidemiology and management: 1) colovaginal fistula complicates diverticulitis in elderly women usually following hysterectomy; this association may be a factor in etiology; 2) vaginography is useful in diagnosis; and 3) planned one-stage repair is the best surgical approach.\r"

Fluid collections were found in 48 (37%) of the 128 patients with pancreatitis. Thirty-eight developed in the 86 (44%) patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, five in the 33 (15%) with biliary pancreatitis and five in the nine (55%) with other causes of pancreatitis (excluding chronic pancreatitis, trauma, or malignancy). On clinical follow-up of the 48 patients with fluid collections, 21 patients required operation; two died before an operation was done and 25 did not require operation. Operations were done to treat pseudocysts (14), abscess (5), and necrosis (3). One patient had an operation for a pseudocyst and an abscess. All 14 patients requiring operation for pseudocyst had collections greater than 7 cm and 13 of these patients had alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the 25 patients not requiring operation, five were lost to follow-up, and 19 of the 20 who had spontaneous resolution of their fluid collection(s) had collections less than 6 cm in diameter. The eight patients who required operative pancreatic debridement for abscess or necrosis had multiple small fluid collections. In summary, fluid collections were found in one-third of patients with acute pancreatitis and were often associated with the development of local complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since that time, various modifications of the basic bypass circuit have evolved. In addition, temporary bypass shunts have also been described in a variety of positions. The goals of bypass of the thoracic aorta regardless of the technique include prevention of distal hypoperfusion, which can lead to paraplegia, limb loss, multiple organ failure, and sometimes death. Recently, there have been reports of the use of the biomedicus centrifugal pump in bypass circuits of the thoracic aorta. Our series, as well as the success of others, using this variation of a traditional bypass circuit of the thoracic aorta, establishes the biopump's capability of minimizing inherent complications in the bypass circuit.\r"

Thirteen had diagnostic peritoneal lavage (PL) as their initial diagnostic study, and five had computed tomography (CT). All patients who had positive PL were explored emergently, undergoing repair of mesenteric injuries. Three of the five patients with CT as initial studies had delayed recognition of their injuries due to incorrect initial interpretation of the scan in two, and a false negative scan in one. Two of these patients developed intestinal infarction and required bowel resection. There were no complications in the PL group related to surgery; morbidity was greater in those undergoing CT. We conclude that early laparotomy and repair of significant mesenteric injuries is necessary to reduce morbidity, and that PL is a more sensitive indicator of this injury than CT.\r"

The course of the eruption paralleled the time of infusion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Skin biopsy specimens taken from two of the eruptions displayed characteristic changes consisting of a variable mixture of granulocytes and lymphocytes, increased number and size of dermal macrophages, mild to moderate epidermal exocytosis, intercellular edema, and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis of one specimen was notable for keratinocyte intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. Administration of the recombinant human cytokine in pharmacologic doses is postulated to induce changes in the immunologic status of the skin, resulting in the expression of a cutaneous eruption.\r"

Because of the known proliferation and differentiation defects in psoriasis, we compared the calcium distribution of involved vs uninvolved psoriatic lesions and normal human epidermis. Whereas normal human and uninvolved psoriatic epidermis revealed increased calcium-containing precipitates in the uppermost stratum granulosum, in contrast the basal layer of psoriatic lesions contained less extracellular calcium, a condition that favored enhanced proliferation. Moreover, all psoriatic suprabasal cell layers displayed heavier than normal concentrations of calcium, indicating loss of the normal calcium gradient that programs terminal differentiation. This abnormal profile may account for the differentiation defects (eg, parakeratosis) that occur in psoriasis. Finally, psoriatic lesions displayed retained ionic Ca in intercellular domains of the upper stratum granulosum with absence of normal intercellular bilayers, findings that may underlie the abnormal desquamation and permeability barrier in psoriasis.\r"

White patients with alopecia areata have an increase in the phenotype frequencies of DR4 and DQw8 and an increase in genotype frequencies of DR4 and DR5 (now DRw11[5]). These associations are in agreement with those reported in two other studies but are not significant when corrected by the number of HLA antigens tested. Sixty-one percent of all patients with AA have DR4 and/or DRw11(5) specificities vs 40% of controls, with more DR4,DRw11(5) and DQw7(w3), DQw8(w3) heterozygotes among patients. DQw6(w1) phenotype frequencies and DRw52a phenotype and genotype frequencies are significantly decreased in patients with alopecia areata relative to controls. This highly significant negative association with the HLA DRB3 allele DRw52a in whites persisted even when DR4- or DRw11(5)-positive individuals were excluded from the patient and control groups. These data suggest that HLA-DR4 and DRw11(5) with their associated DQw7(w3) and DQw8(w3) specificities may confer susceptibility to alopecia areata, while DRw52a may confer resistance.\r"

Patients with venous disease have a prolonged euglobulin lysis time and elevated plasma fibrinogen levels, yet little is known about the metabolism of fibrinogen and fibrin in such patients. In this study, we have used a technique that involves electrophoresis and densitometric analysis of captured fibrin-related antigens to measure the concentration and proportions of the individual fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products in patients with venous disease of the lower extremity. As a group, patients with venous disease had markedly elevated levels of total fibrin-related antigen and D-dimer, the terminal degradation product of cross-linked fibrin. Levels of D-monomer, the breakdown product of fibrinogen and non-cross-linked fibrin monomer, and a measure of fibrinogenolysis were normal in all patients. In patients with ulcers, the levels of D-dimer were disproportionately higher than expected from fibrin monomer levels. On an individual basis, significant elevations of D-dimer were present in six (55%) of the 11 patients with venous disease with ulcers and in three (43%) of the seven patients with venous disease without ulcers. We conclude that patients with venous disease have uniform evidence for enhanced fibrin formation, as evidenced by elevated levels of total fibrin-related antigen and D-dimer. This is regardless of whether the venous disease is accompanied by ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "Ultraviolet exposure of human skin deletes the function of antigen-presenting Langerhans cells normally resident within the epidermis. Langerhans cells are capable of activating T-lymphocytes by presenting antigens (such as nickel or tumor antigens) to T-lymphocytes. Such activated T-lymphocytes may be involved in the development of contact dermatitis and the immune surveillance of immunogenic skin cancers. Deletion of the function of Langerhans cells does not result in abrogated epidermal antigen presentation since ultraviolet irradiation simultaneously induces the appearance of another epidermal antigen-presenting cell population that is distinct from the Langerhans cell population and seems to induce suppression of the immune response. Suppression of the immune response following ultraviolet irradiation in murine models is critical for growth of immunogenic ultraviolet-induced skin neoplasm. Thus, ultraviolet irradiation of human skin may facilitate the growth of human neoplasms, and the spreading of skin-associated infections due to induction of suppressor T cells.\r"

Anton's syndrome is most commonly encountered in patients with bilateral occipital cortex lesions. Patients previously described who demonstrated Anton's syndrome secondary to a peripheral lesion have had an associated delirium or profound dementia. Our case demonstrates that Anton's syndrome may occur in association with blindness from a peripheral lesion, even in the absence of a delirium or significant dementia. We suggest that the bifrontal dysfunction may have been a critical factor in the production of Anton's syndrome. Implications for the role of frontal lobe dysfunction in the genesis of anosognosia and confabulation are discussed.\r"

In a previous study, we demonstrated neoantigens of the C5b-9 complement membrane attack complex in the muscle microvasculature of childhood and adult cases of dermatomyositis. To further characterize the relationship between the vascular complement deposits and histologic changes, quantitative histopathologic analyses were performed on 39 dermatomyositis biopsy specimens (26 adult, 13 children). There was a significant correlation between the percentage of fascicles with fibers having focal myofibrillar loss, a change seen early in the evolution of ischemic muscle fiber damage, and the percentage of fascicles having capillary deposits of membrane attack complex. Conversely, in biopsy specimens with a higher percentage of fascicles with perifascicular atrophy, membrane attack complex deposits were significantly less common. A fascicle-by-fascicle analysis supported these observations. Patients whose biopsy specimens were negative for microvascular membrane attack complex had clinical weakness for a significantly longer time than those patients with vascular complement deposits. These data support the hypothesis that the complement-mediated vasculopathy is a primary immunopathogenic event in the evolution of muscle lesions in dermatomyositis.\r"

Based on a conservative apraxia rating, ideomotor apraxia occurred in three (33%) of nine patients with a mean duration of disease of 10.4 years. Only two (22%) individuals made no apraxic errors, however, and the group as a whole made apraxic errors in 26% of movements. Apraxia was associated with errors in imitation of nonsymbolic movements but not with errors in recognition of gestures. It correlated significantly with duration of disease and with progressive abnormalities of posture but not with other individual aspects of elementary motor or cognitive function. These associations indicate that apraxia in Huntington's disease may be due primarily to involvement of subcortical motor structures rather than cerebral cortex.\r"

Intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory results were related to CA3 neuronal loss only. Patients who did not demonstrate memory after injection contralateral to the seizure focus had significantly fewer cells in CA3 than patients who did. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between the intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory examination raw score after injection contralateral to the seizure focus and CA3 cell density. Using chi 2 analysis, significant differences were documented in the frequency with which memory was demonstrated after injection contralateral to the seizure focus for groups of patients classified by degree of CA3 neuronal loss. This finding supports prior research showing subfield specificity in some memory processes.\r"

  ".W": "Abolition of speech production after intracarotid amobarbital injection is generally considered evidence for language laterality. However, complex auditory comprehension may be preserved after injection of the dominant (left) side. The possibility that this sparing may be due to the intracarotid amobarbital injection not adequately deactivating some of the areas responsible for speech comprehension in the posterior part of the hemisphere was tested with a task known to be critically dependent on the left posterotemporal-inferoparietal region, one assessing visuo-verbal semantic relatedness. Even when the intracarotid injection of the left side produced marked deficits of speech production, comprehension of semantic relations was still intact in eight of 15 patients. Ten of these 15 patients also received right carotid injections, none of which affected comprehension of semantic relatedness. These data indicate that the intracarotid amobarbital injection cannot always specify the laterality of all language functions, an important concern when considering surgical procedures in the dominant posterotemporal-inferoparietal region.\r"

It is therefore important to determine if patients' complaints of memory impairments are an accurate reflection of real memory disturbance. The relationship between memory complaints (metamemory) and objective memory performance, mood, age, verbal intelligence, and sex was examined in a group of 199 healthy, community dwelling adults (39 to 89 years old). Memory complaints demonstrated a stronger association with depressed mood than with performance on memory tests. Increasing reports of depressive symptoms were associated with more overall memory complaints. Verbal intelligence, age, and sex also contributed to memory complaints. Patients with higher verbal intelligence reported fewer complaints and placed less emphasis on forgetting. Older individuals reported greater frequency of forgetting and greater frequency of using memory techniques. Specific types of memory complaints, seriousness of forgetting, and types of memory aids employed are also described. These results showed that self-rating of memory disturbance by older adults may be related more to depressed mood than to poor performance on memory tests.\r"

In three patients, examined on two occasions from 1 to 7 years, high anti-MAG IgM antibody levels persisted in CSF and serum samples. Among 165 patients with other neurologic diseases, including 60 with multiple sclerosis and 60 control subjects with tension headache, anti-MAG IgM antibodies were detected in the CSF from three patients (two with multiple sclerosis, one with aseptic meningitis), and in the serum sample of one patient with multiple sclerosis.

While augmentation techniques for maintaining or increasing tip projection are useful in selected patients, the majority of rhinoplasties rely on excision of cartilage, particularly cartilage of the cephalic border of the lower lateral crura, to produce the desired cosmetic result. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of lower lateral cartilage excision on nasal tip projection resulting from three common forms of nasal tip surgery. These techniques included cephalic border resection without vertical dome division, cephalic border resection with vertical dome division, and cephalic border resection with dome division and suture reapproximation of the mesial crura, the so-called \"Goldman tip.\" Despite the fact that overall excellent results were obtained and loss of projection was rarely a noticeable feature, a measurable loss of projection can be seen in all but one case in this series. Although loss of tip projection is usually acceptable due to the masking effect, the concurrent reduction in dorsal nasal height, loss of projection must be anticipated in excisional techniques of the lower lateral cartilage.\r"

Arthrograms and tomograms were used in all cases. Forty of the patients (49 joints) were nonsurgical control patients. Diagnostic staging of the cases was accomplished as previously published. A clinical/radiologic assessment index was derived, which included seven measured parameters. Surgical patients, grouped by diagnostic stages and selected operations, were compared with each other and with control patients over the follow-up period (average, 8.1 years; range, 5 to 14 years). The surgical procedures included meniscectomy, reconstructive arthroplasty, and arthroplasty with temporary Silastic (Dow Corning Wright, Arlington, Tenn) implant. The overall success rate for surgical cases with all stages and procedures was 93.8%. In contrast, the control group demonstrated significant clinical and radiographic progression. The surgical results were stage dependent for the same operative procedure. Significantly better success rates were obtained in early-stage cases (96.9%) than in late-stage cases (89.4%). With respect to comparison of operative procedures, it was found that reconstructive arthroplasty provided results superior to those of meniscectomy. There was no significant difference between results obtained by meniscectomy and those by arthroplasty with a temporary Silastic implant. Long-term stability was excellent in most cases. Follow-up radiographic changes for the surgical group were less than expected. On the other hand, radiographic analysis of the control group demonstrated progressive degenerative changes in 73.5% of cases. Complications over the entire study were rare. It was concluded that surgery can provide successful long-term results in the treatment of internal derangements.\r"

To clarify this, 30 dissections of this vascular region were performed. In 15 of 30 dissections, the dorsal scapular artery was dominant and the distal transverse cervical artery arose from the dorsal scapular. In nine of 30 dissections, the transverse cervical artery was dominant and the distal dorsal scapular artery arose from the transverse cervical. In six of 30 dissections, both proximal arteries were of equal caliber with no distal communication. We describe a surgical technique that makes use of the lower trapezius flap with inclusion of the dorsal scapular artery; this technique greatly extends the usefulness of the lower trapezius flap, while decreasing the morbidity caused by division of the upper portion of the trapezius muscle during flap harvest.\r"

  ".W": "The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given.\r"

Fifteen specimens of head and neck tumors were evaluated for sensitivity to the following drugs: cisplatin (DDP) at concentrations of 1.5, 15, and 37.5 micrograms/mL; fluorouracil at concentrations of 4.0, 40, and 100 micrograms/mL; and combinations of cisplatin and fluorouracil in corresponding doses. Growth and measurement of drug responses were successfully completed in 10 specimens (five others were contaminated, four of them prior to instituting rigorous antibiotic washes). The results indicated cisplatin sensitivity in five of 10 patients; fluorouracil sensitivity in four of 10 patients; and fluorouracil-cisplatin sensitivity in seven of eight patients. Our preliminary results indicate that the native-state histoculture technique is feasible to test chemosensitivity of head and neck tumors.\r"

Tuberculin reactions were determined in 59 control subjects. Preoperative FNA cytologic examinations and Mantoux tests were performed on 74 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy. The lymph nodes were then excised and examined histologically and cultured for mycobacteria. Forty-eight, 22, and 4 patients had histologically confirmed tuberculous, non-specific, and malignant lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination alone could detect cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in 37 patients (77%). The predictive value of a strong tuberculin reaction for mycobacterial infection was 100%. The combined use of a Mantoux test and FNA cytologic examination was able to diagnose 43 (90%) of 48 cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis cervical preoperatively. Combined use of FNA cytologic examination and Mantoux test was efficient in the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.\r"

In this study, magnetic resonance imaging was applied to the middle ear of experimental animals with otitis media. Results showed that the presence and distribution of effusion within the middle-ear space could be readily determined. Moreover, following injection of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, a contrast agent, the inflamed middle-ear mucosa could be resolved. A comparison between magnetic resonance imaging and tympanometry with respect to the diagnosis of effusion showed that negative pressure tympanograms were equivocal (50% effusion) and that flat or normal tympanograms were in error in approximately 20% of the observations. These data document a role for magnetic resonance imaging in in vivo studies of the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion.\r"

  ".W": "Individual effects of corticosteroids on the ultrastructure of rat ampullar dark cells were quantitatively determined. Adrenalectomized rats subsequently received either aldosterone or dexamethasone or only hormone solvent via miniosmotic pumps for a period of 14 days. Ampullar tissues of the animals were processed for transmission electron microscopy, and standardized regions of ampullar dark cells were photographed and morphometrically analyzed. Surface density and boundary length of basolateral membrane increased significantly after hormone substitution with aldosterone, but not after replacement with dexamethasone, as compared with animals that received only solvent. No significant differences were observed for other morphological parameters between the groups. This response of ampullar dark cells to aldosterone appears similar to that of principal cells of the collecting duct in comparable experimental conditions. These morphological observations suggest that the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, modulates ampullar dark-cell membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Approximately 1.0% of open heart surgery patients become unweanable from cardiac bypass during the surgical procedure. In addition, nearly 20% of patients accepted for cardiac transplantation die while waiting for a donor heart. Pulsatile pneumatic ventricular assist devices (VADs) provide a realistic solution to these dilemmas. Currently, there are five manufacturers who are competing for the major market share in the clinical use of these devices. Novacor, Thermetics, Thoratec, Symbion, and Abiomed all have competitive VAD systems. Because no one system is optimal for all patients, the limitations, similarities, and strengths of each system should be known to enhance the patient's outcome when using these devices. Successful use of VAD systems, either as a bridge to transplantation or to ventricular recovery, is best approached by adherence to strict patient selection. Once instituted, VAD management centers on detailed attention to anticoagulation and prompt diagnosis and treatment of various complications.\r"
