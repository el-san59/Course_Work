The results obtained from the vibrotactile devices were encouraging, although the units had some shortcomings. Overall, the subjects' test scores with the vibrotactile units were comparable to, if not slightly better than, those with the extracochlear implants.\r"

The vagus nerve was anatomically spared and complete function was restored within 10 months.

All children were healthy and had no known exposure to tuberculosis. None of the children had a history of mycobacteriosis other than tuberculosis. The mean induration was 2.3 +/- 1.8 mm for the first tuberculin reaction and 7.6 +/- 3.3 mm for the second tuberculin reaction (P less than 0.005). Four children had positive reactions (greater than or equal to 10 mm) to the first purified protein derivative test; 18 children were positive upon retesting. Eleven of these latter children had increases of at least 6 mm from reactions less than 10 mm to greater than or equal to 10 mm. The size of the BCG scar was significantly correlated to the size of both the first and second purified protein derivative reactions (P less than 0.01), suggesting that the increased reactivity upon retesting was a consequence of sensitization induced by BCG vaccination 6 years earlier. All children remained healthy after this study was completed. Retesting of tuberculin reactivity within 2 weeks in BCG-vaccinated children with reactions less than 10 mm will produce reactions greater than 10 mm in some healthy children who may not require antituberculosis treatment.\r"

However, amoxicillin may not be the most cost-effective therapy in some settings because of its decreasing efficacy and moderately high rate of minor adverse effects. In this review, the cost effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat otitis media in a large military pediatric clinic are compared, using the decision analysis method. With this model, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxyazole is more cost-effective than amoxicillin, and cefaclor, given twice a day for 5 days, is the next most cost-effective regimen. In addition, the major and minor adverse effects of each of the agents are compared and the additional impact on cost effectiveness is considered.\r"

Significant increases were found in patients with a ventricular septal defect, tricuspid valve atresia, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect but not in those with pulmonary valve stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot. The levels were significantly higher in children with ventricular septal defects (221 +/- 123 pg/mL) or patent ductus arteriosus (124 +/- 38 pg/mL) than in those with atrial septal defects (65 +/- 42 pg/mL) (P less than .01). The increased levels appeared to be correlated with enlargement of the left atrium (r = .85, P less than .01) but not with the right atrial size or the mean right atrial pressure. They were higher in younger than in older healthy infants, but this age difference did not affect the results. These findings indicate that human alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide is released into the circulation in response to chronic atrial expansion in patients with congenital heart disease and may have an important role in volume homeostasis.\r"

Egr-1 encodes a protein with \"zinc-binding finger\" structure. Zinc fingers are a protein structural motif that serve as DNA-binding domains in several transcriptional regulatory proteins. Using low-stringency hybridization with an Egr-1 cDNA probe, we identified a distinct human cDNA (designated EGR2 for early growth response gene-2), which is coregulated with EGR1 by fibroblast and lymphocyte mitogens; however, several stimuli that induce Egr-1 mRNA in PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells do not induce Egr-2 mRNA. The cDNA sequence predicts a protein of 406 amino acids, including three tandem zinc fingers of the Cys2-His2 class. Strikingly, the deduced amino acid sequences of human EGR2 and mouse Egr-1 are 92% identical in the zinc finger region but show no similarity elsewhere. EGR2 maps to human chromosome 10 at bands q21-22. Structure-function analysis of EGR2 and EGR1 proteins should provide insight into the mechanisms linking signal transduction and transcriptional regulation of gene expression.\r"

Unexpectedly, partial amino acid sequences displayed no homology with the primary structures of the protein Ser/Thr phosphatases deduced from cDNA clones. However, the sequence is strikingly similar to the tandem C-terminal homologous domains of the leukocyte common antigen (CD45). A 157-residue segment of PTPase 1B displayed 40% and 33% sequence identity with corresponding regions from cytoplasmic domains I and II of human CD45. Similar degrees of identity have been observed among the catalytic domains of families of regulatory proteins such as protein kinases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. On this basis, it is proposed that the CD45 family has protein tyrosine phosphatase activity and may represent a set of cell-surface receptors involved in signal transduction. This suggests that the repertoire of signal transduction mechanisms may include the direct control of an intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase, offering the possibility of a regulatory balance with those protein tyrosine kinases that act at the internal surface of the membrane.\r"

This block was imposed by carrying out the splicing reaction in nuclear extracts preincubated in 2.5 mM EDTA. Preparative amounts of the spliceosomes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography and shown to be functional by in vitro complementation assays. The unspliced pre-mRNA in the complex was converted to spliced products when incubated in cytoplasmic S100 extracts or in heat-treated or micrococcal nuclease-treated nuclear extracts. The latter result, in conjunction with the size of the complex, suggests that the spliceosome contains all of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) required for both steps of the splicing reaction. Biochemical characterization of the 5' cleavage reaction revealed that ATP and MgCl2 are required for this step in the splicing pathway. The presence of U1 snRNP in the blocked complex was demonstrated by quantitative immunoprecipitation of this complex by an anti-U1 snRNP monoclonal antibody.\r"

  ".W": "Tyrosinase (monophenol monooxygenase; monophenol, L-dopa:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin. Reduced levels of tyrosinase play an important role in albinism. The data described here show differences in the expression and characteristics of tyrosinase in cutaneous murine melanocytes grown in culture from normal wild-type strains (C/C); from three albino locus mutants: himalayan (ch/ch), chinchilla (cch/cch), and albino (c/c); and from the double-mutant heterozygous pink-eyed chinchilla (cchp/cp). Our results suggest that the diminished pigmentation in all mutants is due to abnormal posttranslational modification of the enzyme: the levels of mRNA for tyrosinase in wild-type, himalayan, and pink-eyed chinchilla melanocytes are similar; the himalayan mutation confers a deficiency in N-linked glycosylation, which results in an extremely unstable enzyme that is also temperature sensitive; the chinchilla and albino mutations confer susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage; the pink-eye dilution confers a reduction in the levels of immunoprecipitable tyrosinase, and what little enzyme there is fails to be translocated from the trans-Golgi network to melanosomes. The kinetics of activation and inhibition of the enzyme by the cofactor dopa are unique for the mutants tested and differ from those of tyrosinase from wild-type melanocytes. The findings support the conclusion that the albino locus in mice encodes the structural gene of tyrosinase.\r"

  ".W": "Deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase [pyruvate:lipoamide 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating and acceptor-acetylating), EC 1.2.4.1], the first component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, is associated with lactic acidosis and central nervous system dysfunction. Using both specific antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase and cDNAs coding for its two alpha and beta subunits, we characterized pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency in 11 patients. Three different patterns were found on immunologic and RNA blot analyses. (i) Seven patients had immunologically detectable crossreactive material for the alpha and beta proteins of pyruvate dehydrogenase. (ii) Two patients had no detectable crossreactive protein for either the alpha or beta subunit but had normal amounts of mRNA for both alpha and beta subunits. (iii) The remaining two patients also had no detectable crossreactive protein but had diminished amounts of mRNA for the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase only. These results indicate that loss of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity may be associated with either absent or catalytically inactive proteins, and in those cases in which this enzyme is absent, mRNA for one of the subunits may also be missing. When mRNA for one of the subunits is lacking, both protein subunits are absent, suggesting that a mutation affecting the expression of one of the subunit proteins causes the remaining uncomplexed subunit to be unstable. The results show that several different mutations account for the molecular heterogeneity of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.\r"

  ".U": "89017194\r", 
  ".W": "Progressive cerebral deposition of extracellular filaments composed of the beta-amyloid protein (beta AP) is a constant feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Since the gene on chromosome 21 encoding the beta AP precursor (beta APP) is not known to be altered in AD, transcriptional or posttranslational changes may underlie accelerated beta AP deposition. Using two antibodies to the predicted carboxyl terminus of beta APP, we have identified the native beta APP in brain and nonneural human tissues as a 110- to 135-kDa protein complex that is insoluble in buffer and found in various membrane-rich subcellular fractions. These proteins are relatively uniformly distributed in adult brain, abundant in fetal brain, and detected in nonneural tissues that contain beta APP mRNA. Similarly sized proteins occur in rat, cow, and monkey brain and in cultured human HL-60 and HeLa cells; the precise patterns in the 110- to 135-kDa range are heterogeneous among various tissues and cell lines. Confirmation that the immunodetected tissue proteins are forms of beta APP was obtained when mammalian cells transfected with a full-length beta APP cDNA showed selectively augmented expression of 110- to 135-kDa proteins and specific immunocytochemical staining. Unexpectedly, the antibodies to the carboxyl terminus of beta APP labeled amyloid-containing senile plaques in AD brain. We conclude that the highly conserved beta APP molecule occurs in mammalian tissues as a heterogeneous group of membrane-associated proteins of approximately 120 kDa. Detection of the nonamyloidogenic carboxyl terminus within plaques suggests that proteolytic processing of the beta APP into insoluble filaments occurs locally in cortical regions that develop beta-amyloid deposits with age.\r"

Most (11) of these 16 mAbs also recognized the previously characterized multiphosphorylation repeat in the human middle sized NF subunit. However, although these mAbs shared the ability to recognize NFTs, the antigen-binding domains of these 16 mAbs represented 13 separate classes based on their differential recognition of 12 synthetic peptides derived from the rat heaviest NF subunit and the human middle-sized NF subunit multiphosphorylation sites, NF subunits of 10 diverse species, and normal human tau protein.

  ".W": "The aldosterone-induced augmentation of Na+ transport in toad bladder was analyzed by comparing the hormonal actions on the transepithelial short-circuit current and on the amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake in isolated membrane vesicles. Incubating bladders with 0.5 microM aldosterone for 3 hr evoked more than a 2-fold increase of the short-circuit current (because of the activation or insertion of apical amiloride-blockable channels) but had no effect on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in apical vesicles derived from the treated tissue. A longer incubation (e.g., 6 hr) produced an additional augmentation of the short-circuit current, which was accompanied by about a 3-fold increase of the channel activity in isolated membranes. The stimulatory effect of aldosterone sustained in vesicles was inhibited by the antagonist spironolactone (present at 1000-fold excess) and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (1 microM). In addition, triiodothyronine and butyrate, previously reported to partly inhibit the aldosterone-induced increase in short-circuit current, blocked the hormonal effect in vesicles. It is suggested that aldosterone elevates the apical Na+ permeability of target epithelia by two different mechanisms: a relatively fast effect (less than or equal to 3 hr), which is insensitive to triiodothyronine or butyrate and is not sustained by the isolated membrane, and a slower or later (greater than 3 hr) response blocked by these reagents, which is preserved by the isolated membrane. The data also indicate that these processes are mediated by different nuclear receptors.\r"

An in vitro replication system derived from a B. subtilis DNA-membrane complex showed initiation activity without addition of exogenous enzymes or template. When the complex was first incubated with the 64-kDa antibody or with its Fab fragments, initiation activity was enhanced. Antibodies to several other Bacillus membrane proteins as well as nonspecific antibodies did not show any significant stimulatory effect. A heavy-density-label experiment indicated that the complex initiated multiple rounds of replication in the presence of the 64-kDa antibody but not in its absence. The 64-kDa antibody plus an initiation inhibitor (streptovaricin) showed only repair and elongation activity. The 64-kDa protein may act in vivo as a repressor/regulator of initiation activity.\r"

The protein fraction forms a joint molecule between a circular single-strand DNA and a homologous linear duplex DNA that is resolved from the substrates by agarose gel electrophoresis. A strand-exchange activity can be obtained from nuclear extracts from embryos as old as 24 hr. The activity is similar to that partially purified from human cells [Hsieh, P., Meyn, S.M. & Camerini-Otero, R.D. (1986) Cell 44, 885-894]. It is homology-dependent, requires Mg2+, appears to be directional in that it prefers to displace the 3' end of the noncomplementary strand, and does not require exogenous ATP. Forty nanograms of protein in the partially purified DNA strand-exchange fraction from D. melanogaster embryos can completely convert 50 ng of substrate single-strand DNA into joint molecules in 10 min. In the electron microscope, joint molecules are seen to consist of a circular single-strand DNA molecule attached to only one end of a linear duplex DNA molecule; a displaced strand is also seen. The region of heteroduplex formation can be as long as 600 base pairs. The demonstration of a strand-exchange activity from wild-type D. melanogaster embryos invites analysis of recombination-defective mutants to explore the role of DNA strand exchange in homologous recombination.\r"

To understand the structure-function relationship of subunit S1 and guide the construction of nontoxic molecules suitable for vaccines, we constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli a series of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants as well as a number of molecules containing amino acid substitutions. The shortest peptide still retaining enzymatic activity contains amino acids 2-179. Within this region we identified three mutants in which amino acid substitutions abolish the enzymatic activity. Mutation of amino acids 8 and 9 or 50 and 53, located within the region of the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin homologous to cholera toxin, causes loss of enzymatic activity. Outside this homology region, substitution of Glu-129 with glycine or aspartic acid also eliminates the enzymatic activity of the S1 subunit. In this respect, Glu-129 resembles the glutamic acid that is crucial for the catalytic activity of diphtheria and Pseudomonas toxins. Once introduced into the Bordetella pertussis chromosome, the above mutations should lead to the synthesis of nontoxic pertussis toxin molecules suitable for vaccine production.\r"

Expression of this transcription unit was shown by the appearance in the bacteria of proteins of molecular weight higher than that of native beta-galactosidase, which are immunoreactive with anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies. Production of beta 2-adrenergic receptors was shown by the presence, on intact bacteria, of binding sites for catecholamine agonists and antagonists possessing a typical beta 2-adrenergic pharmacological profile. Binding and photoaffinity labeling studies performed on intact E. coli and its membrane fractions showed that these binding sites are located in the inner membrane of the bacteria. Expression of pharmacologically active human beta 2-adrenergic receptors in E. coli further supports the similar transmembrane organization proposed for bacteriorhodopsin and eukaryotic membrane-embedded receptors coupled to guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Moreover, this system should facilitate future analyses of the ligand-binding properties within this family of membrane receptors.\r"

To determine the nature of this resistance, we examined the expression and properties of the Rous sarcoma virus transforming protein pp60v-src, in infected embryonic chicken limbs in ovo. Lysates from Rous sarcoma virus-infected limbs contained the viral structural protein p19gag, as detected by immunoblot analysis, and showed pp60v-src kinase activity in vitro. Immunoblot analysis of lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a number of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in lysates of Rous sarcoma virus-infected embryos but not in lysates of control, uninfected embryos. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity was observed in frozen sections in the same cell types that expressed pp60v-src and p19gag. These studies demonstrate that pp60v-src is co-expressed with viral structural determinants in infected embryonic avian tissue. Furthermore, pp60v-src is active in ovo as a tyrosine-specific phosphotransferase, despite the apparent lack of sarcoma induction. The localization pattern of the major src gene substrate p36 (calpactin I) was compared with that of p19gag by double-label immunofluorescence and found to be generally nonoverlapping. These observations are consistent with the concept that the induction of tumors in ovo requires complementation between viral determinants and host factors. These host factors, which may be critical substrates of pp60v-src, are subject to developmental regulation in the avian embryo.\r"

The results indicate that ORF3 encodes a sigma homolog, whose expression is highly regulated during development. Analysis of the ORF3 nucleotide sequence reveals an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 260 amino acid residues (molecular mass of 30.1 kDa). Its predicted amino acid sequence shows significant similarity to that of other RNA polymerase sigma factor sequences. S1 nuclease mapping experiments indicate that ORF3 is initially cotranscribed with spoIIG from about 1 to 4 hr into the sporulation process and that later on ORF3 is transcribed independently from a new site located between spoIIG and ORF3. The role of ORF3 was investigated by constructing a deletion mutation in its structural gene. The mutant exhibits normal growth but is unable to produce heat-resistant spores. We propose that the ORF3 gene product is a sigma factor or a related peptide essential for sporulation at a late stage of development.\r"

The retinal-specific transducin subunit genes GNAT1 and GNAT2 were on chromosomes 3 and 1; GNAI1, GNAI2, and GNAI3 were assigned to chromosomes 7, 3, and 1, respectively; GNAZ and GNAS were found on chromosomes 22 and 20. The beta subunits were also assigned--GNB1 to chromosome 1 and GNB2 to chromosome 7. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms were used to map the homologues of some of these genes in the mouse. GNAT1 and GNAI2 were found to map adjacent to each other on mouse chromosome 9 and GNAT2 was mapped on chromosome 17. The mouse GNB1 gene was assigned to chromosome 19. These mapping assignments will be useful in defining the extent of the G alpha gene family and may help in attempts to correlate specific genetic diseases with genes corresponding to G proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoglobulin heavy-chain switching is effected by a DNA recombination event that replaces the C mu gene with one of the other heavy-chain constant-region (CH) genes located 3' to the C mu gene. How the specificity of this event is controlled is unknown. However, it has been shown that IgM+ cells capable of switching to specific isotypes have the corresponding unrearranged CH genes in an accessible or active chromatin state, as demonstrated by the fact that these specific CH genes are hypomethylated and are transcriptionally active. We now report that the RNAs transcribed from specific unrearranged CH genes are induced prior to switching under conditions that promote switching to these specific CH genes. For example, we find that bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which induces the IgM+ cell line I.29 mu to switch to IgA, induces transcripts from the germ-line C alpha gene(s) in I.29 mu cells prior to switch recombination. Two preparations of T-cell lymphokines (recombinant interleukin 4 and supernatant from the T-cell line 2.19, which contains interleukins 4 and 5) that promote switching to specific isotypes by lipopolysaccharide-treated spleen cells induce transcripts from the corresponding germ-line CH genes prior to expression of the new isotypes. For example, interleukin 4, which appears to be necessary for switching to IgE in vitro and in vivo, induces within 2 days large increases in germ-line C epsilon transcripts in lipopolysaccharide-treated spleen cells and in I.29 mu cells. The most straightforward interpretation of our data is that these lymphokines direct switching to specific isotypes by activating specific CH genes, making them accessible to the putative switch recombinase.\r"

Lymphocytes from all animals tested expressed on common MHC class I allelic product. Another MHC class I allelic product was expressed by 39 of 41 tested animals. Four other allelic products were also expressed on the lymphocytes of these animals at a frequency of greater than 50%. MHC class II gene products, however, were polymorphic. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed that there were a limited number of cotton-top tamarin MHC class I alleles, whereas the MHC class II gene loci were polymorphic. This sharing of MHC class I alleles is unprecedented in a higher primate species and may play a role in the susceptibility of this endangered species to pathogens.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that bispecific hybrid antibodies produced by cell-cell fusion or chemically conjugated heteroaggregates can direct cytotoxic T lymphocytes to kill target cells for which they have no intrinsic specificity, a phenomenon we call effector cell retargeting (ECR). These studies used bispecific reagents with one specificity directed to CD3 or Ti on the effector cell and the other directed to a target cell antigen. To avoid the need to create different hybrid hybridomas for each target antigen we have developed a universal means to elicit ECR through the use of an antiglobulin step. We have constructed a bispecific hybrid antibody with dual specificity for CD3 and a rat immunoglobulin light chain allotype. This bispecific antibody could mediate ECR to a range of target cells, each coated with distinct surface-binding rat monoclonal antibodies. A particular advantage of targeting to surface-bound monoclonal antibodies is that all other available effector systems may also attack the same antibody-coated target cell.\r"

  ".U": "89017287\r", 
  ".W": "The role of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in the cAMP-dependent action of serotonin (5-HT) and the antagonistic action of the neuropeptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRF-amide), mediated by the lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, was investigated in Aplysia sensory neurons. Intracellular injection of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma-S]) mimics the hyperpolarizing action of FMRF-amide due to activation of the S K+ current and alters the transient response to FMRF-amide into an irreversible (or only partially reversible) response. At higher concentrations, GTP[gamma-S] occludes the response to FMRF-amide. Injection of activated pertussis toxin inhibits the response to FMRF-amide but not to 5-HT. Injection of guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate inhibits the response to FMRF-amide by approximately equal to 50% and completely blocks the response to 5-HT. Three lines of evidence suggest that the FMRF-amide-activated G protein is involved at an early stage of the arachidonic acid cascade, prior to the release of arachidonate. (i) Pertussis toxin injection blocks the hyperpolarizing response to FMRF-amide but not to exogenously applied arachidonic acid. (ii) Two blockers of the arachidonic acid cascade inhibit the hyperpolarizing responses to both FMRF-amide and GTP[gamma-S] (and unmask a 5-HT-like depolarizing response to the nucleotide). (iii) Concentrations of GTP[gamma-S] that alter the kinetics of the FMRF-amide response have no effect on the hyperpolarizing response to arachidonic acid. We conclude that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein most likely acts to couple the FMRF-amide receptor to phospholipase activation and arachidonic acid release, whereas a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein couples the 5-HT receptor to adenylate cyclase.\r"

In most local, provincial, and national jurisdictions, such responsibility has been assumed by doctors of clinical medicine, who know much about treatment of disease in individual patients but very little about prevention of disease and promotion of health in populations or the management of health systems. Effective leadership in public health requires a new profession, with generalized education in the basic tools of social analysis, health and disease in populations, promotion of health and prevention of disease, and health care systems and their management. More than 40 distinct scientific subjects have been developed in these fields over the years, and current faculties are qualified to teach them. To provide this education would require about 5 years of academic and field studies, after a bachelor's degree. Schools of public health now train doctoral-level specialists who are prepared in the PhD tradition for academic posts. These schools should also develop educational programs for doctoral-level generalists who are qualified to provide community health leadership at local, provincial, and national levels.\r"

  ".W": "A communitywide outbreak of hepatitis A occurred in Portland, OR, from 1983 through 1986. At the peak of the outbreak, the age- and sex-specific annual incidence rate approached 400 cases per 100,000 population among men ages 25 to 34, the highest risk group. The community incidence rate was nearly 10 times the relevant national incidence rate. A review of the records concerning cases of hepatitis A reported in the last 6 months of 1985 revealed that about half the number of young adults whose cases were investigated during that time reported a history of intravenous (IV) drug use--a proportion about 50 times greater than expected among persons in that age range. A simultaneous epidemic of overdose deaths from heroin and a concomitant increase in hepatitis B incidence rates led to the suspicion that this was a drug-abuse-associated epidemic of hepatitis among new IV drug users. Control of this outbreak was difficult because the population most at risk was distrustful of public health officials. Increased surveillance in food service establishments and schools might have prevented outbreaks from a common source in the general population; however, an increase of sporadic cases in the nondrug-using population clearly occurred.\r"

This perception may be studied at an aggregate level by comparing malpractice insurance premiums, a proxy for liability risk, with primary cesarean section rates. Both New York and Illinois are divided into territories for insurance rates; the premium was uniform within each territory over the period studied for each specialty. Premiums for obstetricians were linked to birth and procedure data from New York and Illinois hospitals for 1981 and 1983, respectively, to determine whether there was a correlation between premium levels and the primary cesarean section rate. A statistically significant difference was found between mean cesarean rates by insurance premium territories in each State. A correlation was observed between increased insurance rates among territories and increased cesarean section rates. Based on these results, a substantial impact was found on delivery decisions resulting from the fear of malpractice suits.\r"

Only those infants with birth weights of 2,500 grams (g) or less were studied. Analyses were made of the scope, magnitude of error, and direction of the discrepancies observed. Concordance was considered present if the discrepancy in birth weight was 30 g or less. HDVS birth tapes and the hospital charts of 3,864 neonates were reviewed. The study population came from 48 of 53 hospitals in the metropolitan area. Hospitals were divided into three categories by the level of care offered. Each level of care was subdivided into groups by type of hospital ownership, that is, proprietary, voluntary, and municipal. Concordance was 87 percent overall and ranged from 67 to 96 percent among the study hospitals. More discrepancies were found for levels II and III hospitals than in level I hospitals, those with less sophisticated resources. Municipal hospitals had more discrepancies in birth weights than voluntary hospitals. Infants who had been transported from the birth facility to another facility had significantly higher concordance rates than the nontransported infants, after adjusting for levels of care, type of ownership of the hospital, and birth weight categories. Increased concordance rates were shown to be associated with increased birth weights.\r"

Costs are based on both retrofitting old buses with belts and installing them in new buses. Benefits include the direct and indirect (forgone earnings) cost-savings from preventable injuries and fatalities. Results indicate that a law mandating safety belts in Texas school buses would not be cost-beneficial. Annual benefits would exceed the annual costs of installing belts in new school buses. However, the benefits would not be large enough to compensate for the five-year costs associated with retrofitting old buses.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency of inaccuracies in racial designations of school children in a health survey, racial designations were examined for a sample of 1,509 children in Minneapolis public schools who participated in the first home interview of the Minneapolis Children's Blood Pressure Study. The data were obtained from three sources: the school enrollment data based on parentally supplied information and teachers' visual judgments, school survey interviewers participating in a research project, and the parents themselves, at home interviews. Assuming the correctness of the information obtained from the parent in the home interview, cross tabulation comparisons were made of the accuracy of the information obtained from the other sources, and within sources. Results show a high degree of agreement between the parents' or teachers' designations at enrollment, and survey interviewers' sight judgments. Furthermore, sight judgments of interviewers show high repeatability. There was a significant degree of disagreement between the designations by teachers' and screeners' visual judgments, obtained in school, and the interviews with the parents. Misidentification occurred for up to 20 percent of Native American children, a rate which, if prevalent, may significantly affect public health studies which are based on racial identifications of school children. When possible, researchers studying Native American or mixed race populations should verify racial designations from school documents or sight judgments. Questionnaires to be answered by parents need to have sufficiently detailed categories to enable parents of different racial groups to identify different racial groups accurately.\r"

Data were derived from case reports of S. dublin isolations from persons in the State of California during the period 1980-83 and from production figures for raw milk from the major supplier. It is estimated that more than one-third of reported S. dublin infections in California in the first 4 years of this decade were attributable to raw milk consumption. Among raw milk consumers, it is estimated that more than 95 percent of reported S. dublin infections were acquired from raw milk; this proportion corresponds to a rate of reported S. dublin infections acquired from raw milk in the range of 8 to 35 cases per 100,000 users per year. It appears that immunocompromised persons are at exceptionally high risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from S. dublin exposure, and therefore raw milk is a particular health hazard for such persons.\r"

NIDR's legislation contained the mandate to conduct research and research training to improve oral health. An impetus for federally funded dental research was the finding in World War II that the major cause of rejection for military service was missing teeth. Because of the population's widespread tooth decay problems, early NIDR research focused on eliminating dental caries. NIDR scientists confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the use of fluoride in tooth decay prevention, leading to one of the nation's most successful public health efforts, community water fluoridation. During the past 40 years, NIDR scientists have provided research advances and fostered technologies which changed the philosophy and practice of dentistry and brought dental sciences into the mainstream of biomedical research. Dental researchers contribute to studies of such diseases and problems as AIDS, cancer, arthritis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, herpes, craniofacial anomalies, pain, and bone and joint disorders. NIDR's 40th anniversary in 1988 recognizes its continuing commitment to oral disease prevention and health research, and to achieving the goal of people maintaining their natural dentition for a lifetime.\r"

The 1971 study by Vlado Getting supported the Emerson report and suggested alternative methods to provide public health services via multi-county area health service agencies for rural areas of Illinois. The number of local agencies in the State has doubled since the mid-1960s, yet a majority of rural counties have maintained a single-county health agency rather than forming multi-county arrangements. In effect, potential economies of scale have been forfeited. In northwest Illinois, however, eight local health departments, covering both rural and urban areas, have formed a multi-county consortium to identify and meet several overlapping program needs. This Region I consortium, with a population base of 590,000, was created as a result of the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reduction Act. Through the block grants created by the act, funds became available for preventive health and health promotion activities in fiscal year 1982. Once in place, the consortium provided a cost effective means to manage the Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Feeding Program (WIC) and some elements of family planning programs in Region I. The consortium approach offers numerous opportunities for future growth and regionalization of services.\r"

NMCUES was a national probability household survey jointly sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics and the Health Care Financing Administration. NMCUES also included four State Medicaid Household Surveys. Data from both the national sample, for all low-income people, and from the four State surveys, for Medicaid people, were included in this analysis. The NMCUES data provided several measures which were previously unavailable on Medicaid experience, in particular, detailed Medicaid eligibility information in combination with income, health status, and health care use. This information can provide a comparison between access to care for those covered by Medicaid, and other low-income persons. In 1980 Medicaid covered a minority of poor and low-income people, only 44 percent of the poor younger than 65 years of age and 38 percent of poor people 65 years of age and older. While almost all elderly had Medicare coverage, about 25 percent of younger low-income people had no form of health insurance, compared with only 9 percent of nonpoor persons who were uninsured. Another measure of access is a regular source of care, the \"place where a person goes for health care when sick.\" In 1980, 15 percent of people younger than 65 who were covered by Medicaid had no regular source of care. This is similar to the rate for the privately insured. However, the types of providers that were cited as the regular source of care differed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The classification and mechanism of formation of these bony excrescences are not totally clear in all instances, but there is frequent association with degenerative disk change. Distorted alignment of the spinal column as in scoliosis, and functional demands on the spine, play major roles in these abnormalities. The true degree of anatomic abnormality is greater than can be appreciated on the radiographs. Syndesmophytes are vertically orientated outgrowths of trabecular bone forming in the outer margins of the annulus fibrosus and related to repeated episodes of inflammation and repair. They are classically seen in ankylosing spondylitis and colonic spondyloarthropathy. Bulky paravertebral excrescences are more likely to be found in psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's syndrome. Other bony excrescences in the spine were also discussed. OPLL is a progressive disease that can result in severe radicular and myelopathic symptoms. Although OPLL appears to have an unexplained predilection for Asians, it affects all races. Classically diagnosed on lateral radiographs of the cervical spine, it is best imaged with CT. Proper evaluation of the extent of the entire ossified mass and its effect on the spinal cord is crucial in the planning of adequate therapy.\r"

The total costs of screening 784 men were $130,400 with transrectal US and $41,080 with digital rectal examination. Per diagnosed cancer, the costs were $6,520 for transrectal US and $4,108 for digital rectal examination, a difference of 37%. The costs per early diagnosed cancer (stage A or B) were $7,671 and $5,869 for transrectal US and digital rectal examination, respectively--a difference of 23%. The costs per early cancer that would have been advanced if diagnosed without screening were $22,177 for transrectal US and $28,528 for digital rectal examination--a difference of 22% in favor of transrectal US. Equations for these relative costs were generated for transrectal US and digital rectal examination. Costs are related to changes in prevalences and to changes in the stages of prostate cancer when diagnosed without screening.\r"

A pair of consensus sequences, X and Y, is found upstream of all class II genes, and deletion of each of these sequences eliminates expression of transfected genes. Furthermore, the absence of a specific X box binding protein in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease whose cells lack class II suggests an important role for these proteins in class II regulation. Here, the cloning of two lambda gt11 complementary DNAs encoding DNA binding proteins (murine X box binding proteins lambda mXBP and lambda mXBP-2) is reported. Both phage-encoded fusion proteins bind specifically to the X box of the A alpha, but not to E alpha or E beta class II genes. These two independent isolates do not cross-hybridize. The lambda mXBP complementary DNA hybridizes to two RNA species, 6.2 and 3.0 kilobases in mouse, that are expressed in both Ia positive and Ia negative cells. By means of DNA blot analysis with the lambda mXBP complementary DNA insert and probes generated from each end of this complementary DNA insert, lambda mXBP was found to arise from a multigene family. These data illustrate the high degree of complexity in the transcriptional control of this coordinately regulated gene family.\r"

Amino acid residues 8 to 15 of PTX subunit S1 are important for the adenosine diphosphate-ribosyltransferase activity associated with the pathobiological effects of PTX. Furthermore, this region contains at least a portion of an epitope that elicits both toxin-neutralizing and protective antibody responses in mice. The gene encoding the S1 subunit was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis in this critical region. A mutant containing a single amino acid substitution (Arg9----Lys) had reduced enzymatic activity (approximately 0.02% of control) while retaining the protective epitope. This analog S1 molecule may provide the basis for a genetically detoxified PTX with potential for use as a component of an acellular vaccine against whooping cough.\r"

This long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is the most compelling cellular model in the vertebrate brain for learning and memory. The critical role of postsynaptic calcium in triggering LTP has been directly examined using three types of experiment. First, nitr-5, a photolabile nitrobenzhydrol tetracarboxylate calcium chelator, which releases calcium in response to ultraviolet light, was used. Photolysis of nitr-5 injected into hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells resulted in a large enhancement of synaptic transmission. Second, in agreement with previous results, buffering intracellular calcium at low concentrations blocked LTP. Third, depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane so that calcium entry is suppressed prevented LTP. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an increase in postsynaptic calcium is necessary to induce LTP and sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission.\r"

Mutant repressors were tested for binding to each member of a set of 28 different operators closely related to the consensus trp operator. Of the 36 mutant repressors, 11 bind a subset of the 28 operators; 5 of these have new binding specificities. These new specificities indicate that the hydroxyl group of Thr81 makes a specific contact with one of the four critical base pairs in a trp operator half-site, and the methyl group of Thr81 determines specificity at a second, critical base pair. The Trp repressor does not use the first two amino acids of its \"recognition alpha-helix,\" Ile79 and Ala80, to make sequence-specific DNA contacts, and interacts with its operator in vivo in a way fundamentally different from the way that phage lambda repressor, lambda Cro protein, and coliphage 434 repressor contact their respective binding sites.\r"

Signal sequence replacement may result from the alternative resolution of an intermediate in VH-to-DJH recombination. This type of rearrangement provides a means to alter the targeting of immunoglobulin gene segments and suggests a mechanism for the occurrence of VH-JH junctions in vivo. Signal sequence replacement may represent an additional pathway for the generation of antibody diversity.\r"

The dependence on deoxycholate is shown to result from association of NF-kappa B with a 60- to 70-kilodalton inhibitory protein (I kappa B). The fractionated inhibitor can inactivate NF-kappa B from various sources--including the nuclei of phorbol ester-treated cells--in a specific, saturable, and reversible manner. The cytoplasmic localization of the complex of NF-kappa B and I kappa B was supported by enucleation experiments. An active phorbol ester must therefore, presumably by activation of protein kinase C, cause dissociation of a cytoplasmic complex of NF-kappa B and I kappa B by modifying I kappa B. this releases active NF-kappa B which can translocate into the nucleus to activate target enhancers. The data show the existence of a phorbol ester-responsive regulatory protein that acts by controlling the DNA binding activity and subcellular localization of a transcription factor.\r"

No sex differences in hybridization patterns were observed. Hybridization of ZFY to polyadenylated RNA indicates that reptilian versions of this gene are expressed in embryos of both sexes during the temperature-sensitive period. If these highly conserved sequences are important in reptilian sex determination, then temperature-dependent and genotypic sex determination may have a similar molecular basis. For reptiles with XX/XY or ZZ/ZW systems, the absence of sex differences in hybridization patterns raises the question of whether the ZFY sequences reside on their sex chromosomes.\r"

Since immunological responsiveness is controlled mainly by genes mapping within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), the humoral immune response to the zygote surface antigens and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the CS protein were examined in MHC-disparate congenic mouse strains. Only two of six strains responded to the 230-kilodalton zygote surface antigen and another two strains responded to the 48/45-kilodalton surface antigen. From two mouse strains, expressing between them five different class I MHC molecules, there was recognition of only a single CTL epitope from the CS protein, which was from a polymorphic segment of the molecule. The restricted CTL response to this protein parallels the restricted antibody response to this protein observed in humans and mice. These findings suggest that subunit malaria vaccines now being developed may be ineffective.\r"

No deterioration was shown in any measured cardiac parameter; mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, and right and left ventricular stroke work increased significantly (P less than .05). Further, there were no observed changes in arterial or venous oxygenation, or in venous admixture. Because of the uncertain effect of the head-down tilt position upon cerebral blood flow, the routine use of this position is not recommended for the treatment of hypotension or during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The results of this study, however, show that the cardiopulmonary effects are well tolerated if the position is required, as during central venous access procedures.\r"

A hemodynamic protocol was implemented that required maintaining colloid osmotic pressure above 17 millimeters of mercury, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure below 15 millimeters of mercury and the mean arterial pressure in a very narrow range throughout labor and delivery and for 48 hours postpartum. The initial colloid osmotic pressures and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were 18.0 +/- 2.6 and 10.5 +/- 4.0 millimeters of mercury, respectively, and remained essentially unchanged throughout the post partum period. The only benefit derived from volume expansion in these patients appeared to be the absence of acute fetal distress after the initiation of antihypertensive therapy. Six of 15 patients had late fetal stress develop during labor, suggesting that aggressive volume repletion and colloid osmotic pressure correction in pregnancy-induced hypertension does not effect the over-all incidence of fetal distress. We recommend that correction of colloid osmotic pressure be restricted to instances in which extremely low values (less than 12 millimeters of mercury) or a prolonged negative colloid osmotic pressure to pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient are identified. Finally, the benefit of volume expansion in pregnancy-induced hypertension appears to be the prevention of sudden and profound drops in blood pressure with antihypertensive therapy--not the prevention of fetal distress during labor.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with proximal stomas or high fistulas and defunctionalized intestine who are receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) often develop hepatic enzyme abnormalities and hyperbilirubinemia. A technique was developed to collect intestinal secretions from proximal stoma and to reinfuse these secretions into the distal part of the intestine. This technique was applied in eight patients with a disrupted intestinal tract. A significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in elevated serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels was observed. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels did not change significantly. The plasma sodium levels, slightly subnormal before reinfusion (131.0 +/- 4.6 millimolar per liter), despite enormous supplementation, normalized during reinfusion (137.0 +/- 4.0 millimolar per liter). TPN was continued during this infusion. This suggests that TPN by itself does not cause intrahepatic cholestasis. Neither could it be explained by an effect of secondary bile acids because these were most likely not produced as bile did not reach the distal defunctionalized intestine. Three possible mechanisms are suggested. Restoration of passage in the distal intestine may diminish bacterial overgrowth, endotoxin production and absorption. Enlargement of the bile acid pool may diminish the susceptibility of the liver to the deleterious effects of endotoxins. We advocate this reinfusion technique to overcome the metabolic disturbances occurring in those patients with high-output stomas or fistulas arising from the proximal parts of the small intestine.\r"

We looked for evidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and ASP. Prior to gastrostomy, the frequency of ASP was 29 of 87 patients. One year after gastrostomy, the crude frequency of ASP (17 of 52 patients) was not significantly improved. After gastrostomy, ASP was still observed in 18 of the 29 patients in whom ASP had been identified prior to gastrostomy. In the 58 patients in whom there was no clinical evidence of ASP prior to gastrostomy, 17 demonstrated ASP after gastrostomy. Over-all, 39 of 87 patients died. Mortality at one year (32) was greater in patients with documented ASP (p = 0.025). The preoperative presence of GER was associated with postoperative ASP (predictive value of 0.70). The preoperative presence of both GER and ASP was associated with postoperative ASP in all of the patients we studied.\r"

  ".W": "Gut malnutrition in patients with persistent hypermetabolism is hypothesized to be an important factor in postseptic multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). The hypothesis was made that enteral nutrition (EN) started at the onset of hypermetabolism could reduce the incidence of MOFS. Sixty-six patients with persistent hypermetabolism 4 to 6 days after onset of sepsis were prospectively randomized to receive either parenteral nutrition (PN) or enteral nutrition (EN) at 1.5 gm protein/kg/day and 30 nonprotein calories/kg/day; the EN and TPN were of the same composition. There was no reduction in either the incidence of MOFS or mortality attributable to the route of nutrition administration. The PN group tended to have better visceral protein support; the EN group had more gut complications. When analyzed, the type of formula given did have an effect on the nutritional outcome but not on the mortality rate. A formula with a nonprotein-calorie-to-nitrogen ratio of 100:1 was associated with more nitrogen retention, higher levels of visceral proteins, and better gut tolerance. The route of nutrition administration does not seem to affect the incidence of postseptic MOFS or mortality when hypermetabolism is already present and when commercially available nutritional formulas are used. The relationships among the route of nutrition, the type of enteral formula, and the disease process of hypermetabolism and MOFS appear to be complex and require much more investigation before the role of the gut and enteral nutrition can be defined.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation treatment may be less effective in the presence of bronchoconstriction because of the reduced penetration of drugs into the airways. The effect of bronchoconstriction on the lung deposition and plasma pharmacokinetics of inhaled sodium cromoglycate was examined. Ten subjects attended the laboratory on three occasions. On the first occasion a bronchial provocation test was performed to determine the concentration of methacholine required to reduce the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 20% (PC20). On the two subsequent occasions subjects inhaled either saline or their PC20 methacholine, followed five minutes later by an aerosol containing sodium cromoglycate and stannous phytate labelled with technetium-99m. Twenty minutes later a gamma emission lung scan was performed to determine the intrathoracic deposition of the nebulised aerosol. The central:peripheral (C:P) ratio of lung deposition was then calculated. Measurements of FEV1 were made and blood samples taken for analysis of plasma sodium cromoglycate concentration at intervals for four hours. Methacholine led to a 23.4% (SEM 0.6%) lower FEV1 and a 2.8 times higher C:P ratio than those observed after saline. There was a direct correlation between log PC20 methacholine and the increase in the C:P ratio (r = 0.81). Despite these changes with methacholine, the plasma pharmacokinetics of inhaled sodium cromoglycate were not significantly different after methacholine and after saline, except that the maximum concentration achieved (Cmax) was increased. These observations suggest that the area of cromoglycate deposition and the anatomical site are less important in determining the plasma pharmacokinetics of cromoglycate than is the total dose delivered to the lung.\r"

Significant interest has been generated at the health policy level regarding reimbursement for patients with complications and comorbidities. The purpose of this study was to analyze hospital resource consumption for patients in the seventeen urology non-complicating condition (CC) stratified Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs), currently 45 percent of urology DRGs. We analyzed 185 Medicare patients in these non-CC stratified urology DRGs and found that patients with more CCs per patient had higher total hospital costs per patient, financial risk under DRGs, a greater percentage of outliers, and a higher mortality, than patients in these same DRGs with fewer CCs per patient. These findings suggest that the current DRG system is inequitable to some patients and certain hospitals vis-a-vis non-CC stratified urology DRGs. The Health Care Financing Administration has not significantly changed the complicating condition urology DRG classification, as of its recent May, 1988 legislation. Financial disincentives to treat these patients may affect both their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

This study explores the role of age in resuscitation outcome by focusing on the CPR experience of all patients age 75 years and older in a community hospital during a one-year period. Data are based on a retrospective study of the medical records of 86 such patients. While 41 percent survived the initial resuscitation effort, only 23 percent regained conscious functioning, 12 percent left the hospital, and only 7 percent survived to be discharged from the hospital and were alive one year later. None of the 26 patients over the age of 85 survived resuscitation. Among the 75 to 84-year-old patients, the diagnosis of acute onset arrhythmia and dementia were associated with a better survival prognosis. Crude estimates of cost based on charges for crash carts, intensive care, and bed rates totalled over $100,000; over one-half the amount was allocated to the 21 patients who were unconscious before finally dying the hospital. The study suggests the importance of continuing discussion about quality of life and cost implications of resuscitation of elderly patients.\r"

The plasma ANP concentration significantly increased from 97.0 +/- 19.2 pg/ml to 107.6 +/- 23.7 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) during low-grade exercise (50% of the maximal heart rate) and from 96.2 +/- 16.5 pg to 192.8 +/- 30.7 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) during high-grade exercise (75% of the maximal heart rate). During high-grade exercise plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations showed significant increases. The plasma ANP concentration was significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.51; p less than 0.05). Patients with essential hypertension showed greater absolute increases in the plasma ANP concentration and systolic blood pressure during exercise compared to normotensive subjects. These results suggest that exercise stimulates secretion of ANP in response to its intensity in patients with essential hypertension and that a greater rise in atrial pressure, resulting from a greater elevation of systolic blood pressure, may be involved in the exaggerated secretion of ANP in patients with essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "1) Most humans, like other mammals, gradually lose the intestinal enzyme lactase after infancy and with it the ability to digest lactose, the principle sugar in milk. At some point in prehistory, a genetic mutation occurred and lactase activity persisted in a majority of the adult population of Northern and Central Europe. 2) Persistence of intestinal lactase, the uncommon trait worldwide, is inherited as a highly penetrant autosomal-dominant characteristic. Both types of progeny are almost equally common when one parent is a lactose maldigester and the other a lactose digester. 3) The incidence of lactose maldigestion is usually determined in adults by the administration in the fasting state of a 50-g dose of lactose in water, the equivalent of that in 1 L of milk. Measurement is made of either the subsequent rise in blood glucose or the appearance of additional hydrogen in the breath. It is also sometimes identified by measuring lactase activity directly in a biopsy sample from the jejunum. For children the test dose is reduced according to weight. Depending on the severity of the lactase deficiency and other factors, the test dose may result in abdominal distention, pain, and diarrhea. 4) The frequency of lactose maldigestion varies widely among populations but is high in nearly all but those of European origin. In North American adults lactose maldigestion is found in approximately 79% of Native Americans, 75% of blacks, 51% of Hispanics, and 21% of Caucasians. In Africa, Asia, and Latin America prevalence rates range from 15-100% depending on the population studied. 5) Whenever the lactose ingested exceeds the capacity of the intestinal lactase to split it into the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which are absorbed directly, it passes undigested to the large intestine. There it is fermented by the colonic flora, with short-chain fatty acids and hydrogen gas as major products. The gas produced can cause abdominal distention and pain and diarrhea may also result from the fermentation products. 6) Among individuals with incomplete lactose digestion, there is considerable variation in awareness of lactose intolerance and in the quantity of lactose that can be ingested without symptoms. A positive standard lactose test is not a reliable predictor of the ability of an individual to consume moderate amounts of milk and milk products without symptoms. In usual situations the quantity of lactose ingested at any one time is much less than in the lactose-tolerance test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All but one of the lesions in this series were solitary, and the flat bones (pelvis, rib, skull) were the most frequently involved sites. Radiographically, a well-defined, sometimes expansile lytic lesion, with either a small area of surrounding reactive bone or a distinct sclerotic margin, was seen. Microscopically, foam cells, giant cells, cholesterol clefts, and fibrosis were present in varying degrees. In none of these cases was there an identifiable underlying lesion. The differential diagnosis includes Erdheim-Chester disease (a multisystemic granulomatosis) and bone involvement in sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfman disease). More important is the differential diagnosis with metastatic clear cell carcinoma. Xanthoma of bone is a benign lesion, and complete or even partial removal is effective. Xanthomas may represent a \"burnt-out\" benign condition such as fibrous dysplasia or histiocytosis X.\r"

The comparison among the follow-up computerized tomography (CT) findings, the observation of the soft x-ray radiogram, and histopathologic studies of the surgical or autopsy materials revealed that the selective deposition of LIP in HCC lasted for a long term, particularly in cases treated by LIP combined with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). Also revealed was an extremely gradual decrease of LIP from the HCC. It was thus postulated that, mainly, the accumulated macrophages surrounding LIP around the necrotic cancer tissue and, partially, the intrahepatic lymphatic system itself contributed to this drainage. Further, in histologic sections with lipid staining, x-ray microanalysis proved that the lipid droplets in the cancer tissue included highly concentrated iodine, as a deposition of LIP.\r"

Tissue sections were pretreated briefly with trypsin, followed by DNase before the performance of the immunohistochemical reaction and cobalt chloride was used to intensify the color of the diaminobenzidine reaction product. In 20 cases, the results in paraffin sections were compared with biochemical assays with the dextran-coated charcoal technique or with immunohistochemistry performed on frozen sections. There was an excellent correlation between the results obtained with all three methods. The introduction of cobalt chloride into the chromogen solution significantly increased the sensitivity of this approach as compared with the use of diaminobenzidine alone.\r"

Growth velocity was slowed in all but one patient, and the rate of skeletal maturation was slowed even more, resulting in a stabilization or improvement in predicted adult height.

  ".W": "A series of human chromosome 3-specific DNA fragments isolated and characterized from a lamda phage genomic library were regionally localized on human chromosome 3. This was accomplished using filter hybridization blot analysis of a human chromosome 3 hybrid cell deletion mapping panel. Twenty-three new anonymous DNA fragments were assigned to one of four physical regions of chromosome 3. Seventeen DNA fragments were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 3, including one DNA fragment that demonstrated a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Five DNA fragments were assigned to 3p14.2----pter, including one highly polymorphic fragment sublocalized at 3p25----pter by in situ hybridization. This DNA fragment is the second reported distal 3p polymorphic probe. One DNA fragment was localized to 3p14----p14.2. In addition, three fragments previously assigned to chromosome 3 were confirmed. Polymorphic DNA probes DNF15S2 (formerly D1S1) and D3S2 were mapped to 3p14.2----pter. The previous 3p25 in situ localization of the c-raf-1 oncogene was supported by deletion panel mapping. The physical localization of these twenty-three new DNA fragments has more than doubled the number of cloned DNA fragments assigned to chromosome 3. These and future regional assignments of DNA fragment probes will facilitate construction of both a physical and genetic linkage map of chromosome 3. They may also be useful in characterizing the chromosomal and molecular aberrations involved in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), renal cell carcinoma, other malignancies, and the 3p14.2 common fragile site.\r"

Probes that recognize 14 novel RFLPs at loci designated D1S9-D1S22 were isolated from a flow-sorted chromosome 1 library. A linkage map of chromosome 1p was constructed from the genotypic data at these 14 loci, RFLPs at eight cloned genes (PND, ALPL, FUCA1, SRC2, MYCL, GLUT, TSHB, and NGFB), two previously identified RFLPs (D1S2 and D1S57), two blood group antigens (RH and FY), and the isozyme PGM1. All 27 loci form a continuous linkage group, from FY to PND, of 102 cM in males and 230 cM in females. This map provides a basis for highly informative multipoint mapping studies for most of the short arm of chromosome 1.\r"

In vitro assays demonstrated enhanced formation of both erythroid colonies and bursts following T-cell depletion. Erythroid colony formation was suppressed by the readdition of autologous T cells to a null cell fraction of marrow mononuclear cells. Media conditioned by the patients' T cells did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on erythroid colony formation by autologous T cell-depleted marrow cells. These in vitro results suggested that T cell-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis was responsible for the generation of pure red cell aplasia. In both patients, cyclophosphamide therapy resulted in clinical remissions manifested by normalization of the hematocrits associated with a reduction in circulating lymphocytes from more than 10,000/mm3 to under 500/mm3. Maintenance chemotherapy has caused persistent inhibition of lymphocyte counts along with durable remissions with normal hematocrits.\r"

  ".W": "To compare the clinical efficacy and dose equivalency of standard nifedipine versus a new gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of nifedipine, 98 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris participated in a 14-week, multicenter, open-label, crossover trial. All patients were administered nifedipine capsules for one month prior to study entry and continued receiving other antianginal, non-calcium blocker medications. Ninety-one patients (93 percent), 80 men and 11 women, mean age 62 +/- 1 years, completed the trial, which included two weeks receiving standard nifedipine followed by 12 weeks receiving nifedipine GITS starting at a dosage equal to the 24-hour total dose of nifedipine capsules and titrated upward as necessary. However, throughout the trial, mean nifedipine dosage was similar on nifedipine GITS compared with standard nifedipine. Angina frequency was significantly less with nifedipine GITS at Weeks 6, 10, and 14 (0.8 episodes/week) compared with baseline with standard nifedipine (1.3 episodes/week, p less than 0.05). Likewise, nitroglycerin consumption was also less at Weeks 6, 10, and 14, but only significantly less at Week 6 (nifedipine 1.2/week versus nifedipine GITS at six weeks, 0.7/week; p less than 0.05). Resting hemodynamic parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, were not significantly different with standard nifedipine versus nifedipine GITS during the 12-week study. Total incidences of side effects were similar for both treatments (standard nifedipine, 16; nifedipine GITS, 17). However, incidence of vasodilator side effects (flushing, dizziness, and light-headedness) was significantly less frequent with nifedipine GITS (standard nifedipine, 12; nifedipine GITS, six; p less than 0.05). Thus, results from this open-label, crossover trial suggest that nifedipine GITS dosing is similar to multidose standard nifedipine with equivalent 24-hour efficacy for nifedipine GITS.\r"

The normal women were studied in the early follicular phase of the cycle. Different concentrations of dopamine were maintained at each dose level for 2 hours. Blood samples were obtained every 15 minutes and concentrations of dopamine, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin quantified. Mean basal concentrations of estradiol were 53 +/- 19 pg/ml in the euprolactinemic and 33 +/- 12 pg/ml in the hyperprolactinemic women; mean prolactin levels were 8.1 +/- 3.9 ng/ml in euprolactinemic and 183 +/- 174 ng/ml in hyperprolactinemic women; mean basal dopamine concentrations were 323 +/- 308 pg/ml in euprolactinemic and 337 +/- 232 pg/ml in hyperprolactinemic women. All doses of dopamine achieved some degree of prolactin suppression, but doses that achieved nanomolar circulating concentrations did not significantly affect luteinizing hormone secretion. Eight of the women in each group exhibited high-amplitude luteinizing hormone pulses, which persisted during the dopamine infusions. Neither the amplitude nor frequency of luteinizing hormone release correlated with basal estradiol, luteinizing hormone, or prolactin levels. We conclude that low doses of dopamine infused into the peripheral circulation do not achieve significant suppression of luteinizing hormone release. In some women during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and in some amenorrheic hyperprolactinemic women, luteinizing hormone is secreted in a pulsatile manner characterized by high-amplitude low-frequency bursts. These bursts of luteinizing hormone were not influenced by elevations in circulating dopamine concentrations sufficient to suppress prolactin.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphoinositide hydrolysis is thought to be important in regulating a variety of intracellular signals, including Ca++ and prostaglandins, both of which have been implicated in the action of oxytocin during uterine smooth muscle contraction. We investigated the in vitro effect of oxytocin and various other uterotonic agents on phosphoinositide hydrolysis in gestational myometrium by measuring the production of inositol phosphates in tissue explants prelabeled with 3H-inositol. Oxytocin caused significant increases in all three inositol phosphates in myometrium at 3 minutes. Stimulation of inositol monophosphate production was sustained for 30 minutes and was dose dependent, with a half-maximal effect around 2 X 10(-8) mol/L. Platelet activating factor and alpha-adrenergic agonists also stimulated myometrial phosphoinositide hydrolysis, but carbachol prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha had no effect. Vasopressin had greater efficacy than oxytocin for stimulating hydrolysis in gestational myometrium. Furthermore, in contrast to vasopressin, oxytocin had no effect on inositol phosphate production in nongestational myometrium. Oxytocin also stimulated arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 and F2 alpha production in gestational myometrium. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol by myometrium homogenates showed a precursor-product relationship for the production of diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and arachidonic acid, indicative of a sequential action of phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase. These data demonstrate the potential for certain uterotonic agonists to use inositol lipid signaling to mobilize free arachidonic acid for prostaglandin production and to release intracellular Ca++ during excitation-contraction coupling.\r"

There was no significant difference between collagenase levels in the cervix and in the lower uterine segment in women not in labor and with the cervix closed. Levels of active and latent collagenase in 11 such specimens were 0.14 +/- 0.03 and 0.64 +/- 0.90 U/gm wet weight, respectively (mean +/- SEM; 1 U = 1 micrograms collagen digested per minute at 30 degrees C). Thirteen women at term in active labor with cervical dilation of 4 to 8 cm exhibited a thirteenfold increase in mean collagenase activity in the lower uterine segment. Active and latent collagenase increased to 2.06 +/- 0.92 and 8.64 +/- 2.87 U/gm, respectively.

Both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine incorporated 14C-arachidonic acid in proportion to their molar percent of total amnion phospholipids, but phosphatidylinositol incorporated three times as much 14C-arachidonic acid, suggesting either a rapid turnover in this specific phospholipid pool or a greater specificity for the transfer of arachidonoyl-coenzyme A to lysophosphatidylinositol. No or little competition of 14C-arachidonic acid incorporation into triacylglycerides or phospholipids occurred with palmitic acid, linoleic acid, or gamma-linolenic acid. However, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and unlabeled arachidonic acid were effective inhibitors. We conclude that the term amnion has high acyl transferase activity, that no change in the basal activity of this enzyme occurs with the onset of labor, and that a specific acyl transferase exists for 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids.\r"

Two proteoglycan fractions, large (CL-6B Kav 0.05) and small (Kav 0.25), that were not synthesized at detectable levels by cultures from rabbits infected with T. pallidum for 0 or 5 days, were produced by cultures from 10-, 15- and 20-day infected rabbits. The small proteoglycan appeared to be synthesized first because greater amounts of this fraction were detected in extracts of cultures from 10-day infected animals. The large proteoglycan fraction may have been induced directly by T. pallidum because increased synthesis correlated with maximal treponemal numbers, 15 days after infection. In contrast, the induction of the smaller proteoglycan did not appear to be directly related to numbers of elutable organisms. The proteoglycans synthesized between 10 and 20 days after infection were analyzed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) size and composition. The size of GAGs beta-eliminated from the proteoglycans generally increased over the 10-20-day infection period. Whereas the composition of the small proteoglycan fraction was largely unchanged during the 10-20-day period (45% chondroitin sulphate (CS), 55% dermatan sulphate (DS)), the amount of DS in the high molecular weight proteoglycan fraction decreased from 50-20% during this period (CS 50-80%). Autoradiography studies revealed that increased proteoglycan synthesis in T. pallidum-infected testes was localized to cells lining the seminiferous tubules and to fibroblasts infiltrating peritubular spaces.\r"

Eighty-three patients were found to have B cell phenotypes, and 20 patients had T cell phenotypes. Focusing on markers relevant to clinical outcome among B cell LCL showed that lack of expression of the pan B antigens Leu14 and Leu16 were correlated with decreased survival (Leu14, P = 0.01; Leu16, P = 0.06; log-rank). HLA-DR activity also showed that lack of expression of this antigen correlated with poor survival (P = 0.004, log-rank). Kappa light chain immunoglobulin lack of expression showed predictive value for decreased survival as well (P = 0.005, log-rank). Multivariate analyses of known clinically important variables and the immune phenotypes confirm that the loss of HLA-DR and B cell aberrancy are independent factors predicting a poor clinical outcome. Losing some B activation/kappa antigens appears to be a broad biologic phenomenon linking surface antigen lack of expression with decreased survival. This suggests that aberrancy of immunophenotype and immunoglobulin status are key predictors of survival in B-LCL.\r"

  ".W": "Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) were diagnosed in 43 patients from the Pittsburgh-Denver series between June 1980 and March 1987. This constitutes a detection rate of 1.7%. Major categories of clinical presentation included a mononucleosislike syndrome, gastrointestinal/abdominal disease, and solid organ disease. The median time of onset in patients initially immunosuppressed with cyclosporine-A (CsA)-containing regimens was 4.4 months after transplant, regardless of tumor clonality. A strong association of PTLD with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was observed. A histologic spectrum of lesions from polymorphic to monomorphic was observed. Whereas polymorphic lesions could be either clonal or nonclonal, monomorphic lesions appeared to be clonal in composition. The presence of large atypical cells (atypical immunoblasts) or necrosis did not appreciably worsen the prognosis. Twelve patients had clonal, 13 had nonclonal, and five had both clonal and nonclonal tumors. Clonality was indeterminate in 13 cases. Most patients were treated with a regimen based on reduced immunosuppression and supportive surgery. Almost all nonclonal and about half of the clonal lesions respond to this conservative therapy, indicating that it is an appropriate first line of treatment. This behavior suggests that a spectrum of lesions ranging from infectious mononucleosis to malignant lymphoma constitutes the entity known as PTLD. Some monoclonal tumors can undergo regression, however, apparently in response to host immune control mechanisms. Because of its short latency and strong association with EBV, PTLD is an important model for the study of virus-associated tumor progression in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The synthesis of prostaglandin, prostacyclin, and thromboxane, which requires the enzyme prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase (cyclooxygenase), is a general property of histiocytes, monocytes, and Langerhans cells. Previously the authors reported the production of prostaglandin E2 in a Hodgkin's cell line, KM-H2, and suggested that these cells therefore have a functional similarity to histiocyte-related cells. The present study confirms that the Hodgkin's neoplastic (Reed-Sternberg, H-RS) cells in tissue are also capable of producing prostaglandins by demonstrating the presence of PGH synthase in these cells in B5-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. It was found that the H-RS cells from seven of ten patients with Hodgkin's disease were stained variously with anti-PGH synthase antibodies. In normal and reactive lymphoid tissues, anti-PGH synthase staining was restricted to histiocytes, endothelial cells, and interdigitating reticulum cells. Thus, this study provides further evidence for a possible relationship between H-RS cells and histiocytes or interdigitating reticulum cells; this relationship has also been supported by information obtained in extensive immunologic, biochemical, and cell-differentiation studies. The secretion of PGH-synthase products, especially prostaglandin E2, in H-RS cells may play a major role in the regulation of cellular immunity in patients with Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "The tumor microvasculature is hyperpermeable to plasma proteins, but the specific vessels that leak have not been identified. To investigate this question, the extravasation of circulating tracers of varying size was studied by fluorescence, light, and electron microscopy in animals bearing solid transplantable carcinomas. In all five tumors studied, 70 and 150 kD fluoresceinated (FITC)-dextrans and colloidal carbon leaked extensively from the prominent vascular plexus that was induced around individual tumor nodules and at the tumor-host interface. Leaky vessels were mature veins or venules, lined by a continuous endothelium; most had closed interendothelial cell junctions. Immature interface vessels and tumor-penetrating vessels did not leak these macromolecular tracers significantly. Three kD of FITC-dextran leaked from peripherally situated tumor veins or venules but also extravasated from tumor-penetrating vessels and capillaries supplying normal tissues. These data correlate the functional and anatomic heterogeneity of tumor vessels and provide a rationale for the distribution of circulating molecules such as monoclonal antibodies and tumoricidal drugs in solid tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We used cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the health and economic implications of exercise in preventing coronary heart disease (CHD). We assumed that nonexercisers have a relative risk of 2.0 for a CHD event. Two hypothetical cohorts (one with exercise and the other without exercise) of 1,000 35-year-old men were followed for 30 years to observe differences in the number of CHD events, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy. We used jogging as an example to calculate cost, injury rates, adherence, and the value of time spent. Both direct and indirect costs associated with exercise, injury, and treating CHD were considered. We estimate that exercising regularly results in 78.1 fewer CHD events and 1,138.3 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained over the 30-year study period. Under our base case assumptions, which include indirect costs such as time spent in exercise, exercise does not produce economic savings. However, the cost per QALY gained of $11,313 is favorable when compared with other preventive or therapeutic interventions for CHD. The value of time spent is a crucial factor, influencing whether exercise is a cost-saving activity. In an alternative model, where all members of the cohort exercise for one year, and then only those who like it or are neutral continue, exercise produces net economic savings as well as reducing morbidity.\r"

These antibody preparations were used in culture to demonstrate the presence of anti-idiotypic T lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations from patients with either schistosomiasis mansoni or Chagas' disease, or with both of these infections. Only cells from patients with schistosomiasis or both infections proliferated upon exposure to the anti-SEA antibodies. Conversely, only cells from patients with Chagas' disease or both infections responded to anti-epimastigote antibodies. Western blot analysis of SEA and epimastigote antigens, developed by patients' sera or by immunoaffinity-purified antibody preparations, substantiated that anti-SEA immunoaffinity-purified antibodies only reacted with components of SEA, and anti-epimastigote immunoaffinity-purified antibodies only reacted with components of epimastigote antigenic preparation. These studies demonstrate the presence of anti-idiotypic T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with schistosomiasis or Chagas' disease which are specific for idiotypes generated during these infections.\r"

Prior to treatment, 69% of the children examined (ages 4-21, n = 2,628) were infected; 34% had moderate or heavy infections (greater than 100 eggs/10 ml urine). Infected individuals were randomized to receive, during one year, either metrifonate (10 mg/kg x 3 doses) or praziquantel, (40 mg/kg x 1 dose). At the end of the first year, prevalence of infection fell to 19%; only 2% of the pupils remained in the moderately and heavily infected groups. Corresponding decreases in the prevalence of hematuria (54% in 1984 vs. 16% in 1985) and proteinuria (56% in 1984 vs. 26% in 1985) were noted. These were associated with significant declines in bladder thickening and irregularities noted during ultrasound examinations, but not with decreases in hydronephrosis. There was no significant difference in the post-treatment prevalence or intensity of infection after treatment with metrifonate as compared with praziquantel. These results demonstrate that field-applied chemotherapy with either agent offers a practical strategy for the control of S. haematobium infection and its associated morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of alfentanil was studied in three healthy subjects after a 1-h infusion of 2.5 mg alfentanil-3H. One of the subjects was a poor hydroxylator of debrisoquine. Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar in the three subjects and were in the same range as those reported for volunteers. The majority of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine (90% of the dose), but unchanged alfentanil represented only 0.16-0.47% of the dose. Alfentanil and metabolites were characterized by HPLC co-chromatography with reference compounds and/or by mass spectrometry and quantified by GLC and radio-HPLC. The main metabolic pathway was N-dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen, with formation of noralfentanil (30% of the dose). Other Phase I pathways were aromatic hydroxylation, N-dealkylation of the piperidine ring from the phenylpropanamide nitrogen, O-demethylation, and amide hydrolysis followed by N-acetylation. Glucuronic acid conjugation of aromatic or aliphatic hydroxyl functions was the main Phase II pathway. The second major metabolite was the glucuronide of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanamide (14% of the dose). The metabolite pattern in these subjects was qualitatively very similar to that described previously in rats and dogs. Differences in the mass balance of urinary metabolites between the three subjects were very small, and there was no qualitative or quantitative evidence for a deficiency in the metabolism of alfentanil in the subject who was a poor metabolizer of debrisoquine.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to investigate whether the metabolism of the opiate analgesic alfentanil in humans is subject to the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation polymorphism. The role of a specific cytochrome P-450 form, debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase, in the metabolism of alfentanil was investigated by competitive inhibition experiments over the concentration range 4-100 microM. Alfentanil was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. Alfentanil and its major metabolites were quantified in the incubates by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alfentanil was rapidly metabolized, yielding noralfentanil as the main metabolite. Kinetically, alfentanil metabolism occurred monophasically and the kinetic parameters were 22.8 microM for Km app and 3.86 nmol alfentanil metabolized min-1.mg protein-1 for Vm app. Debrisoquine was a weak, noncompetitive inhibitor of alfentanil metabolism and of the formation of its major metabolites, with Ki values between 2.00 and 3.21 mM. It can be concluded that alfentanil is not metabolized in vitro by the human cytochrome P-450 form involved in debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation; therefore, the in vivo disposition of the drug is most likely not affected by deficiency of this enzyme.\r"

Blood-brain barrier damage and increased intra-blood-brain barrier IgG synthesis were detected in 5 of the 7 patients with HSVE. CSF oligoclonal bands were found in 6 of 11 patients. Using an IEF-overlay technique, we detected anti-gB antibody in all serum (7 of 7) and in 10 of 12 CSF samples. Anti-gB antibody was found in 4 of 6 CSF specimens obtained within the first week of disease (days 3 to 5) and in all samples collected later in the disease. The pH range of anti-gB antibody activity was broad (4.5 to 9.5), indicating a heterogeneous immune response to HSV. A hematogenous origin of the CSF antibody was suggested because anti-gB antibody appeared in serum before matched CSF and because both serum and matched CSF had a similar antibody IEF pattern. Local production of anti-gB antibody was suggested in some cases because of a greater prominence of anti-gB antibody in CSF than in matched sera and because CSF oligoclonal bands had anti-gB antibody activity. In contrast, only one of 6 CSF samples from patients with multiple sclerosis had gB antibody activity; in this case, anti-gB antibody activity did not correspond in isoelectric point location to oligoclonal bands.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hyperventilation, which occurs in some patients with severe mental handicap, is a prominent feature in the histories of most girls with Rett syndrome but its mechanism and effects have not been established. Respiratory function was therefore studied in 18 patients with Rett syndrome and 23 healthy controls. Ten of the patients (56%), but none of the controls, hyperventilated only when awake, and began doing so after a period of normal breathing without hypoxaemia. After hyperventilation was established it was interspersed with prolonged periods of apnoea (over 19 seconds) accompanied by Valsalva manoeuvres. Hypoxaemia (less than 90%) occurred in 47% of these periods of apnoea and five (50%) of the patients had oxygen saturation values of under 50%. During hyperventilation severe hypocapnia developed in every patient, and recorded arterial pH measurements ranged from 7.47 to 7.60. A further four patients (22%) did not hyperventilate, but had clear histories of hyperventilation when younger. All had frequent apnoeic pauses accompanied by Valsalva manoeuvres. The remaining four girls (22%) neither hyperventilated nor gave a clear history of doing so. Three had occasional apnoeic pauses associated with the Valsalva manoeuvres. All but one of the 18 patients had increased quantities of periodic apnoea compared with the control subjects. The hypocapnic alkalaemia and hypoxaemia resulting from hyperventilation may contribute to the cerebral impairment in Rett syndrome. Since the hyperventilation is 'primary', and not secondary to preceding apnoea, it is potentially treatable. Further studies will determine if treatment is practical and of benefit.\r"

After an oral dose, the three hour urinary mannitol: lactulose ratios in the control group showed a highly significant positive correlation with body surface area. After correction for the body surface area relationship, a control lower limit was defined by the mean -2SD of the log10 transformed control mannitol: lactulose ratios. Specificity and sensitivity for severe villous atrophy was 98% and 95% respectively but the sensitivity declined rapidly with decreasing degrees of mucosal damage, and the test would not therefore be an adequate screening procedure for all enteropathies. In sequential studies in 18 children, the changes in the mannitol: lactulose ratio were consistent with the changes in mucosal structure induced by gluten challenge or gluten withdrawal. The test may therefore have a role in any sequential study of lesions of the mucosa of the small intestine.\r"

We studied clinical and metabolic responses in eleven tumor-bearing humans with normal renal and hepatic function receiving bolus intravenous (I.V.) interleukin-2 (30,000 U/kg). Additional subjects (n = 6) were pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen (1600 mg, orally), before interleukin-2 administration. Serial measurements were made of vital signs, symptoms, hematology, and plasma concentrations of pituitary and stress hormones and selected cytokines. Administration of interleukin-2 resulted in fever, tachyacardia, \"flu-like\" symptoms, and neurohormonal elaboration. The responses observed were quantitatively similar to those that occurred after endotoxin administration in healthy subjects (n = 13), but differed in the following manner: 1) the onset of fever and endocrine changes occurred after a longer latent interval (180-240 minutes vs. 60-90 minutes after endotoxin), 2) peak responses after the administration of interleukin-2 also occurred later, 3) no increased circulating tumor necrosis factor was detected after administration of interleukin-2 (peak plasma concentration was greater than 35 pg/ml vs. 270 +/- 70 pg/ml after endotoxin administration), and 4) administration of interleukin-2 but not of endotoxin was associated with increased circulating concentrations of gamma interferon (peak plasma concentration 1.7 +/- 0.2 NIH U/ml vs. less than 0.1 NIH U/ml after endotoxin administration). Fever and neurohormonal responses after interleukin-2 administration were greatly attenuated by ibuprofen administration. Interleukin-2 induces other cytokines that exert their effects largely through the cyclooxygenase pathway. Interleukin-2 may be an important signal, initiating the integrated host responses to infection and injury.\r"

  ".W": "Arginine enhances immune function and promotes nitrogen retention in animal models, but its immunomodulatory effects in surgical patients are unknown. This randomized, prospective trial evaluated the immune and metabolic effects of supplemental L-arginine (25 g/day, n = 16) or isonitrogenous L-glycine (43 g/day, n = 14) in 30 cancer patients undergoing major operation. Two groups of patients received either arginine or glycine for 7 days after surgery as a supplement to a graduated enteral diet. Nitrogen balance was measured daily, and immune parameters were determined both before and after surgery, on Days 1, 4, and 7. The T-lymphocyte response to concanavalin A (con A) and PHA and dual marker phenotype analysis of lymphocyte (CD2, CD4, CD4/DR, CD8, CD8/DR) and macrophage (M3/DR) subsets were determined. Mean age, degree of preoperative weight loss, disease stage, number of perioperative transfusions, and calorie and nitrogen intake were similar for the groups studied. Mean daily nitrogen balance (-2.3 g/day in the arginine group vs. -3.9 g/day in the glycine group) was not significantly different between the two groups, but positive mean nitrogen balance was achieved only in the arginine group between Days 5 and 7 after surgery. Supplemental arginine significantly enhanced the mean T-lymphocyte response (stimulation index) to con A from 45 +/- 26 on postoperative Day 1 to 72 +/- 47 and 87 +/- 49 on postoperative Days 4 and 7, compared with the values of 29 +/- 15, 27 +/- 20, and 33 +/- 34 in the glycine group at the same time points, respectively. Supplemental arginine increased mean CD4 phenotype (% T-cells) on postoperative Days 1 and 7 from 25 +/- 9 to 43 +/- 14, compared with the values of 30 +/- 14 and 29 +/- 13 in the glycine group (p less than 0.05). The beneficial effect of arginine on the immune system appeared distinct from its more moderate effect on nitrogen metabolism. As a nutrient substrate, arginine was nontoxic, and may benefit surgical patients who are at increased risk of infection.\r"

  ".W": "The effect that a 14-day treatment program of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) combined with the glutamine antimetabolite, acivicin, and anabolic hormone, insulin, has on carcass weight and muscle sparing was investigated in tumor-bearing rats. Although TPN resulted in increased carcass weight gain as compared to chow-fed tumor-bearing rats, no savings in gastrocnemius muscle could be demonstrated. The combination of TPN with daily insulin treatment elicited significant increases in both carcass weight and muscle savings, with no alteration in tumor growth. Although combining acivicin with TPN halted tumor growth and increased carcass weight, the change in carcass weight was less than that observed with the insulin-TPN combination. No muscle savings were observed in the acivicin-TPN-treated rats. Yet when acivicin and insulin were combined with TPN, tumor growth was stopped, carcass weight was gained, and muscle mass was saved. Therefore, these experiments suggest that it is possible to add lean body tissue and stabilize tumor growth in rats that receive TPN through anabolic hormone treatment combined with an inhibitor of tumor metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Severe cardiac allograft rejection remains a serious problem despite the advances of cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. This study analyzes our experience with 202 recipients of cardiac allografts who were treated primarily with cyclosporine and prednisone. Failure of such therapy in 86 patients (43%) resulted in 105 episodes of advanced cardiac allograft rejection as diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. Of 101 rejection episodes that were initially treated with intravenous pulse therapy, 48 (48%) were successfully resolved, yet 60% of these successes were associated with major infections. Patients in whom steroid therapy failed or was contra-indicated received intravenous antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or intravenous monoclonal antibody (OKT3). ATG and OKT3 successfully reversed severe rejection in 26 (81%) of 32 and in 13 (93%) of 14 episodes, respectively. Infectious complication rates were 54% and 21%, respectively. Because the majority (87%) of these rejection episodes occurred within the first 30 days after treatment, many of them may have resulted from inadequate immunosuppressive induction therapy. Based on our results, we believe that advanced cardiac allograft rejection may be managed best by individualizing immunosuppressive therapy, thus enhancing prevention, and by adding OKT3 to the regimen when rejection occurs.\r"

These measurements serve as objective, reproducible indices of exercise capacity that can be applied to the management of various clinical problems. In addition, by permitting simultaneous assessment of circulatory and ventilatory reserves, the test can be especially helpful in the differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea and fatigue. This paper reviews the physiology of gas exchange, the limitations of standard exercise tests, and the methodology and clinical applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing.\r"

Two new systems of classification during the past two decades are intended for other purposes and would not be satisfactory as nosologic substitutes. The Problem-Oriented Record (POR) does not have a standardized nomenclature or criteria; and the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) approach was organized mainly for fiscal goals. As the basic taxonomy used for classifying human ailments, the ICD needs substantial improvement to fulfill its scientific role in statistics for the occurrence and treatment of disease.\r"

Initial treatment consisted of 12 weeks of full-dose H2-receptor antagonist therapy. During this therapy the patient developed multiple gastric ulcers confirmed by endoscopy, and continued to have significant dyspeptic symptoms. An additional 16 weeks of combination therapy with ranitidine and sucralfate failed to ameliorate upper gastrointestinal symptoms, and there was significant increase in gastric ulcer size. Repeated ulcer biopsies showed no malignancy. Prior to scheduling elective gastric ulcer surgery, a trial of oral prostaglandin E1 analogue therapy was initiated with an investigational agent. Within the first three weeks of therapy, there was significant symptomatic improvement. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract at 12 weeks revealed complete ulcer healing. This case report suggests that prostaglandin E1 analogue therapy should be considered as an alternative to elective gastric ulcer surgery for patients with refractory gastric ulcer.\r"

This communication simulates DRG-based payments for psychiatric admissions to general hospitals under the PPS and also under a modified version of the PPS. Two major types of modifications are made: (1) an increase in the role of outlier payments and (2) a restructuring of the DRG classification to allow for a difference in the basic payment rate, depending on whether or not care is provided in a facility that is currently exempt. When compared with cost data from just before the start of the PPS, the simulation results show the degree to which these hypothetical modifications will decrease the systematic risk of general hospitals with exempt units from receiving payments that fall short of costs.\r"

  ".W": "Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic neoplasms has in the past been considered extremely uncommon. The histologic neuroendocrine patterns reported previously vary from small cell to carcinoidlike to mixed adenocarcinoma--small cell or carcinoid. The majority of the tumors reported are of the mixed variety. We reviewed 2648 autopsies, revealing 69 prostatic carcinomas, eight with neuroendocrine differentiation (five mixed adenocarcinoma--small-cell carcinoma, two \"pure\" small cell, and one \"pure\" carcinoidlike). The mean patient age was 69.5 years. One patient presented with markedly elevated serum corticotropin and another was severely hypercalcemic with elevated serum parathyroid hormone level. Three neoplasms were incidental autopsy findings. The mean survival time, after diagnosis, was 19 months for the other patients. Three of the cases were examined ultrastructurally and showed cytoplasmic processes containing membrane-bound granules in the neuroendocrine component. The areas with neuroendocrine differentiation were positive for markers as follows: neuron-specific enolase, seven of eight; prostate-specific antigen (PSA), none of eight; chromogranin A, seven of eight; synaptophysin, four of eight; and calcitonin, four of eight. Those neoplasms mixed with an adenocarcinoma component showed well-defined PSA positivity in the glandular elements. This study suggests that neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic neoplasms may be more common than previously thought. Often, the areas with neuroendocrine differentiation are considered to represent poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. It is important to recognize neuroendocrine components in prostatic carcinomas owing to prognostic and potential therapeutic implications.\r"

They consisted of amorphous, electron-dense granules that formed discontinuous layers adjacent to the plasma membranes of cardiac myocytes, arteriolar endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, and neural elements. These observations underscore the need for critical study of endomyocardial biopsy specimens, using electron microscopy and immunohistochemical reagents, for the precise identification of protein components in tissue deposits in patients suspected of having cardiac amyloidosis or related disorders.\r"

Three abnormal patterns were identified as follows: (1) relative deficiency of a peptide with a relative molecular mass of approximately 58 kilodaltons (four patients); (2) relative decrease in the ratio of alpha-2 to alpha-1 (I) CB peptides (seven patients); and (3) decreased detection of all collagenous CB and pepsin cleavage products (one patient, who was also heterozygous for the Z allele of alpha 1-antitrypsin). The \"minimal hypothesis\" to explain these findings is that most of the observed abnormalities can be explained by collagenolysis in vitro, although a mutation in the primary structure of collagen has not been ruled out in all patients. Molecular heterogeneity appears to occur within the aneurysm phenotype, and the findings in the patient in group 3 allow identification of one possible risk factor in abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease that has a genomic assignment.\r"

Time from symptom onset to treatment was one to 28 days (mean, 11 days). Five infusions (21%) were completely successful since symptoms were eliminated without subsequent operation. Seven infusions (29%) were partially successful since thrombolysis aided, limited, or postponed subsequent surgery. Six infusions (25%) were failures since thrombolysis or clinical improvement did not occur and surgery was required. Six infusions (25%) were associated with thrombolytic complications that required urgent operation (less severe complications occurred in an additional 17% of cases [4/24]). Of the 19 patients without complete success after thrombolytic therapy, 16 underwent surgery during the same admission, two were not operable due to distal disease, and one declined operation. Of the 16 operations, 15 (94%) were successful in restoring graft or artery patency and achieving limb salvage, whereas one failed. In the 12 patients with failure or major complications of thrombolytic treatment, all had successful surgical outcome without morbidity. The actual mean cost of thrombolytic treatment was $8200 per patient and was comparable with the actual mean cost of subsequent surgical treatment in the 16 patients who required operation ($8900 per patient). The effective cost of thrombolytic and surgical treatment was calculated by dividing the actual costs by the proportion of successful cases. The effective cost of thrombolytic therapy per complete success was $39,200 and per complete or partial success was $16,500. This was significantly more than the effective cost of $9400 per complete success of surgical therapy.\r"

Trauma resulted in immediate and profound depression of both interferon gamma production and monocyte HLA-DR antigen expression compared with controls. Interferon gamma remained below control levels for all days on which it was measured in all patients. In uninfected patients, interferon gamma production began to recover after day 7 and interferon gamma levels on day 21 were greater than on all other days. Monocyte HLA-DR antigen expression returned to normal between days 7 and 14 in uninfected patients, despite subnormal production of interferon gamma. Failure to increase interferon gamma production and monocyte HLA-DR antigen expression was associated with an episode of major infection. We postulate that stimulation of the immune system early after injury may reverse the defects reported and decrease the incidence of infection after severe trauma.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we assessed intestinal permeability with the nonmetabolizable, poorly absorbed disaccharide lactulose, which is efficiently excluded by the normal intestinal mucosa. Permeability studies were performed in 15 burned patients (aged 18 to 67 years; mean burn size, 40%) and 11 healthy controls. Lactulose, 10 g, was administered enterally, together with 5 g of mannitol as a control, and urinary excretion rates were determined. Lactulose excretion and the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio increased threefold (160 +/- 30 vs 57 +/- 7 mumol and 0.113 +/- 0.033 vs 0.035 +/- 0.005) in the infected patients (sepsis score, 10 +/- 2; burn size, 38% +/- 6%). In contrast, noninfected burn patients (sepsis score, 0) had permeability values similar to those of controls (66 +/- 10 mumol and 0.036 +/- 0.007). Permeability increased as the severity of infection increased. Infection in burn patients is associated with increased bowel permeability. The intestine may be a primary source of sepsis. Alternatively, the systemic response to infection may alter gut barrier function, which could facilitate translocation of bacteria and absorption of endotoxin.\r"

A pooled worldwide review of 5258 cases from several clinical protocols for treatment of acute myocardial infarction, using tissue plasminogen activator from one source, revealed a similar overall incidence of 0.68%. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage may be reduced by lowering the total dose of tissue plasminogen activator or by reducing the infusion rate and duration. The incidence of central nervous system hemorrhage with tissue plasminogen activator is within the range reported with streptokinase, but because equal coronary artery thrombolytic doses are not known, no definitive comparison is possible.\r"

At five hours after inoculation, ciprofloxacin (3 mg/mL) therapy was initiated (one drop every 30 minutes for 12 hours). Corneal tissue was then excised for bacterial colony counts. No organisms were recovered from ciprofloxacin-treated eyes, compared with an average of 3.1 X 10(7) organisms per milliliter recovered from untreated controls.

The clones derived from single cells were expanded in vitro and examined (in passages C-H) for growth and synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagenase-sensitive protein (CSP). The clonogenicity of PSS fibroblasts was not significantly different from that of normal fibroblasts. Normal fibroblast clones were characterized by low levels of GAG and CSP synthesis, and there was a correlation between the GAG and CSP phenotypes. In contrast, clones of PSS fibroblasts were often, but not always, high producers of GAG and CSP, but there was no correlation between the levels of GAG and CSP synthesis. It appears that scleroderma skin is composed of fibroblast clones that are unable to regulate the synthesis of connective tissue components and often synthesize large amounts of connective tissue macromolecules.\r"

Gold sodium thiomalate (GST) inhibited both basal and interleukin-1-induced tritiated thymidine incorporation into fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Significant inhibition was observed at the level of 5 micrograms/ml GST, and greater than 50% inhibition was attained at 10 micrograms/ml. These concentrations are attainable in the serum of treated patients. Similar inhibition was observed when less than 1 micrograms/ml auranofin, which is also within a serum-attainable range, was added. Low concentrations of GST (0-10 micrograms/ml) did not affect interleukin-1 secretion from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human mononuclear phagocytes (M phi) when assessed by both human fibroblast and C3H/HeJ mouse thymocyte proliferation assays. When M phi precultured for 48 hours with GST (0-10 micrograms/ml) were added to the fibroblast culture in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide, there was no significant inhibition of M phi-induced DNA synthesis of fibroblasts. In contrast, when fibroblasts were precultured with GST (0-10 micrograms/ml) for 48 hours and freshly separated M phi were added, significant inhibition was observed in M phi-induced fibroblast proliferation at 5 micrograms/ml. These results suggest that low concentrations of GST directly cause a reduction of fibroblast proliferation, but do not affect the capability of M phi for induction of fibroblast proliferation. Therefore, gold compounds may play a role in the inhibition of the growth of rheumatoid pannus by direct inhibition of fibroblast proliferation.\r"

We report here that recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor beta (lymphotoxin), interleukin-1 alpha, and interleukin-1 beta stimulate the hyaluronic acid (HA) levels of human synovial fibroblast-like cells. The effect of monokines was generally inhibited by indomethacin, suggesting the involvement of an endogenous cyclooxygenase product in the stimulation, and by the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. In contrast, all-trans-retinoic acid stimulated synovial cell plasminogen activator activity but did not increase the HA levels. These findings could help to explain the raised HA levels found in the joint fluids and in the circulation of patients with rheumatic disease.\r"

Compared with controls, the gamma-IFN-treated mice developed arthritis with a higher frequency and severity. Immunohistochemical analysis of gamma-IFN-treated paws from CII-immunized mice revealed an increase in the numbers of class II antigen-expressing cells and an infiltration of CD4+ lymphocyte-like cells. The auto-antibody response toward CII was suppressed by gamma-IFN treatment.

  ".W": "In Africa, female prostitutes represent a high risk group for HIV infection. In Kinshasa, Zaire, 101 (27%) out of 377 prostitutes were seropositive to HIV by ELISA and Western blot determination. Seropositivity was significantly associated with the number of lifetime partners with a median number of 600 partners, four seropositives and 338 for seronegative individuals (P = 0.02). Seropositivity was also significantly associated with a history of taking oral medications for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and/or pregnancy (odds ratio = 2.21, confidence interval = 1.2-4.2), and with the introduction of any product into the vagina for hygiene or other purposes (odds ratio = 2.3, confidence interval = 1.1-4.7). In addition, among 85 prostitutes reporting condom use by their sexual partners during the previous year, the use of condoms by 50% or more of partners was associated with a reduced risk of HIV seropositivity (P = 0.046). An increased risk of HIV seropositivity was not associated with fellatio, anal intercourse, or with any type of kissing. Twenty-nine per cent of prostitutes reported at least one symptom suggestive of HIV infection, and seropositivity was associated with weight loss, either with or without chronic diarrhea or pruritic dermatitis. These data confirm that African prostitutes are at high risk for HIV infection and that the number of lifetime sexual partners, and factors which interfere with the integrity of the vaginal or cervical mucosa, may be associated with an increased risk of HIV infection acquired through heterosexual contact.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Before commencing rational control programmes for AIDS in Africa it is desirable to determine the relative importance of heterosexual and various non-sexual modes of transmission. We investigated this by comparing the seroepidemiologies of AIDS, hepatitis B and syphilis at two rural hospitals in southwest Uganda. During August 1986, 3% of 357 outpatients, reflecting the age and sex composition of the general population, were anti-HIV positive. Anti-HIV seropositivity, both in the outpatients and among 36 suspected prostitutes and 14 suspected AIDS cases, was confined to individuals aged 20 or over. For men, seropositivity was associated with sexual contact with prostitutes (a risk factor for 61% of young men in the study). In the prostitute group, 25% were anti-HIV positive and 46% were positive on the Treponema pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA) test for syphilis. The risk factors for HIV, but not hepatitis B, were the same as for having a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD). However, there was, surprisingly, an association between a history of STD and seropositivity for hepatitis B virus but not for HIV infection. The geographical and age distributions of seropositivity for HIV and hepatitis B virus were also quite different. Finally, blood transfusions, scarification and exposure to mosquitoes (as assessed by a history of malaria) were not evident risk factors for either HIV or hepatitis B virus. AIDS in rural Africa seems to differ in its epidemiology from hepatitis B and appears to be spread predominantly by pre-existing patterns of heterosexual activity responsible for high rates of other sexually transmitted diseases.\r"

Sera were simultaneously tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and to HIV-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and were confirmed by specific Western blot. A spot test using synthetic peptides was also applied when a sample was reactive by ELISA HIV-1 and HIV-2 and was confirmed as HIV-1 by Western blot. A total of 30 blood donors were confirmed as HIV-1 positive (0.030%) and no sample was confirmed as HIV-2 positive. In the selected population, the prevalence of HIV-infected people was 7.1% for HIV-1 and 0.09% for HIV-2. Eight of the nine HIV-2 cases were directly or indirectly connected to West Africa. Only one HIV-2 case had no known contact with these countries; he has been transfused and is under investigation. Except for this possible HIV-2 infection in a blood recipient, no HIV-2 seropositivity was found in at-risk groups (homosexuals, drug addicts and haemophiliacs). At present, HIV-2 does not seem to be widely spread in France. Seroepidemiological surveillance will be continued.\r"

To determine the incidence of bacterial pneumonia in a well defined population of intravenous drug users (IVDUs), and to examine any association with HIV infection, we prospectively studied 433 IVDUs without AIDS, enrolled in a longitudinal study of HIV infection in an out-patient methadone maintenance program. At enrollment, 144 (33.3%) subjects were HIV-seropositive, 289 (66.7%) were seronegative. Over a 12-month period, 14 out of 144 (9.7%) seropositive subjects were hospitalized for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, compared with six out of 289 (2.1%) seronegative subjects. The cumulative yearly incidence of bacterial pneumonia was 97 out of 1000 for seropositives and 21 out of 1000 for seronegatives (risk ratio = 4.7, P less than 0.001). Eleven out of 14 (78.6%) cases among the seropositive patients were due to either Streptococcus pneumoniae [5] or Hemophilus influenzae [6]. Two out of 14 (14.3%) cases among the seropositives were fatal. Stratifying by level of intravenous drug use indicated that even among subjects not reporting active intravenous drug use at study entry, eight out of 82 (9.8%) seropositives compared with three out of 211 (1.4%) seronegatives were hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia over the study period (risk ratio = 6.9, P less than 0.01). This study shows a markedly increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia associated with HIV infection in IVDUs without AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clinical symptoms were only seen in infants or children who were or had been positive for IgM and/or IgA, but only 39% of children positive for these markers have developed disease so far. Clinical symptoms combined with signs of immunodeficiency were seen only in children who were isolation-positive or had evidence of HIV-reactive IgA or child-produced IgG. Absorption studies showed that Western blot-detected IgM and IgA antibodies were of two types: 42% were directed against various HIV proteins, while the rest represented rheumatoid-factor-like IgM or IgA binding to HIV-specific IgG. HIV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in all samples up to the age of 12 months and were still found in 83% of infants 13-18 months old. We observed weak HIV-specific IgG above the age of 15 months with no other signs of HIV infection, suggesting that the demonstration of antibodies in children beyond this age does not necessarily indicate HIV infection.\r"

All ELISA-positive sera were tested by Western blot analysis and many of them also by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). Sixty-seven sera were confirmed positive. Eight sera, which were repeatedly positive on only one or two of the ELISA kits and showed weak, doubtful reactions on Western blot and RIPA, were considered indeterminate and were not included in the calculations of sensitivity and specificity of the various ELISA kits. The sensitivity of the ELISAs was as follows: Organon Vironostika: low cut-off 74.6%; Organon Vironostika: high cut-off 62.7%; Du Pont: 85.1%; Pasteur: 78.7%; Abbott: 80.8%; Abbott recombinant: 94.0%; Wellcozyme: 82.1%; Wellcozyme monoclonal: 98.5%. The specificity was as follows: Organon Vironostika: low and high cut-off 100%; Du Pont: 94.7%; Pasteur: 99.3%; Abbott: 100%; Abbott recombinant 98.7%; Wellcozyme: 99.8%; Wellcozyme monoclonal: 98.5%. In conclusion, the two new generation kits tested, Wellcozyme monoclonal and Abbott recombinant, had the highest sensitivity whereas the sensitivity of the first-generation tests was unexpectedly low.\r"

We studied 22 subjects with persistent and isolated anti-core reactivities; 75 HIV seropositive patients were controls. The epidemiological data and the follow-up and biological tests performed in these two populations argue that donors with persistent and isolated anti-core antibodies are not seroconverting for HIV. We conclude: (1) that verification of all anti-HIV ELISA-positive sera by Western blot is essential and that the presence of at least once anti-envelope (gp120 or gp41) antibody is indispensable for the diagnosis of HIV infection; (2) that the solitary anti-p24 or anti-p17 bands observed on Western blot are false-positive. There is no evidence that donors with such reactivities are HIV-infected.\r"

In vivo and in vitro cell-mediated responses to tuberculin were lower in patients than in controls. Differences were not significant for candidin and streptococcal antigen in vitro, whereas higher responses were observed in the patient group for cytomegalovirus antigen. Following immunization, a subgroup of patients did not have a significantly raised serum antitetanus antibody level, whereas in vitro lymphocyte proliferative responses to tetanus toxoid were lower than in controls. No association was found between these abnormalities and other immunological parameters, including the blood level of CD4+ lymphocytes. Lower responses to most microbial antigens were observed in patients with HIV-1-related symptoms in addition to lymphadenopathy, or the patients who progressed to AIDS in the 2 years following the study. Moreover, intravenous drug users showed higher responses than homosexual patients, possibly because of the influence of previous infections on immunological responses to microbial antigens.\r"

Fifteen lymph nodes taken from patients with follicular hyperplasia not related to HIV-1 infection served as controls. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization techniques revealed infected cells within the sinuses and the efferent lymphatics of the PGL lymph nodes. In contrast, infected cells could not be detected within the walls of the high endothelial venules nor in the areas immediately adjacent. The parenchymal side of the marginal sinus was lined by a discontinuous endothelium. Macrophages and lymphocytes were located within the gaps of this endothelium. More importantly, when the enlarged follicle extended as far as the wall of the marginal sinus, the processes of follicular dendritic cells could be seen extending through the gaps into the lumen of the sinus. This suggests that these cells could transport antigens (including HIV-1) from the sinuses directly to the germinal centers. In addition, HIV-1 particles within cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in infected macrophages located in the submarginal zone. Positive cells were also found in the extrafollicular lymphoid parenchyma, especially in the area between the marginal sinus and the follicles. The observed distribution of the virus-positive cells within the PGL lymph nodes strongly implicates the lymphatic vessels in the spread of HIV-1 infection.\r"

Seven of the haemophiliacs had detectable lgG4 antibodies to p24, a pattern which was found in only one of the sera from the non-haemophiliacs (P = 0.0022).

The umbilical venous PO2 in the oxygen-only groups was higher than in the oxygen-nitrous oxide groups, this difference reaching statistical significance when the patients in the oxygen-only groups were combined.

One hour after administration of morphine, one of the following was given i.v.: nalmefene 0.4 mg/70 kg; naloxone 0.4 mg/70 kg (low dose); naloxone 1.6 mg/70 kg (high dose); or saline placebo. The depression of VE8 by morphine was antagonized by all three treatments for the 1.5 h after the injection. However, for the 1.5-6 h after antagonist, VE8 following naloxone became depressed, whereas VE8 after nalmefene remained significantly increased compared with other treatments. Nalmefene restored the slope of the ventilatory response to baseline for 6 h and differed significantly from low but not high dose naloxone. Resting end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements demonstrated that nalmefene activity exceeded that of low but not high dose naloxone over the 1.5-4.5 h period. Rate of ventilation was not different between treatments.\r"

We have recently devised a more sensitive parameter for the kappa-lambda analysis than the D value called the delta-curve (delta c); the delta c applies the same principle as that of the D value. Mixing experiments with kappa-type and lambda-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells revealed that the delta c could not only detect a minor population of malignant kappa-B cells, but also that of malignant lambda-B cells using more sensitivity than the D value. A total of 49 blood samples obtained from 27 patients with various B-cell malignancies were investigated. D values were abnormal in 37% of all samples, while abnormal patterns of the delta c were recognized in 71%. On the other hand, 59% of samples obtained from the patients with B-cell lymphoma in aleukemic phase showed abnormal delta c, whereas D values exceeded the upper limit of the normal value in only 15% of the samples. It was suggested that the delta c could detect 3% to 7% of malignant B cells that were mixed with a population of normal lymphocytes.\r"

  ".U": "89027068\r", 
  ".W": "The vascular endothelium plays an important role in fibrinolysis by producing tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). The monokine tumor necrosis factor (human recombinant TNF) increased the production of PAI by cultured human endothelial cells from umbilical vein (twofold) and from foreskin microvessles (four to eight fold). This was demonstrated by titration of endothelial cell-conditioned medium with t-PA, by reverse fibrin autography, and by immunoprecipitation of [35S]PAI-1 by anti-PAI-1 IgG. TNF also induced a marked increase of PAI-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cells. The stimulation of PAI activity by TNF was seen at 4 U/mL and reached a maximum at 500 U/mL. Human recombinant lymphotoxin and interleukin-1 (alpha and beta) also stimulated the production of PAI activity, while interleukin-6 was ineffective. Separate additions of TNF or interleukin-1 (IL-1) at optimal concentrations (500 U/mL and 5 U/mL, respectively) resulted in a comparable stimulation of PAI production by endothelial cells. The simultaneous addition of both mediators resulted in an additive effect. The effect of TNF could not be prevented by the addition of polymyxin B or by anti-IL-1 antibodies. Therefore, it is unlikely that TNF acts through the induction of IL-1 secretion by endothelial cells. Two hours after a bolus injection of 250,000 U/kg TNF into rats, a fivefold increase in circulating PAI levels was found. In the next ten hours, the levels returned to normal. Blood platelets do not significantly contribute to the increase in circulating PAI, because the number of platelets did not change after TNF injection and the amount of PAI in blood platelets is not sufficient for several hours during an increase in PAI activity. The acute phase reactants, fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin in rat plasma, were altered little if any two to 24 hours after injection of 250,000 U/kg TNF. In vitro, TNF did not change PAI production by human and rat hepatocytes in primary monolayer culture. Therefore, it is most likely that vascular endothelial cells contribute to the increased amount of circulating PAI induced by TNF in vivo. This increase in PAI activity might decrease fibrinolysis.\r"

  ".W": "A hairy cell leukemia population was used as a clonal model for studying the direct immunomodulatory effects of recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) and rIFN-gamma on human B-cell proliferation. The leukemic cell population KON was notably quiescent when incubated in medium alone but was induced to significant in vitro DNA synthesis when cultured with any of four activators of human B cells: anti-IgM antibody, Staphylococcus aureus cells (SAC), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or B-cell growth factor (BCGF). While both rIFN-gamma and rIFN-alpha A exhibited suppressive effects on these responses, their inhibitory patterns were distinct and reciprocal. Thus, rIFN-gamma exclusively suppressed anti-IgM-and SAC-induced leukemic DNA synthesis, and rIFN-alpha A significantly suppressed only PMA- and BCGF-induced DNA synthesis. The effects of the rIFN preparations were ablated in the presence of IFN type-specific monoclonal antibodies. Kinetic analyses and pulsing studies revealed that inhibition was most notable when cells were exposed concomitantly to IFN and the activating ligand. That the diverse effects of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha A are manifested on a single B-cell clone was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme-digested KON cell DNA with a JH-specific probe. These studies suggest that the therapeutic potential of the two types of IFN may be influenced by the nature of the extracellular ligands in the leukemic mileau that promote leukemic clonal expansion.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) a subset of CD8, HNK1, and DR-positive T lymphocytes are able to inhibit CFU-GM and BFU-E growth with an HLA-DR restriction. In this study we investigated whether these cells, present in normal marrow in low concentration (less than 1%), play the same role. HNK1-positive sorted marrow cells forming rosettes (E+C) were able to inhibit BFU-E and CFU-GM growth when added back to the marrow E-C at a ratio of 1:10 (HNK1+ E+C/E-C) in a range from 40% to 60%. This inhibitory effect was also detected for a cellular ratio of 1:100, which is the normal marrow value for this subset of T cell. HNK1+ DR+-sorted E+C after double-immunofluorescent labeling also showed the same inhibitory activity as the HNK1+ E+C, whereas the negative fraction including all the other E+C had no detectable inhibitory activity. CD3 and CD8 antigens were also present on the membrane of these cells, as demonstrated in two cases by double-immunofluorescent labeling performed with anti-CD3 or anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and HNK1 MoAb, respectively, and subsequent cell sorting. Blocking experiments, performed by adding in culture anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 MoAbs to HNK1+ T cells showed that only the last MoAb was able to prevent inhibition of hematopoietic colony growth. These results confirmed that one subset of CD3+, CD8+, HNK1+, and DR+ T cells was responsible for in vitro inhibition of normal hematopoiesis. In addition, this inhibition was genetically restricted to HLA-class II antigens, since in three co-culture experiments with unrelated bone marrow cells inhibition occurred only when cells with one haplo-identical HLA-DR antigen was added back to the culture. Indeed, this effect was really HLA-DR restricted, since in blocking experiments with different anti-HLA class II MoAbs (anti-DR, anti-DP, and anti-DQ MoAbs) only an anti-HLA-DR MoAb was able to prevent the colony growth inhibition by CD3+ HNK1+, or CD8+ HNK1+ E+C. In conclusion, the CD3+, HNK1+, CD8+, DR+ cells may be the T-cell subset able to inhibit normal hematopoiesis with an HLA-DR restriction.\r"

These cases could be separated into lymphoid and nonlymphoid types on the basis of enzyme activity, with two misclassifications. However, PNP activity added little or no discriminatory information. Analysis for expression of the various molecular weight (mol wt) ADA isozymes, ADA1 (40 Kd) and ADA2 (110 Kd), revealed that ADA2 was expressed exclusively in nonlymphoid cells whereas ADA1 was found in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell types. Identification of ADA2 divided these leukemia cases into lymphoid and nonlymphoid types with no misclassifications (P = .0002; Fisher's exact test). Acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) with a monocytic component tended to have a greater percentage of ADA2 than ANLL without a monocytic component. These studies suggest that ADA2 may be a novel biochemical marker for an immature nonlymphoid cell.\r"

  ".W": "Granulocyte (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, PMN) sequestration in the microvascular bed with release of different mediators has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and allergic disorders in many organs including the lung. In the present study, we investigated the profile and quantity of leukotriene (LT) generation in isolated blood-free perfused rabbit lungs, in isolated PMNs in vitro and in rabbit lungs, following administration of PMNs, mimicking pulmonary leukostasis. Following stimulation with increasing concentrations of the calcium ionophore A 23137 (0.1 to 2 mumol/L), LTs were detected in the buffer fluid by their chromatographic mobility in different high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, by on-line peak spectrum analysis, and by post-HPLC radioimmunoassay (RIA). In isolated lungs, a dose-dependent generation of cysteinyl LTs greater than LTB4, in the complete absence of omega-oxidation products of LTB4 as well as nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of LTA4, was evoked. PMNs in vitro showed a typical profile of LT liberation (LTB4, 20-OH-, and COOH-LTB4, nonenzymatic LTA4 metabolites). In the model of pulmonary leukostasis, the presence of omega-oxidation products of LTB4 indicated metabolic integrity of the trapped PMNs. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of LTA4 were, however, not detected in the combined system, whereas the cysteinyl LTs increased markedly. This profile suggests intercellular transfer of PMN-derived LTA4 to lung cells in the microenvironment. In addition, at 2 mumol/L A23187, the sum of all LTA4-derived products surpassed the arithmetic sum of the isolated preparations more than threefold. This potentiation of an LT generation under conditions of pulmonary leukostasis may be of biologic significance for amplification of inflammatory events.\r"

  ".W": "An unusual case of an aggressive leukemia of natural killer (NK) cells occurred in a 65-year-old male. Clinical characteristics of this case included hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, marrow infiltrate with leukemic cells, and a WBC up to 82.8 X 10(9) before therapy. One year before his presentation he had been noted to have a WBC of 12.1 X 10(9) with 78% lymphocytes, and 6 months before had noted intermittent fever and weight loss. He and his brother had well documented hereditary cold urticaria. The patient was treated with a modification of ProMACE CYTABOM regimen and had prompt regression of the leukemia with associated acute tumor lysis. Renal, hepatic, and marrow failure predominated during a terminal course that ended 22 days after therapy was commenced, and at autopsy there was no evidence for leukemic cell infiltrate in the liver, spleen or marrow. The leukemic cells were large granular lymphocytes by light and electron microscopic criteria, and had the following immunophenotype: CD2+, DR+, Leu7+, NKH1+, CD11+, CD3-, CD5-, CD4-, CD8-, CD16-. The cells displayed high antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and NK activity, and had a high rate of spontaneous proliferation in vitro that was not augmented by phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Southern analysis of DNA from leukemic cells revealed normal germline arrangements for the beta and gamma chains of the T cell antigen receptor and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. The majority of metaphases were clonally abnormal revealing consistent rearrangements involving extra material attached to the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 11.\r"

Analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor-beta (TCR beta) gene rearrangements from serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens (MNCs) confirmed not only the B-cell nature of the disease, but also the subsequent emergence of a morphologically indistinguishable population of cells with a clonal TCR beta rearrangement in addition to the original Ig gene rearrangement. With the exception of a transient increase in peripheral blood T cells during treatment with deoxycoformycin (DCF), the MNCs remained essentially constant throughout therapy with no evidence of a co-existing T-cell clone to account for the TCR beta rearrangement. Although MNCs from this patient bound significantly less IFN-alpha than did MNCs from other HCL patients, the binding was of high affinity with a kd similar to that of control cells. The number of IFN-gamma receptors on our patient's MNCs was four times higher than the number of IFN-alpha receptors and was similar to the number of IFN-alpha receptors on MNCs from HCL patients responsive to IFN-alpha. While various treatments including IFN-alpha, DCF, chlorambucil, splenectomy, leukopheresis, and IFN-gamma were not able to change the clinical progression of the disease, they may have provided an opportunity for the divergent TCR beta rearranged clone to expand and displace the initially dominant clone.\r"

One monoclonal antibody, designated PP3-4C, blocked Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination and caused 80% inhibition of Ristocetin-induced 125I-von Willebrand factor (vWF) binding to porcine platelets at a concentration of greater than or equal to 12 micrograms IgG/mL. PP3-4C did not affect adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Binding of 125I-Fab fragments of PP3-4C to platelets was saturable at 3.7 x 10(4) +/- 0.8 x 10(4) molecules per platelet. Another monoclonal antibody, designated PP3-3A, blocked ADP- or collagen-induced platelet aggregation at 6 micrograms IgG/mL. At a concentration of 10 micrograms IgG/mL, PP3-3A completely inhibited binding either of 125I-fibrinogen or of 125I-vWF to ADP-stimulated platelets. PP3-3A did not affect Ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination nor 125I-vWF binding to platelets in the presence of Ristocetin. Binding of 125I-Fab' fragments of PP3-3A to platelets was saturable at 9.8 x 10(4) +/- 1.2 x 10(4) molecules per platelet. PP3-4C antibody (anti-GP Ib) did not bind to human platelets; however, PP3-3A antibody (anti-GP IIb-IIIa) had partial cross-reactivity with human platelets. Immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized surface-radiolabeled porcine platelets and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that PP3-4C recognized a GP with an apparent molecular weight of 160,000 (nonreduced), and 140,000 (reduced). PP3-3A recognized GPs with apparent molecular weights of 130,000 and 80,000 (nonreduced), and 115,000 and 95,000 (reduced). These monoclonal antibodies to porcine platelet membrane GPs, which are structural and functional analogues of human GP Ib and GP IIb/IIIa, will be useful for in vitro and in vivo studies of the mammalian hemostatic mechanism.\r"

Both cell lines had a hypertetraploid karyotype with two rearranged no. 7 chromosomes: 2der(7)t(7;7)(p15;q11). The presence of a break in chromosome band 7p15 suggested the involvement of T gamma. We cloned the rearranged BamHI fragments spanning the known T-gamma constant and joining regions. Comparison with germline clones of T gamma did not suggest any of the clones included a breakpoint region. Thus the 7p15 chromosomal abnormality in Molt-3 and Molt-4 is not associated with the currently described joining and constant regions of T gamma.\r"

Factor VIII activation by thrombin was unaffected in either rate or extent by the presence of PS:PC or activated platelets. In contrast, factor VIII activation by factor Xa required either PS:PC or platelets. The products of optimal factor VIII activation by the two enzymes, designated factor VIIIa(T) and factor VIIIa(Xa), are kinetically different in the activation of factor X by factor IXa, factor VIIIa(T) being approximately twice as active (in factor X activation) as factor VIIIa(Xa) in the presence of PS:PC or platelets. Factor VIIIa(Xa) can be converted to the more active VIIIa(T) by thrombin treatment, but the activity of factor VIIIa(T) is unchanged by factor Xa treatment. Factor X activation was also studied with optimally activated factor VIIIa(T), in the presence of PS:PC or activated platelets, as a function of factor IXa concentration in order to determine the apparent dissociation constant for the factor IXa-VIIIa interaction in the two cases. Activated platelets increased the apparent affinity more than fivefold.\r"

This observation provided the scientific basis for a trial of intravenous anti-Tac in the treatment of nine patients with ATL. The patients did not suffer untoward reactions and did not have a reduction in the normal formed elements of the blood, and only one of the nine produced antibodies to the anti-Tac MoAb. Three patients had transient mixed, partial, or complete remissions lasting from 1 to more than 8 months after anti-Tac therapy, as assessed by routine hematologic tests, immunofluorescence analysis of circulating cells, and molecular genetic analysis of HTLV-I provirus integration and of the T-cell receptor gene rearrangement. The precise mechanism of the antitumor effects is unclear; however, the use of a MoAb that prevents the interaction of IL-2 with its receptor on ATL cells provides a rational approach for the treatment of this malignancy.\r"

Using the heat-stable DNA polymerase Taq and automated cycling of the reaction, we were able to detect as few as one to two copies of bcl-2/JH. Under these conditions, PCR proved to be at least 10,000-fold more sensitive than either conventional flow cytometry or Southern blot restriction analysis. In addition, genomic DNA sequences of four lymphomas confirmed that the size of the amplified segment serves as a tumor marker. Direct application of PCR to patient staging revealed occult malignant lymphoma in tissue otherwise considered uninvolved by standard criteria. We conclude that the striking enhancement in diagnostic sensitivity attained by DNA amplification can serve as a valuable adjunct to the staging and clinical monitoring of follicular lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure to solar radiation is increasingly being associated with a risk of cutaneous melanoma, and some risk has also been attributed to exposure to fluorescent lights. The risk of cutaneous melanoma associated with exposure to some sources of artificial ultraviolet radiation was examined in a case-control study in a Scottish population with fairly low exposure to natural ultraviolet radiation. The risk was not significantly or consistently raised for exposure to fluorescent lights at home or at work. The use of ultraviolet lamps and sunbeds, however, was associated with a significantly increased risk (relative risk = 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.4), and the risk was significantly related to duration of use. The risk was particularly raised among people who have first used [corrected] ultraviolet beds or lamps more than [corrected] five years before presentation (relative risk = 9.1; 95% confidence intervals 2.0-40.6), in whom it was significantly related to cumulative hours of exposure. The risks associated with exposure to ultraviolet lamps and sunbeds remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors for melanoma.\r"

  ".W": "The cancer information service of the British Association of Cancer United Patients (BACUP) was launched in October 1985 as a national service to patients and their relatives, the public, and health professionals. Information is provided by telephone and letter by seven nurses trained in oncology. In the first two years over 30,000 inquiries were received: 23,527 (80%) were from women; 9445 (32%) were from cancer patients 11,574 (39%) from relatives of patients, and 2869 (10%) from health professionals. Inquiries came from all over the United Kingdom and from all sections of society but users were predominantly middle class, aged between 30 and 49, and living in south east England. Information about specific cancer sites, treatment, and how to cope was most commonly sought. Nearly a third of all inquiries were related to breast cancer. Though the service is used more by particular groups focusing on particular diseases, clearly there is a need for a cancer information service in the UK.\r"

There is continuing uncertainty about the effectiveness of community psychiatric services that will be expected to cope with mental hospital inpatients after discharge, most of whom have schizophrenia. A survey was conducted to assess the severity of illness among such patients and implications for their future care. All 222 patients in non-psychogeriatric long stay wards of a mental hospital who met research diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were interviewed by two psychiatrists with the comprehensive psychopathological rating scale to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology. A complete interview was not possible for 28 patients, mainly for reasons related to their schizophrenia. Despite energetic pharmacological and social treatments almost half of the 194 patients interviewed had enduring florid psychotic symptoms that presented as one or more delusions or auditory hallucinations, or both, and a sizable proportion showed behaviour that would set them apart in a community setting. The results illustrate a problem that is still imperfectly understood by policy makers and administrators in central and local government and in health authorities who are responsible for planning and implementing services for psychiatric care in the community.\r"

  ".W": "Transabdominal chorionic villus biopsy is an established method of obtaining material for analysing fetal chromosomes in the first trimester of pregnancy but has not been widely used for karyotyping in the second and third trimesters, when rapid results are required. The technique was evaluated in two groups of patients, comprising 106 at risk of having a fetus with chromosomal anomalies (105) or X linked disease (one) studied between 13 and 22 weeks (median 15 weeks) of gestation (group 1) and 21 with abnormal fetal findings on ultrasonography studied between 13 and 38 weeks (median 27 weeks) (group 2). Chorionic tissue was collected at the first attempt in 109 patients and at the second attempt in a further 17 independent of the position of the placenta. In one case from group 1 sufficient material for analysis could not be obtained. Seven abnormal karyotypes (six in group 1 and one in group 2) were diagnosed. Karyotyping was unsuccessful in two cases in group 1 (at 17 and 18 weeks' gestation) and in two in group 2 (at 29 and 38 weeks' gestation). Follow up of group 1 four weeks after sampling showed no signs of adverse fetal development apart from one unexplained intrauterine fetal death. The findings suggest that chorionic sampling is a safe and valuable additional technique for the late detection of chromosomal defects.\r"

Because of the J shaped relation between alcohol consumption and death the excess mortality used as a baseline was an alcohol consumption of 1-10 units/week and an adjustment was made for the slight excess mortality of abstainers. The number of excess deaths was obtained by subtracting the number of deaths expected if all the population had the consumption of the lowest risk group; correction for the total observed mortality in the population was made. This resulted in an estimate of 28,000 deaths each year in England and Wales as the excess mortality among people aged 15-74 associated with alcohol consumption.\r"

Precise information about the duration of treatment was available for 12,543 patients. The frequency of many events was calculated, including dizziness (483 patients; 3.9%), persistent dry cough (360; 2.9%), headache (310; 2.5%) hypotension (218; 1.7%), and syncope (155; 1.2%). Less common reactions included angioedema, urticaria, and muscle cramps. Altogether 1098 (8%) patients died and the notes of 913 of them (83%) were obtained for detailed scrutiny. With the exception of a few patients with renal failure who deteriorated during treatment (reported on separately), no death was attributed to enalapril. Enalapril was considered to be effective, even in patients with advanced cardiac failure. These results for enalapril are reassuring and provide further evidence of the value of prescription-event monitoring.\r"

In seventy five there was a rise in the urea or creatinine concentration of 50% or more above pretreatment values. Enalapril appeared to have contributed to a decline in renal function and subsequent death in 10 of these patients. Several characteristics were identified among these patients, including old age, the use of high dose or potassium sparing diuretics, and pre-existing renal disease. Adding a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug was also associated with a deterioration in patients with previously stable renal function. No death was encountered of a patient with uncomplicated hypertension. Enalapril infrequently contributed to a substantial decline in renal function in certain vulnerable patients, especially those receiving other drugs known to be capable of adversely affecting renal function. Awareness of the characteristics of these patients and of their concomitant treatment may serve to reduce the risk.\r"

Total period fertility rates and total period legal abortion rates were derived from the average number of live births or legal abortions that would be experienced per woman if women experienced the age specific rates of the year in question throughout their childbearing years. The sample of 30 health authorities was selected by taking the districts with the highest and lowest fertility rates in each English region and in Wales in 1986. Total period fertility rates varied from 1.37 in Riverside to 2.42 in Tower Hamlets, while abortion rates varied from 0.25 in East Yorkshire to 0.99 in Riverside. When the two rates were added to provide a potential fertility rate it became clear that some districts with similar potential fertility rates had very different underlying component rates. Such comparisons can be used for service monitoring, indicating the need for better abortion and family planning services in districts with high fertility rates and for better family planning services in those with high abortion rates.\r"

The prescriptions offered by the program were compared with those given by a general practitioner after examining the patient. It was found that 390 of 500 (78%) patients in the first group and 276 of 400 (69%) patients in the second group were offered prescriptions comparable to the ones given by the general practitioner, and the rest were advised to see a doctor. In no case was a patient offered treatment when he or she needed to see a doctor. The results of the evaluation confirm that most problems seen by first level medical personnel in developing countries are simple, repetitive, and treatable at home or by a paramedical worker with a few safe, essential drugs, thus avoiding unnecessary visits to a doctor.\r"

  ".W": "The possibility of improving the effectiveness of antenatal screening for Down's syndrome by measuring human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations in maternal serum during the second trimester to select women for diagnostic amniocentesis was examined. The median maternal serum human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration in 77 pregnancies associated with Down's syndrome was twice the median concentration in 385 unaffected pregnancies matched for maternal age, gestational age, and duration of storage of the serum sample. Measuring human chorionic gonadotrophin in maternal serum was an effective screening test, giving a lower false positive rate (3%) at a 30% detection rate than that for maternal age (5%) and the two existing serum screening tests, unconjugated oestriol (7%) and alpha fetoprotein (11%). The most effective screening results were obtained with all four variables combined; at the same 30% detection rate the false positive rate declined to 0.5%. The new screening method would detect over 60% of affected pregnancies, more than double that achievable with the same amniocentesis rate in existing programmes (5%), and could reduce the number of children born with Down's syndrome in the United Kingdom from about 900 a year to about 350 a year.\r"

  ".W": "In a consecutive series of 146 kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin A a strong correlation between matching for the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR loci specificities and outcome of the grafts was observed in male recipients with non-O blood groups. Such a beneficial effect of matching was not found in female patients or male patients with blood group O. In these patients survival of the grafts at one year was good irrespective of the number of HLA-A, B, and DR mismatches. Also in 47 male heart transplant recipients immune responsiveness against mismatched HLA antigens was related to blood group. A significantly higher incidence of rejection episodes was observed in male patients with non-O blood groups (n = 32) than in those with blood group O (n = 15). Matching for HLA-DR reduced the number of acute rejection episodes in male patients with non-O blood. These findings may help explain the controversial reports about the importance of HLA matching in organ transplantation. Furthermore, as most candidates for heart transplantation are male and not of blood group O, the higher incidence of graft rejection in these patients underscores the need for an exchange strategy of donor hearts.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether patients should participate directly in detecting adverse reactions to drugs their ability to provide written reports of symptoms experienced during treatment with amoxycillin or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was investigated. When compared with telephone interviews forms on which patients reported events were reliable (the observed agreement with the same statements posed during telephone calls was 85%, kappa = 0.56) and valid (sensitivity = 54%, specificity = 94%). Patients were also supplied with forms that invited them to report adverse reactions, and their perceptions were compared with those of a panel of experts, who were informed of all clinical events that had been reported during the detailed telephone interviews. Patients were more conservative than the experts in attributing clinical events to drug treatment. The extent of agreement varied and was notably poor for skin and bowel complaints (kappa = 0.13 in each case). The performance of event report forms and reaction report forms as instruments of detection was compared in a hypothetical situation in which the experts' views represented the \"truth\" about adverse reactions to a new drug. Event reporting had a higher sensitivity than reaction reporting (42% v 24%) but a lower specificity (58% v 98%). National centres monitoring adverse drug reactions should probably resist pressure to accept reports of reactions directly from the public, but a system based on large scale reporting of events might be valuable in aiding the early detection of symptomatic reactions to new drugs.\r"

On the basis of the results the cause of the dementia was diagnosed clinically. Neuropathological examinations were performed after death. The clinical diagnosis made during life was not supported by the findings at necropsy in 11 cases. Alzheimer's disease was overdiagnosed in life (13 cases, of which only six were confirmed at necropsy). Although the clinical investigation was limited by availability of resources, neither cranial computed tomography nor the Hachinski score helped to distinguish between multi-infarct dementia and Alzheimer's disease in this age group. This study confirms the value of neuropathological studies in the precise diagnosis of dementia.\r"

When assessed against the full set of 60 questions contained in the psychiatric assessment schedule they had a specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 86%. The scales would be used by non-psychiatrists in clinical investigations and possibly also by medical students to familiarise them with the common forms of psychiatric illness, which are often unrecognised in general medical settings.\r"

Unplanned pregnancies were most common in the 15-19 age group (54 out of 187), and women aged under 25 used contraceptives less reliably than women aged 25 and over. The combined pill was the most effective method of contraception in all age groups. The methods that resulted in most unplanned pregnancies were the sheath in women aged 25 and over and incorrect use of oral contraceptive or no contraception in those aged under 25. The fear of side effects was an important reason why women did not use the combined pill, being cited by 22 out of 134 women, and inappropriate medical advice was cited by a further 20 women. More discussion between doctors and patients and readily available information on the use of oral contraceptives might help to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies.\r"

For only 38% of bed days were patients considered to have medical, nursing, or life support reasons for requiring a provincial teaching hospital bed. The requirements for a bed in the hospital decreased with the patient's age and length of stay in hospital. For only a tenth of patients was the general practitioner concerned in discussions with hospital staff about the patient's discharge and less than one third of patients had been given more than 24 hours' notice of discharge. Several features might increase the proportion of bed days that are occupied by patients with positive reasons for being in hospital. Among these are an increased frequency of ward rounds by consultants, or delegating discharge decisions by consultants to other staff; providing diagnostic related protocols for planning the length of stay in hospital; planned discharges; and providing liaison nurses to help with communication with primary care staff.\r"

It became apparent that patients whose primary tumours had been treated with very wide excision, in particular by compartmental resection, suffered severe late tissue damage when subsequently irradiated with fast neutrons. It was therefore decided to terminate the trial after only 14 patients had been entered. Unacceptable late tissue damage may result from the therapeutic use of fast neutron irradiation when applied in these circumstances.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) can be prevented or ameliorated by global blockade of macrophages. How these cells damage peripheral nervous tissue in this autoimmune demyelinating polyneuropathy is not fully understood. Since macrophages exert a number of their inflammatory actions by the release of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids, we investigated the possible role of these mediators in the pathogenesis of EAN. Lewis rats with myelin-induced EAN were treated before and after onset of clinical signs. Administration of corticosteroids or of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors indomethacin and BW755c before the onset of neurological signs suppressed the disease, as judged by clinical assessment, serial electrophysiological testing and histological examination, while initiation of drug treatment on day 13 postimmunization still markedly attenuated the course of EAN. The selective lipoxygenase blocker nafazatrom had only a slight effect. Determination of the production by macrophages ex vivo of eicosanoids corroborated the predicted site of action of the pharmacological compounds applied. We infer that macrophage-derived proinflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites significantly contribute to functional and tissue damage in EAN. Our results may be relevant to future pharmacological treatment of the acute Guillain-Barre syndrome.\r"

More studies of post-irradiation breasts are needed, from biopsy, surgical, and autopsy specimens. These studies should evaluate the tissues for the presence or absence of tumor, for radiation changes in the breast and the tumor, for evidence of tumor regression, for multicentricity, and for histologic types and patterns. Until this is done, the final results of radiation therapy for carcinoma of the breast will remain unknown.\r"

Perhaps as a consequence of articles demonstrating the costs as well as the recognition that the overall prevalence of disabilities in infants is relatively unchanged, neonatal intensive care has recently been viewed as a possible area for cost containment. We reviewed the literature on the cost of neonatal intensive care and the limited information on other expensive medical programs and found that the cost of neonatal intensive care compared favourably, especially for infants whose birth weight was 1000 to 1500 g. Better information on the outcome of infants of very low birth weight and comparable rigorous studies of the cost effectiveness of other expensive medical programs are required, and other less easily quantified factors must be considered before decisions are made to limit neonatal intensive care on the basis of gestational age or birth weight.\r"

The survival of responding patients is significantly longer than the survival of nonresponders.

  ".W": "The influence of hypercholesterolemia on the reactivity of coronary arteries was investigated after feeding a high-cholesterol diet to pigs for 9 weeks. After this duration of hypercholesterolemia, the fatty or intimal proliferative changes of atherosclerosis were not yet evident in the coronary arteries by light or electron microscopy. Changes in isometric tension were compared in isolated ring segments of coronary arteries from normal and hypercholesterolemic animals. The endothelium failed to inhibit contractions caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine in coronary arteries from hypercholesterolemic animals, but it did so in normal vessels. In contracted arteries, endothelium-dependent relaxations caused by 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P were reduced by hypercholesterolemia. In contrast, endothelium-dependent relaxations mediated by norepinephrine acting at alpha 2-adrenoceptors and those caused by the calcium ionophore A23187 were unaffected. Endothelium-independent beta-adrenergic relaxations caused by norepinephrine, as well as those caused by nitroprusside, and papaverine also were unaffected by hypercholesterolemia. The loss of selective endothelial cell receptor-mediated relaxation suggests that it is not the ability of the coronary artery endothelium to elaborate vasodilators, but the initiation of the coronary artery endothelial cell response to 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P that is affected by hypercholesterolemia. Thus, during hypercholesterolemia, selective endothelial cell dysfunction giving rise to abnormal coronary artery reactivity precedes the onset of coronary artery atherosclerosis.\r"

Intermittent intraperitoneal IgG (dosage: 12 g/3 weeks, duration: 24 months) increased the opsonic capacity for Staphylococcus epidermidis of the effluent 3-fold, while the peritonitis rate fell to 0.2/year. During the treatment interval the effluent IgG levels and opsonic capacity of the dialysate were initially high and fell progressively thereafter. However, even at trough levels it still remained higher than in controls. Interleukin-1 levels increased 2.5-fold from the third to the eighth day. In those patients with lower clinical response, IgG levels and opsonic capacity of the dialysate were only transiently elevated; their macrophages were shown to be deficient in Fc-receptors. Intraperitoneal human recombinant interferon-alpha was able to improve Fc-receptor expression, oxygen metabolite generation of macrophages and bactericidal capacity of the dialysate in these patients. In conclusion, an unusually high peritonitis rate in CAPD patients may be treated by intraperitoneal IgG-application; in poor responders intraperitoneal interferon should be considered.\r"

The protein loss into the dialysate varies between 5-15 g per day; during peritonitis protein loss increases by 50-100%. The loss of free amino acids during CAPD is of the same magnitude as under hemodialysis. The observed plasma amino acid abnormalities in CAPD patients probably reflect metabolic derangements in uremia, rather than depletion due to dialysate amino acid loss. Sustained hyperinsulinemia in CAPD patients also may contribute to reduced plasma amino acid concentrations. A further factor contributing to nutritional problems in CAPD is a decreased protein intake. Dietary protein intake should exceed 1.2 g/kg/day during long-term CAPD treatment to maintain nitrogen equilibrium. Total energy intake may exceed 35 kcal/kg/day.\r"

Hepatic biotransformation capability before flecainide dosing was assessed by antipyrine challenge. The mean plasma antipyrine t1/2 for patients (42.2 hours) was longer (p less than 0.01) than that for subjects (11.7 hours). For control subjects, the plasma t1/2 of flecainide (9.5 hours) was shorter (p less than 0.01), plasma clearance (9.1 ml/min/kg) was faster (p less than 0.01), and volume of distribution (7.5 L/kg) was smaller (p less than 0.05) compared with corresponding values in patients. Renal clearance did not differ (p greater than 0.05) between the two groups. The mean ratio of renal clearance to plasma clearance for subjects (0.4) was smaller (p less than 0.05) than that for patients. The slower rate of flecainide elimination from plasma in patients is likely due to reduced hepatic biotransformation. In patients with cirrhosis, plasma levels of flecainide may accumulate to unacceptably high levels with usual dosage regimens.\r"

Glycohemoglobin levels were significantly lower than control at 3 and 6 months whereas C-peptide levels were significantly increased at 3 and 9 months. Responders exhibited as much as a 50% reduction in total insulin dose compared with nonresponders or control subjects. These results suggest that combination therapy affords transient metabolic improvement in certain patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Improvement in fasting glucose levels appears to be mediated by enhanced insulin secretion.

Atrial natriuretic factor was found to be eight times higher than age-matched healthy control subjects (p = 0.001). Although atrial natriuretic factor correlated well with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.592), there was no significant relationship between right atrial pressure and plasma atrial natriuretic factor (r = 0.258). Atrial natriuretic factor was best related to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r = 0.751). We conclude that in ARDS, plasma atrial natriuretic factor is markedly elevated and arterial levels are best determined by left atrial pressure and pulmonary hemodynamics, and not by right sided cardiac pressures. The role of increased circulating atrial natriuretic factor in the pathophysiology of ARDS is to be clarified in future studies.\r"
