There was after propofol alone a significant decrease in arterial blood pressure, which did not increase above control values after intubation. Significant increases in arterial pressure followed intubation in patients induced with thiopentone or etomidate alone. Increases in heart rate occurred with all agents after laryngoscopy. The use of fentanyl resulted in arterial pressures lower than those after the induction agent alone, and in an attenuation, but not abolition of the responses to laryngoscopy and intubation.\r"

Premedication consisted of midazolam 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly and metoprolol 1 mg/kg orally. Measurements were made or derived at time zero and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 minutes after an induction dose of propofol 1.5 mg/kg. A continuous infusion of propofol was started at time zero at a rate of 100 mg/kg/minute. Fentanyl 2 micrograms/kg was added before tracheal intubation, application of the pin head holder and skin incision. Cerebrospinal fluid pressure and mean arterial pressure decreased significantly 2 minutes after propofol alone, by 32% and 10% respectively, while a cerebral perfusion pressure above 70 mmHg was maintained. Heart rate did not change. Propofol combined with moderate dose of fentanyl, obtunded the usual cerebrospinal fluid and arterial pressure responses to intubation and other noxious stimuli. Thus propofol seems to be a suitable intravenous anaesthetic agent for induction and maintenance in neuroanaesthesia.\r"

Somatosensory evoked cortical potentials were recorded on the scalp and compared to pre-operative values using Student's paired t-test. We observed a significant depression of evoked potential 10 minutes after induction, which continued until the early phase of recovery. Because of its short and quickly reversible action, propofol is an acceptable agent when clinical monitoring of the spinal cord is indicated but is not satisfactory when monitoring has to be based on somatosensory cortical evoked potentials.\r"

The average induction doses were 2.15 and 4.83 mg/kg for propofol and thiopentone, respectively. Half the patients in each group received a supplementary dose of the same induction agent (propofol 1.0 mg/kg or thiopentone 2.0 mg/kg) (corrected) prior to intubation. Both propofol and thiopentone produced a significant reduction in intra-ocular pressure which decreased further after administration of vecuronium as well as the second smaller dose of the induction agents. Intra-ocular pressure prior to intubation was lower in the two propofol groups in comparison to the corresponding thiopentone groups. Intubation was associated with an increase in intra-ocular pressure but it still remained significantly below the baseline values except in the group given one dose of thiopentone. Supplementary doses of induction agents before intubation attenuated the increase in intra-ocular pressure. Propofol was significantly more effective in this respect and this group showed the lowest intra-ocular pressure throughout the study period. However, administration of propofol resulted in a 30% incidence of pain on injection and a decrease in systolic arterial pressure of more than 30% in about half the patients.\r"

Induction of anaesthesia was smooth; 91.6% of patients experienced no excitatory or other adverse effect. The mean duration of anaesthesia was 12 minutes 12 seconds and the mean dosage of propofol was 10.6 mg/kg/hour. Maintenance was uneventful in the large majority of patients. Pain on injection affected approximately 25% of patients and the incidence was reduced when large veins were used for injection.

Recovery, judged by ability to open the eyes and recall date of birth, was significantly more rapid after propofol than after midazolam (2 and 10 minutes respectively after the end of infusion) and two patients in the latter group were unduly drowsy in the initial postoperative period. Pre- and postoperative amnesia were greater in the midazolam group but no patient had recall of peri-operative events. Psychometric tests showed significantly better recovery of higher mental function after propofol for up to 2 hours after surgery.\r"

Among these, 757 (26.9%) were type b strains. The overall rate of beta-lactamase-mediated ampicillin resistance was 20.0%. Type b strains were approximately twice as likely as non-type b strains to produce beta-lactamase (31.7 versus 15.6%). The MICs of 12 antimicrobial agents were determined for all isolates. Ampicillin resistance among strains that lacked beta-lactamase activity was extremely uncommon (0.1%). Percentages of study isolates susceptible to cefamandole, cefaclor, cephalothin, and cephalexin were 98.7, 94.5, 87.3, and 43.3%, respectively. For 14 strains (0.5% of the total), chloramphenicol MICs were greater than or equal to 8.0 micrograms, and thus the strains were considered resistant. All of these resistant strains produced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. In addition, all 14 strains were resistant to tetracycline; 11 produced beta-lactamase. The percentage of isolates susceptible to tetracycline was 97.7%. In contrast, erythromycin and sulfisoxazole were relatively inactive. The combination of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (1/64) was more active than erythromycin alone but essentially equivalent in activity to sulfisoxazole alone. Finally, small numbers of clinical isolates of H. influenzae were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin.\r"

Aztreonam was more active against Pseudomonas spp., and tigemonam was more active against some streptococci. Tigemonam was highly resistant to hydrolysis by the eight beta-lactamase enzymes tested. A significant (greater than a fourfold increase in the MICs of tigemonam) inoculum effect occurred when 3 of 13 isolates were tested with inocula of 5 X 10(5) and 1 X 10(7) CFU/ml. Tigemonam was bactericidal for all but 1 of the 13 isolates. Of the four quality-control strains recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, only Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 provided on-scale results.

All patients were completely revascularized. The average number of grafts per patient in both groups was 3.2. Patients were followed 10 years; follow-up was 97.5% complete. Group 1 and Group 2 were compared in regard to mortality, treadmill response, myocardial infarction, reoperation, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and return to work. Mortality in Group 1 was 17.9% versus 7.7% in Group 2 (p less than 0.05). Treadmill studies were positive in 17 Group 1 patients and 7 Group 2 patients (p less than 0.05). Myocardial infarctions occurred in 8 patients in Group 1 versus 3 in Group 2. The number of reoperations was 2 in Group 1 versus 1 in Group 2. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in 3 patients in Group 1 and 2 in Group 2. Repeat studies revealed 76.3% patency of the SV graft to the LAD (Group 1) and 94.6% patency of the LIMA graft to the LAD (Group 2). Cardiac-related mortality in Group 1 was 12.8% at 10 years (5 patients) versus 7.7% in Group 2 (3 patients). Based on this study, the IMA is a superior conduit for bypass to the LAD.\r"

In this study, the labyrinth was destroyed unilaterally in a series of cats. Animals constantly fell and demonstrated prominent contralateral nystagmus and a rotary motion of the head. Within four hours of a 4-mg/kg intravenous lidocaine hydrochloride injection, the cats were able to ambulate freely without falling. The nystagmus was reduced, and there was virtual absence of the rotary head motion. In contrast, the controls had persistent signs of vestibular disturbance. These results demonstrate that lidocaine infusion ameliorates the effects of unilateral labyrinthectomy in cats and thus may be a potential antivertiginous agent.\r"

This result is different from those of serological reactivities of the other accessory gene products of HIV-1 (tat, sor, 3' orf, and R) which did not differentiate among stages of clinical progression. Since ARC is a prodrome for full-blown AIDS, these results suggest that trs may be useful as a prognostic marker for AIDS development.\r"

Asymptomatically infected patients [5 of 19] had significant lymphocyte transformation responses induced in culture by a purified, recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp120) from the virus. A few (4 of 55) subjects with AIDS related complex (ARC) and no subjects with AIDS (0 of 29) had proliferative responses to this protein. These responses correlated directly with circulating levels of helper/inducer lymphocytes (p less than .01) and indirectly with virus antigen in blood (p = .04). Also, these responses occurred significantly less frequently than responses to herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens in seropositive ARC patients (p less than .005). These data indicate that the frequency of immune cellular responses to rgp120 decline in association with disease progression, and become undetectable in frank AIDS. As rgp120-induced proliferation was not observed in cells from 15 seronegative immunocompetent subjects, this response appears immune specific. Immune T-lymphocyte-mediated responses to this HIV envelope glycoprotein may allow the prediction of future clinical events and may be useful in monitoring immune-enhancing therapy in patients with ARC and AIDS.\r"

When the CD16+ lymphocyte compartment was further dissected, lymphoid cells bearing simultaneously low cell-surface density CD8 and CD16 (Leu 11a or Leu 11c) or Leu 19 epitopes were selectively and significantly decreased. This important depletion of CD8+ NK cells, which in most cases are CD3-, accounts for the decline in low-density CD8+ lymphocytes in HIV positive group, while a significant increase occurs in their CTL pool. Furthermore, in HIV negative high-risk homosexuals, a less profound but significant reduction of this lymphocyte subset was also found. Whether the involvement of the NK compartment, especially NK cells expressing the CD8 marker, may influence the outcome of individuals infected with HIV is still an open question.\r"

Generalized lymphadenopathy and clinical signs or symptoms similar to those which are seen with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection were not present. Comparison to seronegative prostitutes and minor surgery control patients were made and significant elevations were seen in T8 lymphocytes (p = .03), IgG (p = .0001), and beta 2-microglobulin (p = .03). The mean T4 lymphocyte count in seropositive prostitutes was lower than in seronegative prostitutes (757 vs. 1179, p = .15), but this difference was not statistically significant and appeared to be correlated with age. No significant differences were noted between the seronegative and seropositive prostitutes in lymphocyte stimulation studies to certain mitogens. Antilymphocyte antibodies above background were not present in either population. We conclude that HIV-2 is a sexually transmitted agent that produces immunologic alterations consistent with a persistent viral infection. HIV-2 seropositive prostitutes studied to date do not show clinical signs of immune suppression, as has been described with HIV-1 infection. The pathogenic potential of HIV-2 appears to differ from that of HIV-1, the etiologic agent of the AIDS pandemic.\r"

The region surrounding the cleavage site between the gp120 and the gp41 subunit contains a receptor-like region immediately followed by a transmembrane-like region containing approximately 13 residues. These two regions are separated by the cleavage site between gp120 and gp41. Since the same arrangement exists in some paramyxoviruses (unpublished observation) and since the effective cleavage between a receptor-like region and the transmembrane-like region is required in paramyxoviruses to generate fusogenic segment (located at the N-terminal sequence of the transmembrane-like region), we have focused our analysis on the conformational properties of the N-terminal peptide segment of HIV gp41. This peptide segment, which consists of a helical structure according to Garnier prediction, was oriented at the lipid-water interface using a theoretical analysis method that we recently developed. Analysis of the transmembrane peptide determined by Eisenberg method shows that the helical segment orients itself in the lipid monolayer obliquely with respect to the lipid-water interface. Since this rather unusual orientation for a membrane segment of a protein is also found in the fusogenic peptide of the Newcastle Disease Virus (Virus Genes, in press) and seems to possess membrane destabilizing properties, it is in agreement with previous reports suggesting a fusogenic role for the N-terminal part of gp41.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-three psoriatic patients with spondylitic involvement (19 women and 24 men, mean age 41 years) have been reviewed. Three different subsets were recognized. The first (PS1), with predominant involvement of the axial skeleton, occurred in 22 (seven women and 15 men, mean age 39). The second (PS2) and the third (PS3) showed an overlap of spondylitis and peripheral articular disease. In PS2 this consisted of distal interphalangeal (DIP) arthritis (five women and three men, mean age 41), while in PS3 there was symmetrical polyarthritis (seven women and six men, mean age 42). Spinal involvement, present in every case, was characterized by unilateral and asymmetrical syndesmophytes, often nonmarginal and randomly affecting the vertebral column. Sacroiliitis, absent in the PS2 subset, was present in 15 of the PS1 and in two of the PS3 subgroup and was bilateral in six and unilateral in 11. The HLA-B27 antigen, absent in the PS2 subgroup, was found in 12 of the PS1 and in two of the PS3 subset. It was associated with sacroiliitis in 13 cases and with spondylitis without sacroiliitis in only one case. Nail changes were recorded in 30% of the total cases and showed a strict relationship with the PS2 subset (40%). Extra-articular symptoms, consisting almost exclusively of ocular involvement, occurred in three patients only (two cases of conjunctivitis and one of acute anterior uveitis). The clinical course of psoriatic spondylitis appeared less disabling than that of the idiopathic form.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) were studied in 5 cynomolgus monkeys before and during the development of a parkinsonian syndrome induced by MPTP. The stimuli were vertical bars of four spatial frequencies (0.5, 1.2, 2.5 and 3.5 cycles/degree (cpd) modulated at temporal rates of 1, 4, 6, and 8 Hz. Following MPTP administration, all monkeys developed parkinsonian signs accompanied by changes in the amplitude and latency of the PVEP and PERG. Sinemet L-dopat carbi olopa administration produced temporary recovery of both PVEP and PERG. Two of the monkeys were followed for a prolonged period: 30-40 days after MPTP, the parkinsonian signs showed partial recovery; the PVEP latency and amplitude to 2.5 and 3.5 cpd stimuli and the latency to 1.2 cpd showed improvement but remained abnormal. The latencies of PERGs were normal, but the amplitudes were significantly reduced when stimuli of 2.5 and 3.5 cpd were used. Both PVEP and PERG to 0.5 cpd stimuli returned to normal. No further modifications were seen in the recordings performed 6 months and 1 year later. This study demonstrates (1) that spatial frequency-dependent electrophysiological abnormalities occur in the MPTP-treated monkey, a result previously found in human Parkinson's disease, and (2) that dopamine has a specific function in neurotransmission in the visual system of primates.\r"

  ".U": "88210195\r", 
  ".W": "Several immunologic variables were evaluated in 14 patients with untreated primary breast cancer and 20 postmastectomized patients undergoing tamoxifen (TAM) or high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) treatment. Immunologic evaluation in the peripheral blood included lymphocyte count, definition of T-lymphocyte subsets by monoclonal antibodies (OKT3, OKT11, OKT4, and OKT8), and lymphocyte blastogenic response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and Concanavalin A (Con A). Moreover, the in vitro effect of TAM and MPA on the blastogenic response of peripheral lymphocytes from normal female subjects was tested. Primary breast cancer patients did not differ from controls in any of the variables tested. Similarly, the immunologic variables of the group treated with TAM were normal, with the exception of a slight reduction of the OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio. In MPA-treated patients, a reduction of the percentage of OKT4+ cells and a decrease of the OKT4+/OKT8+ ratio were observed. Moreover, response to PHA was reduced sharply. However, the addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the culture medium restored PHA response. Likewise, the in vitro addition of MPA to peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal female subjects resulted in a sharp dose-dependent depression of PHA response while TAM was ineffective completely. The inhibitory effect of MPA was not evident when IL-2 was added simultaneously to the culture medium. These results show that the administration of high-dose MPA may alter immunocompetence as defined by T-lymphocyte subsets and response to mitogens. The latter effect may be related to a diminished production of IL-2. In contrast, TAM does not appear to have a significant immunodepressant action either in vitro or in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1984, 13 patients were entered into our study and 12 patients have completed one or more cycles of treatment with mixed bacterial vaccine (MBV), a natural biologic response modifier derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marcescens. Eight patients with refractory malignancy were treated with MBV only (0.1 ml intravenously [IV]) twice weekly for 3-16 weeks (colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, chronic lymphatic leukemia, hepatoma [two patients], sarcoma [three patients]). Four patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were treated with MBV in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide, day 1; cisplatin, day 15; and MBV, 0.1 ml IV, days 5, 7, and 9. Two patients in this study received cyclophosphamide and cisplatin alone. The cycle was repeated every 28 days. Plasma interferon levels, interleukin-2 production by peripheral lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subpopulations were monitored. Interferon levels and interleukin-2 production showed increased or sustained values in general. In some patients, B-cells and helper T-cell populations increased, whereas T-suppressor cell numbers declined. With one exception, side effects were mild and consisted of fever greater than 37.8 degrees C (nine of 13), chills (11 of 13), increased respiratory rate (nine of 13), minor changes in blood pressure (seven of 13), and nausea (three of 13). One patient with non-small cell lung cancer had a partial response. Two patients with non-small cell lung cancer and one patient with refractory malignancy had stable disease and performance status at the end of 8 weeks of treatment; one patient with refractory malignancy was stable at the end of 4 weeks of treatment. In this pilot study, cancer patients treated with MBV showed objective evidence of immune stimulation with acceptable toxicity.\r"

  ".U": "88210219\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 45 courses of 50 g (24 to 33 g/m2) of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) followed by an improved citrovorum rescue (CFR) were administered to 23 patients according to a recently updated procedure. All patients previously had received HDMTX-CFR at lower doses. The HDMTX was administered intravenously (IV) over 6 hours with a priming dose of 8 g followed by 42 g given by continuous infusion. Maintenance of adequate urine output and pH level were achieved with IV fluids, sodium bicarbonate, oral acetazolamite, and a low-acid diet. The CFR was administered by following the equimolar rescue technique and was continued until the serum MTX level was less than 2 X 10(-7) mol/l. The MTX was usually rapidly cleared. The median 48-hour serum MTX level was 7.57 X 10(-6) mol/l (range, 6.8 X 10(-7) mol/l to 7.9 X 10(-5) mol/l). Most patients cleared MTX to below 10(-7) mol/l by the eighth day (range, 5 to 13 days) after MTX infusion. The MTX clearance did not always correlate with the pretreatment creatinine clearance. The toxicity observed included the following: leukocyte count less than or equal to 2000/microliters in 11% of the courses with less than or equal to 1000/microliters in 0%, platelets less than or equal to 10(5)/microliters in 9%, creatinine elevation to greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl in 7%, mild mucositis without ulcerations in 33%, nausea with occasional vomiting in 66%, mild skin rash in 18%, and temporary elevation of liver enzymes in 81% of the courses. All side effects were tolerable and transient, and the patients recovered fully. Patients who cleared MTX rapidly (MTX less than or equal to 2 X 10(-6) mol/l at 48 hours) rarely sustained leukopenia, creatinine elevation, or skin rash. Toxicity was not increased by third space fluids or by delaying CFR to 24 hours instead of 12 hours after MTX. The procedure described allows the safe administration of HDMTX-CFR at the 50-g range to adults with advanced malignant solid tumors.\r"

Cardiac catheterization revealed retrograde flow through the LIMA graft to the subclavian artery and stenosis of the left subclavian artery at its origin from the aorta. Restoration of antegrade flow through the LIMA graft to the coronary arteries was achieved by a carotid-subclavian bypass resulting in a resolution of symptoms. The evaluation of recurrent angina after LIMA bypass grafting should exclude the possibility of subclavian artery stenosis as well as disease of the native and graft coronary anatomy.\r"

Vitamin D3 metabolites markedly enhance the degradation of proteoglycans by macrophages in vitro. However, this enhancing activity of D3 metabolites is eliminated when the growth cartilage cells are lysed with 0.2N NH4OH. Puromycin (10 micrograms/ml) also inhibits the enhancement effect. These results suggest that D3 metabolites stimulate the synthesis of a D3-dependent substance by growth cartilage cells and that subsequently this substance enhances the enzymatic degradation of proteoglycans by macrophages.\r"

Cardiac disease can be overwhelming for both the patient and for the partner, and fear of death is a common and quite normal response. Sexual activity after convalescence is a valuable incentive for patients to undergo rehabilitation. Self-confidence and satisfaction can be greatly enhanced by affectionate closeness, and prolonged foreplay can be savored at any age. Sex play is relaxing and healthful whereas anxious sexual preoccupation, frustration, and avoidance may actually be greater risk factors than the mild physical effort involved for coitus or coital alternatives. Male and female patients with cardiac disease expressed regret that their primary physician, cardiologist, or surgeon had not broached the subject of sexual function before or after the acute illness. They were interested, but both patients and physicians were probably uncomfortable with explicit sexual dialogue. Some common sense reminders to post-MI and post-CABS patients about sexual function may be given verbally or in written form, together with diet and exercise instructions. These should include: a heavy meal or heavy alcohol intake before coitus should be avoided; early morning can be an ideal time for coitus or sex play; moderate room temperature is best; a comfortable sexual position can be found with experimentation; chest pain or palpitations are signals to use appropriate medications; and coital death is rare in a stable, long-standing sexual relationship.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two patients were lost to follow-up and two died; neither death resulted from hemorrhage or treatment complications. Variceal rebleeding occurred in 2 noncompliant patients (14.3%) and was successfully controlled with emergent EVL. Ten patients achieved complete variceal eradication with from 1 to 6 (mean, 3.9) EVL sessions. No major complications (perforation, secondary bleeding, deep ulceration) resulted and there were no treatment failures. Follow-up of 10 surviving patients ranged from 240 to 370 (mean, 280) days. Endoscopic observation suggested that varices were obliterated by a process of mechanical strangulation, ischemia, superficial ulceration, and scar formation. Preliminary data indicate that EVL is a safe and effective treatment for esophageal varices.\r"

Three lung inflation breaths at F10(2) 1.0 were delivered at 12 and 14 cc/kg of lean body weight via ventilator or MRB, followed by 10 seconds of continuous endotracheal suctioning. This sequence was repeated three times. The MRB produced a greater (12 mm Hg) increase in MAP than the ventilator (9 mm Hg), which was not statistically significant (p less than 0.09). MRB caused a larger increase to CO than the ventilator, but this was not statistically significant (p less than 0.10). The MRB generated significantly (p less than 0.000) higher mean airway pressures (45 mm Hg) than the ventilator (23 mm Hg); the larger the volume the higher the pressure. Both methods effectively prevented postsuctioning hypoxemia; the larger the volume the higher the PaO2.\r"

To further define the extent and time course of this toxicity, we established a chronic sheep model and monitored changes in systemic and central vascular pressures, cardiac function, and gas exchange during a 72-h continuous intravenous infusion of rIL-2 at a total dose of 5 (group 3) or 9 x 10(5) U/kg (group 4). At 72 h, caudal mediastinal lymph flow, histology, and extravascular lung water-to-dry lung weight ratio (EVLW/DLW) were obtained. During the rIL-2 infusion there was a dose-dependent significant decrease in systemic blood pressure and arterial Po2 and an increase in core temperature. In group 4, pulmonary arterial pressure increased from a base line of 13 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 6 mmHg (P less than 0.05). Lung lymph flow was significantly increased in groups 3 and 4 compared with animals receiving 0.9% NaCl or excipient infusions (groups 1 and 2). EVLW/DLW values were elevated in groups 3 and 4 (P less than 0.01). In animals receiving rIL-2, histological evaluation revealed a dose-dependent infiltration of lung tissue by lymphoblastoid cells that stained esterase negative. We conclude that rIL-2 infusion in doses comparable to those given to humans results in alterations in systemic and central hemodynamics, gas exchange, high-protein lung lymph flow, and infiltration of lymphoblastoid cells into the lung parenchyma.\r"

To further evaluate these findings, six anesthetized healthy dogs (approximately 30 kg), two in the supine posture, two in the prone posture, and two suspended in the upright posture, breathing spontaneously, were injected (iv) at end expiration with 20 mCi99mTc-labeled albumin macroaggregates. The animals were killed, their chests were opened, their lungs were removed and dissected free of other tissue, and the blood was drained. The lungs were dried by blowing warm air (50 degrees C) while they were inflated to full capacity for about 18 h. The fully inflated and dry lungs were placed in the supine position and SPECT was performed to determine the three-dimensional distribution of activity. One hundred and twenty projections of the activity in the entire lungs were obtained at 3 degrees steps with a rotating gamma camera and stored in computer memory. Once SPECT was completed, either a coronal slice or a sagittal slice (1 cm thick) was cut and imaged directly by placing it against the gamma camera collimator for 6 min. The tomographic-reconstructed slices revealed that at isogravity, in all body postures, Qr in the central region of the lungs was up to 10 times that in the periphery. Furthermore, the central-peripheral gradient was discernible within the individual lobes. The direct images of slices also confirmed these findings. Although flow inequalities independent of gravity were present, the central region with the highest flow often was closer to the dependent regions of the lungs, suggesting that gravity had some influence on the final distribution. The results suggest that factors other than gravity also play an important role in the distribution of pulmonary blood flow. These factors may be related to the conductance of the vascular pathways that lead to different regions in the lungs.\r"

  ".W": "Plasmids of approximately 80 kb in size are found in nearly all clinical isolates of Salmonella dublin and are believed to be essential for virulence. We have shown previously that the 80-kb plasmid pSDL2 is required for the S. dublin Lane strain to establish a lethal systemic infection in BALB/c mice after oral or intraperitoneal inoculation. We now present a physical and genetic characterization of pSDL2. We have established a complete restriction endonuclease cleavage map of pSDL2 for five enzymes: Xba I, Bam HI, Xho I, Sal I, and Hind III. The region specifying autonomous replication has been localized to a 10.5-kb region of the Sal I A fragment by subcloning on the vector pBR322. Using transposon insertion mutagenesis with Tn5-oriT, a region encoding the virulence phenotype has been mapped within a 6.4-kb portion of the Sal I B fragment. Deletions generated by partial Eco RI restriction digestion demonstrate that at least 50 kb of the plasmid DNA are not required for replication or virulence functions, confirming the map location of these phenotypes. Plasmids of different sizes and restriction patterns were found in mouse virulent strains of S. dublin Vi+, S. enteritidis, and S. choleraesuis. By Southern hybridization, these putative virulence plasmids share a common 4-kb Eco RI fragment with the virulence region of pSDL2, and the plasmids from S. dublin Vi+ and S. enteritidis were shown to express mouse virulence comparable to pSDL2.\r"

We tested the ability of these heterodimers to direct a CD2 + CD3 + CD8 + CD4 - CD25 + transferrin receptor + MHC-restricted human cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone to lyse a CALLA + human tumor in vitro. Only heterodimers containing an anti-CD3 antibody or activating antibodies to CD2 could direct the clone to lyse these human tumor targets, even when the clone was additionally activated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 antibodies. Our findings may have implications in the design of strategies for the use of such reagents in the treatment of human neoplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of soluble or immobilized MAb directed at various additional surface proteins on the proliferation of highly purified T4 cells induced by two immobilized MAb to CD3, OKT3 and 64.1, was examined. High density 64.1 stimulated nearly all T4 cells to enter and progress through the cell cycle. Maximal T4 cell proliferation required stimulation with immobilized 64.1 throughout the length of the incubation and was not effected by any of the additional soluble or immobilized MAb employed. In contrast, low density immobilized 64.1 and all densities of immobilized OKT3 employed stimulated a minority of the cells to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Immobilized MAb directed at CD2, class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoded gene products or CD11a (LFA-1) dramatically enhanced the response, whereas soluble MAb directed at these determinants did not. Both immobilized and soluble MAb directed at CD5 and CD28 (Tp44) enhanced responses, but they were less effective than immobilized MAb to CD2, LFA-1 or HLA-A,B,C. Soluble anti-CD4 MAb inhibited responses somewhat, whereas immobilized anti-CD4 enhanced responses. Costimulation was observed when MAb to CD3 and class I MHC molecules but not CD2, LFA-1 or CD4 were immobilized to separate surfaces. The data suggest that when anti-CD3 stimulation is suboptimal, responses can be enhanced by MAb to CD5 or CD28 (Tp44) or by immobilized MAb to CD4, CD2, CD11a (LFA-1), or class I MHC encoded gene products. Although crosslinking of CD4, CD2, or CD11a with CD3 may be necessary for costimulation, immobilized MAb to CD3 and class I MHC molecules appear to deliver independent signals that result in enhanced T4 cell activation and proliferation.\r"

Sequence analysis of the amino acids in proteolyzed, native alpha-1-PI revealed a unique single cleavage site between Phe-352 and Leu-353. An analysis of the process regulating the enzyme's activity revealed that the neutrophil MP was released from cells in a latent form whose activation was tightly linked to the generation of hypochlorous acid. These results indicate that human neutrophils use chlorinated oxidants to activate a latent MP that is capable of proteolytically inactivating alpha-1-PI by cleaving the antiproteinase at a unique point in its inhibitory site region.\r"

Ninety-four percent of the patients achieved successful reperfusion, including 4% with failed angioplasty whose perfusion was maintained by means of a reperfusion catheter before emergency bypass surgery. The procedural mortality rate was 1.2% and the total in-hospital mortality rate was 11%. Ninety-two percent of surviving nonsurgical patients who underwent repeat cardiac catheterization were discharged from the hospital with an open infarct-related artery. The related cumulative 1 year survival rate for all patients managed with this treatment strategy was 87%, and the cardiac event-free survival rate was 84%. The 1 year survival for hospital survivors was 98% and the infarct-free survival rate was 94%. Multivariable analysis identified the following factors as independent predictors of subsequent cardiovascular death: cardiogenic shock, greater age, lower ejection fraction, female gender and a closed infarct-related vessel on the initial coronary angiogram. Among patients with cardiogenic shock, despite a 42% in-hospital mortality rate, only 4% died during the first year after hospital discharge. Similarly, the in-hospital and 1 year postdischarge mortality rates were 19 and 4%, respectively, for patients with an initial ejection fraction less than 40, and 25 and 3%, respectively, for patients greater than 65 years. An aggressive treatment strategy including early thrombolytic therapy, emergency cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and, when necessary, bypass surgery resulted in a high rate of infarct vessel patency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Coronary angioplasty is a widely applied revascularization procedure for patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, follow-up in this patient subgroup is relatively limited. From 1983 to 1986, coronary angioplasty was performed in 349 and 121 patients with, respectively, two- and three-vessel coronary disease with a primary success rate of 83 and 88%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 2.8% (13 of 470 patients). Complete revascularization was achieved in 128 patients. Among the 397 patients with a successful outcome, 373 (94%) were followed up greater than or equal to 1 year; 79% were free of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or the need for coronary bypass grafting, and 82% of patients had symptomatic improvement by at least one angina functional class. A second coronary angioplasty procedure was required in 13% of patients. After a mean follow-up period of 27 months, an increased incidence of coronary bypass grafting was noted in patients with incomplete versus complete revascularization (16 versus 7%, p less than 0.05). Among the 222 patients who had repeat cardiac catheterization performed an average of 7 months after angioplasty, 103 were symptomatic; 50% of the 222 patients had at least one vessel with greater than or equal to 50% restenosis and 14% of patients had multiple restenoses. In conclusion, coronary angioplasty can be performed with a high initial success rate and marked symptomatic improvement in patients with multivessel coronary disease. However, in this group's experience, the majority of patients selected for coronary angioplasty with multivessel coronary disease will have incomplete revascularization that can be predicted in the majority of patients before the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This finding contrasts with no differences seen in a previous study of the same populations at six months after the programs began (mean general satisfaction levels of 3.26 and 3.36 for the prepaid and fee-for-service patients, respectively). A statistically significant difference also existed in the subdimension \"technical aspects of quality of care\": 3.38 +/- 0.65 for prepaid patients, and 3.61 +/- 0.53 for fee-for-service service patients (P less than .05). Levels of satisfaction within other individual constructs were similar for both groups and tended to remain the same over two years, although satisfaction with access to care decreased among prepaid patients, and satisfaction with continuity of care increased among fee-for-service patients. These data support the hypothesis that overall satisfaction levels and certain aspects of patient satisfaction may be compromised by a capitation program.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between PWB and these seven physical health practices. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional health survey of 6320 persons. PWB was measured as an overall score, with positive feelings and negative feelings as subscores. Each of the three PWB measures was related to favorable health practices. The clinical significance of this relationship remains to be determined. In addition, PWB was noted to improve with age.

  ".W": "Clinical investigations using the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) to treat patients with advanced cancer have yielded encouraging results. We have thus sought ways to enhance the effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy while minimizing its toxic side effects. Murine experiments have identified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) as killer cells more effective than LAK cells and less dependent on adjunctive systemically administered IL-2 to mediate antitumor effects. Accordingly, we performed a pilot protocol to investigate the feasibility and practicality of administering IL-2-expanded TIL to humans with metastatic cancers. Twelve patients, including six with melanoma, four with renal cell carcinoma, one with breast carcinoma, and one with colon carcinoma, were treated with varying doses and combinations of TIL (8.0 X 10(9) to 2.3 X 10(11) cells per patient), IL-2 (10,000 to 100,000 U/kg three times daily to dose-limiting toxicity), and cyclophosphamide (CPM) (up to 50 mg/kg). Two partial responses (PR) to therapy were observed: pulmonary and mediastinal masses regressed in a patient with melanoma, and a lymph node mass regressed in a patient with renal cell carcinoma. One additional patient with breast cancer experienced a partial regression of disease in lymph nodal and cutaneous sites with complete elimination of malignant cells from a pleural effusion, although cutaneous disease recurred at 4 weeks. The toxicities of therapy were similar to those ascribed to IL-2; no toxic effects were directly attributable to TIL infusions. In five of six melanoma patients, TIL demonstrated lytic activity specific for the autologous tumor target in short-term chromium-release assays, distinct from the nonspecific lytic activity characteristic of LAK cells. This study represents an initial attempt to identify and use lymphocyte subsets with enhanced tumoricidal capacity in the adoptive immunotherapy of human malignancies.\r"

To investigate this problem in more detail, radiolabeled vitamin D and vitamin D metabolites were administered intravenously, which allowed determination of their relative plasma clearance rates. The study involved three groups of adult male chickens (five per group). Birds in group 1 were co-dosed with [3H]vitamin D2 and [3H]vitamin D3. Birds in group 2 were co-dosed with [3H]25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 and [3H]25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and birds in group 3 were co-dosed with [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2. The results indicated that the plasma turnover rate of [3H]vitamin D2 is 1.5 times faster than that of [3H]vitamin D3. Plasma turnover of the 25-hydroxylated metabolites differed, with [3H]25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 clearing faster (11 times) than [3H]25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The largest difference appeared in the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 turnover rates with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 clearing approximately 33 times faster then [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. These data, therefore, indicate that discrimination against vitamin D2 sterols in the chick occurs primarily between steps in the metabolism of vitamin D and not at the point of metabolism or excretion of the parent vitamin.\r"

Under tonic conditions (stimulation either every 1 or 2 min) high concentrations of diltiazem were required to enhance twitch tension (ED50 = 249 microM) and block calcium currents (IC50 = 190 microM). In addition, 100 microM diltiazem lowered the mechanical threshold rheobase potential from -49.3 to -57.0 mV. At higher rates of stimulation, concentrations of diltiazem as low as 1 and 10 microM, which had no tonic action, were found to produce twitch potentiation and calcium channel block, respectively. Onset and washout of tonic and frequency-dependent actions of diltiazem on twitch and current amplitude occurred over a similar time course. It is proposed that the mechanical potentiation, as well as the calcium channel block produced by diltiazem, result from the interaction of diltiazem with the same or similar receptor site(s).\r"

Single channel studies revealed that both oximes increased the opening probability of channels that were activated by acetylcholine. The oximes reduced mean channel open time and burst time in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner. End-plate current amplitude was increased by 2-PAM (10-100 microM) and HI-6 (1 microM) but depressed at higher concentrations of these agents. The oximes decreased the time constant of end-plate current decay, particularly at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. HI-6 depressed indirect twitch response of the sartorius muscle, whereas 2-PAM caused a facilitation followed by depression. Both agents directly hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine, in addition to weakly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Our study demonstrates a direct molecular interaction of the oximes HI-6 and 2-PAM with the natural agonist molecule and with the acetylcholine receptor-ion channel complex. These effects can explain the excitatory and inhibitory actions of both agents, and may form the basis for their antidotal effectiveness against organophosphorus poisoning. The quantitative differences between the effects of 2-PAM and HI-6 on the above parameters are important in view of their differential antidotal efficacies.\r"

In contrast, little or no effect of the anti-inflammatory steroids on the EGF-URO-mediated response was observed in the indomethacin-treated circular muscle preparation. Partial inhibition (about 30%) of the EGF-URO-mediated contraction of the indomethacin-sensitive longitudinal preparation was caused by mepacrine and p-bromophenyl-acylbromide, whereas esculetine, tranylcypromine, prazosin, yohimbine and cyproheptadine had no effect. The action of EGF-URO in both preparations exhibited marked tachyphyllaxis, which could not be attributed either to the production of inhibitory factors or to the disappearance of EGF-URO from the organ bath. The response of both preparations required the presence of extracellular calcium and was inhibited largely (90%, longitudinal preparation) or in part (69%, indomethacin-treated circular preparation) by verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, frog hearts did not show any delayed positive inotropic effect, whereas initial negative inotropic effect (25%) of L-methionine was seen. In subsequent studies using rat hearts, methionine was found to induce a dose-dependent increase in contractile force which correlated linearly (r = 0.93) with incorporation of methyl groups into tissue N-methylated phospholipids. The presence of adenosine, L-homocysteine thiolactone and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine mixture in the perfusion medium inhibited the contractile effects of L-methionine as well as the incorporation of 3H-methyl groups by about 75%. Cycloleucine, an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine synthase, and methyl acetimidate, a blocker of the phosphatidylethanolamine polar groups, inhibited phospholipid N-methylation and prevented the contractile changes due to L-methionine. The initial negative inotropic effect of methionine was attenuated by lowering the concentration of Na+, whereas the delayed positive inotropic effect was dependent on the concentration of Ca++ in the perfusion medium. Ryanodine, a blocker of the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca++ release, prevented the positive inotropic effect of methionine whereas verapamil, a well known Ca++ antagonist, blocked the initial depressant effect and reduced the delayed positive inotropic response. Marked alterations in the sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular calcium transport activities were seen upon perfusing the hearts with methionine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To improve the applicability of immunotoxins (ITs), we have developed a new two-step indirect procedure. The target cells to be killed are first incubated with cell-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). After removal of excess unbound antibody, the cells are incubated in the presence of lactose with an indirect IT, a conjugate of whole abrin and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (SAM) that binds only to cells having primary mouse MAbs on their surfaces. The SAM-abrin IT is affinity purified before use to remove molecules with exposed B-chain-binding sites; it was nontoxic in the absence of the specific mouse MAbs, demonstrating the specificity of the two-step method. We compared the indirect approach, using four different primary MAbs, with the conventional method, in which abrin is coupled directly to the mouse MAbs. In three human cell lines--the melanoma line FEMX, the Burkitt cell line Rael, and the leukemia cell line KM3--the cell kill, measured by a clonogenic assay, was consistently greater with the indirect than with the direct method. In the melanoma and Rael cells, the indirect method gave a higher cell kill than even native abrin. With a mixture of two different antibodies an additive effect was observed with the indirect but not with the direct method. The new approach greatly simplifies the therapeutic application in vitro of ITs, because it permits the use of different primary antibodies, singly or in mixtures, in conjunction with only one or a few general indirect ITs. In efforts to further improve the usefulness of the indirect method, other indirect ITs containing different toxin moieties are being examined. The possibility of employing the indirect principle in vivo is being explored.\r"

  ".U": "88214932\r", 
  ".W": "Almost all of the completed and ongoing phase III trials of the leucovorin/5-fluorouracil (LV/5-FU) combination have used either a single-agent 5-FU control arm in which the 5-FU was administered in a different schedule from the LV/5-FU arm or one in which the 5-FU was not at the maximally tolerated dose (MTD). Because both dose intensity and scheduling are known to affect drug activity, the LV/5-FU combination was evaluated in the preclinical CD8F1 murine model of advanced first-passage spontaneous breast tumors using the same dose (at MTD) and schedule for 5-FU alone and in the LV/5-FU combination arm. Overall, therapy with 5-FU at MTD was not improved by LV. Further, although the activity of 5-FU doses lower than the MTD could be increased by LV, the therapeutic result was comparable to that of single-agent 5-FU at MTD. In an evaluation with other modulators of 5-FU (e.g., uridine, PALA, methotrexate), therapy with various modulated 5-FU combinations at their MTD was not improved with LV. In conclusion, although LV can enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-FU in these in vivo preclinical studies, it does not confer enhanced selectivity to 5-FU, a conclusion at odds with many present clinical reports. Whether or not these murine findings have clinical relevance can be determined only by clinical trials designed with the MTD of 5-FU alone in the control arm, the MTD of 5-FU (or as close as tolerated) in the LV/5-FU arm, and identical schedules in both arms.\r"

Studies with Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Bjab 113 demonstrate that this immunotoxin is capable of killing 3 logs (99.9%) of clonogenic lymphoma cells after a 2-hour incubation. The presence of human bone marrow inhibits the activity of the conjugate. However, full potency of TEC IgM-SAP immunotoxin is restored by adding 1 mM amantadine to the incubation medium. The reaction is highly specific and is inhibited by the presence of excess anti-mu-antibody or human serum. Clonal growth of other Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines is inhibited to a lesser extent by the immunotoxin. The presence of surface IgM on the different cell lines is directly correlated to target cell killing by TEC IgM-SAP. Isolation of Bjab 113 clones surviving treatment demonstrates that only a minority are truly resistant and that the others randomly escape the treatment. The highly potent and specific activity of this conjugate in the presence of bone marrow buffy coat and its exceptionally rapid onset of action make this conjugate a good candidate for the ex vivo elimination of neoplastic cells from the bone marrow of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the effect of burn trauma on the in vivo leukocyte cell delivery during the first 24 hr of the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test reaction and a bacterial skin abscess. Inbred male Lewis rats sensitized to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were given a 30% scald burn or sham burn. Three days later the animals were injected intradermally, at different sites, with 0.3 mg of KLH, 10(8) organisms of S. aureus 502A, and 0.1 cc of saline, at 2 to 24 hr. Leukocytes labelled with Indium111 oxine(leu111) were injected intravenously. In sham rats the peak leu111 influx in the DTH reaction occurred at 2-4 hr while in the abscess it was biphasic with peaks at 3 hr and 6-8 hr. In burn trauma rats there was a markedly increased leu111 peak at 2 hr in both the DTH and abscess reactions followed by a significantly lower than normal leu111 delivery in the late (6-24) hours. This marked early leukocyte influx in burned rats was paralleled by a reduced DTH skin test lesion (8.2 +/- 1.1 mm to 4.2 +/- 1.1 mm) and an increased bacterial abscess (5.1 +/- 1.1 mm to 8.1 +/- 0.9 mm) post burn. There was a direct correlation between leukocyte cell delivery to a DTH reaction and a bacterial abscess (r8 = 0.69, Spearman rank; p less than 0.001). We conclude that burn trauma results in altered leukocyte delivery to inflammatory lesions and the DTH response can be used to assess the ability of a burn trauma host to recruit leukocytes at a site of infection.\r"

Cyclosporine A was started at 7 mg/kg/day and titrated to maintain HPLC level of 100 to 200 ng/ml. Of 20 patients, 14 had a complete remission and the remaining 6 had a reduction in their proteinuria. The mean serum albumin of the 14 responders rose from 2.1 g/dl to 4.1 g/dl (P less than 0.00001) after cyclosporine A therapy. The mean serum cholesterol of the 14 responders decreased from 394 mg/dl to 184 mg/dl (P less than 0.0001) after cyclosporine A therapy. The mean creatinine clearance of the 20 patients (104 ml/min/1.73 m2) was unchanged (107 ml/min/1.73 m2) after eight weeks of cyclosporine A. By life table analysis, 40% of the responders show a sustained remission of up to a year. Cyclosporine A responders had a higher T3 cell count prior to therapy compared to nonresponders (69 +/- 5.54% vs. 61 +/- 6.4%, P less than 0.02). Pre-therapy interleukin-2 levels measured in 10 patients were normal or supranormal in 8, 6 of whom were treatment responders. Two patients with low interleukin-2 levels were nonresponders. Cyclosporine A can be used to induce a remission in relapsing nephrotic patients, and short-term cyclosporine A therapy does not produce nephrotoxicity.\r"

The percentages of CD4-positive and CD8-positive T lymphocytes, and the CD4/CD8 ratios, were similar in the patients with acute severe asthma and the control groups, and were within the normal range. In contrast, patients with acute severe asthma had significant increases, compared with control subjects, of three surface proteins associated with T lymphocyte activation: interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R); class II histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR); and \"very late activation\" antigen (VLA-1). The IL-2R-positive T lymphocytes were exclusively of the CD4 \"helper-inducer\" phenotype. The percentages of IL-2R-positive and HLA-DR-positive (but not VLA-1-positive) lymphocytes tended to decrease as the patients were treated and clinically improved, although these values remained raised above control values for the observation period. Cell-mediated immunity may be causally related to the pathogenesis of acute severe asthma.\r"

Their charts were reviewed to determine the etiologies of the mononeuritis multiplex and to determine how often the laboratory examination revealed a rheumatic disease in patients whose initial history and physical examination did not suggest that a rheumatic disease was present. In 11/35 (31%; CI = 17-49) a disorder capable of causing mononeuritis multiplex was diagnosed before the symptoms of mononeuritis multiplex began. Ten had a rheumatic disease; 1 had lymphoma. Nine of the other patients were suspected, on the basis of the history and physical examination, of having new onset of a rheumatic disease. Subsequent laboratory evaluation showed that 5/9 (56%; CI = 21-86) had a rheumatic disease, and 4/9 (44%; CI = 14-79) were unknowns. In 15/35 (43%; CI = 26-61) patients with mononeuritis multiplex, no rheumatic disease was suspected on the basis of the initial history and physical examination. The subsequent laboratory examination revealed an underlying rheumatic disease in 0/15 (0%; CI = 0-18). Mean clinical follow-up of 16 +/- 16 months in the patients with mononeuritis multiplex of unknown cause also failed to identify a rheumatic disease. Overall 19/35 (54%; CI = 37-71) did not have a rheumatic disease or any other known cause. Of the 14 patients with mononeuritis multiplex associated with a rheumatic disease, 5/14 (36%; CI = 13-15) had systemic lupus erythematosus; an additional patient had both lupus and the CREST syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) indicate that the prevalence of goiter varies from 0 to 58% while that of hypothyroidism ranges from 0 to 9.5%. In addition, altered serum thyroid hormone levels are present in euthyroid patients with ESRD and may be related to nonthyroidal disorders including malnutrition. To examine these issues further, 306 patients with ESRD were compared to 139 hospitalized patients without renal disease (control population). Goiter was present in 43% with ESRD compared to 6.7% of controls (P less than 0.001). Goiter frequency was greater (49.6%, P = 0.047) and serum parathyroid hormone levels higher (mean: 238.6 microlitersEq/ml, P less than 0.001; normal: less than 15 microlitersEq/ml) in 115 patients dialyzed for longer than 1 year than in 191 dialyzed for less than 1 year or not at all (38.7%, and 61.5 microlitersEq/ml, respectively). In addition, goiter was more common in females (50.0%) than in males (35.1%, P = 0.008) with ESRD. No significant relationships were observed between goiter frequency and age, race, diabetes mellitus, or elevated antimicrosomal antibody titers. The prevalence of primary hypothyroidism was higher in ESRD (2.6%) than in 2122 in- and out-patients (1.1%) (P = 0.024). Compared to the total group of ESRD patients, the hypothyroid patients were predominantly female (88% vs. 50%) and had a higher frequency of positive antimicrosomal antibody titers (50% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.029). The frequency of hyperthyroidism was not significantly different, being 1.0% in ESRD compared to 0.3% in the general population (P = 0.057). There was a higher frequency of reduced free T4 index values in the 287 euthyroid patients with ESRD (12.9%) than in controls (3.6%) (P = 0.002). Similarly, free T3 index values were reduced below 100 in 65.5% with ESRD compared to 33.8% of controls (P less than 0.001). In addition, serum albumin levels were lower in euthyroid patients with ESRD (3.5 g/dl, P less than 0.001) than in controls (3.8 g/dl). Serum T3 levels correlated directly with both serum albumin (r = 0.57, P less than 0.001) and transferrin (r = 0.54, P less than 0.001) levels in ESRD as well as in controls (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001, and r = 0.69, P less than 0.001, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the clinical and immunologic effects of intravenous cyclophosphamide in this setting, we treated nine patients with monthly intravenous infusions of cyclophosphamide for six months. A comparison of characteristics at entry and follow-up revealed improvements (by paired t-test) in creatinine clearance (66 vs. 96 ml per minute, P less than 0.001); 24-hour urinary protein level (4.11 vs. 0.90 g, P less than 0.05), Farr anti-DNA titer (43 vs. 8.5 percent, P less than 0.01); complement components C3 (894 vs. 1150 mg per liter, P less than 0.05), C4 (154 vs. 222 mg per liter, P less than 0.05), and total complement activity (CH50) (88.7 vs. 113.4 IU, P less than 0.05); and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (60.2 vs. 34.4 mm per hour, P less than 0.0005). Other manifestations of lupus improved markedly in most cases, despite a reduction in the mean daily dose of prednisone, from 45 mg at entry to 17 mg at follow-up (P less than 0.01). The numbers of lymphocytes positive for T3, T4, T8, and B1 declined progressively during treatment. At follow-up, persistent decreases were observed in the T-lymphocyte subsets, whereas the absolute number of B lymphocytes had returned to levels near base line. T-cell proliferative responses at follow-up were not significantly different from entry values, except that the response to mitogenic anti-T11 (CD2) antibodies was decreased (P less than 0.01). Our data indicate that monthly intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide was associated with a substantial amelioration of severe systemic lupus, in conjunction with discrete changes in T-lymphocyte markers and T-cell function. This was a preliminary, uncontrolled study, but the results warrant further investigation of this form of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Antinuclear antibodies develop in most patients who are given prolonged procainamide therapy, but clinical symptoms resembling those of lupus appear in only 15 to 20 percent of such persons. No objective marker for symptomatic procainamide-induced lupus has been described. However, IgG antibodies to the histone complex H2A-H2B have previously been reported in this disorder, and it has been suggested that antiguanosine antibodies may be a marker for major manifestations of procainamide-induced lupus. We therefore tested for these antibodies in 20 symptomatic and 31 asymptomatic patients treated with procainamide. Most of the symptomatic patients had multiple manifestations of drug-induced lupus; resolution of symptoms after the discontinuation of procainamide was required for inclusion in the symptomatic group. All 20 symptomatic patients had elevated IgG antibodies to H2A-H2B, in contrast to only 2 asymptomatic patients (P less than 0.001). This activity was absent in patients not treated with procainamide and in patients with lupus induced by hydralazine or quinidine. IgG antiguanosine was elevated as compared with normal controls in 13 of 20 symptomatic and 19 of 31 asymptomatic patients--a finding that did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. We conclude that IgG antibodies to H2A-H2B are a sensitive and specific marker for procainamide-induced lupus. The striking correlation between antibodies to H2A-H2B and symptomatic disease suggests a possible association between this antibody and the underlying pathogenic events.\r"

  ".W": "Differentiation of bone marrow derived precursors into mature T cells takes place in the thymus. During differentiation, T cells develop the receptor repertoire which allows them to recognize antigen in the context of self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Mature T helper cells (mostly CD4+ CD8-) recognize antigen in the context of class II MHC molecules, whereas cytotoxic T cells (mostly CD4-CD8+) recognize antigen in the context of class I MHC determinants. Thymic MHC-encoded determinants greatly influence the selection of the T-cell receptor repertoire. In addition to positive selection, a negative selection to eliminate self-reactive T-cell clones is thought to occur in the thymus, but how this 'education' occurs is not well understood. It has been suggested that during differentiation an interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and MHC-encoded determinants occurs, leading to the selection of an MHC-restricted receptor repertoire. In support of this hypothesis, class-II-specific, CD4+ CD8- helper T cells fail to develop in mice neonatally treated with anti-class II monoclonal antibody (mAb). As CD4-CD8+ cells differ from the CD4+ CD8- lineage (in function, MHC-restriction specificity and perhaps site of education) we examined whether interactions with MHC determinants are also necessary for the development of class-I-specific T cells. Here we show that mice chronically treated with anti-class I mAb from birth lack CD4-CD8+ cells and cytotoxic T-cell precursors, indicating that most CD4-CD8+ T cells need interaction with class I MHC molecules during differentiation.\r"

We show here that the structural gene epiA encoding the antibiotic epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis is located on a 54-kilobase plasmid and codes for a 52-amino-acid prepeptide, which is processed to the tetracyclic 21-peptide amide antibiotic. The mature sequence of epidermin corresponds to the C-terminal 22-peptide segment of pre-epidermin and contains the precursor amino acids Ser, Thr and Cys, from which the unusual amino-acid constituents are derived. The more lipophilic epidermin is cleaved at a hydrophilic turn between Arg-1 and Ile+1 from the N-terminal segment-30 to -1, which probably assumes a partially amphiphilic alpha-helix conformation. We propose that the N-terminus (-30 to -1) plays a cooperative role during modification reactions and prevents toxicity of the mature epidermin to the producing strain before the antibiotic is cleaved off and secreted.\r"

  ".W": "AIDS is an immunoregulatory disorder characterized by depletion of the CD4+, helper/inducer lymphocyte population. The causative agent of this disease is the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, which infects CD4+ cells and leads to cytopathic effects characterized by syncytia formation and cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that binding of HIV to its cellular receptor CD4 is necessary for viral entry. We find that binding of HIV to CD4 induces rapid and sustained phosphorylation of CD4 which could involve protein kinase C. HIV-induced CD4 phosphorylation can be blocked by antibody against CD4 and monoclonal antibody against the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, indicating that a specific interaction between CD4 and gp120 is required for phosphorylation. Electron microscopy shows that a protein kinase C inhibitor does not impair binding of HIV to CD4+ cells, but causes an apparent accumulation of virus particles at the cell surface, at the same time inhibiting viral infectivity. These results indicate a possible role for HIV-induced CD4 phosphorylation in viral entry and identify a potential target for antiviral therapy.\r"

All 16 were considered normal by their parents and were doing well in school. A complete neurologic and psychometric evaluation was performed on 13 of these children. No child had significant neurologic deficit, although four had minor neurologic abnormalities. Psychometric testing revealed normal performance IQ scores (104.3 +/- 15.8) but low verbal IQ scores (91.8 +/- 18.4); however, these lower verbal IQ scores can be explained by the proportion of Hispanic and bilingual children in this sample. Therefore, there is no evidence that any of these 16 children have any serious neurologic damage as a result of a convulsion or a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode temporally associated with a prior diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization.\r"

  ".W": "The need for a reliable screening test for classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia prompted development of newborn screening programs. Worldwide incidence of classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia in this report was taken from newborn screening programs in France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Scotland, and the United States. Two populations in which the occurrence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia among live births has been reported with greater than usual frequency are the Yupik Eskimos of southwestern Alaska (1:282) and the people of La Reunion, France (1:2,141). Aside from these populations, 1,093,310 newborns were screened between 1980 and 1988, of whom 77 had congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Thus, worldwide incidence of this disorder was estimated at 1:14,199 live births for homozygous patients, 1:60 for heterozygous subjects, with a gene frequency of 0.0083. Incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia among whites was estimated to be 1:11,909 (41:488,279) for homozygous patients, 1:55 for heterozygous subjects with a gene frequency of 0.0091. Incidence for the salt-wasting form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia was 1:18,850 (58:1,093,310) compared with 1:57,543 (19:1,093,310) for congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the simple virilizing form. Thus, salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia was three times more common than simple virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Estimated incidence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in white populations in Italy and France (1:10,866) was higher than in Scotland (1:17,098), New Zealand (1:14,500). The incidence in an Asian population (Japan) (1:15,800) did not differ significantly from that of the white population. In four of five populations, overall incidence was higher than previously reported, as was the frequency of the salt-wasting form (75% v 50% to 66%), suggesting improved case detection by newborn screening.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unlike any CaM-dependent multifunctional protein kinase described previously, the native enzyme from Aspergillus behaves as a monomer. The calculated molecular weight is 41,200. NaDodSO4/PAGE reveals a single protein band with an apparent Mr of 51,000. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/NaDodSO4/PAGE of the purified enzyme showed one major and one minor more acidic Coomassie blue-stained spot, both of which bind 125I-labeled calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner. The kinase is autophosphorylated in a calcium- and CaM-dependent manner, yielding an increase in the amount and number of more acidic forms of the enzyme. The Aspergillus kinase catalyzes the Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of known substrates of type II Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, including glycogen synthase, microtubule-associated protein 2, synapsin, tubulin, gizzard myosin light chain, and casein. Cross-reactivity between antiserum raised against native rat brain protein kinase II and 125I-labeled Aspergillus kinase has been detected. Two forms of CaM have been isolated from Aspergillus nidulans, both of which activate the Aspergillus kinase at lower concentrations than that required for activation by bovine brain CaM.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 3 (IL-3) is required for the survival and proliferation of the FDCP-Mix 1 multipotent stem cell line. IL-3 or phorbol esters can rapidly translocate protein kinase C from a cytosolic to a membrane-bound form in these cells. Phorbol esters were able to partially replace the requirement of FDCP-Mix 1 cells for IL-3. Down-modulation of protein kinase C levels by chronic treatment with phorbol ester markedly reduced the ability of the cells to proliferate in response to either IL-3 or phorbol esters. These data indicate that IL-3 can activate protein kinase C, leading to the survival and proliferation of stem cells. Protein kinase C is activated conventionally by complexing with diacylglycerol which accumulates in the cell membrane after agonist-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2]. However, there was no detectable breakdown of PtdIns(4,5)P2 when IL-3 was added to FDCP-Mix 1 cells, nor was there detectable accumulation of inositol phosphates in response to IL-3. In contrast, rapid hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and accumulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was elicited by readdition of horse serum to serum-starved cells, thus indicating that these cells possess the necessary machinery to undergo agonist-mediated inositol phospholipid breakdown. We conclude that the mechanism whereby IL-3 can activate protein kinase C leading to proliferation is not associated with inositol phospholipid hydrolysis.\r"

By using RNA sequence analysis, immunoprecipitation, and competition experiments with in vitro synthesized fragments of U1 RNA, a region of 40 nucleotides representing a stem-loop secondary structure was found to be an immunoreactive domain. This antibody recognized a conformational epitope because neither the RNA stem nor the RNA loop alone was immunoprecipitable. Antisense U1 RNA, U1 DNA, and other small RNAs were not reactive with the antibody. While the origins of nucleic acid-binding antibodies are unknown, this RNA-specific autoantibody probably originated by direct presentation to the immune system or as an anti-idiotype against a more common U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-specific autoantibody. Thus, these findings have implications for the mechanisms of autoimmune recognition and provide an immunological approach to probing RNA structure and protein-RNA interactions.\r"

The cDNA contains an open reading frame that codes for a protein of 1106 amino acids. Comparison to the mouse PDGF receptor reveals an overall amino acid sequence identity of 86%. This sequence identity rises to 98% in the cytoplasmic split tyrosine kinase domain. RNA blot hybridization analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from human dermal fibroblasts detects a major (approximately 5.7 kb) and a minor (approximately 4.8 kb) transcript using the cDNA as a probe. Baby hamster kidney cells, transfected with an expression vector containing the receptor cDNA, express an approximately equal to 190-kDa cell surface protein that is recognized by an anti-human PDGF receptor antibody. The recombinant PDGF receptor is functional in the transfected baby hamster kidney cells as demonstrated by ligand-induced phosphorylation of the receptor. Binding properties of the recombinant PDGF receptor were also assessed with pure preparations of BB and AB isoforms of PDGF (i.e., PDGF dimers composed of two B chains or an A and a B chain). Unlike human dermal fibroblasts, which bind both isoforms with high affinity, the transfected baby hamster kidney cells bind only the BB isoform of PDGF with high affinity. This observation is consistent with the existence of more than one PDGF receptor class.\r"

By analyzing the segregation pattern of the gene in 75 offspring from an interspecific backcross a single genetic locus, Um, was defined on chromosome 8. Recombination frequency between Um and the co-segregating loci serum esterase 1 (Es-1) and tyrosine aminotransferase (Tat) places Um about 14 centimorgan (cM) distal to Es-1, and 5 cM proximal to Tat. In situ hybridization of uvomorulin [3H]cDNA to mouse metaphase chromosomes located the Um locus close to the distal end of chromosome 8 (bands C3-E1). Since uvomorulin is evolutionarily highly conserved, its chromosomal assignment adds an important marker to the mouse genetic map.\r"

During development, lymphoid cells assemble functional variable (V) region genes for each receptor chain from separate multimember gene families by somatic DNA rearrangements of individual germ-line segments. Transcription may play a role in regulating the tissue and stage specificity of these rearrangements by controlling the accessibility of germ-line loci to the recombinational machinery. Immunoglobulin V-region genes are transcribed from tissue-specific promoters that have been well characterized. We report here the characterization of 14 T-cell receptor beta-chain V-region gene promoters. Sequence analysis indicates that these promoters do not contain the conserved octamer that is located upstream of all immunoglobulin genes. However, a unique decanucleotide sequence, not present in immunoglobulin genes, is conserved in the promoter region of murine and human V beta genes. We identify this sequence as a potential regulatory element, based on its position, conservation, and sequence homology to sites known to bind transcription-activating factors. The possibility that the distinct structures of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene promoters may contribute to the tissue-specific rearrangement and expression of receptor gene families is discussed.\r"

Both syncytial formation (viral-induced cell fusion) and premature cell death have been cited as the major cause for this phenomenon. By kinetic analysis of cell proliferation and cell lysis we show that the cytopathic effect correlates chiefly with virus production from infected cells, including giant syncytial cells. Most T4 cells were, at least transiently, infected by human immunodeficiency virus (human T-lymphotropic virus type IIIB strain); however, after phytohemagglutinin activation, only 10-30% of infected cells express virus (and die) at any one time, indicating that virus production, followed by cell killing, is linked to immune activation and cell differentiation. We also show that an interval exists before viral release, in which expression of viral antigens occurs on the cell surface, suggesting that infected cells are immunogenic before viral production. If so, they may induce a cell-mediated immune response that could minimize dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus, a possibility that has influenced our approaches to the development of a vaccine for prevention of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

In this communication, we have examined one specific case of neurologic disorder that can be classified as multiple sclerosis or tropical spastic paraparesis. The patient suffering from chronic neurologic disorder was found to contain antibodies to HTLV-I envelope and gag proteins in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Lymphocytes from peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of the patient were shown to express viral RNA sequences by in situ hybridization. Southern blot analysis of the patient lymphocyte DNA revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences. Blot-hybridization analysis of the RNA from fresh peripheral lymphocytes stimulated with interleukin 2 revealed the presence of abundant amounts of genomic viral RNA with little or no subgenomic RNA. We have cloned the proviral genome from the DNA of the peripheral lymphocytes and determined its restriction map. This analysis shows that this proviral genome is very similar if not identical to that of the prototype HTLV-I genome.\r"

Several monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor complex were tested for their ability to elicit transmembrane signaling in the parental Jurkat line and in a somatic mutant (J.CaM1) with a deficient receptor function. One antibody elicited substantial early Ca2+ mobilization responses in both cells but was unable to promote expression of the interleukin-2 gene in J.CaM1. In J.CaM1 there was a diminished production of phosphatidylinositol second messengers, and the elevation in intracellular free Ca2+ was transient.

With current diagnostic techniques, combined with the neurosurgical and otologic team approach, the majority of patients with acoustic tumors of all sizes may expect a complete resection of the tumor with a good outcome. Certainly, early diagnosis and resection of smaller tumors will increase the likelihood that hearing will be preserved, thus providing impetus for aggressive diagnostic and surgical treatment of patients with these lesions.\r"

There was no significant difference between induction times for the propofol (40.0 +/- 2.0 sec) and thiopental (44.0 +/- 4.0 sec) groups. Propofol administration produced a significant fall (P less than .05) in systolic blood pressure (SBP), from 134.1 +/- 2.6 mm Hg before injection to 128.3 +/- 2.4, 118.2 +/- 2.7, and 114.4 +/- 2.8 mm Hg one, two, and three minutes after injection, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) fell significantly (P less than .05) during the three postinjection periods. Heart rate (HR) rose significantly (P less than .05), from 78.6 +/- 3.1 beats per minute before injection to 89.4 +/- 3.4 beats per minute one minute after injection.

The DBP did not change significantly in the thiopental group, but the HR rose significantly (P less than .05), from 73.3 +/- 2.8 beats per minute before injection to 83.9 +/- 3.0, 90.1 +/- 2.3, and 84.2 +/- 2.4 beats per minute one, two, and three minutes after injection, respectively. In 94% of patients given propofol, there were apneic periods of more than 60 seconds, compared to 50% in the thiopental group (P less than .05). There was a significant difference (P less than .05) between groups for the incidence of pain on injection; 31% of the patients receiving propofol had pain, compared to 3% of those receiving thiopental.\r"

This technique uses a low flip angle, a fast repetition rate, and gradient-refocused echoes to produce images in which the signal of flowing blood within even small vascular structures (e.g., CABGs) is enhanced. Twenty-eight CABGs were evaluated by using both cine MR imaging and coronary angiography (as \"gold standard\"), and the MR images were interpreted blindly for determination of patency or occlusion of the CABGs. The sensitivity of cine MR imaging for determination of CABG patency was 93%, the specificity was 86%, and the overall predictive accuracy was 89%. Because cine MR imaging facilitates the identification of patent vascular structures by enhancing the signal intensity of flowing blood, this technique seems particularly attractive for noninvasively determining CABG patency.\r"

Lithotripsy failed in two patients with cystic duct stones. The seven patients with successful lithotripsy underwent subsequent fragment extraction by intervention via T-tube tract, minicholecystostomy, or endoscopic sphincterotomy. Our approach to cholelithotripsy varied from previous reports in that we included patients with cystic duct stones, relied on interventional fragment removal without adjuvant chemolitholysis, and treated four patients with acute symptoms or multiple risk factors. Our initial experience with biliary lithotripsy in selected patients indicates that it can play an integral part in nonsurgical intervention for cholelithiasis.\r"

Of 12 patients studied, eight had hepatic metastases, two had hepatocellular carcinoma, and two had bile-duct carcinoma. Focal changes in liver morphology (i.e., atrophy with compensatory hypertrophy) were found in five patients at presentation and developed after treatment with systemic or intraarterial chemotherapy in the others. Atrophic changes affected the right lobe in eight patients, the left lobe in three, and part of both lobes in one. Compensatory hypertrophy of part or all of the unaffected liver was found. Ten patients had obstruction of the portal vein branch to the atrophic segment, four of these 10 also had hepatic vein obstruction, and two of these 10 also had bile duct obstruction. Portal vein obstruction appears to be the most important element in the production of focal hepatic atrophy in patients with hepatic neoplasms. After treatment with chemotherapy, tumor regression and atrophy may be associated with compensatory hypertrophy and enlargement of the uninvolved part of the liver. This must not be mistaken for progression of disease.\r"

One-half of the abscesses were 2-6 cm in diameter; 11% measured 13-16 cm. An enhancing wall was present in most cases. An incomplete rim of edema was seen in eight abscesses. The margin of the abscess was smooth in 63% and nodular in 37%. Internal septations were noted in 30%. Four patients had focal intrahepatic biliary dilatation peripheral to an abscess. One patient had intraabscess hemorrhage. Extrahepatic abnormalities were present in 18 patients; right pleural effusion (nine), perihepatic fluid collection (five), gastric or colonic involvement (eight), and retroperitoneal extension (one). Gas within an abscess was due to hepatobronchial fistula in one patient and hepatocolic fistula in another. Amebic abscess should be included in the differential diagnosis when CT shows one or more cystic or complex masses in the liver, especially when there is evidence of extrahepatic extension.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference in the subjects' tolerance to the two regimens. There was, however, a significant improvement in ability to distinguish the head of the pancreas from the duodenal C-loop when the fat-density contrast material was given. When pancreaticoduodenal discrimination was graded, patients given corn-oil emulsion and metoclopramide received an average score of 0.94, whereas those given the high-density agent received an average score of 0.74, with 1.00 being the highest possible score (p less than .005). These data suggest that for routine CT evaluation of the head of the pancreas, a combination of corn-oil emulsion and metoclopramide may be superior to the conventional high-density oral contrast agents given without metoclopramide.\r"

The magnitude of hyoid movements, however, has not been quantitated with respect to the volume of the swallowed bolus. In this study, we determined the magnitude of superior and anterior movements of the hyoid associated with swallows of barium of different volumes. Lateral videoradiographic images of 2- to 20-ml boluses of barium were obtained in 15 subjects who had no pharyngoesophageal symptoms and had normal pharyngoesophageal motor function. Analysis indicated that a significant direct correlation existed between the volume of the swallowed bolus and the magnitude of the superior and anterior movements of the hyoid. For example, the mean values for these respective movements were 13.0 +/- 5 mm and 13.5 +/- 6 mm for a 2-ml bolus, compared with 14.8 +/- 5 mm and 16.7 +/- 5 mm for a 10-ml bolus. The findings indicate that values of deglutitive movement of the hyoid need to be indexed to the volume of the swallowed bolus. The results imply that the neural program in the brainstem that generates the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing is not completely stereotyped, but rather is modulated by volume-dependent sensory feedback.\r"

The presenting clinical symptoms in this group of patients were often misleading, and in only one of the eight cases was the correct clinical diagnosis made at the time of admission. Of the three diagnostic studies that were performed (barium enema, sonography, and CT), barium enema was the most accurate, yielding evidence for diverticulitis in six of seven cases. The degree and extent of diverticulosis in these patients was minimal compared with that in the older patients. CT showed abdominal abscesses in two patients; in one, a mistaken diagnosis of Crohn disease was made; in the other, diverticulitis was correctly identified. In the three patients in whom sonography was performed, the findings were negative for diverticulitis. Our experience suggests that the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis should be considered in patients with abdominal pain who are less than 40 years old.\r"

The CT scans of 145 cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm and seven cases of abdominal aortic aneurysm with dissection were analyzed with respect to the location of the calcification: mural only or mural and thrombus. Mural calcification was seen in all 152 patients with aneurysms whereas thrombus calcification was identified in only 33 (24%) of the 136 patients with thrombus. Displaced intimal calcification caused by aortic dissection can either appear similar to or, at times, be indistinguishable from thrombus calcification. Thrombus calcification was present in four (57%) of the seven patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms and dissection. To avoid the possibility of a false-positive diagnosis of aortic dissection in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, other signs of aortic dissection should be sought such as separation of the true and false lumina by an intimal flap.\r"

Stress and anxiety have been considered important factors, but no prospective evaluation of their impact on ECG alterations has been reported. In order to separate ECG changes resulting from anxiety associated with the procedure itself from those caused by the contrast agent, ECG monitoring was done during IV urography, first when patients were given saline and then again during and after contrast infusion. In both circumstances, the patients were told that they were being given contrast material. One hundred fifty patients undergoing infusion excretory urography with meglumine diatrizoate were studied. Preliminary 12-lead ECGs identified those with initially normal (71) and abnormal (79) tracings. Lead II rhythm strip ECGs were then obtained at 1 and 3 min during a saline infusion and again during contrast infusion; final 12-lead ECGs were done after the contrast infusion. During contrast infusion, PR prolongation (greater than 0.02 sec) occurred in 44% of patients, a change in heart rate (greater than +/- 10 beats/min) occurred in 26%, and benign arrhythmias (premature atrial and ventricular contractions, less than 5/min) occurred in 9%. Saline alone caused no statistically significant ECG alterations (only a single instance of premature atrial contractions). The hypothesis that stress or anxiety may adversely affect ECG reactivity in IV urography is unproved. Although we do not offer proof that it cannot occur, we found no evidence in a study of 150 patients to confirm that stress is an important factor. Only the contrast agent, not saline, produced measurable ECG changes during urography.\r"

Thirty-five patients with suspected meniscal tears were studied with fast-scan imaging (3DFT-GRASS), and the results were compared with those of conventional spin-echo imaging. Three-millimeter contiguous sections through the entire knee were obtained in 5 min by using the 3DFT-GRASS technique. 3DFT-GRASS and spin-echo images agreed in all cases regarding the presence or absence of an abnormality and its degree of severity. We conclude that fast-scan 3DFT-GRASS MR imaging is useful when screening the knee for the presence of meniscal abnormalities.\r"

Our method of intussusception reduction uses oxygen at a flow rate of 2 l/min and with a maximum pressure of 80 mm Hg. The results of 65 consecutive patients with 69 episodes of intussusception over a 9-month period were retrospectively reviewed. For eight episodes, gas enema was not used, including six patients who had barium reduction during the introduction of the gas technique and two patients in whom no intussusception was seen during gas enema were excluded. In the remaining 61 episodes, six patients were considered to be unacceptable risks for attempted therapeutic reduction with either oxygen or barium, according to our current criteria, and had primary surgery. Enemas with oxygen were attempted in 55 cases and were successful in 40 (73%). If all 61 cases with confirmed intussusception are included, the overall success rate with oxygen was 66%. We had greater success with oxygen than with barium (73% vs 53%), although identical pressures were used and the number of severely ill patients referred for therapeutic enema (90% vs 60%) had increased. The change in the referral pattern reflects the adoption of less conservative criteria for excluding patients from having therapeutic enema. No complications have occurred to date. We have had greater success with the use of oxygen than with that of barium, and have had no complications. Therefore, at our institution, oxygen has superseded barium for the therapeutic reduction of ileocolic intussusception.\r"

T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted images were obtained in all cases. T1-weighted images most accurately showed the margins of the seventh and eighth nerves in the internal auditory canal and were most sensitive in detecting small tumors in the cerebellopontine angle. Differentiation of meningioma from acoustic neurinoma by MR was provided most reliably by separation of the meningioma from the porus acusticus and seventh and eighth nerves and not by signal-intensity differences. A hypointense vascular rim was noted on MR in seven of 13 extracanalicular acoustic tumors and in three of seven meningiomas.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen patients with partially calcified intracranial lesions, as documented by CT, were evaluated with MR imaging at 1.5 T. All patients were imaged with both conventional spin-echo techniques and reduced flip-angle gradient-echo-acquisition (GEA) sequences, during which a signal is acquired in the absence of a 180 degrees radiofrequency pulse. GEA parameters were implemented so that T2* effects were maximized on these scans. In all 17 patients GEA images showed marked hypointensity throughout the entire area of calcification, matching the calcified region as seen on CT. In contrast, spin-echo findings in the calcified portions of the lesions were extremely variable, precluding confident identification of calcification on these images. The depiction of regions of calcification as marked hypointensity on GEA images can be ascribed to T2* shortening from static local magnetic field gradients at interfaces of regions differing in magnetic susceptibility, a phenomenon that is well documented in vitro, when various diamagnetic solids are placed in aqueous suspension. However, we cannot exclude the possible additional role of accompanying paramagnetic ions, which sometimes are present with diamagnetic calcium salts in various intracranial calcifications. Since the hypointensity due to calcification on GEA images is not specific, noncontrast CT could be used to confirm its presence. Although this lack of specificity and the artifacts that emanate from diamagnetic susceptibility gradients at or near air-brain interfaces somewhat limit the application of GEA techniques, we suggest that rapid MR imaging using GEA sequences can consistently demonstrate intracranial calcification, and that this technique thus seems to be a useful adjunct to conventional spin-echo imaging.\r"

There were 32 de novo osteosarcomas (11 maxillary, 13 mandibular, and eight cranial) and 14 postradiation osteosarcomas. All the maxillary tumors originated from the alveolar ridge, and the majority of mandibular lesions began in the body of the mandible. The postradiation osteosarcomas occurred in portions of bones at the borders of the radiation field; the latent period ranged from 4 years, 2 months to 50 years (mean, 14 years). The majority of de novo or postradiation craniofacial osteosarcomas were osteolytic with a long transition zone and no periosteal reaction; the exception was in the mandible, where nearly half the cases were osteoblastic and periosteal reaction was occasionally present. Tumor matrix mineralization occurred in more than 75% of the cases, and osteoid matrix calcification was most frequent, even though most tumors were chondroblastic. Soft-tissue extension of tumor was present in all cases and contained calcifications in more than half. Conventional radiographs are of limited value in evaluating head and neck osteosarcomas because of the superimposed bony structures. CT provides excellent detection of tumor calcification, cortical involvement, and, in most instances, soft-tissue and intramedullary extension. MR is even more effective in demonstrating the intramedullary and extraosseous tumor components on both T1- and T2-weighted images. However, CT and plain films are superior to MR in detecting the matrix calcifications and bone destruction or reaction.\r"

Direct axial and coronal CT sections are quite satisfactory for imaging the anatomy of the temporal bone; however, many relationships of the normal and pathologic anatomic detail of the temporal bone are better seen with direct sagittal CT sections. The sagittal projection is of interest to surgeons, as it has the advantage of following the plane of surgical approach. This article describes the advantages of using direct sagittal sections for studying various diseases of the temporal bone. The CT sections were obtained with the aid of a new head holder added to our GE CT 9800 scanner. The direct sagittal projection was found to be extremely useful for evaluating diseases involving the vertical segment of the facial nerve canal, vestibular aqueduct, tegmen tympani, sigmoid sinus plate, sinodural angle, carotid canal, jugular fossa, external auditory canal, middle ear cavity, infra- and supralabyrinthine air cells, and temporomandibular joint.\r"

  ".W": "Myringotomy with placement of a tympanostomy tube is a common surgical procedure. Although CT is not performed to evaluate these tubes, recognizing and accurately reporting their presence are important for a number of reasons. These include misidentification of the tube as a foreign body or a dislocated ossicle, misidentification of debris or normal ossicles as a tympanostomy tube, confirmation of the presence of a tube not seen on otoscopic evaluation, stimulation of careful search for cholesteatoma, and documentation of intervention. The purpose of this study is to show the CT appearance of tympanostomy tubes and to determine factors that make their identification on CT difficult. We reviewed all CT studies of the temporal bone performed over a 1-year period to determine the presence and appearance of tympanostomy tubes. Of the 118 CT scans evaluated, 19 patients (16%) had 34 tympanostomy tubes; of these 34 tubes, 13 (38%) had CT features that hindered identification of the tubes. Factors that resulted in obscured tubes, in order of frequency, included surrounding fluid, technical problems such as motion and artifacts, and atypical location. By knowing the appropriate location and CT appearance of tympanostomy tubes, misidentification of the tubes can be avoided.\r"

The CAPD subject group had a higher quality of life, lower illness and modality related stress scores, and nonsignificantly lower mood disturbance scores. The groups did not differ in self-esteem or health locus of control. CAPD subjects reported higher frequency of participation in community activities, better relationships with dialysis physicians and patients, and were more likely to be currently vocationally active. Dialysis modality likely exerts an independent effect on the quality of life of chronic dialysis patients, and CAPD is likely superior to CHD in this regard. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the relative role of patient-selection and modality-related factors in determining the psychological and social adaptation (quality of life) of chronic dialysis patients.\r"

Significant early leukopenia was found with a cuprophane membrane, while a cellulose acetate membrane was associated with mild early leukopenia. Bath composition had no effect. Bicarbonate dialysate, compared with acetate, eliminated hypoxemia in cellulose acetate membranes and reduced its degree and duration with cuprophane. Membrane composition had no effect on hypoxemia during acetate dialysis. The findings indicate that leukopenia is directly and exclusively related to membrane composition while hypoxemia only relates in part to membrane effects. Serial determinations of complement components C3a and C5a showed significant increases in parallel with leukopenia during heparin anticoagulation, but the anaphylatoxin concentration changes were dissociated during dialysis with citrate anticoagulation. The concentrations of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a appear not to be directly related to dialysis-induced leukopenia. The dissociation between anaphylatoxin concentrations and leukopenia may be related to changes in generation or unmasked changes in leukocyte response. Citrate anticoagulation may provide a useful probe for further studies on membrane-leukocyte interactions in vivo.\r"

In the present study the gene frequency was found to be .103 +/- .020 in an ethnically pooled sample and was as high as .223 +/- .062 among Ashkenazi Jews. Second, the segregation analysis of families ascertained through a nonclassical 21-OHD proband and those ascertained through a classical 21-OHD proband showed essentially identical results. A partial recessive model with no recombination between 21-OHD and HLA-B fitted the data better than did a complete recessive model with approximately 0.5% recombination between 21-OHD and HLA-B. The support for the partial over the complete recessive model depended on the assumed ascertainment probability, an unknown parameter in these data. Four families provided most of the evidence against the complete recessive model. All these included an unaffected sib who shared both HLA-B specificities in common with the affected proband. Possible explanations for the condition in these families include recombination, gene conversion, mutation in one of the parental gametes, or technical errors.\r"

Several different RFLPs were identified with 15 different restriction enzymes. Two RFLPs detected with the restriction enzyme BamHI and one multiallelic RFLP detected with BclI were used for further studies. Linkage relationships between these three polymorphisms and the HLA complex were studied in DNA samples from the 40 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families. Combining all of the data to form highly informative haplotypes, we found linkage to HLA with a maximum lod score of 11.44 at a recombination fraction of .25 for males and .35 for females. These three RFLPs at the FXIIIa locus provide a highly informative marker for the short arm of chromosome 6 with an observed heterozygosity of 91%. Using this marker and the HLA locus, one can confirm or exclude the assignment of gene loci to most of chromosome 6p.\r"

Sixty-nine patients reported no symptoms of night blindness and 116 patients claimed no visual field changes; 90 stated that they saw better at dusk. The most common problem noted by 263 (53.3%) was headaches, 31 on a daily basis, 42 at least weekly, 124 infrequently, and the remainder nonspecifically. Numbness or tingling, mainly in extremities, was reported by 99 patients. The second most common problem affecting 170 patients (34.6%) was light flashes; since eight patients had retinal detachments, light flashes cannot be totally discounted.

The overall patency rate was 81 percent at 4.47 years. There were 3.5 complications per graft and 1 procedure per 1.25 years of follow-up. Over two thirds of the grafts had minimal complications and showed a 95 percent patency rate at 4.76 years.

  ".W": "To examine the role of chronic calcium entry blocking drug administration on perioperative myocardial ischemia and, specifically, the frequency of hemodynamically unrelated ischemia, the authors studied 444 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations. Before induction of anesthesia, 119 patients who chronically took calcium entry blocking drugs received nifedipine 20 mg or diltiazem 60 mg orally, 74 received calcium entry and beta adrenergic blocking drugs, 71 received beta blocking drugs only, and 180 received neither. New ischemia occurred in 208 (46.8%) patients; 55 at arrival to the operating room, 86 only after induction, and 67 separately during both periods. Two-thirds of all ischemia was not related to extremes of heart rate or blood pressure; this type was not less frequent in patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs. Ischemia did occur less frequently in the two patient groups receiving beta adrenergic blocking drugs (34% vs. 53%), a result of less tachycardia both on arrival (3.4% vs. 15.4%) and during anesthesia, when peak heart rate exceeded 109 bpm in only one of 145 beta-blocked patients compared to 29 of 299 not receiving beta blocking drugs. While ischemia appeared during anesthesia in 34.5% of all patients, its incidence was doubled (63%) when heart rate was greater than or equal to 110 bpm. At lower heart rates, the incidence of ischemia did not differ among groups. With respect to all types of ischemia, patients receiving calcium entry blocking drugs only were indistinguishable from those receiving no antianginal therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies investigating the incidence of myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery have not considered the potential significance of the preoperative ischemic pattern in the development of intra- and postoperative myocardial ischemia and infarction. Accordingly, the authors compared the frequency and severity of pre-, intra-, and postoperative ischemic episodes (ST-segment depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV or elevation greater than or equal to 0.2 mV) in 50 men with severe coronary artery disease scheduled for elective CABG. All subjects were monitored by continuous electrocardiography (ECG) (Holter monitor) for 2 preoperative days, intraoperatively, and 2 postoperative days (total monitoring time = 4,363 h). Routine anti-anginal medications were continued until the morning of surgery, and the anesthetic management of the patient was not controlled. During the preoperative period, 42% of the patients had ECG ischemic episodes, 87% of which were clinically silent. Only 18% developed intraoperative ischemia. Postoperatively, the incidence increased to 40%. The number of ischemic episodes/hour (epis/h) of monitoring among the three monitoring periods was similar (0.09 +/- 0.12 epis/h preoperatively, 0.11 +/- 0.20 epis/h intraoperatively, and 0.05 +/- 0.08 epis/h postoperatively; P = NS). The median duration of ischemic episodes was similar pre- and intraoperatively (16 vs. 18.5 min, P = NS), but greater postoperatively (41 min, P less than 0.05). Seventy-six per cent of the perioperative ECG ischemia occurred without acute change (+/- 20% of control) in blood pressure or heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Non-randomized, controlled, short-term (9 months) trial and long-term (22 months) exercise training and detraining (13 months). SETTING: Section of applied physiology at a university school of medicine. PATIENTS: Thirty-five healthy, sedentary postmenopausal women, 55 to 70 years old. All women completed the study. There was 90% compliance with exercise training. INTERVENTIONS: All women were given calcium, 1500 mg daily. The exercise group did weight-bearing exercise (walking, jogging, stair climbing) at 70% to 90% of maximal oxygen uptake capacity for 50 to 60 min, 3 times weekly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bone mineral content increased 5.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0% to 8.4%; P = 0.0037) above baseline after short-term training whereas there was no change (-1.4%) in the control group. After 22 months of exercise, bone mineral content was 6.1% (95% CI, 3.9% to 8.3% above baseline; P = 0.0001) in the long-term training group. After 13 months of decreased activity, bone mass was 1.1% above baseline in the detraining group. CONCLUSIONS: Weight-bearing exercise led to significant increases above baseline in bone mineral content which were maintained with continued training in older, postmenopausal women. With reduced weight-bearing exercise, bone mass reverted to baseline levels. Further studies are needed to determine the threshold exercise prescription that will produce significant increases in bone mass.\r"

In the present study, the cardiovascular effects of centrally administered CGRP were examined in conscious, normotensive rats. The rats were chronically instrumented with miniaturized pulsed Doppler flow probes to allow measurement of regional blood flow in the conscious animals. Injection of increasing doses of CGRP (0.3 to 3.0 micrograms/kg) in the lateral cerebroventricles transiently increased arterial pressure (maximal change = 13 +/- 3 mm Hg) and markedly increased heart rate (maximal increase = 88 +/- 10 b/min). The heart rate response was sustained over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. Central CGRP decreased hindquarter vascular resistance but had no effect on renal or mesenteric vascular resistances. In contrast, intravenous injections of CGRP reduced arterial pressure and renal, mesenteric, and hindquarter vascular resistances. The tachycardia response to central CGRP was attenuated by pretreatment with propranolol or hexamethonium, indicating that the heart rate response was mediated, in part, through increases in cardiac sympathetic tone. These data indicate that central CGRP may alter cardiovascular function through alterations in sympathetic outflow.\r"

Varying concentrations of aplastic canine serum served as the source of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity, and cultured megakaryocyte ploidy distributions were determined by Feulgen staining and microfluorometry. Megakaryocyte colony growth was strikingly abnormal in all five patients evaluated. Four of the 5 had a marked expansion in the concentration of circulating CFU-Meg and 3 of 4 manifested abnormalities in cultured megakaryocyte colony size (2 unusually large and 1 small). Unstimulated megakaryocyte colony growth was substantially increased in three patients. However, the fraction of megakaryocyte progenitors in cell cycle was near or below normal in all instances. Endomitotic megakaryocyte development was disordered in each of the four ET patients in whom it was evaluable. In normal subjects, mean megakaryocyte ploidy values vary biphasically with aplastic canine serum concentration and peak at 13.2 N following 12 to 15 days of culture. In contrast, day 12 mean ploidy values in cultures from the ET patients remained low at all aplastic canine serum concentrations and reached a maximum averaging only 8.4 N. Three patients were evaluated serially at extended culture durations of up to 21 days. The cultured megakaryocyte ploidy was unchanged during this interval for two of the patients. For the third patient, ploidy increased steadily, reaching abnormally high ploidy values by day 21. Progenitor cell expansion was limited to the megakaryocyte line in three patients. However, two patients had substantial increases in CFU-GM, one of whom also had a marked increase in BFU-E. There was no significant unstimulated colony growth by either CFU-GM or BFU-E. These data indicate that ET is usually characterized by an expansion in the concentration of circulating CFU-Meg in vivo which manifest both disordered replication and endoreduplication in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated helper and suppressor functions to B-cell responses and T-T cell interactions of purified T4 and T8 cells from 20 untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Appropriate mixtures of purified T4 or T8 cells from patients with CLL were cultured with purified B cells or T4 and B cells from normal donors for 7 days with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IgM, IgA, and IgG produced were determined in the supernatants of these cultures by a heavy chain-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared to those obtained by the corresponding mixtures of T4, T8, and B cells from normal donors. Purified T4 cells from 14 of 20 patients with CLL exhibited defective helper function (P less than .001) to immunoglobulin (Ig) production by purified B cells from normal donors. Purified T4 cells from 6 of these 14 patients were able to suppress significantly (P less than .001) and in a concentration-dependent manner Ig production by mixtures of T4 and B cells from normal donors, in the absence of T8 cells. These suppressor effector T4 cells from certain patients were partially radiosensitive. Purified T8 cells from 8 of 20 patients with CLL exhibited excessive suppressor activity. These cells significantly suppressed (P less than .001), Ig production by mixtures of T4 and B cells from normal donors to a degree significantly higher (P less than .005) than that observed by equal numbers of T8 cells from normal donors. This inhibition was dependent on the numbers of the T8 CLL cells added to the cultures. Excessive suppressor activity by T8 CLL cells was at least in part radiosensitive in four of eight patients. These results demonstrate a wide range of immunoregulatory T-cell abnormalities in patients with CLL. Naturally occurring T4 suppressor effector cells, directly inhibiting Ig production by mixtures of T4 and B cells, in the absence of T8 cells, are present in certain patients with CLL.\r"

  ".U": "88222394\r", 
  ".W": "The 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides (ddNs) are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected individuals. When phosphorylated, the ddNs (ddNTPs) function as chain-terminating substrate analogues with reverse transcriptase, thereby inhibiting HIV replication. These nucleoside analogues can also inhibit, by chain-terminating additions, the primitive lymphoid DNA polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). To determine the effect of possible intracellular chain-terminating additions of ddNMPs by TdT, we exposed a series of TdT-positive and TdT-negative cell lines to 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA), a representative ddN. At ddA concentrations 25-fold higher than required for inhibition of HIV replication, progressive dose-related cytotoxicity was observed in the TdT-positive cell lines. This was accentuated by the adenosine deaminase inhibitor Coformycin (CF), presumably by enhancing the intracellular generation of ddATP from ddA. A central role of TdT in mediating the ddA/CF cytotoxicity was suggested by studies in a pre-B-cell line rendered TdT positive by infection with a TdT cDNA-containing retroviral vector. After a 48-hour continuous exposure period to 250 mumol/L ddA and 30 mumol/L CF, 30% cell death was observed in the TdT-negative parental line, whereas 90% cell death was observed in the TdT-positive daughter line. Exposure of fresh TdT-positive leukemic cells to ddA/CF for 72 hours ex vivo resulted in cytotoxicity (six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL]) while not affecting TdT-negative acute leukemic cells (six cases). We conclude that ddA/CF selectively damages TdT-positive cells, presumably by chain-terminating additions of ddAMP, and that this may have therapeutic relevance in TdT-positive malignant disease.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, human multi-CSF was obtained by molecular cloning. In the present study, the effects of multi-CSF in vitro were investigated by comparative culture of whole bone marrow or progenitor cells obtained by sorting the cell fraction that binds the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) B13C5 (CD 34). Multi-CSF stimulated erythroid (BFU-E), multipotential (CFU-GEMM) and eosinophil (CFU-Eo) colonies in cultures of the progenitor cell enriched fraction, whereas (besides BFU-E, CFU-GEMM, and CFU-Eo) granulocyte (CFU-G), granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), and macrophage (CFU-M) colony-forming cells also were stimulated by multi-CSF when unfractionated bone marrow was cultured. Reconstitution of the progenitor cell fraction (B13C5 positive) with the B13C5-negative population restored the broad spectrum of progenitor cell stimulation. This suggested that accessory cells are required for expression of the full spectrum of progenitor cell stimulation by multi-CSF. Subsequently, specific marrow cell populations, including T lymphocytes, granulocytic cells, and monocytes, were prepared by using selected MoAbs in complement-mediated lysis or cell sorting, added to cultures of hematopoietic progenitors and tested for accessory cell function. The results demonstrate that small numbers of monocytes permit the stimulation of CFU-G, CFU-GM, and CFU-M by multi-CSF. These monocyte-dependent stimulating effects on CFU-G, CFU-GM, and CFU-M could also be achieved by adding recombinant GM-CSF as a substitute for monocytes to the cultures. Therefore, multi-CSF most likely has direct stimulative effects on BFU-E, CFU-GEMM, and CFU-Eo and indirect effects on CFU-G, CFU-GM, and CFU-M in the presence of monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Patients who receive desmopressin acetate (dDAVP) after cardiopulmonary bypass bleed less during operation and in the first 24 hours after operation than do patients who receive a placebo. To study the mechanism of improved hemostasis in bypass patients, we examined the relationship between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and blood loss in 70 cardiopulmonary bypass patients, one-half of whom received desmopressin intraoperatively. vWF concentration and multimeric composition were analyzed before and after bypass, after drug treatment, and 24 hours after operation. Before operation, patients with valvular disease had lower percentages of vWF high-mol-wt multimers (HMWMs) than did healthy subjects or patients with coronary artery disease, but subsequent blood loss, vWF activity, and bleeding times were not related to this finding. Irrespective of drug treatment, patients who had low preoperative vWF and who had a net loss of the protein during bypass bled more after bypass than did similar patients who had a net increase of vWF during bypass. HMWMs rose to above normal levels after bypass regardless of desmopressin infusion. Differences in the concentration of vWF between desmopressin and placebo patients after receipt of the drug, although small, were better correlated with reduced blood loss than were differences in HMWM distribution. We conclude that the beneficial effect of desmopressin on hemostasis following cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be attributed to a drug-induced change in HMWM distribution but may be related to an increase in overall vWF concentration.\r"

During a 12-hour incubation with 10(-6) mol/L dCF and 10(-4) mol/L deoxyadenosine, tumor cells sequentially accumulated dATP, became depleted of NAD followed by ATP, then died. More than 5 logs of 6C3HED cells were killed as measured by survival of mice injected with treated tumor cells. Identical incubation of 5 x 10(6) marrow cells did not interfere with rescue of syngeneic lethally irradiated mice. Long-term survival was demonstrated in 12 of 14 mice that received marrow that had been contaminated with 5% 6C3HED cells, incubated with deoxycoformycin and deoxyadenosine, then used to rescue lethally irradiated mice. This murine model provides information not available from in vitro assays and may be useful in the development of strategies to purge malignant T cells from marrow.\r"

Both cell types reacted with an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity and a decrease in the plasminogen activator (PA) activity in the media after incubation under anoxic conditions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fibrin autography and reverse fibrin autography indicated that the change in fibrinolytic potential was due to an impaired release of PA and not an increase in the production of PAI. Although anoxia did not affect the viability of the cells as judged by 51Cr release, their metabolism was influenced, which is reflected by increases in the levels of lactate in cell lysates and media. Furthermore, the effect of short-term anoxia on PA and PAI could not be reversed by reoxygenation for 24 hours. The results are discussed in terms of helping to explain the tendency of reocclusion after successful thrombolytic therapy, the development of pulmonary hypertension, and the thrombotic tendency of areas with an impaired circulatory supply.\r"

  ".U": "88222419\r", 
  ".W": "Currently available evidence suggests that in the steady state, the majority of hematopoietic stem cells are dormant in cell cycle and reside in the so-called G0 period. Studies in our laboratory indicated that once a stem cell leaves G0, its subsequent proliferation requires the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). Recently it was reported that interleukin-1 (IL-1) may stimulate stem cells to become sensitive to IL-3. In a separate study, we observed that interleukin-6 (IL-6, also known as B cell stimulatory factor-2/interferon beta 2) possesses synergism with IL-3, shortening the G0 period of murine hematopoietic stem cells. We report here that human IL-6 and IL-3 act synergistically in support of the proliferation of progenitors for human blast cell colonies and that IL-1 alpha reveals no synergism with IL-3 when tested against purified human marrow progenitors. Panned My-10+ human marrow cells were plated in culture and on day 14 of incubation, either IL-3, IL-6, IL-1 alpha or a combination of these factors was added to the cultures. Blast cell colony formation was analyzed daily between days 18 and 32 of culture. IL-6 or IL-1 alpha alone failed to support blast cell colony formation. In the presence of IL-3 alone, blast cell colonies continued to emerge between days 21 and 27. When a combination of IL-3 and IL-6 was added, blast cell colonies developed earlier than in cultures with IL-3 alone and twice as many blast cell colonies were identified. IL-1 alpha failed to augment IL-3-dependent blast cell colony formation. Replating studies of the individual blast cell colonies revealed various types of single as well as multilineage colonies. These observations suggest that IL-6 shortens the G0 period of human hematopoietic stem cells and that the reported synergistic activities of IL-1 on primitive hematopoietic cells may be indirect.\r"

There were statistically significant differences in all tests (except C3) between patients and normal controls. Marked differences were seen in the lymphocyte count, ERFT, and 29 degrees C ERFT after radiotherapy (p less than 0.01). The diameters of induration of the PHA skin tests were less than those before radiotherapy (p less than 0.01). There were higher incidences of recurrence and metastases in the patients with high levels of CIC and low numbers of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood after radiotherapy. Cellular immunity remained at a low level 8 months after radiotherapy.\r"

We tested peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PMBC) for spontaneous blastogenic transformation (SBT), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsiveness. Plasma samples were also assayed for inhibition of mitogen stimulation of control PMBCs. Mean values were calculated for the acute postburn period (days 0-3) and the following 4 days, before the development of septic complications. SBT was significantly increased in all patients during the second period of investigation (days 4-7) in comparison to normal controls and during the acute phase. The response to mitogen stimulation (PHA) was significantly suppressed during days 0-7 and the plasma samples showed high suppressive activities following PHA stimulation of control lymphocytes during the course of the study. No significant differences in rates of SBT, PHA responsiveness and plasma suppressive activity were found between those patients who developed bacteraemia and those with negative blood cultures. The latter group showed higher reactivity to added IL-2 in comparison to normal controls. Surgical treatment immediately after trauma (fasciotomy; day 0 or 1) resulted in further increased immunosuppression (PHA and IL-2 response), whereas after necrectomy (days 4-7) the immunological parameters showed no significant differences. It can be concluded that neither rates of SBT nor response to PHA can be used to identify patients at high risk for infection during the first week postburn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We therefore measured serum Lp(a) levels in 167 symptomatic patients undergoing cardiac catheterization who had had coronary artery bypass surgery 0.7 to 14.3 years earlier. Lp(a), total cholesterol, and total triglyceride levels were compared with the degree of saphenous vein graft stenosis to test for any association. Serum Lp(a) levels were significantly associated with the degree of stenosis of saphenous vein grafts (r = .24, p = .002). Mean Lp(a) levels (mg/dl) in the 135 patients with stenosis were almost double (32.0 +/- 32.7, mean +/- SD) those in the 32 patients with no graft stenosis (16.7 +/- 22.6; p = .002). Graft stenosis was not associated with previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, or smoking. Serum cholesterol levels (mg/dl) were slightly higher in the stenosis group (251.3 +/- 69) than in the no-stenosis group (231.8 +/- 48.8), but the difference was of borderline significance (p = .06). A stepwise increase in mean Lp(a) was found in groups of patients with increasing vein graft stenosis. At a serum Lp(a) level of 31.6 mg/dl or above, 92% of the patients demonstrated vein graft stenosis. Thus, patients with elevated Lp(a) levels have an increased risk of developing saphenous vein graft stenosis after coronary bypass surgery.\r"

Stanozolol had variable effects on the expression of two other markers of the osteoblast phenotype, namely the bone-specific vitamin-K-dependent protein osteocalcin, and the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Although stanozolol tended to increase the values, this was not seen in all experiments. 4. We conclude that human bone cells respond to stanozolol.

Prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha and 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 did not stimulate fibrinogen synthesis and fibrinogen polypeptide mRNA content when administered intraperitoneally to rats or when added to monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes. 3. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors did not abolish the stimulation of fibrinogen synthesis and its mRNA content induced by monocytic products in vivo or in vitro. 4. These findings indicate that the enhanced synthesis of fibrinogen induced by monocytic products (including IL-1) during the acute-phase response is not mediated by prostaglandins or other products of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid.\r"

Leukocyte count is significantly (and inversely) correlated with VLF in nonsmokers as well as in smokers. A multiple regression analysis indicated that, after accounting for the effect of height and age, white blood cell (WBC) count explains more of the VLF variance than many other health determinants. Moreover, WBC count is the only variable, apart from height and age, that contributes significantly to the regression. Current smokers with elevated leukocyte count in peripheral blood may constitute a defined high-risk group because they demonstrate more negative regression age coefficients when compared with smokers without elevated WBC or with nonsmokers. Mechanisms that may explain these findings are discussed.\r"

We studied 20 patients with previous coronary artery bypass surgery in order to determine whether this operation results in some degree of pericardial constriction which could be demonstrated by rapid volume expansion. After infusing 1 L of physiologic saline solution over six minutes, the right atrial pressure increased by 5 +/- 2 mm Hg, the right ventricular diastolic pressure by 4 +/- 3 mm Hg, the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 7 +/- 3 mm Hg, and the left ventricular diastolic pressure by 7 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). Equalization of the left and right cardiac pressures was not observed, and the normal respiratory variation of the pressures was not altered by rapid volume expansion. Thus, the pericardial manipulation associated with the performance of coronary artery bypass surgery does not commonly result in the development of subclinical pericardial constriction.\r"

Virus isolation and serologic studies proved eight cases were A/Philippine/2/82 (H1N2) and four cases were B/USSR/100/83. Four cases of A/Philippine/2/82 and two cases of B/USSR/100/83 were isolated from six control subjects who had suffered from influenza infection without asthma attack. The absolute lymphocyte count, T cell subsets increased in influenza patients both with and without asthma attack. However, the OKT4/OKT8 ratio markedly decreased in the influenza with asthma group during the acute phase. Since the fresh asthmatic patients had decreased OKT4/OKT8 ratio and increased lympho-proliferative response, IL-2 production increased after their lymphocytes were stimulated with housedust antigen and returned to near normal after hyposensitization therapy. Therefore, these results suggest that influenza virus has asthmagenicity and may contribute to precipitating an asthma attack.\r"

PTH caused time- and concentration-dependent decreases in Na+-dependent phosphate transport, with 10 pM PTH-(1-34) producing a 19% decline in phosphate transport. The EC50 for PTH inhibition of phosphate transport was 50 pM. Kinetic analyses of phosphate transport indicated that PTH decreased the maximum velocity without affecting the Km for phosphate. PTH increased cAMP formation with an EC50 of 10 nM. 8-Bromo-cAMP and (Bu)2cAMP also inhibited phosphate transport. Forskolin increased cAMP formation and decreased phosphate transport, whereas the cyclase-inactive forskolin analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin also inhibited phosphate transport. The PTH analog [8,18-norleucine,34-tyrosinamide]PTH-(3-34) reduced phosphate transport at concentrations from 10 nM to 30 microM, but did not increase cAMP formation at concentrations up to 10 microM. The adenylate cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine produced concentration-dependent decreases in PTH-stimulated cAMP formation, but did not influence PTH inhibition of Na+-dependent phosphate transport. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and prostaglandin E1 increased cAMP formation in OK cells, but were weak inhibitors of phosphate transport. This study suggests that cAMP may not be the only transmembrane signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of Na+-dependent phosphate transport by PTH-(1-34) in OK cells.\r"

These studies were undertaken to assess the possible relationship between steroidogenesis and IL-1 activity elaborated by human peripheral monocytes. IL-1 was measured with the D-10 thymocyte stimulation bioassay and dose response curves as a function of both estradiol (E2) and P were established. Low concentrations of both E2 (10(-9) M-10(-10) M) and P (10(-8) M-10(-9) M) resulted in maximal IL-1 stimulation. At higher concentrations of both E2 (10(-7) M) and P (10(-7) M-10(-5) M) there was a significant reduction (P less than 0.05) in IL-1 activity. However, neither E2 nor P production by human granulosa-luteal cells cultured with increasing amounts of human IL-1 (0 to 20 IU/ml) was affected in either the absence or presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 5 IU/ml). Thus, human peripheral monocyte IL-1 activity appears to be modulated by gonadal steroids; however, a reciprocal relationship between IL-1 and gonadal steroidogenesis was not observed.\r"

The indirect immunofluorescent antibody test was used. Ten of 86 (11.6%) sera and 3 of 14 (21.4%) ascites from hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positive bindings, whereas only 1 of 35 (2.8%) sera, none of 4 (0%) ascites from chronic hepatitis patients and 3 of 60 (5%) normal human sera had positive immunofluorescent antibody activity. The binding specificities of these positive specimens were further defined by other human cancer cell lines and mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. The antinuclear antibody test against mouse liver sections was also performed. The results suggested that antigens identified by the two tests may not be identical. The nature of nuclear antigens reactive with one of the serum samples, S83, and ascites A83 were characterized. These antigens were sensitive to trypsin but not to RNase A and DNase I. Further studies by radioimmunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with serum S83 and ascites A83 showed two acidic phosphorylated antigens with molecular weights of 77 and 79 kd, which had a pI around pH 5.2. The presence of a large amount of these two phosphorylated proteins in 5 of 7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines suggests that these two antigens might play some roles in the carcinogenesis or progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

Despite large individual variabilities, significant increases of these molecules were detected at t 20 min, particularly with CU device in the artery and more marked in the vein except for C3d with PAN. During the later stage of HD, while C3a and C5a levels gradually declined, but remained significantly higher than t 0 in all the patients treated with CU, the C3d concentration reached a plateau suggesting a continuous complement activation throughout HD. HD using PAN membranes were associated with a lower C3a, C3d and C5a generation and fewer dialyses generating these products. In some dialyses the higher arterial level of these molecules suggests an extra-dialyzer complement activation especially with PAN membrane. Although C5a venous levels appeared to be the more significant index of complement activation, for clinical purposes we propose the C3d arterial measurement as a reliable, non-expensive and technically simple indicator of membrane intolerance.\r"

This study was performed to elucidate the role of endogenous VP in potentiating CRH-induced ACTH secretion in man. Synthetic human CRH (100 micrograms) was injected iv into seven normal men after they had been water loaded (20 mL/kg; 60 and 30 min before CRH injection; WL-CRH test) and water deprived (water restriction for 18 h before CRH injection; WD-CRH test). Blood samples were obtained before and 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after CRH injection at 0900 h for determination of plasma ACTH, cortisol, arginine vasopressin (AVP), CRH, and catecholamine levels and osmolality. Urine was obtained immediately before and 120 min after CRH injection for determination of osmolality. The mean plasma AVP levels were significantly higher during the WD-CRH test [1.8 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) to 1.9 +/- 0.4 pmol/L] than during the WL-CRH test (0.6 +/- 0.1 to 0.9 +/- 0.1 pmol/L). The mean plasma ACTH and cortisol levels rose significantly from basal (4.5 +/- 0.6 pmol/L and 320 +/- 20 nmol/L, respectively) to peak values of 14.0 +/- 2.1 pmol/L at 30 min and 700 +/- 50 nmol/L at 60 min, respectively, during the WD-CRH test. During the WL-CRH test, mean basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were 3.5 +/- 0.7 pmol/L and 420 +/- 50 nmol/L, respectively, and reached peak values of 7.7 +/- 1.1 pmol/L at 60 min and 550 +/- 40 nmol/L at 30 min, respectively. Both the mean peak levels and integrated ACTH and cortisol responses were significantly higher during the WD-CRH than during the WL-CRH test. There was no significant difference between the plasma CRH and catecholamine concentrations in both tests. These results suggest that endogenous AVP potentiates CRH-stimulated ACTH secretion and, thus, plays a physiologically significant role in regulating CRH-stimulated ACTH and cortisol secretion in man.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of human thyroid cells in culture (mostly from pathological tissues) failed to demonstrate a mitogenic effect of TSH, leading to the proposal that the growth effect of TSH in vivo might be indirect. To reexamine the influence of TSH on DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, we established primary cultures of normal thyroid tissue from nine subjects. When seeded in a 1% serum-supplemented medium, thyroid follicles released by collagenase/dispase digestion developed as a cell monolayer that responded to TSH by rounding up and by cytoplasmic retraction. When seeded in serum-free medium, the cells remained associated in dense aggregates surrounded by few slowly spreading cells. In the latter condition, the cells responded to TSH and other stimulators of cAMP production, such as cholera toxin and forskolin, by displaying very high iodide-trapping levels. Exposure to serum irreversibly abolished this differentiated function. TSH stimulated the proliferation (as shown by DNA content per culture dish) of 1% serum cultured cells (doubling times were reduced from 106 to 76 h) and increased by 100% the [3H]thymidine labeling indices. In serum-free cultured cells (dense aggregates or cell monolayers after initial seeding with serum), control levels of DNA synthesis were lower, and up to 8-fold stimulation of DNA synthesis occurred in response to 100 mU/L TSH (stimulation was consistently detected with 20 mU/L), based on measurements of [3H]thymidine incorporation into acid-precipitable material and counts of labeled nuclei on autoradiographs (up to 40% labeled nuclei within 24 h). The mitogenic effect of TSH required a high insulin concentration (8.3 X 10(-7) mol/L) or a low insulin-like growth factor I concentration. The mitogenic effects of TSH were mimicked in part by cholera toxin, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP. Epidermal growth factor and phorbol myristate ester also stimulated thyroid cell proliferation and DNA synthesis, but they potently inhibited TSH-stimulated iodide transport. We conclude that TSH, acting at least in part through cAMP, is a potent growth factor for human thyroid cells and thus provide an experimental basis in vitro for the well established in vivo goitrogenic action of TSH.\r"

To determine if SPECT imaging of the thyroid augments information provided by planar imaging, both SPECT and pinhole planar scans were performed in 52 patients with thyroid disease. After 123I (n = 45), Tc99m (n = 5), or thallium-201 (n = 2) administration, images were acquired at 30 intervals along a 180 degree arc. Nodules that were hypofunctioning on planar scans (n = 4) were equally well shown on SPECT images. SPECT analysis of 123I uptake by 5 palpable nodules with completely normal 123I planar scans demonstrated the nodular tracer uptake was increased (n = 1), equivalent (n = 3), or decreased (n = 1) in comparison with that of extranodular tissue. In 6 of 12 multinodular goiters, transaxial SPECT images showed tracheal compression, which was confirmed by neck x-ray, flow volume loops, or surgery. A neck phantom study was performed to assess the accuracy of SPECT-determined functional thyroid volume. SPECT-estimated volumes (30-173 mL; n = 11) correlated well with true volumes (r = 0.996; P less than 0.001). Our observations suggest that SPECT is a useful adjunct to planar imaging in 1) estimating functional volume for 131I dosimetry; 2) evaluating the size, extension, and tracheal compression of multinodular goiter; and 3) determining the functional properties of palpable nodules with normal 123I planar pinhole images.\r"

A double-staining method with Lag and anti-T6 antibody revealed that Lag reacted to 70% of T6-positive cells in the lymph nodes but to almost all such cells in skin lesions of patients with Letterer-Siwe disease, suggesting that the proliferating cells consist of at least Lag+, T6+, and Lag-, T6+ subpopulations.\r"

In this article we describe three patients in whom the recognition of certain clinical and histologic features of panniculitis eventually led to the diagnosis of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Two of our patients were young adults and one was a child. All three had draining, panniculitis, or cellulitis-like lesions at sites of prior trauma. The histopathologic findings were characterized by liquefactive dermal necrosis and collagenolysis of the fibrous septa of the subcutis. The combination of these clinical and microscopic findings should suggest the diagnosis of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis. The suspicion can be verified by obtaining quantitative serum levels and enzyme phenotyping. The identification of the alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency state as the cause of a distinct type of panniculitis adds additional evidence for the elimination of the term Weber-Christian disease.\r"

Using cell-size artificial membranes (pseudocytes) bearing H-2 class I Ag it is demonstrated that T cells can, in addition, recognize nonpolymorphic determinants on class I proteins. Pseudocytes bearing class I alloantigen stimulate in vitro generation of secondary allogeneic CTL responses. At a suboptimal alloantigen surface density, incorporation of class I molecules identical to those of the responder cells (self-H-2) or from third-party cells resulted in dramatically enhanced responses, whereas incorporation of class II proteins had no effect. The receptor that mediates recognition of conserved class I determinants has not been identified, but results of antibody blocking studies are consistent with the Lyt-2/3 complex of CTL having this role. Thus, class I proteins on Ag-bearing cells can have two distinct roles in T cell activation, one involving recognition of polymorphic determinants by the Ag-specific receptor and the other involving recognition of conserved determinants.\r"

Specifically, it has been shown in many target cell systems that the expression of class I MHC proteins by target cells is inversely proportional to their susceptibility to lysis by NK cells. It has been suggested, therefore, that MHC proteins may act as important negative regulatory elements in the ongoing control of NK cell function. Herein, we examined two closely related murine lymphoma cells (ASL1 and ASL1w), both in terms of their susceptibility to lysis by NK cells as well as their expression of both H-2K and H-2D class I MHC proteins. The results of these studies showed that whereas ASL1 and ASL1w cells differed greatly in their susceptibility to NK cell lysis (ASL1 was much more NK resistant than ASL1w), both expressed high levels of H-2K and D proteins. In contrast to what might have been predicted base on reports from other target cell systems, the more NK susceptible ASL1w cells expressed somewhat higher levels of H-2K Ag than did ASL1 cells. These results indicate that expression of H-2 class I proteins by target cells, in and of itself, is not sufficient to inhibit the lytic activity of murine NK cells.\r"

  ".U": "88229057\r", 
  ".W": "Anti-IgM irreversibly inhibits the growth of WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells and induces phosphoinositide hydrolysis--producing diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which induces the release of calcium from intracellular storage sites into the cytoplasm, and other inositol polyphosphates. The roles of two of the possible second messengers, cytoplasmic free calcium and diacylglycerol, in mediating the action of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 cells were assessed by elevating [Ca2+]i with ionomycin and by activating protein kinase C with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PdBu). The combination of 250 nM ionomycin and 4 to 7 nM PdBu was found to cause growth arrest and cell volume decrease responses in WEHI-231 cells which were similar to those caused by anti-IgM, although clearly slower. Both anti-IgM and the combination of mimicking reagents induced growth arrest of WEHI-231 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In both cases, this growth arrest was mitigated by addition of bacterial LPS. Moreover, 250 nM ionomycin plus 4 to 7 nM PdBu did not inhibit the growth of two other murine B lymphoma cell lines, each of which did exhibit increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis but not growth arrest in response to anti-Ig. Taken together, these results suggest that ionomycin and PdBu, at the concentrations used, did not inhibit WEHI-231 growth by general toxicity, but rather by mimicking the effects of the natural second messengers generated from Ag receptor cross-linking. Thus, the phosphoinositide-derived second messengers Ca2+i and diacylglycerol are capable of playing important roles in mediating the action of anti-IgM on WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells. However, the response of WEHI-231 cells to anti-IgM could not be fully reproduced with ionomycin and phorbol diester. These results suggest that another second messenger induced by anti-IgM may also play an important role in mediating the growth arrest of these cells.\r"

To define surface components of activation pathways important in the function of these cells, we have generated mAb against a rheumatoid synovial T cell line. One such antibody, termed anti-UM4D4, reacts with an Ag, termed UM4D4, which is strongly expressed on most rheumatoid synovial T cell lines and clones, and on a subset of peripheral blood T cells, resting or activated. Anti-UM4D4 is mitogenic in soluble form for PBMC and certain T cell clones, and is comitogenic with the phorbol ester PMA for purified resting T lymphocytes. These functional effects are similar to those previously observed with antibodies to epitopes of CD2 and CD3, surface Ag involved in two well defined pathways of human T cell activation. Binding of anti-UM4D4 to T cells is not, however, blocked by antibodies directed at various epitopes of CD2 and CD3. Moreover, UM4D4 does not comodulate with CD3, and is expressed on a T cell line that lacks CD2, CD3, and CD28. The data, therefore, indicate that anti-UM4D4 identifies a T cell activation pathway, distinct from those previously described, that could play a role in the pathogenesis of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.\r"

The role of B cells in T cell priming in vivo was examined by adoptively transferring hapten-specific B cells into anti-mu mice, followed by immunization with haptenated Ag in CFA. The T cell proliferative response to OVA of anti-mu BALB/c mice was partially restored by the administration of TNP or FITC-specific B cells and immunization with TNP-OVA or FITC-OVA, respectively. This reconstitution was Ag-specific, inasmuch as hapten-binding B cells restored the T cell responses to OVA in mice immunized with the same hapten coupled to OVA. The mechanism of B cell reconstitution of T cell priming in anti-mu mice was addressed using parental to F1 B cell transfers. The Ia restriction pattern of the activated T cells from these mice indicated that both direct presentation of Ag by transferred B cells and antibody-mediated enhancement of Ag presentation by non-B, host Ag-presenting cells occurred. Thus, Ag-specific B lymphocytes play a critical role in priming of T cells in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Nonobese diabetic (NOD) is an inbred mouse strain susceptible to development of T cell-mediated autoimmune diabetes. The strain is characterized by high percentages of T lymphocytes in lymphoid organs. The syngeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (SMLR), a T cell response to self MHC class II Ag, is reportedly involved in the generation of a number of immunoregulatory cells, including suppressor inducers. A severely depressed SMLR characteristic of certain other autoimmune strains was found in NOD but not in nonautoimmune SWR/Bm mice. Moreover, IL-2 produced by NOD T cells at day 6 in an SMLR was at least one hundredfold reduced compared with SWR, and NOD T cells harvested from an SMLR at day 6 were functionally defective when tested for ability to induce suppression of an allogeneic MLR. However, functionally competent suppressor T cells were generated in NOD splenic leukocyte cultures in response to Con A, and IL-2 release from these was equivalent to that released by Con A-stimulated SWR splenocytes. A deficiency in cytokine release was not limited to IL-2, because peritoneal exudate cells from NOD exhibited a greatly diminished sensitivity to LPS-stimulated IL-1 release in comparison to SWR mice. IL-2 supplementation both in vitro and in vivo restored the ability of NOD T cells to respond in a SMLR, with production of cells capable of inducing suppression. Like SMLR-activated T cells from untreated SWR controls, SMLR blasts from IL-2-treated NOD mice were enriched for the L3T4 phenotype. IL-1 supplementation in vitro resulted in partial restoration of T suppressor activation in a SMLR. The depressed SMLR exhibited by NOD mice was apparently a stimulator cell dysfunction, because NOD stimulator cells failed to activate T cells from (SWR x NOD)F1 mice, whereas stimulators from SWR or F1 mice were capable of doing so. Collectively, these results suggest a defect in suppressor cell activation rather than an absence of this immunoregulatory cell population.\r"

This inactivation was dependent on both incubation time and enzyme concentration. IL-1 beta was protected by the presence in the incubation medium of phosphoramidon, a specific inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11. After incubation of IL-1-rich supernatant with the enzyme, the thymocyte proliferation activity could be restored by adding purified IL-1 beta to the samples, indicating that neither the enzyme nor the buffer had any toxic effect on thymocyte proliferation. In the same experimental conditions, IL-2 activity was not destroyed by endopeptidase 24.11.\r"

Using overlapping peptide fragments expressed in yeast and bacteria, we have mapped the regions of the protein to which these antibodies bind. To assess the relevance of the different regions of IL-1 beta for the expression of its biologic activity, the ability of the antibodies to block IL-1 activity was assayed. Antibodies recognizing the regions 133-148 and 251-269 of human IL-1 beta could inhibit the activity of IL-1 beta, but not of IL-1 alpha, in two different biologic assays, the murine thymocyte proliferation and PGE2 release from human fibroblasts. Conversely, antibodies that recognize the region 218-243 have only a moderate inhibitory effect on the IL-1 beta biologic activity in both assays. Finally, an antibody mapping to the region 148-192 did not inhibit IL-1 beta activity either on thymocytes or on fibroblasts. It is suggested that IL-1 beta-induced cell activation involves different regions of the protein and that both N-terminal and C-terminal fragments are involved in the correct functioning of the IL-1 beta molecule.\r"

To evaluate the possible mechanisms underlying the observation that mature populations of human mononuclear phagocytes as alveolar macrophages are relatively poor IL-1 producers compared with blood monocytes, the expression of the IL-1 beta gene mRNA transcripts was evaluated in LPS-stimulated normal autologous blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages by using a IL-1 beta cDNA probe. Although Northern analysis demonstrated that stimulated monocytes and alveolar macrophages both express 1.8-kb IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts, cytoplasmic dot blot analysis showed that the total IL-1 beta mRNA content in alveolar macrophages was only 38 +/- 5% of that in blood monocytes. In situ hybridization with antisense and sense IL-1 beta RNA probes demonstrated that whereas most of stimulated blood monocytes contained IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts, a significant proportion of autologous alveolar macrophages stimulated in an identical fashion did not express the IL-1 beta gene. Within 4 h after LPS stimulation, IL-1 beta mRNA transcripts were detected in 81 +/- 6% monocytes, whereas only 16 +/- 9% of alveolar macrophages were positive, and by 18 h this had increased only to 43 +/- 15%. Quantification of the size distribution of the IL-1 beta mRNA expressing mononuclear phagocytes demonstrated that, among the population of alveolar macrophages, the cells expressing this gene were not confined to those that were \"monocyte-like.\" These observations demonstrate that there is a heterogeneity among population of mononuclear phagocytes in their ability to express the gene for IL-1 beta, which could explain the differences observed in IL-1 production.\r"

The protective and reconstitutive activities of the rIL-1 are shown to correlate with increased CFU-culture frequency and total number, as well as increased cellularity in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, suggesting that this is one of their mechanisms of action. The sequence and timing of administration of human rIL-1 is critical for the protection or rescue of animals receiving DNA-damaging agents; maximal activity is achieved when IL-1 is given 20 h before insult or 48 h after alkylating agent administration. Minimal therapeutic activity is observed with IL-1 as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic disease compared with other biologic response modifiers including IFN-gamma.\r"

We reconstituted the coding sequence of the 152-residue mature protein and expressed it in Escherichia coli. rM IL-1 beta was purified to homogeneity and characterized by oligonucleotide and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Purified rM IL-1 beta exhibited biologic activity equivalent to 7.8 x 10(7) units/mg in the murine thymocyte proliferation assay and 9.9 x 10(3) units/mg in the human gingival fibroblast PGE2 production assay, indicative of species specificity. The isoelectric point of rM IL-1 was found to be 8.85. The circular dichroism spectrum revealed that the secondary structure of M IL-1 is indistinguishable from that of the human protein. Receptor binding studies indicated the rM IL-1 bound to murine EL-4.1 thymoma cells in a specific and dose-dependent fashion with an affinity of 32 pM. Competition binding data suggested that murine and human IL-1 compete for a single class of receptor. Antisera were generated in rabbits against both murine and human IL-1. Results of ELISA binding and antisera neutralization assays indicated that there are common antigenic sites between the two IL-1 beta molecules. These domains are of functional importance because they are capable of mediating the neutralization of biologic activity.\r"

Our studies have determined that the class I molecule Qa2, expressed on the surface of spleen cells and activated T cells, behaves as an integral membrane protein based on its ability to associate with detergent micelles. Studies utilizing two purified phospholipase C have revealed that although most (90 to 95%) of the Qa2 molecules expressed on the surface of resting spleen cells are released as intact 40-kDa polypeptides associated with beta 2-microglobulin, activated T cells contain a major cell subpopulation expressing lipase-resistant Qa2 molecules. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that L3T4+-activated T cells expressed lipase-sensitive Qa2 molecules, whereas Lyt-2+ cells express lipase-resistant forms of the Qa2 molecule. The relationship between the secreted form of the Qa2 molecule and the lipase-generated soluble Qa2 molecule was investigated. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, the secreted Qa2 molecules has a Mr of 39 kDa whereas the cell surface form released from either resting spleen or activated T cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C has a Mr of approximately equal to 40 kDa. Furthermore, the secreted Qa2 molecule lacks an epitope, cross-reacting determinant, often present on lipase-solubilized cell surface molecules. Thus, based on serologic and biochemical criteria, the soluble Qa2 molecules generated by an exogenous phospholipase C and the secreted Qa2 molecule are structurally distinct.\r"

Herein B cells from various tissues of newborns and adults were transformed by EBV and their Ig products were analyzed with isotype-specific mAb. Although IgG- and IgA-bearing B cells were present in the newborn, EBV transformed IgM-producing cells almost exclusively in both newborn blood and breast milk. IgM-secreting cells were derived from IgM+ B cells and IgM- pre-B cells present in neonatal blood, but only from IgM+ cells in adult blood. Whereas in adults most EBV-transformed cells produced IgM, producers of IgG and of IgA were present in frequencies that varied according to the tissue source. Precursors of IgG-producing cells were relatively abundant in blood, spleen, and tonsil, and relatively infrequent in bone marrow and appendix. EBV-inducible IgA producers were relatively concentrated in the appendix and to a lesser extent in tonsils and blood. Differences in the subclass composition of EBV-transformed populations of IgG- and IgA-producers were also observed for the various adult lymphoid tissues. IgG1-producing cells predominated in most tissues, and precursors of IgG2 were largely confined to the circulation. Whereas IgA1-producing cells were predominant in all tissues, a marked enrichment in IgA2-producers was observed in the appendix. These results indicate a remarkable heterogeneity in the isotype distribution pattern of EBV-transformable B cells that is determined both by developmental age and tissue localization. We propose that EBV selectively transforms primed B cells, the isotype commitment of which varies according to tissue origin and age.\r"

A temperature-sensitive mutant (ts-4) strain of T. gondii was used for immunization because it causes infection but does not persist in the host. Immunization with this strain induced marked resistance against lethal challenge infection with virulent strains of T. gondii in mice. The resistance could be transferred to normal recipient mice by i.v. injection of spleen cells from ts-4-immunized mice. Marked inhibition of cyst formation in the recipient mice was also noted. The protective activity of immune spleen cells was removed by pretreatment of the spleen cells with anti-Thy-1.2 and C, indicating that T cells are responsible for the observed protection. Pretreatment of immune spleen cells with anti-Lyt-2.2 and C completely ablated their protective effect; pretreatment with anti-Lyt-1.2 or anti-L3T4 and C had lesser effects on their ability to transfer resistance. The effect of anti-Lyt-1.2 was the same as that obtained with anti-L3T4. This suggested that one T cell subset that is partially responsible for protection has both Lyt-1.2 and L3T4 markers on the cell surface. These results indicate that there are substantial roles for both the Lyt-2+ and Lyt-1+, L3T4 T cell subsets in dual regulation of resistance against toxoplasma infection and that Lyt-2+ T cells are the principal mediator of the resistance.\r"

Affinities of antibody elicited by vaccination with PRP and PRP-diphtheria toxoid conjugate were determined using oligosaccharides (OS) from PRP. The affinities of antibody induced by vaccination with PRP to OS of three and four repeat units were similar but greater than the affinity to the two-unit OS. NaBH4 reduction of the three-unit OS did not alter the binding affinity, indicating that the reducing end of the OS did not participate in antibody binding. Over the range of OS concentrations tested, antibody affinity appeared to be homogeneous. Antibody concentration could be determined from binding experiments independently from affinity. Whole serum had 8- to 40-fold less antibody detected by binding analysis than by RIA, but the antibody concentration of an IgG fraction measured by the two methods agreed within a factor of two. We could not account for the discrepancy in concentrations found with whole serum by the presence of IgM or IgA antibody. The average affinity of antibodies of 10 adults vaccinated with PRP was similar to that of antibodies elicited in 14 adults vaccinated with a PRP-diphtheria toxoid conjugate (10.7 x 10(5) vs 7.6 x 10(5) liter/mol, respectively, p greater than 0.05). We conclude that the intrinsic affinity of antibody after vaccination with PRP is low and is not different from that of antibody elicited by PRP diphtheria toxoid conjugate.\r"

One of the factors influencing this is the affinity of the antibody component for the target cell Ag. Multiple epitopes on carcinoembryonic Ag have been mapped providing a range of mAb of known specificity. These have been used to show that the cytotoxicity of an immunotoxin containing RTA conjugated to an anti-carcinoembryonic Ag mAb (228-RTA) is potentiated by mAb recognizing different epitopes. The potentiating antibodies also increased the level of target cell binding of antibody 228. Cross-linking of cell bound antibody was not involved because monovalent fragments of a potentiating antibody were effective. The potentiating antibodies modified the binding affinity of 228 antibody increasing the t1/2 of antibody at the tumor cell surface. This increased the dwell time of cell bound antibody and using conjugates of 228 linked to albumin-tetramethylrhodamine it was shown to enhance conjugate endocytosis. These investigations indicate that enhanced antibody affinity leads to increased endocytosis of bound immunoconjugate and potentiates cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Murine splenocytes incubated for 3 to 4 days with the lymphokine, IL-2, acquire the ability to mediate the lysis of a wide variety of fresh tumor targets in short term chromium release assays. We undertook these studies to examine the lysis of splenocyte blasts by these lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, to help gain an understanding of the mechanisms of target cell recognition. Allogeneic blast targets but not syngeneic blasts are highly lysable by LAK effector cells. By using congenic mice, we have shown that only the H-2 haplotype, and not other differences, determines the recognition and lysis of a blast target cell. Both Con A- and LPS-induced allogeneic splenocyte blasts are lysed and thus lectin-induced binding of effectors and targets is unlikely to be responsible for this effect. By using in vivo antibody depletion experiments, we showed that different populations of effector cells mediate the lysis of tumor cells and allogeneic blasts. Furthermore, we observed that the lysis of a susceptible blast can be inhibited only by like cold blasts of the same haplotype. These results suggest that there is a separate population of LAK cells responsible for the lysis of each type of blast target cell. Though syngeneic blasts were not lysed by LAK cells, TNP modification of syngeneic blasts converted them into cells that were recognized and lysed by LAK cells. In cold target inhibition studies, the lysis of fresh syngeneic tumor was not inhibited by TNP-modified syngeneic blasts. Similarly, the lysis of TNP-modified syngeneic blasts was not inhibited by fresh tumor. By using in vitro antibody depletion, we determined that TNP-modified blasts are lysed by LAK cells with Thy-1+ precursors, in distinction to the Thy-1- precursors involved in tumor cell lysis. Elimination of the Thy-1+ cells at the precursor stage completely abrogated the lysis of blasts but did not diminish the lysis of tumor cells. We conclude that IL-2 promotes the growth of numerous populations of effector cells with Thy-1+ precursors that have a narrow range of specificity, in contrast to the broad lytic ability for fresh tumor mediated by LAK cells with Thy-1- precursors.\r"

  ".U": "88229109\r", 
  ".W": "These findings characterize a 95-kDa glycoprotein on the surface of B lymphocytes recognized by the mAb G28-8. This protein (designated Bgp95), previously classified as a CD39 molecule, is unique based on functional, cell distribution, and immunochemical criteria. Biochemical analyses revealed that Bgp95 is a 95-kDa glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrate and is reduced to about 70-kDa after treatment with endoglycopeptidase F. In functional studies, stimulation by G28-8 mAb or its F(ab')2 fragments induced a G0 to G1 cell cycle transition and was synergistic with PMA, anti-mu, or anti-CDw40 in stimulating proliferation of resting B cells. G28-8 mAb also could induce increases of cytoplasmic free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i in a subpopulation of tonsillar or peripheral blood B cells. The G28-8 mAb alone induced a steady increase in [Ca2+]i detectable even 1 h after stimulation. Cross-linking the G28-8 mAb with a second mAb specific for murine kappa light chains induced a more rapid increase of [Ca2+]i which peaked at 10 to 20 min and then declined. At 1 h after stimulation, [Ca2+]i was higher in B cells stimulated with G28-8 alone than in B cells stimulated with G28-8 plus anti-kappa. The same conditions of cross-linking with the anti-kappa which increased the kinetics of the [Ca2+]i response decreased the proliferative response which otherwise followed co-incubation of the mAb with B cell growth factor or PMA. Thus, conditions leading to rapid but transient [Ca2+]i increase via Bgp95 may not be as effective at stimulating B cell proliferation as conditions favoring a slower prolonged [Ca2+]i response. Although the Bgp95 molecule is present on activated buoyant tonsillar B cells, mAb to Bgp95 did not trigger [Ca2+]i increases in these cells. These results suggest that the Bgp95 protein may function in early B cell activation and that its signal mechanisms are altered by the activation state of the cell.\r"

This rapid readout of TCR perturbation enabled us to monitor the formation of stimulatory Ag-MHC complexes on EBV-transformed B cells that were either pulsed with native tetanus toxoid (TT) or with a 12-amino-acid fragment of this protein. Neither unpulsed APC nor Ag-specific APC that were pulsed with native Ag and kept at +4 degrees C were able to induce changes in basal T cell [Ca2+]i in TT-specific T cell clones. After 1 h at 37 degrees C, however, the Ag-pulsed APC were able to induce a three-to-fourfold increase in [Ca2+]i. This length of time appeared to be almost independent of the concentration of Ag with which the APC were pulsed, suggesting that the lag time was due more to intracellular transit than to association of the processed Ag with the MHC molecule. Furthermore, the same lag time and independence of Ag concentration were found when the EBV-transformed B cells were pulsed with a mouse-anti-transferrin receptor mAb and tested for their capacity to trigger a T cell clone specific for processed mouse Ig. This indicates that, in addition to surface Ig, other receptors that are internalized can function in the same fashion in the uptake and processing of a soluble Ag. In contrast to what was found with intact native Ag, no lag time was observed when the APC were pulsed with high concentrations of a 12-amino-acid peptide, containing the amino acid sequence recognized by a TT-specific T cell clone, suggesting that the formation of MHC-peptide complexes occurs instantly. Pulsing with a lower peptide concentration, however, caused the appearance of a time-dependent increase in efficacy of Ag presentation, suggesting a slow accumulation of MHC-peptide complexes on the B cell membrane.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated diversity in the specificity of murine, H-2k class II-restricted, T cell clones for the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule of H3N2 influenza viruses and have mapped two T cell determinants, defined by synthetic peptides, to residues 48-68 and 118-138 of HA1. In this study we examine the nature of the determinant recognized by six distinct P48-68-specific T cell clones by using a panel of truncated synthetic peptides and substituted peptide analogs. From the peptides tested, the shortest recognized were the decapeptides, P53-62 and P54-63, which suggests that the determinant was formed from the 9 amino acids within the sequence 54-62. Asn54 was critical for recognition since P49-68 (54S) was not recognized by the T cell clones. Furthermore this peptide analog was capable of competing with P48-68 for Ag presentation, thereby suggesting that residue 54 is not involved in Ia interaction and may therefore be important for TCR interaction. Residue substitutions at position 63 also affected T cell recognition, but in a more heterogeneous fashion. Peptide analogs or mutant viruses with a single amino acid substitution at position 63 (Asp to Asn or Tyr) reduced the responses of the T cell clones to variable extents, suggesting that Asp63 may form part of overlapping T cell determinants. However since the truncated peptide P53-62 was weakly recognized, then Asp63 may not form part of the TCR or Ia interaction site, but may affect recognition through a steric or charge effect when substituted by Asn or Tyr. Ag competition experiments with the two unrelated HA peptides, P48-68 and P118-138, recognized by distinct T cell clones in the context of the same restriction element (I-Ak), showed that the peptides did not compete for Ag presentation to the relevant T cell clones, whereas a structural analog of P48-68 was a potent inhibitor. This finding is discussed in relation to the nature of the binding site for peptide Ag on the class II molecule.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the developmental pathways of T cells that bear TCR gamma delta, we have analyzed the kinetics of expression and biochemical characteristics of gamma delta receptors in the thymus and spleen of normal and athymic (nude) mice, as well as nude mice engrafted with neonatal thymuses. TCR gamma delta-bearing thymocytes and splenocytes have a CD4-8- phenotype, and both populations express products of the C gamma 1 locus. TCR gamma delta-bearing cells develop in the thymus before their appearance in the spleen. Young nude mice have no detectable TCR gamma delta-bearing cells in their spleens. When young nude mice are given thymus grafts, TCR gamma delta-bearing cells of host origin first develop in the engrafted thymus, followed by their appearance in the spleen. In the absence of a thymus graft, the spleens of old nude mice eventually develop small numbers of TCR gamma delta + cells, as well as TCR alpha beta + cells. These results demonstrate that there is a major thymic-dependent pathway for TCR gamma delta expression, as well as a minor thymic-independent pathway seen in older nude mice. The development of TCR gamma delta + cells in the thymus before their appearance in the spleen, both in normal ontogeny as well as in the thymus-engrafted nude mouse model, suggests that thymic TCR gamma delta + cells are precursors of the thymus-dependent population of peripheral TCR gamma delta + cells.\r"

We have found that previous anti-idiotypic manipulation of host mice by neonatal administration of suppressive doses of Ac 38 antibodies, or adult injection of enhancing doses of Ac 146 antibodies, modulated the T cell-independent Id response of either immature bone marrow or mature splenic responding cells, transferred from normal, untreated donors.

  ".W": "Altered expression of cell surface Ag is an early event accompanying Ag-, mitogen-, or phorbol ester-induced activation of mature T cells. In this report, phorbol ester-induced changes in the expression of several functionally significant cell surface molecules are explored on immature thymocytes and lymphoma cells presenting a cortical CD4+8+ double-positive (DP) phenotype. Both CD4 and CD8 expressions are down-modulated on DP cells incubated with PMA. Cell-surface expression of CD4 and CD8 remains depressed for 72 h in the presence of PMA, but is restored after removal of PMA from the culture medium. The PMA-mediated loss of Ag expression is associated with a rapid down-regulation of steady state CD4 and CD8 mRNA transcript levels in treated cells. The sustained loss of CD4 and CD8 surface expression on DP cells is a selective event because CD5 expression is enhanced, H-2 expression is unchanged, and CD3 expression is only transiently diminished by PMA stimulation. Other T cell-activating agents, including Con A, ionomycin, and anti-CD3 mAb, induce selected surface antigenic changes on DP cells, but do not mimic the pattern of altered Ag expression observed after PMA stimulation. These data demonstrate that, similar to mature subsets, T cells in the DP nonmature compartment undergo alterations in expression of functionally important cell-surface molecules in response to activating agents. Nevertheless, distinctions between mature and nonmature T cells regarding specific alterations in differentiation Ag phenotype suggest that the effect of PMA on expression of these molecules depends, in part, on the maturation stage of the target cell population.\r"

  ".U": "88229117\r", 
  ".W": "Previous experiments have demonstrated that the immune response of MHC congenic mice to pigeon cytochrome c is under Ir gene control. Expression of I-E-encoded gene products influences both the magnitude and fine specificity of the Th cell response to pigeon cytochrome c and phylogenetic derivatives. Results of those experiments implicate both determinant selection and repertoire selection as mechanisms of Ir gene control in this system. In this report we have compared the TCR expressed in pigeon cytochrome c-reactive Th cells from B10.A(I-Ek), B10.A(5R) (I-Eb), and B10.S(9R) (I-Es) mice. The B10.A(5R) strain is a low responder to pigeon cytochrome c, but in response to moth cytochrome c this strain produces T cells which respond to pigeon or moth cytochrome c on B10.A APC. These cells are phenotypically identical to the predominant clonal phenotype seen in the B10.A response to pigeon cytochrome c. In this report, we show that the B10.A and B10.A(5R) pigeon cytochrome c-reactive T cells express essentially identical T cell receptors. These results, coupled with recent studies reporting a relatively low affinity for I-Eb molecules by pigeon cytochrome c peptides compared with moth cytochrome c peptides, strongly argue that the immune response defect in the B10.A(5R) strain is due to a defect in Ag presentation (determinant selection). In contrast, B10.A and B10.S(9R) strains are high responders to pigeon cytochrome c. Both strains produce T cell clones which are capable of responding to cytochrome c presented by either B10.A or B10.S(9R) APC in vitro. We show that, even in T cells with this MHC restriction degeneracy, the TCR expressed in the two strains are different. Because the APC of both strains can clearly present the cytochrome c Ag, we conclude that the differential expression of the TCR in the responses is due to a T cell repertoire selection difference in the two strains. Thus, for the response to one Ag in three MHC congenic strains, there exists evidence that both determinant selection and repertoire selection can be mechanisms of Ir gene control of an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Although the precise mechanism of action of cyclosporine (CS) is unknown, there is substantial evidence that CS preferentially acts on T cells by impairing lymphokine production. Recent studies have demonstrated that CS may also inhibit the functions of accessory cells and APC. Since topically applied CS inhibits contact sensitivity and epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) are very effective accessory cells and APC, we determined whether CS directly affects their accessory cell functions. Murine LC were pulsed with solvent control or with various doses of CS (up to 10 micrograms/ml) and then Con A-induced T cell proliferation was assayed. CS pulsing of LC caused, when compared with solvent control-pulsed LC, a dose-dependent decrease in T cell stimulation (up to 93%). LC fixed with paraformaldehyde after 2-h CS pulsing showed a similar degree of decreased accessory cell function, indicating that the immunosuppressive action is established by 2 h. The inhibitory capacity of CS pulsing on LC is not likely to be related to diminished IL-1 production, enhanced PG biosynthesis, or decreased surface Ia Ag intensity. The possibility of carryover of CS into the culture supernatants was ruled out by adding CS-pulsed LC or their supernatants to other T cell proliferative assays. Thus, these studies indicate that CS directly inhibits accessory cell functions of LC.\r"

  ".U": "88229124\r", 
  ".W": "Previously it was demonstrated that the human autoreactive CD4+ T cell clone MTC-4 is bifunctional, having the capacity to augment differentiation of autologous B cells into Ig-secreting cells in the absence of PWM and the capacity to suppress such differentiation in the presence of PWM. In the present study it was shown that these two functions of MTC-4 are mediated by distinctly different mechanisms. In the presence of autologous class II MHC Ag, MTC-4 releases one or more non-MHC-restricted soluble factors which stimulate B cell differentiation. The helper factors are different from IL-2, and act on both resting (small) and activated (large) B cells. The suppressor function of MTC-4 cells is elicited when MTC-4 cells are co-cultured with autologous non-T cells preincubated with PWM for 4 h, but not with non-T cells preincubated with PWM for 24 h; thus, activated autologous non-T cells have a transient capacity to induce MTC-4 suppressor function. Induction of MTC-4 suppressor activity is not associated with increased proliferation of MTC-4 and is mediated by low numbers of these cells. Unlike helper function, MTC-4 suppression of Ig synthesis can occur late in B cell cultures, and MTC-4 suppresses Ig production by autologous B cells, but not by allogeneic B cells. Finally, in co-cultures with activated autologous non-T cells and allogeneic B cells, MTC-4 can simultaneously produce helper factors that augment Ig synthesis by allogeneic B cells and suppress Ig synthesis by autologous B cells. In summary, exposure of MTC-4 to autologous non-T cells causes release of non-MHC-restricted factors which augment Ig production by both resting and activated autologous B cells, whereas exposure of MTC-4 to recently activated B cells causes MTC-4 to express the additional function of directly suppressing Ig production by differentiated autologous B cells. Thus autoreactive T cells may be uniquely suited to regulate Ig production.\r"

By fusing the EBV-transformed cells generated from CD5+ B lymphocytes with human-mouse heterohybrid cells, we constructed continuous cell lines producing mAb. These mAb bound not only to the Fc fragment of IgG but also at varying degrees to other self-Ag, such as ssDNA, thyroglobulin, and insulin, as well as to exogenous Ag, such as tetanus toxoid, LPS from Gram-negative and polysaccharides from Gram-positive bacteria. Competitive inhibition studies revealed that although each of the mAb reacted with the Fc fragment of IgG, their functional affinities for other Ag varied by as much as 1000-fold. Our studies argue that broad polyreactivity is an inherent property of the antibodies produced by CD5+ B lymphocytes and that these antibodies may be what has been referred to as the \"natural antibodies\" of the serum.\r"

A significant positive correlation was found between the property of TCC to induce or enhance spontaneous IgE synthesis and their ability to release IL-4. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between the IgE helper activity of TCC and their ability to release IFN-gamma, whereas no statistical correlation between the property to induce IgE synthesis and to produce IL-2 was observed. The ability of PHA-SUP from 71 CD4+ TCC to induce IgE synthesis in B cells was also investigated. Twenty-nine SUP (all derived from TCC active on IgE synthesis) induced production of substantial amounts of IgE in target B cells. There was a correlation between the amount of IgE synthesized by B cells in response to these SUP and their IL-4 content. An even higher correlation was found between the IgE synthesis induced by these SUP and the ratio between the amount of IL-4 and IFN-gamma present in the same SUP. Like IL-4-containing SUP, rIL-4 also showed the ability to induce IgE production in B cells from both atopic and nonatopic donors. The addition to B cell cultures of anti-IL-4 antibody virtually abolished not only the IgE synthesis induced by rIL-4, but also that stimulated by TCC and their SUP. In contrast, the IgG synthesis induced by TCC SUP was not or only slightly inhibited by the anti-IL-4 antibody. These data indicate that IL-4 is an essential mediator for the IgE synthesis induced in vitro by human TCC and their SUP in the absence of a polyclonal activator, whereas IFN-gamma seems to exert a negative regulatory effect on the production of IgE.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of mouse CD4+ inducer T cells at the clonal level has established that a dichotomy among CD4+ T cell clones exists with regard to types of lymphokines secreted. Mouse T cell clones designated Th1 have been shown to secrete IL-2 and IFN-gamma, whereas T cell clones designated Th2 have been shown to produce IL-4 but not IL-2 or IFN-gamma. To determine if such a dichotomy in the helper inducer T cell subset occurred in man, we examined a panel of human CD4+ helper/inducer T cell clones for patterns of lymphokine secretion and for functional activity. We identified human T cell clones which secrete IL-4 but not IL-2 or IFN-gamma, and which appeared to correspond to murine Th2 clones. In marked contrast to murine IL-2 secreting Th1 clones which do not produce IL-4 or IFN-gamma, we observed that some human T cell clones secrete IL-2, and IFN-gamma as well as IL-4. Southern blot analysis indicated that these multi-lymphokine-secreting clones represented the progeny of a single T cell. IL-4 secretion did not always correlated with enhanced ability to induce Ig synthesis. Although one T cell clone which secreted IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma could efficiently induce Ig synthesis, another expressed potent cytolytic and growth inhibitory activity for B cells, and was ineffective or inhibitory in inducing Ig synthesis. These results indicate that although the equivalent of murine Th2 type cells appears to be present in man, the simple division of T cells into a Th1 and Th2 dichotomy may not hold true for human T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have shown that antibodies specific for C-reactive protein determinants, not present on the native molecule, termed neo-CRP, also react with a significant percentage of PBL. In the present study, cells were evaluated by flow cytometry using alpha-neo-CRP antisera and mAb specific for lymphocyte subsets. With use of either monocyte-depleted PBL or Percoll-enriched large granular lymphocytes, we observed an overlap between cells reactive with alpha-neo-CRP and cells bearing the surface markers CD16, CD11b, Leu-7, and/or Leu-19, which are expressed on NK cells. In addition, we showed co-expression of the neo-CRP antigen with CD19, CD20, and HLA-DR, cell surface markers which are expressed on B lymphocytes. The major proportion of CD3+ cells failed to exhibit co-expression of neo-CRP. Single parameter flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that cells reactive with alpha-neo-CRP exhibited a bimodal staining pattern based on fluorescence intensity: high intensity neo-CRPbright and low intensity neo-CRPdim. Two-color analysis revealed that neo-CRPbright cells co-expressed CD19, CD20, and HLA-DR, whereas neo-CRPdim cells co-expressed CD16, CD11b, Leu-7, and Leu-19. Anti-neo-CRP also reacted with PBL obtained from patients with CD16+ lymphoproliferative disorders and from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B cell origin, but not with cells from patients with T cell or myeloid leukemias. The alpha-neo-CRP cells from patients with NK cell expansions showed dim fluorescence, whereas patients with B cell expansions showed bright fluorescence, consistent with the staining patterns observed with normal PBL. In addition, cell lines of T cell, B cell, NK cell, myeloid, and erythroid origin were evaluated for reactivity with alpha-neo-CRP. The cloned NK cell line NK 3.3 reacted as neo-CRPdim, but the B cell lines BL41, BL41/95, T1, T2, and CESS all reacted as neo-CRPbright. The cell lines K562, Molt-4, Hut-78, HL-60, U-937, and THP-1-0, which lack characteristic NK and B cell markers, did not react with alpha-neo-CRP. Additional study of the two-color histograms revealed a distinct diagonal staining pattern that was observed only when cells were co-stained with alpha-neo-CRP and either alpha-CD16 (alpha-Fc gamma RIII) or antibody IV3 (alpha-CDw32; alpha-Fc gamma RII). This finding suggests a 1:1 relationship between Fc gamma R on both NK and B cells and determinants recognized by alpha-neo-CRP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Administration of the pituitary hormone alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) to mice was found to inhibit a number of IL-1 and TNF-inducible biologic responses in situ. The ability of either IL-1 or TNF to cause fever, enhance plasma levels of acute phase proteins, and increase the numbers of peripheral blood neutrophils was inhibited by the simultaneous peripheral administration of this neuropeptide. In addition, alpha-MSH reversed the depressive influences of IL-1 or TNF on the effector phase of contact hypersensitivity (CH) responses in animals given an adoptive transfer of primed lymphocytes from hapten-sensitized donors. Intracerebral injection of nanogram quantities of alpha-MSH inhibited the ability of peripherally administered IL-1 or TNF to induce both fever and neutrophilia without affecting the increase in plasma levels of serum amyloid P and fibrinogen. Also, nanogram quantities of alpha-MSH given intracerebrally to normal mice did not reverse the depressed CH responses observed after peripheral IL-1 or TNF administration. These findings suggest that both fever and neutrophilia are linked to the direct action of IL-1 or TNF on the brain. This was supported by the observation that an intracerebral injection of IL-1 or TNF in low doses increased core body temperature and circulating neutrophil numbers without affecting plasma levels of acute phase proteins or CH responsiveness. Our results provide additional support for the hypothesis that bidirectional control exists between elements of the neuroendocrine and immune systems.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of the enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) plays an important role in T cell activation. We investigated the phosphorylation of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD28 (Tp44), CD43 (sialophorin, gp115), and LFA-1 after incubation of human PBMC with the (PKC) activator PMA. These proteins were chosen for their role in transmembrane signal transduction (CD2, CD3, CD5, CD28, CD43), cell-cell interaction and adhesion (CD2, CD4, CD8, and LFA-1), or involvement in immunodeficiency states (CD43, CD7). CD5, CD7, CD43, and the alpha-chain of LFA-1 were found to be constitutively phosphorylated. PMA induced rapid hyperphosphorylation of CD5, CD7, and CD43, but not of the LFA-1 alpha-chain, and induced the phosphorylation of CD3, CD4, CD8 and of the LFA-1 beta-chain. PMA did not cause the phosphorylation of CD2 and CD28. PMA-induced phosphorylation was partially inhibited by the PKC inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride. Finally, the T cell activator Con A, which binds to the CD3/TCR complex was shown to induce a profile of protein phosphorylation similar to that observed with PMA. We conclude that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of T cell Ag may represent an important regulatory mechanism that governs the process of T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "88229148\r", 
  ".W": "EBV infects human B lymphocytes and induces them to proliferate, to produce Ig, and to give rise to immortal cell lines. Although the mechanisms of B cell activation by EBV are largely unknown, the continuous proliferation of EBV-immortalized B cells is dependent, at least in part, upon autocrine growth factors produced by the same EBV-infected B cells. In the present studies we have examined the influence of monocytes on B cell activation by EBV and found that unlike peripheral blood T cells and B cells, monocytes enhance by as much as 30- to 50-fold virus-induced B cell proliferation and Ig production. Upon activation with LPS, monocytes secrete a growth factor activity that promotes both proliferation and Ig secretion in EBV-infected B cells and thus reproduces the effects of monocytes in these cultures. Unlike a number of other factors, rIFN-beta 2/B cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2)/IL-6 stimulates the growth of human B cells activated by EBV in a manner similar to that induced by activated monocyte supernatants. In addition, an antiserum to IFN-beta that recognizes both IFN-beta 1 and IFN-beta 2 completely neutralizes the B cell growth factor activity of activated monocyte supernatants. These findings demonstrate that IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6 is a growth factor for human B cells activated by EBV and suggest that this molecule is responsible for B cell growth stimulation induced by activated monocyte supernatants. We have examined the possibility that IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6 might also be responsible for B cell growth stimulation by supernatants of EBV-immortalized B cells and thus may function as an autocrine growth factor. However, IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6 is not detectable in supernatants of EBV-immortalized B cells by immunoprecipitation. Also, an antiserum to IFN-beta that neutralizes IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6 fails to neutralize autocrine growth factor activity. This suggests that autocrine growth factors produced by EBV-immortalized B cells are distinct from IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6. Thus, the continuous proliferation of EBV-immortalized B cells is enhanced by either autocrine or paracrine growth factors. One of the mediators with paracrine growth factor activity is IFN-beta 2/BSF-2/IL-6.\r"

In this study, we selected SV40 T Ag-positive cell lines which had lost one or more of the antigenic sites, by in vitro cocultivation of a SV40-transformed B6 mouse kidney cell line (K-0) with SV40 T Ag site-specific CTL clones, Y-1 (site I specific), Y-2 (site II specific), Y-3 (site III specific), and Y-4 (site IV specific). All of the CTL-resistant cell lines expressed large quantities of cell surface H-2 class I Ag. K-1 cells selected by CTL clone Y-1 lost the expression of antigenic sites I, II, and III, but not site IV. K-2 and K-3 cells selected by CTL clones Y-2 and Y-3, respectively, were found to be negative for sites II and III but expressed sites I and IV. K-4 cells selected by CTL clone Y-4 lost the expression of only site IV. K-1,4 cells (sites I-, II-, III-, IV-) were selected from K-1 cells by cocultivation with CTL clone Y-4, K-2,4 cells (sites I+, II-, III-, IV-) were selected from K-2 cells by CTL clone Y-4. K-3,1 cells (sites I-, II-, III-, IV+) were selected from K-3 cells by CTL clone Y-1, and K-3,1,4 cells (sites I-, II-, III-, IV-) were selected from K-3,1 cells by CTL clone Y-4. From K-4 cells, K-4,1 cells (sites I-, II-, III-, IV-) and K-4,3 cells (sites I+, II-, III-, IV-) were selected by CTL clone Y-1 and Y-3, respectively. The antigenic site loss variant cell lines K-1, K-1,4, K-3,1 K-3,1,4, K-4,1, and K-4,3 synthesized SV40 T Ag molecules of 75, 75, 78, 78, 81, and 88 kDa, respectively. Expression of wild-type SV40 T Ag in the antigenic site loss variants by infection with SV40 or transfection with cloned SV40 DNA restored the CTL recognition sites on the variant cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maintenance of serologic determinants has been demonstrated. However, decreased lysis by allospecific CTL populations of cell lines that expressed a hybrid interspecies class I molecule, Kb1+2/A2, as compared with lines that expressed the native Ag, H-2Kb, has been described. An analysis with a limited panel of H-2Kb allospecific clones demonstrated that not all H-2Kb-specific CTL can lyse cells that express Kb1+2/A2 Ag. This suggested that the reduction of lysis by CTL populations was due to the loss of specific alloreactive clones in the population. Each clone used in this study was then defined as having high or low affinity characteristics. No correlation between the affinity of the CTL and the ability to recognize the interspecies hybrid molecule could be shown. Rather, these data suggest that antigenic determinants that are located within the polymorphic domains, alpha-1 and alpha-2, may be conformationally influenced by the alpha-3 domain.\r"

Mean percentages of active rosette-forming cells (ARFC) as well as the fraction resistant to theophylline incubation (ARFC-res) were significantly decreased, irrespective of the variety of the disease, compared to the age-matched controls. Late (\"cold\") rosette-forming fractions were unimpaired. The theophylline-sensitive fraction of total rosette-forming cells (TRFC-sens), which contains mainly cells from the suppressor circuit, was found to be lowered in all patients groups studied, whereas the ARFC-sens fraction was significantly decreased only in patients with diffuse scleroderma over 50 years of age, in whom there was a tendency to a more severe course, as manifested by pronounced systemic organ involvement. The lowered values of E rosette tests were found in a majority of SSc patients and were correlated with the appearance in the sera of factors capable of inhibiting ARFC formation by normal human peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Normal values of the E rosette test were related to the presence in the patients' sera of factors stimulating ARFC formation by normal lymphocytes. We surmise from the results that in SSc patients the T-cell defect is not only restricted to T suppressor cells but also refers to the active theophylline-resistant fraction containing mainly T inducer and T cytotoxic cells.\r"

At entry, of the 38 asymptomatic, exposed partners, 21 were seronegative, and results of western blot analysis showed that seven had antibody to HSV type 1 (HSV-1), four to HSV type 2 (HSV-2), and six to both HSV-1 and HSV-2. One of the 28 exposed partners without antibody to HSV-2 at enrollment asymptomatically acquired HSV-2 infection, but four of 10 with antibody to HSV-2 at enrollment developed culture-proven HSV-2 infection during follow-up. Restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA from paired isolates revealed identical strains in three couples and different strains in one. In this group of asymptomatic sex partners of persons with genital herpes, asymptomatic and unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 infection was common, but more than half of the exposed partners remained free of HSV-2 infection after a median of 16 mo of sexual contact.\r"

Detection of antibodies to ICP-35 proteins correlated best with the magnitude of vaginal viral replication. Animals that developed antibody to ICP-35 proteins had more-frequent recurrences (P less than .0002) that were of longer duration (P less than .005) than animals that did not. By covariate analysis the number of recurrences appeared to be related to the severity of the acute disease, inversely related to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer of antibody to HSV glycoproteins, and related to the detection of antibody to ICP-35 proteins. The duration of recurrent disease, however, could only be correlated with the presence of antibody to ICP-35 proteins. Detection of antibody to ICP-35 proteins is thus a useful prognostic indicator for identifying animals that developed more-severe recurrent disease.\r"

The correlation of the emission scan with the reconstructed transmission data allowed accurate anatomical localization of the infusate distribution. In seven patients, catheter placement resulted in perfusion to nontumor sites, and hence required repositioning. MAA accumulation was seen in the lungs of all patients, regardless of tumor site, indicating arterio-venous shunting of the MAA. The degree of uptake in the lungs was quantified from planar anterior/posterior thorax images in terms of injected dose in ten patients, with values of 5-50% of injected dose present in the lungs.

For all analysis techniques, significantly higher LCMRGI values were consistently seen in the left mid and posterior temporal area and caudate nucleus relative to the right, and in the right occipital region relative to the left. The coefficient of variation of intrasubject regional differences (9.9%) was significantly smaller than the coefficient of variation for regions between subjects (16.5%). No differences were noted between the sexes and no effect of repeat procedures was seen in subjects having multiple scans. In addition, inter-regional LCMRGI correlations were examined both in values from the 20 normal subjects, as well as in a set of hypothetical \"abnormal\" values. Results were compared with those reported from other PET centers; despite certain methodological differences, the intersubject and inter-regional variation of LCMRGI is fairly constant.\r"

The major quantitative effect of this was a variation in the resolution of the system with direction. The consequences of this are likely to be of importance especially for single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging. The effect was produced by a combination of faults in the design and manufacture of the low energy collimators. It demonstrates the importance of making quantitative measurements of collimator performance in the quality control assessment of gamma camera systems. For SPECT imaging the replacement of lead foil collimators with cast collimators should be considered.\r"

Carbon-11 cyanoacetate is produced by reacting [11C]cyanide with bromoacetate. After hydrolysis, the resulting [11C]malonic acid is purified and complexed to (diaquo) (ethylenediamine) platinum(II). Each step of the synthesis was optimized by studying the influence of different variables like reaction time and temperature, pH, necessary purification of intermediates, concentration and ratios of the reactants. Purification of the endproduct is achieved using preparative high performance liquid chromatography. The total incorporation of the [11C]cyanide in the final product was 17-40%. After approximately 1 hr, approximately 40 mCi of [11C]Ptenmal are produced in 10 ml sterile and isotonic dextrose solution ready for i.v. injection. The specific activity is approximately 200 mCi/mumol at EOB.\r"

We determined the ability of interleukin-2 (IL-2), an NKC stimulator, to enhance defective neonatal NKC to virus-infected cells. Human recombinant IL-2-stimulated adult and cord blood NKC to herpes simplex virus-infected cells in a time-dependent and dose-dependent fashion. The highest level of neonatal IL-2-stimulated cytotoxicity approached the level of unstimulated cytotoxicity when adult cells are used. Single-cell experiments suggested that the cord blood defect was due not to decreased adherence but to lysis or recycling defects. IL-2 stimulated adhesion in the presence of antibody but had no stimulatory effect on antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The relative defects in IL-2 stimulation of neonatal NKC suggest that its lone use as a therapeutic or protective agent against herpes simplex virus infections is unlikely to be successful, and may require concomitant adult cells if NKC is a critical mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Successful cytogenetic studies were performed on 69 biopsies from 64 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma bearing a t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation. This translocation appears to be a primary abnormality associated with the development of certain B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We correlated the occurrence of secondary abnormalities, in addition to the t(14;18)(q32;q21), with histologic subtype to test the hypothesis that secondary abnormalities correlate with more aggressive histologic appearance. A large number of secondary abnormalities were identified, the most frequent being additional copies of chromosomes 7 (30%), 12 (22%), 18 (22%), 20 (16%), or 21 (14%), deletion of a portion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (17%), and either an additional chromosome 17 or an isochromosome for the long arm of chromosome 17 (13%). An extra chromosome 7 was highly associated with a diffuse histologic pattern; it was present in 52% of patients with a diffuse pattern and in only 15% of those with a follicular pattern (P = .002). A weaker association with a diffuse growth pattern was found for the addition of chromosome 17 or an i(17q); it was found in 24% of patients with a diffuse pattern and only 5% of those with a follicular pattern (P = .05). No other significant correlations between secondary chromosome abnormalities and histologic subtype were identified. Although the explanation for this association is not clear, it appears that patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas bearing the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation which also have an additional chromosome 7 are likely to exhibit a diffuse growth pattern.\r"

To investigate the relationship between complement and granulocyte activation, patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass received the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (orally and intravenously) and the antiplatelet drug dipyridamole. The continuous infusion of nifedipine (5.91 +/- 0.53 micrograms/kg body weight per hour) caused significantly lower levels of elastase in alpha-proteinase inhibitor complex and lactoferrin but not anaphylatoxin. Dipyridamole was without effect on complement and granulocyte activation during cardiopulmonary bypass.

Additional procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting in 62 patients, mitral valve replacement in 22, mitral valvuloplasty in 8, and miscellaneous procedures in 28. The 273 patients discharged from the hospital are the basis of this report. They have been followed up for 1253 patient-years. The range of follow-up is 1 to 11 years, and the mean is 4.6 years. The 5-year survival rate for all patients was 68%, whereas for aortic valve replacement alone it was 76%. The incidences of embolism, thrombosis, bleeding, periprosthetic leak, valve infection, and reoperation per 100 patient-years were 1.5, 0.2, 2.0, 0.8, 0.7, and 1.3, respectively. The 5-year rates of freedom from embolism, thrombosis, bleeding, periprosthetic leak, valve infection, reoperation, and any valve-related complication were 94%, 99%, 91%, 96%, 97%, 94%, and 76%, respectively. Four of 16 patients who required reoperation had a properly functioning valve whose effective orifice area was too small for the cardiac output. Each of these valves was of the smaller size. There were no instances of mechanical valve failure. The Lillehei-Kaster aortic valve prosthesis is an excellent aortic valve substitute in the larger sizes. It has an extraordinary record for mechanical durability and an excellent resistance to thromboembolism in patients receiving proper anticoagulation. The incidence of perivalvular leak and infection is similar to that of other prosthetic valves. However, it is not to be recommended in the smaller sizes because of an unfavorable ratio of effective orifice area to tissue diameter.\r"

Between 1977 and 1983, coronary bypass alone was performed on 58 patients (mean age 63 +/- 8 years). Preoperatively, 90% had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina, and 10% had class III or IV congestive heart failure. In 72% mitral regurgitation had been caused by coronary disease. Hospital mortality was 3.4% (2/58). At follow-up (100% complete, mean 4.3 years) 66% of survivors were functional classes I and II (compared with 7% preoperatively, p less than 0.0001). Of those patients who worked preoperatively, 84% returned to work. There were no reoperations. The 5-year survival was 77%. In the same period combined mitral valve replacement and coronary bypass was required in 20 unmatched patients with moderate mitral regurgitation and coronary disease. Indications for valve replacement included congestive heart failure (10 cases), high left atrial pressure (three cases), and mitral stenosis (four cases). In these patients with more advanced symptoms the hospital mortality was 25%, and the 5-year survival was 31%. Treatment of moderate mitral regurgitation and coronary disease by coronary bypass alone achieved excellent hospital survival and long-term functional stability without a subsequent valve operation.\r"

  ".W": "Surgical repair of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea requires the production of a seal able to resist cerebrospinal fluid pressure during the period of healing. Direct suturing, packing with muscle and fat grafts, and coverage with mucosal or muscle flaps have been effective in repairing most CSF leaks. Fibrin glue may enhance the results of a CSF leak repair by providing better adhesion of the graft and improving the initial seal during healing. A study was performed on 36 rats to assess the effectiveness of fibrin glue in repairing experimentally produced CSF leaks. CSF rhinorrhea was produced by creating a defect in the anterior cranial fossa through the region of the cribriform plate. There were four treatment groups: 1. no treatment control; 2. fibrin adhesive alone; 3. muscle packing alone; and 4. fibrin glue with muscle packing. The CSF leaks were evaluated 3 weeks after operation. Persistent CSF leakage was noted in 89% of group 1, 55% of group 2, 33% of group 3, and 22% of group 4. The reduced CSF leakage in the muscle plus fibrin glue group suggests that fibrin glue, by its adhesive sealing properties, enhances the results of muscle packing alone for the treatment of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.\r"

In 26% of the patients, IgA titers were above one standard deviation of controls, with highest levels noted in patients with advanced disease. In 40 patients for whom multiple immune parameters were tested in vitro, increasing concentrations of IgA were associated with an enhanced immunologic helper state defined by a generalized hypergammaglobulinemia, increased percentage of T4+ lymphocytes, higher T4/T8 ratio, and an increased lymphocyte blastogenesis response to mitogens. IgA concentrations were inversely related to percentages and absolute number of Leu 11+ natural killer cell subsets, and also to disease-free survival (p less than 0.005 by Cox proportional hazards model). The immune correlations identified here are similar to those noted in many autoimmune diseases. Head and neck cancer patients are an immunologically heterogeneous population, among whom elevated IgA blood levels may reflect the autoimmune nature of cancer, an immunologic state defined by its tumor-promoting capacity.\r"

  ".W": "The development of a goiter and hypothyroidism in a 28-year-old man in whom metastatic melanoma had been treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK cells) prompted us to assess thyroid function in patients undergoing this therapy. Thirty-four patients with advanced neoplasms who had received interleukin-2 and LAK cells were followed for at least four weeks after treatment. Seven patients (21 percent) had laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, with a decline in the serum thyroxine concentration to below normal (less than or equal to 35 nmol per liter; normal, 65 to 148), a decline in the serum free thyroxine index, and a rise in the serum thyrotropin concentration (peak values, 7.2 to 166 mU per liter; normal, 0.5 to 5.5) 6 to 11 weeks after treatment. Two patients had elevated serum thyrotropin levels before treatment, which increased further after treatment. In two patients, these abnormal values returned to normal within 10 months. All five symptomatic patients had borderline or elevated serum antimicrosomal antibody titers after treatment; two had serum antibodies to thyroglobulin. Five of the seven patients with hypothyroidism (71 percent) but only 5 of the 27 euthyroid patients (19 percent) had evidence of tumor regression (P less than 0.02). None of 11 patients treated with interleukin-2 but not LAK cells had hypothyroidism. We conclude that treatment with interleukin-2 and LAK cells can cause hypothyroidism, possibly by exacerbating preexisting autoimmune thyroiditis, and that it may be associated with a favorable tumor response.\r"

The protein-tyrosine kinases described to date are either transmembrane proteins having an extracellular ligand binding domain or cytoplasmic proteins related to the v-src oncogene. Most of these proteins are expressed in a wide variety of cells and tissues; few are tissue-specific. Previous studies have suggested that lymphokines could mediate haematopoietic cell survival through their action on glucose transport, regulated in some cells through the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. We have investigated the possibility that insulin receptor-like genes are expressed specifically in haematopoietic cells. Using the insulin receptor-related avian sarcoma oncogene v-ros as a probe, we have isolated and characterized the complementary DNA of a novel gene, ltk (leukocyte tyrosine kinase). The ltk gene is expressed mainly in leukocytes, is related to several tyrosine kinase receptor genes of the insulin receptor family and has unique structural properties: it apparently encodes a transmembrane protein devoid of an extracellular domain. Two candidate ltk proteins have been identified with antibodies in the mouse thymus, and have properties indicating that they are integral membrane proteins. These features suggest that ltk could be a signal transduction subunit for one or several of the haematopoietic receptors.\r"

The evaluation of patients included pre- and postoperative BAEP recordings and pure tone audiometry. The series included 25 tumors, 4 neurovascular decompressions, 1 basilar artery aneurysm, and 1 arteriovenous malformation. Two intraoperative findings correlated significantly with a postoperative decrease in hearing: an amplitude reduction of more than 50% for Waves I to V and the loss of one of the waves, even if it was a wave that first appeared intraoperatively. We could attribute no significance to reversible or irreversible latency increases for all waves. The transient loss of one of the peaks followed by its reappearance was also insignificant with regard to postoperative hearing. A good prognostic sign was the intraoperative appearance of a peak undetectable on the preoperative recordings. These findings suggest that in intraoperative BAEP monitoring the observation of amplitude reduction is more important than that of latency increases. The surgeon should be informed when an amplitude reduction of more than 50% occurs before the peak is lost totally, as it is impossible to predict whether this peak will reappear intraoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides that represent protein binding sites in the regulatory regions of the mouse genes encoding transthyretin (TTR) and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) bound a nuclear protein factor(s) found mainly in hepatocytes. A site in the regulatory region of the gene encoding rat serum albumin and, surprisingly, a region in the simian virus 40 enhancer also bind the same factor. Oligodeoxynucleotide affinity chromatography (with one of the TTR binding sites) allowed a 500-fold purification of the protein. The purified protein protected similar portions of all the regulatory regions, as well as the simian virus 40 core C enhancer element, from digestion with DNase I. A DNA-binding protein previously purified from liver by virtue of its ability to bind to several virus enhancer sequences also binds to TTR, alpha 1-AT, and albumin regulatory sites. Thus, all these binding sites, which contain only minimal sequence similarity, may bind to a single protein, or a similar family of proteins, that activates liver-specific transcription of coordinately expressed genes.\r"

  ".W": "Chloroplast genomes of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] and radiata (Monterey) pine [Pinus radiata D. Don], two conifers from the widespread Pinaceae, were mapped and their genomes were compared to other land plants. Douglas-fir and radiata pine lack the large (20-25 kilobases) inverted repeat that characterizes most land plants. To our knowledge, this is only the second recorded loss of this ancient and highly conserved inverted repeat among all lineages of land plants thus far examined. Loss of the repeat largely accounts for the small size of the conifer genome, 120 kilobase, versus 140-160 kilobases in most land plants. Douglas-fir possesses a major inversion of 40-50 kilobases relative to radiata pine and nonconiferous plants. Nucleotide sequence differentiation between Douglas-fir and radiata pine was estimated to be 3.8%. Both conifer genomes possess a number of rearrangements relative to Osmunda, a fern, Ginkgo, a gymnosperm, and Petunia, an angiosperm. Among land plants, structural changes of this degree have occurred primarily within tribes of the legume family (Fabaceae) that have also lost the inverted repeat. These results support the hypothesis that the presence of the large inverted repeat stabilizes the chloroplast genome against major structural rearrangements.\r"

  ".W": "Human alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-D-galactoside galactohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.22) is a lysosomal hydrolase encoded by a gene localized to the chromosomal region Xq22. The deficient activity of this enzyme results in Fabry disease, an X chromosome-linked recessive disorder that leads to premature death in affected males. For studies of the structure and function of alpha-galactosidase A and for characterization of the genetic lesions in families with Fabry disease, the full-length cDNA was isolated, sequenced, and used to screen human genomic libraries. The 1393-base-pair full-length cDNA had a 60-nucleotide 5' untranslated region and encoded a precursor peptide of 429 amino acids including a signal peptide of 31 residues. Three overlapping lambda clones spanning 32 kilobases were identified that contained the entire approximately equal to 12-kilobase chromosomal gene as well as approximately equal to 9 and approximately equal to 11 kilobases of 5' and 3' flanking sequence, respectively. The gene had seven exons. The genomic exonic and full-length cDNA sequences were identical. All intron-exon splice junctions conformed to the GT/AT consensus sequence. The 5' flanking region of this lysosomal housekeeping gene contained Sp1 and CCAAT box promoter elements as well as sequences corresponding to the activator protein 1 (AP1), octanucleotide (\"OCTA\"), and \"core\" enhancer elements. There was an upstream \"HTF\" island (Hpa II tiny fragments) followed by four direct repeats of the \"chorion box\" enhancer. The unique lack of a 3' untranslated sequence in the alpha-galactosidase A cDNA was confirmed by sequencing additional cDNA clones and the genomic 3' region.\r"

A cDNA library was constructed from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells from a male who was G6PD A(-). One of four cDNA clones isolated contained a sequence not found in the other clones nor in the published cDNA sequence. Consisting of 138 bases and coding 46 amino acids, this segment of cDNA apparently is derived from the alternative splicing involving the 3' end of intron 7. Comparison of the remaining sequences of these clones with the published sequence revealed three nucleotide substitutions: C33----G, G202----A, and A376----G. Each change produces a new restriction site. Genomic DNA from five G6PD A(-) individuals was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The base substitution at position 376, identical to the substitution that has been reported in G6PD A(+), was present in all G6PD A(-) samples and none of the control G6PD B(+) samples examined. The substitution at position 202 was found in four of the five G6PD A(-) samples and no normal control sample. At position 33 guanine was found in all G6PD A(-) samples and seven G6PD B(+) control samples and is, presumably, the usual nucleotide found at this position. The finding of the same mutation in G6PD A(-) as is found in G6PD A(+) strongly suggests that the G6PD A(-) mutation arose in an individual with G6PD A(+), adding another mutation that causes the in vivo instability of this enzyme protein.\r"

Protein M104E, a mouse myeloma protein that binds dextran, expresses a private idiotope that is present on a significant proportion of the normal dextran-specific antibody repertoire. Immunocompetent cells that bind and internalize M104E idiotype-bearing molecules were eliminated by the intravenous administration of a single dose of cytosine arabinonucleoside conjugated to purified M104E protein. The administration of this cytotoxic drug-idiotype conjugate had a profound effect upon the expression of the M104E idiotype in euthymic but not in athymic BALB/c mice following immunization with dextran. In euthymic mice, the depletion of the idiotype-binding cells resulted in a marked elevation in the level of M104E idiotype present in the immune sera. Moreover, treated but not control mice developed idiotype-positive molecules that did not bind dextran. These results demonstrate the functional significance of idiotype-binding cells in the regulation of individual clonotypes during an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate prokaryotic intracellular pathogen of humans that infects mucosal epithelial cells. Exposed domains of its major outer membrane protein (MOMP) are both serotyping and protective antigenic determinants. To identify these domains, we have cloned and epitope-mapped the genes of serovars A, C (C serogroup) and L2, B (B serogroup) with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Predominantly conserved regions of the genes of both serogroups are interspersed with four short variable domains (I-IV). Recombinant phage clones expressing specific MOMP antigenic determinants revealed that protective serotype-specific recognized epitopes in variable domains I and II. Protective subspecies and serogroup-specific mAbs recognized overlapping determinants in variable domain IV near the C terminus. A nonprotective species-specific mAb mapped to an invariant peptide of nine residues contained within variable domain IV. In the intact chlamydial organism of serovar B, variable domains II and IV were susceptible to proteolytic digestion, whereas both N and C termini were protected. These results suggest an arrangement of MOMP in the outer membrane in which three of the four variable domains are exposed to the outside and in which both N and C termini are presumably oriented toward the periplasmic space. This molecular analysis of MOMP antigenic determinants and their surface topology on intact chlamydiae will be useful toward the development of a recombinant subunit or synthetic chlamydial vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) activates phospholipase C in the basolateral membrane of the renal proximal tubular cell, we incubated basolateral membranes isolated from canine kidney with rat IGF-II (rIGF-II) and measured levels of inositol trisphosphate (Ins-P3) in suspensions and of diacylglycerol extractable from the membranes. Incubation with rIGF-II increased levels of Ins-P3 and diacylglycerol in a concentration-dependent manner. Significant enhancement of Ins-P3 levels and extractable diacylglycerol occurred in suspensions incubated with as little as 10(-10) M rIGF-II. Elevated levels of Ins-P3 were measured after as little as 5 sec of incubation. Increases were no longer detectable after 45 sec of incubation, due to dephosphorylation of Ins-P3 in membrane suspensions. Incubation with either insulin or insulin-like growth factor I did not affect the level of Ins-P3. IGF-II-stimulated increases in Ins-P3 did not occur when basolateral membranes were suspended in the absence of free calcium. Increases were demonstrable in basolateral membrane suspensions in 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 microM calcium, but not in 1.0 microM calcium. Inclusion of guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate in incubation mixtures did not increase levels of Ins-P3, nor did it enhance the action of rIGF-II in this regard. However, inclusion of guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate inhibited rIGF-II stimulation of Ins-P3 production. In contrast to findings with basolateral membrane suspensions, incubation with rIGF-II did not increase levels of Ins-P3 in suspensions of isolated brush-border membranes. Our data are consistent with IGF-II-mediated activation of phospholipase C in isolated proximal tubular basolateral membranes. Such an action could reflect the mechanism by which the IGF-II \"signal\" is transmitted across the basolateral membrane of the renal proximal tubular cell and by which the actions of this peptide are mediated in renal and non-renal cells.\r"

Forty-four rabbits were assigned to experimental or control groups and followed for four or seven days. We classified the groups as Exp4, Con4, Exp7, and Con7, respectively. Each animal was anesthetized, and a full-thickness incision, 3.5-cm long, was made on its back. After 24 hours, the Exp4 and Exp7 rabbits received high voltage electrical stimulation for two hours twice daily. Wound closure for the Exp4 rabbits (50%) was significantly less than that of the Con4 rabbits (78%). After seven days, however, the Exp7 and Con7 rabbits had similar wound-closure values (80% and 82%, respectively). Tensile-strength values for the control and experimental animals were comparable at both time periods. Histologic examination of the wounds suggested a more rapid rate of epithelization between the Exp4 and Exp7 rabbits compared with the Con4 and Con7 rabbits. The results of this study are inconclusive, but may indicate that positive-polarity stimulation enhanced wound closure between four and seven days of treatment.\r"
