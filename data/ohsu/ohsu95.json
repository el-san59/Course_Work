  ".W": "The aim was to determine whether retrograde jejunal pacing would slow gastroenteric transit and reduce stomal output of water and electrolytes in dogs with ileostomy. In five alert animals with an end ileostomy, and jejunal pacing and recording electrodes, 200 g of liver labeled with technetium Tc 99m and 50 mL of polyethylene glycol-labeled water were fed to each animal on eight occasions. In one half of the experiments, the jejunum was paced backward for the first three hours after the meal, while in the other half pacing was not done. Stomal output was collected for nine hours. In four other experiments per dog, gastric emptying of the meal was measured by scintigraphy and aspiration after three hours of pacing or control. Jejunal pacing delayed gastrointestinal transit of both liquids and solids, reduced stomal output, and increased fecal sodium concentration during the pacing period. Net postcibal absorption of water and electrolytes over nine hours, however, was not increased by pacing.\r"

The Rapid Solution Administration Set (RSAS) allows normothermic volume restoration at flow rates of up to 2200 mL/min via a single peripheral venipuncture. The RSAS was utilized in 33 consecutive multiple-trauma patients with a mean trauma score (TS) of 6.8. Admission systolic blood pressure averaged 66.9 mm Hg. A mean of 5692 mL of packed red blood cells, 5515 mL of blood products, and 12,052 mL of crystalloid solution per patient was infused within 24 hours of admission mostly via the RSAS. Mortality was 45% at 24 hours following arrival and 61% overall. The mortality was 93.8% (15/16) in patients with a TS of 5 or less and 29.4% (5/17) in patients with a TS over 5. The initial postinfusion patient temperatures averaged 35.2 degrees C. All abnormal preinfusion coagulation values normalized within 24 hours in the survivors, and no significant complications occurred with the use of the RSAS. The RSAS seems to provide an uncomplicated means of normothermic volume replacement. The 24-hour survival in potentially salvageable patients may be improved. Its use in patients with lethal injuries (TS less than or equal to 3) requires further evaluation.\r"

Forty-two patients consented to a follow-up study. The age of the patients did not affect survival. For patients with gastric cancer, those with distal cancer or an ulcer simulating cancer had had a better prognosis. Forty percent of the patients had had an early gastric cancer. Only two patients had had lymph node metastases in regional lymph nodes, and macroscopic tumor growth through the serosa had been recorded in only four cases. In 23 cases, a distal resection had proved successful. No significant correlation between intestinal or diffuse types of cancer and prognosis was observed. One recurrence after ten years was found; in one case, there was a new cancer in the gastric remnant. In addition, biopsy specimens from two patients showed grave dysplasia. We suggest that throughout their lives annual follow-up examinations be performed in patients who have undergone radical operations for gastric cancer.\r"

Nicotine did not cause contractions in the strip of the narrow portion of the cyst. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) induced atropine-sensitive, tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions in the bile ducts through bicuculline-sensitive, furosemide-sensitive GABAA receptors located on the postganglionic cholinergic neuron. The GABA did not induce contractions in the narrow portion of the cyst. The number of ganglion cells was decreased markedly in the same portion. These findings suggest that the choledochal cyst has postganglionic neural dysfunction. This character may be one of the causes of cyst formation.\r"

No significant treatment effect was found for the remaining 15 patients, who presented with mixed seizure types, multifocal electroencephalographic abnormalities, and high seizure frequencies. Tolerability to vigabatrin was good; the most frequently reported unwanted effect was drowsiness. Plasma concentrations of phenytoin showed a significant reduction during the vigabatrin period.

Tremor was assessed by patient opinion, clinical scoring, and accelerometer recordings. The amplitude and frequency of tremorgrams were determined by spectral analysis. Most patients preferred long-acting propranolol and chose to continue taking the drug. The mean clinical score for resting and postural tremor was significantly decreased by long-acting propranolol but not by primidone or clonazepam. Long-acting propranolol reduced the mean amplitude of resting tremor by 70% and the mean amplitude of postural tremor by 50%. Mean tremor amplitudes were not changed by primidone or clonazepam. Tremor frequency was unaltered by the drugs. No side effects occurred with long-acting propranolol but adverse reactions were common with primidone and clonazepam.

  ".W": "The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration test (BOMC), a six-item derivative of the Blessed Information-Memory-Concentration Test, were each administered to 36 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In 24 patients, both tests were readministered a month later. The correlation between the MMSE and BOMC was -0.83 with a test-retest correlation of 0.89 (MMSE) and 0.77 (BOMC). Factor analysis indicated that the multiple MMSE cognitive components could be explained by two factors, which together accounted for 66% of the variance. These factors are conceptually similar to the components of the BOMC, and so may explain the substantial correlation between the two tests. Since these cognitive status tests seem to be equivalent for Alzheimer patients, the briefer measure (BOMC), which offers additional advantages, may be preferred.\r"

Aside from mental status findings, the most useful examination findings for differentiating AD from control subjects were the presence of release signs, olfactory deficit, impaired stereognosis or graphesthesia, gait disorder, tremor, and abnormalities on cerebellar testing. These abnormalities probably reflect the different areas of the central nervous system that are affected pathologically in AD. In the clinical diagnosis of AD, particular attention should be given to these aspects of the neurologic examination.\r"

Some patients show bibrachial sensorimotor impairment and a disturbance of volitional saccadic eye movement caused by more anteriorly placed ischemia in the anterior-middle artery border zone. Some show a temporary dyslexia/dysgraphia and memory defect related to bilateral parietotemporal lesions in the middle-posterior border zone.\r"

Significant differences in VT indicate dysfunction of this sensory system in the cancer group. Twelve percent of the cancer patients had elevated VT compared with 1.7% of control subjects. Elevated VT was not associated with risk factors for neuropathy such as diabetes, renal disease, poor nutrition, or treatment with chemotherapy. Although VT elevation was associated with alcoholism and increasing age, these variables accounted for only a small proportion of the variance in VT. These data suggest that VT determinations are a useful method for quantifying sensory abnormalities in cancer patients. Sensory abnormalities occur in a significant proportion of patients with cancer and seem to be related directly to the neoplasm, rather than to known risk factors for neuropathy.\r"

Eleven (19.6%) of the 56 patients had electroencephalographic (EEG) activity following the diagnosis of brain death. The mean duration of the observed EEG activity was 36.6 hours (range, two to 168 hours). Three patterns of EEG activity were observed: (1) low-voltage (4 to 20 microV) theta or beta activity was recorded in nine (16.1%) patients as long as 72 hours following brain death. Neuropathologic studies in one patient showed hypoxic-ischemic neuronal changes involving all cell layers of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum; (2) sleep-like activity (a mixture of synchronous 30 to 40 microV theta and delta activity and 60 to 80 microV, 10 to 12 Hz spindle-like potentials) was noted in two (3.6%) patients for as long as 168 hours following brain death. Pathologic studies in both cases demonstrated ischemic necrosis of the brain stem with relative preservation of the cerebral cortex; and (3) alpha-like activity (monotonous, unreactive, anteriorly predominant, 25 to 40 microV, 9 to 12 Hz activity) was observed in one (1.8%) patient three hours following brain death. Regardless of activity on the EEG, none of the patients recovered. The occurrence of EEG activity following brain death would suggest reliance on the EEG to confirm brain death may be unwarranted. The use of the EEG as a confirmatory test of brain death may be of questionable value.\r"

Complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum was found in six patients, septal defects in three, and arhinencephaly and ammonic hypoplasia in one. Since malformation or limbic structures are, to our knowledge, a consistent feature of agenesis of the corpus callosum, it seems that limbic abnormalities could be important for the pathogenesis of mental retardation not only in Apert syndrome, but also in other acallosal patients.\r"

In this context, it is of interest to know how well color test performance correlates with an accepted measure of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, such as is provided by quantitative static perimetry. We found correlation values for 96 glaucoma suspects (ocular hypertensive patients) and 110 patients with POAG. No significant correlation values were found for the suspect group when age correction was applied to the color variable. Similarly, for the patients with POAG, age correction of the color test scores reduced all age group correlation values below significance, except for the age group 60 to 69 years. These findings conflict with another recent study reporting significant correlation between Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue color test scores and visual field performance for glaucoma suspects but which did not correct for age. We interpreted our results for the glaucoma suspects and patients with glaucoma to indicate some independence of mechanisms responsible for early color loss compared with visual field loss.\r"

Severe respiratory insufficiency frequently results in death in infancy, but several patients have been reported to survive to adulthood. For this reason the prognosis for patients with ocular abnormalities is of interest in counseling families. We report a sibship of two patients who showed evidence for progression by visual field and electroretinogram testing when followed up over 3.7 years. Progressive electroretinographic abnormalities consisted of the following: progressive decrease in responses mediated by dark-adapted rods and both dark- and light-adapted cones in the first patient and progressive increase in b-wave implicit time elicited by 30-Hz flicker stimulation in the second patient.\r"

  ".W": "We measured the temporal aspects of several components of the electroretinogram in 72 patients with diabetes and 29 control subjects. The measurements consisted of the implicit times of the a wave and oscillatory potentials elicited by a bright-flash stimulus and the implicit time of the b wave in response to a 30-Hz flickering light. The a wave and first three oscillatory potential nodes were significantly delayed in the patients with diabetes compared with the controls; among the diabetics, a significant increase in the delay of the second and third nodes occurred as a function of increasing retinopathy severity. Similarly, the 30-Hz flicker implicit times (with and without a background light) were significantly delayed in patients with diabetes, and the magnitude of the delay increased with increasing retinopathy severity. The correlations of 30-Hz flicker implicit times with retinopathy severity were significant for retinopathy level graded in color fundus photographs as well as for retinal capillary nonperfusion and leakage graded in fluorescein angiograms. A comparison of 30-Hz flicker implicit times in 15 patients with one eye treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation and the other eye untreated (treatment was randomly assigned) showed a significant delay in the treated eyes compared with the untreated eyes (paired eye comparison). This suggests that panretinal laser photocoagulation induces a further delay in the b-wave implicit times of eyes treated for diabetic retinopathy.\r"

Another new aspect is a genealogic analysis of the cardiovascular abnormalities found in members of families with Leber's disease. Our results suggest that every daughter and son of a female carrier inherits the trait, thus satisfying the criteria for a maternally inherited disease. Microangiopathy, without optic nerve dysfunction, probably represents the mildest stage of the disease. The high frequency of electrocardiographic abnormalities in the off-spring of the female carriers suggests an important link with Leber's disease.\r"

At the posterior pole, a lobular arrangement of the choriocapillaris is seen. At the equatorial area, the capillaries run a more direct course, joining the precapillary arterioles to the capillary venules in a spindle-shaped segment of the choroidal vasculature. At the periphery, the choroidal arterioles and venules take a parallel course, with the choriocapillaris joining the adjacent arterioles and venules at a right angle and appearing in a ladder pattern. The regional variation of the angioarchitecture of the human choroid provides supporting evidence for the unique regional characteristics of choroidal blood flow.\r"

Two months later, thermal tendinoplasty-treated extraocular muscles were surgically isolated and evaluated for strength. Biopsies were then performed on these muscles. It was our clinical impression that treated tissues retained their strength, while histologic and electron-microscopic evaluation of heat-treated tendon revealed evidence of shrinkage and compaction of collagen bundles. Thermal tendinoplasty may offer a sutureless method of correcting strabismus by shortening and thereby strengthening extraocular muscles.\r"

BMD was significantly reduced at both sites in these patients. Physical activity correlated significantly with BMD in patients with RA, and was found, by multiple regression analysis, to be a significant predictor of femoral bone density in female patients. Multiparity exerted a protective effect on lumbar bone density. Prednisolone (mean dosage 8 mg/day) was not associated with significantly increased bone loss in women, whereas higher dosages in men (mean 10.3 mg/day) were associated with increased lumbar bone loss. Reduced physical activity leading to a form of disuse osteoporosis appears to be an important factor in axial bone loss in RA.\r"

No correlation could be found between ACL antibody levels and recurrent thrombosis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis there was a significant correlation between ACL antibodies and a history of repeated abortions. No significant association was found between ACL antibodies and other autoantibodies except in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; ACL antibody-positive rheumatoid arthritis patients were much more likely to be antinuclear antibody-positive (P less than 0.0002).\r"

At the molecular weight and concentration of hyaluronate present in normal synovial fluid, proliferation was inhibited. At lower molecular weights or concentrations, as found in rheumatoid synovial fluid, hyaluronate was significantly less inhibitory. Thus, the changes in synovial fluid hyaluronate that are associated with arthropathies may contribute to a favorable environment for rheumatoid pannus expansion.\r"

The GAGs were depleted mainly in the superficial zone of the cartilage. Although the thickness of the uncalcified cartilage was not decreased, the calcified cartilage under the tidemark was thinned by 6-25% at the femoral condyles. The increased weight-bearing in the limb opposite the one in the splint caused uncalcified cartilage thickness to be augmented by 19% and GAG concentration by 25-35% in the intermediate, deep, and calcified zones of the summits of the femoral condyles; the changes were smaller in other, less loaded parts of the joint. It is concluded that in young dogs, increased weight-bearing augments local proteoglycan content of the articular cartilage matrix, while unloading reduces it.\r"

Effectiveness in 46 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was 28.1% at a dosage of 1.25 mg, 52.2% at 2.5 mg, 69.6% at 5 mg and 78.3% at 10 mg of ramipril alone. In 27 patients receiving baseline therapy with a thiazide diuretic, a subsequent administration of ramipril showed effectiveness in 11.1% for 1.25 mg, 48.1% for 2.5 mg and 70.4% for 5 mg. Adverse effects occurred in 11.7% of patients overall and were not serious. One patient was withdrawn because of severe headache; the other patients tolerated the treatment well. A dosage of 2.5 to 10 mg of ramipril will probably be appropriate for further evaluation of the effectiveness of this agent in a double-blind study.\r"

  ".W": "To study the role of genetic factors in the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, dams of two rat lines developed to differ in voluntary alcohol intake, alcohol-preferring (AA) and alcohol-avoiding (ANA) rats were given a 5-10% alcohol solution mixed with a 1% sucrose solution as a sole drinking liquid throughout gestation. Sleep-wake behaviour of the offspring was studied at the ages of 7, 14 and 20 days, using a movement-sensitive mattress. In ANA rats, sleep recordings showed that prenatal alcohol exposure increased the percentage of waking but decreased the percentage of active sleep. Sleep-wake behaviour of the AA rats was not affected by alcohol exposure in utero. Prenatal alcohol exposure did not change open field behaviour in 1 month old rats, except that the alcohol-exposed AA rats' defaecation was decreased. When rats were 3 months old, voluntary intake of 10% (v/v) alcohol increased for alcohol-exposed ANA rats and decreased for alcohol-exposed AA rats as compared to the controls. The results indicate that AA rats may compensate for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on behaviour, whereas offspring of the alcohol-exposed ANA dams suffer from severe behavioural disturbances. These findings further suggest that genetic factors are responsible for the differences in the susceptibility of rat foetuses to alcohol-induced long-term effects on behaviour.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of ethanol (ETOH) with testicular subcellular membranes contributes, at least in part, to alcohol-induced gonadal dysfunction. Vitamin A reaches the testes via the circulation as the retinyl ester and is converted to the free alcohol (retinol) and then to the aldehyde (retinal); retinal is the form of the vitamin which is essential for normal spermato-genesis. Because retinol can function as a free radical scavenger, testicular mitochondria were evaluated for evidence of a protective role provided by supplemental dietary vitamin A on ETOH-induced alterations in testicular structure and function in rats. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measurement of malonaldehyde formation and glutathione content of the testes. Compared to isocalorically matched dextrimaltose-fed controls (ISO) receiving a modified vitamin A containing diet, rats fed the corresponding ETOH diet for 50 days had a reduced testes/body ratio (ETOH: 0.0114 +/- 0.0004 vs ISO: 0.0128 +/- 0.0004). Mitochondrial enriched extracts obtained from the testes of these ETOH-fed rats showed significant increases in malonaldehyde formation; moreover, glutathione levels were reduced in the testes of the alcohol-fed animals when compared to their isocaloric controls. In contrast, no evidence for testicular atrophy was present in ETOH-fed rats receiving a standard vitamin A enriched diet; moreover, such ETOH-fed rats had a reduced rate of malonaldehyde formation as compared to their respective controls. Similarly, glutathione levels were not depleted in the testes of the ETOH-fed rats receiving the vitamin A enriched diet. Taken together, these data suggest that lipid peroxidation is a consequence of ethanol metabolism which can be attenuated, at least in part, by vitamin A.\r"

AA and HD rats consumed high doses while ANA and LD rats preferred low doses of ethanol. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin and growth hormone (GH) concentrations were measured by specific radio-immuno-assays before chronic ethanol administration, during physical dependence and on subsequent withdrawal. Basal TSH levels and TSH responses to cold were as a rule decreased in the course of ethanol intake and abstinence, whereas the TRH-induced TSH elevation became more consistent than before ethanol. There was no difference in basal prolactin levels between ethanol preferring and non-preferring rats at abstinence, whereas 30 min cold-exposure seemed to decrease them in HD and LD rats. The high prolactin levels before ethanol and during physical dependence appear to be caused by stress factors involved in the blood collecting procedure. GH levels were not significantly different in ANA, AA, LD and HD rats and neither ethanol intake nor subsequent withdrawal consistently modified GH levels. It is concluded that the observed minor alterations in the levels of anterior pituitary hormones hardly play any significant role in the development of alcohol dependence.\r"

The breath-ethanol time course was virtually identical after 12 and 36 hr fasting and the peak concentration occurred 30 min after drinking. Fasting for 36 hr caused a 20-fold increase in breath-acetone levels. Under these conditions, i.e. after 12 and 36 hr fasting, the hypoglycemic response to ethanol intake was 10 and 25%, while the antiketogenic response was 38 and 16%, respectively. ADP-induced platelet aggregation and associated TXB2 formation showed wide interindividual variations, but no definite effects of ethanol, hypoglycemia or metabolic acidosis were observed. Platelet function was not significantly influenced by ingestion of a small dose of ethanol after prolonged fasting.\r"

Although the between group comparisons of initial test administration did not indicate a true change in depression, a within group comparison of initial with subsequent test administrations indicated a clear improvement in depression scores on both scales. Apparently the result of the reactive effects of testing, the within group differences could easily mislead a researcher into believing depression was alleviated when in fact it was not. This sizeable testing effect has obvious implications for studies which repeatedly assess depression.\r"

To assess the value of the Trauma Score when used in this way, we compared the change in Trauma Score (TS change) during transport to eventual mortality in a group of injured patients. Patients transported by helicopter to the base hospital during a 22-month period had scores obtained on arrival of the flight crew (TS initial) and again on arrival at the emergency department (TS after transport). Stepwise logistic regression was used to test the predictive power for mortality of TS initial, TS after transport, and TS change. Of 387 patients transferred during the study period, 376 patients had complete information and were included in the analysis. Approximately 75% of patients had no TS change. The best predictor of mortality was TS after transport (F = 80.94, P less than .01). When TS after transport was removed as an explanatory variable, TS initial was found to have significant predictive power for mortality (F = 76.98, P less than .01), with TS change adding significantly to predictive power (F = 15.02, P less than .01). We conclude that because TS change is predictive of survival, it is potentially useful as an outcome measure to evaluate the impact of treatment during transport.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of naloxone, an opiate antagonist, on the adrenomedullary response to cardiac arrest, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured before, during, and after cardiac arrest in dogs. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 12 dogs anesthetized with pentobarital sodium (30 mg/kg) and standard American Heart Association cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was begun using a mechanical device. At 6.5 minutes of CPR, naloxone (10 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (10 ml) was given intravenously. At 12 minutes of CPR, the cardiac ventricles were electrically defibrillated. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were measured before ventricular fibrillation; at 2.5, 4.5, 9.5, and 11.5, minutes of CPR; and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after resuscitation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increased from prearrest levels of 3.66 +/- 0.67 (+/- SE) and 24.02 +/- 3.67 ng/ml to 66.67 +/- 9.65 and 74.00 +/- 9.91 ng/ml, respectively, at 4.5 minutes of CPR. After resuscitation, norepinephrine levels remained slightly elevated, while epinephrine fell to prearrest levels. Naloxone did not cause a significant change in either epinephrine or norepinephrine from 6.5 minutes of CPR (time of treatment) through 20 minutes postresuscitation. In addition, naloxone had no effect on either the end-diastolic pressure difference during CPR or resuscitation outcome. We conclude that cardiac arrest causes significant increases in plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, which remain elevated for the duration of the arrest, and that naloxone has no effect on these levels.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in swine have shown that larger doses of epinephrine than those currently employed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly improve regional myocardial blood flow following prolonged cardiac arrest. The dose-response effect of a pure alpha-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, on regional myocardial blood flow has not been investigated in this setting. This study compared the effect of high-dose epinephrine with graded doses of methoxamine on regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery/utilization, and defibrillation rates during CPR. Twenty swine were instrumented for regional myocardial blood flow measurements using radiolabeled tracer microspheres. Measurements of regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption were made during normal sinus rhythm. Ventricular fibrillation was then induced. Following 10 minutes of ventricular fibrillation, CPR was initiated with a pneumatic compressor. Regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption were then measured during CPR. Following 3 minutes of CPR, the swine were allocated to one of four treatment groups (five per group): group I, epinephrine 0.2 mg/kg; group II, methoxamine 0.1 mg/kg; group III, methoxamine 1.0 mg/kg; and group IV, methoxamine 10.0 mg/kg. One minute after drug administration, regional myocardial blood flow, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption measurements again were made. Three and one half minutes after drug administration, defibrillation was attempted. Regional myocardial blood flow following drug administration was compared using an analysis of covariance. Epinephrine (0.2 mg/kg) significantly improved myocardial blood flow (P less than .002) for all tissues examined compared with all doses of methoxamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Within a single year, UV keratitis from CTFs became the second most common source of corneal burns, injuring 29% of all patients. While most corneal burns resolved with symptomatic treatment, an additional two patients received retinal burns from the CTFs. Both patients were left with permanent visual deficits.

Hair cell counts were obtained at 100-microM intervals throughout the length of the papilla. Significant hair cell loss was documented basally in the 11-day-old chicks, and spread apically over time to maximal loss in the 18-day-old animals. Relative to the control chicks, there was a 36% hair cell loss in these animals. Interestingly, there appears to be a progressive partial recovery of the normal hair cell counts in the 25- and 32-day-old animals.\r"

We tested the horizontal VOR in ten normal subjects during 18 s of active, side-to-side head motion over a frequency range from 2 to 6 Hz. Audible clicks were used as a linearly increasing frequency cue. Head velocity was monitored. The two experimental conditions were head movement while fixating a stationary wall-mounted target in dim light, and head movement in darkness with an imagined stationary target. Computed gain and phase results of the two test conditions were not significantly different, due to inactivation of the smooth pursuit system above 2 Hz. We conclude that higher-frequency VOR responses can be tested in the light by a brief, low-cost test, which does not require expensive rotating machinery.\r"

After unilateral ossicular disarticulation, the animals were given a noise exposure known to cause cochlear damage and vessel transport changes in the stria vascularis. The cochleas with disarticulated ossicular chains received an effective exposure well below one that causes pathologic damage. Only the cochleas with intact ossicular chains showed an increase in the permeability of the strial vessels to horseradish peroxidase tracer and manifested strial edema and organ of Corti damage. These results indicate that the effects of acoustic trauma on cochlear structure and strial vessel transport are induced locally, not systemically. In addition, the minimum time of exposure to 120-dB, 700- to 2800-Hz noise that causes massive cochlear damage in the chinchilla was shown to be between five and ten minutes.\r"

Generally, the configuration of the EMLRs closely resembled the configuration of acoustic MLRs. While in most cases, behavioral thresholds to identical promontory stimulation were slightly lower, EMLR thresholds closely approximated behavioral electrical promontory thresholds. The EMLR thresholds correlated positively with implanted thresholds and exhibited a negative correlation with implanted dynamic current ranges.\r"

The transducer was a 5 X 1.2 X 0.6-mm piezoelectric ceramic bimorph with attached metal holder. Transmission changed with the amount of force holding the transducer tip on the head of the stapes. An optimal connection between the vibrator and stapes produced better transmission than a tight or loose connection. Gluing the connection with cyanoacrylate cement decreased transmission in the optimal connection, produced no change in the tight connection, and improved transmission in the loose connection. Comparison of stapes displacement produced by the vibrator at 1 kHz with that produced by normal middle-ear sound transmission revealed that the vibrator-induced stapes displacement for a 1 V peak-to-peak input was equivalent to that produced by a sound stimulus of 90-dB sound pressure level at the tympanic membrane.\r"

Ten (77%) of 13 histologically normal samples, and four (80%) of five tumor samples obtained from male patients contained ER by this criterion, as did five (83%) of six normal samples and eight (88%) of nine tumor samples obtained from female patients. Mean ER concentrations plus or minus SE in male-derived samples were 2.02 +/- .42 fmol/mg of cytosol protein for normal tissue and 4.35 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg of cytosol protein for tumor tissue; mean ER concentrations in female-derived samples were 3.48 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg of cytosol protein for normal tissue and 12.64 +/- 6.4 fmol/mg of cytosol protein for tumor tissue.

These elevations usually occurred in the first two postoperative hours and lasted approximately nine hours. Six patients required interventional therapy (intravenous nitroglycerin or sodium nitroprusside). No cardiac or central nervous system sequelae resulted, but two patients had postoperative hemorrhage and flap elevation by hematoma attributed to the hypertension. Carotid sinus denervation during radical neck dissection may be the cause of the reflex hypertension once general anesthesia-induced vasodilation has ended. Stripping of tumor from the carotid artery or placement of dermis grafts directly on the artery do not appear to influence postoperative development of hypertension.\r"

Previous animal experimentation has demonstrated that BIOCEM can establish and maintain direct contact with bone without compromising tissue vitality. Rather, it favors with time the ingrowth of, and coverage by, newly formed bone, thus creating interdigitations and strong fixation of the implant. This novel technique has now, for the first time, successfully been applied in humans, ie, for the fixation of frontal sinuses. Clinical, radiological, and histological findings are briefly reported, and it is also shown that the frontal sinus mucosa had recovered at the inside of the lesions filled with BIOCEM.\r"

Of 343 surviving neonates, five (1.5%) developed clinically significant subglottic stenosis. The conclusion of this study is that endotracheal intubation is a safe method of airway management in neonates, even when used for extended periods.\r"

Ninety-eight ferrets were used in these experiments, which were undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of steroids and/or a long-acting vasoconstrictor, to develop dose-response curves for dexamethasone sodium phosphate if it proved efficacious, and to evaluate the possible synergistic effects of combination therapy. With this animal model, we were able to document a statistically significant early effect of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, but only when administered in large doses (greater than 0.5 mg/kg). Our data also support the tapering of these large doses within a 20-hour period. The long-acting vasoconstrictor oxymetazoline hydrochloride has a clear and statistically significant beneficial effect that is apparent by 20 hours and continues through 40 hours. We did not find any additive or synergistic effect of the combination of dexamethasone and oxymetazoline. Further studies are underway in our laboratory to elucidate other aspects of this interesting syndrome.\r"

Over 80% of the patients improved on at least one of these factors following surgery. However, postoperative intercorrelations among these three variables were relatively low. Furthermore, preoperative indexes of apnea severity could not be used to predict the degree of postoperative improvement.\r"

Thus, the thermal effects generated within the larynx (final temperature, 34.9 degrees C to 37.1 degrees C) should be insufficient to act alone in achieving a therapeutic response in either tumor tissue or destruction of normal epithelium.\r"

The DMSO was given intraperitoneally at a dose of 1.5 g/kg. On each rat, an abdominal island flap (3 X 6 cm) was raised and restored to its original site. Laser Doppler velocimetry and perfusion fluorometry were used to monitor flap perfusion immediately following surgery (day 0) and on postoperative day 3. Flap survival was significantly greater in the DMSO-treated groups when compared with the control group. Significant increases in blood perfusion were noted in the treated flaps on day 3.\r"

A technique has been developed for toluidine blue staining of the esophagus during panendoscopy. In this initial series of 18 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract, we found a 17% incidence of early carcinoma of the esophagus.

Direct driving of the stapes by an ossicular vibrator of piezoelectric ceramic bimorph is the fundamental mechanism of this device. Acoustic signals received by a microphone were transmitted to the external link coil after amplification. By means of electromagnetic induction, the internal coil placed under the retroauricular skin excited electroacoustic energy, which is transmitted to the vibrator directly coupled with the stapes. The device used in this first patient has been functioning for longer than one year. Excellent frequency response of the vibrator and highly efficient direct transmission of electroacoustic signals to the inner ear gave rise to acoustic perception of superior quality that could not be obtained by other surgical or rehabilitative measures.\r"

The forearm free flap for intraoral defects can provide thin and pliable skin and has great potential in the reconstruction of oropharyngeal defects.

The slope was compared with indices of myocardial scarring or cardiac enlargement derived from x ray and echocardiographic and angio-cardiographic investigations. In 35 (67%) patients the slope failed to predict the severity of myocardial ischaemia attributable to coronary artery narrowing: in 14 (27%) patients the slope overestimated the findings of coronary angiography and in 21 (40%) patients the slope underestimated the findings of coronary angiography. In the remaining 17 (33%) patients the slope accorded with the assessment of myocardial ischaemia by coronary angiography. Underestimation by the slope was associated with significantly poorer left ventricular function and a lower ejection fraction, indicating a greater degree of myocardial scarring. To assess whether overestimation was related to cardiac enlargement with better preservation of ventricular function a follow up examination was performed six months after infarction. In the overestimated group 11 patients were followed up and seven of them showed a reduction in the maximal ST/HR slope which correlated with a reduction in the cardiothoracic ratio. This suggested that cardiac enlargement had contributed to myocardial ischaemia. The results suggest that if the maximal ST/HR slope is an index of exercise induced myocardial ischaemia after recent infarction, it is subject to the influences of coronary artery narrowing as well as those of scarring and cardiac enlargement.\r"

In 36 of these the data were obtained in all four sites. The maximum and mean velocities were calculated for each valve and these values were plotted against gestational age. There was little change in these values throughout pregnancy. The orifice dimensions of the valves were measured by cross sectional echocardiography. At all ages the tricuspid orifice was larger than the mitral and the pulmonary orifice was larger than the aortic. The blood flow values for each valve were derived from the product of the mean velocity and the valve orifice dimensions. The output of the right ventricle was usually, but not always, greater than that of the left ventricle. Combined ventricular output increased from approximately 50 ml/min at 18 weeks to 1200 ml/min at term. Despite limitations in the accuracy of the technique these results form a useful basis for the analysis of blood flow in the normal fetus and for the interpretation of abnormal Doppler findings in prenatal life.\r"

  ".W": "The enzyme beta-enolase (alpha beta and beta beta forms) is present in skeletal and heart muscle and catalyses the glycolysis of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The enzyme was measured in serum samples from patients with acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, and idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Serum concentrations of beta-enolase were significantly increased in acute myocardial infarction but not in the other cardiovascular diseases. Activity peaked approximately 12 to 14 hours after an acute attack of chest pain, and then gradually decreased as the patient recovered. The rise and fall in beta-enolase concentration were faster and steeper than those of creatine kinase activity, particularly in patients in whom activities of both these enzymes were less high. The assay of beta-enolase, which is highly specific and sensitive, has considerable advantages for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction and the diagnosis of a second episode of myocardial infarction because beta-enolase concentration increases very early and rapidly and clears quickly. These data imply that serum beta-enolase may be a more effective marker for early myocardial infarction, particularly in milder cases, than measurement of creatine kinase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmia is common after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Such arrhythmia could be caused by damage at surgical repair or it could be part of the course of the disease. Fifty patients, 32 aged 1-7 years and 18 aged 13-43 years at surgical repair, underwent 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring before and 2-75 (mean 44) months after repair. Before operation none of the younger group had appreciable ventricular arrhythmia, whereas ventricular arrhythmia was already present in eight (45%) of 18 patients in the older group. At follow up ventricular arrhythmia was present in four patients from the younger group and seven from the older group. Three of these four younger patients had had insertion of a conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery or reoperation. Six of the seven older patients had had appreciable ventricular arrhythmia before operation. New ventricular arrhythmia developed in only two (5%) of the 43 patients who had uncomplicated repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Thus the high frequency of ventricular arrhythmia after repair of tetralogy of Fallot cannot be attributed to the effect of operation alone because in the majority of patients it was already present before operation. Preoperative ventricular arrhythmia occurred almost exclusively in older patients; this suggests that early surgery may reduce the occurrence of this late complication.\r"

The results were compared with those of computed tomography, aortography, and with findings at operation or necropsy or both. Transthoracic echocardiography identified three of the four patients with type I dissection, two of the five patients with type II dissection, and one of the 12 patients with type III dissection. When transoesophageal echocardiography was used as well the degree of aortic dissection was identified correctly in all 21 patients. In one patient with type I and in eight patients with type III dissection spontaneous echocardiographic contrast with a mural thrombus within the false lumen could be detected. Computed tomography was unable to demonstrate an intimal flap in one of two patients studied with type I dissection, in two of three patients with type II dissection, and in one of nine patients with type III dissection. Aortography was negative in one of two patients studied with type I dissection, two of four patients with type II dissection, and in one of eight patients with type II dissection. The whole thoracic aorta can be imaged by a combination of transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography. The addition of transoesophageal echocardiography to transthoracic echocardiography improves the recognition of aortic dissection. Furthermore, this examination can be performed at the bedside and the findings can be used as a basis for treatment.\r"

Until recently it has been impossible to detect without an angiographic study of the left ventricle. A combination of cross sectional and Doppler ultrasound studies led to the correct diagnosis in two patients with left ventricular pseudoaneurysms after mitral valve replacement. Cross sectional echocardiography showed a posterolateral echo-free space confined only by the pericardium and communicating with the left ventricle through a defect in the ventricular wall, and Doppler echocardiography confirmed the presence of blood flow in this cavity. This Doppler finding is critical if the perforation is too small to be identified reliably by cross sectional imaging. Surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm can be undertaken without invasive studies if the echocardiographic findings are unequivocal and there is no reason to suspect the integrity of the circumflex coronary artery.\r"

There were 26 episodes in 24 patients who had been treated surgically (operated group) (16 open and eight closed cardiac operations). Endocarditis occurred soon after open heart surgery in eight patients and as a late complication in the other 16. It recurred in two patients (operated group). Invasive monitoring and low cardiac output were consistent features in those patients who had endocarditis soon after open heart surgery whereas dental treatment was a common feature in non-operated cases and after closed cardiac operations. Late cases of endocarditis after open heart surgery had various microbiological features that were not typical of infection after dental problems. Gram positive infections occurred in non-operated patients and in those who had had closed cardiac operations. The group that had open heart surgery had infections caused by Gram positive, Gram negative, and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. Fever, anaemia, leucocytosis, and positive blood cultures were the only consistent findings. Vegetations were seen in nine of 12 patients at cross sectional echocardiography. All 12 (four non-operated, one closed, and seven open cases) needed acute surgical treatment. The mortality from infective endocarditis was 17% for non-operated cases, 0% for those who had had closed heart surgery, and 50% for those who had had open heart surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty nine cases that presented from 1971 to 1980 were compared with 21 cases that presented from 1981 to 1985. Apart from an appreciable decrease in the frequency of neurological complications between the first period (38%) and the second period (10%) no differences in clinical or bacteriological features were seen. Seventeen (59%) of the 29 cases in the earlier period and four (19%) of the 21 cases in the later period died. The rationale for antimicrobial treatment was similar during both periods. Cardiac surgery was performed in eight of 29 cases between 1971 and 1980 and in 11 of 21 between 1981 and 1985; the mean (SD) time between diagnosis of endocarditis and operation was 28 (19) days and 43 (44) days respectively. Six of the eight cases operated on in the first period died as did two of the 11 operated on in the second period. Twenty seven of the 29 cases presenting between 1971 and 1980 were treated with anticoagulants--either warfarin (15 of 27) or heparin sodium (12 of 27). Sixteen of the 21 cases presenting later were given anticoagulants and 15 of these cases were given heparin sodium. Control of anticoagulation was inadequate in nine of the 27 cases treated with anticoagulants during the first period and in only two of 16 treated during the second period. During the first treatment period neurological complications were more frequent when control of anticoagulation was inadequate.\r"

There were 12 cases of early and 46 cases of late prosthetic valve endocarditis. These developed in 28 patients with an isolated aortic valve, in 26 with an isolated mitral valve, and in four with both aortic and mitral prosthetic valves. Streptococci were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, followed by staphylococci, Gram negative bacteria, and fungi. A surgical (34 cases) or a necropsy specimen (10 cases) from 44 cases was examined. Eighty two per cent of the patients had congestive heart failure. Twenty four of the 58 patients were medically treated and 17 died (70% mortality). Combined medical and surgical treatment was used in 34 patients; the main indication for surgery was congestive heart failure. Fourteen patients on combined treatment died (40% mortality). Persistent sepsis and prosthetic valve dehiscence were the most common early and late operative complications. The most important influences on outcome were congestive heart failure, the type of micro-organism, the severity and extent of anatomical lesions, the time of onset of prosthetic valve endocarditis, and the type of treatment. This survey indicates that only patients without congestive heart failure or embolic complications and with sensitive micro-organism should be treated medically. In view of the poor prognosis patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis associated with congestive heart failure, persistent sepsis, and repeat arterial emboli should be treated by early surgical intervention.\r"

The right ventricular ejection fraction did not differ significantly between the groups, but left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly depressed after anterior myocardial infarction. There was evidence of right ventricular dilatation and impaired transit in the group with inferior infarction. Five patients with anterior infarction and six with inferior infarction had abnormal right ventricular ejection fractions. Right ventricular wall motion abnormalities affected the septal wall in the group with anterior infarction and the free wall in the group with inferior infarction. The relation between right and left ventricular ejection fractions was markedly different in the two groups. In the group with anterior infarction there was a significant linear relation between right and left ventricular ejection fraction, whereas in the group with inferior infarction there was not. Thus right ventricular dysfunction commonly occurs after both anterior and inferior myocardial infarction. Right and left ventricular impairment are related after anterior myocardial infarction, but are independent after inferior myocardial infarction. Finally, the different effects of anterior and inferior myocardial infarction on right ventricular function may be explained by differences in septal and free wall involvement.\r"

Recordings were obtained during a total of 24 balloon occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery varying in duration from 5 to 45 s. Continuous 12 lead surface electrocardiograms were recorded. During or after balloon inflation of greater than or equal to 12 s (n = 4) there was no change in coronary sinus pH or the electrocardiogram. During balloon inflation of greater than or equal to 15 s (n = 20) coronary sinus pH was unaltered but between 4 and 6 s after balloon deflation coronary sinus pH fell transiently by between 0.010 and 0.120 pH units before returning to the control value within 65 s. Ischaemic changes were seen on the electrocardiogram during 15 balloon occlusions. In individual patients the peak fall in coronary sinus pH was related to the duration of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A rise in coronary sinus pH (alkalosis) was never seen. In man acidosis occurs in the myocardium after short periods (greater than or equal to 12 s) of ischaemia. The fall of pH precedes ischaemic changes on the surface electrocardiogram and occurs concurrently with the earliest reported changes in contractile function.\r"

All underwent exercise electrocardiography to symptom limitation according to the Bruce protocol (first effort), and exercise to the onset of angina (warm up) followed by four minutes' rest, followed by exercise to symptom limitation (second effort). This protocol was repeated after sequential treatment for one month each with nifedipine 10 mg three times a day and with timolol 10 mg twice a day. Warm up significantly increased walking time to the onset of angina by 34.5% and to maximal exercise by 29.5%. The heart rate and rate-pressure product were significantly higher on second effort both at the onset of angina (by 7.0% and 11.1% respectively) and at maximal exercise (by 10.5% and 15.4% respectively). ST segment displacement was not significantly different after warm up. The effect of warm up on walking time to the onset of angina was markedly reduced after treatment with nifedipine but little influenced by timolol. Mean (SE) walking time after warm up on no treatment was 10.1 (0.7) min; after treatment with nifedipine it was 10.0 (0.6) min and after treatment with timolol it was 9.7 (0.4) min. These data demonstrate a substantial improvement in exercise performance after warm up and are consistent with the hypothesis that submaximal exercise in angina pectoris facilitates myocardial oxygen uptake by coronary vasodilatation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of respiration on systolic and diastolic time intervals, simultaneous phonocardiograms, carotid pulse tracings, M mode echocardiograms, and respiratory curve tracings were measured in 25 healthy subjects. The positioning of each cardiac cycle in relation to the phase of respiration was assessed and the dependency of heart rate and cardiac time intervals on respiration was examined. Heart rate clearly varied over the respiratory cycle. Where necessary the time intervals were corrected for heart rate or RR interval. The systolic time intervals showed a stronger dependency on respiratory group than the diastolic time intervals. The decrease in left ventricular ejection time and increase in pre-ejection period and isovolumic contraction time during inspiration support the idea that a relative increase in afterload in inspiration determines left ventricular systolic function. Isovolumic relaxation time also showed cyclic behaviour whereas the left ventricular filling time was affected by inspiration only. Filling time increased significantly when there was a transition from expiration to inspiration during left ventricular ejection. It seems that when isovolumic contraction takes place in expiration the diastolic intervals of this cycle take on an expiratory character. The increase in filling can be viewed as a compensatory effect that partly offsets the loss of stroke volume during inspiration.\r"

The peak systolic transvalvar pressure gradient was significantly reduced from a mean (SD) of 104(30) to 24.3(6) mm Hg. This haemodynamic improvement was maintained at six week follow up. In six patients pulmonary infundibular spasm developed immediately after valvotomy; however, these patients showed considerable haemodynamic improvement at the six week follow up. During balloon inflation the heart rate did not fall below 60 beats/minute and the systemic aortic pressure was maintained above 90 mm Hg. Early results indicate that percutaneous double balloon valvotomy in adults is an effective treatment for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis. Theoretically the two balloons provide a venting area during inflation. This has the advantage of preventing bradycardia or systemic hypotension during prolonged balloon inflation.\r"

  ".W": "Three patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis were treated with percutaneous mitral valvotomy. A Brockenbrough catheter was advanced transseptally into the left atrium and then into the left ventricle over a long guide wire. An angle wire loop retriever was advanced through a 10 Fr straight catheter via the femoral artery into the left ventricle. The retriever was used to catch the flexible end of the long guide wire. This end of the long guide wire was then drawn out of the right femoral artery by the retriever through the straight catheter. The straight catheter was left in the descending aorta; the Brockenbrough catheter was removed and a 7 Fr balloon catheter was introduced percutaneously over the long guide wire through the femoral vein. This balloon catheter was used for interatrial septal dilatation and right femoral venous dilatation. In two patients this catheter was replaced over the long guide wire with a 9 Fr Schneider-Medintag Gruntzig catheter (3 X 12 mm diameter when inflated) and in the other by a Mansfield (18 mm diameter when inflated). The procedure was well tolerated in these three patients and there were no complications. Haemodynamic function improved, there was appreciable decrease in dyspnoea, and exercise tolerance was increased. This procedure has several advantages: the balloon is more easily positioned through the mitral valve; the stability of the balloon during inflation is improved by traction at both ends of the long guide wire; and there is the option of rapidly exchanging one balloon for a larger one over the long guide wire.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arrhythmias were common, occurring at some time in 16/18 (89%). Arrhythmia was serious in four; two of them required pacing and two had cardiac arrests, one resulting in death. Seven (41%) had right ventricular dysfunction; this was progressive in three. Tricuspid regurgitation was present in seven (41%); it occurred in patients with normal and reduced right ventricular ejection fractions. Regurgitation became progressively worse as the right ventricle dilated. Left ventricular function was well preserved in most patients. Fourteen (82%) of this pioneer group were leading normal lives (ability index 1 or 2). Although these results are acceptable concern remains about the probability of deteriorating right ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of ventricular tachycardia by ventricular stimulation was investigated in 46 patients with isolated Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (10 concealed) and 36 control patients with normal electrocardiograms and conduction systems. None of those studied had spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial or valve disease. Single and double ventricular extrastimuli were delivered at 3 cycle lengths (sinus, 600 ms, 400 ms). In the controls ventricular simulation induced one episode (3%) of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular stimulation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome induced two episodes of ventricular fibrillation and 15 episodes of non-sustained multiform ventricular tachycardia (37%). Ventricular arrhythmias were induced only in patients with overt Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In 14 patients the conformation of the electrocardiogram at the start of ventricular tachycardia resembled that of major pre-excitation. The absence of inducible ventricular tachycardia in patients with concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome suggests that anterograde conduction via an atrioventricular accessory pathway is required to initiate the ventricular arrhythmias: the ventricular tachycardia may be associated with reentry of impulses via atrioventricular connection during the phase of ventricular vulnerability. The similarity between the start of ventricular tachycardia and pre-excitatory complexes may also indicate local reentry into the ventricular area occupied by the bypass tracts. Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and anterograde pre-excitation are more likely to have inducible multiform ventricular tachycardia than individuals without Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

While this has occurred at a time of increasing questioning of doctors' decisions, in New Zealand there has been the added dimension of a major change in the law related to personal injury. Under the provisions of the Accident Compensation Act there are no grounds for a civil action against a doctor in respect of a medical misadventure. The only provision for recompense is through the Accident Compensation Corporation. With the removal of the punitive aspect of civil actions against doctors, there has been an increase in complaints through other channels. The anaesthetist is particularly vulnerable because of the immediacy with which an adverse event is likely to cause obvious harm to a patient. This can only be countered by high standards of practice, together with careful record keeping.\r"

Trolox-C, a water-soluble analogue of vitamin E, incorporated in the pre-irradiation growth medium or in the post-irradiation plating medium, protected the actinic reticuloid cells to the extent that they were as resistant as normal cells.

The mean density of NK cells in malignant melanoma (5.0 +/- 1.5 X 10(3)/mm3) and in squamous cell carcinoma (5.1 +/- 2.7 X 10(3)/mm3) was significantly lower than in germinal centres of normal human tonsils (5.0 +/- 0.8 X 10(4)/mm3). The NK cell/tumour cell ratio (0.03 +/- 0.015 in malignant melanoma and 0.02 +/- 0.015 in squamous cell carcinoma) is 10(2)-10(4) times lower than that commonly used for in vitro assays. The possible role of NK cells in malignant skin tumours should be viewed with caution.\r"

Initially, the total serum IgE concentration and the concentration of IgE antibody to house dust mite were very high. These concentrations decreased over the next 3 years, following amelioration of her eczema. However, they rose again when her eczema worsened as a result of marital problems and fell once again with amelioration of her eczema after separation from her husband. The IgE concentrations to other common allergens, however, remained stable during this period. These results suggest that large amounts of house dust mite antigen may be scratched into the skin during clinical exacerbations of the eczema, this in turn aggravating the state of the skin because of hypersensitivity to the mite.\r"

UAI increased significantly with time, even in women not given oxytocin. UAI increased logarithmically with increasing oxytocin infusion rate. Levels of uterine activity before and after oxytocin infusion are correlated positively such that the higher the initial level of UAI the higher the UAI in response to oxytocin. However, the regression line approaches the line of identity such that even with high doses of oxytocin UAI would not be likely to exceed 2500 kPas/15 min. There is a positive correlation between uterine activity and cervical dilatation rate in unstimulated labour; however, this is less evident following oxytocin infusion. Increases in uterine activity below 1200 kPas/15 min result from both higher frequency and active pressure, whereas above 1200 kPas/15 min any increase is due mainly to a rise in frequency.\r"

After treatment with monophasic cyproterone acetate and biphasic desogestrel, the cholesterol and phospholipid contents of the HDL-2 fraction were significantly higher than those found after treatment with the other preparations. The lowest values were found after treatment with monophasic levonorgestrel, whereas monophasic desogestrel, triphasic levonorgestrel, monophasic norethisterone and triphasic gestoden induced intermediate values for these variables.

  ".U": "87299569\r", 
  ".W": "This paper reports the preliminary results of a cohort study of 4544 British women receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). These women were recruited at 21 specialist menopause clinics around Britain. Up to the end of June 1983, the mean duration of HRT use per woman was 67 months of which, on average, 43% was 'opposed' use. In general, however, both the amount of progestogen given and the number of days per cycle for which it was given was less than would have been the case if the women had been receiving modern opposed therapy. The major focus of the study was to monitor mortality and cancer incidence in the cohort. The mortality results were broadly reassuring: overall mortality was significantly lower than expected on the basis of national rates (relative risk 0.58) and mortality ratios were below unity for all specific causes of death examined apart from cancer of the ovary (relative risk 1.43, 95% confidence limits 0.62-2.82) and suicide or suspected suicide (relative risk 2.53, 95% confidence limits 1.26-4.54). The most likely explanation for the latter finding is selection bias--thus at least 7 of the 11 women who died from suicide or suspected suicide had a psychiatric history before receiving HRT. The cancer incidence results were less reassuring, although they should be interpreted with some caution because cancer registry rates were used for comparative purposes. With this proviso, endometrial cancer risk was significantly elevated (relative risk 2.84, 95% confidence limits 1.46-4.96); many of the women concerned had taken therapy which was predominantly or entirely opposed although only one woman had received an opposed regimen which would now be considered adequately protective to the endometrium. Breast cancer incidence was also significantly increased (relative risk 1.59, 95% confidence limits 1.18-2.10); detailed analysis suggested that the use of unopposed ethinyl-oestradiol in particular might have undesirable effects on the breast.\r"

These observations may serve to alert the clinician to the increased risk of these complications when dealing with women who have a history of recurrent miscarriage.\r"

Eleven fetuses (3.2%) with a heart rate variation less than the 5th centile were identified, of whom 10 were studied longitudinally. At 30-33 weeks the mean minute range of pulse intervals (a measure of fetal heart rate variation) was 31.4 (SE 1.5) ms compared with 51.0 (SE 3.4) ms in a randomly selected control group. The study group continued to have significantly lower fetal heart rate variation than controls on each of three subsequent occasions until delivery. There were no significant differences between the two groups in fetal outcome, which was good. This demonstrates that a small proportion of normal fetuses have consistently low heart rate variation, and helps to define the lower limit of the normal distribution of fetal heart rate variation. After delivery, there were no significant differences between heart rate or its variation between the two groups. We conclude that the lower prenatal heart rate variation in the study group was a consequence of the uterine environment.\r"

Both cotinine levels and smoking history were significantly associated with reduced birthweight, but cotinine correlated significantly better. Smokers of greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes per day, representing the 2.7% of women with the greatest cigarette consumption, had infants 289 g lighter than the 68% of women who were nonsmokers. Women with serum cotinine levels in the top 2.7% (greater than or equal to 284 ng/ml) had infants 441 g lighter than the 68% of women with the lowest cotinine levels (less than or equal to 24 ng/ml). Our results strengthen the evidence linking smoking with low birthweight and also demonstrate that cotinine can be satisfactorily used to assess and monitor cigarette smoking in pregnancy.\r"

The present study compares the refraction of a group of 100 British patients at the time of first presentation with cataract in whom the refraction was also known four years previously, with a group of matched controls in whom the refraction was also known four years previous to presentation. The study shows that simple myopia does not appear to predispose to cataract. It is the development of the cataract itself, in particular nuclear sclerosis, which causes the refractive change towards myopia. The myopic change precedes the development of cataract, and patients over the age of 55 showing a myopic change in refraction have a very high probability of developing nuclear sclerotic cataract. The healthy aging eye and eyes with cortical cataract or subcapsular cataract, but without nuclear sclerosis, continue to show a gradual hypermetropic change with time.\r"

We report here such a case with bilateral Mooren's ulcer that failed to respond to local therapy with topical corticosteroids, silver nitrate, and conjunctival resection, as well as systemic immunosuppression with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. Systemic cyclosporin (10 mg/kg/day) resulted in resolution of the corneal ulceration within two weeks of beginning treatment, and the patient has remained in remission after 15 months of therapy. Cyclosporin side effects included hirsutism, hypertension, increased blood levels of urea and creatinine, and abnormalities in liver function tests. All these resolved on reducing the dosage of cyclosporin. The results in this case suggest that cyclosporin is an effective agent in patients with severe sight threatening Mooren's ulcer.\r"

Most of the information on visual field progression was contained in the scotoma mass. When both scotoma mass and foveal sensitivity were known, central or peripheral isoptres did not add statistically significant information on progression. Evaluation of scotomas and assessment of central isoptres or of foveal sensitivity made perimetry of the peripheral isoptres redundant. The appearance of fresh peripheral scotomas or the quantification of changes in peripheral scotomas was not examined in the current study, and they would of course be important when they occurred.\r"

The water and nitrogen contents of the stored cornea were compared with those of the fresh cornea. The medium was analysed before and after corneal storage to determine the concentrations of glucose, protein, and amino acids as well as pH and osmolarity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to estimate the degree of the corneal endothelial cell damage. The nitrogen contents and dry weights of the steroid treated and untreated stored corneas were similar to those of the fresh unstored cornea. The steroid treated cornea contained a lesser amount of water than the untreated cornea. The cornea stored in medium without steroid took up a greater amount of glucose from the medium than the cornea stored in medium with steroid. As compared with their concentrations in the fresh unused medium the concentrations of leucine, lysine, and glycine were lower and that of glutamic acid was higher in both the media used for corneal storage. However, the steroid treated storage medium as compared with the untreated storage medium had a greater reduction in the lowering of leucine, lysine, and glycine, and a lesser reduction in the increase of glutamic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diagnosis of SPD was made on basis of a prolonged bleeding time, a decreased total platelet ADP, and a diminished level of serotonin. Fifty-one patients from 34 unrelated families had congenital SPD, and 55 patients had acquired SPD. Congenital SPD was a common disorder in patients with a lifelong bleeding tendency and a prolonged bleeding time. The frequency in this group of patients was 18%, about one-half the frequency of von Willebrand's disease (vWd). Twenty-three percent of all patients had normal aggregation responses to ADP, epinephrine, and collagen; 33% had aggregation tracings typical for a secretion defect; and 44% had miscellaneous aggregation abnormalities. These findings indicate that SPD is common, heterogeneous, and not necessarily associated with in vitro aggregation abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Close platelet-to-platelet contact induced by weak agonists in a medium with a low concentration of Ca2+ leads to thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation, release of granule contents, and secondary aggregation. These responses do not occur in a medium containing Ca2+ in the physiological range (1 to 2 mmol/L). Experiments were done to determine whether feedback amplification is required to generate amounts of TXA2 that are sufficient to cause secondary aggregation and the reactions associated with it, or whether close platelet-to-platelet contact alone is sufficient to generate enough TXA2 to produce these responses. Platelets were washed and resuspended in a modified Tyrode solution to which no calcium salt was added that contained 0.35% albumin and apyrase. This medium contains 20 mumol/L Ca2+ and 1 mmol/L Mg2+. Platelets were aggregated with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the presence of fibrinogen, agglutinated with polylysine, or after pretreatment with chymotrypsin, aggregated with fibrinogen. In the low-Ca2+ medium, all these agonists caused platelets to adhere to each other, followed by secondary aggregation with TXA2 formation and release of granule contents. When Ca2+ (1 to 2 mmol/L), aspirin, or the thromboxane receptor blocker BM 13.177 was present, the secondary responses did not occur; dazoxiben decreased thromboxane formation, but did not prevent secondary aggregation or release. Aspirin-treated platelets were less responsive to ADP, U46619, or TXA2 in the low-Ca2+ medium, which indicated that the secondary responses of untreated platelets were not caused by a generalized increase in sensitivity. The reactions that result from close platelet-to-platelet contact in a low-Ca2+ medium can be caused by a wide variety of weak agonists; the secondary aggregation response and release of granule contents are dependent on TXA2 formation and on feedback amplification by TXA2 or the prostaglandin endoperoxides. The secondary responses caused by weak agonists in citrated platelet-rich plasma (which has a concentration of Ca2+ similar to the low-Ca2+ medium used in the present studies) do not occur at the concentration of Ca2+ in circulating blood and thus may have little biologic relevance.\r"

The vascular TG had several properties that were similar but not identical to guinea pig liver TG. Both enzymes had similar chromatographic and electrophoretic properties, preferentially cross-linked the alpha-chains of fibrinogen, and reacted with polyclonal and monoclonal anti-guinea-pig liver TG antibodies. However, the TG from adult bovine aortic endothelial (ABAE) cells exhibited a novel Ca2+/Mg2+ dependence for enzymatic activity that was distinct from that of purified guinea pig liver TG. The mol wt of the vascular TG (79 +/- 3 kd) determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was slightly lower than the purified guinea pig liver TG (85 +/- 9 kd). The TG antigen was detected by immunohistochemical techniques in association with the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of arteries, veins, venules, and capillaries. The TG antigen also codistributed with the fibronectin antigen along the hepatic sinusoids. The ABAE cell TG cross-linked alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor to fibrinogen and caused the modified fibrinogen to be 40-fold more resistant to plasminolysis. A thrombin-independent TG in vascular cells of blood vessels could provide an alternate pathway to inhibit fibrinolysis and promote fibrin stabilization.\r"

  ".W": "Erythrocytes and progenitor-derived erythroblasts of sickle cell anemia patients from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia contain increased fetal hemoglobin and G gamma globin. A distinctive DNA polymorphism haplotype in the beta globin gene cluster (++- +-), tightly coupled to a C----T substitution at position -158 5' to the cap site of the G gamma globin gene, is strongly associated with sickle cell disease in this region. To determine whether the increased fetal hemoglobin production and/or elevated G gamma globin content are tightly linked to this haplotype, we studied 55 members of five Saudi families in which sickle cell disease is present. The results did not suggest a tight linkage of the haplotype to increased fetal hemoglobin production. On the other hand, several sickle trait family members heterozygous for the haplotype had normal fetal hemoglobin production in culture but elevated G gamma to A gamma ratios in peripheral blood. This observation suggests that in this genetic background increased expression of the G gamma globin gene may occur without a measurable increase in total fetal hemoglobin production. The family studies also clearly demonstrate that increased fetal hemoglobin production by erythroid progenitors is dependent on zygosity for the sickle gene in this population. These findings strongly suggest that other factors, such as the products of genes stimulated by hemolytic stress or other genetic determinants associated with the Saudi beta S chromosome, may interact with the -158 C----T substitution and influence gamma globin gene expression in this population.\r"

We examined the effect of FSBA and pCMBS on ADP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i using platelets loaded with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators quin2 and fura-2. FSBA (50 to 200 mumol/L) induced a dose-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i, indicating that it is a weak platelet agonist. Under conditions of covalent labeling of the ADP binding sites, FSBA (50 to 100 mumol/L) did not inhibit the ADP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i or its inhibition of adenylate cyclase, whereas pCMBS (up to 1 mmol/L) abolished both these responses but not shape change.

  ".W": "The clinical severity of common hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) is highly variable, ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to a severe hemolytic anemia. To elucidate the molecular basis of this variable clinical expression, we evaluated 56 subjects from 24 HE kindred, who carry alpha spectrin mutants characterized by a spectrin dimer (SpD) self-association defect related to a structural abnormality of the alpha I domain of spectrin. Twenty-nine subjects had common HE, 13 subjects have a closely related disorder, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), and 14 are asymptomatic carriers. We compared the severity of hemolysis with the following biochemical parameters: (a) spectrin heterodimer self-association, as manifested by the percentage of SpD in the 4 degrees C low ionic strength spectrin extract; (b) spectrin structure, as examined by limited tryptic digestion of spectrin; and (c) spectrin content of the RBC membrane. Our analysis indicates that the severity of hemolysis may be correlated with quantitative differences in the percentage of SpD in the 4 degrees C spectrin extract, as well as the total spectrin content of the membrane. Thus, HPP subjects, who have the most severe hemolytic anemia, have the highest percentage of SpD as well as a decreased spectrin content. HE subjects and asymptomatic carriers, respectively, have a lower percentage of SpD and a normal spectrin content. Factors influencing these two determinants include functional differences between the individual spectrin mutants, the relative amounts of mutant spectrin present in the cells, the stability of mutant spectrin, and the possibility of a superimposed genetic defect involving spectrin synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "87300151\r", 
  ".W": "Previous reports have indicated that the nucleotide affinity analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl adenosine (FSBA) at concentrations between 40 and 100 mumol/L and at times greater than 20 minutes covalently modifies a single protein component on the external platelet membrane surface and that adenosine diphosphate (ADP) protects against this reaction. That this protein is an ADP receptor linked to platelet activation is shown by FSBA inhibition of ADP-mediated platelet shape change, aggregation, and fibrinogen receptor exposure. In this report, further evidence for the interaction of FSBA with the ADP receptor on platelets is provided by the observation that FSBA at high concentrations (100 to 500 mumol/L) behaves as a weak agonist to produce platelet shape change within one minute as detected by spectroscopic assay and scanning electron microscopy with concomitant phosphorylation of the light chain of platelet myosin. The specificity of FSBA as an agonist is demonstrated by inhibition of FSBA-induced shape change by ATP and the covalent incorporation of SBA as well as the failure of 5'-fluorosulfonylbenozoyl guanosine (FSBG) to cause shape change. In contrast, incubation of platelets with low concentrations of [3H]-FSBA (40 mol/L) is not associated with stimulation of platelet shape change or myosin light chain phosphorylation.\r"

Elevation of the total calcium content was observed in the cells from all patients, particularly in CC and splenectomized beta-thal. However, [Ca]i was within the normal range (approximately 25 nmol/L) in all the pathologic cells. Ca2+ influx in CC cells and in cells from nonsplenectomized beta-thal patients was also within the same range as that observed in control erythrocytes. In cells from splenectomized beta-thal patients, the kinetic of 45Ca influx was biphasic, indicating the existence of two pools of exchangeable Ca2+. Density fractionation of the cells from one splenectomized beta-thal patient showed that the rapid pool corresponded to the lightest cell fraction, which was also found to have the highest calcium content. The dense cells exhibited a normal Ca2+ influx as well as a smaller increase in total calcium content. It is suggested that, as in sickle cell anemia, the excess of Ca2+ in beta-thal cells is not free in the cytoplasm but trapped within endocytic vacuoles, especially in a population of abnormal cells that are normally removed by the spleen. In CC patients, who have a functional spleen, a different mechanism could be responsible for the calcium retention. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that in these two cases of hemolytic anemia associated with high calcium content, Ca2+ permeability and the the level of cytosolic Ca2+ are normal.\r"

One was anemic relative to his hypoxemia, and the other two showed signs of increasing hypoxia. There was a significant negative correlation between siEp and arterial oxygen content. However, siEp did not correlate significantly with hemoglobin, hematocrit, PaO2, or SaO2. Despite normal siEp levels, the cyanotic children showed compensatory erythropoiesis with significantly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which did correlate inversely with PaO2 and SaO2. Arterial oxygen content was also significantly higher in the cyanotic subjects (p less than 0.02). The cyanotic children seemed to display the same pattern as observed in man and animals exposed to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia, where after an initial rise in erythropoietin values the levels fall to normal, while increased erythropoiesis is sustained.\r"

  ".W": "To define the role of activated platelets we have attempted to prepare monoclonal antibodies specific for activated platelets. The IgG2b antibody of one of the clones, designated 2.28, was studied in more detail. Native platelets from normal individuals bound 650 125I-2.28 molecules/platelet, whereas thrombin-activated platelets bound 12,600 molecules/platelet with high affinity (4.6 nmol/L). Immunoelectrophoretic analysis revealed that 2.28 reacted with a 53,000-mol wt protein. Immunocytochemistry showed that the antigen is located in a special subclass of platelet granules in unstimulated platelets and is exposed on the surface of thrombin-activated platelets. Double-labeling studies with immunogold labels disclosed simultaneous localization of 2.28 binding sites and cathepsin D in the same granules both in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells, thereby indicating that the antigen may be localized in lysosomes. By using flow cytofluorometry, in vivo platelet activation was studied in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Increased numbers of platelets that expressed the 2.28 antigen on their surface were observed after extracorporeal perfusion. The percentage of 2.28-positive platelets in the circulation was 3.9% +/- 2.7% (SD) in controls (n = 20), 5.5% +/- 3.0% in patients (n = 10) before cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, 24.6% +/- 13.5% after the bypass, and 8.5% in two patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. These data indicate that 2.28 may serve as a useful probe of in vitro and in vivo platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "An outline of radiological activity outside normal working hours over a 2-month period in a teaching hospital is presented. A 100-fold variation between specialties in the number of requests per 100 discharges and deaths is shown. Specialties with a high out-of-hours radiology demand also tended to have a high overall demand. Chest and abdomen radiographs accounted for approximately 82% of all investigations undertaken during the period of observation. Six radiological investigations--chest and abdomen radiographs, computed tomography, skull radiographs, intravenous urography and cardiac catheterisation--accounted for approximately 94% of all out-of-hours investigations. There was a 5.6-fold variation between investigations in the time taken to carry out one standard unit of work. In the health authority studied, it was estimated that pounds 93,000 was spent on radiographers' out-of-hours payments in 1984/85, of which almost 90% was directly related to the number of radiological procedures undertaken. It is suggested that the wide variation in rates of out-of-hours radiology usage between specialties requires more detailed examination. The limited range of procedures accounting for the great majority of the out-of-hours work makes a study feasible. The very marked variation in the time taken for one unit of work may result in important financial distortions if clinical budgeting becomes more widespread. The large excess cost of out-of-hours radiological investigations, which may be as much as pounds 16,000,000 per annum in England and Wales, offers the possibility of substantial savings if some of the investigations are shown to be of little clinical value outside normal working hours.\r"

At least a 10-fold increase in tumour uptake is necessary to combine tumour destruction with a survivable whole-body dose. The required improvement in specific uptake can be substantially reduced by accelerating the excretion of radioactivity outside the tumour. For all situations studied, yttrium 90 is superior to iodine 131 as a cytotoxic label.\r"

No correlation was found between clinical resistance of the tumor types and initial slope or survival at 2 Gy. Sublethal damage repair was assessed by comparing survival curves for acute and continuous irradiation. All cell lines showed significant SLDR, with the more clinically resistant tumour types demonstrating the best recovery rates. The survival data also demonstrated little difference in cell killing over the 0.1-0.7 Gy/h range. Using a modified linear-quadratic model with provisions for SLDR, it was found that for these cell lines the repair half-time was less than 1 h, with no significant change in the amount of recovery from sublethal damage at dose rates below 1 Gy/h.\r"

In contrast, for unclamped tumours giving the neutrons first (NNXXX) was more effective than the other two mixed schedules. This represented a true therapeutic gain and implies that if neutrons are used clinically as only part of a course of fractionated radiotherapy, they should be given at the beginning rather than at the end of treatment.\r"

It is often present together with other motor abnormalities in the pharyngo-oesophageal (PO) segment, such as defective tonicity, relaxation and peristalsis. However, such PO motor dysfunction was demonstrated in 22 dysphagic patients who had normal relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle. Ten had defective peristalsis in the segment cranial to the cricopharyngeus. In eight of these, barium contrast medium was retained at the end of the bolus passage. In one patient the cricopharyngeal muscle contracted too early ahead of the peristalsis. In four patients peristalsis and tonus were defective within the cervical oesophagus. In 145 non-dysphagic volunteers, with normal relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle, there was no such motor dysfunction in the PO segment. Our observations indicate that motor function of the PO segment is normally synchronous and symmetrical. Motor dysfunction within the PO segment is rare but is detectable with a cineradiographic technique. In the absence of other morphological and functional abnormalities within the pharynx proper, it is probable that these motor dysfunctions in a dysphagic patient may have importance for the development of symptoms.\r"

There was complete agreement in interpretation of the response to diuresis with both agents and 84% agreement in the transit time estimations.

A comparative study of iohexol, Hexabrix, and Iopamiron was carried out in a first group of 41 patients, and Hexabrix was compared with Iopamiron in a second group of 56. Evaluation criteria included local and general safety, as well as quality of angioscopy and angiography. In the first group of patients there were no significant differences in safety between the three agents. On the other hand, quality of visualisation during angioscopy with Hexabrix was clearly better. In the second group, safety and quality of the radiographic images were identical; however, once again, quality of angioscopy was better with Hexabrix than with Iopamiron. We conclude that Hexabrix appears to be the best opacifying agent currently available for cerebral and spinal-cord angiography. While results with Iopamiron were quite similar, the latter agent is slightly more expensive.\r"

Using a numerical technique based on impulse response function (IRF) analysis, we have investigated the effect of such variation between patients on 89Sr dosimetry. The whole-body IRF, HWB(t), is defined by the deconvolution of the whole-body strontium retention function, RWB(t), with the plasma retention function, P(t). For patients with minimal metastatic bone disease we assumed HWB(t) = HO(t), where HO is the IRF derived from the International Commission on Radiological Protection model for normal strontium metabolism. The strontium plasma clearance, k, was allowed to vary, and the resulting variation of RWB(t), P(t) and absorbed dose to bone marrow calculated. By convoluting P(t,k) with the IRF measured for a discrete metastasis, the effect of varying k on tumour dose was investigated. Tumour and bone marrow dose were shown to change by a factor of three as k varied over the range observed in patients. For patients with extensive metastatic bone disease we assumed HWB(t) = (1-beta)HO(t) + beta HS(t), where HS was the IRF measured for a superscan patient and beta was a parameter reflecting the extent of skeletal metastatic disease. The effect of varying beta on tumour and bone marrow dose was investigated, and dose shown to decrease by a factor of five as beta increased from zero to unity. Impulse response function analysis was found to be a powerful and useful aid in clarifying the relationship between strontium kinetics and 89Sr dosimetry.\r"

At the latter investigation, 338 of 1781 participants (19%) had a history of renal stone formation. In 47% there had been recurrences. For the individual there was a continuous risk of acquiring a first renal stone up to the age of 60. Approximately 0.5% of the entire unselected population experienced onset annually up to this age. Recurrent renal stones occurred primarily in those with a positive family history of stones or early onset of stones, as well as in those who previously had frequently formed stones. A carefully obtained clinical history should be useful in predicting recurrences in the individual stone former.\r"

The use of an intra-ureteric safety guide wire, indwelling throughout the procedure, facilitated ureteroscopic manipulation, minimised complications, reduced the need for subsequent open surgery and has been a prerequisite for our comparatively aggressive approach to ureteric disorders. The procedure may be time-consuming but prolonged manipulation within the ureter seems to carry little morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty men undergoing prostatectomy for symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction and low measured maximum flow rates (20 before and 10 after operation) were studied by means of urodynamic investigation. Paired studies were performed on each patient using a large catheter assembly (4 and 10 F) and a small catheter assembly (epidural line, outside diameter 1.1 mm). The order in which the studies were performed was varied randomly. Detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate was significantly greater in the large catheter study (73 +/- 30 cm H2O) than in the small catheter study (65 +/- 27 cm H2O; P less than 0.003). The maximum flow rate was significantly smaller in the large catheter study (8.9 +/- 9.5 ml/s) than in the small catheter study (12 +/- 7 ml/s; P less than 0.001). The increase in detrusor pressure at maximum flow that was noted during the large catheter study was confirmed in the 20 men who were studied before prostatectomy (mean increase 11 +/- 11 cm H2O; P less than 0.001) but no difference was found between the two methods in the 10 men studied after prostatectomy (50 +/- 19 cm H2O and 49 +/- 15 cm H2O). Using a large catheter assembly to perform urodynamic investigations has the advantage that repeated studies can be performed without recatheterisation, but it has the disadvantage of producing a small increase in detrusor pressure at maximum flow in men with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction. Few errors in diagnosis should result, however, if laboratories using such catheters are aware of this effect and establish their own limit of normal for voiding pressures.\r"

  ".W": "A study was performed on 130 men to compare the level of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in controls, patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and patients with prostatic carcinoma. The results showed that all 30 normal controls below 40 years of age had values less than 10 ng/ml. Of the 40 patients with BPH, all aged over 40 years, 13 (32.5%) had raised levels above 10 ng/ml. In the 60 patients with prostatic carcinoma, all over 40 years, 24 had localised disease (MO) and 36 had metastatic spread (M1), as judged by isotope bone scan. In patients with MO disease, 16 (66.6%) had raised PSA levels compared with 34 (94.5%) of those with M1 disease. The corresponding figures for raised prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) values were 4% in the MO group and 52.7% in the M1 group. PSA levels reflected neither the histological grade nor the local stage of the tumour and were of no value in estimating tumour burden. PSA was found to be a valuable index in the management of prostatic cancer because of this sensitivity. Stable disease not requiring hormonal manipulation was reflected by unchanging levels of PSA, whereas progressive disease requiring hormonal therapy was reflected by an alteration in the PSA levels corresponding to the patients' response. The same group of progressive disease patients showed only a 50% rise in serum PAP levels, confirming the greater sensitivity of PSA as a measure of prostate cancer. PSA measurements should be included in any further trials on prostatic carcinoma and should be regarded as a standard marker for evaluating response to therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that testicular descent may be governed by Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) was investigated by observing the position of the testes in 13 children with XY karyotype and persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS). It was found that there was a direct relationship between failure of testicular descent and the degree of development of the Mullerian system. Where the Mullerian system was complete, the testes were in an ovarian position but where only the vagina was present, the testes were sometimes found in the inguinal region. To discover whether excessive androgen activity in females might produce ovarian descent, the position of the ovaries in 15 children with severe adrenogenital syndrome was observed. Despite complete genital masculinisation in three children and almost complete in six, all but one ovary was in the normal position: that ovary had descended in an inguinal hernia sac. These findings suggest that MIS rather than androgens may be responsible for the first or abdominal phase of testicular descent. Even excessive androgen activity failed to cause ovarian descent.\r"
