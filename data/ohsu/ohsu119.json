Gemfibrozil (600 mg twice a day) significantly reduced total and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)--associated triglyceridemia (respectively-32.4% and -40.4%, after 6 weeks of treatment). No significant variations were noted in the lipid components of low-density lipoproteins; by contrast, a marked increase (18%) was detected in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)--associated cholesterol. Comparison of the two patient groups (type IIb and type IV) showed that those with type IIb had both a more significant reduction of triglyceridemia and a more marked increase of HDL-cholesterol. Apolipoprotein B levels were reduced in both groups (-12%) with no change in apolipoprotein AI. The cholesterol content in the HDL subfractions, separated by rate zonal ultracentrifugation, was raised in HDL3 (18%) and in HDL2 (14%). Both particles also showed significant increases of the cholesterol/protein and the cholesterol/phospholipid ratios. A non-statistically significant decrease in collagen-induced aggregation and in the release of thromboxane B2 was noted after treatment. These findings suggest that, similar to what was recently reported in normal individuals and in laboratory animals, the probable mode of action of gemfibrozil is in reducing the secretion of atherogenic lipoproteins, particularly VLDL, while stimulating the production of small HDL particles.\r"

  ".W": "The decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in long-term diabetes in humans and animals in preceded by a period of hyperfiltration that may be responsible for it. The mediators of the increase in glomerular filtration are unknown, but recent studies suggest a prominent role for prostaglandins. To test the hypothesis that prostaglandins mediate early hyperfiltration and contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy, we examined the effects of long-term aspirin (ASA) treatment on whole kidney GFR and renal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in control and diabetic rats 8 days and 16 weeks after streptozocin administration. The rats were divided into four groups, control, control with ASA (C/ASA), diabetic, and diabetic with ASA (D/ASA). We found that 8 days after streptozocin treatment, PGE2 synthesis and GFR were increased in diabetic rats. ASA treatment inhibited renal prostaglandin synthesis and prevented the GFR increase. ASA given to control rats reduced PGE2 synthesis without changing GFR. In the 16-week study diabetic rats had lower GFR and increased renal PGE2 synthesis. Diabetic rats also had thickened glomerular basement membrane compared with control rats. By contrast GFR did not fall and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane did not occur in diabetic rats receiving ASA. ASA had no effect on GFR or glomerular basement membrane in normal rats but decreased renal PGE2 synthesis. The data demonstrate that aspirin prevents early hyperfiltration and prevents the fall in GFR and glomerular basement membrane thickening that occurs over time in diabetic rats. Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis by aspirin, or some other effect of aspirin, may be responsible for the protection observed.\r"

The cultures were initiated from glomeruli-free cortical suspensions. Cells in culture demonstrated morphologic and functional characteristics highly suggestive of proximal tubular cells. The basal and stimulated synthesis of immunoassayable prostaglandin (PG) E2, PGF2 alpha, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane (Tx) B2 in response to various agonists, as well as the effect of two cyclooxygenase inhibitors, was assessed. Under both basal and stimulated conditions, PGE2 was the major product synthesized. PGF2 alpha and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were synthesized to a lesser extent, and TxB2 was undetectable. The basal synthesis of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha in cultured cells was found to be higher than in isolated proximal tubular fragments by sevenfold and fivefold, respectively. Exogenous arachidonate, angiotensin II, and the divalent cation ionophore A23187 stimulated all three immunoassayable prostaglandins in a dose-dependent manner. Arginine vasopressin (10(-5) mol/L) had no stimulatory effect. In Ca++-free media or in the presence of 10(-5) mol/L Ca++ channel blocker, verapamil, the stimulatory effects of angiotensin II and A23187 were ameliorated. The stimulatory effect of angiotensin II was inhibited by saralasin (10(-5) mol/L), indicating that receptor binding could mediate PGE2 synthesis. Both indomethacin and sulindac sulfide (10(-5) mol/L) reversibly inhibited PGE2 synthesis.\r"

In normal donors there was a direct relationship between platelet size and the number of surface glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex antigens per platelet. In patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, all platelets were equally negative with regard to the glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex phenotype, respectively. In contrast, each of six children with chronic myeloid leukemia (four of whom were Philadelphia chromosome negative and two of whom were Philadelphia chromosome positive) had two phenotypically distinct subpopulations of platelets: one glycoprotein Ib negative, the other glycoprotein Ib positive. In each of these six children with chronic myeloid leukemia, phenotypically distinct subpopulations of glycoprotein IIb-IIia complex-negative and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex-positive platelets were also detected. Polyclonal antiplatelet antibody bound to both the glycoprotein Ib-negative and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex-negative subpopulations. Age-matched controls (n = 3) and adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 3) showed single glycoprotein Ib-positive and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex-positive populations. In conclusion, flow cytometry detected distinct subpopulations of platelets in children with chronic myeloid leukemia. Flow cytometry is an important new method of identification and investigation of subpopulations of platelets in individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "The calcium antagonist nimodipine blocks the effects of many vasoconstrictors of cerebrovascular smooth muscle and may reduce the incidence of delayed cerebral ischaemia following subarachnoid haemorrhage though not necessarily by inhibiting the development of angiographic cerebral vasospasm. Post-haemorrhagic CSF contains abnormally large quantities of various eicosanoids that partly reflect enhanced production by cerebral arteries. Does nimodipine affect this process? The extra-arterial and intra-arterial production of PG6 keto-F1 alpha, PGE2, PGF2 alpha and TXB2 were measured in perfused common carotid arteries taken from rabbits in which the arteries had been ensheathed by blood clot in vivo for 7 days. All rabbits were given the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid to retard resolution of the clot, and half were given oral nimodipine (2 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Nimodipine significantly reduced the extra-arterial production of TXB2 during the third and fourth hours of perfusion and, less consistently, the production of PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and PG6 keto-F1 alpha. Lutrol, the solvent for nimodipine, had no such effect.\r"

  ".W": "Tidal volume (VT) delivered by mechanical ventilation during anesthesia may be influenced by factors related not only to the patient and the breathing circuit, but also to the interaction between the anesthesia machine and the anesthesia ventilator. To characterize this interaction, we studied in a test lung the effect of fresh-gas-flow (FGF) (0.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 L/min), inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio (I:E) (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3), and ventilatory frequency (8, 12, and 16 breaths/min) at fixed ventilator bellows excursions of 300, 600, and 900 ml. The influence of these variables was also estimated mathematically for a pediatric situation: a bellows excursion of 50 ml at 20 and 30 breaths/min. Each variable studied was associated with an increase, sometimes dramatic, in the delivered VT compared with that which was set. The VT augmentation was greatest at the highest FGF rate, largest I:E ratio, and slowest respiratory rate. Because the magnitude of the augmentation is independent of the VT setting, the percent increase is much larger for pediatric settings. For example, with VT set at 50 ml, delivered VT ranged from 71 ml (FGF 2.5 L/min, I:E 1:3, and 30 breaths/min) to 300 ml (FGF 10 L/min, I:E 1:1, and 20 breaths/min). Thus it is possible in the pediatric situation to increase the delivered VT by sixfold without changing the ventilator bellows excursion. The magnitude of the changes was slightly larger for the VT settings for adult patients because of the slower respiratory rate. This VT augmentation can be predicted by the product of FGF (ml/s) and inspiratory time (seconds).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three groups of six athymic mice bearing a human melanoma were injected via tail vein with (a) 0.55 mg human serum albumin (HSA) (control group), (b) 0.5 mg MoAb B3/25 + 0.55 mg HSA, and (c) 0.5 mg MoAb 96.5 + 0.55 mg HSA, respectively. Twenty-four hours later, each mouse was given an intravenous dose of 5 microCi [67Ga] citrate. Biodistribution of activity (percent injected dose per gram) determined 48 hr after injection of 67Ga showed a 75% decrease in tumor uptake in the group of mice that received B3/25 (anti-TFR MoAb) compared with the control group. In contrast, MoAb 96.5 did not show any effect on melanoma uptake of 67Ga. Histologic findings suggest that the decreased uptake was not due to cellular damage resulting from binding of B3/25 to TFR. The results of this study strongly suggest the involvement of TFR in the in vivo tumor uptake of 67Ga.\r"

The effects of using a passive electrode during surgical procedures and using an \"autosensor\" circuit to control power adjustment were also evaluated. It was found that a surgical blade adapted for electrosurgery produces a zone of denatured tissue that is not statistically different from that produced with a wire electrode. Moreover, no differences were noted between incisions produced with manual power adjustment and those with power controlled by the \"autosensor\" circuit. A significantly wider zone of denatured tissue was produced when incisions were made without a passive electrode in place.\r"

Only 8% of operated sides had persistent diminished sensation, usually mild, of the lower lip and chin.

All were ventilator dependent with chronic lung disease. The pretreatment Rrs was high (range 0.15 to 0.27 cm H2O X ml-1 X sec). After administration of salbutamol, the mean group Rrs decreased 24% +/- 11% (mean +/- SD), and Crs increased significantly, 17% +/- 21%. The response to ipratropium bromide in five infants did not differ significantly from their responses to salbutamol. Nebulized saline solution had no bronchodilator effect in five infants.

Overall the response to B-HT 933 was enhanced 4-fold when pulmonary perfusion pressure was elevated to 19.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg with U-46619 and almost 5-fold when elevated to 27.0 +/- 1.2 mm Hg. Pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II were unaffected by elevated pulmonary vascular tone. Enhanced responsiveness of B-HT 933 to elevated pulmonary vascular tone was antagonized by the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), and unaffected by the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.). When canine intralobar pulmonary veins were studied in vitro they contracted to B-HT 933 whereas intralobar pulmonary arteries did not respond. These data indicate that alpha-2 adrenoceptor responsiveness is enhanced markedly and selectively under conditions in which pulmonary vascular tone is elevated.\r"

  ".W": "Citalopram is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin uptake. In rat brain membranes [3H]citalopram demonstrates saturable and reversible binding with a KD of 0.8 nM and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of 570 fmol/mg of protein. The drug specificity for [3H]citalopram binding and synaptosomal serotonin uptake are closely correlated. Inhibition of [3H]citalopram binding by both serotonin and imipramine is consistent with a competitive interaction in both equilibrium and kinetic analyses. The autoradiographic pattern of [3H]citalopram binding sites closely resembles the distribution of serotonin. By contrast, detailed equilibrium-saturation analysis of [3H]imipramine binding reveals two binding components, i.e., high affinity (KD = 9 nM, Bmax = 420 fmol/mg of protein) and low affinity (KD = 553 nM, Bmax = 8560 fmol/mg of protein) sites. Specific [3H]imipramine binding, defined as the binding inhibited by 100 microM desipramine, is displaced only partially by serotonin. Various studies reveal that the serotonin-sensitive portion of binding corresponds to the high affinity sites of [3H]imipramine binding whereas the serotonin-insensitive binding corresponds to the low affinity sites. Lesioning of serotonin neurons with p-chloroamphetamine causes a large decrease in [3H]citalopram and serotonin-sensitive [3H]imipramine binding with only a small effect on serotonin-insensitive [3H]imipramine binding. The dissociation rate of [3H]imipramine or [3H]citalopram is not altered by citalopram, imipramine or serotonin up to concentrations of 10 microM. The regional distribution of serotonin sensitive [3H]imipramine high affinity binding sites closely resembles that of [3H]citalopram binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All sera (sufficient for testing by Western blot) with low-positive reactions gave negative results, and all sera (sufficient for testing by Western blot) with high-positive reactions gave positive results. All persons whose serum had high-positive reactions were male. Most (86%) had been seen at the only urban sexually transmitted disease clinic in New Mexico, and most (72%) were openly gay or bisexual. Of all gay and bisexual men evaluated, 14% (16/112) had high-positive reactions. Rapid plasma reagin positivity was significantly associated with HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay low (false) positivity. The relatively high rate of HIV seropositivity among gay men with other sexually transmitted diseases indicates that transmission of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is continuing in this low-incidence area and documents the need for testing and counseling programs in sexually transmitted disease clinics.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of glomerular immune complex (IC) deposition on glomerular eicosanoid synthesis and the role of the eicosanoids in glomerular pathophysiology. Rats received daily 10 mg i.v. injections of native bovine gamma-globulin (NBGG) or cationic bovine gamma-globulin (CBGG) for 21 days; age-matched controls were maintained. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed mesangial deposits of IC in the NBGG group and capillary wall deposits in the CBGG group, without light or electron microscopic evidence of leukocyte infiltration. One week after the last antigen dose, GFR was similar in all three groups, but RPF increased in the rats given CBGG; (8.37 +/- 0.90 vs. control 5.54 +/- 0.56 ml/min, P less than 0.05). Glomerular synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) was normal in animals that received NBGG. Rats given CBGG had increased glomerular production of PGE2, (2.23 +/- 0.37 vs. control 1.03 +/- 0.16 ng/mg glomerular dry wt, P less than 0.05) and TxB2 (3.12 +/- 0.50 vs. control 0.48 +/- 0.07 ng/mg glomerular dry wt, P less than 0.001). Proteinuria only developed in the rats given CBGG, 86.6 +/- 18 mg/24 hr, which correlated with glomerular TxA2 synthesis, r = 0.82, P = 0.01. Acute administration of the TxA2 synthesis inhibitor, UK-38,485, and a TxA2 receptor antagonist, EP-092, to rats given CBGG did not affect GFR or RPF. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, reduced both GFR and RPF by up to 40% in CBGG-immunized rats. Oral administration of UK-38,485 for six days to nephrotic rats did not result in a statistically significant reduction of proteinuria despite 85% inhibition of glomerular TxB2. We conclude that cationic antigen induces a glomerular disease pathologically similar to membranous nephropathy. The increment of RPF is most probably due to increased glomerular PGE2. The increased TxA2 has no effect on glomerular hemodynamics and probably is not a component in the pathogenesis of proteinuria.\r"

  ".W": "Indomethacin has been used to lower proteinuria in human glomerular diseases with controversial results. The mechanism of indomethacin beneficial effects has not been established. A possible explanation is that indomethacin reduces proteinuria by inhibiting the synthesis of renal prostaglandins (PGs); however, appropriate studies to address this issue have never been done. The objectives of the present study were: to investigate whether indomethacin influences protein excretion in an experimental model of immunologically-mediated glomerular disease; to establish if the possible favorable effect of indomethacin on proteinuria is related to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR); to establish the possible association between the antiproteinuric effect of indomethacin and its inhibitory effect on arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites of renal or extrarenal origin; and to further investigate the relationship between proteinuria and renal thromboxane (Tx) synthesis previously demonstrated in experimental models of nephrotoxic nephritis and adriamycin (ADR) nephrosis. To this purpose we used an experimental immune-complex disease, passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) which was induced in the rat by a single intravenous (i.v.) injection of heterologous serum directed against a brush border component (gp 330 antigen). Indomethacin at a dose of 6 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered for four consecutive days to PHN animals during the period of heavy proteinuria, effectively reduced urinary protein excretion. The reduction in proteinuria does not appear to be a consequence of a reduction in GFR as documented by inulin clearance. Glomerular synthesis and urinary excretion of vasodilatory prostacyclin (PGI2) and PGE2 were decreased or unchanged in PHN animals in respect to control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As compared with the general population, the patients had a relative risk of 133 (95 percent confidence interval, 98 to 176) and a mean (+/- SE) 20-year cumulative risk of 2.8 +/- 0.7 percent. Detailed data on treatment were obtained on 64 patients in whom bone cancer developed after childhood cancer. As compared with 209 matched controls who had survived cancer in childhood but who did not have bone cancer later, patients who had had radiation therapy had a 2.7-fold risk (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 7.7) and a sharp dose-response gradient reaching a 40-fold risk after doses to the bone of more than 6000 rad. The relative dose-response effect among patients who had been treated for retinoblastoma resembled that among patients with all other types of initial tumors, although the cumulative risk of bone cancer in the retinoblastoma group was higher. Similar numbers of patients were treated with orthovoltage and megavoltage; the patterns of risk among categories of doses did not differ according to the type of voltage. After adjustment for radiation therapy, treatment with alkylating agents was also linked to bone cancer (relative risk, 4.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 22.3), with the risk increasing as cumulative drug exposure rose. We conclude that both radiotherapy and chemotherapy with alkylating agents for childhood cancer increase the subsequent risk of bone cancer.\r"

One of these viruses, HTLV-IVP, was reportedly isolated from lymphocytes of a healthy female prostitute. Another isolate, LAV-2FG, was obtained from an AIDS patient and third, SBL-6669, from an individual with lymphadenopathy. Current epidemiological studies indicate that some of these virus isolates cause immune deficiency whereas others may not or may be less efficient at inducing immune deficiency. Similarly, STLV-III apparently does not cause immune deficiency in its natural host, African green monkey. A novel feature of HIV is the possession of a gene termed tat, which is implicated in its pathobiology. We report here that, like HIV, HTLV-IVP, LAV-2FG (HIV-2) and SBL-6669, as well as STLV-IIIAGM possess the putative tat gene, irrespective of their pathogenic potential in vivo. Interestingly, HTLV-IVP/LAV-2FG long terminal repeat (LTR) is equally well transactivated by the HTLV-IVP/LAV-2FG and HTLV-IIIB tat function, HTLV-IIIB LTR responds better to its own tat function.\r"

Chimpanzees are the only other animals that can be infected by HIV, and therefore the chimpanzee-HIV model system is useful for testing potential HIV vaccines. However, with one exception, there have been no reports of clinical manifestations of AIDS in chimpanzees. We report here results of an HIV vaccine trial in which nine chimpanzees were first immunized with either a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the envelope glycoproteins of HIV strain LAV-1 (v-env5) or a control recombinant vaccinia virus and were then challenged with a high or low dose of LAV-1. Although HIV-specific antibody and T-cell responses were elicited by immunization, virus was isolated from lymphocytes of all challenged chimpanzees, indicating that immunization did not prevent infection by HIV. Among the animals that received a higher dose of LAV-1, one of two control chimpanzees, but none of the four v-env5-immunized chimpanzees developed substantial and persistent lymphadenopathy.\r"

The performance of ten dentists with a minimum of 1.5 years of experience with xeroradiography was compared with that of dentists inexperienced with xeroradiographs. These data, collected in a clinical environment, were compared with those collected in a controlled laboratory environment by dentists inexperienced in interpretation of xeroradiographs. It was found that lack of experience in viewing xeroradiographs does not compromise interpretation of these images. Furthermore, both high- and low-contrast xeroradiographs were found to be slightly more useful than conventional radiographs for the detection of proximal surface caries. In general, observers who had optimal viewing conditions performed better than those in a clinical environment.\r"

The lesions of 22 patients were classified clinically into nonaggressive and the lesions of 10 patients were classified into aggressive categories in accordance with the method of Chuong and Kaban. The majority of patients with aggressive lesions had recurrent tumors within 2 years and/or experienced pain, root resorption, and cortical perforation. Giant cells were selected in 25 random high-power magnification (X400) fields and measured by means of the Leitz Texture Analysis System-Plus. Linear stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to each parameter studied. Clinically aggressive giant cell lesions were characterized by a higher number of giant cells and greater fractional surface area when compared with the nonaggressive tumors. With the use of the \"jackknife\" classification procedure, the accuracy of the two statistically significant parameters (number of giant cells and fractional surface area) in predicting the aggressiveness or the nonaggressiveness of our group of central giant cell granulomas was, respectively, 70% and 82%. This study provides further evidence that the use of cytometric analysis of giant cells may be helpful in predicting prognosis and in planning treatment for these often difficult-to-manage lesions.\r"

A patchy, depapillated tongue was seen in six patients, and ulcers with uncertain cause were seen in three patients. Gingival bleeding, perioral molluscum contagiosum, and brown hairy tongue each occurred in one patient. In this study, \"hairy\" leukoplakia and Kaposi's sarcoma occurred exclusively in homosexual and bisexual men with AIDS, and occurred significantly more frequently in this group than in heterosexual patients with AIDS. There was no significant difference between these groups in the frequency of occurrence of other findings.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective investigation of 208 patients with painful, arthrographically verified temporomandibular joint disk displacement revealed that seven patients (3%) demonstrated lingual numbness associated with speech articulation impairment. The speech disorder was characterized primarily by a distortion in the production of /s,r,d, and t/. The lingual numbness and the speech disorder had in all cases started in association with a painful onset of permanent displacement of the temporomandibular joint disk. Local anesthetic blocking of the auriculotemporal nerve eliminated both joint pain and muscle pain and normalized tongue sensitivity and speech articulation. Placebo injections of saline solution resulted in no change. The explanation of the phenomenon is that the course of the lingual nerve for these seven patients was through the lateral pterygoid muscle rather than mesial to the muscle bundles and that an arthrokinetic myospasm resulted in compression of the lingual nerve. In order to test the hypothesis that the condition of lingual nerve entrapment in the lateral pterygoid muscle does exist, the course of the nerve was studied at dissection in 52 specimens from 26 cadaver heads. In 49 of the specimens, the lingual nerve descended deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle as has been traditionally defined. However, in three specimens, the nerve passed through the inferior belly of the muscle, revealing the condition of lingual nerve entrapment.\r"

None of the administered antidepressants seem to have appreciable analgesic activity when analgesia is tested by the tail-immersion method. Citalopram, imipramine and nortriptyline, but not amineptine, increase the analgesia induced by inescapable footshock delivered continuously for 2 min to rats. Citalopram is the most potent drug. Our results support the suggested importance of 5-HT and noradrenaline terminals, but not those of dopamine, in the mediation of the stress-induced analgesia and seem to support the hypothesis that the analgesic activity of antidepressants is partially related to their modulating effects on the endogenously released opioid peptides involved in the endogenous pain inhibitory systems.\r"

All 12 infants developed laboratory and/or clinical evidence of HIV infection, usually in the first year of life. Ten of 12 infants had serum antibody to HIV when tested between 9 and 42 months of age. The two seronegative infants were severely hypogammaglobulinemic when they were tested. Nine infants developed a variety of illnesses attributable to HIV infection, but only 2 fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In follow-up ranging from 2 1/2 to 4 years 5 patients (42%) have died. Four patients had HIV-associated illnesses but recovered and now have few if any symptoms attributable to HIV infection. Three children have never had signs or symptoms attributable to HIV. Immunologic abnormalities were present in all patients; the most consistent finding was a decrease in the proportion of T helper cells. Three patients had severe panhypogammaglobulinemia. The hypogammaglobulinemic infants had significantly lower numbers and percentages of T helper cells compared to the remaining patients (P less than 0.01). We conclude that exposure to HIV via transfusion in the neonatal period results in an extremely high rate of infection with substantial mortality and morbidity, but clinical recovery occurs in some patients. Also hypogammaglobulinemia may be more common in infants with HIV infection than previously appreciated.\r"

Clones producing immunoreactive material contain sequences homologous to, yet distinct from, phenylalanine hydroxylase. The rabbit cDNA hybridizes to mRNA in pineal body and brainstem but not in liver. Comparison of the rabbit tryptophan hydroxylase sequence with the sequences of phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase demonstrates that these three biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases are highly homologous, reflecting a common evolutionary origin from a single primordial genetic locus. The pattern of sequence homology supports the hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the molecules constitute the enzymatic activity cores, and the amino-terminal thirds of the molecules constitute domains for substrate specificity.\r"

In this report the subcellular distribution of PLC-I and PLC-II in brain homogenates was measured using RIA. Significant differences were found in the distribution of the two forms of PLC in 100,000 X g supernatants (cytosolic fraction) of brain homogenized in hypotonic buffer and 2 M KCl extracts of washed pellets (particulate fraction). More than 90% of PLC-II was found in the cytosolic fractions, whereas the PLC-I-like molecules were equally distributed between cytosolic and particulate fractions. Purification of PLC enzyme to near homogeneity from the particulate fractions yielded two PLC enzymes, both of which could be recognized by anti-PLC-I antibodies but not by anti-PLC-II antibodies. Their Mr values, determined under denaturing conditions, were 150,000 and 140,000. The polypeptide of the enzyme of Mr 150,000 seems to be the same as that of the cytosolic enzyme PLC-I: their Mr values were identical, and their trypsin-digested peptides yielded a similar elution profile on a C18 reverse-phase column. We propose, therefore, that PLC-I and its truncated form are weakly associated with membranes.\r"

  ".W": "A glandular-like kallikrein enzyme, a member of a well-characterized family of specific arginyl endopeptidases that may be involved in prohormone processing, has previously been shown to be present in the anterior and neurointermediate lobes of the rat pituitary. We isolated glandular-like kallikrein cDNAs from cDNA libraries prepared from these two tissues. By nucleotide sequence, restriction endonuclease, solution hybridization/nuclease protection, and blot analyses, we showed that, of the 8-10 rat kallikrein-encoding genes, it is the true glandular kallikrein mRNA that is expressed in both pituitary lobes. RNA blot-hybridization analysis of anterior and neurointermediate lobe pituitary RNA revealed a kallikrein mRNA of approximately equal to 900 base pairs. As analyzed by blot-hybridization and solution hybridization/nuclease protection analyses, the true glandular kallikrein mRNA was present at low levels: approximately equal to 0.05% of total mRNA in both male and female neurointermediate lobes. Similar low levels of the glandular kallikrein mRNA were found in the male anterior lobe, whereas the levels were 10- to 15-fold higher in the female anterior lobe. In vivo administration of a dopamine agonist (bromocryptine) or antagonist (haloperidol) caused a decrease or increase, respectively, in the amount of true glandular kallikrein mRNA in the neurointermediate lobe of both sexes that closely paralleled changes in proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels. Bromocryptine decreased and haloperidol increased true glandular kallikrein mRNA levels in the female anterior lobe but had no effect in the male anterior lobe. Nuclear transcription run-on studies showed that the changes in mRNA were due, at least in part, to parallel effects of haloperidol on kallikrein gene transcription. Thus, these studies have demonstrated that the pituitary expresses the glandular-type member of the kallikrein gene family and that dopaminergic compounds elicit changes in kallikrein mRNA, at least in part, by modulating transcription. In the intermediate lobe, regulation of true glandular kallikrein gene expression is parallel to that of proopiomelanocortin gene expression, suggesting that the enzyme may play a physiological role in the production and/or secretion of the proopiomelanocortin peptides in this tissue.\r"

  ".U": "87289643\r", 
  ".W": "Two forms of human thyroid peroxidase cDNAs were isolated from a lambda gt11 cDNA library, prepared from Graves disease thyroid tissue mRNA, by use of oligonucleotides. The longest complete cDNA, designated phTPO-1, has 3048 nucleotides and an open reading frame consisting of 933 amino acids, which would encode a protein with a molecular weight of 103,026. Five potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites are found in the deduced amino acid sequence. The second peroxidase cDNA, designated phTPO-2, is almost identical to phTPO-1 beginning 605 base pairs downstream except that it contains 1-base-pair difference and lacks 171 base pairs in the middle of the sequence. This results in a loss of 57 amino acids corresponding to a molecular weight of 6282. Interestingly, this 171-nucleotide sequence has GT and AG at its 5' and 3' boundaries, respectively, that are in good agreement with donor and acceptor splice site consensus sequences. Using specific oligonucleotide probes for the mRNAs derived from the cDNA sequences hTPO-1 and hTPO-2, we show that both are expressed in all thyroid tissues examined and the relative level of two mRNAs is different in each sample. These results suggest that two thyroid peroxidase proteins might be generated through alternate splicing of the same gene. By using somatic cell hybrid lines, the thyroid peroxidase gene was mapped to the short arm of human chromosome 2.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the 2463-base-pair cDNA insert includes a 145-base-pair 5' untranslated region, an open reading frame of 831 base pairs corresponding to 277 amino acids (Mr = 30,993), and a 1487-base-pair 3' untranslated region. The deduced amino acid sequence is colinear with that determined by amino acid sequencing of the N-terminus peptide (41 residues) and nine tryptic peptides (93 additional residues). The receptor is synthesized as a precursor with a signal peptide of 20 amino acids. The hydrophobicity profile of the receptor indicates a single membrane-spanning domain, which separates an N-terminal region containing five potential N-glycosylation sites from a C-terminal region lacking N-glycosylation sites. Thus the N-terminal (Mr = 18,299) and C-terminal (Mr less than or equal to 7648) segments of the mature receptor are assumed to be exposed to the extracytosolic and cytosolic sides of the membrane, respectively. Analysis of a panel of somatic cell (mouse-human) hybrids shows that the gene for the receptor is located on human chromosome 12.\r"

Each fraction was analyzed by \"diagonal\" (two-dimensional nonreducing-reducing) NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Crosslinked proteins below the diagonal were radioiodinated and identified by two-dimensional acidic urea-NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis. Each of the acidic proteins P1 and P2 was crosslinked individually to the same third protein, P0. The fractions containing acidic proteins were also analyzed by two-dimensional nonequilibrium isoelectric focusing-NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two crosslinked complexes were observed that coincide in isoelectric positions with monomeric P1 and P2, respectively. Both P1 and P2 appear to form crosslinked homodimers. These results suggest the presence in the 60S subunit of (P1)2 and (P2)2 dimers, each of which is anchored to P0. Protein P0 appears to play the same role as L10 in Escherichia coli ribosomes and may form a pentameric complex with the two dimers in the 60S subunits.\r"

Here we show that high levels of rat NPY mRNA are also found in peripheral blood cells, bone marrow, lung, and spleen. Furthermore, radioimmunoassay revealed high levels of NPY-like peptide in these tissues. In mice, the levels of splenic NPY mRNA and immunoreactive peptide differed extensively between strains and were greatly elevated in several strains (NZB, NZBxW, and BXSB) that develop a disease resembling human systemic lupus erythematosus. Like the rat, the NZB mouse showed a high content of NPY mRNA in peripheral blood cells and bone marrow. Immunohistochemical staining revealed NPY-like immunoreactivity in large cells morphologically identifiable as megakaryocytes in rat bone marrow and in the spleen of the NZB mouse strain. Expression of NPY mRNA in megakaryocytes in rat bone marrow and NZB mouse spleen was confirmed by in situ hybridization. These results indicate that NPY is synthesized in megakaryocytes, implying that NPY can be released from platelets and function as a vasoconstrictor during blood-vessel damage. In addition, the increase in splenic NPY in certain autoimmune mouse strains adds to the list of abnormalities associated with these strains.\r"

The required codon changes were introduced in the bacterioopsin gene by replacement of appropriate restriction fragments by synthetic counterparts containing the desired nucleotide changes. The denatured opsin polypeptides obtained by expression of the mutant genes in Escherichia coli were purified and treated with a mixture of detergents, phospholipids, and retinal in a previously established renaturation procedure. All of the mutant proteins folded to regenerate bacteriorhodopsin-like chromophores. Three mutants with tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at positions 57, 83, and 185 regenerated the chromophore more slowly than the wild-type protein, and two of these mutants, Phe-57 and -83, showed slightly blue-shifted chromophores. When reconstituted into liposomes all of the mutant proteins with single Tyr----Phe substitutions pumped protons at rates and levels comparable to those of the wild-type bacteriorhodopsin. We conclude that single substitutions of tyrosine by phenylalanine do not affect folding, retinal binding, or light-dependent proton pumping in bacteriorhodopsin.\r"

TGF-beta also prevents the phorbol ester-induced invasion of capillary endothelial cells into collagen matrices--i.e., blocks angiogenesis in vitro. TGF-beta promotes the incorporation of fibronectin into the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells and stimulates the secretion of other proteins--mainly of 55- and 180-kDa components. We show furthermore that endothelial cells express TGF-beta receptors similar in size to those of other tissue culture cell lines: a 280-kDa complex is present in subconfluent cells, and 85- and 72-kDa protein bands are seen in confluent cells. The various effects of TGF-beta on endothelial cells suggest that these cells are an important target of TGF-beta during wound healing and angiogenesis.\r"

There were 30-40 sedimentable complexes per platelet and about three times this number of soluble complexes. Pretreatment of rabbit or human platelets with prostaglandin E1 and theophylline decreased the formation of both types of complex by as much as 60-80%. The pretreatment was particularly effective when low doses of thrombin were used. When added to control platelets, such doses of thrombin caused the formation of sedimentable complexes and the concomitant formation of inositol trisphosphate. However, when added to platelets that had been pretreated with prostaglandin E1 and theophylline, low doses of thrombin had little or no effect on either reaction.\r"

Previously, on the basis of reactivity patterns with monoclonal antibodies, the greatest intersubgroup variation was shown to occur in the G protein, the putative attachment glycoprotein. To delineate the molecular basis for this variation, we have determined the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the G mRNAs and proteins representing a subgroup A (Long strain) and a subgroup B (18537 strain) virus. These sequences were compared to the available G mRNA sequence for another subgroup A (A2 strain) virus. The Long G protein shared 94% amino acid identity with the A2 G protein. In contrast, the 18537 G protein shared only 53% amino acid identity with the A2 sequence; interestingly, most of the sequence divergence occurred in the proposed extracellular domain of the G protein. This extensive divergence for the G protein was significantly greater than that observed for other RSV proteins. Despite this considerable divarication, the proposed extracellular domains of the G proteins contained a single region of highly conserved sequence and secondary structure that may represent a conserved structural or function domain, perhaps involved in attachment to cellular receptors. Furthermore, this conserved region may comprise part of an epitope that is shared between the two subgroup G proteins and may significantly contribute to the fact that, despite extensive overall amino acid sequence divergence, the RSV G proteins maintain significant antigenic relatedness.\r"

However, the minimal transforming region (6.6 kb) identified in our cloned DNA borders on the c-fms DNA region but does not contain c-fms coding sequences. The fms sequences are also not represented in the two transcripts (approximately equal to 1.2 and 3.5 kb) detected in NIH 3T3 transformants; however, they might provide elements regulating expression. Hybridization to several known oncogene probes and preliminary sequencing data indicate that we have identified a previously unrecognized \"activated\" oncogene. Since the rearrangements present in our cloned DNA sequences are not detectable in the original Kaposi tumor DNA used for transfection, it is possible that this oncogene was generated during gene transfer.\r"

We have isolated a copy of an alternatively spliced PLP gene transcript from a mouse brain cDNA library that was screened for PLP-related sequences. The encoded 241-amino acid protein differs from PLP by an internal deletion of 35-amino acid residues (116-150) from the major hydrophilic domain. This PLP variant is identical with the DM-20 protein of myelin, previously described as a brain-specific myelin component and known to be related to PLP. We determined the corresponding nucleotide sequence of the rat PLP gene and found that DM-20 mRNA results when a second 5' splice site, located 105 nucleotides within the third exon of the primary PLP transcript, is utilized in precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. This demonstrates that alternative 5' splice site selection can determine the protein product of a cellular gene. DM-20 mRNA is expressed in rat brain with approximately 50% abundance relative to PLP mRNA and appears to be developmentally coregulated.\r"

We show here that T3 receptor binds specifically to a site just upstream of the basal rGH promoter. This binding site includes two copies of a 7-base-pair direct repeat, the centers of which are separated by 10 base pairs. Deletions that specifically remove the T3 receptor binding site drastically reduce response to T3 in transient transfection experiments. These results demonstrate that T3 receptor can recognize specific DNA sequences and suggest that it can act directly as a positive transcriptional regulatory factor.\r"

Using RNA gel-blot analysis of purified mouse and hamster germ cells and of testes from prepuberal and germ cell-deficient mutant mice, we now have demonstrated that, in addition to its previously described expression by somatic (Leydig) cells, the gene for a second opioid peptide precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), is also expressed by spermatogenic cells. Of particular significance is the finding that the RNAs for proenkephalin and POMC are differentially regulated during spermatogenesis. Two forms of POMC RNA were detected in mouse testis, a larger component 675- to 750-nucleotides (nt) in size common to somatic and spermatogenic cells and a smaller 625-nt RNA found only in pachytene spermatocytes. Two distinct, cell-specific proenkephalin RNAs were also shown to be present in mouse testis: a 1700-nt transcript previously shown to be expressed by spermatogenic cells and a 1450-nt form associated with somatic cells. These data suggest that proenkephalin- and POMC-derived peptides are produced by both somatic cells and germ cells in the testis and in germ cells these two families of opioid peptides may function at different stages of spermatogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contains two types of subunit, alpha (Mr 50,000) and beta (Mr 60,000/58,000), both of which undergo Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation is known to convert the enzyme to a Ca2+/calmodulin-independent form. In the present study, we have characterized the autophosphorylation sites on rat forebrain Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that are most likely to be responsible for the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independence. Under conditions (0 degree C, low concentrations of ATP) sufficient to generate close to maximal Ca2+/calmodulin-independence, only a few of the phosphorylatable sites on the enzyme became phosphorylated. These autophosphorylation sites were examined by phospho amino acid analysis, two-dimensional thermolytic phosphopeptide mapping, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The time course of phosphorylation of threonine in both alpha and beta subunits was similar to the time course of the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independence. Moreover, the time course of phosphorylation of one set of peptides, referred to as peptide 1/1', present in both alpha and beta subunits was similar to the time course of the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independence. Threonine was the only amino acid phosphorylated in peptide 1/1'. An additional peptide, referred to as peptide 2, was phosphorylated in the beta subunit. The time course of phosphorylation of peptide 2, which also contained only phosphothreonine, did not parallel the time course of the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independence. It is likely that the phosphorylation of a threonine residue on peptide 1/1' is responsible for the generation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independence of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.\r"

Amino acid sequence analysis of the major 32P-labeled tryptic fragments showed beta-subunit Tyr-368 to be present at noncatalytic sites and beta Tyr-345 to be present at catalytic sites. From the relationship between the degree of inhibition and extent of modification, it is estimated that one-third of the catalytic sites or two-thirds of the noncatalytic sites must be modified to give near-complete inhibition of catalytic activity.\r"

In a first approach, axonemal proteins were hydrolyzed by formic acid, cyanogen bromide, or chymotrypsin and analyzed with immunoblots. The smallest alpha-tubulin peptide retained on nitrocellulose and containing antibody-binding site(s) was found to span amino acids 37-138 (alpha 37-138). A smaller antibody-binding peptide, identified as alpha 25-50, was obtained by complete digestion of alpha-tubulin with chymotrypsin. This fragment was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and assayed by its ability to bind 6-11B-1 in solution. Determination of the amino acid sequences of alpha 37-138 and alpha 25-50 showed that residue 40 in axonemal alpha-tubulin is epsilon N-acetyllysine. A sequence very similar to Chlamydomonas alpha 25-50 is found in the majority of alpha-tubulins analyzed so far. However, the corresponding region is markedly divergent in some alpha-tubulin isoforms from chicken, Drosophila, and yeast.\r"

We have carried out molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations to study intercalation complexes between 9-amino acridine and the base-paired heptanucleotide d(CGCGCGC) X d(GCGCGCG), in which the neighbor-exclusion principle was both obeyed and violated. Our studies find no stereochemical preference that favors the neighbor-exclusion-obeying structures over the neighbor-exclusion-violating structures. Alternative explanations for the existence of the neighbor-exclusion principle are vibrational entropy effects that we calculate to favor the more flexible neighbor-exclusion models over the more rigid neighbor-exclusion-violating models and polyelectrolyte (counterion release) effects.\r"

Subcloning of this hybrid resulted in the emergence of a subclone, K9, whose testosterone production is more than 10 times that of parent clone LK17, after hCG stimulation, with an ED50 of 37 pM. Testosterone synthesis by K9 cells was multiplied by 25 after gonadotropin stimulation, and binding of hCG declined after prolonged exposure to the hormone. These similarities with murine Leydig cells in primary culture make the K9 clone an attractive alternative for physiological studies.\r"

Endosomal fractions were prepared by \"immuno-isolation\" on a solid support with a monoclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of the G protein. Maximal internalization of the G protein occurred within 5 min at 37 degrees C. From this early endosome the G molecules follow a branched pathway: 50% recycles to the cell surface, while 50% is transported along the endocytic route to the lysosomal compartment. The proportion of G protein following each pathway can be modulated. When the amount of implanted G protein was increased, the fraction of G molecules recycling to the cell surface was reduced. When the G molecules were cross-linked with an antibody prior to the internalization step, recycling to the cell surface was abolished. The cell-free analysis of vesicle fusion was carried out with endosomal fractions immuno-isolated after 5, 10, 15, and 30 min of G-protein internalization at 37 degrees C. Fusion competence was at a maximum with the fraction isolated 5 min after internalization and then decreased with a half-life of approximately equal to 3 min with fractions isolated at later time points. The fusion-competent compartment is the early endosome where sorting of the transmembrane G protein to recycling or degradation occurs.\r"

  ".W": "We report that human breast cancer cells secrete a growth factor that is biologically and immunologically similar to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Serum-free medium conditioned by estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 or estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells contains a mitogenic or \"competence\" activity that is capable of inducing incorporation of [3H]thymidine into quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells in the presence of platelet-poor plasma. In addition, the conditioned medium contains an activity that competes with 125I-labeled PDGF for binding to PDGF receptors on normal human fibroblasts. The secretion of PDGF-like activity by the hormone-responsive cell line MCF-7 is stimulated by 17 beta-estradiol. Like authentic PDGF, the PDGF-like activity produced by breast cancer cells is stable after acid and heat treatment (95 degrees C) and inhibited by reducing agents. The mitogenic activity comigrates with a material of approximately equal to 30 kDa on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation with PDGF antiserum of proteins from metabolically labeled cell lysates and conditioned medium followed by analysis on nonreducing NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels identified proteins of 30 and 34 kDa. Upon reduction, the 30- and 34-kDa bands were converted to 15- and 16-kDa bands suggesting that the immunoprecipitated proteins were made up of two disulfide-linked polypeptides similar to PDGF. Hybridization studies with cDNA probes for the A chain of PDGF and the B chain of PDGF/SIS identified transcripts for both PDGF chains in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The data summarized above provide conclusive evidence for the synthesis and hormonally regulated secretion of a PDGF-like mitogen by breast carcinoma cells. Production of a PDGF-like growth factor by breast cancer cell lines may be important in mediating paracrine stimulation of tumor growth.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of the mitogenic peptides bombesin and vasopressin to quiescent Swiss 3T3 mouse cells increased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration without any measurable delay. In contrast, there was a significant lag period (16 +/- 1.2 s) before platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This lag was not diminished at high concentrations of either porcine or human PDGF. Similar results were obtained in 3T3 cells loaded with quin-2 or fura-2. The differences in the effects of bombesin, vasopressin, and PDGF on Ca2+ movements were also substantiated by measurements of 45Ca2+ efflux and of cellular 45Ca2+ content. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters inhibited Ca2+ mobilization induced by either bombesin or vasopressin. In contrast, phorbol esters had no effect on PDGF-induced cytosolic Ca2+ concentration increase or acceleration of 45Ca2+ efflux. Finally, bombesin and vasopressin caused a rapid increase in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, whereas PDGF, even at a saturating concentration, exerted only a small effect. These results indicate that the signal transduction pathways activated by PDGF that lead to Ca2+ mobilization can be distinguished from those utilized by bombesin and vasopressin.\r"

The Mr 25,000 form, like the Mr 18,000 form, was not eluted from the heparin-affinity column with 0.95 M NaCl, but was eluted with 2 M NaCl. The Mr 25,000 guinea pig protein stimulated plasminogen activator production by cultured bovine capillary endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of 0.1-10 ng/ml, the same range that was effective for guinea pig and human Mr 18,000 bFGFs. The binding of human 125I-labeled bFGF to baby hamster kidney cells is inhibited equally by the Mr 25,000 guinea pig protein and the Mr 18,000 guinea pig and human bFGFs. Polyclonal antibodies raised against human bFGF recognize both the Mr 25,000 and 18,000 guinea pig proteins in an immunoblot analysis. In a radioimmunoassay, both the Mr 25,000 and Mr 18,000 guinea pig proteins compete equally well with iodinated human bFGF for binding to the anti-human bFGF antibodies. When treated with low concentrations of trypsin, the Mr 25,000 guinea pig bFGF was converted to a Mr 18,000 protein. These results show that the two molecules are closely related and suggest that the Mr 25,000 protein shares substantial homology with the Mr 18,000 bFGF.\r"

Messenger RNAs transcribed from these mutants were translated in a cell-free system supplemented with microsomal membranes. Among six of the seven transmembrane segments of opsin that were analyzed, five were able to function as signal sequences and also expressed stop-transfer sequences of variable strength. By the criteria of extractability at pH 11 and protease sensitivity, the presence of a signal sequence in combination with a \"strong\" stop-transfer sequence yielded integration into the lipid bilayer of the majority of chains. However, in combination with a \"weak\" stop-transfer sequence, we observed integration into the lipid bilayer of only some chains, with the others either completely translocated across the membrane or retained in a water-accessible space in the membrane.\r"

Three independently isolated mutant cell lines were characterized in detail. Analysis of the expression of the TEC-1 epitope in somatic cell hybrids constructed between wild-type and mutant cells and between two mutant cell types revealed that the mutant phenotypes are recessive and that the mutants belong to, at least, two complementation groups. Each mutant cell line exhibited a unique binding pattern of four monoclonal antibodies and five lectins, and different properties of large glycopeptides were distinguished by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. The combined data suggest that our mutants identify three genes involved in the synthesis of embryoglycan, one of which appears to be the regulatory or structural gene for fucosyltransferase. One mutant cell line was completely deprived of embryoglycan and several carbohydrate structures typical of early embryonic and embryonal carcinoma cells; however, the cells were similar to parental cells in their morphology, their ability to form aggregates when cultured in suspension, their ability to differentiate into neuron-like cells after treatment with retinoic acid, and their ability to form tumors composed of embryonal carcinoma cells. Thus, embryoglycan is not required for the expression of a number of properties of the embryonal carcinoma phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (Linnaeus) Heynhold was shown to contain an alpha-tubulin gene family consisting of at least four genes and/or pseudogenes. The primary structure of a transcribed alpha-tubulin gene was determined. A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the A. thaliana alpha-tubulin with the predicted amino acid sequences of alpha-tubulins of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Stylonychia lemnae, and Homo spaiens reveals a high degree of homology; 90%, 87%, and 83% identity, respectively. Thus, a plant alpha-tubulin exhibits a high degree of homology to the alpha-tubulins of protists and animals. The coding sequence of the A. thaliana alpha-tubulin gene is interrupted by four introns, which occur at positions different from those of the less numerous introns of C. reinhardtii and rat alpha-tubulin genes. S1 nuclease mapping data showed that transcription is initiated 99 +/- 1 base pairs upstream from the translation initiation codon. Both 5' and 3' noncoding gene-specific probes were used to examine the expression of the alpha-tubulin gene in leaves, roots, and flowers by hybridization to total RNA isolated from these tissues. The results showed that the alpha-tubulin gene was transcribed in all three tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured cells from individuals affected with Fanconi anemia (FA) exhibit spontaneous chromosome breakage and hypersensitivity to the cell killing and clastogenic effects of the difunctional alkylating agent diepoxybutane (DEB). We report here the correction of both of these DEB-hypersensitivity phenotypes of FA cells achieved by cotransfection of normal placental or Chinese hamster lung cell DNA and the plasmid pSV2-neo-SVgpt. Transfectants were selected for clonogenic survival after treatment with DEB at a dose of 5 micrograms/ml. At this dose of DEB, the clonogenicity of normal fibroblasts was reduced to 50% and that of FA fibroblasts was reduced to zero. DEB-resistant (DEBr) colonies selected in this system exhibited a normal response to DEB-induced chromosome breakage and resistance to repeated DEB treatment. The neo and gpt sequences were detected by Southern blot analysis of DNA from one of four DEBr colonies independently derived from transfection of human DNA and one of three DEBr colonies independently derived from transfection of Chinese hamster DNA. In addition, Alu-equivalent hamster sequences were detected in three of seven additional independently derived colonies from transfection of Chinese hamster DNA. The DEBr phenotype of these colonies was stably maintained over several subcultures. Our results demonstrate that DNA sequences that complement the two hallmark cellular phenotypes (cellular and chromosomal hypersensitivity to alkylating agents) of FA are present in human as well as Chinese hamster DNA. The cloning of these genes using transfection strategies can be expected to enable molecular characterization of FA.\r"

Nevertheless, 40-50% of the enzymatic activity conditioned by a nonmutant allele at the bronze-1 locus is routinely recovered in crude extracts prepared from plants carrying bz-m13CS9 in the absence of an autonomous Suppressor-mutator element. Analyses of RNAs produced by such plants show that transcription proceeds through the dSpm. The dSpm sequence of the messenger RNA precursor is then removed by RNA splicing using the donor site of the single bronze-1 intron and an acceptor site within the inverted terminal repeat of the dSpm. This results in a messenger RNA with the proper reading frame that could produce a functional enzyme. These data demonstrate that this dSpm insertion in an exon of a structural gene has produced a functional allele with a novel intron consisting, in part, of the dSpm. This mechanism appears to allow dSpm elements to reduce the impact of their insertions on gene expression.\r"

Their hybridization patterns with segment-specific probes are consistent with the close linkage of heavy-chain constant (CH), joining (JH), and variable (VH) gene segments. Differences in the nucleotide sequences of the first CH exon of five genes primarily are localized to 5' positions; extended regions of sequence identity are noted at 3' positions. The predicted amino acid sequences of each gene are different and are related distantly to the corresponding regions of higher vertebrate immunoglobulins. Gene-specific oligodeoxynucleotide probes were used to establish that at least three of the five genes are transcriptionally active. Quantitative gene titration data are consistent with the large numbers of genes suggested by the library screening analyses. In this representative early vertebrate, it appears that (VH-diversity-JH) segments are associated with individual constant region genes that can differ at the predicted protein level.\r"

  ".W": "The alternative pathway of complement is regulated on the surface of homologous blood cells at the C3 amplification step by the membrane protein decay-accelerating factor, as well as by the plasma protein factor H. We have reported elsewhere that platelets from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria regulate the activity of the C3 convertase C3bBb, even though they lack decay-accelerating factor. We now report that normal human platelets contain factor H, which was released from the platelet in response to complement deposition or thrombin stimulation. Factor H was localized to the platelet alpha granules by immunocytochemical techniques. As determined by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, thrombin-stimulated platelets released approximately equal to 54 ng of factor H per 10(8) platelets. The release of factor H in response to complement or thrombin was inhibited by treating the platelets with metabolic inhibitors. Such inhibition resulted in a 3-fold increase in the activity of C3bBb. Platelets that released factor H bound only half as many molecules of radiolabeled factor B to platelet-bound C3b than platelets that could not release factor H. Treatment of platelets with anti-decay-accelerating factor antibody had no effect on the activity of C3bBb unless the release of factor H was blocked. Therefore, so far as we know, human platelets have a unique mechanism for the regulation of the alternative pathway of complement.\r"

At age 6 weeks, A- mice had serum retinol concentrations that were 46% of A+ controls. When immunized with a single antigen dose, these mice produced an antigen-specific IgM response equivalent to controls, but their IgG1 and IgG3 responses were sharply diminished (less than 30% of A+ controls). At age 8 weeks, A- mice had 20% of A+ serum retinol concentrations and less than 17% of A+ liver retinyl palmitate levels. Responding to a single antigen dose, A- mice produced approximately equal to 70% as much IgM as A+ controls. Their IgG1 response was less than 30% and their IgG3 response less than 3% of A+ controls. The IgG1 response kinetics were identical in A- and A+ mice. Diminished serum antibody responses in A- mice were attributable to fewer immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells rather than to a decline in IgM or IgG secretion rate per cell. Total serum IgG3 levels, irrespective of antigen specificity, were slightly elevated in A- mice compared to A+ controls. The inefficient clonal expansion of responding B lymphocytes and contrasting impairment of IgM and IgG responses observed in vitamin A-deficient mice are discussed with respect to a possible helper/inducer-T-lymphocyte defect.\r"

However, to be maximally successful, the treatment had to be initiated during the postnatal period of the AKR mouse, encompassing a narrow window representing approximately the first 3 days of life. In the present study we sought to extend this barrier by including antibodies directed against a second envelope component of the virion, the transmembrane protein, p15E. We demonstrate that although neither antibodies to gp71 nor antibodies to p15E could influence the course of leukemia development when applied individually later in life, a combination of the two antibodies was effective even if given as late as 5 months after birth. The significance of these studies is discussed in relation to human retrovirus-associated diseases.\r"

By monitoring leukotriene excretion radioimmunochromatographically, it was shown that guinea pigs suffering from anaphylactic shock produce leukotriene D4 endogenously. Immunological challenge of animals sensitized to ovalbumin was accompanied by an increase of biliary leukotriene D4 concentrations from 10 +/- 1 to 86 +/- 10 nM (mean +/- SEM, n = 5, P less than 0.001). When considering that bile flow was decreased to about half after challenge, the excretion rate of leukotriene D4 in bile increased from 0.88 +/- 0.16 before to 3.18 +/- 0.38 pmol X min-1 X kg-1 after challenge (mean +/- SEM, n = 5, P less than 0.002).

On an equimolar basis, Alb-BR successfully competes with uric acid for peroxyl radicals but is less efficient in scavenging these radicals than vitamin C. These results show that 1 mol of Alb-BR can scavenge 2 mol of peroxyl radicals and that small amounts of plasma bilirubin are sufficient to prevent oxidation of albumin-bound fatty acids as well as of the protein itself. The data indicate a role for Alb-BR as a physiological antioxidant in plasma and the extravascular space.\r"

At 2 months of age, eight WHHL rabbits were divided into two groups. Group A (n = 4) was fed standard rabbit chow for 6 months. Group B (n = 4) was fed standard rabbit chow containing 1% probucol for 6 months. At the end of the experiments, average plasma concentrations of cholesterol were 704 +/- 121 mg/dl in group A and 584 +/- 61 mg/dl in group B, respectively. The percentage of surface area of total thoracic aorta with visible plaques in group A versus group B was 54.2% +/- 18.8% versus 7.0% +/- 6.3%, respectively. What was noteworthy was that the percentage of plaque in the descending thoracic aorta was almost negligible (0.2% +/- 0.2%) in group B rabbits compared to that in group A rabbits (41.1% +/- 20.2%). Low density lipoproteins (LDL) isolated from WHHL rabbits under treatment with probucol (group B) were shown to be highly resistant to oxidative modification by cupric ion and to be minimally recognized by macrophages. On the contrary, LDL from group A rabbits incubated with cupric ion showed a 7.4-fold increase in peroxides (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and a 4.3-fold increase in the synthesis of cholesteryl ester in macrophages compared to those of LDL from group B rabbits. Thus, probucol could definitely prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in homozygous WHHL rabbits in vivo by limiting oxidative LDL modification and foam cell transformation of macrophages.\r"

A molecular clone of Ab-MuLV (P160 strain) was transfected into the psi 2 packaging cell line, and helper virus-free Ab-MuLV (psi 2) was harvested from the supernatant medium. Ab-MuLV (psi 2) was as efficient as helper virus-containing Ab-MuLV (Mo-MuLV) in the transformation of primary bone marrow cells in vitro. Inoculation of weanling BALB/c mice with Ab-MuLV (psi 2) induced nonthymic pre-B-cell lymphomas with high efficiency and short latency (28 days). Adult BALB/c mice were less sensitive to tumor induction by a factor of 100. Ab-MuLV (psi 2) did not induce tumors in weanling C57BL/6 mice, unlike Ab-MuLV (Mo-MuLV). Examination of the proviral integration pattern in Ab-MuLV (psi 2)-induced tumor cell DNA revealed that each of the tumors contained a single integrated provirus. Immunoprecipitation of viral-encoded proteins in helper virus-free tumor cell lines detected the P160 Ab-MuLV-transforming protein; however, no trace of the gag, pol, and env helper virus-encoded proteins was found. Our results indicate that integration and expression of a single Ab-MuLV genome is sufficient for efficient transformation of primary bone marrow cells by Ab-MuLV in vitro and tumor induction in susceptible mice. However, the helper virus may contribute to tumor induction in weanling resistant mice.\r"

To identify mutations responsible for ADA deficiency, we synthesized cDNAs to ADA mRNAs from two cell lines, GM2756 and GM2825A, derived from ADA-deficient immunodeficient patients. Sequence analysis of GM2756 cDNA clones revealed a different point mutation in each allele that causes amino acid changes of alanine to valine and arginine to histidine. One allele of GM2825A also has a point mutation that causes an alanine to valine substitution. The other allele of GM2825A was found to produce an mRNA in which exon 4 had been spliced out but had no other detrimental mutations. S1 nuclease mapping of GM2825A mRNAs showed equal abundance of the full-length ADA mRNA and the ADA mRNA that was missing exon 4. Several of the ADA cDNA clones extended 5' of the major initiation start site, indicating multiple start sites for ADA transcription. The point mutations in GM2756 and GM2825A and the absence of exon 4 in GM2825A appear to be directly responsible for the ADA deficiency. Comparison of a number of normal and mutant ADA cDNA sequences showed a number of changes in the third base of codons. These changes do not affect the amino acid sequence. Analyses of ADA cDNAs from different cell lines detected aberrant RNA species that either included intron 7 or excluded exon 7. Their presence is a result of aberrant splicing of pre-mRNAs and is not related to mutations that cause ADA deficiency.\r"

Compared to carboxylated precursor proteins present in the liver, these molecules appeared to be unique to the lung. Antibodies raised against purified rat surfactant reacted with SAP resolved by NaDodSO4/PAGE and with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies in type II pneumocyte cytoplasm. NaDodSO4/PAGE of microsomal proteins, after carboxylase-catalyzed incorporation of 14CO2, demonstrated radiolabeled, immunoreactive products identical to SAP. The presence of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in these proteins was confirmed by HPLC analysis of SAP hydrolysates. Furthermore, lung carboxylase activity and SAP matured over similar time courses during fetal lung development. These results show that SAP are carboxylated by type II cells via a vitamin K-dependent pathway analogous to that for hepatic carboxylation of clotting factors. Further analogy to the clotting system suggests that gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in SAP polypeptides play a role in Ca2+ binding and thus in the known requirements for both the cation and SAP in the physiological function of pulmonary surfactant.\r"

The grafts developed blood vessels with laminin-immunoreactive walls and contained relatively high amounts of glial fibrillary acidic protein- and neurofilament-immunoreactivity in the neuropil after 4 months in oculo. Recordings of extracellular action potentials from the grafts revealed spontaneously active neurons with action-potential waveforms similar to those observed in immature rodents. Morphologically, the grafts showed no signs of rejection. Clusters and bands of large neurons resembling Purkinje cells and dense aggregates of smaller granule-like cells could be found in the cerebellar grafts. Large neurons were also seen in the cortex grafts. Taken together, these data suggest that the athymic rat may serve as a useful tool for studies of central nervous system tissue from otherwise immunologically incompatible species.\r"

The sequence of CaM-K alpha-subunit cDNA indicates a 478-amino acid (54-kDa) protein with three functional domains. The domain organization suggests a structural model for calcium/calmodulin-dependent and independent states that might subserve short- and long-term responses to transient stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Torpedo californica electric organ cDNA libraries were constructed in lambda gt10 and lambda gt11. Four acetylcholine receptor (AcChoR) subunit cDNA clones were isolated and shown to contain the entire coding region for each of the subunits. When in vitro synthesized AcChoR mRNA was microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, functional cell surface AcChoRs were expressed. A very simple and fast 22Na-uptake experiment was performed on batches of microinjected oocytes to identify oocytes that were expressing large quantities of functional cell surface AcChoRs for use in single-channel recordings. In addition to the transient expression system, DNA-mediated cotransformation is described, which is a method for stably introducing AcChoR cDNAs into the chromosomes of tissue culture cells. Because the AcChoR is composed of four different subunits, it is necessary to integrate four cDNAs into the chromosomes of the same cell before stable expression of a completely functional receptor complex can be established. We show that 80% of the cells that integrated the selectable marker gene into their chromosomes also integrated all four AcChoR cDNAs. When Torpedo alpha-subunit cDNA inserted into an appropriate expression vector was introduced into cells by transfection, alpha-subunit protein was synthesized that migrated on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels with the same molecular mass as native Torpedo alpha subunits and expressed antigenic determinants similar to those of native Torpedo alpha subunits.\r"

The resolution of this problem is hampered by the fact that it is not possible to investigate the biological activity of integral membrane proteins in the absence of lipids. However, certain characteristics of membrane protein function inhibition by anesthetics cannot be explained on the basis of an indirect inhibition by disturbance of the lipid bilayer and, therefore, most likely are the result of a direct anesthetic-protein interaction. This is the case (i) when the anesthetics competitively interfere with the binding of an endogenous ligand to the membrane protein and (ii) when the size of the anesthetic molecule is of importance for the potency and/or mechanism of inhibition. The present study shows that this is true for a membrane transport system, the Na+/K+/Cl- cotransport in glial-type cells.\r"

  ".W": "In the brains of humans and other mammals, there are two principal groups of cholinergic nuclei aside from those forming the cranial motor nuclei. One group lies in the forebrain and includes the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The second group lies in the hindbrain and includes the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (NPP), identified by Mesulam et al. [Mesulam, M.-M., Mufson, E. J., Wainer, B. H. & Levey, A. I. (1983) Neuroscience 10, 1185-1201] as cholinergic cell group Ch5. The basal forebrain cholinergic cell groups, which innervate widespread areas of the neocortex, undergo degeneration in Alzheimer disease and also in parkinsonism associated with dementia. We here report that the hindbrain NPP Ch5 cell group, thought to innervate many nuclei of the extrapyramidal motor system, the superior colliculus, and the substantia innominata, undergoes degeneration in idiopathic Parkinson disease and in the parkinsonian syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings strongly suggest that degeneration in the brainstem in Parkinson disease is not confined to catecholamine-containing neurons, but that cholinergic neurons of the NPP are also vulnerable. The findings further raise the possibility that certain symptoms of Parkinson disease and progressive supranuclear palsy have their genesis in pathology of these cholinergic neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibitory postsynaptic currents occurring spontaneously in the teleost Mauthner cell were analyzed with the single-electrode voltage-clamp technique. They were collected during depolarizing steps and were outward-going; this procedure allowed them to be isolated from possible excitatory currents flowing in the opposite direction. Their amplitude histograms were found to exhibit regularly spaced multiple peaks, each of which had a Gaussian distribution of the same width. These compound inhibitory postsynaptic currents represent responses evoked by background firing of presynaptic neurons, and when tetrodotoxin was applied topically, only the first peak in the frequency histogram, which can be attributed to single exocytotic events, remained. The mean conductance of this quantal unit equalled 46.0 nS, which corresponds to the opening of 1000-2000 Cl- channels activated by glycine--the transmitter at these synapses. Its waveform and those of the larger units were essentially the same. Furthermore, in each set of data provided by a given Mauthner cell, the size of a quantum was quite constant, with its variance and those of further peaks being equivalent to that of background noise. These properties, which characterize the quantal events on the basis of spontaneous synaptic activity, were strikingly similar to those of the basic units derived by the simple binomial to those of the basic units derived by the simple binomial analysis of unitary postsynaptic potentials, thus validating the use of this statistical model to quantify the quantal nature of release at central connections. The quite straightforward method used here to extract single miniature currents from complex signals should be applicable to the other systems of the central nervous system, where the pertinence of this probabilistic model of release has yet to be demonstrated.\r"

  ".U": "87289727\r", 
  ".W": "Changes in carbohydrate and polypeptide form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) have been documented during the development of central nervous system tissue in both chicken and frog. The carbohydrate variations reflect a high and low content of polysialic acid, and for the two vertebrates examined the expression of these forms is similar. At very early stages of neural development NCAM with a low content of polysialic acid is present, during histogenesis of the central nervous system NCAM with a high content of polysialic acid dominates, and there is a gradual return to NCAM with a low content of polysialic acid as the animals approach maturity. In contrast, the order of expression of the major NCAM polypeptide forms is different in the chicken and frog. These findings suggest that changes in sialic acid are a fundamental aspect of the function of NCAM in development, whereas NCAM polypeptide differences may affect events associated with a particular vertebrate. Studies have demonstrated that a decreased sialic acid content enhances the adhesion properties of NCAM. On this basis, we propose that NCAM with a low content of polysialic acid functions both to maintain integrity of neuroepithelium during morphogenesis of the early embryo and to stabilize differentiated structures in the adult, while the decreased adhesive function of NCAM with a high content of polysialic acid provides more plasticity in cell interactions during cell migration, axon outgrowth, and formation of neural circuits.\r"

  ".W": "Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis in Dutch patients is an autosomal dominant form of vascular amyloidosis restricted to the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex. Clinically the disease is characterized by cerebral hemorrhages leading to an early death. Immunohistochemical studies of five patients revealed that the vascular amyloid deposits reacted intensely with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide homologous to the Alzheimer disease-related beta-protein. Silver stain-positive, \"senile plaque-like\" structures were also labeled by the antiserum, yet these lesions lacked the dense amyloid cores present in typical plaques of Alzheimer disease. No neurofibrillary tangles were present. Amyloid fibrils were purified from the leptomeningeal vessels of one patient who clinically had no signs of dementia. The protein had a molecular weight of approximately equal to 4000 and its partial amino acid sequence to position 21 showed homology to the beta-protein of Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome. These results suggest that hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of Dutch origin is pathogenetically related to Alzheimer disease and support the concept that the initial amyloid deposition in this disorder occurs in the vessel walls before damaging the brain parenchyma. Thus, deposition of beta-protein in brain tissue seems to be related to a spectrum of diseases involving vascular syndromes, progressive dementia, or both.\r"

The binding of a fluorescent vasopressin analog (1-desamino-8-rhodamine-L-lysine vasopressin) to cells of the microperfused rabbit cortical collecting tubule was visualized and quantitated with image-intensified video microscopy and digital image processing. Binding to the basolateral membranes of a subpopulation of cells could be detected within 1-2 min of addition of the fluorescent analog (10 nM) to the peritubular bath. Binding could be prevented or reversed by the addition of a 10-fold excess of the native hormone, which indicates that the fluorescent analog binds specifically to vasopressin receptors. The time course of binding paralleled and slightly preceded hyperpolarization of the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage, an electrical response that is also elicited by the native hormone. Double-label experiments in which the intercalated cell population was stained with fluorescein-labeled peanut lectin revealed that binding of the vasopressin analog was localized to the remaining cell type, the principal cell. Our results support the following conclusions. First, the principal cell constitutes the primary target cell for vasopressin in the rabbit cortical collecting tubule, although the intercalated cell may possess a limited number of receptors at a density below the detection limit of this optical approach. Second, computer-enhanced video microscopy is a powerful, noninvasive method for assessing the kinetics and spatial pattern of hormone binding.\r"

To address this question, we subjected relatively pure (92% +/- 3% by factor VIII immunoassay) cultures of rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells to 0 to 45 minutes of anoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2), followed by reoxygenation (95% air, 5% CO2), to simulate ischemia/reperfusion. Cell injury was assayed after reoxygenation by the release of previously incorporated 51chromium and/or lactate dehydrogenase, and viability was determined by means of trypan blue exclusion. These three end points correlated closely. Without anoxia, the cells remained viable, with minimal evidence of injury for the entire experimental period, while 45 minutes of hypoxia followed by 30 minutes of reoxygenation produced substantial evidence of cell injury in 71% +/- 6% of the cells. This injury was reduced to 21% +/- 2% by treatment with the highly specific free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase together, either before anoxia or after anoxia, but just before reoxygenation. Similar protection was provided by xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol. The injury was mimicked (without anoxia) by the exogenous generation of superoxide radicals with xanthine and xanthine oxidase. These experiments establish the essential components of free radical generation at reperfusion to be localized within the isolated endothelial cell in the absence of neutrophils or parenchymal cells.\r"

We investigated the effect of isoproterenol and terbutaline sulfate on the development of acute edematous (AEP) and acute hemorrhagic (AHP) pancreatitis in a feline model of biliary pancreatitis. When given at the time of pancreatic insult, isoproterenol prevented the development of both AEP and AHP. Both isoproterenol and terbutaline sulfate reduced the severity of pancreatic inflammation, even when given up to 12 hours after the onset of AEP. Although neither drug was effective in treating established AHP, our findings suggest that, if given early in the course of the disease, they may be useful in preventing the progression of AEP to AHP.\r"

Uniform hybridization was seen with probes C7 (DXS28) and D2 (DXS43), which map distal to the DMD locus, and with OTC, which maps proximally. This deletion was present in six affected individuals and has been transmitted through 3 generations to date. On high-resolution chromosome analysis, a deletion within band Xp21 was consistently observed in one affected male studied and in one of the two X chromosomes in obligate carriers. This large molecular and cytogenetically visible deletion in affected DMD individuals without glycerol kinase deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a very rare finding and should prove useful in specifically cloning additional probes within and flanking the DMD locus.\r"

The following two hypotheses are proposed to explain the coincidence of the DMD phenotype and deletion of the DXS164 region in her offspring: (1) she may be a gonadal mosaic for cells with two normal X chromosomes and cells with one normal X chromosome and an X chromosome with a deletion of the DXS164 region; and (2) she may carry a familial X;autosome translocation in which the DXS164 region is deleted from one X chromosome and translocated to an autosome. The segregation of DMD and the DXS164 deletion in this family illustrates the importance of extended pedigree analysis when DXS164 deletions are used to identify female carriers of the DMD gene.\r"

The detection and identification of Y-chromosomal material in these cases can be of critical importance for medical management. Chromosome analysis in four patients with Turner syndrome revealed the characteristic 45,X chromosome complement together with a second cell population containing a small marker chromosome (46,X, + mar). Molecular-hybridization analyses utilizing cloned, Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences were performed to determine whether Y-chromosomal material was present in each patient. Three cases contained some Y chromosome-specific sequences, whereas one case was negative with all four probes that we used. These results were compared with detailed cytogenetic studies--including G-, Q-, and G-11-banding--of the marker chromosomes. In one case in which Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences were demonstrated, the marker chromosome was G-11 negative. These results demonstrate that cytogenetic analysis alone can lead to misidentification of some Y chromosome-derived markers. The combination of cytogenetic and molecular analyses permits a more accurate characterization of anomalous Y chromosomes and in turn provides additional information that can be crucial to the correct medical management of Turner-syndrome patients.\r"

  ".U": "87296015\r", 
  ".W": "We compared 609 haplotypes carrying the idiopathic hemochromatosis allele with 475 control haplotypes. Four haplotypes were more frequent in hemochromatosis: A3, B7 (actually A3, CW., B7, Bfs, DR2); A3, B14 (actually A3, CW., B14, BfF, DRW6); A11, B35; and A11, B5. The linkage disequilibrium for A3, B7 and A3, B14 (and probably also for A11, B5) was undeniably stronger in hemochromatosis than in controls. Two haplotypes--A3, B12 and A3, B15--were more frequent in hemochromatosis, without linkage disequilibrium. Four haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium in hemochromatosis--i.e., A2, B12; A1, B8; A9, B7; and A29, B12--were also found to have the same frequency and strength of linkage in controls. The dual observation (1) that haplotypes carrying A3 without either B7 or B14 were highly significantly more frequent in hemochromatosis than in controls and (2) that haplotypes carrying B7 or B14 but not A3 had the same frequency in hemochromatosis and controls led to the formal conclusion that only A3 is an independent marker for the hemochromatosis allele, B7 and B14 being involved only owing to the haplotypic mode of marking; the hemochromatosis allele can thus be mapped closer to locus A than to locus B. Our findings fit well with the hypothesis that the hemochromatosis mutation was a rare if not unique event that produced an ancestral HLA marking that was subsequently modified by recombinations and geographical scattering due to migrations.\r"

Ninety-six percent of 99 healthy persons including all 52 female controls, the 15 pregnant patients, and all 23 subjects with benign gynecologic tumors, had squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels less than 2.0 ng/ml. Seven of 51 (14%) patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 16 of 24 (67%) patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma had squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels greater than 2.0 ng/ml. Declining and rising levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen, which were determined sequentially in nine cases of cervical carcinoma that were associated with elevated pretreatment levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen, correlated with regression and progression of the disease. Serial serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen provide a noninvasive means of monitoring the effects of individual therapy in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "A new human retrovirus of West African origin (SBL-6669) has been isolated from a patient with immunological and clinical signs of immunodeficiency. Using radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA) and Western blot (WB) tests with human sera, the new virus isolate has been compared with HTLV-IV, LAV-II, and the HTLV-IIIB prototype strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The West African isolates appeared to be members of the same virus group since their glycoproteins were antigenically indistinguishable. West African sera showed no detectable cross reaction with HTLV-IIIB glycoproteins. The external glycoprotein in the different virus strains only showed minor variations in size. The size of the transmembranous protein was not unambiguously defined. In the West African virus isolates a 30-35 kD protein was seen similar to the protein previously described possibly to represent this component. However, in SBL-6669 a distinct 41 kD protein was also identified. There were interstrain variations in the size of several viral proteins among the West African virus isolates. Only minor differences were seen between SBL-6669 and LAV-II. The variations were most pronounced in two core proteins corresponding to the 19 kD and 24 kD proteins of HTLV-IIIB. In addition, West African human retroviruses appear to differ in pathogenicity. LAV-II and SBL-6669 are associated with immunodeficiency, whereas HTLV-IV was isolated from healthy individuals. Since further spread of these viruses to other parts of the world is imminent, it is necessary to consider their antigenic and immunogenic properties in serodiagnosis of HIV infections and in planning for immunoprophylactic interventions.\r"

We now demonstrate that there is an eighth gene which encodes a protein which is immunogenic and recognized by sera of some HTLV-III seropositive people.

An immunogold labelling technique was employed to study changes in surface expression of MHC Class II (Ia) molecules. In all cases, activation of LC was evident after as little as 15 min exposure and was characterized by a marked increase in surface expression of Ia molecules, prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and numerous ribosomes and lysosomes. Degenerative changes in LC were apparent to varying degrees depending on the allergen, its concentration and the time of incubation. Degenerative changes included swollen mitochondria, membrane disruption or rupture, loss of density of the cytoplasm (cytolysis), loss of dendritic processes and decreased expression of Ia molecules. In the case of dinitrochlorobenzene, degenerative changes were present and usually severe at concentrations greater than 10 micrograms/ml, while exposure to nickel sulphate and lead nitrate was associated with only mild degenerative changes. These observations indicate that contact allergens have a variety of direct effects on LC, including activation and degeneration, which are dose- and time-dependent. Since these alterations of LC were observed in the absence of other immunologically active cells, peripolesis cannot be involved in these events.\r"

One method to achieve this goal is amplification of globin genes transferred into the stem cells in the bone marrow of these patients. If the amplified genes remain normally regulated, they will then further increase their expression on being induced to differentiate along an erythroid pathway. To begin this study, we constructed a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene, a human beta globin gene, and a wild-type DHFR cDNA, and transfected it into mouse erythroleukemia cells. All the G418-resistant clones analyzed acquired and expressed the human beta globin gene. By serial passage of the cells in increasing concentrations of methotrexate, the exogenous human beta globin genes were stably amplified in all lines, and all increased their globin mRNA expression roughly proportional to their augmented copy number. Most of the clones further increased their beta globin expression on addition of an erythroid stimulus (dimethylsulfoxide). These results indicate that globin gene amplification may be useful in increasing globin mRNA expression in further experiments whose goal is gene therapy.\r"

When introduced into COS cells, the gene was expressed at normal levels with proper processing of RNA. These results suggest that the complete suppression of delta-globin chain synthesis in these patients is not due to a defective promoter, a defective RNA processing or a chain terminator mutation, but rather to impaired regulation of gene expression specific to erythroid cells. The region around the CCAAC box may have a significant role in expression of the delta-globin gene in erythroid cells.\r"

  ".W": "Surface transferrin (Tf) receptors are displayed by cultured human hematopoietic cells and provide Fe required for cell growth. Cell cycle status, cell density in culture, exposure to Fe, and differentiation alter Tf receptor display by myeloid leukemia cells. To investigate mechanisms controlling Tf receptor expression, rates of receptor synthesis and steady-state mRNA levels were measured in HL60 promyelocytic cells grown in serum and serum-free media or after differentiation in response to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Although surface binding sites were unchanged during the first three days in culture with serum or in serum-free media containing Tf, by the third day, rates of receptor biosynthesis and steady-state mRNA levels declined, consistent with cell density-dependent, receptor regulation. Cells grown with soluble Fe instead of Tf showed reduced Tf binding sites, rates of receptor synthesis, and Tf receptor mRNA. When cells grown with Fe were subcultured, Tf receptor mRNA levels increased within 15 minutes and peaked by 24 hours. This was followed by a decline in receptor and gene expression so that by three days cells grown in the presence of Fe expressed approximately four times fewer receptors and had half the rates of Tf receptor synthesis and mRNA levels of cells grown in serum or Tf. Cells treated with DMSO showed a rapid decline in surface receptors, receptor synthesis, and steady-state mRNA levels. Modulation of Tf receptor expression was not due to redistribution between the cell surface and an internal receptor pool. In each instance, concurrent assessment of N-ras transcripts showed that changes in Tf receptor mRNA levels were not due to generalized alterations in protein synthesis. Exposure of cells grown in Fe or treated with DMSO to cycloheximide did not alter Tf receptor mRNA levels, thereby suggesting that receptor expression was not regulated by posttranscriptional processes dependent on protein synthesis. Actinomycin D inhibition of Tf receptor mRNA was compatible with a transcript half-life of approximately 2.2 hours. Nuclear transcription studies showed reduced rates of Tf receptor transcription after culture with Fe or exposure to DMSO. The present studies show complex patterns of Tf receptor gene regulation in cultured myeloid leukemia cells and demonstrate that transcriptional regulation is a major mechanism controlling Tf receptor gene expression in response to Fe and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Toxicity studies using rodents have shown that the long-lived radium isotope radium 226 is about six times less toxic per unit of absorbed radiation dose to the skeleton than the short-lived isotope radium 224 with respect to the production of osteosarcoma. This difference in toxicity has been attributed to differences in the distribution of these isotopes. It has been suggested that 224Ra is more toxic than 226Ra because it decays on bone surfaces rather than within the volume of the bone mineral. However, in rodents many bone structures are small compared with the track length of the alpha particles and this explanation may be inadequate to explain the magnitude of the observed effect. Consequently, Monte Carlo calculations have been made to test the validity of the distribution-difference hypothesis. The results indicate that, for bone structures the size of those in mice, less than half of the observed difference in toxicity can be explained by considerations of the distribution of these radionuclides with respect to bone surfaces. Instead, it is suggested that the greater irradiation of trabecular than of cortical bone that is a characteristic of 224Ra is responsible for its enhanced toxicity.\r"

Of five patients over the age of 55 years given high dose Ara-C, four developed severe, irreversible neurotoxicity, but there were no severe episodes in nine patients aged 55 years or less.

Neurotoxicity at this total dose has previously been considered unusual. Administration of high dose Ara-C at total doses of 18 g/m2 and over carries a risk of severe irreversible cerebellar toxicity that increases with age.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas with particular clinicopathologic features occur with a high incidence in homosexual men affected by AIDS. More frequently than in the general population, these lymphomas have an extranodal location including the gastrointestinal tract. We have recently observed four cases of AIDS-associated lymphomas whose primary location is in the lower rectum and anus. The patients were 27 to 44 years of age, had greatly depressed helper-suppressor T-cell ratios, and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All four presented with anorectal symptoms and originally had surgery for anorectal fistulas or tumor masses. When staged, three patients had no other organ involvement, the fourth only had lymphoma in an axillary lymph node, and all four had large tumor masses confined within the rectum. In terms of histology, the lymphomas were of undifferentiated or of large cell type and of B-cell phenotype. Lymphomas with primary or major location in the rectum are a rare occurrence in the general population, and until recently, are rare even among the lymphomas associated with the immune deficiency syndrome. At the Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, no rectal lymphoma among the 58 cases of AIDS-related lymphoma diagnosed during the past 4 years was recorded until 10 months ago. The recognition of the new feature in presentation, a neoplasm associated with AIDS, is obviously important for its early diagnosis and treatment. Its unusual occurrence at the suspected portal of entry of the HIV infection is of interest because it may provide new clues to the association between AIDS and neoplasia.\r"

The seroprevalence of antibody to HTLV-I was evaluated in hemodialysis patients and healthy individuals in the ATL endemic area. The prevalence of antibody to HTLV-I in 13,329 healthy controls was 3.6%, compared with 19.7% in 949 chronic hemodialysis patients. The prevalence of hemodialysis patients was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than that in healthy individuals. Of 681 blood transfused patients who had undergone hemodialysis, 153 (22.5%) were seropositive, compared with 34 (12.7%) of the 268 who had not received the blood transfusion. The incidence was higher in dialysis patients who had been transfused than in those who had never received blood transfusions. Immune defects associated with uremia may have predisposed the patients to HTLV-I infection. Repeated antigenic stimulation from multiple infectious agents may have also played a role. The findings suggest an association between maintenance hemodialysis and HTLV-I infection, which can not be explained solely by blood or blood products.\r"

No recurrence of the leukemia was evident when the CNS tumors were discovered. Seventeen other similar cases have been recorded. The occurrence of second malignancies is reviewed in the context of this development and of the oncogenic effects of radiation. It is probable that prolonged exposure to IT-MTX may have had a synergistic effect with radiation in contributing to the unusual incidence of glial tumors in these patients.\r"

Study subjects, 93% with pancreatic cancer, 59% with hepatobiliary cancers, 23% with gastric cancers, and 13% with colonic cancers had serum Span-1 levels greater than 400 U/ml. Sensitivities of Span-1, CA 19-9, and Dupan-2 for pancreatic cancer were 94%, 85%, and 38% respectively. Span-1 in patients with Stage I pancreatic cancer showed a 50% positive rating but CA 19-9 and Dupan-2 showed only 0% and 25%. Although a positive rating of these three antibodies increased in advanced cases, Span-1 showed the highest positive rating. Span-1 reacted with colonic cancer tissues with Lewisa-b- phenotype. However, none of these tissues did not react against CA 19-9. From these results, Span-1 has a good predictive value for detecting pancreatic cancer compared with CA 19-9 and Dupan-2.\r"

Although we, and others, have found protein kinase C and its substrate proteins to be present in both membrane and cytosolic fractions in the heart, the physiologic role of this kinase in the regulation of cardiac functions remains unknown. In the present study, we found that in isolated perfused rat heart, administration of phorbol esters 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate(PDBu) and 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate(TPA), which are specific activators of protein kinase C, produced marked dose-dependent negative changes in inotropy and chronotropy. A dose-dependent decrease in coronary flow was also observed. The diacylglycerol analogues, 1,2-oleoylacetyl-glycerol and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, produced similar effects as the active phorbol esters on these isolated perfused hearts. An inactive analogue of phorbol ester, 4 alpha-phorbol, failed to produce any effect. Protein kinase C activity in both membrane and cytosolic fractions prepared from rat heart could be activated by TPA and PDBu at the same concentration range as used in the experiments with perfused hearts. Following perfusion of the hearts with PDBu, a rapid translocation of protein kinase C from cytosolic to membrane fractions was also observed. Our findings provide the first direct evidence that protein kinase C may play a potentially important role in the regulation of cardiac functions.\r"

In each case, the decision to treat must be based on the assumption that more good than harm is caused to the patient. This is a difficult situation for the physician. As long as there is no easy way of assessing the state and rate of progression of coronary lesions, the physician must treat the patient on statistical grounds only, i.e., rely on the results of studies showing that lowering serum cholesterol significantly decreases the risk of coronary events. Such evidence has recently been strengthened, which increases motivation for both physician and patients. The current general opinion is that drug therapy must be generally confined to those at high risk, i.e., patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. For individuals with moderately elevated serum cholesterol levels, dietary advice and correction of other risk factors should be adequate.\r"

The increase in SaO2 (percent above baseline, 5 percent RB and 6 percent NPV) was similar for both methods, but a greater fall in PCO2 (percentage change in PCO2, 3 percent RB; 15 percent NPV; p less than 0.05) was observed during NPV. Diaphragmatic and accessory muscle electrical activity was markedly reduced during NPV but remained unchanged or increased on RB. Asynchronous breathing was frequently observed with RB but only rarely with NPV. These preliminary results suggest that effective mechanical ventilatory support could be achieved with either RB or NPV. However, their long-term effects as compared with those of positive-pressure ventilation remain to be explored.\r"

The susceptibility of the stomach to develop dysrhythmia was measured by determining the median effective dose of four different drugs known to produce gastric dysrhythmia. These drugs were epinephrine, PGE2, met-enkephalin, and glucagon. The median effective dose for inducing gastric dysrhythmia was measured in four healthy conscious dogs by Dixon's up-and-down method during fasting and after feeding. The median effective dose of epinephrine, PGE2, met-enkephalin, and glucagon were higher after feeding (16.6, 16.6, 35.1, greater than 221 micrograms/kg, respectively) than during fasting (1.7, 5.2, 11.1, 61.0 micrograms/kg, respectively). The results indicate that feeding renders the stomach less susceptible to pharmacologically induced dysrhythmia. However, characteristics of gastric dysrhythmias, such as site of origin and direction of propagation, were similar whether they occurred during fasting or after feeding.\r"

Basal alkaline secretion showed periodic fluctuations reaching peaks at phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC) in the stomach. Mean basal alkaline secretion in healthy normals and DU patients averaged 1120 +/- 124 and 880 +/- 72 mumol/h, respectively and no correlation was found between basal and maximally stimulated gastric acid and alkaline secretion. Modified sham feeding in normal subjects and in DU patients increased this secretion to the peaks of about 28 and 36% of the maximal alkaline response to intragastric application of 16,16 dimethyl-PGE2 in these subjects. Vagotomy did not affect significantly basal alkaline secretion but prevented the rise in alkaline secretion induced by modified sham feeding. Atropine (5-20 micrograms/kg) decreased dose dependently basal, and prevented the modified sham feeding induced alkaline secretion, while pirenzepine (5-20 micrograms/kg) had little influence on basal, and did not affect the modified sham feeding induced, alkaline secretion. This study shows that basal gastric alkaline secretion fluctuates in phase with gastric motor activity, and is similar in normal and DU patients. Vagal stimulation strongly increases alkaline secretion, the effect being abolished by vagotomy and atropine, but not by pirenzepine, suggesting the involvement of M2 rather than M1 subtypes of muscarinic receptors in this stimulation.\r"

In the presence of exogenous arachidonic acid (AA, 30 microM), both steroids stimulated PGF2 alpha release by glandular, but not stromal, cells (P less than 0.001) and inhibited the metabolism of PGF2 alpha by the glandular fraction (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001 respectively). In the absence of exogenous AA, RU 486 and ZK 98734 stimulated the release of PGF2 alpha from glandular, but not stromal, cells (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). Neither steroid altered the release or metabolism of PGE2 when the cells were incubated with AA, but both RU 486 and ZK 98734 increased the release of PGE2 by glandular, but not stromal, cells when incubated without AA (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Both steroids inhibited the metabolism of PGE2 under these conditions (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that 1) antiprogestins stimulate the synthesis of PGs by glandular cells in early human decidua, but do not alter the synthesis of PGs by stromal cells; 2) this stimulation of PG synthesis involves an effect on cyclooxygenase activity and is not a consequence of increased availability of endogenous AA; 3) the metabolism of PGs by glandular cells is altered by RU 486 and ZK 98734; 4) as RU 486 has greater antiglucocorticoid activity than ZK 98734, these results suggest that both steroids act on decidua by antagonizing endogenous progesterone rather than glucocorticoid activity.\r"

All the HLA-DR or -DQ specificities detectable on the corresponding peripheral blood B cells were also expressed in freshly isolated SLC. However, in all instances, the number of DR-positive SLC exceeded the percentage of cells expressing DQ antigens. In addition, the epitope expression of Ia antigens varied within the DR or DQ populations of Ia molecules as revealed by polymorphic reagents. Double-label experiments or using the ingestion of Latex particles as a marker demonstrated that the synovial macrophages (type I SLC) primarily bear the DR+DQ+ phenotype, while there is an additional population of nonphagocytic SLC (previously termed type II SLC) that has a DR+ and monocyte marker negative phenotype but did not have detectable levels of DQ antigens as analyzed by both fluorescence microscopy and cell sorter analysis. This latter population frequently had a morphology showing dendritic processes and rapidly lost the expression of Ia antigens upon culture. Cells with a similar, primarily DR+ phenotype were readily obtained in synovial fibroblast cultures after treatment with Interferon-gamma. These data suggest that there are two populations of Ia+ synovial lining cells: the synovial macrophages (type I cells) with the DR+DQ+ phenotype, and cells probably related to fibroblasts with a DR+ phenotype without detectable DQ antigens (type II cells). The fact that the latter phenotype could be induced by Interferon-gamma treatment of cultured synovial fibroblasts suggests that this mediator may have a similar role in vivo in the activation of certain synovial cell populations.\r"

Since little is known concerning in vivo disposition of TGF beta, we performed studies to examine the hepatic processing of biologically active 125I-TGF beta in the rat. After intravenous injection, 125I-TGF beta disappeared from the plasma with an initial t1/2 of 2.2 min; partial hepatectomy delayed the plasma disappearance of 125I-TGF beta by 80%. 60 min after intrafemoral injection, 63% of the recovered label was present in liver and/or bile; by 90 min, most of the label removed by the liver (83%) had been slowly excreted into bile. Nearly all the label in bile (96%) was soluble in trichloracetic acid and not immunoprecipitable by specific antiserum. Colchicine and vinblastine inhibited cumulative biliary excretion of label by 28 and 37%, respectively; chloroquine and leupeptin each increased the amount of label in bile that was precipitable by trichloracetic acid and that coeluted with authentic 125I-TGF beta on molecular sieve chromatography. There was efficient first-pass hepatic extraction of 125I-TGF beta (36%) in the isolated perfused rat liver, which was inhibited by unlabeled TGF beta (but not by epidermal growth factor, EGF) and by lectins in a dose-dependent manner; prolonged fasting also decreased clearance (26%). After fractionation of liver by differential or isopycnic centrifugation, radiolabel codistributed with marker enzymes for lysosomes. The results indicate rapid, extensive, inhibitable, and organ-selective extraction of TGF beta by the liver. After extraction, TGF beta undergoes efficient transhepatic transport, extensive intracellular metabolism, and slow but complete biliary excretion of its metabolites. Liver fractionation studies and pharmacologic manipulations suggest that these processes are associated with organelles that include microtubules and lysosomes. The data suggest that the liver is a major target tissue or site of metabolism for biologically active TGF beta.\r"

  ".W": "We recently identified that the Y' bile acid binders are 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3 alpha-HSD). In the present studies, purified 3 alpha-HSD catalyzed rapid 3H loss from [3 beta-3H, C24-14C]lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids without net conversion to 3-oxo bile acids under physiologic pH and redox conditions. [3 beta-3H]Cholic acid was a poor substrate. The Y' fraction of hepatic cytosol was exclusively responsible for this activity and 3H was transferred selectively to NADP+. Time-dependent 3H loss was also seen in isolated hepatocytes. Further hydroxylation products of lithocholic and chenodeoxycholic acids lost 3H at the same rate, whereas 3H loss from lithocholic acid rapidly ceased, which suggests compartmentation of this bile acid in hepatocytes. Indomethacin inhibited 3H loss from bile acids either in incubations with the pure enzyme or in isolated hepatocytes. Indomethacin did not alter the initial uptake rate of bile acids by hepatocytes, but caused a redistribution of unconjugated bile acids into the medium at early time points (2.5 and 5.0 min) and that of conjugated bile acids at later time intervals (30 min). 3H loss from the 3 beta position therefore can be used to probe the interaction between bile acids and cytosolic 3 alpha-HSD in intact cells, and indomethacin is capable of inhibiting this interaction.\r"

  ".W": "[3 beta-3H, 24-14C]Lithocholic, chenodeoxycholic, and cholic acids were administered in tracer bolus doses either prograde or retrograde in the isolated perfused rat liver. Little 3H loss from cholic acid was observed, whereas with the other bile acids, 20-40% of the administered 3H was lost in a single pass from perfusate to bile. Most of the 3H loss occurred rapidly (5 min) and was recovered as [3H]water in perfusate. Excretion of bile acids was delayed with retrograde administration, and 3H loss was more extensive. In both prograde and retrograde studies, indomethacin markedly inhibited the excretion of the bolus of bile acid into bile. Indomethacin inhibited the extraction of glycocholate (50 microM) during steady state perfusion without affecting transport maximum for excretion. At lower glycocholate concentration (5 microM), indomethacin inhibited both extraction and excretion. A greater effect was seen on excretion in the latter case, which suggests that displacement of bile acid from the cytosolic protein lead to redistribution in the hepatocyte as well as reflux into the sinusoid. These data suggest that binding of bile acids to cytosolic 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases occurs extensively during hepatic transit and is important in mediating the translocation of bile acids from the sinusoidal to canalicular pole of the cell.\r"

It is also clear that the dental structures can still respond to the effects of L-thyroxine at a relatively late age, with the exfoliation of primary dentition and eruption of the secondary dentition. Impacted mandibular second molars appear to be rare. The lack of proper growth of the mandible and failure of normal resorption of the internal aspect of the ramus associated with deposition of bone on the external aspect with the development of normal-size teeth, resulted in a lack of space for the eruption of mandibular second molars. The impaction of the mandibular second molars in this patient seems to be caused by a dissociation of ramus growth and dental development, resulting in insufficient space for proper eruption of these teeth.\r"

The remaining 15,303 cases had been diagnosed as pathological entities. A majority of the oral biopsies were taken from either infectious or reactive conditions. Fibromas, periapical granulomas, periodontitis, mucoceles, and radicular cysts were the most frequently encountered lesions. Neoplasms constituted nearly 15% of all the specimens, with approximately 18% of these being malignant. An additional 360 lesions (2.4% of the total number of specimens) harbored dysplasia and might be considered premalignant. The peak age groups represented in these patients were the third through sixth decades of life. More oral biopsies were performed on females than males. A majority of the patients were white. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative frequency of oral lesions that were considered to be of sufficient clinical significance to merit a biopsy. Although this data might be used as a guide for forming clinical impressions about oral lesions, the clinician must always be aware of the possible occurrence of more rare lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies against human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) p24 and p19 were produced and employed in the in vivo expression of HTLV-I in some HTLV-I-related subjects by Western blot analysis. The antigenic determinants of these monoclonal antibodies were different from that of natural human anti-HTLV-I antibody examined. Serum p24 was identifiable in almost all of the overt ATL patients (17 of 18, 94%), but not in the chronic ATL cases or HTLV-I carriers. On the other hand, serum p19 was detected in one of the three patients with chronic ATL examined, but not in the overt ATL patients or the HTLV-I carriers. These results indicate that the in vivo expression of HTLV-I p24 and p19 which has reacted with natural anti-HTLV-I antibody can be detected by these monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, the investigation of serum HTLV-I expression may lead to the early detection of overt ATL in an HTLV-I carrier.\r"

In the present study, the expression of this antigen (termed AVID, for anti-viral idiotype) by murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells was examined during chemically induced differentiation. AVID expression by MEL cells was found to be lost when they were treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylene bisacetamide, two chemicals that induce MEL cells to terminally differentiate. The kinetics of disappearance of AVID during inducer treatment reflected the kinetics with which the inducers caused MEL cell commitment to terminal differentiation. Loss of AVID expression by inducer-treated cells was inhibited by dexamethasone, which inhibits commitment and MEL cell differentiation. The subset of inducer-treated cells that expressed the least amount of AVID contained the greatest number of cells committed to differentiate. These results indicate that AVID identifies a novel differentiation antigen of MEL cells.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and histamine in human skin was studied by intradermal injection of the compounds alone or in combination in healthy volunteers. Responses were recorded by measurement of areas of wheal and erythema, and changes in cutaneous blood flow quantified using a laser Doppler flow meter. The effect of a near-threshold dose of PGD2 on histamine dose-response relationships and on the response to a single low dose of histamine were examined. Histamine caused dose-related increases in blood flow and in areas of wheal and erythema in human skin. Prostaglandin D2 caused dose-related increases in blood flow and erythema area, but not wheal area, in the dose range used. When the compounds were injected together, PGD2 did not potentiate the increase in blood flow and areas of wheal and erythema due to histamine. The modest augmentation of histamine response in the presence of PGD2 could be attributed to summation alone. The role of PGD2 in cutaneous disorders such as the physical urticarias, in which its release has been demonstrated, is therefore uncertain. In the amounts measured in the urticarias, it is unlikely alone to cause a significant cutaneous response; nor does it appear to act by potentiation of the response to histamine.\r"

The primary lesions were managed by wide or radical amputation (26 patients) or by limb-sparing resection in 20 selected patients. The margins of the resections were retrospectively classified as marginal in three, wide in 16, and radical in one. The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) for all patients is 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43%, 74%) and overall survival is 78% (95% CI, 65%, 91%). The RFS for patients initially having a limb resection procedure is 55% (95% CI, 32%, 77%) compared with 62% (95% CI, 43%, 81%) for those initially having amputations (P = .52). Using multivariate analysis, the only significant prognostic variables that predicted RFS of greater than or equal to 3 years, were the presence of moderate to marked lymphocytic infiltration of the primary tumor (P less than .002), primary site outside of the proximal humerus (P less than .005), and the absence of a predominance of osteoblastic pattern in the primary tumor (P less than .03).\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-three children with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) entered the multicenter Pediatric Branch of the Italian Association Against Leukemia trial AIEOP/LAM 8204 between July 1982 and May 1986. Induction therapy consisted of two courses of daunomycin (DNM) plus cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Those patients who achieved remission were given four courses of consolidation with DNM, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and escalated doses of Ara-C followed by six courses of sequential continuation therapy using monthly pairs: etoposide (VP-16)/Ara-C, Ara-C/6-TG, and DNM/Ara-C. Periodic intrathecal Ara-C was used for CNS prophylaxis. One hundred seven (80%) children achieved complete remission (CR). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS) are 41% and 33%, respectively. Relapses occurred in 34 patients after 5 to 97 weeks (32 marrow; 2 marrow plus CNS). Overall, 14 patients died of complications during treatment (nine during induction; five during the postremission phase), mostly from infection. Risk factor analysis showed that induction failures occurred predominantly in children with French-American-British (FAB) M5 and in those with elevated leukocyte counts; by step-up Cox analysis, only FAB subtype was predictive of remission success. None of the variables examined was significant for predicting the duration of remission. Hyperleukocytosis was predictive of a significantly worse EFS rate. These results are encouraging and further support the use of intensive chemotherapy programs for childhood AML.\r"

  ".W": "A phase I study with continuous administration of epirubicin for 21 days using a venous access port and a portable pump was performed. The first dose step was 2 mg/m2/d for 21 days. Interval between courses was 3 weeks. Dose increment per step was 1 mg/m2/d. Twenty-two patients entered the study and received a total of 58 courses with a median of two (range, one to nine). Up to 5 mg/m2/d no toxicity (according to World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) occurred. At 6 mg/m2/d (six pts), one patient had leukopenia grade 3. Two others had some hair loss. At 7 mg/m2/d (four patients), all patients developed mucositis (two grade 3). Three patients had bone marrow depression (one grade 3 anemia, one grade 4 leukocytopenia), and one patient developed the hand-foot syndrome. No other toxicity occurred in the patients. One patient obtained a partial response (18 weeks), ten had stable disease (12 to 54 weeks), seven had progressive disease, and four were not evaluable for response. One patient developed cellulitis around the port, responding to antibiotic treatment; one patient developed a vena cava superior syndrome that resolved with urokinase and removal of the access port. No septicemia occurred. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. Plasma steady state was reached after 57 hours. During steady state there was a linear relationship between epirubicin dose administered and epirubicin level in plasma (r = .58, P less than .05), whole blood (r = .75, P less than .005), and in leukocytes (r = .68, P less than .05). The area under the curve in leukocytes was higher with continuous infusion of 6 mg/m2 for 21 days compared with bolus injection of 80 mg/m2. This method of continuous infusion with epirubicin may be a way to increase intracellular drug-uptake as expressed by intracellular area under curve (AUC). We recommend 6 mg/m2/d for 3 weeks for evaluation of antitumor efficacy in phase II studies.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the biodistribution of two radiolabeled, whole, tumor selective monoclonal antibodies [( 111In]96.5, [111In]ZME-018) to 67Ga in nude mice bearing a human melanoma known to express p97 antigen. Localization of gallium was determined 48 hr following i.v. injection. Localization of the radiolabeled antibodies was determined at 3 days and 7 days following i.v. injection. All agents showed more or less similar absolute tumor uptake which varied between 22% and 36% of the injected dose per gram of tumor. Only the tumor uptake of [111In]96.5 antibody at 7 days was significantly lower than the 67Ga uptake at 48 hr. However, uptake in normal tissues was generally higher for both antibodies at 3 and 7 days than for 67Ga uptake at 48 hr. Therefore, the tumor-to-blood ratio for 67Ga was tenfold higher than that for either antibody, the tumor-to-muscle ratio was twofold higher. Bone was the only organ in which the tumor-to-organ ratio was consistently higher with radiolabeled antibody than with 67Ga. The tumor-to-liver and tumor-to-intestine ratios were comparable. Localization of the two tumor selective antibodies was greater than a nonspecific \"control antibody\" [( 111In]CEA) and change in specific activity from 0.17 mCi/mg to 3.3 mCi/mg did not influence localization. From these animal data it may be anticipated that tumor imaging with [111In]96.5 or [111In]ZME-018 will not be superior to imaging with 67Ga for detection of melanoma.\r"

Comparisons of tracings of the initial cephalometric radiographs, the prediction tracing and the six-month follow-up film showed great variation in the results both within and between the surgical subgroups. Generally, it was easier to predict the treatment results of alveolar segmental osteotomies, especially in the mandible, than of operations in which the whole mandible was repositioned. The results from Le Fort I surgery with or without a concomitant mandibular setback showed the greatest difference between the predicted and the actual outcome. The postoperative vertical dimension appeared to be particularly hard to predict. Explanations for these discrepancies are offered and possibilities for improvements suggested. It is concluded that prediction tracings are still of value despite the poor accuracy in some cases.\r"

The epidemiology of the HIV, the technical characteristics of tests for antibodies to HIV, and the logistic, economic, and legal implications of such a program were considered. In one year, universal premarital screening in the United States currently would detect fewer than one tenth of 1% of HIV-infected individuals at a cost of substantially more than +100 million. More than 100 infected individuals would be told that they were probably not infected, and there would likely be more than 350 false-positive results. Public education, counseling of individuals, and discretionary testing can be important tools in reducing the spread of HIV infection, but mandatory premarital screening in a population with a low prevalence of infection is a relatively ineffective and inefficient use of resources.\r"

MAb 528 reacted with all epidermoid (22/22) and large-cell (4/4) lung carcinomas evaluated. The antibody was also positive with a subset of lung adenocarcinomas (13/21) and did not react with small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) (0/9). MAb 528 also stained normal bronchial epithelium identified within the tumor sections of 5 cases. Thus EGFR was expressed by all epidermoid and large-cell lung carcinomas examined, a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, and normal bronchial epithelium. EGFR expression was not identified in any of the SCLCs tested. These data imply that immunohistochemical detection of EGFR expression may find future application in distinguishing epidermoid, large-cell, and some adenocarcinomas of the lung from SCLCs.\r"

These UADT squamous cancers have a clearly definable high-risk group (smokers, greater than or equal to 40 yr), known etiology (tobacco and alcohol), identifiable premalignant lesions, a high prevalence rate worldwide, and high curability with \"early\" diagnosis. However, a need exists for an efficient detection examination suitable for physicians and dentists alike. Such an examination was designed and field tested as a feasibility study. The examination consisted of a six-step, dentist-oriented, site-targeted, 10-minute procedure, including the use of a fiberoptic pharyngoscope. Two practicing dentists were instructed in the procedure and used it on a randomly selected, high-risk Health America, Inc.--Park DuValle Community Health Center population, who were voluntary responders to a questionnaire and a phone call. Analysis of results showed easy and reproducible teachability, a high degree of acceptance by dentists and examinees, accuracy, and low cost. Associated findings were the following: Of 6,206 respondents, ages 40 and over, 27% were current smokers; 29% were ex-smokers; and 33% never smoked. Of invited current and ex-smokers, ages 40 and over, 51% appeared for a single examination. Compliance emerged as the major problem. The feasibility demonstrated in this study appears to justify a larger, controlled investigation.\r"

The industrial area of northern Contra Costa County (CA) was studied to explore a relationship between petrochemical industrial emissions and histologic-specific lung cancers. Finally, a suspected increase in the risk of congenital cardiac defects possibly related to pollution of the Santa Clara County (CA) water supply was investigated. No evidence of elevated risk of disease was found to be associated with either the Rocky Flats Facility or the polluted water of Santa Clara County. An increase in lung cancer, found by other investigators in earlier years, was shown to persist in association with industrial emissions in Contra Costa County.\r"

However, in the pancreas little is known about BGS expression by normal or malignant tissue. The present immunohistochemical study analyzed simultaneously the expression of A, B, H, Lewisa (Lea), and Lewisb (Leb) antigens in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma (primary and metastatic). In normal pancreas all five antigens were expressed in ducts, ductules, and acini, but not in islets. Acinar cells expressed A, B, H, and Leb in supranuclear cytoplasm, whereas Lea was found mainly on centroacinar cells. Only BGSs that were appropriate for the host's blood type were expressed, except for one case of Lea deletion. BGS expression by chronic pancreatitis tissue closely resembled that by normal tissue. In primary pancreatic cancer two cancer-associated alterations were noted that were not found in either normal pancreas or chronic pancreatitis. Deletion of an expected A, B, H, or Leb antigen occurred in approximately 25% of cases, particularly in more poorly differentiated cancers. Incompatible expression of an unexpected A or B antigen occurred in 33% of cases, regardless of degree of differentiation. Metastatic pancreatic cancers also exhibited BGS deletion and incompatibility. In both primary and metastatic cancers the incidence of incompatible A or B expression was higher in cancers from the United States than in cancers from Japan, but the incidence of BGS deletion was similar between the two countries. It was concluded that deletion of A, B, H, or Leb antigens and incompatible expression of A or B antigens are cancer-associated events in the pancreas.\r"

Control cases were selected from patients with unicentric lung cancer (ULC) with a longer survival time than that for other patients with whom they were matched for age, sex, histologic examination of primary lung cancer, and residence in prefecture. The overall percentage of MPLC was higher in males (3.1%) than in females (1.8%). Of the total number of cases, 46 were synchronous and 26, metachronous. The same histology was recognized in 38 cases (53%), and squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 65% of MPLC cases, all of whom were smokers. At least half of the MPLC found in nonsmokers were adenocarcinomas. Habitual smokers, with a Brinkman index (BI) of more than 50, accounted for 90% of all cases of MPLC, although 81% of the controls were also habitual smokers. A positive relationship dependent on the number of cigarettes smoked was observed between the BI of smokers and the proportion suffering MPLC. There was a family history of cancer in 47% of MPLC cases while, for controls, this figure was 40%. It was found that 67% of patients with MPLC and 61% with ULC were drinkers. The influence of cigarette smoking on MPLC was confirmed, especially in the cases of squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma.\r"

Pathologic diagnosis of incident cancer was confirmed in 643 persons (56 lung, 110 colon, 59 bladder, 93 prostate, 123 female breast, and 202 cancers of other sites). Our study found little indication that increased intake of vitamin A or beta-carotene from the diet or supplements protects against the development of cancer overall. Dietary vitamin A intake was highly associated with smoking status; 25% of current smokers were in the highest third of dietary vitamin A consumption versus 32% of past smokers and 36% of never-smokers. In males who never smoked there was some indication that cancer rates decreased with increasing vitamin A intake, but the results were not statistically significant.\r"

In comparison with the 1- and 5-year survival rates following the diagnosis of cancer for non-Hispanic whites, those for American Indians were generally poorer and, to a lesser extent, those for Hispanics were also poorer. The American Indian and Hispanic patients tended to have more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, although this pattern was not consistent across all sites. For many primary cancer sites, American Indian patients were less likely to receive treatment for their cancer than were non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics were also less likely to be treated for cancers of some sites, although the differences were not as large as for American Indians. However, after adjustment for stage and treatment, American Indians demonstrated significantly poorer survival than non-Hispanic whites for cancers of many sites. After adjustment for stage and treatment, survival in Hispanics was generally comparable to that in non-Hispanic whites.\r"

This cohort is derived from adults (greater than or equal to 25 yr) examined in the NHANES I (1970-75) cross-sectional survey of the U.S. population and provides a mean follow-up time of 10 years. An analytic sample of 5,485 women, including 99 breast cancer cases (34 premenopausal and 65 postmenopausal at NHANES I baseline), was examined for associations with dietary intake of fat, percent energy from fat, total energy, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and cholesterol on the basis of a 24-hour recall administered at the baseline NHANES I examination. No significant differences in dietary fat intake between cases and noncases were evident when mean intakes for each group were compared. For total fat (g) and saturated fat (g), a significant inverse association was indicated in proportional hazards analyses. Adjustment of fat for total energy intake resulted in a smaller effect that was no longer statistically significant. Adjustment for accepted breast cancer risk factors did not change these findings. This prospective study of a sample from the U.S. population does not support the hypothesis that high dietary fat intake increases breast cancer risk. Indeed, some lower risk associated with high fat intake may be indicated, although this result may be influenced by methodologic problems with the dietary assessment.\r"

These criteria concern the consistency, strength, and temporal relationships of possible causative associations and also require the existence of a biologic gradient and examine the extent to which the proposed causal association is in keeping with other biological and epidemiological knowledge. The published reports were inconsistent in their ability to detect a significant association between dietary fat and breast cancer risk, correlation studies that examined the effect of fat over large ranges being largely positive, and studies with stronger designs (case-control, cohort) that examined fat intake over much smaller ranges being largely negative. It was postulated that methodologic limitations associated with the design of the latter studies, in particular the small ranges of fat intake examined and inaccuracies in the measurement of fat intake, may have obscured any relationships between dietary fat and breast cancer that did exist. The remaining criteria, with the exception of temporality and epidemiological coherence, were not satisfied. Insufficient evidence existed to conclude a causal association existed between dietary fat and breast cancer risk in humans. A need for further study was identified in several areas, and it was concluded that intervention studies that examined the effect of fat over large ranges were most likely to yield the information required to determine whether dietary fat intake was causally related to breast cancer risk.\r"

The frequency of nuclear aberrations (NAs) was examined in the distal colonic crypts in DMH-sensitive A/J mice and relatively DMH-resistant C57BL/6J mice before and after a single exposure to DMH. NAs, mitotic figures, and crypt column heights were scored for all animals as a function of time following administration of DMH. In both strains there was a significant increase in the absolute and relative frequency of NAs by 12 hours, with a corresponding drop and subsequent overshoot in the mitotic index by 48 hours after DMH. The temporal changes in crypt column height correlate closely with the temporal changes in frequency of NAs in both strains. The results showed that both inbred strains respond to acute DMH exposure in a similar and parallel fashion over time. It was concluded that the NA index assay is a sensitive method for detecting early DMH exposure. However, this assay does not relate to ultimate outcome after chronic DMH exposure and should not be used as a predictor of eventual neoplastic transformation of colonic mucosa with this carcinogen.\r"

  ".W": "A membrane stabilizer, the biscoclaurine alkaloid cepharanthine markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity of vincristine (VCR) and adriamycin in cultured L1210 cells at a noncytotoxic dose. When 0.1-0.5 micrograms cepharanthine/ml was added along with VCR to L1210 cells in vitro, the cytotoxicity of VCR was potentiated 1.5-fold to 7-fold, whereas such potentiation was not found in mitomycin C, bleomycin, and 5-fluorouracil. The potentiating action of cepharanthine was stronger when the cells were preincubated with cepharanthine prior to the treatment of cells with VCR and cepharanthine, suggesting that a long-term contact with cells is required for the enhancement. Cepharanthine was found to induce the increase of the cellular level of VCR in L1210 cultured cells. It was suggested that the accumulation of VCR is due to the inhibition of a VCR efflux function of the cells. The administration of cepharanthine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 10 days with VCR significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of VCR in L1210 leukemia and P388 leukemia (P less than .025). However, the combined effect of cepharanthine and VCR in this regimen was marginal synergism. When the same dose of cepharanthine was administered in split administration, three times daily for 10 days, the therapeutic effect of VCR was further enhanced compared to its effect under the former regimen. Furthermore, cepharanthine was found to partially overcome the resistance of VCR in P388/VCR.\r"

  ".W": "Diethylnitrosamine (CAS: 55-18-5)-transformed 72/22 rat hepatic tumor cells undergo marked cytoarchitectural changes during exposure to sodium butyrate in vitro. Butyrate treatment of this cell line resulted in an increased cell size, volume, and protein content and in structural reorganization within both the intermediate filament and microfilament networks resulting in the generation of a more normal appearing hepatocytic phenotype. Induced changes in the microfilament system involved the accumulation of F-actin at the cellular margins in the form of a peripheral band and in the development of an extensive, predominantly centralized network of thickened cytoplasmic filament bundles. Such butyrate-induced changes in hepatic tumor cellular morphology and microfilament organization were reflected in a 26-51% increase in the amount of cytoskeletal-associated actin in 72/22 cells, as determined by flow cytofluorimetry of permeabilized intact cells or by scanning densitometry of the electrophoretically separated, detergent-resistant cytoskeletal protein fraction, respectively. It is unlikely that this increase in cellular microfilament content was due to a direct effect of butyrate on actin polymerization per se since butyrate (in final concentrations equal to that used in culture) did not alter either actin monomer-polymer transitions or the nucleation reaction in a defined in vitro polymerization assay. The available data suggest that butyrate may regulate the synthesis or modulate the actin-binding capacity of microfilament-associating proteins in cultured cells. Butyrate-induced \"normalization\" of 72/22 cytoarchitecture was previously shown to be reflected in a reduction or loss in the expression of specific growth traits characteristic of the transformed phenotype. The experimental reversal of defined cytoarchitectural abnormalities and transformed growth characteristics of 72/22 cells by butyrate provided an in vitro model to elucidate both particular cytoskeletal events associated with epithelial cell transformation and the mechanism of action of apparent differentiation-inducing agents, such as sodium butyrate, on responsive tumor cells.\r"

In the carcinogenicity study, both sexes were administered the chemical at dietary levels of 0 (control), 0.125, or 0.25% for 2 years. Toxic lesions were associated with phenylbutazone treatment in the kidney and digestive tract, appearing to have an adverse effect on life expectancy. Various tumors were detected in all groups including the controls. With the exception of pheochromocytoma in the female high-dose group, no statistically significant increase in yield of any tumors, including leukemia, was apparent in the treated groups of either sex when the data were analyzed by Fisher's exact probability and/or chi-square tests. Application of an age-adjusted statistical analysis revealed a slight positive effect regarding the occurrence of pheochromocytomas, neoplastic liver nodules, and leukemias in females. However, these tumors are commonly observed to develop spontaneously in this rat strain, and no such effect was apparent in the male groups. In addition, no differences in incidences of relevant preneoplastic lesions were evident between control and treated groups. Thus phenylbutazone showed no carcinogenic activity in DONRYU rats when given continuously in the diet for 2 years. For the investigation of promoting effect, phenylbutazone was given as a dietary supplement for 2 years subsequent to initiation with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea or N-propyl-N-nitrosourea. No enhancement of nitrosourea-induced leukemogenesis was apparent, although a slight promoting effect was demonstrated for renal and thyroid tumorigenesis.\r"

  ".W": "The origin of the medulloblastoma induced by JC virus (JCV) in golden hamsters was investigated by the in situ hybridization method. After inoculation of JCV into newborn hamsters, a few migrating cells in the cerebellar molecular layer as well as several cells in the internal granular layer hybridized with an antisense mRNA probe of JCV T-antigen on the 10th day. The number of cells positive for this probe decreased on the 15th and 20th days. Moreover, an incipient medulloblastoma consisting of many cells positive for T-antigen mRNA was noticed in the cerebellar internal granular layer 30 days after inoculation. About 6 months post inoculation, 95% of the animals had succumbed to medulloblastoma. Therefore, the origin of the medulloblastoma seemed to be the cells in the cerebellar external granular layer that were infected by JCV, that migrated normally through the molecular layer to the internal granular layer, and that began to proliferate to become medulloblastoma. When 5-day-old hamsters were inoculated, a few cells positive for T-antigen mRNA were detected in the cerebellum within a month. In the long-term observation, the ratio of medulloblastoma induction decreased as the age of the animals at inoculation increased. These results support the idea that JCV infects and transforms the cells in the cerebellar external granular layer, because this layer appears only transiently in newborn hamsters.\r"

Cellular immune response was determined before tumor inoculation; certain prostaglandin values in plasma and platelet aggregation were measured before and after tumor inoculation. Plasma prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 values were significantly decreased in those rats fed a diet containing menhaden oil. 6-Keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, cellular immune response, and platelet function were not significantly different in either one of the diet groups. Tumor growth in the groups of rats receiving the omega-3 fatty acids in their diet was significantly inhibited in comparison with that in the rats receiving the omega-6 fatty acids.

Several weeks later a frank erythroid leukemia develops. At the earliest stages of Friend disease there is extensive cell fusion involving erythroid cells but not platelets and granulocytes. Fusion was detected in experiments with allophenic (chimeric) mice whose component strains express electrophoretically distinct forms of the dimeric enzyme glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI). Infection of such animals with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus resulted in the rapid development of Friend disease. Concomitant with the appearance of early disease symptoms was the appearance in the red cells of the heterodimeric form of GPI, an unequivocal consequence of cell fusion. Platelet and granulocyte samples from the same infected animals failed to exhibit the hybrid GPI form. Furthermore, no hybrid dimer was evident in red cells from chimeric mice in which blood formation had been stimulated by phenylhydrazine treatment. These observations suggest that the occurrence of cell fusion early after infection by Friend virus is a significant aspect in the rapid development of neoplastic disease.\r"

Despite some empirical and theoretical objections, linear regression analysis of the relationship between plasma vasopressin and plasma osmolality or sodium continues to provide a simple and useful way to describe the major functional properties of the osmoregulatory system. Recent studies employing this approach have shown that the sensitivity and \"set\" of the system can be altered independently, indicating that they have different bases and control mechanisms. All factors known to alter the sensitivity of the system also produce a reciprocal change in sensitivity to the antidiuretic action of vasopressin. This association suggests that the existence of some as yet unrecognized feedback signal that links the regulation of vasopressin secretion and action. The \"set\" of the osmoregulatory system appears subject to modification by a large number of physiologic and pathological variables, some of which may act directly or indirectly by endogenous opioids. Even the solute specificity of the osmoreceptor is subject to change since insulin deficiency significantly increases the stimulatory potency of hyperglycemia. A fuller understanding of the variables and mechanisms that alter the various properties of the osmoregulatory system will enhance management of clinical disorders of water balance and other diseases in which abnormalities in vasopressin secretion may play a role.\r"

Osmoreceptor-mediated release of AVP is increased, but the response to volume stimuli may be reduced. The capacity of the kidney to concentrate urine is reduced by age, but this impairment cannot be correlated with coincident loss of glomerular filtration (GFR); there may rather be a failure of cAMP response to AVP in aging kidneys. Free water clearance is reduced in the old in proportion to the loss of GFR. Thirst mechanisms are also significantly impaired in healthy as well as sick old people. This combination of factors renders old people particularly liable to develop disorders of water homeostasis during episodes of acute or chronic ill health.\r"
