  ".W": "In the retrospective study reported here, we compared the longitudinal growth in three groups of children with thalassemia major who received a similar transfusion program but different schedules of chelation treatment. In those patients who initiated deferoxamine (DF) administration by daily subcutaneous infusion (50 to 80 mg/kg/day) simultaneously with the beginning of transfusion (at 8 +/- 6 months), mean height at 2 to 6 years of age was significantly reduced in comparison (1) with those patients who initiated DF subcutaneous treatment after 3 years at similar doses and (2) with those who were treated intramuscularly with small doses. In the patients treated at an early stage, those with more marked stunted growth had a clinical and radiologic ricketslike syndrome associated with joint stiffness. Mineral metabolism studies in these patients showed a reduction of hair and leukocyte zinc levels and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity. Our findings indicate that DF administration at high doses by continuous infusion before iron overload has been established adversely affects longitudinal growth. By contrast, after 3 years of age, even large doses (in the order of 100/mg/kg/day) did not result in growth retardation. The growth retardation observed may be related to chelation of other trace elements, including zinc, in the presence of low iron burden, to the direct toxic effect of unchelated DF by interference with critical iron-dependent enzymes, or both. These results indicate that in patients with thalassemia major, DF administration should be initiated only after iron accumulation is established, namely, around 3 years of age, after 20 to 30 transfusions, which are usually associated with ferritin levels in the range of 800 to 1000 ng/ml. At this age, deferoxamine doses should be established on the basis of iron balance studies and dose response curves. Doses higher than 50 to 60 mg/kg do not adversely affect growth but produce toxic side effects on acoustic and visual pathways and therefore should not be used. Longitudinal growth monitoring of DF-treated patients is warranted.\r"

Therefore we have searched for a specific anti-Reo-3 antibody response in the sera of patients with biliary atresia or neonatal hepatitis and for Reo-3 antigens in their hepatobiliary tissues. Sera from 23 infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 12 with neonatal hepatitis, 30 age-matched control patients with other liver diseases, and 55 control patients without liver disease were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for total (IgA, IgG, and IgM) anti-Reo-3 antibodies; sera of infants younger than 6 months of age were tested also for IgM anti-Reo-3 antibodies alone. There was no difference between either total or IgM anti-Reo-3 antibody levels in infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia or neonatal hepatitis and levels in control infants. Reo-3 antigens were not detected in the hepatobiliary tissues of 19 infants (18 with biliary atresia, one with neonatal hepatitis) by an immunoperoxidase method that readily demonstrated Reo-3 in control infected HEp-G2 cells. Our data do not support a relationship between neonatal liver diseases and infection with Reo-3.\r"

The intelligence of 116 study and 104 control children was assessed by both verbal (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) and nonverbal (Leiter International Performance Scale) methods. The prevalence of mental subnormality among the remaining 32 study children was calculated on the basis of psychologic assessments done outside our study, or school achievement, or both. Of the 148 study group children, 131 had been exposed in utero to antiepileptic drugs, most commonly phenytoin (103 exposed). The prevalence of mental deficiency in the study group (1.4%) was either the same or only slightly elevated in comparison with that in the general population. In the control group, there were no mentally deficient children. The mean intelligence quotients obtained at the 5 1/2-year examination were significantly lower in the study group than in the control group. There was no increased risk of low intelligence attributable to fetal exposure either to antiepileptic drugs below toxic levels or to brief maternal convulsions. In a few cases, there seemed to be a genetic connection between epilepsy in the mother and poor intellectual performance in the child. A high number of minor anomalies was associated with a lower mean intelligence quotient in both the study and the control groups. However, those features previously reported as typical of children of epileptic mothers, and those shown to be associated with phenytoin exposure in a previous phase of this study, did not predict low intelligence in the affected children.\r"

Although both patients had clinical and radiologic similarities, one patient survived for only 13 days and the other is still alive at 8 years. The most prominent pathologic feature was the marked degenerative change in the chondrocytes from resting cartilage. Fibroblast alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase activity was markedly reduced in both patients (approximately 10% of control mean); in contrast, dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity was only moderately reduced (50% of control mean). Alkyl and alk-l-enyl ether (plasmalogens) levels were very low in brain and liver. The accumulation of phytanic acid observed in plasma or liver was paralleled by a reduced ability of the patients' fibroblasts to oxidize phytanic acid. Our data indicate that the genetic defect in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata results in abnormalities in two apparently unrelated pathways (i.e., phytanic acid oxidation and ether lipid biosynthesis.\r"

The infants had been born with a mean gestational age of 27.6 weeks and a mean birth weight of 0.88 kg. Study weight averaged 1.24 +/- 0.35 kg, and study age averaged 5.5 +/- 2.4 weeks. Requirements for fractional concentration of inspired oxygen averaged 0.41 +/- 0.15 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 0.93 +/- 0.02. The VO2 was measured by means of a commercially available analyzer through a flow-through circuit and pump connected to a hood or in line with the ventilator. Cardiac output was calculated by means of pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. Oxygen saturation was measured by means of transcutaneous pulse oximetry. The coefficient of oxygen utilization was calculated as VO2/SOT. Transfusion consisted of packed erythrocytes (10 ml/kg). Oxygen utilization fell in all subjects after transfusion (p less than 0.01), but it fell more substantially in subjects with higher coefficients of oxygen utilization (r = -0.80, p less than 0.01), suggesting a physiologic benefit in selected patients, particularly those with higher levels of oxygen utilization. There was also a significant increase in overall systemic oxygen transport (p less than 0.01) and decrease in VO2 (p less than 0.02). Hemoglobin levels alone did not correlate with overall systemic oxygen transport, VO2, or level of oxygen use before transfusion, and thus did not predict which subjects would have a physiologic benefit from transfusion as reflected by falls in oxygen utilization.\r"

Tidal airflow was measured by means of a pneumotachygraph, and the transpulmonary pressure changes were determined by the esophageal balloon technique. Pulmonary mechanics and energetics were calculated by the least mean square analysis technique at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. Compliance was lowest at 2 weeks and subsequently increased linearly (at approximately 0.1 ml/cm H2O/wk). When compliance was based on body weight, however, no change was noted with advancing age. Resistance was greatest at 2 weeks and subsequently decreased. The infants maintained a normal minute ventilation with a slightly increased resistive work of breathing. Despite our ability to wean 53% of the infants to room air by 8 weeks, none of them had pulmonary mechanics considered normal for term infants. Infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) had similar patterns of pulmonary development. At 8 weeks of age, the pulmonary mechanics in infants with BPD who had been weaned to room air were comparable to those in infants without BPD, an observation that calls into question the rationale for defining BPD at 4 weeks in this population. These data suggest that such pulmonary function profiles provide evidence of persistent lung parenchymal abnormalities.\r"

In rabbit aorta, S-8307 competitively inhibited the contractile response to All with a pA2 value of 5.49 but at 10(-4) M it did not alter the response to norepinephrine or KCI. Similarly, a specific AII antagonism was shown in vivo in the spinal pithed rat model. In anesthetized rats, S-8307 did not potentiate the bradykinin vasodepressor response. In renal artery-ligated rats, a high renin model, S-8307 decreased mean blood pressure at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. as well as at 100 mg/kg p.o. In anesthetized rats, furosemide enhanced the hypotensive effect of S-8307. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system by captopril, saralasin or bilateral nephrectomy inhibited significantly but did not abolish completely the hypotensive effect of S-8307 in furosemide-treated rats. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin did not significantly reduce the hypotensive effect of S-8307. Our results identify S-8307 as a selective antagonist of AII receptors. However, at higher doses, mechanisms other than AII receptor blockade may partly account for its acute hypotensive effect.\r"

The increase in PG output elicited by acetylcholine (ACh) or arecaidine propargyl ester (APE), a selective M2 agonist was attenuated by both 11-[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido-[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), an M2 alpha antagonist, and hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSiD), an M2 beta antagonist. The coronary vasodilating effect of ACh and APE was inhibited by HHSiD, but not by AF-DX 116, whereas the vasoconstrictor effect was blocked by AF-DX 116, but not by HHSiD. The decrease in heart rate produced by ACh or APE was blocked by AF-DX 116, but not by HHSiD; however, the decrease in developed tension produced by the cholinergic stimuli was abolished by all these muscarinic receptor antagonists. The increase in PG output or changes in the mechanical parameters of the heart produced by ACh or APE were not altered by adrenergic receptor antagonists, phentolamine and propranolol, or by the nicotinic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium. The effect of isoproterenol or exogenous arachidonic acid to enhance PG output was not altered by these M2 receptor antagonists; however, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abolished the output of PG elicited by these agents or by ACh or APE. These data indicate that the effect of cholinergic stimuli to promote cardiac PG synthesis and decrease developed tension is mediated through the activation of both M2 alpha and M2 beta subtypes of muscarinic receptors. The cholinergically induced vasodilating component of the coronary response is mediated through the activation of M2 beta, whereas the coronary vasoconstriction and the decrease in heart rate is mediated through the activation of M2 alpha muscarinic receptors.\r"

  ".W": "A series of alpha adrenoceptor antagonists, including both reference compounds and the novel benzazepine antagonists, SK&F 86466 (6-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-methyl-1H-3-benzazepine) and two of its 9-substituted derivatives, SK&F 101253 and SK&F 104078, were tested in vitro for affinity at central and peripheral alpha adrenoceptor subtypes. Peripheral alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of these agents, as assessed by the receptor dissociation constant (KB) against norepinephrine-induced contraction in the rabbit aorta, correlated with the Ki value for inhibition of [3H]prazosin binding to central alpha-1 adrenoceptors in rat brain homogenates. Central alpha-2 adrenoceptor affinity, measured as the Ki for inhibition of [3H]rauwolscine binding to rat brain homogenates, correlated well with antagonist activity at peripheral postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors as reflected by the KB against B-HT 920-induced contraction in canine saphenous vein. The 9-substituted benzazepines, SK&F 101253 and SK&F 104078, produce preferential blockade of postjunctional vs. prejunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors in peripheral models. The high affinity of SK&F 104078 for postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the canine saphenous vein was confirmed by its ability to inhibit [3H]rauwolscine binding to postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors in this tissue. The observation that the Ki values for these antagonists against [3H] rauwolscine binding correlate with their KB values at the postjunctional alpha-2 adrenoceptors, rather than those at the prejunctional neuroinhibitory alpha-2 adrenoceptor, suggests a pharmacologic similarity between the postjunctional vascular alpha-2 adrenoceptors and the central [3H]rauwolscine binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The muscarinic receptor in the rat large airway was characterized by radioligand binding experiments. Using I-quinuclidinyl (phenyl-4-[3H])benzilate ([3H]QNB) as the radioligand, the receptor appears to be homogenous. The receptor density was 23 fmol/mg of protein and the Kd value for [3H]QNB binding was 16 pM. Competition of the [3H]QNB binding for the receptor with selective antagonists and agonists was used to characterize the muscarinic receptor. The K0.5 values for the (M1)-selective antagonists pirenzepine and telenzepine were 210 and 20 nM, respectively. The M2a-selective antagonist AF-DX 116 and the M2b-selective antagonist hexahydrosila-difenidol had K0.5 values of 130 and 120 nM, respectively. By comparing the apparent affinities of these antagonists in the large airways to their affinities in rat heart, the large airway muscarinic receptor appears to be of the M2a type. Agonists competition curves of [3H]QNB binding to the receptor were shallow. The agonist curves were modeled to one- and two-site binding models. All agonists, including M1-selective agonists, gave preferred fits to two-site models. Guanine nucleotide in the assay caused right shifts of the competition curves and decreased the apparent proportion of the receptor population that was in the higher affinity state for the agonists. Thus, it is concluded that: 1) the rat large airway muscarinic receptor interacts with antagonists in a manner which support the hypothesis that the receptors are of the M2a subtype and 2) both the high and low agonist affinity states of the M2a receptor of the rat large airways are capable of interacting with M1 agonists.\r"

  ".W": "It has been demonstrated previously that select Type II pyrethroids are potent proconvulsants in the rat and that the proconvulsant actions of deltamethrin are blocked by administration of PK 11195, an antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR). The present investigation has extended these findings to include various Type I pyrethroids as proconvulsants. Additionally, the proconvulsant activity of cismethrin was reversed by administration of PK 11195. Pyrethroid displacement of specific [3H]Ro5-4864 binding to rat brain membranes was investigated to further define the interaction of pyrethroids with the PTBR. Both Type I and Type II pyrethroids potently inhibited [3H]Ro5-4864 binding with affinities ranging from nanomolar to micromolar. The ED50 values for the proconvulsant effects of both Type I and Type II pyrethroids were significantly correlated with their respective IC50 values as inhibitors of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding. [3H]Ro5-4864 saturation isotherms performed in the presence of fixed concentrations of deltamethrin or cismethrin showed that these pyrethroids increased the observed Kd values for [3H]Ro5-4864 with no change in the maximum number of binding sites. However, Schild plot analysis of the effect of deltamethrin on [3H]Ro5-4864 affinity was nonlinear with the Kd shift approaching a limiting value. Considered together these results suggest an allosteric effect of pyrethroids on [3H]Ro5-4864 binding, and provide additional support for the involvement of the PTBR in the proconvulsant actions of pyrethroids.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of a thromboxane mimic, U46619, on electrolyte transport were examined in vitro using stripped segments of rat ileal mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers. Addition of U46619 to the serosal bathing solution elicited a transient increase in short-circuit current (Isc) and decrease in transepithelial conductance (Gt). The increase in Isc was accompanied by a transient increase in Cl- secretion and decrease in Na+ absorption. In the steady-state, Isc was not increased whereas Gt remained decreased and Na+ and Cl- absorption were inhibited. Removal of Cl- or pretreatment with serosal and mucosal indomethacin (1 microM) or the thromboxane receptor antagonist, SK&F 88046, added to the serosal bathing solution, inhibited the increase in Isc stimulated by U46619 (apparent KB approximately 8 nM). The effects of U46619 on both Isc and Gt are qualitatively similar to those resulting from stimulation with leukotriene D4. However, the changes in Isc with leukotriene D4 (10 microM) are antagonized by SK&F 88046 only at high concentrations (1-10 microM). In addition, the secretagogues prostaglandin F2 alpha, lys-bradykinin, serotonin and histamine, produce qualitatively similar changes in Isc to those seen with U46619 without altering Gt. With the exception of prostaglandin F2 alpha, the effects of these secretagogues are not inhibited by SK&F 88046 (10 microM). These results indicate that U46619 acts at a thromboxane receptor to stimulate intestinal Cl- secretion and inhibit Na+ and Cl- absorption. These changes are inhibited selectively by the thromboxane receptor antagonist, SK&F 88046.\r"

Moreover, data are presented demonstrating that the striatum is particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of Mn. Specifically, exposure to subchronic MnCl2 produced significant reductions in GSH-peroxidase activity in the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of the whole brain and the striatum. The decrease in GSH-peroxidase was most pronounced in the mitochondrial fraction of the striatum where the activity was reduced to 35% of the control. Catalase activity was also decreased in the striatum of rats treated with Mn but not in the whole brain. GSH content was markedly depleted (20% of the control) in the striatum, although only modestly decreased in whole brain (80% of the control). The alterations in the above parameters were accompanied by depletion of dopamine and dopamine metabolites in the striatum. The treatment of rats with Mn also decreased the activity of oxidized glutathione-reductase; the same treatment increased the activity of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. The activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase was not altered by Mn. The possible relevancy of the findings of this study to understanding the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity of dopamine systems is discussed.\r"

Drug studies were performed in three rats at 6.00% bovine serum albumin + 0% dextran and in three rats at 0.25% bovine serum albumin + 3.83% dextran. Chlorothiazide was introduced into the recirculating perfusate at an initial concentration of 100 micrograms/ml, and was assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Functional viability of the kidney was assessed by measuring the fractional excretion of sodium and glucose, and the glomerular filtration rate. The protein binding of drug in perfusate was determined by equilibrium dialysis. These experimental conditions resulted in an approximate 14-fold increase of percent free (from 5.3-72.0%), and a 3-fold increase of renal (from 1.03-3.30 ml/min) and secretion (from 1.01-2.83 ml/min) clearances. The data were best fitted by a model in which one Michaelis-Menten term was used to describe active transport, and secretion was dependent upon free concentrations of chlorothiazide in the perfusate. The maximum velocity of secretion (Vm = 85.6 micrograms/min) and Michaelis constant (Km = 2.1 micrograms/ml) of chlorothiazide was estimated using a nonlinear least-squares regression program. These results suggest that for compounds of low renal extraction, free drug concentrations are the driving force for carrier-mediated tubular secretion.\r"

The binding site was concentrated in the mitochondrial fraction enriched with cytochrome c oxidase and semicarbazide-insensitive monoamine oxidase. [3H]Ro5-4864 binds to the membranes in the mitochondrial fraction with high affinity. The dissociation constant (KD) determined by saturation binding was 2.8 +/- 0.7 nM (n = 5). The association rate constant (k1) was 4.7 +/- 0.8 x 10(6) M1 min-1, and the dissociation rate constant (k-1) was 0.028 +/- 0.005 min-1 (n = 3). The kinetically determined KD was 6.0 +/- 0.8 nM (n = 3) at 0.5 nM [3H]Ro5-4864. The density of binding determined from saturation binding experiments was 14.0 +/- 1.2 pmol/mg protein (n = 5). The Hill coefficient of binding was 0.94 +/- 0.02 (n = 5) indicating that [3H] Ro5-4864 binds to a single site. The [3H]Ro5-4864 binding was inhibited by Ro5-4864 (Ki = 6.1 +/- 1.9 nM), PK 11195 (Ki = 8.9 +/- 1.8 nM), diazepam (Ki = 87.3 +/- 3.4 nM), flunitrazepam (Ki = 94.6 +/- 1.8 nM), clonazepam (Ki = 6.3 +/- 1.3 microM) and Ro15-1788 (Ki = 16.8 +/- 1.5 microM). The rank order of potency of the competitive inhibition of [3H]Ro5-4864 binding (Ro5-4864 = PK 11195 greater than diazepam = flunitrazepam much greater than clonazepam greater than Ro15-1788) is characteristic of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site.

  ".W": "We demonstrated previously that aminocephalosporins, such as cephradine, possessing a alpha-amino group and a carboxyl group, are transported via H+/dipeptide carrier system in the intestinal brush-border membranes. The present study examined the transport characteristics of cefixime, a new p.o. cephalosporin with two carboxyl groups, by the rabbit intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles in comparison with those of cephradine. With an intravesicular pH of 7.5, apparent optimum extravesicular pH was 6.0 for cephradine uptake and more acidic (pH 4.5-5.0) for cefixime uptake. An inward H+ gradient [( pH]i = 7.5, [pH]o = 5.0) induced overshoot uptake of cefixime, and this uptake was reduced in the presence of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a protonophore. Cefixime uptake at pH 5.0 was trans-stimulated (countertransport effect) and cis-inhibited by dipeptides and aminocephalosporins but not at pH 7.5. Cephradine uptake at pH 7.5 was stimulated by the countertransport effect of dipeptide but not by cefixime. Cefixime and cephradine uptake at pH 5.0 was greatly inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic stilbene. These findings indicate that cefixime is transported by an inward H+ gradient via dipeptide carrier only in an acidic pH region, whereas cephradine is transported via dipeptide carrier in both neutral and acidic pH regions, suggesting the existence of multiple transport systems for dipeptides; a neutral pH preferring system (Type I) and an acidic pH preferring system (Type II).\r"

  ".W": "The oxidation of the beta adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol exhibits genetic polymorphism of the sparteine/debrisoquine (SP/DB) type. The alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol is absent in poor metabolizers, whereas metoprolol O-demethylation is only partially impaired, suggesting that an enzyme or enzymes other than cytochrome P450-SP/DB contribute to the latter reaction. Using inhibition by the quinidine/quinine isomer pair as a marker for the activity of cytochrome P450-SP/DB, the role of this enzyme in the in vitro oxidation of the enantiomers of metoprolol by human liver microsomes was examined. Unlike alpha-hydroxylation, only a portion of metoprolol O-demethylation showed the stereoselective inhibition by quinidine and quinine characteristic of in vitro reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P450-SP/DB. Furthermore, the kinetics of metoprolol O-demethylation were biphasic, the two components of O-demethylase activity being distinguishable by their enantioselectivity and sensitivity to inhibition by quinidine. Microsomes from one liver formed no detectable alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, and O-demethylation by these microsomes corresponded to the low affinity site observed in eight other livers. The rate of metoprolol O-demethylation by the quinidine-inhibitable high affinity component was directly proportional to the rate of alpha-hydroxylation. These findings support the hypothesis that cytochrome P450-SP/DB catalyzes the formation of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, but is only partially responsible for metoprolol O-demethylation. Such a mechanism could explain the previously reported inability to detect polymorphism in the O-demethylation pathway in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Membrane currents were recorded from voltage-clamped clonal (GH3) pituitary cells, using the whole-cell patch clamp method. Under conditions in which currents through Na+ and K+ channels were abolished, two distinct Ca++ channel currents were identified. Dichlorobenzamil (DCB), an amiloride analog and potent inhibitor of Na-Ca exchange, inhibited both the T-type Ca++ current (ICa,t) and slowly-inactivating L-type current carried by either Ca++ (ICa,s) or Ba++ (IBa,s). The blockade was dose-dependent (1-25 microM) and ICa,t was more sensitive to inhibition by DCB than the L-type channel currents. Although the inhibition of ICa,t was not accompanied by changes in the time course of inactivation of the T-type channels, the blockade of L-type Ca++ channel currents was time-dependent, increasing throughout the depolarizing test pulse (300 msec). Repetitive stimulation at 1.0 Hz or the application of depolarizing prepulses augmented the blockade of ICa,s and IBa,s by DCB. It is proposed that the blockade is modulated by the functional state of the L-type channel, being enhanced by the channel opening. Currents conveyed by Na+ ions through both types of Ca++ channels in GH3 cells equilibrated with Ca++-free salines were inhibited by DCB concentrations (1-5 microM) comparable to those required for blocking the currents conveyed by Ca++ or Ba++ ions.\r"

The mesentery of anaesthetized male Wistar rats was exteriorized and arranged for microscopic observation of the microcirculation in situ. Vessel diameters were measured with an image splitting micrometer adjusted to the phototube of the microscope. Images were displayed on the monitor screen of a closed-circuit television system. Topical application of PAF (10, 100 and 200 microM) enlarged the diameter of mesenteric arterioles and venules, which was antagonized by PAF antagonists administered i.v. (1 mg/kg) or topically (10 microM). Bolus injection (1 micrograms/kg) or perfusion (100 ng/kg/min) of PAF significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure of the animals and slightly increased arteriolar diameters. These effects were blocked by the PAF antagonists. Endotoxin (10-20 mg/kg i.v.) significantly enlarged arteriolar diameters and produced a significant drop of arterial blood pressure. These effects were blocked by the PAF antagonists at doses equivalent to those used to antagonize the effects of PAF. The leukocyte activator fMLP, as well as lyso-PAF and PAF antagonists, were devoid of effects on the microcirculation when applied topically or injected i.v. We conclude that mesenteric microvessels contribute to the hypotensive effect of PAF and endotoxin and that PAF is released at the mesenteric area during endotoxic shock.\r"

Total plasma drug concentrations in the fetus increased significantly with gestational age (r = 0.58, P less than .05), due to a concomitant increase in binding (r = 0.66, P less than .01). Fetal steady-state unbound drug concentrations were 50% of those seen in the mother, indicating that the fetus is capable of irreversible elimination of the drug. This ratio did not change with gestational age, suggesting that the capacity of the fetus to eliminate propranolol does not increase detectably in the latter part of pregnancy. The significant correlation between maternal and fetal unbound drug concentrations indicates that a major determinant of fetal exposure to propranolol is the clearance of the drug by the mother.\r"

  ".W": "A selective catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, OR-462, was studied for its ability to affect pharmacokinetic properties of L-dopa after the p.o. administration of the inhibitor to rats and mice. When OR-462 was given to rats at the dose range of 0.3 to 30 mg/kg in conjunction with L-dopa and carbidopa, a dose-related and long-lasting (greater than 5 hr) increase in striatal L-dopa and dopamine levels as well as a reduction in 3-O-methyldopa levels were shown. For a 50% reduction of the 3-O-methyldopa levels a dose of 6 mg/kg of OR-462 was needed. The increase in striatal homovanillic acid, an O-methylated metabolite of dopamine which poorly penetrates the blood brain barrier, indicates that O-methylation was not inhibited in the brain. In order to get the same dopamine levels in striatum the L-dopa dose could be lowered to one-fourth when OR-462 was added. The L-dopa-sparing effect of OR-462 given p.o. was also demonstrated in two behavioral parkinsonian models. OR-462 given at doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg in conjunction with L-dopa and carbidopa, dose-dependently potentiated the L-dopa-induced reversal of hypoactivity in reserpinized mice. Likewise, the same doses of OR-462 caused a marked potentiation of L-dopa-induced contralateral turning behavior in rats with unilateral nigrostriatal lesions produced by 6-hydroxydopamine. The data suggest a possible beneficial effect of OR-462 in the therapy of Parkinson's disease.\r"

Inhibition studies of the nondopamine [3H]haloperidol binding site in human cerebellar membranes revealed stereospecific binding and a pharmacological profile similar to that of specific sigma binding sites characterized in rodent brains using [3H]haloperidol, N-[3H]allylnormetazocine and di-o-[3H]-tolylguanidine as radioligands. The densities of sigma sites in the brain were highest in the cerebellum, nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex. A post-mortem simulation study was performed with guinea pig brains due to the concern that sigma receptors might deteriorate in the human brain before assay. The results showed that this site was remarkably stable and insensitive to long periods of cooling or freezing.\r"

  ".U": "89011472\r", 
  ".W": "In normal guinea pigs the adrenergic agonists clonidine and norepinephrine are known to inhibit directly the cortical outflow of acetylcholine (ACh) through alpha-2 receptors and to increase the cortical outflow of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through alpha-1 receptors. GABA, in turn, contributes to inhibit ACh through GABAA receptors. This scheme is changed drastically by morphine tolerance. In morphine-tolerant guinea pigs, clonidine at 7.5, 18.7 and 112 nmol/kg i.p. stimulates the cortical release of ACh through alpha-1 receptors. This effect is prevented by prazosin, 35.8 nmol/kg i.p. Clonidine reduces ACh release at high doses only (374 and 1122 nmol/kg i.p.). Furthermore, electrical stimulation of locus ceruleus also gives rise to a prazosin-sensitive increase in ACh release. In addition, locus ceruleus stimulation often causes behavioral activation rather than sedation. In morphine-tolerant guinea pigs, clonidine at 7.5 and 18.7 nmol/kg i.p. reduces GABA efflux through alpha-2 receptors, as the drug effect is prevented by idazoxan, 84 nmol/kg i.p. Clonidine increases GABA efflux at high doses only (112 and 374 nmol/kg i.p.). Locus ceruleus stimulation also gives rise to an idazoxan-sensitive reduction in GABA outflow. This new condition, evident after 7 days of morphine treatment, can be defined as inversion of the physiological norepinephrine control over ACh and GABA outflow and can represent a major part of the neurochemical derangement associated with opioid tolerance.\r"

  ".U": "89011474\r", 
  ".W": "The distribution of the central omega 1 (benzodiazepine1; BZD1) and omega 2 (BZD2) receptor subtypes has been studied autoradiographically in monkey and human brain sections using [3H]flunitrazepam (which binds indiscriminately to omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes) and [3H]zolpidem (which recognizes selectively the omega 1 subtype). Both ligands labeled an homogeneous population of binding sites (Kd values approximately equal to 1.5 nM and approximately equal to 5 nM, respectively) whose pharmacological characteristics were similar to those of central omega (BZD) receptors. Regional displacement studies in monkey brain showed that zolpidem was a more effective displacer of [3H]flunitrazepam from omega 1-than from omega 2-enriched areas. For example, it was 73-fold more potent in the cerebellum (omega 1-enriched) than in the dentate gyrus (omega 2-enriched). Zolpidem thus selectively recognizes omega 1 sites in primate brain. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam (omega 1 + omega 2) binding sites in primate brain was highly heterogeneous. Very high densities were observed in lamina IV of the neocortex (with higher densities in the occipital than in the frontal pole), the substantia innominata and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Intermediate densities were found in other neocortical laminae, cerebellum (molecular layer), claustrum, globus pallidus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus (granular layer) and the majority of thalamic nuclei. Structures displaying low binding densities included the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. The regional distribution pattern of [3H]zolpidem binding sites was qualitatively similar to that of [3H]flunitrazepam but the relative density of the 3H-ligands differed in several brain regions. The relative density of omega 1 and omega 2 subtypes in each particular primate brain region was evaluated by measuring 1) the ratio of [3H]zolpidem to [3H]flunitrazepam binding; 2) [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the presence and in the absence of 100 nM zolpidem. With both approaches, a preferential enrichment in omega 1 sites was observed in lamina IV of sensorimotor cortical regions and in the extrapyramidal motor system (globus pallidus, ventral thalamic complex, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra and cerebellum). In contrast, omega 2 sites predominated in limbic areas (e.g., the dentate gyrus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, cingulate and parahippocampal gyri) and in the anterior thalamic nucleus and caudate nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89011476\r", 
  ".W": "Recordings were made from convergent neurons in the lumbar dorsal horn of the rat. These neurons were activated by both innocuous and noxious stimuli applied to their excitatory receptive fields located on the extremity of the ipsilateral hindpaw. Transcutaneous application of suprathreshold 2-msec square-wave pulses to the center of the receptive field resulted in responses to A- and C-fiber activation being observed: 27.2 +/- 2.2 (mean +/- S.E.M.) C-fiber latency spikes were evoked per stimulus. This type of response was inhibited by applying noxious conditioning stimuli to heterotopic areas of the body; in particular, immersing the tail in a 52 degrees C waterbath caused a 74.2 +/- 2.0% inhibition of the C-fiber evoked responses; such inhibitory processes have been termed diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC). The effects of microinjections of morphine (0.6-40 micrograms; 2 microliter) within the 3rd ventricle on both the unconditioned C-fiber-evoked responses and the inhibitory processes triggered from the tail were investigated in an attempt to answer two questions: 1) does i.c.v. morphine increase tonic descending inhibitory processes? and 2) what are the effects of i.c.v. morphine on descending inhibitory processes triggered phasically by noxious stimuli? The predominant effect of i.c.v. morphine on the C-fiber-evoked responses was a facilitation (17 of 26 cases). Such a facilitation was dose-related in the 0.6 to 40 microgram range and naloxone reversible; it plateaued from 20 min after the microinjection. No clear relationship was found between the number of C-fiber evoked responses in the control sequences and the subsequent effect of i.c.v. morphine. Intracerebroventricular morphine clearly reduced DNIC in the majority of cases (21 of 26). Such a reduction was dose-related in the 0.6 to 2.5 microgram range and naloxone reversible; it plateaued within 90 min of microinjection. No clear relationship was found between the changes in DNIC and either the number of C-fiber-evoked spikes in the control sequences or the changes in the C-fiber responses induced by i.c.v. morphine. Autoradiographic controls using [3H]morphine showed a labeling along the ventricle wall including the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray matter and the floor of the 4th ventricle, three regions which have been implicated in the control of nociceptive transmission at the spinal level. Diffusion from the ventricle wall was over a distance of 0.5 mm and was identical whether observed 20 or 95 min after the microinjections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

With PDE isozymes isolated from rat (Wistar-Kyoto or spontaneously hypertensive rats), guinea pig, monkey or canine aortic smooth muscle, milrinone is a potent (IC50 = 0.16-0.90 microM) and selective (100 times peak III relative to peak I) peak III inhibitor. The potency of milrinone and other vascular peak III PDE inhibitors parallels their potency as vasorelaxants in isolated guinea pig aortic rings (r = 0.86; P less than .01). Vasorelaxation of phenylephrine-contracted (3 microM) guinea pig aortic rings is accompanied by significant increases in cAMP content or cAPK activation with concentrations of milrinone greater than or equal to 10 microM. Temporally, significant increases in cAMP content accompany significant vasorelaxation; however, activation of cAPK is not significantly increased until at least 1 to 2 min after addition of milrinone. Similar concentration and temporal relationships are seen with the cAMP-related vasorelaxants papaverine and forskolin. As with milrinone, a temporal dissociation between increases in cAMP content and increases in cAPK activity ratio is evident.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cell viability was evaluated by a vital dye exclusion procedure, and intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i was measured employing Fura-2 fluorescence. Exposing cell suspensions (10(6)/ml) to concentrations of the drug, which had no apparent effect on viability, produced a rapid and prolonged increase in intracellular [Ca2+]. The perturbation of calcium homeostasis could be blocked by the addition of mepiperphenidol, an inhibitor of the organic cation transport system. We propose that LLC-PK1 cells are an appropriate model to study drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Gentamicin disrupts calcium homeostasis and causes plasma membrane alterations. Since mepiperphenidol blocked the gentamicin-induced Ca2+ increases, the data suggest that aminoglycosides enter the cell via the organic cation transporter.\r"

Like the classic dopamine agonist apomorphine, R-(-)-NPA inhibited cell firing in both populations. Mean cumulative doses to inhibit firing by 50% (ID50) were 0.53 micrograms/kg for nigral and 0.50 micrograms/kg for VTA dopamine cells, respectively, reflecting a potency for R-(-)-NPA 10-fold greater than that of apomorphine for inhibition of nigral dopamine cells (ID50 5.3 micrograms/kg). Inhibitions elicited by R-(-)-NPA could be fully reversed by i.v. haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) but not by S-(+)-NPA in doses up to 0.9 mg/kg. Interestingly, S-(+)-NPA also exhibited agonist activity in both cell groups but with a much lower potency than R-(-)-NPA. In addition, VTA dopamine cells displayed a significantly greater sensitivity to the drug: ID50 values of 149 micrograms/kg vs. 514 micrograms/kg for VTA and substantia nigra neurons, respectively (P less than .01). Prior administration of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) consistently and fully prevented the inhibitory effects of S-(+)-NPA on all cells tested, although subsequent administration of haloperidol (up to 1.6 mg/kg) did not reverse completely S-(+)-NPA-induced inhibitions in all cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pilocarpine administered directly to the fetus produced an immediate change from quiet sleep to arousal. Neither the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep nor the latency to REM sleep was affected. Associated with this change in sleep-wake patterns, pilocarpine produced a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of fetal breathing movements. These effects of pilocarpine on behavioral states and breathing movements were blocked by atropine sulfate but not by methylatropine. We conclude that the increased incidence of breathing movements produced by pilocarpine are due, in part, to increased arousal at the expense of quiet sleep. As a result, the fetus alternates between arousal and REM sleep, and this behavioral pattern results in sustained breathing movements. In addition, pilocarpine increases the incidence of breathing movements in all three behavioral states. These effects of pilocarpine are mediated primarily via central muscarinic sites of action.\r"

Beta adrenoceptors were measured by quantitative autoradiography of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol ([125I]IPIN) to coronal sections of rat brain as well as the binding of this radioligand to homogenates of certain areas of brain. Administration of desipramine caused significant reductions in the total specific binding of [125I]IPIN in many areas of the brain, including regions of the amygdala, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and thalamus. This reduction in the total specific binding of [125I]IPIN was primarily the result of a reduction in its binding to beta-1 adrenoceptors in most brain regions. With the exception of the paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus, no desipramine-induced change in the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors was observed in any region of the brain. Treatment of rats with desipramine did not alter the binding of [125I]IPIN to the caudate putamen, globus pallidus or the cerebellum. Intracerebroventricular fusion of the nonselective beta adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, reduced the maximum binding site density of the binding of [125I]IPIN to homogenates of cerebellum and hypothalamus, but not to homogenates of cerebral cortex. Autoradiography of the binding of [125I]IPIN to brain sections from rats treated with isoproterenol revealed reductions in many subcortical areas and the cerebellum. In contrast to the effects produced by treatment with desipramine, reductions in the binding of [125I]IPIN after infusions of isoproterenol were a result of a decrease in the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors in most brain regions. Infusion of isoproterenol reduced the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta-2 adrenoceptors in 10 areas of brain in which the binding of the ligand to beta-1 adrenoceptors was not affected significantly. Inasmuch as there is a selective regulation of beta-1 adrenoceptors by the norepinephrine uptake blocker, desipramine, it may be inferred that these receptors are under the influence of endogenous norepinephrine. By contrast, the density of central beta-2 adrenoceptors are regulated more easily by an exogenous beta adrenoceptor agonist, even one like isoproterenol which is a full agonist at both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "This study assessed the blockade of hydromorphone challenge effects (cumulative s.c. doses of 0, 6 and 18 mg) during chronic buprenorphine treatment of opioid dependent subjects. Buprenorphine was administered daily via the sublingual route in ascending doses of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. Hydromorphone challenges were conducted after 10 to 14 days of chronic administration of each buprenorphine dose and 24 h after the last buprenorphrine dose. Buprenorphrine itself only produced dose-related effects in respiration rate. While subjects were maintained on 2 mg of buprenorphine, the hydromorphone challenge produced dose-related changes in physiological and self-report measures. As the dose of buprenorphine was increased, hydromorphone effects on self-report measures were attenuated to a greater extent than was noted for pupil diameter. The results of this study confirm previous reports of buprenorphine blockade of opioid agonist effects in humans and extent those findings by demonstrating both a buprenorphine dose-effect function and a dissociation between the potency of buprenorphine's opioid blockade for self-report vs. physiological measures.\r"

  ".W": "U-937 cells express receptors for leukotriene D4, and LTD4 stimulates receptor-mediated Ca++ mobilization with an EC50 of 5 nM. In these cells, LTE4 produces Ca++ mobilization with an EC50 of 500 nM and a maximum response that is 15 to 20% of the LTD4 response. LTE4 was shown to be a partial agonist, with a Kp of 400 nM and a linear relationship between effect and receptor occupancy, and was used as a tool to study LTD4-induced desensitization. Pretreatment of U-937 cells with LTD4 resulted in a concentration-dependent shift to the right and a decrease in the maximum of LTE4 concentration-response curves, indicating that desensitization had occurred. LTD4-induced desensitization was homologous for LTE4 and LTD4; Ca++ mobilization produced by LTB4, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-Phe and platelet-activating factor was not affected. LTD4-pretreatment produced a concentration-related desensitization of LTE4-induced Ca++ mobilization in both basal and dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated U-937 cells. However, the maximal desensitization was greater in basal cells (66% +/- 4%) than in differentiated cells (33% +/- 7%). LTD4 pretreatment resulted in a greater percentage of reduction of Ca++ mobilization produced by LTE4 than that produced by LTD4, suggesting that a receptor reserve exists for LTD4. The extent of receptor reserve was assessed in basal and differentiated U-937 cells by comparing LTD4 concentration-response curves from control and desensitized cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89011492\r", 
  ".W": "In order to establish the role of the Na+/H+ exchange transport on neurotransmission, we investigated the effects of amiloride and of 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride (HMA) on dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) release and on receptor-mediated modulation of DA and ACh release. Superfused rabbit striatal slices prelabeled with [3H]DA and [14C]choline were stimulated electrically in the presence and absence of several concentrations of these agents. Amiloride (3-10 microM) and HMA (0.3-10 microM) reduced the basal efflux and the stimulation evoked overflow of total 3H and of [3H]-3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and inhibited monoamine oxidase activity. The inhibition of stimulation evoked overflow of total 3H was blocked by pretreatment with nomifensine but not by sulpiride. Amiloride had no effect on the basal efflux and the stimulation evoked overflow of ACh or it did modify apomorphine-induced inhibition of DA and ACh release. However, at 3 to 10 microM, HMA enhanced the basal efflux of 3H; this effect was not prevented either by uptake inhibition with nomifensine or by low extracellular calcium. These results suggest that amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport and the amiloride and HMA-sensitive Na+/H+ antiporter play no role on the secretion of DA and ACh, or on the mechanisms by which activation of pre- and postsynaptic DA receptors lead to inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Amiloride- and HMA-induced monoamine oxidase inhibition accounts for the effects of amiloride and HMA on DA efflux and overflow. The guanidine moiety present in the amiloride and HMA molecules is most likely responsible for these effects.\r"

In contrast, the in vivo effects of a nonacetylated salicylate (SA), such as sodium SA, on renal function have not been well characterized. No studies have examined the effects of SA on renal function in a situation in which the maintenance of normal kidney function is dependent upon intact renal PG synthesis (i.e., sodium restriction-elevated plasma renin activity). To evaluate the effects of SA vs ASA and/or a NSAID, normal and sodium-restricted anesthetized dogs were treated with SA and then meclofenamate (MECLO) or ASA followed by MECLO. In the normal animals, SA significantly decreased renal PGE2 and PGF2 alpha excretion. After SA a significant amount of MECLO-suppressible PGE2 and PGF2 alpha synthesis remained intact. Compared to SA, with ASA there was a greater decrease in PG excretion, with no further decrease in PG excretion with subsequent MECLO treatment. In the sodium-restricted animals (plasma renin activity, 18-24 ng of angiotensin l/ml/hr) ASA decreased PGE2 excretion but SA did not. In these animals SA did not cause renal vasoconstriction. Additional groups of sodium-restricted animals were studied with extremely high doses of ASA and SA (90 mg/kg) to elevate plasma SA to 200 to 250 micrograms/ml. In these animals SA did decrease PGE2 excretion significantly, but only to levels seen typically in normal animals and, after SA, a large amount of PGE2 excretion could be suppressed by MECLO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The claims included were those in which an indemnity was paid or $1,000 or more was expended on the legal defense. Five obstetricians reviewed these cases to identify obstetric and neonatal risk factors. In addition, cases were classified as to the presence or absence of medical negligence. Most of the complications leading to claims arose during labor and delivery. Many claims resulted from the failure to evaluate or treat in a manner consistent with accepted standards of care. Many lacked documentation of the physician's recognition of the risk factors involved. Low Apgar scores at both one and five minutes were the newborn risk factors seen most commonly. In the opinion of the reviewers, medical negligence occurred in 47% of the cases. Indemnity payment occurred with most of the claims judged to be associated with medical negligence. Payment to the claimant was made in a number of cases in which the reviewer thought no malpractice occurred. These results suggest that improvements may be needed in prenatal and perinatal health care as well as in the legal system used to address the problem of perinatal medical negligence.\r"

One hundred twenty-eight had follow-up examinations that included Papanicolaou smears and ECC some time after evaluation and/or treatment for cervical dysplasia. Within an established protocol for the evaluation and management of abnormal Papanicolaou smears, the endocervical brush was compared to ECC. When the combination of colposcopy and cervical conization showed that dysplasia was confined to the endocervix, the endocervical brush was significantly more sensitive than ECC in detecting this endocervical disease (P less than .05). In follow-up evaluations and in patients with unsatisfactory colposcopic examinations, endocervical brush cytology could replace ECC without affecting clinical management. In patients with a satisfactory colposcopic examination, ECC may be required only when endocervical brush cytology is abnormal. Endocervical brush cytology is less costly and painful and could prove to be a reasonable alternative to ECC for the initial evaluation of the endocervix. Endocervical brush cytology shows promise as a safe adjunct to the colposcopic evaluation of pregnant women, whereas ECC is contraindicated in such women.\r"

Assays of estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and progesterone (P) revealed that: (1) there is a major concentration difference in all the steroids between peripheral and local values, (2) labor is associated with a significant rise in systemic and local E2 but no change in P, and (3) the increased production of E2 does not appear to be from a fetoplacental source. These data strongly support a modulating role for alterations in steroid hormones at the onset of human labor. The results demonstrate an increase in estrogen, rather than the classic \"withdrawal\", as the prime factor in E2:P ratio changes associated with labor and suggest that the source of the estrogen increase may be maternal rather than fetal.\r"

In spite of that the survival, stage by stage, is not markedly different from that of truncal melanoma. Traditionally it has been treated in the same manner as vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, with extreme but often therapeutically inadequate radical surgery. For lesions less than 0.75 mm in depth, wide excision with a 2-cm margin is adequate. Deeper lesions require radical local excision and bilateral groin lymphadenectomy through separate incisions.\r"

In each case, smears were taken using a spatula, a swabstick and the technique of scraping with a scalpel blade held perpendicular to the tissue after cleaning the surface with saline. The slides were then compared after the abnormal cells had been indicated on the coverslip with an ink dot. Only when the scalpel blade was used was the preparation suitable for diagnosis in every case. Used correctly, vulvar cytology has considerable application for the gynecologist. It permits rapid diagnosis and delineation of lesions and is useful in the long-term follow-up of malignant and potentially malignant conditions.\r"

The initial presentation of granuloma inguinale included large, fungating labial ulcers, labial swelling, vaginal discharge, rectovaginal fistulae and hematuria. Common presumptive diagnoses included carcinoma, herpes, syphilis and granuloma inguinale. The final diagnosis was made with cytology and/or tissue examination with the help of special stains to demonstrate the causative organism, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. Granuloma inguinale is rare and difficult to diagnose, but with physician awareness, cytology and biopsy, it should not be missed.\r"

Four hundred sixteen women had had previous abdominal surgery. One bowel injury occurred in this group. A patient without prior surgery sustained an intraabdominal laceration requiring further surgery and hospitalization.

  ".W": "Stress incontinence in women may have many etiologies, of which the two primary ones are detrusor overactivity (urge incontinence), which is treated medically, and anatomic (pure) stress incontinence, which is treated surgically. At the Ben Taub Gynecologic Urology Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine, 307 women were studied. Evaluations included history and physical examination, Q-tip test, catheterization for culture and residual volume, and CO2 gas urethroscopy with single-channel cystometrics. Twenty-nine percent of the patients were found to have pure anatomic stress incontinence, 33% to have urge incontinence and 38% to have combined urge and anatomic stress incontinence; 57% had irritative symptoms regardless of the etiologies. Cystocele was present in 92% of stress, 49% of urge and 83% of combined cases. Patients with anatomic stress incontinence tended to have larger cystoceles and greater Q-tip angles; however, a significant percentage of patients with urge incontinence also had cystoceles and abnormal Q-tip angles. Treatment must therefore be individualized on the basis of anatomic and physiologic findings. Of the patients, 40% were treated surgically, and 69% received some form of medical treatment, including antispasmodics, estrogen, Kegel's exercises, urethral dilatation and bladder drills; 9% were given a trial of medical therapy followed by surgical therapy. This practical approach to evaluating women with stress incontinence is easily used in the practitioner's office.\r"

In this series of 250 repeat tests there were no adverse outcomes in patients who had a reactive negative CST after a hyperstimulation pattern, suggesting that the second test can be performed in a week rather than in a day.\r"

While fetal cord sampling can be used to obtain rapid karyotypes, its availability is still very limited. With more defined media, the culture duration (CD) for amniotic fluid cells has decreased markedly. We investigated CD as a function of gestational age (GA) and karyotype and found that: (1) there is an inverse correlation of GA and CD; (2) aneuploid karyotypes, translocations and inversions all grow more slowly regardless of GA; (3) since late taps are performed most often on highly suspicious cases, the general impression of late-GA slow growth may be because of a higher likelihood of aneuploidy. Our data thus support increased utilization of third-trimester genetic amniocentesis in selected cases.\r"

In PMNL from a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, dexamethasone modulated the synthesis of the same polypeptides as in PMNL from a group of healthy volunteers, but the degree of response of their polypeptides to dexamethasone was significantly reduced as measured by assaying the level of synthesis of a polypeptide of molecular weight 16,000.

We retrospectively examined the relationship between serum creatine kinase (CK), muscle strength and the dosage and method of administration of prednisone in 30 patients with PM-DM observed monthly for a minimum of one year. Forty-two corticosteroid treated episodes of proximal muscle weakness associated with CK elevations formed the final study group. Each patient course was designated as having a good or poor biochemical and clinical outcome based on predetermined criteria. Adherence to 3 principles predicted a favorable biochemical and clinical outcome in the treatment of myositis: (1) administration of an adequate initial (loading) corticosteroid dose; (2) continuation of the initial dose until or after the time that the serum CK had become normal; and (3) a slow corticosteroid taper rate. Achievement of a CK within the low normal range predicted a prolonged biochemical remission, and a rise of CK within the normal range signalled a subsequent biochemical and clinical relapse. Tapering the corticosteroid dose when the CK was elevated frequently resulted in a further increase in CK. These observations allowed us to develop practical guidelines for the management of PM-DM.\r"

CPPD crystal deposits were unassociated with collagen or matrix vesicles. Second, and more frequently, large collections of randomly arranged crystals (agglomerates) were observed, the smallest replacing the chondrocyte and adjacent pericellular matrix. Chondrocytes adjacent to crystal deposits were intact. Coexistent apatite crystal deposition was demonstrated in only 2 of 23 cartilages ultrastructurally examined, providing evidence that mixed crystal deposits are possible but not common in CPPD crystal arthropathy.\r"

Auranofin (AF), a gold containing complex used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is a potent inhibitor of the macrophage respiratory burst. Ten rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium containing complexes were inactive in inhibiting superoxide production. The only active nongold organometallic complex was spirogermanium which had an equivalent IC50 for activity as AF. The inhibitory activity of AF, but not spirogermanium, was reduced in the presence of the sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiothreitol. This suggests that interactions other than those with sulfhydryl groups may be involved in the action of spirogermanium.\r"

Patients with resorptive arthropathy had severe radiographic changes. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of nodules, a positive rheumatoid factor or antinuclear factor and functional classification (American Rheumatism Association) in patients with resorptive arthropathy when compared to the remainder of the patients.

The questionnaire contained items believed to be predictive of future compliance, including patient self-predictions regarding future compliance, ratings of behavior in similar situations and barriers to compliance, such as ease of transportation to the clinic. Compliance was estimated via a salicylate assay that was taken during a subsequent outpatient appointment. Multivariate analyses of our data revealed that significant predictions could be made regarding future compliance, with 75% of the noncompliant patients correctly identified. Variables contributing significantly included behavioral self-predictions and a measure of current behavior in similar situations, as assessed by a salicylate assay that was collected during the 1st outpatient visit.\r"

Although granulomatous vasculitis has been reported as part of necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis, our patient was unique in the extent and type of her extrapulmonary symptomatology.\r"

She did not improve after treatment with prednisolone, fresh frozen plasma, antiplatelet agents, and prostacyclin, but a trial with vincristine resulted in a longlasting complete remission. TTP in autoimmune diseases probably results from immune mediated vasculopathy, which was demonstrated in our patient using nailfold capillary microscopy. Though TTP has many clinical and laboratory features in common with active MCTD, recognition of differences between the 2 conditions, i.e., microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and a negative Coombs' test in the former, is important because treatment in the 2 conditions differs.\r"

Of those, 175 (70 percent) of the medical school departments and 479 (58 percent) of the residency programs reported offering at least one curriculum unit on substance abuse. There was considerable variation among the four specialties in the number and percentage of departments or programs reporting such units. Overall, a majority of the units addressed both alcohol and other drugs, were required, and included a clinical component. Evaluations of content and teaching strategies are needed to examine the quality and adequacy of substance abuse training.\r"

Of 1,427 questionnaires distributed, 41 percent were returned. The questionnaire and distribution method were derived from an ongoing survey on drug use in order to permit comparison of the medical students with a national sample of age- and sex-matched cohorts. The rates of substance use during the 30 days preceding receipt of the questionnaire were: alcohol, 87.8 percent; marijuana, 17.3 percent; cigarettes, 9.0 percent; cocaine, 5.6 percent; heroin, 0.0 percent; other opiates, 0.9 percent; LSD, 0.2 percent; other psychedelics, 0.5 percent; barbiturates, 0.5 percent; tranquilizers, 2.2 percent; and amphetamines, 1.2 percent. Compared with their age and sex cohorts nationally, the medical students reported less use of marijuana, cocaine, cigarettes, LSD, barbiturates, and amphetamines. However, their use of other opiates was approximately the same and their use of tranquilizers and alcohol was slightly higher than that of the other cohorts. Data on their sources of knowledge about drug abuse indicate the need for greater attention to this issue in the medical curriculum.\r"

Fifty-one percent rated their school's committee as exerting a significant impact on the educational program over the previous five years. Fifty-six percent of the committees had a routine procedure for course review and used data from multiple sources when conducting curriculum evaluations. The committees that annually received a specific assignment from the dean were the most likely (91 percent) to be rated as having a significant impact, followed by committees that conducted frequent course reviews (66 percent). Thirty-eight percent of the committees were primarily faculty oriented, 29 percent were decidedly administrative in composition, and the remaining committees exhibited a mixture of membership.\r"

The quality-of-care scores were obtained by an in-office audit of a random selection of charts. The scores were global scores for charting, prevention, the use of 13 classes of drugs, and care of a two-year period for 182 different diagnoses. There were no relationships between global quality-of-care scores based on these randomly chosen charts and either the type or quantity of the physicians' CME activities. These activities were reading journals, attending rounds, attending scientific conferences, having informal consultations, using audio and video cassettes, and engaging in self-assessment. The implications of these findings are significant for future research in CME and for planners of present CME programs.\r"

  ".W": "The cyanomorpholino derivative of doxorubicin (MRA-CN) is an anthracycline that is extremely potent and non-cross-resistant with doxorubicin (DOX) in multidrug-resistant cells. MRA-CN binds to and cross-links DNA and thus has been proposed to act as a targeted alkylating agent. In our study, the number of DNA interstrand and DNA-protein cross-links produced by MRA-CN was identical in multidrug-resistant Dx5 and parental MES-SA cells, as shown by alkaline elution analysis. The amount of cross-linking was directly proportional to drug concentration at concentrations from 10(-11) to 10(-7) M MRA-CN. Extensive DNA cross-linking was evident within 30 minutes of drug exposure. After 1 hour of drug exposure, the number of DNA cross-links increased for 90 minutes, reached a plateau, and then began to decrease after 120 minutes. Loss of cell viability was also observed as early as 3 hours after exposure to MRA-CN. The finding of the same number of DNA cross-links in MES-SA and Dx5 cells indicates that similar amounts of MRA-CN are likely to enter the nuclei of multidrug-resistant and sensitive cells. Other anthracyclines have major differences in nuclear distribution in sensitive and resistant cells. Several factors may contribute to the non-cross-resistance of MRA-CN in multidrug-resistant cells. (a) The lipophilicity of MRA-CN facilitates cell entry. (b) The substitution and loss of basicity at the amino nitrogen may reduce the affinity of the drug for the P-glycoprotein efflux pump, compared with that of DOX. (c) The detoxification function of P-glycoprotein may be less effective for drugs that produce rapid and irreversible cell damage, such as the DNA-targeted alkylation caused by MRA-CN.\r"

Normal human foreskin specimens were first separated by differential trypsinization into two suprabasal fractions and one basal fraction. Utilizing complete MCDB 153 basal nutrient culture medium containing epidermal growth factor and insulin, we then evaluated the clonogenic potential of cells in these three fractions. Suprabasal cell fractions demonstrated a colony-forming efficiency as great as or greater than that of the basal cell fraction, and 10%-15% of the keratinocytes that grew in primary and secondary cultures expressed involucrin, a suprabasal keratinocyte differentiation marker. Of such involucrin-containing keratinocytes, 80% also possessed the potential to undergo DNA synthesis, as determined by autoradiography following a 48-hour incubation with [3H]thymidine. These observations support the conclusion that the human keratinocytes that grow in vitro in serum-free medium can be derived from suprabasal cells and, therefore, that a state of nonterminal keratinocyte differentiation exists.\r"

  ".W": "The oncolytic strain 73-T of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of cancer patients, but little is known about its mechanism of action. In this study, NDV strain 73-T and a wild-type isolate of NDV were found to be potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production by both human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and rat splenocytes. Antibody inhibition experiments identified TNF-alpha as the major species of TNF induced by NDV in PBMCs. The effect of recombinant human TNF-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) on human cancer cells was then examined. Neither rHuTNF-alpha nor supernatants from NDV-stimulated PBMCs were cytotoxic toward the TNF-resistant human malignant melanoma cell line MEL-14. However, when MEL-14 cells were treated with NDV strain 73-T, both rHuTNF-alpha and supernatants from NDV-stimulated PBMCs killed 48% and 55%, respectively, of these tumor cells. Treatment with NDV also conferred TNF susceptibility to the TNF-resistant human malignant melanoma cell line MEL-21 and the human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. In contrast to its enhanced cytotoxicity toward NDV-treated cancer cells, rHuTNF-alpha had no effect on NDV-treated normal human PBMCs proliferating in response to concanavalin A. These results suggest two important mechanisms for the antineoplastic activity of NDV: (a) induction of TNF-alpha secretion by human PBMCs and (b) enhancement of the sensitivity of neoplastic cells to the cytolytic effects of TNF-alpha.\r"

Women who smoked had a decreased relative risk of colorectal cancer compared with the risk for nonsmokers (age-adjusted relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.10). The risk for passive smokers was similar to that for smokers. The relative risks were significantly reduced for older women; relative risks were 0.42 for smokers and 0.66 for passive smokers over age 65. The data suggest that older women who smoke have a lower risk of colorectal cancer than nonsmokers. The effect may be mediated by an antiestrogenic effect of smoking.\r"

Cytochrome P-450 isoform d was induced by TCDD, isosafrole, phenothiazine, and AAF, while cytochrome P-450 isoform b was induced by phenobarbital, and to a lesser extent by isosafrole. These observations suggest that both MDR and cytochrome P-450 gene families are evolutionarily selected by the capacity of various xenobiotics to induce their own detoxification either through metabolism to hydrophilic derivatives by the cytochrome P-450 system or direct excretion from the cell by the MDR gene family. Furthermore, the data indicate that induction of selective members of the MDR and the cytochrome P-450 gene families may depend on overlapping regulatory elements.\r"

Radium-226 sources were used in 12,821 patients, x-ray therapy was used in 2,515 patients, and no radiotherapy was given to 2,694 patients. Cancer incidence in the cohort was searched by record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register for the period 1958-1982. The median age was 6 months for the treated patients and 8 months for the patients not receiving radiotherapy. In the group treated with radium-226 or orthovoltage x rays (greater than or equal to 100-kV peak), 224 cancers were observed [relative risk (RR) = 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.35]. In patients given contact x rays, 10 cancers were observed (RR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.34-1.30). In patients not treated with ionizing radiation, 34 cancers were observed (RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.64-1.29). In patients treated with radium-226 or orthovoltage x rays, an RR of 1.65 was observed for breast cancer (95% CI = 1.26-2.13) and an RR of 2.73 was found for soft tissue tumors (95% CI = 1.18-5.38). Patients with brain tumors, thyroid cancers, and bone tumors had received radiotherapy close to the tumor site more often than expected. For patients with breast cancer, no such difference was found. For cancers of the breast and thyroid, the RR was higher in patients given more than one treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Current management of myocardial contusion is based on experience with ischemic heart disease, but the mechanism responsible for cardiac dysfunction may be quite different. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pathophysiology of myocardial contusion in a controlled animal model. Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were prepared on a standard Langendorff apparatus, and myocardial function (DP, + dP/dT, - dP/dT) measured via a left ventricular balloon. Bipolar atrial and ventricular leads were placed to define conduction changes. Coronary sinus effluent was sampled for pO2, pH, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The hearts were freeze-clamped to measure phosphocreatine (PC) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Myocardial contusion was produced by a single blow with a weighted pendulum. Hearts were divided into control (n = 5), moderate impact--Group I (n = 5), and major impact--Group II (n = 5). Group I sustained a 25% decrease in function after an impact of 78 +/- 5 mJoules/gm, and Group II a 50% deficit after 87 +/- 7 mJoules/gm. Impact resulted in complete electrical arrest, followed by sequential ventricular, atrial, and AV nodal recovery; recovery time correlated directly with degree of injury. Coronary flow at 2 min postinjury was decreased (p less than 0.05) in Group I (12.8 +/- 0.8 ml/min) and Group II (11.5 +/- 1.3) compared to control (17.2 +/- 0.5), and returned to baseline levels at 20 min. LDH and CPK levels were twice as high in Group II as in Group I. The PC/ATP ratio in Group II increased from 1.63 at baseline to 2.54 (p less than 0.05) at 25 min, confirming ischemic reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anterolateral thoracotomies were performed in 14 patients because of unstable vital signs (ten) or cardiac arrest (four), and only two (14%) of these patients survived. In seven of these patients the incision was extended into a bilateral thoracotomy to provide better exposure for continued severe bleeding, and all seven died. Of 11 relatively stable patients having a posterolateral incision (ten) or a median sternotomy (one), only two (18%) died. Of 18 patients in whom the initial procedure was hilar clamping, ten (63%) survived. In seven patients an attempt was made to control the bleeding before hilar clamping and only one (14%) survived. In six patients, resection of a lobe (five) or a segment (one) was used to achieve hemostasis with five (83%) survivors. Eight of the 14 deaths were clearly due to blood loss, which was treated with an average of 19.5 units of blood. However, in six of the earlier deaths with much less blood loss, air emboli may have been a factor, but was unproven. Early vascular control at the hilum for central lung injuries seems to be needed not only to stop the bleeding but also to prevent systemic air emboli.\r"

Often esophageal perforation was not suspected and the symptoms were attributed to the more common injuries, or the diagnostic workup was incomplete. There were 24 (38%) infectious complications directly related to the esophageal perforation. In 21 of these, there was a delay in diagnosis.

However, children with blunt abdominal injury have been successfully treated nonoperatively for more than a decade. It has been recently proposed, based upon small series, that adults can be managed nonoperatively in a manner similar to that for children. To assess the likely safety for nonoperative management of adults with blunt abdominal injury, we determined the frequency of blunt gastrointestinal disruption in adults, and reviewed the sensitivity of the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disruption by computed tomography. The salient statistically significant findings, based upon an analysis of 6,301 adults and 1,275 children admitted following blunt trauma, were that blunt abdominal injury, blunt gastrointestinal injury, and blunt gastrointestinal disruption are much more frequent in adults. Based upon these findings and the low sensitivity reported for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disruption by computed tomography, we conclude that the nonoperative management of adults with blunt abdominal injury is as a matter of routine not justified.\r"

To define the extent of routine radiologic survey needed in patients with a depressed level of consciousness, the records of 789 adults with blunt injuries and a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 10 or less on admission were reviewed. Major skeletal injury (MSI), was defined as one or more fractures or dislocations of the axial spine, pelvis, hip, or long bones of the lower extremity. The overall incidence of MSI was 31%. Injuries to the axial spine were present in 14% of patients, while 10% sustained pelvic fractures or hip dislocations and 15% sustained femur or tibia-fibula fractures. Patients who sustained MSI had lower admission CRAMS, Trauma Score, GCS, and admission blood pressure compared to non-MSI patients (p less than 0.002). An analysis of mechanisms of injury showed that pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle (57%), and victims of motorcycle accidents (40%) had increased incidences of MSI (p less than 0.05). Patients suffering falls (18%) and assaults (2%) had a decreased incidence of MSI (p less than 0.01). The high incidence of potentially occult MSI in obtunded patients after blunt trauma demonstrated by this data suggests the need for routine radiologic survey including the axial spine, pelvis and long bones of the lower extremity. Mechanism of injury, CRAMS, TS, and GCS may be useful in the early identification of a particularly high-risk group.\r"

Some have suggested that excessive time requirements for IV access are detrimental to patient salvage. This prospective study objectively quantified the time required to place a peripheral IV line in our urban paramedic system. A third-party observer, nonparamedic, timed the procedure on scene with a stopwatch. Total intravenous time, including obtaining a 30-cc blood sample, was defined as the period from removal of the catheter cover until the catheter was taped. The study group included 125 patients (51 trauma and 74 nontrauma). The average total time to obtain IV access and sample blood was 2.20 +/- 0.20 and 2.71 +/- 0.18 minutes in trauma and nontrauma patients, respectively. In a subset of 63 patients in whom blood sampling time was determined separately, subtracting that from total IV time provided a net of 0.58 +/- 0.09 minutes to obtain access. Fourteen patients had a second IV line started (without blood sampling), requiring 1.25 +/- 0.38 and 0.70 +/- 0.24 minutes, respectively, for trauma and nontrauma patients. Paramedics were successful on their first IV attempt in 90% of trauma and 84% of nontrauma patients; ultimate success was 100%. This on scene study documents the time required for prehospital IV access, performed by a well-trained paramedic in an E.M.S. system with strong medical control, is less than 90 seconds.\r"

The volume of resuscitative fluid administered, change in BD, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and presence of ongoing hemorrhage were analyzed for differences between the BD groups. The MAP decreased significantly and the volume of fluid required for resuscitation increased with increasing severity of BD group. A BD that increased (became more negative) with resuscitation was associated with ongoing hemorrhage in 65%. The data suggest that the BD is a useful guide to volume replacement in the resuscitation of trauma patients.\r"

Thirty-three people required immediate evacuation to hospitals, most of them being transported 75 miles by helicopter air ambulance to level I and II trauma centers in the Denver metropolitan area. Eighteen of these air-evacuated patients were in serious or critical condition. Less seriously injured victims were treated at local medical facilities. The scene evacuation was carried out by helicopter and ground vehicles in accordance with an existing disaster plan coordinated by the Colorado Trauma Institute (CTI). The unique problems posed by a mass casualty incident in a remote mountain location are emphasized by this tragedy. Patient salvage due to the efficacy of a regionally organized trauma system is clearly demonstrated.\r"

In an attempt to quantify this risk, the records of 1,272 consecutive patients with blunt injuries admitted to a Level I regional trauma center were reviewed. Patients with serious craniocerebral injury were at no greater risk for injury to the cervical spine than patients without trauma to the head (1.8% vs. 3.5%, p = NS by Chi-square analysis). Although observance of cervical spine precautions is usually paramount, there may be times when this concern is superceded by the need to gain definitive airway control in a patient with injury to the brain.\r"

  ".W": "During a 1-year period, three patients presented with acute traumatic thrombosis of the common or external iliac artery concomitant with a massive crush injury to the pelvis. All had vascular compromise of the involved extremity on initial physical examination, but in two patients with open pelvic trauma, exsanguination, major visceral injury, hypothermia, and a coagulopathy precluded emergency vascular reconstruction. Both required hindquarter amputation for adequate debridement. The third patient presented without exsanguination or visceral trauma. Angiography and vascular reconstruction were undertaken, but myonecrosis compounded the initial vascular compromise, and eventually required a hip disarticulation for debridement. It was concluded that: exsanguination and/or major visceral injury takes priority over emergency vascular reconstruction; soft-tissue injury may preclude limb salvage despite vascular reconstruction. If a cadaveric limb exists, early radical amputation, including hindquarter amputation, should be undertaken.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 15 years' experience with childhood trauma at two hospitals in different cities, one a city hospital, the other a children's hospital, to learn the extent, circumstances, presentations, and consequences of major blunt abdominal trauma due to child abuse. Some 10,000 children admitted to these hospitals for treatment of injuries from 1972 through 1986 provided the basis for the study; the incidence and severity of pediatric trauma at the two hospitals was similar, in that 13% of the visits to both hospitals' emergency rooms were for trauma, of which 5% resulted in admission. Major blunt abdominal trauma due to child abuse accounted for 22 of these cases, six at the former, 16 at the latter, and represented less than 0.50% of all abused children seen at both institutions. The average age was 24 mo; 14 were boys and eight were girls. In only two instances was the family unit intact; in both, the child was abused by the babysitter. Otherwise, the father, or the mother's \"boyfriend,\" was responsible. Overall mortality was 45%, and was related both to type of injury and presenting signs. Of one who presented with an epigastric mass due to a pancreatic hematoma, none died; the pseudocyst which subsequently developed resolved on bowel rest and TPN. Of three who presented with bilious vomiting due to duodenal hematoma, none died; one required operative evacuation. Of five who presented with peritonitis due to duodenojejunal rupture, one died; this child presented greater than 24 hr following injury in profound septic shock. Of three who presented with hypovolemia due to moderate hemorrhage, none died; the former two were managed conservatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 325 +/- 25 grams with 20% full-thickness scald injuries were used. Therapeutic effects were examined at 4 or 24 hours after surface inoculation with a lethal dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Strain 59-1244). When used as a surface anode with an implanted silver needle cathode, the silver nylon was therapeutic at currents between 0.4 and 40 microA when applied at either test time and continued for 5 days (p less than 0.001). When used as a cathode, silver nylon was not effective. Nylon cloth without a silver metal coating was not effective without applied current or when used as an anode. Silver nylon dressings placed at 4 hours after inoculation but without applied current showed significant effectiveness (p less than 0.01). This effect, however, was significantly less than that seen with silver nylon used as an anode (p less than 0.001). Barrier prophylactic effects were examined by placing silver nylon or uncoated nylon on burn wounds before inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The uncoated nylon had no barrier effect. Silver nylon was found protective but applied current was not required for significant (p less than 0.001) barrier effect. These results indicate silver nylon dressings may be a valuable antimicrobial burn wound covering device.\r"

Before the triage system was implemented trauma victims were taken to the nearest appropriate hospital. Post-implementation, trauma victims with field CRAMS scores of 1 through 6 were triaged to the Level I Trauma Center. Of the 113 study patients, 53 were in the pre-implementation phase and 60 in the post-implementation phase. The study patients with CRAMS scores of 4 or less had lower mortality when cared for at the Level I Trauma Center (p = 0.013). We conclude that trauma patients who are severely injured (CRAMS less than or equal to 4) have a significantly higher rate of survival if taken to the Level I Trauma Center. The use of the CRAMS triage system appears to be an effective approach toward improving trauma care in Salt Lake County.\r"

NM deficits, together with hypermetabolism and immunosuppression, are debilitating processes which play a key role in the morbidity and mortality of burned patients. This study examined the usefulness of the murine model to replicate clinically observed NM dysfunction. Systemic effects of graded increases in burn size were studied in the acute phase (3 weeks) of burn trauma. Metabolic rates, immune response to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), maximum tension developed by gastrocnemius muscle, and the response of its NM junction to d-tubocurarine (dTc) were the parameters analyzed. Groups of male CF1 mice were given a 20%, 30%, and 50% total body surface area burn and compared to controls. By Day 21 postburn, all the burn groups showed elevated metabolic rates and immunosuppression to the inflammatory antigen DNFB. NM dysfunction evidenced as a significant depression of maximal tension development was observed in the 30% and 50% groups. A threefold increase in the effective dose (ED95) values of dTc was seen only in the 50% burn group. No NM junctional changes were seen in the 20% burn group. These findings are consistent with clinical observations. We conclude that the mouse is a useful model for evaluating NM dysfunction of burns.\r"

At the time of aortic repair, the involved segment was found to be atheromatous, had an intimal tear, and a flap that caused complete occlusion. Graft replacement was carried out employing a 12-mm DeBakey woven dacron prosthesis, which restored satisfactory circulation to both lower limbs. The patient developed myoglobinemia and subsequently died due to multiple organ failure 19 days following the accident. Tearing against the vertebral column, and bowel loop entrapment, in high-speed deceleration have been implicated as injury mechanisms as well as impingement by the belt or metal buckle, in such injuries. Also, our patient had existing atheromatous plaque, which was ruptured.\r"

The hypocalcemia is always associated with osteoblastic metastases and usually it is associated with increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity, acid phosphatase activity and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. Serum concentrations of magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin D frequently are decreased. Patients are in a positive calcium balance. The osteoblastic metastases seem to act as a calcium sink, creating a \"hungry tumor phenomenon\".

In a group of the tumor-bearing animals the influence of endocrine manipulation (castration, estradiol) on the serum concentration of these tumor markers was studied. As far as untreated tumor-bearing mice are concerned, the serum values of both PAP and PSA proved to be strictly dependent on the tumor volume measured. In the exponential growth phase of the grafted tumors, linear growth was linked with a correspondingly increasing PAP and PSA serum level of the test animals. A close correlation was found to exist between the two tumor markers; however, the indicator value of PSA was 20 to 50 times higher than that of PAP under the test conditions. PSA determination yielded no false-negative results, if PAP was elevated. PAP determination was false-negative in 21 per cent of cases with measurable tumors, although the serum level of PSA already showed marked elevation. In treated animals both markers were found to decrease. Arrested growth and tumor regression was associated with falling PAP and PSA serum levels or with levels within normal range. The results of this experimental study support the conclusion that prostate specific antigen represents a substantially more sensitive tumor marker than prostatic acid phosphatase.\r"

Hence, the value and limitations of screening blood sera from men with suspected immunologic infertility are not currently known. In this study 70 paired sera and semen samples were assayed by the immunobead test (IBT). A screening protocol for blood sera was constructed to be 100% sensitive for detecting semen specimens with 20% or more of sperm binding IgG or IgA immunobeads. The specificity of this screening protocol was determined to be 79%. Serum IgA was not a good predictor of IgA on the sperm surface. The true positive predictive rate for antisperm antibodies on the sperm surface using circulating antisperm antibodies as a screening assay was estimated to be as low as 35%. There was little correlation between the site of immunobead binding following passive antibody transfer from patients' sera to donor sperm and the site of naturally occurring antibodies on the patients' sperm surface. Although direct assessment of antibodies on the sperm surface is preferred, these data suggest that serum IgG alone can be used as a sensitive screening assay for antisperm antibodies in men. A positive screen dictates that a direct assay on semen should be performed.\r"

SPMI decreased the percentage of motile spermatozoa in a dose-dependent manner and motility was completely blocked in the presence of 1600 units/ml. Sperm velocity and beat/cross frequency showed a similar progressive decrease as the inhibitor was augmented. However, linearity was essentially not affected. The effects of SPMI on the percentage of motile spermatozoa increased with the time of contact between the inhibitor and spermatozoa. After 120 min., the IC50 was 35% lower than that observed at five min. The presence of seminal plasma did not prevent the inhibitory effects of the seminal plasma factor on sperm motility parameters. On the contrary, a potentiating effects was observed. The data suggest that the SPMI could play a significant role in cases of infertility caused by asthenospermia.\r"

This study provides evidence that genetic background, advancing age, and hormonal imbalance are important etiologic factors for prostatitis in rats. It also demonstrates that Lewis and Wistar rats develop a spontaneous nonbacterial prostatitis with advancing age, making them good animal models for the laboratory investigation of this disease. Spontaneous nonbacterial prostatitis is much more common in Lewis rats (72%) than in Wistar rats (27%, p less than .05), and does not occur in Sprague-Dawley rats. The incidence of spontaneous prostatitis is significantly higher in older animals than in younger animals (72% old adult Lewis rats vs. 30% young adult Lewis rats, p less than .05). Administration of exogenous 17 beta-estradiol increases the incidence and severity of prostatitis in old Wistar rats (100% treated vs. 27% control, p less than .01). Castration has a similar effect. Testosterone can block the effect of estradiol on prostatitis, however treatment with an anti-estrogen or an aromatase inhibitor to block estrogen action does not improve prostatitis in the rat. The major finding of this study is the demonstration that severe prostatitis can be induced in young adult Wistar rats by neonatal treatment with 17 beta-estradiol followed several months later in adulthood by testosterone administration. The results of this study suggest that genetic background, advancing age, and hormonal imbalance contribute to the pathogenesis of nonbacterial prostatitis in rats.\r"

Segments from nine different subjects all contained IR-AVP in concentrations ranging from 37 to 717 fmol/gm. wet weight, concentrations severalfold higher than those normally found in the circulation. IR-AVP was shown by high performance liquid chromatography to elute in the same position as synthetic AVP. AVP added to isolated preparations of the human vas deferens induced concentration-related repetitive phasic contractions without significant changes of baseline tension. These contractions seemed to be mediated via stimulation of vasopressin V1-receptors and were abolished in the presence of vasopressin antagonists. Contractions induced by electrical field stimulation were frequency-dependent and sensitive to tetrodotoxin and prazosin. They were not affected by the vasopressin antagonists used. AVP increased the response to electrical field stimulation and this effect was inhibited by vasopressin antagonists. The results suggest either that circulating AVP is taken up and accumulated by the human vas deferens, and/or that AVP is synthesized locally. They do not suggest co-release of AVP and noradrenaline from nerve endings. The physiological role of the AVP occurring in the human vas deferens remains to be established.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma and tumour concentrations of estramustine, estromustine, estradiol and estrone, the major metabolites of estramustine phosphate (estracyt), were determined in patients with prostatic carcinoma treated between one and nine years with repeated oral doses of estracyt (560 to 840 mg./day). The last dose was given 12 to 16 hours before sampling. The binding of radioactive estramustine and estromustine was determined in the tumour tissue to examine the possible role of estramustine-binding protein for the accumulation of these metabolites into the tumour. Comparison was made with benign prostate hyperplastic tissue from untreated patients. Estromustine was the main metabolite in plasma as well as in the tumour (range 235 to 450 and 205 to 485 ng./gm., respectively), whereas estramustine (20 to 45; 95 to 370), estrone (62 to 140; 63 to 160) and estradiol (8 to 15; 7 to 36) were found in lower concentrations. Interestingly the concentration of estramustine was as an average six times higher in the tumour than in plasma contrasting with the other metabolites which were present in equal amounts of the two localities. Binding of 3H-estramustine and 3H-estromustine was two to three times higher in the tumour than in benign hyperplastic tissue and negligible in plasma samples. The present study is the first where substantial amounts of cytotoxically active estramustine and estromustine are demonstrated in tumour tissue from estracyt treated patients. Our findings suggest a mechanism for selective uptake of these metabolites in prostatic cancer (estramustine-binding protein). The uptake and binding of estramustine and estromustine in the tumour may account for the clinical effects of estracyt in prostatic carcinoma.\r"

This cystic structure can be maintained for greater than 90 days and displays many of the differentiation characteristics of a normal bladder, both at the light and electron microscopy level. Preneoplastic urothelial cells behave in a similar manner recreating a heterotopic bladder lined by urothelium displaying aberrant differentiation and surface morphology. All tumorigenic cell lines tested in this model produced solid tumor growth within a few weeks. The subrenal capsule represents an alternative site for the reconstitution of urothelial material at different stages of neoplastic progression.\r"

  ".W": "Acquired renal cystic disease is a recently recognized disease entity that primarily afflicts patients on chronic hemodialysis. The incidence of acquired renal cystic disease in patients with end stage renal disease ranges from 30 to 95 per cent. The major complications of acquired renal cystic disease appear to be neoplasia and hemorrhage. Neoplasia has been demonstrated in up to 45 per cent of all end stage kidneys with acquired cystic disease. Our surgical experience with 7 cases of end stage renal disease is reported. Acquired renal cystic disease was noted in 4 of the 7 cases (57 per cent) and renal neoplasia was evident in all 7. Worldwide experience to date in combined pathology and radiology series of patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrates that acquired cystic disease, \"tumor\" (usually adenoma or oncocytoma) and renal carcinoma occur at respective rates of 47.1, 4.8 and 1.5 per cent. Since the pathologist will detect more tumors and cysts than the radiologist, these figures probably are an underestimate of the true incidence. Long-term surveillance of patients harboring end stage kidneys is recommended beginning with a baseline ultrasound.\r"

There were good correlations among deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern and histological grade, pathological stage and clinical outcome.

However, for the more common low grade, low stage tumors the occasional detection of deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy patterns identified an important subgroup of patients who experienced significantly poorer survival.\r"

A recent urological application has been the use of a balloon to dilate acutely the normal ureteral orifice and intramural ureter for the purpose of performing transurethral ureteroscopy. Complications of balloon dilation may result if over inflation and bursting of the balloon occur followed by ureteral injury. We report the pressure needed to dilate the ureter adequately in 122 patients during an 18-month period. Adequate dilation was achieved in 93 patients (78 per cent) at pressures of 8 atmospheres or less, while 27 (22 per cent) required more than 10 atmospheres of pressure. Balloon dilation was not satisfactory in 2 patients (2 per cent) but it was accomplished by metal bougies. Our results confirm the safety and efficiency of balloon dilation to facilitate ureteroscopy. Important safeguards when using this method include the use of balloons designed specifically for ureteral dilation, slow balloon inflation to allow for ureteral accommodation and the use of fluoroscopy to judge the end point of dilation.\r"

Priapism occurred exclusively in diabetic patients and patients with a neurological etiology of impotence. A total of 22 per cent of the patients reported moderate to severe pain with injection, 35 per cent indicated decreased quality of erection with time in response to the vasoactive agents and 28 per cent believed this therapy to be unsatisfactory. Among those who discontinued the injections 5 cited variability of erectile response (duration or quality) as the reason for discontinuation. A decrease in the effectiveness of the injections with time may be anticipated among some patients. For patients who face a penile implant without other options penile self-injection with vasoactive drugs is a reasonable alternative in that complications do not prevent successful prosthetic implantation.\r"

We observed 22 men with partial tumescence after an intracavernous injection of papaverine (15 to 30 mg.) and phentolamine (0.5 to 1.0 mg.). The penis was not rigid and the buckling pressures never exceeded 50 mm. Hg after 20 minutes of observation. In each case we immediately applied a vacuum constrictor device because these devices had been used successfully by other men with similar diagnoses. A total of 21 men responded within 30 to 60 seconds and achieved a rigid erection with buckling pressures of greater than 100 mm. Hg (16) and 60 mm. Hg (5). These findings indicate that a vacuum constrictor device may be used to augment a partial response to an intracavernous injection and that the availability of injections and vacuum constrictor devices provides these men with a more complete nonoperative program.\r"

Ten patients received an inflatable penile prosthesis and 4 of these were lost. Of the 4 uninfected patients 2 underwent successful reimplantation. Overall, the complication rate in the 63 patients was 33 per cent. After reimplantation 52 of the 63 patients have a functional device, resulting in an ultimate success rate of 82 per cent.

Since bacterial adherence has been shown to precede urinary tract infection in female patients it is assumed that this adherence to the foreskin in male patients also may be necessary before initiation of the disease. The high incidence of urinary tract infection in uncircumcised male patients combined with these findings of adherence of pathogenic bacteria to the mucosal surface of the foreskin, thus, would seem to be related.

Eighteen patients (56%) had renal insufficiency with a mean serum creatinine (SC) of 2.8 mg/dl. Nine patients had an aortic aneurysm; the remaining 23 patients had aortoiliac occlusive disease of varying severity. Aortic reconstruction was done with either a straight (six patients) or bifurcated (26 patients) Dacron graft. Renal revascularization was accomplished with either bypass (60 arteries) or transaortic endarterectomy (four arteries). One patient died of pulmonary embolism (operative mortality rate 3%). Beneficial blood pressure response was achieved in 28 of 31 survivors, (90%). Among the 18 patients with renal insufficiency, mean SC was 2.80 +/- 1.18 mg/dl preoperatively and 1.65 +/- 0.48 mg/dl postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Among eight patients with severe renal dysfunction before surgery (SC greater than 3 mg/dl), mean SC was 3.90 +/- 0.85 mg/dl before and 1.79 +/- 0.69 mg/dl after operation (p less than 0.001). In follow-up extending to 58 months (mean 27.6 months), five late deaths occurred; cumulative survival was 94% at 2 years and 60% at 4 years. There were no instances of worsening hypertension; one patient had deteriorating renal function. These results indicate that severe aortorenal atherosclerosis can be managed with simultaneous aortic reconstruction and bilateral renal revascularization at low operative risk. In addition, there can be high expectation of significant and persisting benefit in both hypertension and renal dysfunction after operation.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured by inulin and p-aminohippurate clearance, respectively. Group I (n = 8) included patients in stable condition after operation who were administered intravenous DA, 0.5 micrograms/kg/min, for 2 hours.

Increases were also observed in GFR (95.0 +/- 10.9 to 107 +/- 15.7 ml/min/1.73 m2), sodium excretion (164 +/- 35 to 239 +/- 53 mu Eq/min), and osmolar excretion (709 +/- 78 to 866 +/- 93 mu Osm/min). There were no changes in urine output (2.17 +/- 0.36 to 2.49 +/- 0.43 ml/min). Group II (n = 5) consisted of patients having abdominal aortic surgery who were treated with DA, 2.0 micrograms/kg/min, before and after surgery. Increases in RBF were seen in both the preoperative period (414 +/- 59 to 659 +/- 96 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.01) and postoperative period (439 +/- 60 to 623 +/- 94 ml/min/1.73 m2, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three patients had occlusive disease, one may have had renal artery occlusion, and 13 had aneurysms--three thoracoabdominal and 10 infrarenal. Rupture of aneurysm had occurred in one patient at each level and six patients had had one or more previous attempts at aneurysmal removal. Diagnosis and evaluation were made with the aid of intravenous pyelography, retrograde pyelography, CT scanning, and at operation (three patients). Three patients had two normally located right and left renal arteries. Twelve patients had one to three additional aberrant arteries arising from the aorta and iliac arteries. One patient's renal blood supply arose from multiple aberrant arteries. Ureters crossed the midline in two patients. Treatment of occlusive disease consisted of endarterectomy in one patient and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in two. Aneurysms were treated by graft replacement with retroperitoneal exposure in seven patients and transabdominal exposure in six. One patient was treated medically. Renal isthmus division was employed in only two patients and involved accessory arteries were reattached to the grafts in all cases. Death from myocardial infarction occurred in two patients (12%). Eleven patients subjected to operation were alive 6 months to 14 years later.\r"

This article discusses whether or not a prior attempt at PTRA compromises a subsequent elective or emergent surgical revascularization. Thirteen patients had surgical renal artery reconstruction after one or more PTRAs. Eight of the patients were treated because of atherosclerotic renal artery disease whereas five had a form of fibromuscular dysplasia. Five patients had renal artery injury directly related to the angioplasty. Four of these kidneys were saved. Eight patients were treated from 6 to 920 days after PTRA because of recurrent stenosis or occlusion of the renal artery. Only one of these kidneys was lost, an attempt at revascularization of a small kidney that failed to resume function. A prior attempt at PTRA did not compromise the ability of subsequent surgical revascularization to ameliorate hypertension. We conclude that surgical renal revascularization is not made less likely to succeed by a previous attempt at PTRA; even if the renal artery is thrombosed or perforated during the procedure, a reasonable chance of renal salvage is obtained by immediate surgical revascularization.\r"

  ".W": "Compression of the left renal vein (LRV) between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta has been termed the nutcracker syndrome. Although often asymptomatic, this syndrome may result in varicocele, ovarian vein syndrome, and rarely LRV hypertension, pelviureteral varices, hematuria, and flank pain. Previous surgical approaches have included nephrectomy, variceal ligation, nephropexy, or renocaval reimplantation. We report a new LRV stenting procedure that provided relief for a young woman incapacitated by daily left flank pain and microscopic hematuria. Phlebography of the LRV revealed mesoaortic compression associated with a pressure gradient of 12 mm Hg and preferential outflow down large pelviureteral varices. At operation compression of the LRV was corrected with an external stent of reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene. The patient was asymptomatic and free of hematuria for 9 months after operation and follow-up phlebography documented normal renocaval flow, elimination of the pressure gradient, and reduction of the pelviureteral varices. This represents the first description in the vascular surgical literature of this venous compression syndrome, which has been recognized in previous urologic and radiologic reports reviewed herein. Vascular surgeons should be cognizant of the nutcracker syndrome, and we recommend this new stenting procedure as a more simple and physiologic therapy than previous approaches to this problem.\r"

  ".W": "An in vivo system was established whereby the transmural forces exerted across the arterial wall during vascular occlusion were directly measured. Evaluation of various currently available vascular occlusive devices was conducted and transmural force transmission data were recorded. The clamps were classified according to their mechanical design characteristics. The magnitude of force required to obtain cessation of distal flow varied significantly among devices of differing mechanical design but correlated well when compared with clamps of similar design. This information was then compared with graded analysis of the degree of intimal injury created by these specific devices as assessed with scanning electron microscopy. The amount of transmural force exerted by each individual device correlated with the grade of intimal injury created by that device. We conclude that fundamental clamp design dictates the magnitude of applied transmural force, that force and the vectors of the application of that force are directly responsible for the degree of resultant intimal injury, and that the intima appears to possess an injury threshold of approximately 5 x 10(4) dynes/cm2. Intimal injury may determine success or failure of vascular surgical procedures; therefore it is prudent to seek the least traumatic means of vascular occlusion.\r"

To examine this issue, 47 patients with necrotizing wet gangrene of the foot were randomized prospectively to receive either a one-stage amputation (definitive below- or above-knee amputation with delayed secondary skin closure in 3 to 5 days) or a two-stage amputation (open ankle guillotine amputation followed by definitive, closed below- or above-knee amputation). Antibiotic coverage was standardized with clindamycin and gentamicin used in all patients. Preoperative blood cultures and intraoperative foot cultures were obtained, as well as cultures from the deep muscle and lymphatic area along the saphenous vein to determine the presence of bacteria at the level of initial amputation. Twenty-four patients (11 diabetic and 13 nondiabetic) were randomized to the one-stage procedure. Twenty-three patients (14 diabetic and nine nondiabetic) were randomized to the two-stage procedure. Five of 24 patients in the one-stage group (21%) had positive muscle cultures vs 10 of 23 patients in the two-stage group (43%). Two of 24 patients in the one-stage group (8%) had positive lymphatic cultures vs 7 of 23 patients in the two-stage group (30%).

  ".U": "89012281\r", 
  ".W": "During the past 6 years, we have encountered 24 cases in which all major infrapopliteal arteries were occluded as determined by adequate preoperative angiography. Each patient initially had critical ischemia, 14 had a previous failed ipsilateral distal bypass, and seven had an unsuccessful lumbar sympathectomy. Instead of resorting to an amputation, we attempted to perform a bypass using patent branches of distal vessels. Of the 24 bypasses, 14 were to the lateral or medial plantar branches, three were to the deep plantar branch (plantar arch), three were to the lateral tarsal branch, and four were to unnamed branches of the proximal one third of the posterior tibial arteries (two) or anterior tibial arteries (two). All bypasses were performed with reversed saphenous vein with origins at or distal to the superficial femoral artery. Eight bypasses (four plantar and four unnamed branches) became thrombosed up to 30 months postoperatively, resulting in four below-knee amputations. Fifteen bypasses (all plantar branches) have been patent from 6 to 52 months (mean 26 +/- 13 months). The remaining patient required a below-knee amputation at 2 months despite a patent graft. These results underscore the value of this extended approach to limb salvage in situations previously believed to be indications for major amputations. Although bypasses to unnamed branches of the proximal tibial arteries did not fare well, those to the plantar branches and lateral tarsal branch resulted in excellent graft patency and limb salvage.\r"

All operations were performed by the same surgeon in a community hospital from 1963 to 1986. Arteriographic findings consisted of carotid stenosis of 50% or greater in 88.5% of patients and stenosis less than 50% and/or an ulcerated plaque in the remaining 11.5%. Medical risk factors were detected in 92% of patients; hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary atherosclerosis were most prevalent. All operative procedures were conducted with the patients under general anesthesia, routine shunting, and arterial closure without a patch. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5% (10 patients); the morality rate was 0.8% (three deaths from myocardial infarction and two from stroke) for a combined stroke and mortality rate of 2.0% (13 of 605 patients). Follow-up (mean 61.8 months) was possible in 570 (96%) of the patients surviving operation without a perioperative stroke. The cumulative probability of late stroke (i.e., cerebral infarct ipsilateral to the operated artery) was 2.5% at 5 years and 8.1% at 10 years. When the perioperative stroke-mortality rate (2.0%) is combined with the data for late ipsilateral stroke, the 5- and 10-year probabilities of ipsilateral stroke were 4.5% and 9.9%, respectively (mean 1% per year for 10-year period). Coronary atherosclerosis accounted for 43% of late deaths and 16% of strokes. The perioperative stroke-mortality rate of 2.0% in this group of patients falls within the acceptable range for carotid endarterectomy in patients with TIA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The carotid artery contralateral to the endarterectomy was severely stenosed (lumen diameter reduction 51% up to 99%) and it was not repaired for different reasons. Group I patients were compared with 78 patients who had bilateral CE (group II), matched with group I for associated diseases, operative indication, and angiographic findings. In this analysis, only neurologic deficits referable to the contralateral hemisphere were considered. There was a higher incidence of later neurologic deficits in the group I patients; however, this difference was not statistically significant. In group I, the occurrence of late neurologic deficits was statistically correlated to (1) severity of stenosis, (2) presence of large compound ulceration, and (3) history of previous stroke. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified two groups of patients at higher risk for late neurologic deficits (1) patients with stenosis 75% or greater and large ulceration and (2) patients with stenosis 75% or greater and previous stroke. CE on the asymptomatic contralateral side should be considered in selected patients at high risk for late neurologic events at a surgical center with an established low incidence of perioperative complications. A nonoperative policy with careful follow-up is warranted in the remaining cases.\r"

Six patients had two filters inserted. An inferior venacavogram was performed before filter insertion in all patients. Cavography provided vital information concerning diameter of the inferior vena cava, the level of the renal veins, and the presence and location of thrombus. Filter placement was accomplished in all patients in whom it was attempted. There were four minor complications and one periprocedural death. The incidence of documented femoral vein thrombosis that could be related to percutaneous placement via the femoral veins was 33%; however, none of these patients had permanent venous stasis sequelae. Percutaneous insertion of the Greenfield filter is a safe and convenient procedure and is superior to surgical placement in terms of time, logistics, and the accuracy of filter positioning.\r"

Nine patients had popliteal aneurysms, causing popliteal vein thrombosis in three patients and vein compression without thrombosis in six patients. Five patients had iliac artery aneurysms, producing left iliac vein thrombosis in one patient and venous compression without thrombosis in four patients. In 10 patients the cause of the venous compression symptoms was correctly identified and appropriate revascularization was performed with successful results. In four patients, two with iliac artery aneurysms and two with popliteal artery aneurysms, the associated aneurysm was not identified. One patient died of a ruptured aneurysm and three patients had below-knee amputations because of untreatable distal ischemia. Inappropriate treatment of patients with venous obstruction from unrecognized arterial aneurysms is associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality. Accurate diagnosis with timely aneurysm repair eliminates the risk of aneurysm rupture or thrombosis and simultaneously alleviates venous compression symptoms.\r"

Similar coating of prosthetic arterial grafts may promote in vivo graft endothelialization if graft patency is not adversely affected. In each of 15 dogs, two fibronectin-coated polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and two grafts that were not coated were implanted. One graft in each pair was seeded with autologous endothelial cells, so that four different grafts were studied in each animal: a coated, seeded graft; a coated graft that was not seeded; a seeded graft that was not coated; a graft that was neither coated nor seeded. At 2, 4, and 8 weeks, grafts from five animals were examined for patency, surface endothelialization, and indium 111 platelet reactivity. After seeding, surface coverage by endothelium of coated grafts was more complete and more rapid than in uncoated grafts (64% +/- 23% vs 31% +/- 13% at 4 weeks, p less than 0.05). Without seeding, coated grafts also appeared to have increased endothelial cell ingrowth compared with plain grafts (48.8% +/- 15.1% vs 37.6% +/- 1.5% at 8 weeks). Early (2-week) platelet reactivity of coated grafts was increased (p = 0.06), but patency was not adversely affected. Thus fibronectin coating of prosthetic grafts promotes surface endothelialization in vivo without altering graft patency.\r"

All but one patient had revascularization of the superior mesenteric artery, alone or in combination with another revascularization. Various surgical techniques were used, including retrograde bypass in 24 patients, antegrade bypass in 11 patients, and endarterectomy in the remaining six patients. Seven patients had acute abdominal symptoms and required emergency operation while in the hospital awaiting elective revascularization. There were two deaths in the perioperative period (4.9%), both caused by bowel necrosis. Six patients are known to have had late revascularization failure, resulting in recurrent symptoms in three patients and two subsequent deaths. All patients who remained asymptomatic after late graft failure had undergone multiple vessel revascularization; no patient revascularized prophylactically had symptoms of intestinal angina during the follow-up period. Early mesenteric revascularization is a safe and effective method of relieving the symptoms of chronic visceral ischemia and may prevent the development of fatal bowel necrosis.\r"

Endothelial cells from bovine thoracic aortas (AECs) and inferior vena caval (VECs) were harvested, maintained in cell culture, and characterized. VECs were consistently larger (mean cell diameter 14.3 micron vs 12.7 micron; p less than 0.001) and more pleomorphic than were AECs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that VECs were thinner than AECs and that VECs had numerous fine, cellular processes that were much less abundant on the AECs. Enzymatic disaggregation of confluent cells resulted in a reduced generation time by the AECs compared with VECs. Moreover, VECs responded to disaggregation by a significantly larger increase in cell size than the AECs. Protein synthesis was quantitated by computer analysis of autoradiograph of two-dimensional gel eletrophoresis and separation of 998 35S-methionine-labeled proteins from cell lysates. Synthesis of 257 proteins was significantly different (p less than 0.05); synthesis of 239 proteins by VECs was either decreased (219) or undetectable (20) compared with those of AECs. In contrast, only 18 proteins were produced in significantly greater quantity by VECs than by AECs. The cytoskeletal proteins actin and alpha- and beta-tubulins were produced in significantly greater quantity by AECs than VECs. These results indicate that cultured endothelial cells of arterial origin are substantially different from those of the venous circulation. These phenotypic differences are maintained in vitro despite eliminating variability in hemodynamic stress and interaction with other cellular elements of the vessel wall.\r"

To determine the long-term benefits and value of CE in these patients, a 10-year review of 253 patients who suffered a RIND or stroke was conducted. All patients had CT brain scans, as well as arch, extracranial, and intracranial arteriography; any patients without demonstrated carotid bifurcation disease were excluded from the study. On the basis of clinical symptoms and CT scan findings, 66 patients were categorized as having sustained a RIND and 187 a stroke. One hundred fifty-one patients who suffered a RIND or stroke had CE, whereas 102 patients with RIND or stroke did not have CE and served as a control group. All endarterectomies were performed with a temporary indwelling shunt. Postoperative complications included two deaths (1%), six strokes (4%), and 10 transient neurologic deficits (7%). In follow-up extending to 10 years the cumulative incidence of recurrent stroke was only 7% (11 patients) in the operated group, whereas 18% of patients in the nonoperated control group (18) sustained a recurrent stroke (p less than 0.05). As anticipated, the leading cause of death during follow-up was cardiac related; although CE did not significantly improve long-term survival, there was more than a twofold decrease in the incidence of recurrent stroke as a cause of death in the group having CE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen mongrel dogs had 30 minutes of thoracic aortic occlusion to determine the effects that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may have on preserving spinal cord blood flow and function during a period of temporary spinal cord ischemia. Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta causes renal ischemia and activates the renin-angiotensin system with resulting increased production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral constrictor and elevated levels may constrict collateral spinal cord circulation. At the time of aortic cross-clamping, 10 dogs received 100 mg/kg of MK422 (intravenous enalapril maleate), a converting enzyme inhibitor, and nine animals served as controls. The blockade of the renin-angiotensin system had no preserving effects on spinal cord flow as measured by microspheres and on spinal cord function as graded with the Tarlov scale. However, the paraplegic animals all had significantly increased lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cord flows 30 minutes after clamp release when compared with those animals that remained neurologically intact. In conclusion, marked hyperemia occurring after a period of hypoperfusion may lead to spinal cord edema and compartment syndrome with resulting paraplegia.\r"

They were divided into ten groups according to maternal infectivity and compliance with the vaccination schedule. Serum samples were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. In 786 infants who had highly infectious mothers and who received hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccine on schedule, the protective efficacy was about 85%. The efficacy seemed to be slightly lower in those immunized off schedule. Overall, 11% of infants still carried hepatitis B surface antigen, and 81% of the infants had antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen that exceeded 10 mIU/mL in more than 90% of them. The geometric mean titers of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen were more than 200 mIU/mL in every group of infants. We conclude that the mass vaccination program is efficacious in preventing perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission and the chronic carrier state; most infant vaccinees have adequate levels of protective antibody at 18 months of age. This program is extremely significant in the control of hepatitis B virus infection in Taiwan.\r"

We examined variations among hospitals in patient characteristics known independently to affect the risk of adverse outcomes and focused on patient comorbidity, defined as the state of health at admission apart from the primary diagnosis. Data from a study of 2935 incident cancer patients treated in seven Southern California hospitals revealed substantial variations among hospitals in age, cancer stage, and the burden of comorbid conditions. In the highest-ranked hospital, 17.9% of patients had high levels of comorbidity, compared with 9.3% in the lowest-ranked hospital. The three hospitals with the highest comorbidity were also identified as high-mortality outliers in a recent California report on hospital mortality rates. We conclude that comorbidity must be considered in any hospital quality assessment method based on patient outcome. If it is not considered, variations in referral and admission patterns may be misinterpreted as differences in hospital quality.\r"

We also describe the design and results of a national probability survey of physicians in 18 specialties. We present the results--estimated values of work and its dimensions--for selected services. Our findings indicate that physicians can give reliable and valid ratings of work and that we can model this work as a function of four dimensions: time, mental effort and judgment, technical skill and physical effort, and stress. Analyzing the complex functional relationship between work and these four dimensions shows that all four dimensions are important and statistically significant in predicting work. Time is a more important dimension in predicting work for medical specialties than for surgical specialties, with the estimated regression coefficients between .3 and .5 and .2 and .3, respectively. In contrast, technical skill is a more important dimension in predicting work in surgical specialties than for medical specialties, with the estimated regression coefficients between .3 and .5 and .2 and .3, respectively. Finally, we found that an exponential equation of the four dimensions precisely describes total work.\r"

For methodological and practical reasons, we could not obtain direct ratings of preservice and postservice work except for a few services. We therefore developed a systematic process to estimate preservice and postservice time and rate of work per unit of time. Then time and work per unit of time were multiplied to estimate work. The major finding of our investigation is that preservice and postservice work make up a substantial portion of total work. The typical percentages of total work accounted for by preservice and postservice work range from 26% and 33% for imaging services and evaluation and management services, respectively, to 46% for invasive services performed in a hospital inpatient setting.\r"

We distinguished two kinds of pairs of link services, those judged to be the same and those judged to be equivalent, usually within a narrow category of medical activity. Working with a cross-specialty panel of physicians and with data on time factors from a national survey, we selected sufficient links to connect each specialty to others by at least four links. We then used the weighted least-squares method to locate all the links optimally on a single, common scale. Analyses of the accuracy of this scale showed that the typical disagreement between specialties about where to locate the intraservice work of a given service was only 7%. Other analyses showed that the accuracy of the common scale was not sensitive to different classes of links.\r"

In this article we describe the development of the practice cost index used in constructing the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS). We derived the practice cost index value for each specialty, using specialty-specific practice costs and gross revenue data. The index values for all other specialties are standardized to the value for general surgery, and these are used to adjust the resource-based relative values for services performed by each specialty; in this way, the RBRVS incorporates practice cost variations. The data used in the construction of the practice cost index are the 1983 Physician Practice Cost and Income Survey data, adjusted to reflect the relative levels of 1986 professional liability insurance. Our findings show that among most specialties, the range of relative difference in practice costs as a percentage of gross revenue is approximately 15%. Four specialties fall outside this range: pathology, psychiatry, rheumatology, and orthopedic surgery. We discuss problems with the available data on practice costs as these relate to their use in the RBRVS and conceptual issues in applying practice costs to the construction of the RBRVS.\r"

Surveys of a variety of specialists using the magnitude-estimation method show that physicians agree closely in rating the work of particular E/M services. Regardless of the type of E/M service, the site at which it is performed, or the specialty performing it, work per unit of time varies only slightly. Comparison of work and time for services to which experts assigned billing codes in our consultative process indicates, however, that there may be large differences in the way different specialties use these billing codes. In some instances, work entailed by some of the E/M billing codes within specialties also appears to vary substantially. If empirical studies of physicians' coding and billing practices support our findings, possible responses might include (1) developing specialty-specific resource-based relative values for E/M services and (2) redefining the Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology, edition 4, codes for these services in terms that include time specifications.\r"

  ".W": "We surveyed approximately 850 physicians in eight surgical specialties to investigate physicians' work in performing invasive services. Building on our analysis of physician work, we developed a relative value scale of physicians' services based on resource costs. First, we found that physician charges are not set in proportion to the resources required to perform a given procedure: there is a threefold variation, across hospital-based invasive procedures, in the ratio of charges to resource-based relative values. Second, for most procedures, the preoperative and postoperative periods represent 60% to 75% of a physician's total service time, but only 35% to 50% of the total service work. Lastly, intraoperative work per unit of time varies greatly. Work per minute for invasive procedures is two to three times that of medical office visits and is strikingly greater for some specialties. The Resource-Based Relative Value Scale, at a minimum, represents a useful tool for payers to identify procedures with potentially aberrant charges and also offers unique insights into the nature of physicians' work.\r"

Using an arbitrarily defined BDI cutoff point of 14 or greater, at least 12% of the class showed considerable depressive symptoms at any assessment during the first three years; the largest fraction (25%) was symptomatic near the end of the second year. The median class BDI score increased almost threefold during the first two years. Students were likely to be in a similar class ranking at all assessments, indicating that for many students dysphoric mood was enduring. Those with BDI scores of 21 or greater were more likely to quit medical school. Students with high scores for dysphoria were not more likely to evidence a family history of major depression or concomitant substance abuse. Women medical students were not more vulnerable to depressed mood than men.\r"

However, little information on the relationship between self-reported alcohol use and subsequent risk of fatal injury is available. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the usual number of drinks consumed per occasion and the incidence of fatal injuries in a cohort of US adults. Using data on self-reported alcohol use obtained from 13,251 adults who were included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (mean length of follow-up, 9.3 years), we calculated the incidence of fatal injury according to the usual number of drinks consumed per occasion. After we adjusted for the effects of age, sex, race, and education, persons who consumed five or more drinks per occasion were nearly twice as likely to die from injuries (relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 3.5) than persons who drank fewer than five drinks per occasion. A dose-response relationship was observed between the usual number of drinks consumed per occasion and risk of fatal injury, with persons who reported drinking nine or more drinks per occasion being 3.3 times more likely to die from injuries (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.3). These data demonstrate the impact of alcohol use on mortality from injuries in the United States and suggest that self-reported alcohol consumption is an important indicator of risk for fatal injury.\r"

Half of the charts were reviewed before and half were reviewed after June 1986, when Connecticut enacted PA86-345, a law changing court rules of evidence so that the analysis by a hospital of a patient's blood could be used to establish probable cause for driving while under the influence of an intoxicant. We predicted and found no change in house-staff practice after passage of the law, since information about intoxication was obtained for immediate treatment. The rate of testing remained constant at 25%, with the median alcohol concentration at 200 mg/dL. Not one patient was referred for alcohol abuse evaluation or treatment. We recommend more vigorous attempts to evaluate, diagnose, and refer patients who abuse alcohol since they threaten the public health.\r"

The antidepressant treatment was begun for different reasons in each case. All three patients developed what has been termed the early tricyclic jitteriness syndrome. This reaction may have stimulated conditioned craving for cocaine because of the similarity between this syndrome and cocaine intoxication. Since desipramine is being used to reduce cocaine craving, it is important to recognize this paradoxical increase in craving as a potential adverse effect of desipramine.\r"

One goal of the National Cholesterol Education Program is to improve the quality of laboratory tests. Currently, 5% limits of imprecision and 5% of bias vs the nationally accepted Abell-Kendall reference method is recommended, with a goal of reducing these limits to 3% by 1992. Clinicians must be aware of how the cholesterol values are obtained, and especially whether the laboratory's method meets the performance goals. We assayed patients' serum samples for cholesterol using several commercially available, routinely used enzymatic methods and by the Abell-Kendall reference method. Precision of these methods was also assessed using serum-based controls. All instruments were operated precisely according to the manufacturers' instructions. Performance was objectively judged based on the National Cholesterol Education Program goals and on medically allowable total error. In all cases, the DuPont aca, the Kodak Ektachem, the Hitachi 737, and the Cobas FARA determined cholesterol levels acceptably. The precision and accuracy goals of 3% are achievable by these methods.\r"

The features of the circulatory dynamics in each disease are discussed based on the results of this study. The glomeruli were hyalinized at random in diabetic glomerulosclerosis. The distribution of hyalinized glomeruli occurred at random in normal kidney, which suggests that glomeruli become hyalinized with no dependency on the vasculature. Malignant nephrosclerosis on the other hand, shows that the glomeruli are hyalinized in clusters, and that suggests that the kidneys react to hypertensive changes in the interlobular artery and more peripheral arteries. The glomeruli supplied by the interlobular arteries will then hyalinize in clusters. If these two renal diseases are used as an end of a spectrum, the distribution pattern of hyalinized glomeruli in chronic glomerulonephritis showed most similarity with that seen in malignant nephrosclerosis. However, the percentage of hyalinized glomeruli was 21% in malignant nephrosclerosis as opposed to 77% in chronic glomerulonephritis. This marked difference suggests that in malignant nephrosclerosis, the percentage of hyalinized glomeruli was low due to participation of arteries larger than the accurate branches. However, the patients became uremic within a short time. Contrary to this finding, in chronic glomerulonephritis, the effect is from the smaller arteries less than that from the interlobular artery. Ordinarily, if an insufficient number of glomeruli become hyalinized, uremia will not develop. Finally, the difference in the genesis and vascular participation of diffuse type and nodular type of diabetic glomerulosclerosis and the relationship between acute glomerulonephritis and chronic glomerulonephritis are discussed.\r"

Therefore, we determined NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in distal nephron segments from three groups of adrenalectomized (adx) rabbits maintained on different doses of aldo (in an osmotic minipump) for seven days. Group 1 was given 1.5 micrograms aldo/100 g body wt/day, whereas groups 2 and 3 were maintained on 5 micrograms and 50 micrograms of aldo/100 g body wt/day, respectively. Aldo concentrations in the plasma of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 10.4 +/- 0.8, 70 +/- 7 and 408 +/- 133 ng/dl, respectively. There was a significant increase in NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in connecting tubule (CNT) and cortical, outer and inner medullary duct segments (CCD, OMCD and IMCD) but not in cortical thick ascending limb (CTAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in group 2 as compared to group 1. A further increase in plasma concentration of aldo (group 3) did not produce any more increase in NEM-sensitive ATPase activity in the CNT, CCD, OMCD and IMCD, but did increase the enzyme activity in the DCT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that aldo increases H+ secretion in the connecting tubule and collecting duct segments by increasing the activity of NEM-sensitive H+-ATPase activity in these segments.\r"

To determine the role of the renin angiotensin system in the protective effect of K depletion, we performed studies of vascular reactivity in intact SHR and of angiotensin II (Ang II) binding to mesenteric artery particles and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in culture from SHR. Pressor sensitivity to Ang II (+/- converting enzyme inhibition) but not norepinephrine was reduced in K depleted SHR. Thus, the decreased vascular reactivity in K depletion was specific for Ang II rather than a generalized defect. Ang II binding and receptor number (Bmax) (156 +/- 20 vs. 81 +/- 5 fmol/mg of protein, P less than 0.01) were increased in K depleted mesenteric artery particles. Since K depletion and increases in Ang II have both been associated with increased Ang II binding, Ang II binding was measured after bilateral nephrectomy. Despite reduction of plasma renin activity, total binding and Bmax were still increased in nephrectomized K depleted SHR. To determine the specific effect of K depletion independent of Ang II on Ang II binding, studies were performed in mesenteric artery VSMC from SHR grown in culture. VSMC from K replete SHR were grown to confluency in K replete medium and then were incubated in K depleted medium for 24 hours. Binding was saturable, time and temperature-dependent in K replete and K depleted cells. Total binding and Bmax (139 +/- 13 vs. 93 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.01) were increased in K depleted cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since the mammalian kidney comprises different nephron segments located in well-delineated zones, it is conceivable that the hypertrophy does not affect all kidney zones and all nephron segments uniformly. The present experiments were designed to study the chronic effects of high or low isocaloric protein diets (HP = 32% or LP = 10% casein, respectively) on kidney function and morphology in Sprague-Dawley rats. HP diet induced significant increases in kidney mass, GFR, free water clearance, and maximum urine concentrating ability. Kidney hypertrophy was characterized by: 1. a preferential increase in thickness of the inner stripe of the outer medulla (IS) (+54%, P less than 0.001, while total kidney height, from cortex to papillary tip, increased only by 18%); 2. a marked hypertrophy of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) in the inner stripe (+40% epithelium volume/unit tubular length, P less than 0.05) but not in the outer stripe nor in the cortex; 3. an increase in heterogeneity of glomeruli between superficial (S) and deep (D) nephrons (D/S = 1.47 in HP vs. 1.17 in LP, P less than 0.05). In contrast, normal kidney growth with age and kidney hypertrophy induced by uninephrectomy were not accompanied by preferential enlargement of IS structures. The morphologic changes induced by high protein intake parallel those we previously reported in rats fed a normal diet (25% protein) but in which the operation of the urine concentrating mechanism was chronically stimulated by ADH infusion or by reduction in water intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We determined if the nephritogenic antibody of PHN (gamma 1 sheep anti-Fx1A IgG) directs insertion of the MAC into GEC plasma membranes with consequent cytotoxicity. Antibody-sensitized GEC were exposed to various sera serving as sources of complement. Loss of cell viability was determined by trypan blue uptake and/or by release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Incubation of antibody-sensitized primary and passaged GEC in fresh human serum (FHS) resulted in sigmoidal relationships between cytotoxicity and complement dose (r = 0.97 and 0.94, respectively) such that cytolysis approached 100% with FHS (10% vol/vol). Cytotoxicity was not evident if C8-deficient (C8D) plasma was substituted for FHS, but was restored in a dose-dependent manner by reconstitution with purified rat C8. Sublytic injury was demonstrated by wide separation between simultaneous release curves of cell-incorporated biscarboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein (BCECF; mol wt approximately equal to 520) and LDH at limiting doses of complement (at 2% FHS, BCECF release was 51.1 +/- 0.6% of maximum vs. 3.2 +/- 1.3% for LDH; N = 3) and by blebbing of the plasma membrane on electron microscopy. Thus, the pathogenic antibody of PHN produces complement-mediated sublytic as well as lytic cytotoxicity of GEC.\r"

Thus, handling of potassium by superficial nephron segments was examined in a rat model of antiglomerular basement membrane nephritis. Sampling the same nephron successively from the end and beginning of the distal tubule and the end of the proximal tubule allowed a segmental analysis. Despite a 40% reduction in GFR, potassium excretion in the glomerulonephritis animals was normal due to an increase in FEK. The proximal tubule and loop segment did not contribute to the enhanced FEK seen in these animals. In contrast, potassium entry along the distal tubule was significantly greater in the experimental group averaging 13.7 +/- 4.3 pmol/min compared to 1.2 +/- 1.7 pmol/min in controls (P less than 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that distal tubule potassium entry at any level of flow was enhanced in glomerulonephritis compared to controls (P less than 0.0001). Plasma aldosterone levels were similar in both groups of animals. Thus, the adaptation to potassium excretion seen in glomerulonephritis is partly achieved by the distal tubule through flow-rate independent mechanisms and appears to be independent of plasma aldosterone levels.\r"

To determine whether augmented brush border Na/H exchange might mediate enhanced proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption in these disorders, we measured Na/H exchange activity in cortical brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from rats and rabbits adapted to hypercapnia and other chronic acid-base disturbances. BBMV prepared from control animals and animals with chronic acid-base disturbances were similar as judged by marker enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and ouabain-sensitive phosphatase. Despite profound respiratory acidosis, no increase in Na/H exchange activity could be detected in vesicles prepared from rats adapted to chronic (8 to 10 days) or subacute (24 hr) respiratory acidosis. In addition, vesicles prepared from rabbits exposed to chronic hypercapnia did not show increased Na/H exchange when compared with contemporaneous controls. By contrast, in agreement with previously published results, amiloride-sensitive sodium uptake was increased by 30% in vesicles derived from animals with ammonium chloride-induced acidosis compared with contemporaneous controls. Two models of chronic metabolic alkalosis were also studied; vesicles from alkalotic rats did not show any alteration in Na/H exchange. We conclude that metabolic acidosis, but not respiratory acidosis or metabolic alkalosis, leads to enhanced activity of the luminal Na/H exchanger.\r"

Characteristics of GSH uptake were the same as previously reported for basal-lateral membrane vesicles, namely, uptake was Na+-dependent, inhibited by gamma-glutamylglutamate and/or probenecid, and not inhibited by cysteinylglycine or the constituent amino acids. Studies with inhibitors of gamma-glutamyltransferase (acivicin) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (buthionine sulfoximine) showed that GSH uptake, degradation and resynthesis are independent processes. The GSH uptake rate with 1 mM GSH was approximately three-fold greater than the GSH synthetic rate with 1 mM amino acids. To examine whether uptake of GSH can supplement synthesis to protect against injury, we incubated cells with a toxic concentration of t-butylhydroperoxide with or without GSH or its constituent amino acids. Although amino acids provided significant protection, GSH provided greater protection (cells with t-butylhydroperoxide plus GSH were not significantly different from cells alone). This protection by GSH was eliminated by gamma-glutamylglutamate or probenecid, indicating that GSH uptake was required for the protection seen. Protection was also eliminated when the GSSG reductase/GSH peroxidase system was inhibited by bischloronitrosourea (BCNU), indicating that GSH transport affords protection by maintaining GSH levels in the cell. Thus, intact GSH is transported into isolated proximal tubule cells by a Na+-dependent system, and this transported GSH can be used to supplement endogenous synthesis and GSSG reduction to protect cells against oxidative injury.\r"

We evaluated the role of lymphatic absorption in the kinetics of peritoneal dialysis during standardized four hour exchanges in six children using 40 ml/kg of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution. Cumulative lymphatic absorption averaged 10.4 +/- 1.6 ml/kg and reduced the total net transcapillary ultrafiltration during the dwell time by 73 +/- 10%. Due to the considerable lymphatic absorption rate, maximum intraperitoneal volume was observed before osmolar equilibrium. Extrapolated to four study exchanges per day, lymphatic absorption decreased the potential daily drain volumes in the children by 27 +/- 5% and daily peritoneal urea and creatinine clearances by 24 +/- 4% and 22 +/- 5%, respectively. Compared with four hour exchanges using two liters of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution in 10 adult CAPD patients with average peritoneal transport, the children had more rapid equilibration of urea, greater absorption of dialysate glucose, higher lymphatic absorption and lower net ultrafiltration (P less than 0.01 to P less than 0.05). Lymphatic absorption therefore causes a relatively greater reduction in net ultrafiltration and solute clearances in children than in adults.\r"

Since the glomerular ultrafiltration area is an important determinant of GFR and has been proposed to be regulated by mesangial (MS) cell contraction, we examined the effect of CsA on arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced Ca2+ mobilization and contraction in cultured MS cells. Intracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, concentrations were measured using quin 2. Basal levels were not affected by CsA (151.1 +/- 6.2 vs. 145.2 +/- 5.8 nM, NS), but 10 micrograms/ml CsA significantly augmented the 10(-8) M AVP-induced increase of [Ca2+]i (delta 94.5 +/- 6.6 vs delta 167.3 +/- 8.4 nM, P less than 0.01). This effect was also seen in Ca2+-free medium (P less than 0.01). The effect of CsA on [Ca2+]i was not due to an inhibition of 45Ca2+ efflux, since AVP-induced increase of 45Ca2+ efflux at 30 seconds was enhanced in cells pretreated with CsA (1630 +/- 185 vs. 3646 +/- 197 cpm/mg prot/30 sec, P less than 0.01).

During a four hour hemodialysis the F-80 dialyzer returned plasma Al levels to pre-DFO values (103 +/- 36 vs. 93 +/- 23, P less than 0.05), suggesting complete removal of the DFO chelated Al complex. In one patient Al removal was evaluated using cuprophane, F-40, F-60 and F-80 dialyzers and the t 1/2 for Al removed decreased from 484.6 to 276.1 and 108 to 99 minutes, respectively. These data show the Fresenius F-80 polysulfone dialyzer effects the rapid removal of DFO-Al complexes.

In order to test this hypothesis in vivo, we determined the ability of the kidney to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II by measuring the decrease in renal cortical blood flow (RCBF) in response to exogenous angiotensin I administration. Changes in RCBF were monitored by laser-Doppler velocimetry. Three groups of rats were studied: Group I, controls (N = 7); 24 hours prior to study Group II animals were injected with 50% glycerol, 8 ml/kg i.m.

Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the left and right kidney in control rats was 0.7 and 0.7 ml/min, respectively. Twenty-four hours after glycerol, GFR was 0.2 ml/min in the left kidney and 0.2 ml/min in the right kidney. In HgCl2 treated rats GFR was 0.1 ml/min in the left kidney and 0.1 ml/min in the right kidney. Each of the following maneuvers elicited a similar rise in blood pressure in Groups I through III. Specifically, when first angiotensin I (4 micrograms/kg/min) was infused for three minutes; second, when 10 minutes later angiotensin I (5 micrograms) was directly applied on the left kidney; and third, when angiotensin II (5 micrograms) was topically administered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mi respiratory control ratio and ADP/O were similar in both experimental groups. Kinetic parameters for calcium uptake (Ca2+ concentrations in the medium of 1.25 to 16 microM) revealed initial velocities 1.5-fold higher in SNX Mi than in C. Mi retention of calcium in the presence of medium Ca2+ concentrations up to 500 microM was studied. Calcium retention was reduced in SNX: the Mi were unable to retain calcium at concentrations of 250 microM. The addition of ruthenium red to the medium substantially improved calcium retention by the uremic Mi.

The tracer was planted in the left kidney either in the subepithelial layer of the glomerular capillary wall or on the endothelium and lamina rara interna. Subepithelial immune complex formation resulted in non-inflammatory injury with heterologous and autologous proteinuric phases (115 +/- 16 mg/24 hrs on day 2; 183 +/- 16 mg/24 hrs on day 9) lasting four to five weeks. The glomerular filtration rate of the experimental left kidney was reduced by 19% at day 3, and was increased by 20% at day 12 over right kidney values. Immune complexes persisted for more than seven weeks in the lamina rara externa. In contrast, immune complex deposition on the endothelium and in the lamina rara interna led to acute transient anuria, with a 38% drop in glomerular filtration rate at one hour, massive platelet accumulation, followed by a strong inflammatory response. Proteinuria did not develop. Functional and structural integrity was restored within 24 hours, with complete clearing of immune deposits. We conclude that the distribution of exogenous antigens within the capillary wall determines the structural and functional expression of immune-mediated glomerular diseases.\r"

Using these methods, 97.3% of all rats studied achieved stable levels of severe hyponatremia (plasma [Na+] = 111.6 +/- 0.5 mEq/liter, N = 213), which was sustained for periods of time ranging from two to five weeks. Mortality was low (1.8%) and observable morbidity was not noted over a series of studies encompassing 4,628 rat days of sustained hypoosmolality. Analysis of food intake and body weight revealed no evidence of tissue catabolism at any time with the lower (1 ng/hr) DDAVP infusion rate, and only during the first week with the higher (5 ng/hr) rate. Metabolic balance studies during 13 days of sustained hypoosmolality demonstrated the dilutional nature of the hypoosmolality, and only a limited degree of renal escape from the antidiuretic effects of DDAVP (urine osmolalities 800 to 1200 mOsm/kg H2O). Studies of brain water and electrolyte contents demonstrated complete normalization of brain volume after 14 to 28 days of sustained hypoosmolality, the major part of which (70%) could be accounted for by loss of brain electrolytes. Both natriuresis and kaliuresis occurred during the first five days of hypoosmolality, and were of sufficient magnitude to suggest some degree of adaptation of other body fluid compartments via electrolyte losses as well. These results indicate that rats have substantial capacity to tolerate prolonged severe hypoosmolality with little morbidity and mortality as long as proper attention is paid to their nutritional requirements, and provide further evidence that brain volume regulation likely represents the major adaptive mechanism that allows survival despite sustained hypoosmolality.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to identify the factor(s) that characterize impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. We studied 34 patients, measuring systemic hemodynamics, vasoactive hormones, and sodium and volume status. Renal plasma flow (para-aminohippurate) and GFR (inulin) were assessed by steady-state clearance techniques. Both linear and multiple regression analyses were performed. Impaired GFR was characterized by reduction of renal blood flow and renal fraction of cardiac output, and by an increase of renal vascular resistance. The correlation between GFR and filtration fraction (r = 0.492, P less than 0.003) indicated that individuals with greatest impairment of GFR had the lowest filtration fraction and increased overall renal vascular resistance, indicating dependence of GFR on afferent, rather than efferent vasoconstriction, under conditions of low renal perfusion. Mean vasoactive hormones and blood volume were increased, but without clear cut correlation with GFR. The greatest impairment of GFR was observed in elderly CHF patients, as renal blood flow and function demonstrated an age-dependent decline, in addition to the adverse effects of CHF. In a multiple regression model, renal blood flow and filtration fraction accounted for 69% and 25%, respectively, of the variability of GFR, with a co-linear influence of age. Thus, we have identified age-related, abnormal renal hemodynamic patterns in CHF, and the fragile nature of GFR in the elderly CHF population.\r"

  ".W": "Renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity is tightly regulated in normal humans and intact animals. No significant changes in serum 1,25(OH)2D levels occur in response to vitamin D challenge. However, conflicting reports have appeared in the literature with regard to stimulation of 1,25(OH)2D production after 25(OH)D administration in uremia. To provide further insight into this issue, 25(OH)D at a dose of 100 micrograms every other day for two weeks followed by 50 micrograms every other day for the next two weeks was given orally to seven uremic mongrel dogs. After two weeks of 25(OH)D therapy, 1,25(OH)2D levels increased from 16.4 +/- 0.9 to 28.0 +/- 1.9 pg/ml (P less than 0.001) in parallel with a fourfold increase in 25(OH)D concentrations from a basal of 50.1 +/- 6.5 to 203.2 +/- 18.1 ng/ml. No significant changes in serum i-PTH, ICa or P were observed. Linear regression analysis of the relationship between serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D versus 25(OH)D, for each dog during this period, showed highly significant correlation coefficients. To evaluate the possibility that extra-renal sites contribute to the described enhanced 1,25(OH)2D net synthesis after 25(OH)D treatment, similar studies were performed in four anephric patients undergoing hemodialysis. Basal serum 1,25(OH)2D levels were 5.5 +/- 2.4 pg/ml and increased to 19.6 +/- 5.0 pg/ml after 25(OH)D administration. A significant correlation was also found for the relationship between serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D in anephrics (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001). The same therapy in four normal volunteers showed no significant changes in serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Clinical data from 246 patients presenting with a nephrotic syndrome and biopsy-proven glomerular disorder were analyzed, using statistical survival techniques, to determine which of several variables (sex, age, plasma creatinine, diastolic blood pressure and 24-hour urinary protein loss) were associated with subsequent end-stage renal failure. The best prediction of outcome could be made at one year (N = 121); then plasma creatinine (P less than 0.001) and heavy proteinuria (P = 0.049) were the best determinants. For a given plasma creatinine level, heavy urinary protein was associated with a worse outcome. The incidence of end-stage renal failure was greatest three to four years from the date edema first developed. Plasma creatinine and urinary protein values, collected four-monthly throughout the study period, were analyzed as time-dependent covariates. A relationship was found between the prevailing risk of renal failure and earlier heavy proteinuria (P less than 0.001). Spontaneous complete remission of proteinuria was associated with a highly favorable outcome (P = 0.001) and normal, or impaired but stable, renal function.\r"
