Extent of the disease may vary from a few isolated periapical lesions to diffuse involvement of the mandibular and maxillary alveolar processes. Radiographically, it is characterized by multiquadrant, globular, radiolucent-radiopaque lesions. Histopathologically, it is a benign fibro-osseous lesion that must be differentiated from other benign fibro-osseous lesions such as fibrous dysplasia, ossifying fibroma, Paget's disease, and sclerosing osteomyelitis on the basis of combined clinical, radiographic, and histological features. Correctly identifying this disease is important because it requires no treatment unless a secondary osteomyelitis develops. Sequestrae and osteomyelitis are complications arising when teeth are removed and removable dental prostheses are supported by diseased bone.\r"

  ".W": "Human mast cells, dispersed from lung tissue by proteolytic treatment and enriched to a purity of 23 to 68% by density-gradient centrifugation, were maintained ex vivo for up to 13 days when co-cultured with mouse skin-derived 3T3 fibroblasts in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The human mast cells were adherent to the fibroblast cultures within 2 to 4 hr after seeding, and after 7 days of co-culture were localized between the layers of fibroblasts. The cell surfaces of the mast cells and the fibroblasts did not form tight junctions, but rather approached within 20 nm of each other. The co-cultured mast cells did not divide; they maintained their cellular content of histamine and TAMe esterase and resembled in vivo mast cells in that their secretory granules exhibited scroll patterns and their nuclei were oval. Both the freshly isolated and the co-cultured mast cells responded to activation with anti-human IgE by exocytosing histamine and generating and releasing arachidonic acid metabolites. When freshly isolated mast cells were activated immunologically, they exocytosed 38 +/- 8% of their total histamine content and released 28 +/- 1.9 ng (mean +/- range, n = 2) of immunoreactive equivalents of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) per microgram of total cellular histamine, but did not generate significant amounts of either leukotriene C4 (LTC4) or leukotriene B4 (LTB4). The 1-wk co-cultured mast cells, on the other hand, exocytosed 43 +/- 2.4% of their total histamine content, and released 86 +/- 10, 43 +/- 20, and 5.2 +/- 5.2 ng (mean +/- SD, n = 4) of immunoreactive equivalents of PGD2, LTC4, and LTB4, respectively, per microgram of histamine. Thus, human lung-derived mast cells can be maintained ex vivo when co-cultured with fibroblasts, and, when treated with anti-IgE, they metabolize arachidonic acid via both the cyclooxygenase and the 5-lipoxygenase pathways.\r"

Hybridization analysis and preliminary sequence analysis indicate that one of these clones is structurally related to HLA-DP alpha, one to -DR alpha, one to -DQ alpha and one to -DZ alpha. Probes specific for the four class II genes were used to screen RNA samples from normal rabbit tissues to determine which of these genes are transcribed and whether expression of any particular gene is tissue specific. All four of the genes are transcribed, but there are variations in the levels of expression, in tissue distribution, and in transcript size. The highest levels of RLA-DR alpha, -DQ alpha, and -DP alpha transcription were found in lymphoid tissues. Lower levels of transcription were also detectable in several nonlymphoid tissues. Transcripts observed were about 1.3 kb, a size expected for these class II alpha-chain genes based on experience with their human homologues. The RLA-DZ alpha probe corresponding to HLA-DZ alpha hybridized weakly with a band of 3.6 kb; its expression could be detected only in lymphoid tissues. The size of the DZ alpha transcript, its tissue distribution, and partial sequence data confirm its homology with the human gene DZ alpha. In blots of total cellular RNA, a probe for a recently described human beta-chain, DO beta, hybridized to a transcript of about 1.3 kb in lymphoid tissues. These data indicate that RNA transcripts corresponding to all HLA class II loci described to date can be detected in rabbit tissues.\r"

We have previously described that these autoantibodies are relatively restricted to the IgG2a isotype. In the current study, we analyze the isotype distribution of anti-Sm antibodies in these mice over time. The most common pattern observed was an initial response of the IgG2a isotype, which progressed such that this isotype was the major one at the time of peak response. No IgM to IgG class switch was observed. Additional studies directed at the clonality of the anti-Sm response indicated that both kappa- and lambda-light chains could be involved, and that the isoelectric focusing pattern of the anti-Sm antibodies was in general characteristic of multiple spectrotypes. These results also support a special role for the IgG2a isotype in the anti-Sm response in MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mice. Despite this heavy chain isotype restriction, the response usually evidences substantial diversity, which suggests either multiple B cell clones or somatic mutation of antibody variable region genes.\r"

In vivo chemotactic responses returned to normal within 2 months of cessation of treatment. Biopsies of skin chamber sites from patients on isotretinoin showed no significant dermal or epidermal leukocytic accumulation in response to autologous zymosan-activated serum, whereas chambers from controls showed extensive neutrophilic infiltrates even in the epidermis. In contrast, in vitro chemotactic responses of neutrophils and monocytes from patients on isotretinoin were not diminished. Sera and plasma from patients on isotretinoin contained no inhibitors of chemotaxis, and activated sera from these patients were excellent attractants for normal monocytes. We postulate that isotretinoin produces significant anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis across intact biologic barriers in vivo.\r"

We selected hydrophilic amino acid sequences encoded by conserved regions of the gag, pol, and env genes of HIV as potential antigenic domains. Eighteen peptides representing these sequences were synthesized; the peptides elicited strong antibody responses in rabbits. Sera from 53 HIV-infected patients and 50 controls were tested against the synthetic peptides. Although no antibodies to peptides from gag, pol, or env gp120 proteins were present, antibodies to four of the six peptides from env gp41 were detected. Epitope mapping using overlapping peptides showed that sera from 53 (100%) of 53 HIV-infected patients (and from none of 50 controls) reacted with peptides aa584-609 and aa598-609 from gp41, sera from 32 (60%) of 53 patients reacted with peptide aa603-614, and sera from 19 (35%) of 53 patients reacted with peptides aa609-620. Thus, amino acid sequence LeuGlyIleTrpGlyCysSerGlyLysLeuIleCys (aa598-609) from the transmembrane glycoprotein is an immunodominant domain of HIV recognized by serum antibodies from HIV-infected patients.\r"

Cells from 17 patients were studied by the semisolid technique, and cells from seven patients by both liquid and semisolid cultures. After incubation in liquid culture with 1,25(OH)2D3, in six of seven patients evaluated an increasing number of myeloid cells (185% to 470%) acquired the morphologic appearance of mature monocyte-macrophages, and a decrease in the number of immature myeloid cells (26% to 75%) was observed. Phagocytosis and killing of Candida albicans by monocyte-macrophages incubated with 1,25(OH)2D3 were normal and similar to those processes in untreated cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the percentage of monocytes that phagocytosed C. albicans in three patients. Thirteen of 17 patients showed reduced myeloid cloning, and eight showed increased cluster formation. Cloning efficiency was significantly lower in patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Concentrations of 2 X 10(-9) to 2 X 10(-8) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 and 10(-8) to 10(-7) mol/L retinoic acid had a stimulatory effect on myeloid colony growth in five of the six patients with sideroblastic and refractory anemia, but in only two of the 11 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The results indicate that the differentiation pattern of myeloid precursor cells from a subset of patients with MDS was altered by exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3.\r"

  ".W": "Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with an initial leukocyte count greater than or equal to 100 X 10(9)/L responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. To extend event-free survival (EFS) in this disease, we devised a protocol that specifies intensive 2-week courses of teniposide (VM-26, 165 mg/m2) plus cytarabine (ara-C, 300 mg/m2), before and immediately after standard 4-week remission induction therapy with prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase. The VM-26 and ara-C combination was also administered intermittently for the first year of continuation treatment with oral 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate. CNS prophylaxis consisted of periodic intrathecal (IT) injections of methotrexate and delayed cranial irradiation. At a median follow-up of 4 years, the estimated EFS rate for 57 consecutive patients with leukocyte counts of 100 to 1,000 X 10(9)/L was 44%, compared with 10% for matched controls (P less than .001). Remission induction rates in the two groups were similar (82% v 72%, P = .16). Twenty-five patients in the VM-26/ara-C group have survived without adverse events for 2.7 to 6.8 years, whereas only nine of the controls achieved more than a year of EFS. The most common complications during early treatment were acute hyperkalemia from rapid tumor cell lysis and infections due to prolonged marrow aplasia. Continuation chemotherapy was well tolerated. We conclude that VM-26 plus ara-C, added to each phase of an otherwise basic regimen of chemotherapy, will substantially improve prognosis in this high-risk form of childhood leukemia.\r"

Both protocols used an anthracycline with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) for induction therapy followed by 12 to 14 months of intensive sequential postremission chemotherapy. Results are similar for the two treatment regimens. Seventy-two percent of patients achieved a complete remission, with 42% projected 5-year disease-free survival for the complete responders. Monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemic subtype (French-American-British [FAB] types M4 and M5), WBC count less than 100,000/microL, and age less than 2 years at diagnosis all predicted increased risk of relapse and decreased overall survival in univariate analyses. FAB subtype and high white count continued to predict for an increased risk of relapse in multivariate analyses and only M5 leukemic subtype independently predicted for poor survival. Patients with M4 or M5 leukemic subtype had a higher incidence of initial relapses in the CNS. The addition of intrathecal cytosine arabinoside in the second protocol, 80-035, decreased the percentage of patients with initial failure in the CNS, but did not improve overall survival. Improved CNS prophylaxis, better systemic therapy, and/or different treatment strategies are needed to improve therapy in these high-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of acute leukemia in pregnancy is low and even referral centers have limited experience. Although the short-term risks for children exposed in utero to cytotoxic agents are predictable, there is no information on long-term complications. We report here our experience in the treatment of seven cases of acute leukemia diagnosed during pregnancy, and a literature review of 51 cases published since 1975. Fifty-three patients received chemotherapy during their pregnancies. Forty-nine of the 58 cases resulted in the birth of 50 live infants. Twenty-eight infants were born prematurely, and four had low birth-weights for their gestational age. Thirty-three percent of the newborns exposed to chemotherapy in the last month of pregnancy were cytopenic at birth, but other perinatal complications were not increased. Only one child (present series) had obvious congenital malformations, and this same infant later developed a neuroblastoma arising in the adrenal gland and a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Follow-up data are not provided in most previously reported cases, but long-term follow-up of our cases from 1 to 17 years has shown normal growth and development and no further malignancies. A central registry is strongly advised in order to document the long-term complications arising in children exposed to chemotherapy in utero.\r"

Amplification of c-myc and c-erbB-2, and allelic deletions of c-ras-Ha and c-myb were the most common abnormalities. The presence of altered proto-oncogenes correlated with clinical stage of the cancers. Fifteen of 43 evaluable tumors of stages I to III recurred, and four of five evaluable stage IV tumors progressed within 16 to 24 months of surgery. All but one of the cancers that recurred or progressed had detectably altered proto-oncogenes (P less than .001). Analysis of proto-oncogenes may have prognostic value in breast cancer.\r"

Few studies have directly compared the two techniques in a prospective manner. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate complications seen with wire osteosynthesis versus a small bone plating system in management of mandibular fractures. The results suggest that small bone plating systems similar to the one used in this study may serve as a suitable alternative to wire osteosynthesis for the management of mandibular parasymphysis, body, and angle fractures. The length of the procedure, the length of hospital stay, and patient comfort were comparable with the two techniques. Factors that may contribute to failure are: location of the fracture, poor patient compliance, length of time from the trauma to the repair, antibiotic choice, and most importantly, operator skill and experience.\r"

Four months later, congestive heart failure developed, with recurrent chylous pleural effusions, and she died at age 8 1/2 years. Endomyocardial biopsy tissue showed abundant PAS-positive, diastase-resistant cytoplasmic deposits. Similar inclusions were seen in muscle, skin, and liver specimens. Postmortem studies showed that the abnormal polysaccharide was especially abundant in heart and muscle, but was also present in all other tissues, including the central nervous system. Glycogen isolated from heart, muscle, and spinal cord showed a shift of the iodine spectrum toward higher than normal wavelengths. Branching enzyme activity was lacking in the muscle biopsy specimen and in all postmortem tissues; glycogenolytic enzymes had normal activities. These studies show that cardiomyopathy can be the first symptom of generalized branching enzyme deficiency and that the degree of accumulation of the abnormal polysaccharide may vary in different tissues.\r"

The use of autopsy to assess technological methods of diagnosis seems to be a reasonable expectation. Methods of reimbursement to validate autopsy as a medical act should be sought, and voluntary and government regulation to assure the role of autopsy in quality assurance programs is suggested.\r"

BCM was greater in normal males than in females. In both normal males and females, the BCM tended to decrease with age, both as an absolute measure and as a percentage of body weight. Anorexia nervosa patients experienced marked weight loss (30.5%), and had significant depletion of absolute BCM, but exhibited relative sparing of BCM as indicated by a rise in BCM as a percentage of body weight. This may reflect a normal adaptation and predominant fat utilization in chronic malnutrition. The cancer patients, on the other hand, had significant weight loss (12.7% for females, 13.9% for males) and demonstrated a proportional decline in BCM, with no change in BCM as a percentage of body weight. These findings support the contention that, in the cancer-bearing patient, weight loss consists of a significant depletion of both fat and BCM. The challenge to the clinicians caring for cancer patients is repletion of this supremely functional body compartment.\r"

  ".W": "A population-based case-control interview study of thyroid cancer (159 cases and 285 controls) was conducted in Connecticut. Prior radiotherapy to the head or neck was reported by 12% of the cases and 4% of the controls [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-6.9]. Risk was inversely related to age at irradiation and was highest among children exposed under age 10. Few persons born after 1945 received prior radiotherapy, consistent with the declining use of radiation to treat benign conditions in the 1950's. Among females the radiogenic risk appeared to be potentiated by the number of subsequent live-births. Other significant risk factors included a history of benign thyroid nodules (OR = 33) or goiter (OR = 5.6). Miscarriage and multiparity increased risk but only among women who developed thyroid cancer before age 35 years. Consumption of shellfish (a rich source of iodine) seemed to increase the risk of follicular thyroid cancer, whereas consumption of goitrogen-containing vegetables appeared to reduce risk of total thyroid cancer, possibly because of their cruciferous nature. A significantly low risk was observed among persons of English descent, whereas Italian ancestry appeared to increase risk. No significant associations were found with a number of suspected risk factors: diagnostic x-rays, radioactive isotope scans, occupational radiation exposure, tonsillectomy, Jewish ethnicity, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, oral contraceptives, lactation suppressants, menopausal estrogens, most other common medications, and water source. New associations were suggested for obesity among females (OR = 1.5), surgically treated benign breast disease (OR = 1.6), use of spironolactone (OR = 4.3) or vitamin D supplements (OR = 1.8), and a family history of thyroid cancer (OR = 5.2). About 9% of the incident thyroid cancers could be attributed to prior head and neck irradiation, 4% to goiter, and 17% to thyroid nodular disease, leaving the etiology of most thyroid cancers yet to be explained.\r"

The stored sera of the 280 cases and of 293 randomly selected controls were tested to determine their levels of selenium. There was no association of serum selenium with lung, stomach, or rectal cancer. An increase in relative risk (RR) was noted only for subjects in the lowest quintile of selenium values, as compared to the RR for subjects in the highest quintile, for colon (RR = 1.8) and urinary bladder cancer (RR = 3.1), but neither of these RR estimates was statistically significant (P = .09 and P = .07, respectively). Further work is needed to determine whether the antioxidant properties of selenium protect against specific types of cancer.\r"

The ACNU-resistant 9L/R cells appeared to be about 16 times more resistant against ACNU than were the 9L cells. The DNA cross-links immediately after the treatment with ACNU were not detectable in 9L or 9L/R cells. Although the level of cross-links for 9L cells had reached a maximum at 6 hours and then persisted at almost the same level as that at 24 hours after the treatment with ACNU, the level for 9L/R cells was very low at 6 hours and then gradually decreased at 24 hours after treatment with ACNU. Inhibition of the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links caused by the treatment with ACNU might be a factor for the ACNU resistance in 9L/R cells. Also, the capacity for the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links might participate in the mechanisms of the ACNU resistance in 9L/R cells.\r"

Symptomatic tumor-bearing rats were studied with double-label quantitative autoradiography to concurrently measure blood flow and a unidirectional blood-to-tissue transfer constant (K) for alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). A net extraction fraction (En) was calculated from the measured values for blood flow and K. Mean whole tumor blood flow was 53.5 +/- 4.9 ml/100 g/min (mean +/- SEM), which was significantly less than the blood flow to the tumor-free cortex (198 +/- 15.5 ml/100 g/min) but not significantly different from the blood flow in the tumor-free corpus callosum (50.6 +/- 4.3 ml/100 g/min). Mean whole tumor K-value for AIB was 5.8 +/- 0.5 ml/100 g/min, approximately 30 times the K-value for tumor-free brain. The calculated mean whole tumor En was 0.2 +/- 0.09, nearly 100 times the value for the tumor-free brain. Regionally, blood flow was lower in the tumor center and higher in its tumor periphery, although the difference was not significant. Both K- and En-values were significantly higher for the tumor center and decreased radially for the areas from center out. The values for K and En of AIB in the D-54MG gliomas are the highest of any experimental brain tumor model studied to date and indicate that in some tumor regions in this model, blood-to-tissue transport of the water-soluble compound AIB may be dependent on blood flow as well as on the permeability-surface area product of the tumor capillaries.\r"

Altogether, 27 employment categories had a smoking-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.3 or greater; five of these with significantly high OR contributed to an occupational population attributable risk of 13%. Masons and tilesetters; janitors and cleaners; printing workers; and trucking service, warehousing, and storage workers had significantly high risks overall and for longer durations of employment. Shipbuilding workers had significantly high risk overall and for short duration of employment. Although the excess risk for all shipbuilding workers was primarily among those with reported exposure to asbestos, the risk was also high among welders, burners, sheet metal workers, and boilermakers with no reported asbestos exposure.\r"

  ".W": "Human melanoma cell lines inoculated ip in outbred nude mice were found to activate locally macrophages, which became tumoricidal for the EL 4 target cells in a 48-hour [3H]thymidine cytotoxicity assay. However, the kinetics of this activation largely depended on the tumorigenicity of the cell line used. One week after inoculation with a poorly tumorigenic cell line (PTCL), peritoneal macrophages showed a maximal tumoricidal activity, which then slowly declined to disappear on the 4th week. Macrophages obtained after inoculation of a highly tumorigenic cell line (HTCL) were also activated, but the level of their tumoricidal activity was somewhat lower and decreased more rapidly. Irradiated melanoma cells were also able to activate peritoneal macrophages. The inoculation of a higher number of melanoma cells (less than or equal to 8 X 10(7) cells) resulted in a parallel increase in the cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages when activated by PTCL and in a parallel decrease when activated by HTCL. Activated macrophages taken 1 week after tumor cell inoculation and further kept in vitro without additional stimulation progressively lost their tumoricidal activity, within 48 hours after being harvested from PTCL-inoculated mice and within 24 hours after being collected from HTCL-inoculated animals. These data allied to the in vivo capacity of peritoneal cells rich in activated macrophages to prevent the growth of HTCL in nude mice strongly leaned toward the idea that macrophages are involved in the tumor growth control in the absence of a specific immune response. In addition, tumor-macrophage interactions are likely to vary from tumor to tumor and may contribute to the expression of the xenografting capacity of human tumor cells.\r"

The hepatocellular lesions consisted of focal populations of altered cells and neoplasms, of clear-cell and basophilic morphologic appearance.

The animals were fed semipurified diets containing levels of retinyl acetate, which were adequate (2.2 mg/kg diet), deficient (0.30 mg/kg diet), or supplemented (29.9 mg/kg diet) with respect to vitamin A content. Carcinogen-treated rats received 2.5 mg MBN/kg (body wt) twice a week for 5 weeks; they were then sacrificed for evaluation of esophageal tumorigenesis 15 weeks later. Liver levels of retinol reflected vitamin A nutriture, but there were no clinical signs of deficiency or toxicity. There were no significant differences in the frequency or incidence of esophageal tumors (either carcinomas or papillomas) among the dietary groups. There was also no indication that either vitamin A deficiency or vitamin A supplementation influenced the formation of preneoplastic lesions. Although the time was short for the neoplastic development, tumors were observed. These data suggest that vitamin A is selective in tissues it may protect from cancer induction and that the esophagus is less involved than other tissues.\r"

In the presence of 10(-7) g/ml tetrodotoxin, following the release of 500-millisecond conditioning hyperpolarization, the cells exhibited Ca2+-dependent action potentials. Local application to N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells of cisplatin (cis-PDD) for 30 seconds from a drug-containing effusion pipette produced a dose-dependent reversible inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent action potential, with a 61% inhibition at 1.7 microM and 67% inhibition at 17 microM cis-PDD. trans-Dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) and platinic(IV) chloride, both of which lacked the growth inhibitory properties of cis-PDD against N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, at concentrations of 170 and 120 microM produced only an 11 and 19% inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent action potential, respectively. Vincristine at a concentration of 1 microM reversibly inhibited the Ca2+-dependent action potential by 48%. 3'-Deamino-3'-(3''-cyano-4''-morpholinyl)doxorubicin, a more potent experimental antitumor agent than doxorubicin, at 10(-8) M inhibited the Ca2+-dependent action potential by 22%, similar to the inhibition previously reported for doxorubicin. None of the agents affected the cell transmembrane potential, which suggests a lack of an effect on the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the resting cell membrane potential difference. The effects of the agents on the Ca2+-dependent action potential might reflect a direct effect on a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel or on the lipid domain around the channels, or they might be produced by changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, among other mechanisms. It is not known whether a change in the membrane Ca2+ current is related to the antitumor effects of the agents, but such a change may contribute to the neurotoxicity of cis-PDD and vincristine and the cardiac toxicity of the anthracycline.\r"

Effects of chronic feeding of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDC) were tested on cell proliferation in the colon of male noninbred Wistar rats. By use of a dynamic method measuring actual rates of cell production, proliferation was modulated by both bile acids only in the proximal part of the colon. UDC feeding produced mild hyperproliferation of basal crypt cells (cell position 5-8: 7.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.3 cells/1,000 cells/hr--P less than .05; cell position 9-12: 18.1 +/- 10.7 vs. 10.3 +/- 2.9--P less than .05; cell position 13-16: 18.1 +/- 8.9 vs. 9.1 +/- 2.3--P less than .05). This finding reflected a characteristic compensatory response to superficial cell damage. However, CDC application did not effect cell regeneration in this crypt area but led to a striking drop of cell renewal in higher crypt cell positions (positions greater than or equal to 17), where no proliferation was detectable. These data suggest that CDC exerts its tumor-promoting effect by other means than hyperproliferation.\r"

  ".W": "Two retrovirus-associated pulmonary diseases of sheep [ovine pulmonary carcinoma (OPC); sheep pulmonary adenomatosis], a bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) were induced simultaneously in 9 of 9 neonatal lambs. The lambs were killed 8-28 weeks after intratracheal injection of lung tumor homogenate or lung fluid derived from sheep with naturally occurring OPC and ovine lentivirus (OvLV) infection. The inoculated lambs developed multifocal neoplasms of alveolar type II cells or nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, LIP, and pulmonary lymph node hyperplasia, and all produced antibody to OvLV. OvLV was isolated from 6 to 7 lambs tested, and infectious center assay of pulmonary lavage cells from 3 lambs revealed that approximately 1 in 1,000 pulmonary lavage cells contained infectious lentivirus. Neither contact control lambs nor control lambs that received ultrafiltered lung fluid developed evidence of either disease or of OvLV infection. Lung fluid or tumor tissue of lambs with OPC contained a 26,000-dalton protein that cross-reacted with antiserum to p27 to Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, a type D retrovirus. The fact that no antigenic cross-reaction between OvLV and type D retroviruses has been demonstrated supports the presence of two retroviruses in sheep with OPC. Although the contributions of each agent to oncogenesis in this model are difficult to evaluate, the rapid development of two retrovirus-induced pulmonary diseases in experimentally inoculated lambs suggests an etiologic or pathogenetic synergism between these two members of the family Retroviridae.\r"

Each compound was tested for tumorigenicity in BALB/c mice by sc inoculation of 0.05 mg of the compound once a week for 20 weeks. Tumors developed at the site of injection of 1,8-DNP in 6 of 15 mice up to 60 weeks after the first injection. The incidence of tumors was statistically significant at a P-value of less than .05 but not of less than .01. Therefore, the carcinogenicity of 1,8-DNP in BALB/c mice was concluded to be weaker than that of benzo[a]pyrene [(BP) CAS: 50-32-8], which induced a 100% tumor incidence when it was injected at the same dose as that of 1,8-DNP. No tumors occurred at the injection site in mice given 1,3-DNP. Most of the tumors induced by 1,8-DNP and BP showed histologic features characteristic of malignant fibrous histiocytoma.\r"

Early first intercourse also was associated with some residual effect on risk, although the relationship was not linear, nor the explanation readily apparent. Those with multiple births were at significantly elevated risks, even after adjustment for sexual parameters. Menstrual and hygiene factors, including use of tampons, vaginal deodorants, and douching products, were not consistently related to risk. Histories of specific infections involving the genital tract were poor predictors of risk, since few women provided positive responses, but those with nonspecific diseases were at a significant twofold excess risk.\r"

Death rates increased with age and in every age group were roughly three times higher for males than for females. Over the period 1968-81, death rates increased for males aged 65 years or more, whereas death rates in other age-sex groupings remained fairly constant or declined slightly. It is known that asbestos is highly related to mesothelioma, and the increase in death rates among older males could be due to asbestos. Conversely, the fact that death rates in younger males and in females have not been increasing suggests some kind of background level not strongly related to the use of asbestos. When the geographic distribution of death rates was examined by state, there was considerable geographic variation with some clustering. High death rates for males appeared for the Northeastern States and along the Pacific Coast, and for Illinois, Florida, Wyoming, and Colorado. Females shared this geographic pattern to some extent. When death rates were examined by county, a relationship was seen between pleural mesothelioma deaths among males and the presence of asbestos products plants and shipbuilding facilities. Excessive death rates in some counties and states did not appear to be related to asbestos exposure. Although the similarity in geographic patterns of mortality for males and females suggests a common etiology, the trends in mortality suggest different etiologies. There may be important causes of pleural mesothelioma yet to be identified.\r"

The mothers and fathers of acute leukemia cases and their individually matched controls were interviewed regarding specific occupational and home exposures as well as other potential risk factors associated with leukemia. Analysis of the information from the 123 matched pairs showed an increased risk of leukemia for children whose fathers had occupational exposure after the birth of the child to chlorinated solvents [odds ratio (OR) = 3.5, P = .01], spray paint (OR = 2.0, P = .02), dyes or pigments (OR = 4.5, P = .03), methyl ethyl ketone (CAS: 78-93-3; OR = 3.0, P = .05), and cutting oil (OR = 1.7, P = .05) or whose fathers were exposed during the mother's pregnancy with the child to spray paint (OR = 2.2, P = .03). For all of these, the risk associated with frequent use was greater than for infrequent use. There was an increased risk of leukemia for the child if the father worked in industries manufacturing transportation equipment (mostly aircraft) (OR = 2.5, P = .03) or machinery (OR = 3.0, P = .02). An increased risk was found for children whose parents used pesticides in the home (OR = 3.8, P = .004) or garden (OR = 6.5, P = .007) or who burned incense in the home (OR = 2.7, P = .007). The risk was greater for frequent use. Risk of leukemia was related to mothers' employment in personal service industries (OR = 2.7, P = .04) but not to specified occupational exposures. Risk related to fathers' exposure to chlorinated solvents, employment in the transportation equipment-manufacturing industry, and parents' exposure to household or garden pesticides and incense remains statistically significant after adjusting for the other significant findings.\r"

  ".W": "For 1950-80, 194 ovarian cancer cases were ascertained among the 70,030 females of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation's Life-Span Study E-85 sample, and 106 autopsied cases with benign ovarian neoplasms were ascertained among all 3,046 autopsies performed in the same sample. On the basis of microscopic review, 66% of the cancer and 84% of the benign tumor cases were classified by histologic type. The age-adjusted ovarian cancer incidence rates showed a statistically significant increase with increased exposure dose, both in the entire exposed group (P less than .01) and in the microscopically reviewed subset (P less than .01). This dose response was only significant (P less than .01) in the latter half of the study period, 1965-80. The radiation effect was higher in the younger age group at the time of the bomb (ATB) for the specific attained age or was adjusted for attained age. In general, relative risk (greater than or equal to 100 rad vs. 0 rad) did not differ by attained age, except for the youngest age group, less than 20 years old ATB, where the relative risk tended to decrease with increased attained age, although cases were few in number and follow-up study was necessary. Estimated minimum latent period for radiation-induced ovarian cancer seemed to be 15-20 years. The proportion of autopsied cases with benign ovarian tumor increased with increasing exposure dose, both in the entire series of cases (P less than .05) and in the microscopically reviewed subset. Statistical significance, however, was not achieved in the latter group (P greater than .10). The distribution of histologic types of both cancer and benign tumor of the ovary did not vary significantly with radiation dose. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that radiation injury of the ovaries and secondary excess of gonadotropic hormones are important causative factors in the development of ovarian neoplasms.\r"

  ".W": "Prolonged exposure to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] of 2 sublines (AB-2 and AB-26) of human promyelocytic HL 60 leukemia cells produced increased adherence of the cells to the culture substratum. Advantage was taken of this property to separate physically a population of cells highly enriched in macrophage-like forms. When these differentiated cells were placed in culture medium free of 1,25(OH)2D3, there was a rapid reversal of the features of the differentiated phenotype, monitored by the loss of alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase activity and the loss of adherence to the substrate. The reversal was accompanied by the resumption of normal rates of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and reaccumulation of c-myc and c-myb transcripts. The levels of transcripts of oncogenes c-fos and c-fms, which became abundant in the phenotypically differentiated cultures, declined along with the loss of adhesiveness and reversion to more primitive myeloblastic forms. These changes in proto-oncogene expression became evident before cell proliferation resumed, thereby excluding the diluting effect of the outgrowth of undifferentiated cells. It is concluded that in this system there is no firm commitment to terminal, as opposed to early, differentiation in the great majority of the cells and that the expression of the monocytic maturation-associated genes c-fos and c-fms is down-regulated when macrophage-like cells dedifferentiate. This strengthens the case for an association between macrophage differentiation and the expression of oncogenes c-fos and c-fms.\r"

The concentrations of specific biochemical markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, aspartate aminotransferase, and immunoglobulin, were higher in the pericellular culture medium in capillary culture. The capillary environment influenced the expression of biochemical heterogeneity by the DLD-1 colon carcinoma cell line and its derivative clones. Spontaneous differentiation of K562 leukemia cells was increased in the capillary system. These results indicate that the artificial capillary is a useful and relevant system for the study of cultured human tumor cells.\r"

The increase of adenocarcinoma was mostly confined to females 20-34 years of age. The decrease in incidence rates of undifferentiated cancer was observed in all age groups, whereas the fall in incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma was demonstrated in females above 35 years of age only. Of all patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 55% were diagnosed in clinical stage I. Females with adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated cancer were diagnosed in stage I in 60 and 38% of the cases, respectively.

No significant antibody reactions were found for sera from 30 cancer patients by the immunoblotting assay, and comparative ELISA studies of 111 patients with malignant mastopathies and 122 healthy, age-matched women revealed no significantly increased mean antibody responses against gp55, gp34, p28, or p12 in breast cancer patients as compared to the responses in the control group. Only for p18 was there a significant increase in mean IgG-binding levels in cancer patients. Additional assays of antibody binding to viral antigens were performed by the cellular immunofluorescence test on MuMTV-expressing cells. These studies also failed to demonstrate greater immunoreactivity of sera from patients as opposed to the immunoreactivity of sera from healthy controls.\r"

Cytotoxicities of cisplatin and doxorubicin were assessed by inhibition of colony-forming ability during continuous exposure to a range of drug concentrations. The ranges of the drug concentrations required to kill 70% of clonogenic cells obtained against the testicular cell lines were 1-7 ng/ml and 21-161 ng/ml for doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively, compared with 4-19 ng/ml and 112-431 ng/ml for the bladder cell lines. This study shows that continuous cell lines retain the relative clinical chemosensitivities of their tumors of origin.

Next-of-kin of 435 white men who died of a primary brain tumor and of 386 controls who died from other causes were interviewed to obtain information on lifetime occupational history and other factors that might be related to excess brain tumor risk. The relative risk (RR) for all brain tumors was elevated among men exposed to MW/RF radiation [RR = 1.6; 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.0, 2.4] and was significantly elevated among men exposed for 20 or more years. All of the excess risk for MW/RF radiation-exposed subjects was derived from jobs that involved the design, manufacture, repair, or installation of electrical or electronic equipment (RR = 2.3; 95% Cl = 1.3, 4.2), while risk of brain tumors among MW/RF radiation-exposed subjects who never worked in electrical or electronics jobs was not elevated (RR = 1.0; 95% Cl = 0.5, 1.9). Furthermore, risk was elevated for electronics workers who were considered to have no exposure to MW/RF radiation. Among electrical and electronics workers, risk was highest for engineers, teachers, technicians, repairers, and assemblers combined (RR = 3.9; 95% Cl = 1.6, 9.9) and was limited to excess risk from astrocytic tumors (RR = 4.6; 95% Cl = 1.9, 12.2). Risk of astrocytic tumors among these electronics manufacture and repair workers increased with duration of exposure to tenfold among those employed for 20 or more years. Among electricians and power and telephone linemen combined (electrical tradesmen), the RR for astrocytic tumors was slightly elevated, but not statistically significant (RR = 1.8), and showed no consistent evidence of a duration-response relationship. Electrical tradesmen are exposed to extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation, while men in some jobs associated with electronics manufacture and repair are exposed to electromagnetic radiation in the very high frequency and ultra-high frequency ranges and also may be exposed to soldering fumes, solvents, and a variety of other chemicals.\r"

For women age 25-44 years (n = 1,869 cases), the incidence of breast cancer increased by 22% (P less than .001) between the time periods 1974-77 and 1982-84. The estimated annual increase was 2.5% (P less than .001). The increase in incidence over time appeared to be greater among those residing in low-income census tracts of urban counties and among black women. Possible relationships between the observed increase in rates and trends of risk factors for breast cancer are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Aromatic amines contained in permanent hair dyes can be absorbed percutaneously and are mutagenic and carcinogenic in some laboratory studies. Concern has been raised that use of these dyes may increase the risk of human cancers. Therefore, the present study examined the relationship between permanent hair dye use and incidence of breast cancer among 118,404 U.S. women aged 30-55 years who were followed prospectively for 6 years. Among women who had ever used permanent hair dyes, 353 developed breast cancer during 246,848 person-years of follow-up, while 505 cases occurred during 397,460 person-years among never users (age-adjusted rate ratio = 1.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.9-1.2). Identical rate ratios were observed when women who had ever used hair dyes were subdivided into current and past users. Adjustment for known determinants of breast cancer in multivariate models did not alter these relationships. The risk of breast cancer did not increase with more frequent use, longer duration of use, or interval since first use. On the basis of these data and previous findings, it appears unlikely that the use of permanent hair dyes causes any important increase in risk of breast cancer.\r"

The hypothesis tested was that widowers and possibly divorced men were at higher risk for developing this cancer than were married men. Age- and marital-specific incidence rates were calculated for 4 age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and greater than or equal to 75 yr) for U.S. white, black, and Puerto Rico Hispanic men. Risks for other marital status groups were calculated relative to \"married.\" Among the 45-54 age group, all ethnic groups had an excess risk for widowed as compared to the risk for married men [whites, relative risk (RR) = 1.7; blacks, RR = 1.5; Hispanics, RR = 2.5]. These excesses were not significantly different from unity. In the other 3 age groups and among each ethnic group, among whom 97.3% of all prostate cancers occurred, there was no suggestion of an excess risk for the development of prostate cancer among widowed men relative to married men. Unexpected findings were significant deficits in risk for single, separated, and divorced white men as compared to the risk for married men. Thus this study does not support an association between widowerhood and an increased risk for the development of prostate cancer. Additional studies are required to investigate a suggestion of decreased risk for older, separated, and divorced men.\r"

Examination of the rats revealed an age-related increase in the induction of urinary bladder carcinoma, although the total intakes of BBN and urinary excretions of its proximate carcinogen were not age related. Rats treated with BBN at 98 weeks of age developed more squamous cell carcinomas and invasive carcinomas than the 2 younger groups.

Previous work has shown that the epitheliomas contain numerous hamster papovavirus (HaPV) particles, whereas lymphomas do not. Cells from both kinds of tumors do contain HaPV DNA sequences, however. In this study, Southern blot hybridization showed that complete, circular HaPV genomes were present in these cells. Complete, circular HaPV genomes also were found in the cells of animals with UBD. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of HaPV particles in UBD lesions. These results, together with previous data, indicate that in the hamster, lymphomas contain complete, circular papovavirus genomes in the absence of virus particles, whereas epitheliomas and UBD lesions contain these genomes in the presence of virus particles.\r"

In addition, carcinogenic potencies of the compounds appeared to relate to their chemical reactivities as measured by hydrolysis rates. For a further study of this phenomenon, inhalation exposures were conducted with five additional water-reactive compounds: beta-propiolactone [(BPL) CAS: 57-57-8], methylmethane sulfonate [(MMS) CAS: 66-27-3], ethylchloroformate [(ECF) CAS: 541-41-3], dichloroacetyl chloride [(DCAC) CAS: 79-36-7], and propylene oxide [(PO) CAS: 75-56-9] on male Sprague-Dawley rats. The hydrolysis rates of these compounds span 6 orders of magnitude. The compounds were administered for 30 days (6 hr/day X 5 days/wk) with the use of exposure concentrations that were inversely proportional to the respective hydrolysis rates. With this protocol, all compounds except PO (the slowest reacting compound) produced nasal cancer in rats. The concentrations of MMS and BPL employed in the studies produced similar nasal cancer yields, indicating that the carcinogenic potencies of these compounds in rat nasal mucosa were proportional to their hydrolysis rates. The nasal cancer yields of DCAC and ECF were less than expected. DCAC hydrolyzes so rapidly at in vivo temperatures (half-life much less than 0.01 min) that it may not reach target DNA in reactive form. Why the exposures to ECF produced yields of nasal cancer not predicted by its reactivity is currently under investigation. These results combined with our earlier results demonstrate that the carcinogenic potencies of some inhaled reactive electrophilic compounds are related to their hydrolysis rates.\r"

  ".W": "An established in vitro cell line (LLTC), originally derived from the Lewis lung carcinoma (LL), was found to have lost sensitivity to the C-nucleoside antitumor agent tiazofurin (NSC-286193; 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) both in vitro and in vivo. A new in vitro cell line (LLAK) was derived from LL and compared to LLTC in its growth properties and sensitivity to tiazofurin. LLAK resembled the in vivo tumor in having both a high S-phase fraction and a high rate of cell death at high cell density. In continuous drug exposure growth inhibition assays, the concentration of tiazofurin required to reduce the number of cells in a culture by 50% with respect to control cultures was 0.51 microM for LLAK, 2.6 microM for LLTC, and greater than 10 microM for a range of human cancer cell lines. In cytotoxicity assays involving a 2-hour drug exposure followed by clonogenic assay, tiazofurin was more toxic to LLAK cells than to LLTC cells or L1210 murine leukemia cells, consistent with its high in vivo activity against LL. MM-96 human melanoma cells were highly resistant. Flow cytometry studies indicated that tiazofurin selectively depleted the LLAK cell population of S- and G2-phase cells. In one experiment involving 16 consecutive in vitro passages of LLAK in the absence of tiazofurin, a new line emerged that was resistant to tiazofurin in the clonogenic assay. The results demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of resistance from a tiazofurin-sensitive cell line. If similar processes occur during adaptation of human tumor cells to culture, this may explain the finding of low activity of tiazofurin toward a range of human tumor cell lines.\r"

Exposure was stopped and the fish were then transferred to clean, flowing seawater. Induced liver lesions were studied in periodic samples of fish taken during the next 140 weeks of holding. Lesions found following exposure were early altered basophilic and eosinophilic foci, oval cell hyperplasia, clear cell foci, neoplastic nodules, hepatocellular carcinomas, cholangiolar carcinomas, possible pericytomas originating in liver, hemangiopericytomas, spongiosis hepatis, and cholangiofibrosis. The relative prevalence of these lesions was given. Most of these lesions morphologically were compared to their counterpart lesions in the rat. Certain lesions in our fish such as hepatocellular carcinomas, cholangiolar carcinomas, pericytomas, hemangiopericytomas, spongiosis hepatis, and cholangiofibrosis have apparent similar cellular origins and morphogenesis to those lesions in rats and perhaps in other mammals. Spongiosis hepatis in the sheepshead minnow apparently arises from perisinusoidal cells and may be a neoplasm of this cell type. The general similarity of response to DENA in sheepshead minnows and rats suggests that this fish has promise as a model subject for studying some hepatocarcinogens and as a sentinel organism for detecting hepatocarcinogens in contaminated coastal waters.\r"

  ".W": "To avoid the exclusive use of rodent monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in patients for the detection of tumors by immunoscintigraphy and for radioimmunotherapy, swine MAbs were produced that are directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Spleen cells from 2 pigs immunized with purified colon carcinoma CEA were fused with a nonsecreting mouse myeloma cell line by conventional methods, except that a particularly long immunization protocol and large amounts of spleen and myeloma cells were used. Of 1,200 growing hybrids tested, 20 were found initially to produce antibodies binding to radiolabeled CEA. Seven stable clones producing anti-CEA MAbs for more than 6 months were derived from these hybrids by repeated subcloning. The pig origin of the seven MAbs was demonstrated in a solid-phase CEA enzyme immunoassay where anti-pig immunoglobin (Ig) antibodies coupled to peroxidase gave a positive reaction while anti-mouse Ig antibodies were entirely negative. All swine MAbs were of the IgG isotype. Three anti-CEA MAbs showed no cross-reactivity with granulocytes, while four others gave various degrees of reactivity with different granulocyte glycoproteins. Competitive binding to CEA performed for two purified swine MAbs showed that they recognized two different epitopes. The affinity constants measured for these two MAbs by Scatchard plot on purified CEA were high (1.2 X 10(9) and 1.2 X 10(10) liter/mol). One of the MAbs was tested in vivo for tumor localization by injection, after radiolabeling, in nude mice bearing human colon carcinoma xenograft. High ratios of tumor to normal tissue were obtained with mean values of 10.5 for intact MAbs and of 26.8 for F(ab')2 fragments of the porcine MAb. The results showed that heterofusion with this particular protocol can be used to produce swine MAbs of high affinity and specificity for a well-defined tumor marker. These reagents may have an important clinical utility, particularly in patients who became sensitized to mouse immunoglobulins.\r"

The RB (10-12 mo old) and YV (8 wk old) rats were fed the HF or low-fat (LF) diet (5% corn oil) prior to and following tumor implantation for a total of at least 10 weeks. The growth rate of the primary tumor in the intact RB and YV was not affected by the HF diet. In RB rats ovariectomized 4 weeks prior to tumor implantation, the tumor grew significantly faster in the HF group as compared to the LF group. The total volume of metastatic tumor nodules in the lungs of the HF groups was significantly higher than that in the the lungs of the LF groups in both the intact and ovariectomized RB. In the YV, there was no difference in pulmonary metastatic burden between the HF and LF groups. The weights of the HF intact and ovariectomized RBs were higher than those of the LF animals. However, when pulmonary metastatic tumor burden was compared to body weight at implant or at sacrifice, there was no significant correlation in either the HF or LF groups. These results suggest that an HF diet enhanced the growth of pulmonary metastases in the intact and ovariectomized RB but not the YV rats and that the effect of the HF diet on pulmonary tumor burden cannot be attributed entirely to increased body weight.\r"

The in vivo radiomodifying effects of ASC on a C3H/fSed murine fibrosarcoma (FSaII), on normal skin, and on bone marrow were determined with the use of the tumor growth delay and TCD50 (i.e., radiation dose required to control 50% of treated tumors for a minimum of 120 days) assays and the RD50 (i.e., dose required to cause a peak skin reaction of 2 in 50% of treated hind limbs) and LD50 (i.e., whole-body radiation lethal dose) assays, respectively. ASC was buffered to pH 7.35 and delivered ip at a dose of 4.5 mg g-1 body weight. ASC did not modify tumor growth delay induced by radiation or the TCD50 [87.1 Gy (control) vs. 85.6 Gy (ASC)]. Normal tissues, however, were radioprotected by ASC. RD50 values for 2+ acute skin reactions were 46.4 and 55.7 Gy for control and ASC-treated subjects, respectively; LD50 (30 days) values were 7.2 and 8.5 Gy. The enhancement ratios for skin and bone marrow were 1.20 and 1.18, and 95% confidence limits were (1.07 ... 1.34) and (1.14 ... 1.23), respectively. The therapeutic gain factor was 1.22 calculated as the ratio of the TCD50 and the reference normal tissue (RD50 or LD50). When ASC and MISO were combined, ASC reduced the in vivo radiosensitizing effects of MISO.\r"

  ".W": "A nonproducer clone (clone A1) (from a retrovirus-infected guinea pig fibrosarcoma) has been described that under conditions of in vivo immunologic selection forms variants that lack the proviral gene. One trivial explanation for the apparent loss of the provirus from clone A1 is that clone A1 did not originate from a single cell. For evaluation of this possibility, subclones were derived from clone A1 and tested for tumor recurrence in nonimmune and virus-immune animals. Each of four subclones contained the A1 provirus and exhibited specific viral interference; tumor recurrences formed from each of these four subclones lacked the clone A1 provirus. Possible, when heterogeneous populations of retrovirus-infected cells are injected into nonimmune animals, some clones will elicit immunologic responses to retroviral antigens and subject other clones in the population to immunologic selective pressures. For testing this concept, clone A1 was injected in admixture with a producer clone (clone A4) into nonimmune Sewall Wright strain 2 guinea pigs. Tumors formed in nonimmune guinea pigs inoculated with clone A1 in admixture with clone A4 were shown to lack a detectable clone A1 provirus. The results supported the concept that a somatic mutational event (deletion of the proviral gene) occurs during growth of clone A1. When heterogeneous populations of retrovirus-infected cells are injected into animals, host-clonal interactions may occur leading to outgrowth of proviral gene deletion variants. These results supported the notion that interactions between tumor clones and the host can change the dominant clonal type of the tumor and provide a genetic basis for this change.\r"

  ".W": "As the understanding of the magnitude and social impact of cancer has advanced, three major forces have shaped the current state of the art in cancer prevention and control: the maturation of organization approaches to solving the cancer problem; the accumulation of scientific evidence that justified and illuminated the concept of cancer as a controllable disease; and, most recently, the development of a systematic cancer control research process that provides efficiency and clearer direction to the planning of a national cancer control program. The National Cancer Institute, recognizing the need for goal setting and scientific accountability in the conduct of cancer control research, has established quantified mortality reduction objectives for the year 2000 related to smoking cessation, diet changes, early detection, and state-of-the-art treatment. The cancer control research process and these objectives will guide the allocation of cancer control resources toward the application of effective health promotion strategies.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the induction of immune-mediated glomerular injury influences the formation of cyclooxygenase products by glomerular cells, we determined prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) (as the stable metabolite of TXA2) formation in isolated glomeruli of rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN). PHN is a model of membranous nephropathy mediated by antibody and complement independent of inflammatory cells. Five days following induction of PHN by injection of heterologous antibody to rat proximal tubular brush border antigen (Fx1A) rats developed proteinuria 36.5 +/- 34 (controls 3.8 +/- 1 mg/day). Treatment with cobra venom factor, which depleted complement C3 levels to less than 10% of baseline, prevented the development of proteinuria (6.9 +/- 2 mg/day). The development of subepithelial, glomerular immune-complex deposits and proteinuria was associated with a significant stimulation of glomerular PGE2 (87%) and TXB2 (183%) formation. This increment in glomerular prostanoid biosynthesis was significantly inhibited (PGE2 increased 22%, TXB2 increased 75%) in animals that were complement depleted with cobra venom factor. Cobra venom factor had no effect on glomerular prostanoid formation in normal rats. In additional experiments we tested the hypothesis that TXA2 may contribute to mediation of proteinuria in PHN. We utilized a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor UK38485. UK38485 reduced glomerular TXB2 formation by 80% without influencing glomerular deposition of 125I-labeled antibody, and did not alter levels of urine protein excretion in rats with PHN (control 42 +/- 21, UK 38485, 39 +/- 24 mg/day, P greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conventional assays failed to detect viral antibodies in the saliva of 93 of 119 seropositive subjects. However, GACRIA detected the antibodies in both serum and saliva of all subjects seropositive by conventional tests, except 2 saliva specimens false-negative for anti-HBc and 1 false-negative for anti-rubella-virus. For anti-HIV and anti-HBc serum and saliva GACRIA reactivities did not differ significantly, but anti-HAV and anti-rubella-virus GACRIA reactivities were stronger in serum than saliva. GACRIA and GACELISA results on saliva for the four antibodies correlated closely; for anti-HAV and anti-HIV GACELISA and GACRIA were equally accurate. For both saliva and serum, GACRIA was superior to an IgA-capture assay in detecting anti-HAV and anti-HIV.\r"

Four hundred sixty subjects were positive for the antibody as determined by Western (immune) blot reactivity. The mean prevalence of HIV infection in this population of teenagers and young adults was thus 1.50 per 1000. According to multivariate analysis, the following demographic factors were found to be significant independent predictors of a positive HIV-antibody test: age (adjusted odds ratio = 1.10 per year), black race (adjusted odds ratio = 2.04), male sex (adjusted odds ratio = 1.84), residence in a densely populated county (adjusted odds ratio = 1.05 per 1000 per square mile), and residence in a metropolitan area with a high incidence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53). Antibody-positive applicants were identified in 43 of the 50 states. Counties with high prevalence rates for HIV (greater than 5 per 1000) were located in New York State (four counties), New Jersey (three counties), California (two counties), Maryland (two counties), and Texas, Colorado, and Washington, D.C.\r"

  ".W": "Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and are synthesized as precursors containing a presequence at the N terminus. In yeast and in mammalian cells, the function of the presequence in mitochondrial targeting has been revealed by chimaeric gene studies. Fusion of a mitochondrial presequence to a foreign protein coding sequence enables the protein to be imported into mitochondria in vitro as well as in vivo. Whether plant mitochondrial presequences function in the same way has been unknown. We have previously isolated and characterized a nuclear gene (atp2-1) from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia that encodes the beta-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. We have constructed a chimaeric gene comprising a putative atp2-1 presequence fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence and introduced it into the tobacco genome. We report here that a segment of 90 amino acids of the N terminus of the beta-subunit precursor is sufficient for the specific targeting of the CAT protein to mitochondria in transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate a high specificity for organelle targeting in plant cells.\r"

Some leukaemogenic events might produce a selective growth advantage by altering this regulatory network, possibly by diminishing the capacities of cells to adhere to stromal elements. Using an in vitro culture system which allows investigation of adhesion to stromal layers and subsequent colony formation by blast colony-forming cells (B1-CFC) in normal marrow and Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemic (CML) blood, we compared the adhesive properties of normal and malignant progenitor cells. We present evidence that altered adhesive interactions between primitive progenitor cells and marrow stromal cells occur in CML.\r"

The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences.\r"

These data allow us to reach the following conclusions: netropsin binding by deep penetration into the minor groove is overwhelmingly enthalpy driven and exhibits a very high binding affinity (K approximately 10(9) at 25 degrees C); deep penetration into the minor groove is required to form those drug-DNA interactions responsible for the enthalpy-driven high binding affinity of netropsin; I-C base pairs form binding sites for netropsin that thermodynamically are equivalent to those formed by A-T base pairs; the positive binding entropies reflect entropic contributions from molecular events other than just water spine disruption; the thermodynamic binding data primarily reflect local netropsin-DNA interactions rather than long-range binding-induced conformational changes at regions distant from the binding site; the enhanced binding affinity associated with deep penetration of netropsin into the minor groove does not result from more favorable electrostatic interactions; the binding of netropsin to the central AATT core of the decamer duplex [d(GCGAATTCGC)]2 is thermodynamically modeled best by netropsin binding to the poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)] duplex rather than the poly(dA).poly(dT) duplex.

  ".W": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL; triacylglycero-protein acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.34) was purified from bovine milk. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared, based on the amino acid sequences of three peptides obtained from partial digestion of purified LPL, and were used as probes to isolate cDNA clones for LPL mRNA from a bovine mammary gland. One of the clones, pLPL-49R2, contains an insert cDNA (49R2) of about 3.2 kilobases (kb) that hybridizes to all three probes and encodes a polypeptide that includes the NH2-terminal sequence of bovine LPL reported recently [Ben-Avram, C. M., Ben-Zeev, O., Lee, T. D., Hagga, K., Shively, J. E., Goers, J., Pedersen, M. E., Reeve, J. R. & Schotz, M. C. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 4185-4189]. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that cDNA insert 49R2 contains the entire coding region for LPL as well as a 3' untranslated region of about 1.6 kb. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that bovine LPL is a hydrophilic protein consisting of 450 amino acids (Mr 50,548) in its unglycosylated form. Blot hybridization analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA from bovine mammary gland demonstrated that there are at least three sizes of LPL mRNAs--3.2, 2.5, and 1.7 kb--with the 2.5-kb mRNA being the most abundant. Restriction endonuclease mapping of other cDNA clones suggested that the variation in mRNA size results from differential utilization of polyadenylylation signals during mRNA processing.\r"

Although a substitution of aspartate at position 113 with an asparagine residue did not affect expression or processing of the protein, the resulting mutant beta AR did not show detectable binding toward the antagonist iodocyanopindolol. Replacement of the aspartate and asparagine residues at positions 79 and 318, respectively, had no effect on the affinity of the receptor toward antagonists but reduced the affinity of the receptor toward agonists by 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, we observed that substitution of the proline at position 323 with a serine residue resulted in improper or incomplete processing of the beta AR, presumably reflecting a role for this residue in the folding of the receptor. Together with our previous results from deletion mutagenesis studies, these observations indicate that the ligand binding site involves the transmembrane region of the beta AR.\r"

In addition, there is the newly recognized problem of enantiomeric cross-inhibition, whereby template-directed polymerization involving one enantiomer of RNA is inhibited strongly by the presence of the other enantiomer. Here we propose that RNA was preceded in the evolution of life by a polymer constructed from flexible, acyclic, probably prochiral nucleotide analogues that were synthesized readily on the primitive earth. Several potentially prebiotic nucleotide analogues are considered in this context, and some of the consequences of this proposal are discussed.\r"

Recombinant plasmids containing human cDNA AHSG have been isolated by screening an adult human liver library with a mixed oligonucleotide probe. The cDNA clones containing AHSG inserts span approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs and include the entire AHSG coding sequence, demonstrating that the A and B chains are encoded by a single mRNA transcript. The cDNA sequence predicts an 18-amino-acid signal peptide, followed by the A-chain sequence of AHSG. A heretofore unseen connecting sequence of 40 amino acids was deduced between the A- and B-chain sequences. The connecting sequence demonstrates the unique amino acid doublets and collagen triplets found in the A and B chains; it is not homologous with other reported amino acid sequences. The connecting sequence may be cleaved in a posttranslational step by limited proteolysis before mature AHSG is released into the circulation or may vary in its presence because of alternative processing. The AHSG cDNA was utilized for mapping the AHSG gene to the 3q21----qter region of human chromosome 3. The availability of the AHSG cDNA clone will facilitate the analysis of its genetic control and gene expression during development and bone formation.\r"

  ".W": "The structural changes in four genetic variants of human serum albumin were analyzed by tandem high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the tryptic peptides, HPLC mapping and isoelectric focusing of the CNBr fragments, and amino acid sequence analysis of the purified peptides. Lysine-372 of normal (common) albumin A was changed to glutamic acid both in albumin Naskapi, a widespread polymorphic variant of North American Indians, and in albumin Mersin found in Eti Turks. The two variants also exhibited anomalous migration in NaDodSO4/PAGE, which is attributed to a conformational change. The identity of albumins Naskapi and Mersin may have originated through descent from a common mid-Asiatic founder of the two migrating ethnic groups, or it may represent identical but independent mutations of the albumin gene. In albumin Adana, from Eti Turks, the substitution site was not identified but was localized to the region from positions 447 through 548. The substitution of aspartic acid-550 by glycine was found in albumin Mexico-2 from four individuals of the Pima tribe. Although only single-point substitutions have been found in these and in certain other genetic variants of human albumin, five differences exist in the amino acid sequences inferred from cDNA sequences by workers in three other laboratories. However, our results on albumin A and on 14 different genetic variants accord with the amino acid sequence of albumin deduced from the genomic sequence. The apparent amino acid substitutions inferred from comparison of individual cDNA sequences probably reflect artifacts in cloning or in cDNA sequence analysis rather than polymorphism of the coding sections of the albumin gene.\r"

Polyclonal antibodies produced to two protein kinase C types were relatively type-specific, indicating that these proteins have unique antigenic determinants. We, therefore, characterized the enzymatic activities to determine if these proteins also had distinct biochemical properties. Type 1 protein kinase C was relatively less Ca2+-dependent than types 2 and 3. The addition of Ca2+ increased Vmax approximately 40% for type 1,600% for type 2, and 1400% for type 3 as compared to the Vmax measured at lower Ca2+ conditions. These results suggest that differences in primary structure can confer type-specific biochemical properties, and this in turn may provide the basis for protein kinase C type-specific stimulus-response coupling.\r"

To examine the mechanisms by which multiple chicken protein 4.1 variants are differentially expressed, we have isolated cDNA clones specific for chicken erythroid protein 4.1. We show that a single protein 4.1 gene gives rise to multiple 6.6-kilobase mRNAs by differential RNA processing. Furthermore, the ratios of protein 4.1 mRNAs change during chicken embryonic erythropoiesis. We observe a quantitative difference in variant ratios when protein 4.1 is synthesized in vivo or in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro.

  ".W": "The major cross-reacting peptide in human plasma detected with a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for thymosin alpha 1 was identified as prothymosin alpha, based on its elution properties in gel-filtration chromatography and its amino acid composition after purification by HPLC. A small quantity (less than 10%) of the total cross-reacting material was recovered in fractions corresponding to lower molecular weight thymosin alpha 1-like peptides. The total quantity of cross-reacting material detected in human blood, expressed as thymosin alpha 1 equivalents, was 11-14 pmol/ml (approximately 90% was recovered in the leukocyte fraction, approximately 10% was in the plasma fraction, and 1-2% was in the erythrocyte fraction). The peptide present in leukocytes was also identified as prothymosin alpha. After correction for the 5-times lower molar reactivity of prothymosin alpha in the thymosin alpha 1 RIA employed in these experiments, we estimate that the content of prothymosin alpha in human blood is 55-70 pmol/ml (0.6-0.8 microgram/ml). The relatively small quantities recovered in the erythrocyte and plasma fractions may be attributed to contamination of the former by leukocytes or to leakage from leukocytes into the plasma.\r"

By using a fluorescence microscope attached to a low-light-intensity charge-coupled-device camera and digital-image processor, the vesicles were easily viewed and initially showed uniform fluorescence intensity across the surface. The fluorescence pattern of vesicles made with a fluorophore attached to phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine was unaffected by the presence of divalent cations such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, or Cd2+. The fluorescence pattern of vesicles containing a fluorophore attached to the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylserine or phosphatidic acid showed distinct differences when treated with Ca2+ or Cd2+, although they were unaffected by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+. Treatment with 2.0 mM Ca2+ or Cd2+ resulted in the movement of the fluorophore to a single large patch on the surface of the vesicle. When vesicles were formed in the presence of 33 mol % cholesterol, patching was seen at a slightly lower Ca2+ concentration (1.0 mM). The possibility of interactions between Ca2+ and acidic phospholipids in plasma membranes was investigated by labeling erythrocytes and erythrocyte ghosts with fluorescent phosphatidic acid. When Ca2+ was added, multiple (five or six) small patches were seen per individual cell. The same pattern was observed when vesicles formed from whole lipid extracts of erythrocytes were labeled with fluorescent phosphatidic acid and then treated with Ca2+. This shows that the size and distribution of the Ca2+-induced domains depend on phospholipid composition.\r"

  ".W": "We synthesized a number of neoglycoprotein probes by covalently linking three biologically relevant sugars (mannose, galactose, and fucose) to a protein molecule so as to retain the pyranose (ring) form of sugars necessary for their interaction with lectins. In the presence of galactosyl and mannosyl but not fucosyl probes, the production of CFU-S [colony-forming unit(s) in spleen] and total cells was halted in murine long-term marrow cultures. Cobblestone areas disappeared in these cultures, indicating the inhibition of binding of hemopoietic cells to the stroma. Electron microscopy revealed no alterations of the stroma, and the probes did not have direct cytotoxic or inhibitory effects on the growth of CFU-S or CFU-C [colony-forming unit(s) in culture]. Stroma grown for 5 weeks in the presence of the probes could subsequently support the growth of hemopoietic progenitor cells when the probes were removed from the medium. Conversely, the proliferative capacity of CFU-S in the supernate, grown in the presence of the probes, was retained upon grafting to control stroma. Galactosyl and mannosyl but not fucosyl probes differentially agglutinated CFU-S in whole-marrow-cell suspensions, suggesting the presence of membrane lectins with specificity for these sugars on the surface of CFU-S. We conclude that the binding of CFU-S to marrow stroma (homing) is mediated by a recognition system with galactosyl and mannosyl specificities.\r"

To identify the molecular targets for these autoantibodies, we constructed a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library from human cerebellum and screened the library with IgG from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. A single clone, pCDR2, produced a fusion protein that reacted strongly with the patient's IgG. The isolated pCDR2 clone was used to identify six overlapping cDNA clones. Sequencing of the pCDR clones revealed a distinctive pattern consisting of a unit of 18 nucleotides (6 amino acids) repeated in tandem along the entire cDNA sequence. This sequence is unlike any previously described eukaryotic gene. Southern blot analysis was consistent with single-copy representation of the CDR (cerebellar degeneration-related) gene in the human and mouse genome. RNA blotting studies with normal tissues showed expression of the CDR gene to be largely restricted to brain. Expression of the CDR message was also noted in cell lines derived from cancers of neuroectodermal, kidney, and lung origin.\r"

ELISA typing results, based on two polymorphic DP antibodies DP11.1 and ILR1, were compared with PLT-defined and RFLP-defined types. Thus, using a range of probes and enzymes it is possible to identify DP polymorphism. The value of monoclonal antibodies for such studies is demonstrated, and the molecular data can, in some cases, pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies.\r"

Tenascin was detectable in the stroma of the malignant but not of the benign tumors from all species. An inhibition ELISA, testing homogenates of rat tumors, confirmed that tenascin was present in malignant but not in benign tumors. Thus, tenascin was consistently found to be a stromal marker for epithelial malignancy in the mammary gland. It is concluded that tenascin may be involved in the interactions between the epithelial and mesenchyme-derived (stromal) components of the mammary gland, which are known to influence epithelial carcinogenesis in this organ.\r"

Both of these recombinant adenoviruses replicated as efficiently as wild-type adenovirus in all human cells tested, including the human diploid cell strain WI-38. This indicates that insertion of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen gene into the E3 region does not significantly affect viral replication. Human cells infected with these recombinant adenoviruses secreted immunoreactive hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Since a practical small animal model for human adenoviruses was lacking, a hamster model was developed to evaluate the immunogenic potential of these recombinant adenoviruses. Upon intranasal inoculation, both wild-type adenovirus and the adenovirus E3-region deletion mutant replicated in the lungs of these animals and induced an antibody response against adenovirus. Hamsters similarly immunized with the live recombinant adenoviruses produced antibody against both adenovirus and hepatitis B virus surface antigen.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been recognized that human serum contains a protein that specifically binds human growth hormone (hGH). This protein has the same restricted specificity for hGH as the membrane-bound GH receptor. To determine whether the GH-binding protein is a derivative of, or otherwise related to, the GH receptor, we have examined the serum of three patients with Laron-type dwarfism, a condition in which GH refractoriness has been attributed to a defect in the GH receptor. The binding of 125I-labeled hGH incubated with serum has been measured after gel filtration of the serum through an Ultrogel AcA 44 minicolumn. Nonspecific binding was determined when 125I-hGH was incubated with serum in the presence of an excess of GH. Results are expressed as percent of specifically bound 125I-hGH and as specific binding relative to that of a reference serum after correction is made for endogenous GH. The mean +/- SEM of specific binding of sera from eight normal adults (26-46 years of age) was 21.6 +/- 0.45%, and the relative specific binding was 101.1 +/- 8.6%. Sera from 11 normal children had lower specific binding of 12.5 +/- 1.95% and relative specific binding of 56.6 +/- 9.1%. Sera from three children with Laron-type dwarfism lacked any demonstrable GH binding, whereas sera from 10 other children with other types of nonpituitary short stature had normal relative specific binding. We suggest that the serum GH-binding protein is a soluble derivative of the GH receptor. Measurement of the serum GH-binding protein may permit recognition of other abnormalities of the GH receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II (Ang-II) has profound effects on the brain. Receptors for Ang-II have been demonstrated on neurons, but no relationship between glial cells and Ang-II has been established. Glial cells (from the hypothalamus and brain stem of 1-day-old rat brains) in primary culture have been used to demonstrate the presence of specific Ang-II receptors. Binding of 125I-Ang-II to glial cultures was rapid, reversible, saturable, and specific for Ang-II. The rank order of potency of 125I-Ang-II binding was as follows: Ang-II = [sarcosine1,Ala8]Ang-II greater than [sarcosine1,Ile8]Ang-II much greater than Ang-III greater than Ang-I. Scatchard analysis revealed a homogeneous population of high-affinity (Kd = 1.1 nM) binding sites with a Bmax of 110 fmol/mg of protein. Light-microscopic autoradiography of 125I-Ang-II binding supported the kinetic data, documenting specific Ang-II receptors on the glial cells. Ang-II stimulated a dose-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols in glial cells, an effect mediated by Ang-II receptors. However, Ang-II failed to influence [3H]norepinephrine uptake, and catecholamines failed to regulate Ang-II receptors, effects that occur in neurons. These observations demonstrate the presence of specific Ang-II receptors on the glial cells in primary cultures derived from normotensive rat brain. The receptors are kinetically similar to, but functionally distinct from, the neuronal Ang-II receptors.\r"

The enzyme is highly processive, catalyzing the polymerization of thousands of nucleotides without dissociating. By virtue of the modification the 3' to 5' exonuclease activity is eliminated. The modified polymerase efficiently uses nucleotide analogs that increase the electrophoretic resolution of bands in gels. Consequently, dideoxynucleotide-terminated fragments have highly uniform radioactive intensity throughout the range of a few to thousands of nucleotides in length. There is virtually no background due to terminations at pause sites or secondary-structure impediments. Processive synthesis with dITP in place of dGTP eliminates band compressions, making possible the unambiguous determination of sequences from a single orientation.\r"

Tryptic digestion of the S-pyridylethylated protein followed by HPLC peptide mapping and automated sequence determination provided the bulk of the sequence information. Subsequent chymotryptic and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease cleavages yielded the sequences of several additional regions as well as extensive overlapping of the tryptic peptides. The primary structure shows six homologous regions of sequence based on the EF-hand concept of calcium binding, four of which are predicted to actually bind calcium. Aside from these regions, there is no overall structural identity or apparent similarity with the mammalian calbindins (9 kDa), calmodulin, or troponin C. It is predicted that the secondary structure of 28-kDa calbindin-D is significantly different from the other proteins of this class, which bind four calcium atoms.\r"

The purified RepA protein specifically initiated replication in vitro of plasmid DNA bearing the replication origin of R1 plasmid (oriR). The replication, strictly dependent on added RepA protein, was independent of host RNA polymerase but required other host replication functions (DnaB and DnaC proteins, the single-stranded-DNA-binding protein SSB, and DNA gyrase). The replication was also completely dependent on the host DnaA function. In filter binding assays in high salt (0.5 M KCl) conditions, RepA specifically binds to both supercoiled and linear plasmid DNA containing the oriR sequence, whereas it binds to nonspecific DNA in low salt. DNase I-protection studies on a linearized DNA fragment revealed that DnaA protein specifically binds to a 9-base-pair DnaA-recognition sequence (\"DnaA box\") within oriR only when RepA is bound to the sequence immediately downstream of the DnaA box. These results indicate that initiation of R1 plasmid replication is triggered by interaction of RepA and DnaA proteins with the oriR sequence.\r"

Specific factors that bind to discrete sequences within the enhancer DNA are found in extracts of embryonic and adult erythrocytes and in brain. These factors are specific for the tissue or the erythrocyte developmental stage and protect at least five discrete regions in or near the enhancer against DNase I digestion in \"footprinting\" experiments. Four of these regions reside wholly within the 136-base-pair functional enhancer domain, which also comprises a site in chromatin that is hypersensitive to nucleases. The nature of the binding sites and the program of appearance of the factors during development suggest that a subset of these interactions may be responsible for the developmental specificity of the enhancer.\r"

All amino acids were coupled to the peptide-resin in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; tert-butyloxycarbonyl-protected amino acids with the appropriate side-chain-protecting groups that are stable to the reaction conditions used in the solid-phase methodology were used. After cleavage and deprotection, the crude apoC-II was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and then by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified apolipoprotein was found to elute as a single peak under various chromatographic conditions, and the overall yield of the final purified protein was 20.7%. Synthetic apoC-II was characterized by several complementary analytical techniques including amino acid composition, Edman phenylisothiocyanate degradation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The final product was found to be homogeneous and to activate normal human post-heparin lipase to the same extent as native apoC-II. The synthetic protein is also equally immunoreactive as native apoC-II.\r"

  ".W": "We are investigating the feasibility of using the positive-strand RNA virus Sindbis virus and its defective interfering (DI) particles as vectors for introducing foreign genes into cells. In previous work we showed by deletion mapping of a cloned cDNA derived from one of the DI RNAs that only nucleotides at the 3' and 5' termini of the RNA are essential for the DI RNA to be amplified after it is transfected into cells in the presence of helper virus. As a first step in developing a vector we replaced 75% of the internal nucleotides of this DI cDNA with foreign sequences including the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; EC 2.3.1.28) gene. DI RNAs transcribed from this cDNA were replicated and packaged by helper Sindbis virus and became a major viral RNA species in infected cells by the third passage after transfection. They were also translated to produce enzymatically active CAT. CAT activity was measured at passage 3 but could also be detected in transfected cells. DI RNAs containing the CAT gene were translated in vivo and in vitro to produce two polypeptides immunoprecipitable by anti-CAT antibodies. One polypeptide was identical in size to the authentic CAT polypeptide; the other was the size expected for a protein initiated at an upstream, viral-specific AUG in frame with the CAT AUG. These studies establish that DI genomes of Sindbis virus can tolerate the insertion and direct the expression of at least one foreign gene.\r"

Hypersensitivity around the start site of transcription and approximately equal to 0.5 kilobases upstream correlates qualitatively with expression of these genes. Two hypersensitive sites, at -2.3 and -2.0 kilobases, map specifically to the Slp gene and correlate with its hormonal regulation. That is, these sites are more prominent in male liver chromatin and become more apparent in chromatin from females treated with testosterone. Further, these sites are established in males to a greater extent than in females prior to expression of Slp and may reflect gene-commitment events. Comparison of chromatin from mouse strains differing in C4 and Slp alleles indicates that the four regions of hypersensitivity may be necessary but are not sufficient for high levels of expression.\r"

  ".W": "The biologically active conformations of a series of four peptides [four cholecystokinin (CCK)-related peptides and enkephalin] in their interactions with gastrointestinal receptors have been deduced using conformational computational analysis. The two peptides that interact exclusively with peripheral-type CCK receptors are the heptapeptide COOH-terminal fragment from CCK (CCK-7) and the analogous sequence from cerulein (CER-7) in which threonine replaces the methionine proximal to the NH2 terminus. The two peptides that interact exclusively with the gastrin receptor in the stomach are the active COOH-terminal fragment of little gastrin and the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide sequence common to all of these peptides, CCK-4. We find that preferred conformations for the peripherally active peptides CCK-7 and CER-7 are principally beta-bends, whereas little gastrin and CCK-4 are fundamentally helical. In the class of lowest energy structures for both CCK-7 and CER-7, the aromatic rings of the tyrosine and phenylalanine lie close to one another whereas the tryptophan indole ring points in the opposite direction. This structure is superimposable on the structures of a set of rigid indolyl benzodiazepine derivatives that interact with complete specificity and high affinity with peripheral CCK receptors further suggesting that the computed beta-bends are the biologically active conformation. The biologically active conformation for CCK-4 and the little gastrin hexapeptide has also been deduced. By excluding conformations common to CCK-7 and CCK-4, which do not bond to each other's receptors, and then by selecting conformations in common to CCK-4 and the gastrin-related hexapeptide, which do bind to each other's receptors, we deduce that the biologically active conformation at the gastrin receptor is partly helical and one in which the indole of tryptophan and the aromatic ring of phenylalanine are close to one another while the methionine and aspartic acid side chains point in the opposite direction. These major differences in preferred structures between the common CCK-7/CER-7 peptides and the common CCK-4/little gastrin peptides explain the mutually exclusive activities of these two sets of peptides. We have observed that [Met]enkephalin strongly antagonizes the action of the naturally occurring peripherally active CCK-8 (CCK-7 with an NH2-terminal aspartic acid residue added). The computed lowest energy structures for this opiate peptide closely resemble key features of the computed CCK-7/CER-7 structure, further supporting the proposed structure.\r"

By analysis of digital micrographs from the Brookhaven scanning transmission electron microscope, we have identified a sample of 29 proteins (mass, 55 +/- 5 kDa) specifically bound at the palindrome. The individual protein digital images show extensive homology, which permits modeling a three-dimensional structure at a relatively low resolution, which is nonetheless significant for the study of protein-protein interactions in initiation. Non-sequence-specific competitor DNA at high mass excess can be used in reactions for microscopy, enabling characterization of specific binding for proteins present at 1% of total protein or less.\r"

Target size analysis indicated that the functional size of the [3H]phenamil binding sites associated with the epithelial Na+ channel from pig kidney is 92 +/- 10 kDa. The [3H]phenamil receptor was solubilized by using 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. The solubilized material displayed the same properties of interaction with amiloride and its derivatives as the membrane-bound receptor. A two-step purification of the epithelial Na+ channel was achieved by using QAE Sephadex chromatography and affinity chromatography on a Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin column. It results in an 1100-fold purification of the Na+ channel as compared to pig kidney microsomes with a yield of 15% +/- 5%. The maximal specific activity was 3.7 nmol/mg of protein. NaDodSO4/poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified Na+ channel under nonreducing conditions showed the presence of a single major polypeptide chain of apparent molecular mass 185 kDa. Under disulfide-reducing conditions, the purified epithelial Na+ channel migrated as a single band of apparent molecular mass 105 kDa. It is suggested that the epithelial Na+ channel from pig kidney has a total molecular mass of 185 kDa and consists of two nearly identical 90- to 105-kDa polypeptide chains crosslinked by disulfide bridges.\r"

The peptide also binds Co2+, and the absorption spectrum of the Co2+ complex suggests that a tetrahedral binding site is formed by two cysteines and two histidines. Experiments at higher temperatures (60-75 degrees C) suggest that these folded metal-peptide complexes are quite thermostable. The peptide shows some sequence-specific effects in DNase and methylation protection experiments. However, it does not give a clear \"footprint,\" and some effects are observed in the absence of added zinc.\r"

By using a partially purified monoterpene cyclase preparation and 2,3-cyclopropylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a substrate analog designed to uncouple the reaction sequence, the production of the corresponding tertiary homoallylic pyrophosphate isomer was demonstrated. This provides direct evidence for the usually cryptic isomerase component of the overall catalytic cycle. A number of other related products generated by reaction of cyclase with the analog were also identified, the structures and proportions of which were consistent with the intermediacy in catalysis of a cyclopropylcarbinyl cation X pyrophosphate anion pair. Kinetic parameters for the analog were compared with those of the natural substrate geranyl pyrophosphate. The results presented confirm mechanistic similarities in the enzymatic ionization and subsequent transformation of allylic pyrophosphate and cyclopropylcarbinyl pyrophosphate intermediates of isoprenoid metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The fidelity of DNA synthesis by calf thymus DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) in vitro has been determined using an M13lacZ alpha nonsense codon reversion assay. Pol delta is highly accurate, producing on average less than 1 single-base substitution error for each 10(6) nucleotides polymerized. This accuracy is 10- and 500-fold greater than that of DNA polymerases alpha and beta, respectively, in the same assay. Three observations suggest that this higher fidelity results in part from proofreading of misinserted bases by the 3' to 5' exonuclease associated with pol delta. First, the exonuclease efficiently excises terminally mismatched bases. Second, both terminal mismatch excision and the fidelity of DNA synthesis by pol delta are reduced with increasing concentration of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in the synthesis reaction. These effects result from increasing the rate of polymerization relative to the rate of exonucleolytic excision and are hallmarks of exonuclease proofreading. Third, both terminal mismatch excision and fidelity decrease upon addition to the reaction mixture of adenosine monophosphate, a compound known to selectively inhibit the exonuclease but not the polymerase activity of pol delta. These results suggest that 3' to 5' exonuclease-dependent proofreading enhances the fidelity of DNA synthesis by a mammalian DNA polymerase in vitro.\r"

A nonleukemogenic variant, Mo+PyF101 Mo-MuLV, did not induce the hyperplasia; this suggests that the hyperplasia is a necessary event in Mo-MuLV leukemogenesis. Another variant, MF-MuLV, which contains the long terminal repeat of Friend MuLV and causes erythroid leukemia instead of T-cell lymphoma, also induced the preleukemic hyperplasia. A model for Mo-MuLV leukemogenesis is presented in which two infection events are necessary: the first leads to generalized hematopoietic hyperplasia, and the second results in site-specific insertion and long terminal repeat activation of cellular protooncogenes.\r"

The entire 1724-base-pair cDNA has been sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein of 325 amino acids having a calculated molecular weight of 37,320. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the experimentally determined sequences of five different cyanogen bromide peptides. Transfection of COS-m6 cells with the cloned cDNA resulted in transient expression of a protein that could be detected by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody directed against the purified cardiac protein phosphatase. The expressed protein had the same apparent molecular weight as the purified enzyme when analyzed by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that this clone contains the entire coding region of the phosphatase mRNA. The cloned cDNA hybridizes to a mRNA of 2.0 kilobases in bovine heart and adrenal gland.

Nonstimulated control cells were extensively coupled to their neighbors throughout each acinus. Addition of heptanol caused their uncoupling and increased their basal amylase release. Neurotensin, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) stimulated amylase secretion without uncoupling acinar cells. Heptanol rapidly and markedly uncoupled the neurotensin-, secretin-, and VIP-stimulated acinar cells and increased their amylase secretion in an additive manner. By contrast, the secretory response to carbamoylcholine (carbachol), a secretagogue that, alone, uncoupled acinar cells, was not affected by heptanol. Basal as well as neurotensin-, secretin-, and VIP-stimulated output returned to the lower control values following removal of heptanol and recovery of normal coupling. The data provide evidence that blockage of gap junctional coupling increases the basal secretion of exocrine pancreas as well as the response of the gland to a variety of secretagogues.\r"

Extracellular cAMP signals regulate morphogenesis and induce chemotaxis and the activation and subsequent desensitization of adenylate and guanylate cyclase. cAMP signal transduction was investigated in Dd-ras-transformed cells. Transformants that overexpress the mutated Dd-ras-Thr12 gene show normal activation and desensitization of adenylate cyclase and normal activation of guanylate cyclase. However, cAMP induces a stronger desensitization of guanylate cyclase stimulation in the Dd-ras-Thr12 transformant than in transformants overexpressing the Dd-ras-Gly12 wild-type gene or in untransformed cells. This effect was correlated with a reduced chemotactic sensitivity of the transformant expressing the mutated Dd-ras-Thr12 gene.\r"

The results reported here corroborate and extend the results of earlier experiments with fluorescein-labeled, size-fractionated dextran: diffusion of nonbinding particles in cytoplasm is hindered in a size-dependent manner. Extrapolation of the data suggests that particles larger than 260 A in radius may be completely nondiffusible in the cytoplasmic space. In contrast, diffusion of Ficoll in protein solutions of concentration comparable to the range reported for cytoplasm is not hindered in a size-dependent manner. Although we cannot at present distinguish among several physical chemical models for the organization of cytoplasm, these results make it clear that cytoplasm possesses some sort of higher-order intermolecular interactions (structure) not found in simple aqueous protein solutions, even at high concentration. These results also suggest that, for native cytoplasmic particles whose smallest radial dimension approaches 260 A, size may be as important a determinant of cytoplasmic diffusibility as binding specificity. This would include most endosomes, polyribosomes, and the larger multienzyme complexes.\r"

  ".W": "Two human cDNA clones (HHO.c1.95 and HHO.c8.5111) containing a homeobox region have been characterized, and the respective genomic regions have been partially analyzed. Expression of the corresponding genes, termed c1 and c8, was evaluated in different organs and body parts during human embryonic/fetal development. HHO.c1.95 apparently encodes a 217-amino acid protein containing a class I homeodomain that shares 60 out of 61 amino acid residues with the Antennapedia homeodomain of Drosophila melanogaster. HHO.c8.5111 encodes a 153-amino acid protein containing a homeodomain identical to that of the frog AC1 gene. Clones HHO.c1 and HHO.c8 detect by blot-hydridization one and two specific polyadenylylated transcripts, respectively. These are differentially expressed in spinal cord, backbone rudiments, limb buds (or limbs), heart, and skin of human embryos and early fetuses in the 5- to 9-week postfertilization period, thus suggesting that the c1 and c8 genes play a key role in a variety of developmental processes. Together, the results of the embryonic/fetal expression of c1 and c8 and those of two previously analyzed genes (c10 and c13) indicate a coherent pattern of expression of these genes in early human ontogeny.\r"

These lines carry actively transposing copies of the transposons (Tn) Mu1 and Mu1.7. TnMu1 and TnMu1.7 are approximately 1400 and 1700 base pairs long, respectively, and they have 210-base-pair terminal inverted repeats. We report here extrachromosomal forms of TnMu1 and TnMu1.7. The extrachromosomal Mu1 and Mu1.7 molecules are resistant to alkaline denaturation and to proteinase treatment and have circular restriction maps; therefore, they are probably covalently closed circular DNA. Further, we show that their occurrence is correlated with Mu activity, so they are probably generated during Mu transposition as transposition intermediates or as products of Mu excision. When the total extrachromosomal supercoiled DNA from immature male flowers of a Mu line was examined by electron microscopy, the Mu transposons appeared to constitute a significant fraction of the extrachromosomal DNA circles in Mu lines.\r"

In a series of experiments, 62 plasmids were recovered that had two to six base substitutions in the 160-base-pair marker gene. Approximately 20-30% of the mutant plasmids that were recovered after passing ultraviolet-treated pZ189 through a repair-proficient human fibroblast line contained these multiple mutations. In contrast, passage of ultraviolet-treated pZ189 through an excision-repair-deficient (xeroderma pigmentosum) line yielded only 2% multiple base substitution mutants. Introducing a single-strand nick in otherwise unmodified pZ189 adjacent to the marker, followed by passage through the xeroderma pigmentosum cells, resulted in about 66% multiple base substitution mutants. The multiple mutations were found in a 160-base-pair region containing the marker gene but were rarely found in an adjacent 170-base-pair region. Passing ultraviolet-treated or nicked pZ189 through a repair-proficient human B-cell line also yielded multiple base substitution mutations in 20-33% of the mutant plasmids. An explanation for these multiple mutations is that they were generated by an error-prone polymerase while filling gaps. These mutations share many of the properties displayed by mutations in the immunoglobulin hypervariable regions.\r"

  ".W": "A pericentric inversion of a human X chromosome and a recombinant X chromosome [rec(X)] derived from crossing-over within the inversion was identified in a family. The rec(X) had a duplication of the segment Xq26.3----Xqter and a deletion of Xp22.3----Xpter and was interpreted to be Xqter----Xq26.3::Xp22.3----Xqter. To characterize the rec(X) chromosome, dosage blots were done on genomic DNA from carriers of this rearranged X chromosome using a number of X chromosome probes. Results showed that anonymous sequences from the distal end of the long arm to which probes 4D8, Hx120A, DX13, and St14 bind as well as the locus for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) were duplicated on the rec(X). Mouse-human cell hybrids were constructed that retained the rec(X) in the active or inactive state. Analyses of these hybrid clones for markers from the distal short arm of the X chromosome showed that the rec(X) retained the loci for steroid sulfatase (STS) and the cell surface antigen 12E7 (MIC2); but not the pseudoautosomal sequence 113D. These molecular studies confirm that the rec(X) is a duplication-deficiency chromosome as expected. In the inactive state in cell hybrids, STS and MIC2 (which usually escape X chromosome inactivation) were expressed from the rec(X), whereas G6PD was not. Therefore, in the rec(X) X chromosome inactivation has spread through STS and MIC2 leaving these loci unaffected and has inactivated G6PD in the absence of an inactivation center in the q26.3----qter region of the human X chromosome. The mechanism of spreading of inactivation appears to operate in a sequence-specific fashion. Alternatively, STS and MIC2 may have undergone inactivation initially but could not be maintained in an inactive state.\r"

  ".U": "87260908\r", 
  ".W": "In animal cells, exogenous DNA recombines into random chromosomal sites much more frequently than it recombines into homologous sites. Free DNA ends are \"recombinogenic\" in both processes. To test the effects of specific ends on analogous extrachromosomal processes, we constructed a linear genome of simian virus 40 with terminal repeated sequences. After transfection into monkey cells, the model substrate can circularize by end joining (analogous to random integration) or by homologous recombination between its terminal repeats (analogous to targeted recombination). Since the two types of recombination are in competition with one another, the ratio of homologous-recombination to end-join products is a sensitive indicator of the differential effects of specific ends. Substrates with blunt ends, complementary sticky ends, or mismatched ends generated the same ratio of homologous-recombination to end-join products. However, addition of dideoxynucleotides to the 3' hydroxyls of the substrate decreased the frequency of end joining by a factor of 5-6 relative to homologous recombination. Thus, the frequency of end joining can be decreased relative to that of homologous recombination by modification of the ends of the input DNA. These results suggest an approach to altering the ratio of random to targeted integration in mammalian cells.\r"

Two of these are recognized concurrently in greater than or equal to 90% of patient sera containing anticentromere autoantibodies (ACA), conclusively demonstrating that this autoimmune response is polyclonal. When present and previous data are combined, ACA are shown to recognize at least five independent epitopes on CENP-B. A radioimmunoassay based on cloned CENP-B has demonstrated that sera from greater than or equal to 96% of patients with ACA recognize the cloned antigen, thus defining a region of the protein that is recognized by virtually all patients with ACA. These findings have significant implications for models that seek to explain the origin of ACA and for the future detection of this group of autoantibodies in the clinical setting.\r"

A broad, group-specific cellular immune response to gp120 and to three different HIV isolates was seen in goats immunized with the native gp120 but not in animals immunized with the nonglycosylated recombinant envelope proteins. In HIV-infected people, no T-cell response was seen, even though their T-cell response toward other foreign antigens was intact. The results show type- and group-specific epitopes on gp120, some of which may be of importance for the development of a vaccine against HIV infection.\r"

  ".W": "Recent observations have suggested striking similarities between complement-mediated and cell-mediated lysis. Both pathways share the terminal insertion of channels into target membranes, and unique esterases have been postulated to participate in the activation of cytolytic effector molecules. Since killer-specific esterases and channel-forming proteins can be demonstrated in in vitro cell lines, it is important to ascertain that the described esterase and channel-forming proteins are also present in killer cells from in vivo sources. Results presented here show that killer-cell-specific N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester serine esterase is induced in vitro concomitant with the sensitization of cytotoxic effector cells. In contrast, in-vivo-primed cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells fail to express high levels of this enzyme. Assay of different cytotoxic effector cells reveals the presence of N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester serine esterase in clones with T killer and NK activity, but enzyme levels do not correlate with cytolytic activity nor does inhibition of esterase activity interfere with granule-mediated cell lysis. A similar result is seen with granule-mediated cytolytic activity. Cloned NK and T killer cell lines possess granules that are able to lyse erythrocyte targets. However, T killer cells sensitized in mixed lymphocyte culture or in vivo have no detectable cytotoxic granules. Cytotoxic granules are also not detected in NK cells isolated from animals.\r"

Antibodies were screened according to a scheme designed to select IgG immunoglobins that recognized a determinant specifically associated with the T-tubule membrane. Antibodies that fulfilled the screening criteria were used in in vitro planar bilayer recording of the activity of the dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channel present in T-tubules. Cells producing one antibody (Ab 21) survived cloning dilution and stably produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb21-4) that increased the rate of single channel opening when interacting with the internal side of the channel protein. mAb21-4 immobilized by covalent crosslinking on beads (Affi-Gel 10) consistently immunoprecipitated polypeptide bands with the following electrophoretic mobility: Mr values of greater than or equal to 175,000; 90,000; 55,000; and 34,000.\r"

Toward this end, we previously developed a collagen gel-supported culture system for growth of human tumors. This three-dimensional culture system is general and grows tumors at high frequency directly from surgery or biopsy that maintain important in vivo properties in vitro, including tissue architecture. We report here that with autoradiographic techniques measuring cellular DNA synthesis the drug responses of individual cells within the tissue structure of in vitro-grown tumors can be determined. Twenty tumor classes, including all the major ones, have been measured in toto at greater than 50% frequency. Quantitative and qualitative results show increasing cell kill with rising cytotoxic drug concentration, differential drug sensitivities of multiple cell types within individual cultured tumors, differential sensitivities of a series of tumors of the same histopathological classification to a single drug, differential sensitivities of individual tumors to a series of drugs, and sensitivity patterns of various tumor types similar to the sensitivities found in vivo. Therefore, the results indicate that potentially important therapeutic data can be obtained from tumor specimens growing in vitro for the individual cancer patient as well as for rational and relevant screening for new agents active against human solid tumors.\r"

Its co-storage and co-secretion with peptide hormones and neurotransmitters suggest that it has an important endocrine or secretory function. We have isolated cDNA clones from a bovine pituitary lambda gt11 expression library using an antiserum to parathyroid SP-I. The largest clone (SP4B) (approximately equal to 1.6 kilobases) hybridized to a transcript of 2.1 kilobases in RNA from parathyroid, pituitary, and adrenal medulla. Immunoblots of bacterial lysates derived from SP4B lysogens demonstrated specific antibody binding to an SP4B/beta-galactosidase fusion protein (160 kDa) with a cDNA-derived component of 46 kDa. Radioimmunoassay of the bacterial lysates with SP-I antiserum yielded parallel displacement curves of 125I-labeled SP-I by the SP4B lysate and authentic SP-I. SP4B contains a cDNA of 1614 nucleotides that encodes a 449-amino acid protein (calculated mass, 50 kDa). The nucleotide sequences of the pituitary SP-I cDNA and adrenal medullary SP-I cDNAs are nearly identical. Analysis of genomic DNA suggests that pituitary, adrenal, and parathyroid SP-I are products of the same gene.\r"

Rabbit antipeptide antibodies bound specifically to the C1+ synthetic peptide and to an eel membrane fraction bearing a high density of Na channels. When applied to the external surface of cultured dorsal root ganglion cells obtained from newborn rats, the antibodies modify Na channel inactivation by shifting the steady-state Na current-inactivation parameter, h infinity, curve to more negative potentials in fast and slow Na currents. The rate of inactivation of the slow channel is shown to be increased. The antibodies do not have a significant effect on activation of the channels. Part of the amino acid sequence corresponding to C1+ peptide is therefore accessible, in the mammalian Na channel, from the external membrane surface and is associated with the inactivation gate.\r"

Patch-clamp recordings from cell-attached patches showed that serotonin, applied locally outside the patch, caused the opening of channels of approximately equal to 3 pS conductance and an average lifetime of approximately equal to 100 msec. The extrapolated reversal potential indicated that the channels are chloride-selective. Single-channel currents with similar characteristics were observed in inside-out patches from native oocytes in response to elevated calcium concentrations on the cytoplasmic side. Measurements of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by fura-2 fluorescence showed approximately equal to 10-fold increases in [Ca2+]i in response to serotonin application in both normal and calcium-free Ringer solution in mRNA-injected oocytes. Little or no response to serotonin was observed in native oocytes. These results suggest that serotonin activation of receptors that are inserted into the oocyte membrane following injection of rat brain poly(A)+ mRNA can induce calcium release from intracellular stores. The increase in [Ca2+]i subsequently activates calcium-dependent chloride channels. Because calcium-dependent chloride channels and a receptor-controlled mechanism of internal calcium release have been shown to exist in native oocytes, we conclude that the newly inserted serotonin receptors utilized the endogenous second-messenger-mediated calcium release to activate endogenous calcium-dependent chloride channels.\r"

In RNA gel blot experiments, a single band (1.1 kilobases long) was observed in all cases in which an RNA was detected. A low level of PPT mRNA was detected by RNase protection assay in uncultured ganglia, suggesting that the low levels of SP previously observed in the normal ganglion in vivo are synthesized locally. When ganglia were maintained in culture, with consequent denervation, the steady-state level of PPT mRNA increased by 25-fold over the first 24 hr, and the high level was maintained for at least 7 days. RNase protection experiments indicated that the major message in the SCG is the beta-PPT mRNA, encoding both SP and neurokinin A peptide regions. Accumulation of the PPT mRNA in cultured ganglia was sharply inhibited by the depolarizing agent veratridine, and this effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin. Therefore, one form of neuronal plasticity, change in neurotransmitter metabolism, is regulated at least in part by altering steady-state levels of specific mRNA. More generally, extracellular signals may contribute to neuronal plasticity through changes in gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibin, a gonadal hormone capable of preferential suppression of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, has recently been purified. The major form of this protein is an alpha beta heterodimer encoded by two separate genes. In contrast to the FSH-suppressing action of the alpha beta heterodimer, the beta beta homodimer stimulates FSH secretion. Luteinizing hormone (LH)-secreting pituitary cells and gonadal androgen-producing cells have long been shown to form a closed-loop feedback axis. Based on recent studies demonstrating the FSH stimulation of inhibin biosynthesis by ovarian granulosa and testis Sertoli cells, an additional closed-loop feedback axis exists between pituitary FSH- and gonadal inhibin-producing cells. Because uncharacterized Sertoli cell factors have been suggested to either stimulate or inhibit androgen production by testicular Leydig cells, we have tested the intragonadal paracrine actions of heterodimers and homodimers of inhibin subunits. In primary cultures of testis cells, the alpha beta heterodimer of inhibin enhances Leydig cell androgen biosynthesis stimulated by LH, whereas the beta beta homodimer suppresses androgen production. Furthermore, similar modulatory actions of inhibin-related proteins were found in cultured ovarian theca-interstitial cells and theca explants treated with LH. In contrast, treatment with the inhibin-related proteins alone did not affect gonadal steroidogenesis. Our data indicate that the inhibin-related gene products synthesized by Sertoli and granulosa cells may form heterodimers or homodimers to serve as intragonadal paracrine signals in the modulation of LH-stimulated androgen biosynthesis and allow cross-communication between the two feedback loops.\r"

The peptide backbone makes a continuous spiral that begins as a 3(10)-helix at the N-terminus, changes to an alpha-helix for two turns, and ends in a spiral of three beta-bends in a ribbon. Each of the beta-bends contains a proline residue at one of the corners. The torsion angles phi i range from -51 degrees to -91 degrees (average value -64 degrees), and the torsion angles psi i range from -1 degree to -46 degrees (average value -31 degrees). There are 10 intramolecular NH...OC hydrogen bonds in the helix and two direct head-to-tail hydrogen bonds between successive molecules. Two H2O and two CH3OH solvent molecules fill additional space with appropriate hydrogen bonding in the head-to-tail region, and two additional H2O molecules form hydrogen bonds with carbonyl oxygens near the curve in the helix at Pro-10. Since there is only one peptide molecule per cell in space group P1, the molecules repeat only by translation, and consequently the helices pack parallel to each other.\r"

A resolved peak of TMDA has been obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography of the final extracts derivatized with phenylisothiocyanate. Selected ion monitoring with multiple-ion detection applied to the compounds separated by gas chromatography revealed the presence of the respective molecular ions and of the decarboxylated fragments, thus confirming the identification of cyclothionine and TMDA in human urine.\r"

The factors involved in the loss of therapeutic efficacy with administration of large pharmacological doses of the hormone require special consideration. Down-regulation of the hormone receptors could account for the escape phenomenon. Specific binding sites for salmon calcitonin (sCT) were characterized and localized by autoradiography on rat kidney sections incubated with 125I-labeled sCT. Autoradiograms demonstrated a heterogenous distribution of 125I-labeled sCT binding sites in the kidney, with high densities in both the superficial layer of the cortex and the outer medulla. Infusion of different doses of unlabeled sCT by means of Alzet minipumps for 7 days produced rapid changes in plasma calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels, which were no longer observed after 2 or 6 days of treatment. Besides, infusion of high doses of sCT induced down-regulation of renal sCT binding sites located mainly in the medulla, where calcitonin (CT) has been shown to exert its physiological effects on water and ion reabsorption. These data suggest that the resistance to high doses of sCT often observed during long-term treatment of patients may be the consequence of not only bone-cell desensitization but also down-regulation of CT-sensitive kidney receptor sites.\r"

This oligonucleotide binds to complementary sequences containing beta-nucleosides. Binding to ribose-containing oligomers and polymers is much stronger than binding to deoxyribose-containing analogs. A derivative of acridine (9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine) was covalently attached either to the 5' phosphate or to the 3' phosphate of the alpha-octathymidylate. A pentamethylene linker was used to bridge the phosphate group and the 9-amino group of the acridine derivative. In both cases the complexes with the complementary sequences were strongly stabilized due to the additional binding energy provided by intercalation of the acridine ring within the miniduplex structure formed by the oligonucleotide with its target sequence. The acridine-substituted alpha-oligothymidylates did not lose their discrimination between ribose and deoxyribose-containing complementary sequences. The alpha-oligothymidylates were much more resistant towards endonucleases than their beta analogs, independently of whether they were linked to the acridine derivative. Acridine substitution provided additional protection against the corresponding exonucleases. alpha-Oligodeoxynucleotides covalently linked or not to intercalating agents represent families of molecules that open possibilities to block mRNA translation or viral RNA expression in vitro and in vivo.\r"

After injection into athymic nude mice by four different routes, primary tumors and secondary lung metastases were isolated, adapted to in vitro growth, and analyzed for DNA levels and mRNA expression of both genes for comparison with the originally injected transformed cells and untransformed 3T3 cells. For all tumors (primary or secondary), the v-Ki-ras gene was amplified and v-Ki-ras mRNA expression was highly elevated above that observed in the original transformed cell population. In two of five lung metastases from the i.v. and footpad injection routes, rearranged Ki-ras DNA sequences were observed. Micrometastases from the s.c. route of injection did not display these alterations. Injection of footpad lung tumor cells with rearrangements into a second group of animals led to multiple lung metastases with even further rearrangements correlating with more effective lung colonization/growth ability (overt lung tumors in five of eight animals less than 20 days after injection). However, reinjection of an i.v. lung tumor with rearranged Ki-ras led to no further rearrangements in the lung microfoci tumors isolated greater than 40 days after injection. These data suggest (i) the significance of amplification and elevated expression of v-Ki-ras in tumor formation, (ii) correlation of this amplification with more effective tumor progression, and (iii) the selective advantage that cells with Ki-ras DNA sequence additions have in the formation of overt lung tumors.\r"

Furthermore, the in vivo and in vitro transported mRNP showed a similar degree of resistance to RNase digestion and had sedimentation coefficients approximately 2.5 times that of the isolated mRNA. Release of both total mRNA and alpha 2 mu-globulin mRNA was proportional to the concentration of a specific cytoplasmic protein. Removal of the transport proteins from the cytosol with streptomycin sulfate provided a basal system incapable of supporting the active transport of alpha 2 mu-globulin mRNA. Hybridization of released RNA with a recombinant probe specific for intron 6 of alpha 2 mu-globulin showed that intron sequences were retained within the nucleus under optimal alpha 2 mu-globulin mRNA transport conditions and that the transported alpha 2 mu-globulin mRNA was of mature size.\r"

When a precursor mRNA was capped, the upstream intron was spliced out more efficiently than the downstream intron. The differential splicing reactions of the two introns are not due to differences in the intrinsic efficiency of splicing of each intron, since the preferential excision of the upstream intron was also observed when the positions of the two introns relative to the cap structure were reversed. When uncapped precursor mRNA was used as substrate, the downstream intron was spliced out appreciably, but splicing of the upstream intron was greatly reduced. Preincubation of the extract with cap analogues inhibited splicing of the upstream intron but not the downstream intron. Thus, the cap structure exerts its effect primarily on the 5' proximal intron.\r"

Whole cell extracts have been prepared from cultured GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells to study lactotroph-specific expression of the rat PRL (rPRL) gene in an in vitro transcription assay. The human alpha 1-globin and Rous sarcoma virus promoters efficiently initiate transcription in both HeLa and GH3 cell extracts, whereas the rPRL promoter containing 425 base pairs of 5' flanking DNA is active only in GH3 pituitary cell-free extracts. Transcription of the rPRL gene was reconstituted in HeLa cell extracts by the addition of GH3 cell extracts. DNase I digestion of the rPRL promoter reveals two protected regions centered at positions -55 (I) and -160 (III) that are GH3 cell-specific and rPRL promoter-selective. These \"footprints\" overlie a highly conserved 8-base-pair motif, CCTGATAATA. By contrast, footprint II at position -125 is common to both HeLa and GH3 cell extracts and overlies a 15-base-pair sequence found in all members of the growth hormone gene family. Thus, GH3 pituitary cell-free extracts selectively transcribe the rPRL gene and contain cell-specific factors that directly interact with the rPRL promoter. These studies provide useful assays to further identify, purify, and characterize pituitary-specific transcription factors and to address the biochemical mechanisms involved in rPRL gene expression.\r"

These spectra exhibit less than 10(-4) absorbance unit of noise, even utilizing wet samples containing approximately 10 pmol of bR in the measuring beam. The bR----M transient difference spectrum is similar to FT-IR difference spectra previously obtained under conditions where M decay was blocked (low temperature or low humidity). In particular, the transient spectrum exhibits a set of vibrational difference bands that were previously attributed to protonation changes of several tyrosine residues on the basis of isotopic derivative spectra of M at low temperature. Our rapid-sweep FT-IR spectra demonstrate that these tyrosine/tyrosinate bands are also present under more physiological conditions. Despite the overall similarity to the low-temperature and low-humidity spectra, the room-temperature bR----M transient difference spectrum shows significant additional features in the amide I and amide II regions. These features' presence suggests that a small alteration of the protein backbone accompanies M formation under physiological conditions and that this conformational change is inhibited in the absence of liquid water.\r"

This procedure yields a major protein with an apparent Mr of 70,000 on NaDodSO4/PAGE in the presence of reducing agent and Mr 140,000 (Mr 140,000-160,000) on gel filtration and polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, indicating that the active protein is a dimer. This protein has an acidic pI of 4.2 under nondenaturing conditions, which rises to 5.6 under denaturing conditions. The isolation of the same Mr 70,000 protein with three different, but structurally related, agents as affinity ligands and the immunological identity of the isolated proteins constitute strong evidence that this protein is the PPbP capable of recognizing PP that are structurally related to clofibrate. The PPbP probably plays an important role in the regulation of PP-induced pleiotropic response.\r"

  ".W": "A procedure for the isolation of transcriptionally active nucleosomes was used to monitor changes in chromatin structure during the activation, repression, and superinduction of the protooncogenes c-fos and c-myc. Nuclei were isolated from murine fibroblasts at successive times after stimulation of quiescent cell cultures with serum or platelet-derived growth factor. The nucleosomes released by a brief micrococcal nuclease digestion were fractionated by HgII-affinity chromatography to separate the unfolded nucleosomes of transcriptionally active genes (in which the sulfhydryl groups of histone H3 are accessible for binding to HgII) from the compactly beaded nucleosomes of transcriptionally inert DNA sequences (in which the H3 sulfhydryl groups are not accessible). The DNA sequence contents of the HgII-bound and unbound nucleosome fractions were compared by slot-blot hybridizations to 32P-labeled cloned probes for c-fos and c-myc. The binding of the c-fos and c-myc nucleosomes to the HgII column accurately reflected both the timing and the degree of their expression, as determined by run-off transcription assays with the isolated nuclei. The superinduction of c-fos and c-myc expression by an inhibitor of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) was reflected in the persistence of the unfolded, transcriptionally active state of their component nucleosomes. These results provide direct evidence that rapid and reversible changes in nucleosome topography accompany the program of oncogene expression, and they suggest a way to monitor aberrant gene activity during malignant transformation.\r"

The amplitude of the oscillations can represent greater than 50% of the maximum turbidity change and oscillations persist for up to 20 periods of 80 s each. Oscillations are accompanied by extensive length redistribution of microtubules. Preliminary work suggests that the oscillatory kinetics can be simulated using a model in which many microtubules undergo synchronous transitions between growing and rapidly depolymerizing phases, complicated by the kinetically limiting rate of nucleotide exchange on free tubulin.\r"

Antibodies directed against cofilin labeled intranuclear actin rods induced in cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or exposed to heat shock and also labeled cytoplasmic actin rods induced in cells incubated in specific salt buffers. Moreover, we found that these actin rods are not stained with fluorescent phalloidin derivatives at all and appear to be right-handed helices, different from straight bundles of F-actin such as stress fibers. In vitro experiments revealed that cofilin and phalloidin compete with each other for binding to F-actin. Since cofilin and phalloidin have the ability to stoichiometrically bind actin molecule in the filament in vitro, the above results seem to suggest that cofilin directly binds to actin molecule in nearly an equimolar ratio in these rods. We call these rods \"actin/cofilin rods.\"\r"

Bovine aortic and brain capillary endothelial and smooth muscle cells are similarly affected. TNF-alpha is a noncompetitive antagonist of FGF-stimulated cell proliferation. Its action on endothelial cells is reversible and noncytotoxic. Surprisingly, TNF-alpha does not seem to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vivo. In the rabbit cornea, even a high dose of TNF-alpha (10 micrograms) does not suppress angiogenesis induced by basic FGF. On the contrary, in this model system TNF-alpha stimulates neovascularization. The inflammatory response that is seen in the cornea after TNF-alpha implantation suggests that the angiogenic properties of this agent may be a consequence of leukocyte infiltration.\r"

In this study we provide evidence that protein kinase C has a role in inducer-mediated MEL cell differentiation: (i) HMBA induces the formation of a soluble, proteolytically activated form of protein kinase C that is catalytically active in the absence of Ca2+ and phospholipid; (ii) the protease inhibitor leupeptin blocks formation of this activated form of the kinase and inhibits HMBA-induced MEL cell hemoglobin accumulation; (iii) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibits HMBA-induced MEL differentiation and causes depletion of total protein kinase C activity; (iv) MEL cells depleted in protein kinase C activity by culture with PMA are resistant to induction by HMBA; (v) upon removal of PMA, restoration of MEL cell sensitivity to HMBA is correlated with reaccumulation of protein kinase C activity; and (vi) MEL cells grown to density arrest are both depleted of protein kinase C activity and resistant to HMBA. Together, these results suggest that HMBA-mediated MEL cell differentiation involves a protein kinase C-related mechanism and the proteolytically activated form of the kinase, which does not require Ca2+ or phospholipid for its catalytic activity.\r"

Human platelet-derived transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-beta) specifically stimulated synthesis of at least two types of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in nonproliferating human adult arterial smooth muscle cells in culture. Stimulation of smooth muscle cell proteoglycan synthesis by smooth muscle cell growth promoters (epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and heparin-binding growth factors) was less than 20% of that elicited by TGF-beta. TGF-beta neither significantly stimulated proliferation of quiescent smooth muscle cells nor inhibited proliferating cells. The extent of TGF-beta stimulation of smooth muscle cell proteoglycan synthesis was similar in both nonproliferating and growth-stimulated cells. TGF-beta, which is a reversible inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation, had no comparable effect on endothelial cell proteoglycan synthesis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TGF-beta is a cell-type-specific regulator of proteoglycan synthesis in human blood vessels and may contribute to the myo-intimal accumulation of proteoglycan in atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

Continued growth of the eye (which lasts until well beyond metamorphosis) is by the continued proliferation of cells in this germinal zone. To determine what factor(s) promotes cell division in this region of the eye long after it ceases at the back of the eye (near the optic nerve), we have transplanted small groups of eye cells from pigmented donor embryos into the eyes of albino hosts, transposing cells from the mitotically quiescent back of the eye to the germinal zone and vice versa. Regardless of their position of origin in the donor eye, only implants into the host germinal zone behaved like germinal cells--as assayed in the living growing eye by the addition of black tissue to the pigment retinal epithelium. Conversely when donor germinal cells were implanted into the back of the host eye, they ceased dividing once they became integrated into the eye and remained as a tiny black spot on the back of the host eye. This suggests that local environmental cues, rather than intrinsic cellular determinants, specify the fates of eye cells ensuring that cells on the eye rim will continue to function as germinal cells while others will withdraw from the cell cycle.\r"

This developmentally regulated pattern of c-mos expression in oocytes and spermatogenic cells suggests that the c-mos gene product may have a function in normal germ-cell differentiation or early embryogenesis.\r"

From the deduced amino acid sequence, human LDHC4 is as different from rodent LDHC4 (73% homology) as it is from human LDHA4 (76% homology) and porcine LDHB4 (68% homology). Subunit homologies are consistent with the conclusion that the LDHC gene arose by at least two independent duplication events. Furthermore, the lower degree of homology between mouse and human LDHC4 and the appearance of this isozyme late in evolution suggests a higher rate of mutation in the mammalian LDHC genes than in the LDHA and -B genes. Comparison of exposed amino acid residues of discrete antigenic determinants of mouse and human LDHC4 reveals significant differences. Knowledge of the human LDHC4 sequence will help design human-specific peptides useful in the development of a contraceptive vaccine.\r"

The alpha A-crystallin gene appears to have all the necessary transcriptional and translational signal sequences to be expressed in the rudimentary lens of the mole rat and gives rise to probably two protein products by means of alternative splicing, as in rodents with normal vision. Comparisons of the blind mole rat alpha A-crystallin sequence with alpha A sequences from other rodents reveal a considerable acceleration of the substitution rate at nonsynonymous positions in the mole rate lineage, which reflects a relaxation of selective constraints, but the acceleration is not to the extent that might be expected if the gene were now without any function. The remaining evolutionary constraints still imposed upon the mole rat alpha A-crystallin gene may possibly reflect the need for alpha-crystallin expression as an indispensable component in the developmental program of the atrophied eye.\r"

These hybrids have been extensively characterized by using the allozymes hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (encoded by the Hprt locus) and alpha-galactosidase (Ags) and a series of 11 X-chromosome-specific DNA probes whose localization had been previously established by linkage studies. Such studies have established the genetic breakpoints of the T(X;12)13Rl and T(X;2)14Rl X-autosome translocations on the X chromosome and provided additional information as to the X-chromosome genetic breakpoints of the T(X;16)16H, T(X;4)7Rl, and T(X;7)6Rl translocations. The data establish clearly that both the T(X;4)7Rl and T(X;12)13Rl X-chromosome breakpoints are proximal to Hprt, the breakpoint of the former being more centromeric, lying as it does in the 9-centimorgan interval between the ornithine transcarbamoylase (Otc) and DXPas7 (M2C) loci. Similarly, it is now clear that the T(X;16)16H X-autosome translocation breakpoint lies distal to the DXPas8 (St14-1) locus, narrowing the X-chromosome breakpoint down to a region flanked proximally by this marker and representing, as expected from previous data, the distal quarter of the Hprt-Ta subchromosomal span. These five hybrid cell lines provide, with the previously characterized EBS4 hybrid cell line, a nested series of seven mapping intervals distributed along the length of the mouse X chromosome. Their characterization not only allows further correlation of the genetic and cytological X-chromosome maps but also should permit the rapid identification of DNA probes specific for particular regions of the mouse X chromosome.\r"

We report the use of retroviral vectors for transfer of recombinant genes into primary mouse hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were grown in a defined serum-free medium and expressed liver-specific functions for up to 14 days. Hepatocytes were transformed to Genticin (G418) resistance by infection with recombinant retroviruses carrying the Tn5 neomycin-resistance gene. The G418-resistant cells exhibited characteristic hepatocyte morphology and continued to express liver-specific gene function. A retrovirus that expresses neomycin resistance driven by a herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter produced the most efficient transformation compared with viruses using the retroviral long terminal repeat promoter or the simian virus 40 early-region promoter. These experiments indicate that primary hepatocytes can be successfully cultured and transformed with recombinant genes using retroviral vectors. These results provide a model for future somatic gene replacement therapy in which functional genes can be introduced into hepatocytes by viral-mediated gene transfer.\r"

Since the molecular structure of AcChoR is well known, myasthenia gravis is an excellent system for studying the recognition of a complex membrane antigen in the human immune system. Human T-helper (TH) cell lines reactive to the AcChoR were isolated from four myasthenic patients by selection with native AcChoR from Torpedo californica. The selected TH cells could efficiently recognize native and fully denatured AcChoR. The vast majority of the TH-stimulating AcChoR epitopes were located on the denatured alpha subunit of AcChoR. Antibody competition experiments using a panel of rat anti-AcChoR monoclonal antibodies showed that 39-45% of the autoantibodies present in the sera of these same patients bound to the conformation-sensitive \"main immunogenic region\" (MIR), also located on the alpha subunit. However, AcChoR-induced stimulation of the T cells could not be inhibited with up to 20-fold molar excess of different rat anti-MIR monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that the Torpedo AcChoR alpha subunit contains conformation-insensitive epitopes that play a role in the autosensitization of TH cells and that seem to be physically separated from the MIR. The specificity of the TH cell response may contribute to directing the B-cell response to other alpha-subunit determinants, such as the MIR itself.\r"

After a 2-day or longer treatment, 2- to 5-fold increases were found in the percentages of cells exhibiting reactivity with either the murine OKM1 monoclonal antibody or the Leu-M5 monoclonal antibody, staining positively for nonspecific esterase activity, and displaying a promonocyte morphology. The increases in these differentiation markers after treatment with 0.03-1 microM THC were dose dependent. At this dose range, THC did not cause an inhibition of cell growth. The THC-induced cell maturation was also characterized by specific changes in the patterns of newly synthesized proteins. Pronounced among these changes was an increase in the synthesis of at least 10 proteins that are found abundantly in monocytes. The THC-induced differentiation did not, however, result in cells with a highly developed mature monocyte phenotype; the THC-treated cells failed to exhibit other monocyte markers such as attachment to the surface of tissue culture dishes or morphological maturation beyond the promonocyte stage. However, treatment of these \"incompletely\" matured cells with either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, which are inducers of differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells (including ML-2 cells), produced cells with a mature monocyte morphology. Two other cannabinoids, cannabidiol and cannabinol, which were more cytotoxic than THC at comparable doses, also caused an increase in the expression of maturation markers, but at doses higher than those required for THC. The ML-2 cell system described here may be a useful tool for deciphering critical biochemical events that lead to the cannabinoid-induced \"incomplete\" cell differentiation of ML-2 cells and other related cell types. Findings obtained from this system may have important implications for studies of cannabinoid effects on normal human bone-marrow progenitor cells.\r"

Ten hypertriglyceridemic patients (type IV phenotype) with familial combined hyperlipidemia and 7 patients with monogenic familial hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG) were compared with 18 healthy controls; all subjects were males. Pool size, synthesis rate, and fractional catabolic rate of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids were determined with an isotope dilution technique. Patients with FHTG had synthesis rates of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and total bile acids above those seen in normal controls (P less than 0.001); also the fractional catabolic rates of both bile acids were increased (P less than 0.001). In contrast, bile acid kinetic parameters were--with one exception--within normal limits in patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia. The abnormality of bile acid metabolism could also be identified in a normolipidemic individual presumed to carry the gene for FHTG. The postprandial rise of serum bile acids was blunted in FHTG, indicating that the intestinal uptake of bile acids may be deficient in this condition. We conclude that FHTG, but not familial combined hyperlipidemia, is frequently associated with a defective regulation of bile acid synthesis, resulting in abnormally high production rate of bile acids. It is hypothesized that this abnormality is important for the subsequent development of hypertriglyceridemia.\r"

Here we report that doubly positively charged dequalinium, which has been used for 30 years as an antimicrobial agent in over-the-counter mouthwashes, lozenges, ointments, and paints, exhibits significant anticarcinoma activity. Dequalinium is more effective than seven of eight established anticancer drugs in prolonging the survival of mice with intraperitoneally implanted mouse bladder carcinoma MB49. Dequalinium also inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted human colon carcinoma CX-1 in nude mice and recurrent rat colon carcinoma W163 in rats. Lipophilic cationic compounds, such as dequalinium, could comprise a unique class of anticarcinoma agents.\r"

Acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, bFGF) and the closely related astroglial growth factors AGF-1 and AGF-2 were studied for putative neurotrophic functions using dissociated, highly neuron-enriched cultures from chick and rat peripheral ganglia and central nervous system tissues. Embryonic chick ciliary ganglion neurons were the only peripheral neurons that responded to bFGF and AGF-2 by enhanced survival equivalent to that obtained with ciliary neurotrophic factor. Half-maximal effects were achieved with bFGF at 360 pg/ml or AGF-2 at 3 ng/ml. Small effects seen with aFGF could be potentiated by adding heparin at 1 microgram/ml. bFGF, but not ciliary neurotropic factor, also promoted neuron survival after the factor was bound to polyornithine and laminin. Both AGF-2 and ciliary neurotropic factor induced choline acetyltransferase activity during 48 hr. AGFs and FGFs also enhanced the long-term survival of embryonic chick spinal cord neurons, including motoneurons that had been retrogradely labeled with rhodamine isothiocyanate. These results demonstrate the potency of a class of mitogenic growth factors as neurotrophic agents for embryonic ciliary ganglion and spinal cord neurons--adding to the emerging evidence that mitogenic and neuronal growth factors are not strictly separate entities.\r"

Six to nine days after mRNA injection of the oocytes a cadmium-sensitive inward current could be detected in oocytes bathed in a calcium- and chloride-free solution containing 40 mM barium. This inward current could be distinguished from the native barium current of control oocytes by its high sensitivity to blockade by cadmium ions and its inhibition by omega-conotoxin, a peptide neurotoxin from Conus geographicus. Neither the current of control cells nor that of injected cells was detectably affected by nisoldipine (1 microM) or nitrendipine (1 microM). However, the barium current of control oocytes showed appreciably more inactivation (in the barium solution used for recording) than the omega-conotoxin-sensitive current that develops in mRNA-injected oocytes. Culturing of mRNA-injected oocytes in medium containing actinomycin D failed to prevent the appearance of the omega-conotoxin-sensitive current. These results support the conclusion that mRNA from Torpedo electric lobe is translated to produce an additional calcium channel in Xenopus oocytes. The features of this channel suggest that it may be the same type of calcium channel that controls transmitter release at nerve endings in Torpedo electroplax.\r"

Mu- and delta-opioid receptors are coupled to calcium- and/or voltage-dependent potassium channels and kappa-opioid receptors are coupled to voltage-dependent calcium channels. Using the single-electrode voltage-clamp technique, we investigated the effect of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist dynorphin A on somatic calcium currents of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in culture. Three different calcium currents were recorded: a small transient current activated positive to -60 mV; a large, inactivating current activated positive to -50 mV; and a moderate, slowly inactivating current activated positive to -40 mV. The first was less sensitive to cadmium block than the others. These calcium currents were similar to those described in other cells, which have been designated T, N, and L calcium currents, respectively. The opioid peptide dynorphin A reduced calcium current by selectively reducing the large inactivating (N) calcium current. Naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, reversed this action of dynorphin A. N calcium current is the predominant calcium current in DRG neurons. If N calcium channels are present in primary afferent terminals, and if they are coupled to kappa-opioid receptors as in the soma, these results suggest a mechanism by which dynorphin A inhibits calcium influx and neurotransmitter release.\r"

  ".W": "Cholinergic neurons are unique among cells since they alone utilize choline not only as a component of major membrane phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (Ptd-Cho), but also as a precursor of their neurotransmitter acetylcholine (AcCho). It has been hypothesized that choline-phospholipids might serve as a storage pool of choline for AcCho synthesis. The selective vulnerability of cholinergic neurons in certain neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer disease, motor neuron disorders) might result from the abnormally accelerated liberation of choline (to be used as precursor of AcCho) from membrane phospholipids, resulting in altered membrane composition and function and compromised neuronal viability. However, the proposed metabolic link between membrane turnover and AcCho synthesis has been difficult to demonstrate because of the heterogeneity of the preparations used. Here we used a population of purely cholinergic cells (human neuroblastoma, LA-N-2), incubated in the presence of [methyl-3H]methionine to selectively label PtdCho synthesized by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, the only pathway of de novo choline synthesis. PtdCho, purified by thin-layer chromatography, contained 90% of the label incorporated into lipids, demonstrating that LA-N-2 cells contained phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase. Three peaks of radioactive material that cochromatographed with authentic Ac-Cho, choline, and phosphocholine were observed when the water-soluble metabolites of the [3H]PtdCho were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Their identities were ascertained by subjecting them to enzymatic modifications with acetylcholinesterase, choline oxidase, and alkaline phosphatase, respectively. The results demonstrate that AcCho can be synthesized from choline derived from the degradation of endogenous PtdCho formed de novo by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine.\r"

Cleavage of disulfide bonds reveals two distinct alpha polypeptides and an additional component, delta. The alpha 1 subunit, a 175-kDa polypeptide that is not N-glycosylated, contains the dihydropyridine binding site, cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site(s), and substantial hydrophobic domain(s). alpha 2, a 143-kDa glycoprotein, has none of the properties characteristic of alpha 1 but binds lectins and contains about 25% N-linked carbohydrate. alpha 2 is disulfide-linked to delta, a 24- to 27-kDa glycopeptide. beta (54 kDa) contains a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site but is not N-glycosylated and does not have a hydrophobic domain. gamma (30 kDa) has a carbohydrate content of about 30% and extensive hydrophobic domain(s). Precipitation with affinity-purified anti-alpha 1 antibodies or alpha 2-specific lentil lectin-agarose demonstrated that alpha 1 alpha 2 beta gamma delta behaves as a complex in the presence of digitonin or 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, whereas the alpha 2 delta complex dissociates from alpha 1 beta gamma in the presence of Triton X-100. A model for subunit interaction and membrane insertion is proposed on the basis of these observations.\r"

The accessory radula closer (ARC) buccal muscles have been used to study this phenomenon, and it has been shown that changes in ARC muscle contraction are partially due to activity of a serotonergic neuron that modulates this muscle, by both a direct action and an action on two ARC motor neurons (B15 and B16). The motor neurons use acetylcholine as their excitatory transmitter, but they also contain bioactive peptides that can potentiate muscle contractions when they are exogenously applied. Motor neuron B15 contains the structurally related small cardioactive peptides A and B, whereas motor neuron B16 contains a different peptide--termed myomodulin. In the present study we determined the full amino acid sequence of myomodulin. Myomodulin is present in the ARC muscle, and exogenous application of the peptide potentiates ARC muscle contractions in a manner similar to the potentiation by small cardioactive peptides A and B. The structure of myomodulin, however, bears little resemblance to the small cardioactive peptides. Thus it appears that ARC muscle contractions may be regulated by at least three distinct classes of neuromodulators: serotonin, the small cardioactive peptides, and myomodulin.\r"

To gain insight into the role of small-airway epithelia in lung liquid balance, Clara cells were isolated from excised rabbit lungs by enzymatic digestion, enriched by centrifugal elutriation and density centrifugation, and further purified by differential adherence to collagen matrices. The resulting cell population was composed of 85% Clara cells, 3% ciliated cells, and less than 1% macrophages. The remainder of the cells were not definitively identified. The transepithelial potential difference peaked on day 3 in culture. Preparations studied in Ussing flux chambers exhibited a potential difference of 8 mV (apical bath negative), a resistance of 500 ohm X cm2, and an equivalent short-circuit current (ISCeq) of 16 microA/cm2. Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase by ouabain abolished ISCeq. Exposure of the apical surface to amiloride or replacement of Na+ in the apical bathing solution with an impermeant cation (N-methyl-D-glucamine) decreased ISCeq by 66% and 93%, respectively. Neither amiloride in the basolateral bathing solution, nor bumetanide, nor isoproterenol significantly altered basal ISCeq. These findings indicate that Clara cells in culture form polarized monolayers, Clara cells transport Na+ from the apical to the basolateral bathing solution, and the small airways of the rabbit may function in liquid absorption.\r"

Here, a sequence known to be a cis-dominant element of the replication origin of the plasmid is shown to contain a promoter for transcription. Both in vitro and in vivo assays have been used to define this promoter and show that a sequence located just 3' to the transcriptional start site is required for activity. This DNA sequence element, which has been defined through deletions, coincides with a binding site for a cellular factor and is also required for a functional origin of replication. Possible models for how a transcription factor may play a role in the regulation of DNA replication are discussed.\r"

Messenger RNA directed by a quiescent, rat prolactin promoter region stably transferred into mouse fibroblasts was detected only after fusion to rat pituitary cells, implying that pituitary cells contain a positive cell type--specific factor or factors. Nuclear run-on assays showed that fusion activation is transcriptional. Fusion did not activate either a stably transferred rat growth hormone gene promoter or expression of the endogenous silent fibroblast prolactin or growth hormone genes. Analysis by 5'-deletion mutation identified a 30-base pair DNA sequence required for cell fusion activation of the rat prolactin promoter region. Comparison with previous results from direct cellular transfer of this region implies that transfection-fusion identifies novel regulatory DNA sequences.\r"

The recombination frequencies on chromosomes 21 that had undergone nondisjunction were then compared to those on chromosomes 21 that had disjoined normally.

  ".W": "Mucormycosis is a mycotic disease caused by certain genera of the class Zygomycetes (order Mucorales). It is usually a rapidly progressive opportunistic infection characterized by vascular invasion, neutrophilic response, and intravascular thromboses. Entomophthoromycosis describes another disease caused by Zycomycetes, but of the order Entophthorales. In contrast to mucormycosis, entomophthoromycosis is not associated with underlying disease. Vascular invasion by the hyphae does not occur, and the hyphae are surrounded by eosinophilic sheathes. These sheathes are regarded as one form of the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. The authors report an unusual case of mucormycosis in a severely pancytopenic patient dying of acute myelogenous leukemia. At autopsy, eosinophilic sheathes with radiating fibrils were seen about intravascular hyphae, simulating entomophthoromycosis. This pseudo-Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon appears to be caused by adsorption of plasma and fibrin to the hyphal walls in the absence of both neutrophilic response and extensive fibrin clotting.\r"

Special attention was paid to the cases where discrepancy existed between these approaches and to a group of 11 patients considered as unclassifiable mainly because a second cell population--megakaryoblastic--was detected. Three types of discrepancies were observed: cases with typical morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry but devoid of lineage-specific antigens; these mainly include poorly differentiated leukemias (eight M1, four M2, and eight M5a), suggesting that the cytochemical enzymes are earlier myeloid markers than the currently available monoclonal antibodies; cases in which immunologic characteristics were discordant with morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry; these include two M2 cases positive for monocytic monoclonal antibodies (CD14); six M5b cases positive for granulocytic monoclonal antibodies (CD15); and seven M4 cases lacking in CD14 or CD15 antigens; cases with discrepancies between morphologic characteristics and cytochemistry and in which the immunologic markers permitted the correct assessment of cell lineage (six cases). These results show that the classification of these patients is better achieved by a combined morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic approach.\r"

One cDNA clone, c10, was found to be nearly identical to the previously mapped Hox-2.1 gene at 17q21. A second cDNA clone, c1, which is 87% homologous to Hox-2.2 at the nucleotide level but is distinct from Hox-2.1 and Hox-2.2, also maps to this region of human chromosome 17 and is probably another member of the Hox-2 cluster of homeo box-containing genes. The third cDNA clone, c8, in which the homeo box is approximately 84% homologous to the mouse Hox-1.1 homeo box region on mouse chromosome 6, maps to chromosome region 12q12----12q13, a region that is involved in chromosome abnormalities in human seminomas and teratomas. The fourth cDNA clone, c13, whose homeo box is approximately 73% homologous to the Hox-2.2 homeo box sequence, is located at chromosome region 2q31----q37. The human homeo box-containing cluster of genes at chromosome region 17q21 is the human cognate of the mouse homeo box-containing gene cluster on mouse chromosome 11. Other mouse homeo box-containing genes of the Antennapedia class (class I) map to mouse chromosomes 6 (Hox-1, proximal to the IgK locus) and 15 (Hox-3). A mouse gene, En-1, with an engrailed-like homeo box (class II) and flanking region maps to mouse chromosome 1 (near the dominant hemimelia gene). Neither of the class I homeo box-containing genes--c8 and c13--maps to a region of obvious homology to chromosomal positions of the presently known mouse homeo box-containing genes.\r"

Multipoint linkage analysis between several chromosome 13 markers and WND enables us to propose that the order of markers closely linked to WND is as follows: centromere-D13S10-ESD-WND.\r"

Response to conventional therapy with amphotericin B is poor, and 34.4 percent of the patients died with evidence of active fungal disease.

The purpose of the present review is to summarize, update, and evaluate information on moles with unusual karyotypes or origins. The important factor in the evolution of partial or complete moles appears to be the ratio of maternal to paternal chromosomes and not the ploidy of the tissue. Complete hydatidiform moles develop from androgenetic conceptions while partial hydatidiform moles develop from those conceptions in which the number of paternal sets of chromosomes exceeds the number of maternally derived sets. Rare cases inconsistent with this concept emphasize the value of examining morphologic features, cell ploidy, and genetic markers when one is attempting to classify hydatidiform moles.\r"

Local alterations of estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin concentrations may be present and be accompanied by prostaglandin changes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in concentrations of these hormones across the uterus and to evaluate their interrelationships in patients at term gestation with and without labor. Blood samples were obtained from a radial artery and a uterine vein in 22 women without and in 10 with labor. The difference between levels in the two blood vessels was designated as the gradient. Neither levels nor gradients were different between the two groups for estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone, or prolactin. The plasma levels of prostaglandin F2 alpha, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin F2 alpha, and prostaglandin E2 were significantly increased in labor. Prostacyclin levels, as indicated by the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha metabolite, were not altered. The gradients for prostaglandin F2 alpha and E2 were significantly increased in labor. The results of the study also suggested that, in gestation at term, serum prolactin is produced mainly by the pituitary and that estrone may originate from peripheral conversion of estradiol. We conclude that in humans prostaglandin gradients of the E and F groups are increased in labor. These increases are not associated with changes in sex steroids or prolactin. Prostacyclin metabolite gradients also appear not to be altered in labor, suggesting that some prostaglandins are selectively increased in early labor either by enhanced production or decreased metabolism or both.\r"

All histologic types, including mucinous tumors, were associated with raised CA 125 levels. There was a positive correlation with tumor burden and an inverse correlation with degree of differentiation. In patients undergoing radical operation an elevated CA 125 level was a bad prognostic index. Serial CA 125 measurements were assessable in 112 patients undergoing chemotherapy. Rising or falling levels correlated with disease in 92% of the cases. The CA 125 level increased before clinical progression with a median lead time of 3 months. Only patients who showed objective response to chemotherapy had a decrease in antigen levels of greater than or equal to 30% 4 weeks after the first course of chemotherapy and a normalization of CA 125 levels 3 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Rising levels were always associated with progression. These data suggest that CA 125 may aid in early identification of nonresponders. However, a normal CA 125 level does not exclude the presence of disease.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of parathyroidectomy was studied for 75 weeks in two dogs. After parathyroidectomy, the dogs required intravenous and intramuscular calcium supplementation for 1 week. Despite calcium supplementation, in 2 weeks the ionized calcium (Ca++) level fell from 4.67 mg/dl to 2.39 mg/dl. The Ca++ level rose to 4.25 mg/dl by 7 weeks after which the intramuscular calcium supplement was gradually weaned so that no calcium was given after 20 weeks. The Ca++ level stabilized at 3.15 to 3.25 mg/dl after 20 weeks. Postoperative parathormone (PTH) levels remained low. The response to hemorrhagic shock in these two calcium-independent dogs was compared with that seen in two calcium-dependent dogs 4 weeks after parathyroidectomy and to that seen in two euparathyroid dogs. Shock caused a sharp decrease in Ca++ in all animals that had parathyroid ectomy. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was elevated preoperatively in these dogs and fell markedly during shock. Ca++ remained normal and PGE2 increased slightly after shock in the euparathyroid dogs. Cardiac output rose with resuscitation in the euparathyroid dogs but remained constant in the calcium-dependent dogs and increased slightly in the calcium independent parathyroidectomized animals. PTH levels were low in the parathyroidectomy groups and did not react to shock. PTH increased markedly after resuscitation in the euparathyroid dogs, suggesting its role as an acute-phase hormone. All levels returned to baseline levels within 3 days after shock. Adaptation to hypocalcemia occurs in parathyroidectomized dogs and involves PGE2 as well as other factors. Hemorrhagic shock exceeds this compensatory response which in euparathyroid dogs involves active PTH release in response to hypocalcemia.\r"

Of the 22 patients, there were 9 with gastrinomas; 3 with glucagonomas; 4 with insulinomas; 1 with ectopic production of parathyroid hormone; and 3 with mixed syndromes. The only biochemical marker in 1 patient was pancreatic polypeptide, and 1 patient had no demonstrable peptide production from the tumor. In 14 patients, dramatic decreases in the levels of circulating peptides (insulin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastrin, and glucagon) have been accompanied by major alleviations of symptoms. Steatorrhea appears to be the most significant toxicity. This analogue of somatostatin may be appropriate for use as early therapy in patients who have symptoms from syndromes related to islet cell carcinomas but in whom there is no immediate threat from tumor progression.\r"

The in vivo activity of these drugs was evaluated in a standardized and reproducible mouse model of systemic infection. Each single antibiotic was injected intravenously 30 h after intravenous inoculation of Y. enterocolitica WA. In vivo efficacy was measured by counting the viable bacteria recovered from the whole spleens of mice sacrificed at selected times. Doxycycline and gentamicin were active in stopping bacterial proliferation. Cefotaxime and imipenem, even at high doses (250 and 100 mg/kg of body weight, respectively), were totally ineffective, as was amoxycillin. Bacterial inocula (10(7)), recovered from either the in vitro growth or the infected spleens, were plated on cefotaxime or imipenem concentration gradients in agar; no emergence of beta-lactam-resistant organisms was detected. Based on these experiments it is not possible to explain, from any given property of the antibiotic, the bacteria, or the host, the discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro activities of cefotaxime and imipenem. On the basis of these results, the use of newer beta-lactam antibiotics should be delayed in the therapy of human Y. enterocolitica infections until further investigations are carried out.\r"

  ".W": "Enoxacin is a potent quinolone derivative with marked activity against gram-negative bacteria and staphylococci. The oral preparation has a potential role in treatment of gram-negative-bacterial lower respiratory infections if found to give adequate bronchial (sputum) concentrations. A study was done to determine the concomitant serum and bronchial concentrations of oral enoxacin after dosing with 600 mg, single dose; 400 mg, single dose; and 400 mg every 12 h, four doses. Blood and bronchial secretions were collected from 20 patients predose and 2, 5, and 9 h postdose. Bronchial secretions were obtained from tracheostomies, endotracheal tubes, or bronchoscopy. Levels of enoxacin in serum and sputum were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Mean peak bronchial secretion levels were similar for the 400-mg dose schedules (2.2 and 2.4 micrograms/ml) but were significantly higher with the 600-mg dose (4.0 micrograms/ml) (P less than 0.05). Significant concentrations in bronchial secretions were still achievable at 9 h postdose (1.3 to 2.3 micrograms of enoxacin per ml). The mean ratios of enoxacin concentrations in sputum to those in serum at various time intervals for all groups were as follows: at 2 h, 0.55 +/- 0.34; at 5 h, 1.04 +/- 0.72; at 9 h, 0.97 +/- 0.62. Considering that most gram-negative bacteria are inhibited by 1.0 microgram of enoxacin per ml in vitro, this study shows that oral enoxacin in practical doses achieves a concentration in bronchial secretions that is adequate to treat most gram-negative-bacterial lower respiratory infections.\r"

It has not previously been reported as a sign of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We suggest the term acral lividosis to describe this clinical entity in patients with any myeloproliferative disease. We propose that the pathophysiology of acral lividosis in CML involves occlusion of small blood vessels of the skin by large, nondeformable myeloblasts, a process that has been shown histologically to occur in other organs in patients with CML. This process, called leukostasis, occurs in patients with CML who have over 50.0 X 10(9)/L (50,000/mm3) circulating myeloblasts. Patients manifest cardiorespiratory and central nervous system compromise, a clinical constellation known as the hyperleukocytosis syndrome. Acral lividosis occurred in a patient with CML in whom nearly every organ demonstrated leukostasis on autopsy.\r"

These saccharides are bound to other sugars that likely account for an integral part of glycoprotein and/or glycolipid deposits on lens surfaces. These tear deposits may contribute to the chemical spoilage of the lens and, furthermore, may serve as specific receptors for pathogenic microorganisms commonly implicated in extended-wear soft contact lens-associated infectious keratitis.\r"

The percent G-actin (of total actin) was measured by DNAase I inhibition, F-actin was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of nitrobenzoxadiazol (NBD)-phallacidin-stained cells, and ROL was measured by computer-assisted analysis of the tracks of individual cells. Uninduced HL-60 cells moved slowly (2.3 +/- 1.0 microns/min) and showed no change in ROL or in the state of actin polymerization when stimulated by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Nonstimulated cells induced to differentiate with dimethylformamide had no change in the degree of actin polymerization but exhibited a mean (m) ROL similar to normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) (8.6 +/- 1.4 micron/min [HL-60 cells] v 7.8 +/- 1.8 microns/min [PMN]. When induced HL-60 cells were stimulated with fMLP, actin polymerization occurred. The F-actin content increased, as determined by FACS analysis of NBD-phallacidin-stained cells, and the percentage of G-actin decreased, as determined by a 24.5% decrease in DNAase I inhibitory activity. However, induced HL-60 cells stimulated with fMLP did not increase their mROL. These studies show that, unlike normal human PMN, chemotactic peptides can cause an intracellular biochemical change that is not associated with a chemokinetic response in induced HL-60 cells. The HL-60 cell line may be a useful model to study the development of chemotactic peptide-mediated actin polymerization during myeloid cell maturation.\r"

Leukemia cells obtained from peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens before and after initiation of chemotherapy were analyzed for c-sis gene expression by the RNA-DNA dot blot hybridization. Although the level varied, the mRNA of the c-sis gene was detected in all megakaryoblastic leukemia cells obtained at different clinical stages. The c-sis mRNA level in cells obtained after relapse was higher than that obtained before the initiation of therapy. The 25S c-sis mRNA was detected in a megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line established from this patient. The role of the expression of the c-sis gene in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cells is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87272044\r", 
  ".W": "A new human diploid cell line, designated PLB-985, has been established from the peripheral blood of a patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Cells of this line are capable of granulocytic and monocytic maturation in the presence of inducing agents. By morphology, the analysis of surface antigens, and cytochemical staining PLB-985 cells are myelomonoblasts. Transmission electron microscopy reveals them to be devoid of neutrophilic primary or secondary granules and to have an open chromatin pattern with frequent nucleoli. The modal karyotype of the line is 46,XX, with no consistent marker chromosomes or recognizable translocations. Myelomonoblasts of this line form colonies in soft agar and induce tumors (chloromas) in nude mice. Growth of the cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, cis-retinoic acid, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate results in granulocytic maturation as determined by morphology, histochemical staining characteristics, and incorporation of 35S-methionine into the neutrophil primary granule proteinases elastase and cathepsin G. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate induces PLB-985 cells to differentiate as monocytes. Cells grown in the presence of this agent rapidly become adherent to plastic, display markedly increased phagocytosis of latex particles, stain positively for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, and lose the ability to synthesize the neutrophilic proteinases. Induction of differentiation along either pathway is accompanied by a marked decrease in myc oncogene transcription.\r"

This method is based on our finding that cocultivation of lethally irradiated HTLV-producing cells with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) preactivated for 24 hours with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces colony formation in methylcellulose-containing medium. Colonies of about 200 cells can be clearly distinguished from background aggregates within four to six days after cocultivation. These colonies gradually increase in size and reach 300 to 1,000 cells within 14 days after cocultivation. Cells of these colonies were infected, as evidenced by expression of viral p19 antigen and the presence of HTLV proviral sequences. These cells proved to be transformed in terms of IL-2-independent continuous growth in liquid medium. Colony formation was found to depend in a linear fashion upon the percentage of the infected cells present in the irradiated cell population and is sufficiently sensitive to detect as few as 1% of virus-producing cells.\r"

The tumor occurred principally as a soft tissue mass in an extremity, with a predilection for the thighs (lower extremity, 46.6%; upper extremity, 20.5%) and the retroperitoneum (17%). Most were deep-seated and were firmly attached to the fascia, but occasionally they were freely movable and confined to the subcutis or dermis. Nearly all presented as an insidiously growing mass rarely causing pain or tenderness. The preoperative duration of symptoms ranged from 2 weeks to 25 years (median, 6 months). In 17 cases, it exceeded 2 years. A history of prior trauma to the site of the tumor was stated in 11 of the 88 cases (12.5%) and of radiation in five cases (5.7%). Microscopically, the tumors contained varying amounts of neoplastic osteoid and bone, sometimes together with islands of malignant-appearing cartilage. Like osteosarcoma of bone, extraskeletal osteosarcoma showed a striking variation in histologic appearance and focally resembled malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant schwannoma. Follow-up information was available for 65 patients. Eight (12.3%) patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence; 12 (18.5%) patients were alive with one or more recurrences; and five (7.6%) were alive with metastases. Twenty-eight of the tumors (43%) recurred and 39 (63%) metastasized. Forty (61.5%) of the patients with follow-up information had died, 36 from the tumor and four from miscellaneous causes. The prevailing sites of metastases were the lung, the regional lymph nodes, and bone.\r"

In our series ACA were rare (five of 28 patients) and simple (four of five) in CP. They were much more frequent and complex in AP (11 of 16) and in BT (22 of 24) with complex abnormalities (13 of 24). In CP, ACA predictive value for metamorphosis was poor: only three of 13 patients had ACA within 1 year before BT, and only two of 11 within 1 year before AP. ACA were mainly observed during the last period before BT: ten of 17 patients studied within 6 months prior BT had ACA, but by then two of three were in AP. ACA, especially when complex, appear to be a hallmark of CML metamorphosis.\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of the stomach for 30 min to acidified sodium taurocholate (TC) (1-20 mM) or sodium salicylate (SA) (10-80 mM) caused a reduction of transmucosal PD and an increase of luminal pH in anesthetized rats, in a concentration-related manner. Acidified aspirin (ASA) (10-80 mM) reduced PD in the same manner, without significant effect on pH. Histologically, these agents similarly produced damage to the surface cells. After a 30-min exposure to either 20 mM TC or 40 mM SA, acid secretion ceased and bicarbonate (0.5-1 mumol/10 min) appeared in the lumen, whereas acid secretion persisted in the stomach exposed to 40 mM ASA. However, under cimetidine infusion (8 mg/kg/hr) these agents produced similar degrees of luminal alkalinization (approximately 1 mumol/10 min). Pretreatment with indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) significantly inhibited the increase of pH seen after exposure to 20 mM TC, but had no effect on the increase of pH caused by 40 mM SA. Concurrent administration of 16,16-dmPGE2 (3 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously) significantly antagonized the effect of indomethacin in the stomach exposed to 20 mM TC and even increased the pH in the stomach exposed to 40 mM ASA. After a 3-hr exposure to these agents, there was macroscopically apparent damage only in the stomach exposed to ASA, although the PD was similarly reduced in response to either agent. The levels of PGE2 in the corpus mucosa were significantly increased in stomachs exposed to 20 mM TC and 40 mM SA, but decreased in those exposed to 40 mM ASA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin has been shown to increase blood pressure in normotensive individuals. The effect of other NSAID on blood pressure has not been as well studied. We evaluated the effects of ibuprofen, an NSAID currently available without a prescription, on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in ten young, healthy, normotensive women. Using a randomized, crossover, double-blind design, subjects received ibuprofen 800 mg and a placebo identical in appearance to ibuprofen three times a day for eight days with a washout period between regimens. Subjects were instructed to follow a no-added salt diet during the study. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure monitoring and 24-hour urine collection for prostaglandin E2, creatinine, and sodium were performed on days 1 and 8 of each study week. Tablet counts and a 40 percent reduction in urinary prostaglandin E2 documented compliance with ibuprofen. Ibuprofen had no significant effect on systolic or diastolic blood pressure at any hour during the 24-hour period. Mean blood pressure for the 24-hour period was 112/73 and 111/73 mm Hg on day 1 and 111/73 and 112/73 mm Hg on day 8 for placebo and ibuprofen, respectively. We conclude that ibuprofen at doses as high as 2400 mg/d for up to seven days has no effect on blood pressure in normotensive women. Further studies are needed in hypertensive subjects.\r"

Animals given hCG (n = 12) ovulated within a 2-day period (days 9 and 10 after prostaglandin) compared with a 4-day period (days 9 to 12) in the control group (n = 12). The mean interval to ovulation was similar in both groups. There was no difference in the timing of the preovulatory estradiol (E2) peak between groups, although E2 levels on the day of hCG injection were lower than in controls on the day of the onset of the luteinizing hormone surge. All animals given hCG ovulated and 11 of 12 became pregnant. Ten of 11 embryos recovered surgically from six of these animals were normal blastocysts; 5 of the remaining 6 animals carried pregnancies to term. The results are of practical importance for experiments involving follicular and oocyte maturation and the collection and transfer of embryos.\r"

  ".W": "A 17-yr-old boy developed acute proctosigmoiditis after the institution of isotretinoin for the treatment of cystic acne vulgaris. Painless diarrhea, accompanied by mucus and eventually blood, began within days of commencing treatment and persisted while the drug was administered. At sigmoidoscopy patchy mucosal inflammation associated with numerous discrete aphthous ulcers was seen, apparently restricted to the rectosigmoid. Histologic examination of the affected mucosa revealed an acute focal superficial inflammatory infiltrate. Withdrawal of the drug resulted in prompt resolution of symptoms and a reduction in the severity of the inflammation. Rechallenge with isotretinoin induced a second, almost identical, attack of proctosigmoiditis. Withdrawal was again followed by disappearance of symptoms, and a subsequent sigmoidoscopy and mucosal biopsy were normal. The patient has remained clinically well for 16 mo after his initial presentation. Although the pathogenesis of the colonic mucosal inflammation remains unknown, the relationship of the bouts of proctosigmoiditis to the administration of isotretinoin strongly suggests that the drug was directly responsible.\r"

  ".W": "Factors influencing the mechanical performance of neonatal high-frequency ventilators of diverse design were assessed under controlled conditions. Each of eight ventilators was coupled to in vitro models of the neonatal respiratory system simulating disease of varying severity. The principal performance characteristics examined were frequency dependence and load dependence of tidal volume delivered, peak inspiratory flow rate, and waveforms of pressure at either end of the endotracheal tube. Despite wide diversity of ventilator designs, including jets, flow interrupters, and oscillators, common features emerged. In almost all devices tidal volume increased with endotracheal tube size, was invariant with respiratory system compliance, and decreased with frequency of oscillation. Peak inspiratory flow rates for a given tidal volume and frequency were smallest in the group of oscillators compared with jets and flow interrupters. Proximal pressure was a poor indicator of distal pressure. These findings suggest that delivered tidal volume may be sensitive to endotracheal tube size and airway patency but relatively insensitive to changes in lung tissue or chest wall mechanical properties. In these regards high-frequency ventilation differs from pressure-limited conventional mechanical ventilation. Comparison of data obtained at different clinical centers using high-frequency ventilators of varying design may be possible by taking these factors into account.\r"

  ".W": "We describe an apparatus for altering the mechanical load against which the respiratory muscles operate in humans. A closed system incorporates a rolling seal spirometer. The spirometer piston shaft is coupled to a fast-responding linear actuator that develops force in proportion to desired command signals. The command signal may be flow (resistive loading or unloading), volume (elastic loading or unloading), constant voltage (continuous positive or negative pressure), or any external function. Combinations of loads can be applied. Logic circuits permit application of the load at specific times during the respiratory cycle, and the magnitude of the loads is continuously adjustable. Maximum pressure output is +/- 20 cmH2O. The apparatus permits loading or unloading over a range of ventilation extending from resting levels to those observed during high levels of exercise (over 100 l/min). In response to a square-wave input, pressure rises exponentially with a time constant of 20 ms.\r"

Abnormalities in antigen expression were summarised as a score, and cases were divided into low (few abnormalities) and high (many abnormalities) groups. Survival was significantly worse in the \"high\" group (logrank chi 2 = 5.793, p = 0.016), this group having a median survival of 31 weeks, compared with more than 67 weeks in the \"low\" group. No correlations were found between the score and any of the following: peripheral blood platelet and granulocyte count; FAB subtype; bone marrow blast cells and sideroblast count, or erythroid and myeloid progenitor growth. Antigen expression was also studied in six further cases of MDS before and after six weeks of treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid (CRA), 20 mg given orally, and a comparison was made with six untreated patients studied before and after a similar time interval. In the treated group 58% of initially abnormal measurements reverted to normal, compared with 24% in the untreated group. Five of the six treated patients showed a decrease in the score, whereas only two of the six improved in the untreated group. The data indicate that myeloid antigen expression is a useful indicator of prognosis in MDS, and that antigen expression may be affected by treatment.\r"

These included cases of M7 acute myeloid leukaemia and blast crises of chronic granulocytic leukaemia. The megakaryoblastic nature of the blasts was first established using two monoclonal antibodies against platelet glycoproteins, and by estimating the platelet/peroxidase reaction at ultrastructural level. Our findings suggest that megakaryoblasts have a typical cytochemical profile comprising positive ANAE staining and acid phosphatase activity with a predominant localisation in the Golgi zone and negative or weak ANBE activity. A similar positive cytochemical pattern was also found in five cases of erythroleukaemia (M6). The specificity of the 5'nucleotidase activity for megakaryoblasts was not confirmed. In most cases of megakaryoblastic leukaemia there was no 5'nucleotidase activity only two cases showed positive reactions--reactions were positive in several cases of myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukaemia. We suggest that cytochemical methods may be useful in diagnosing M6 and M7 acute leukaemia because less than 40% of leukaemic cells react with specific monoclonal antibodies.\r"
