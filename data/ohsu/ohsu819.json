To address this problem, we interviewed a randomly selected sample of 215 Vietnamese adults living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Results indicated that 13% had never heard of cancer, 27% did not know that cigarette smoking can cause cancer, and 28% believed that cancer is contagious. Although hepatitis B-related liver cancer is endemic among Vietnamese, 48% had never heard of hepatitis B. Among men (n = 116), 56% were smokers (versus 32% in the general US population). Male cigarette smoking was significantly associated with incomes below the poverty level (P less than .01), residence in the US for 9 years or less (P less than .05), not knowing that smoking causes cancer (P less than .05), and limited English proficiency (P less than .01). Binge drinking was reported by 35% of men. Young Vietnamese of both sexes reported consuming diets higher in fat and lower in fiber than when they lived in Vietnam. Among eligible women, 32% had never had a Papanicolaou test (versus 9% of US women), 28% had never had a breast examination (versus 16%), and 83% had never had a mammogram (versus 62%). Education about cancer and its risk factors, smoking cessation, and cancer screening are high priorities for this population.\r"

Statistical analysis failed to show a significant difference between the trauma-care patients transported by helicopter (n = 109) and those transported by fixed-wing (n = 86) for age, injury severity score, hospital length of stay, hospital mortality, or discharge disability score. The times in returning patients to the receiving hospital by helicopter (n = 104) versus fixed-wing (n = 509) did not differ significantly. Helicopter transport costs per mile ($24), however, were 400% higher than those of fixed-wing aircraft with its associated ground ambulance transport costs ($6). Thus, helicopter transport is economically unjustified for interhospital transports exceeding 100 radial miles when an efficient fixed-wing service exists.\r"

  ".W": "Signal-averaged ECG has been used to identify patients at risk for ventricular tachycardia and sudden death after myocardial infarction. The goals of this prospective study were to examine the effects of reperfusion achieved with thrombolytic therapy on the 12-lead signal-averaged ECG and on ventricular arrhythmias in the early period after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A total of 190 consecutive patients with AMI who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Thrombolysis was attempted in 80 patients and was considered successful in 57 (group I) and unsuccessful in 23 (group II); 110 patients were not treated with thrombolytic agents (group III). Signal averaging of 12 ECG leads was performed within 2 days in all patients and between 7 and 10 days after admission in 163 patients. The filtered QRS complex duration (QRSD) was significantly shorter in group I compared to group III in 7 of 12 ECG leads at 2 days and in 10 of 12 leads at 7 to 10 days. The root mean square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS complex (RMS40) did not change between the two signal-averaged ECG recordings in group I, whereas it became lower in three ECG leads in group II and in seven ECG leads in group III. There was no correlation between infarct site and significant changes in infarct-related signal-averaged ECG leads. The occurrence of complex ventricular arrhythmias was not significantly different among the three groups. We conclude that successful reperfusion, compared with failed and nonattempted reperfusion, is associated with fewer abnormalities in the 12-lead signal-averaged ECG in the early period after AMI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of intravenous streptokinase on a creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) reperfusion index and an ECG estimate of myocardial salvage was therefore studied in 65 patients with a first AMI, randomized to treatment with streptokinase (n = 33) or placebo (control group, n = 32). Reperfusion was defined as a CK-MB appearance rate constant (k1) greater than 0.185. The final AMI size was first predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation. The final AMI size was estimated from the QRS score on the predischarge ECG. Myocardial salvage was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decrease from predicted to final AMI size. The k1 value in the control group was significantly lower than that in the streptokinase group (median 0.157 versus 0.328; p = 0.0001). Accordingly the reperfusion rate was higher in the streptokinase group than in the control group (88% versus 34%; p = 0.0002). The difference in AMI size (final-predicted) was significantly greater in the streptokinase group than in the control group (median -7% versus +1%; p = 0.0001). Myocardial salvage occurred in 60% and 19%, respectively (p = 0.004). A significant correlation was found between CK-MB reperfusion and ECG salvage: 19 of 20 streptokinase-treated patients with salvage also had reperfusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by radioactive microspheres, regional segment shortening by sonomicrometry, and infarct size by the triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain. Infarct size expressed as a percentage of the area at risk was significantly reduced by the intravenous administration of two structurally unrelated PAF antagonists, BN 52021 (10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg/hr) and CV-3988 (3 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg/hr). Infarct size was 38% +/- 5% in the saline (control) group, (n = 7), 22% +/- 5% in the BN 52021 group (n = 7), and 19% +/- 5% in the CV-3988 group (n = 8). However, the intravenous administration of BN 52021 (5 and 10 mg/kg) and CV-3988 (5 mg/kg) had no effect on functional recovery (regional segment shortening) in the stunned myocardium after brief occlusion and reperfusion. Regional myocardial blood flow, hemodynamic data, and the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias were not significantly affected by PAF antagonists in both series of experiments at any time. These data suggest that PAF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of an evolving myocardial infarction that follows a prolonged coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Furthermore, PAF antagonists may have a beneficial role in reduction of the injury produced during an acute infarction. Finally, these data indicate that PAF does not appear to be an important mediator of myocardial stunning.\r"

There was no significant difference between group I and group II patients in mean age (56 +/- 3 versus 57 +/- 2 years), percent male sex (76% versus 68%), or frequency of left anterior descending (LAD) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (33% versus 32%), p = NS for all. All lesions post PTCA were less than or equal to 50% stenosed and no patient had coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Mean post PTCA stenosis was 29 +/- 2% for group I versus 33 +/- 2% for group II, p = NS. Clinical follow-up was available for all patients 8 +/- 0.6 months after PTCA. Recurrent symptoms were present in 8 of 21 (38%) group I patients compared with 12 of 28 (43%) patients in group II, p = NS. Angiographic follow-up was available in 32 patients (65%), with confirmation of restenosis in seven (33%) group I patients and in 11 (39%) group II patients, p = NS. In conclusion, this prospective study suggests that recurrence rates following successful PTCA of nonacute total occlusions is not modified by 5-minute versus 1-minute inflations.\r"

The 54 patients (7%) requiring contrast agent doses greater than or equal to 400 ml were examined in detail. The mean contrast dose in this group was 496 +/- 76 ml (range 400 to 785 ml). Their mean age was 63 +/- 11 years (range 36 to 83 years), 10 patients had diabetes mellitus (19%), and four patients had a baseline creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl (7%). Following coronary angioplasty, the serum creatinine rose from 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.3 (p = 0.08). The creatinine rose greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dl in six patients (11%) and greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/dl in one patient (2%). Five of these six patients had either diabetes mellitus, baseline renal insufficiency, or both. Oliguria was not observed. The most important procedural factors contributing to the high doses of contrast media were multilesion and multivessel angioplasty in 96% and 83% of patients, respectively, prior bypass surgery in 52%, and combined diagnostic cardiac catheterization and angioplasty in 13%. Thus renal dysfunction following high-dose contrast agent administration during complex coronary angioplasty is infrequently associated with nephrotoxicity. Whenever possible, contrast doses in patients with diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency should be minimized.\r"

We studied 152 patients (121 men and 31 women) who had ischemic ST depression (greater than or equal to 0.05 mV) during exercise tests and greater than or equal to 70% narrowing in the three major coronary arteries. According to the presence or absence of chest pain during exercise, they were divided into symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients: 104 patients without pathologic Q waves (Q(-) group) and 48 patients with pathologic Q waves (Q(+) group). In the Q(-) group, symptomatic patients (n = 56) had a significantly greater number of leads showing ST depression (p less than 0.0002), a greater maximum voltage of ST depression (p less than 0.005), a higher incidence of negative U waves (p less than 0.001), and a poorer blood pressure response (p less than 0.005) than asymptomatic patients (n = 48). However, in the Q(+) group, there were no significant differences between symptomatic (n = 24) and asymptomatic patients (n = 24) with regard to these parameters. We concluded that symptomatic patients without pathologic Q waves had more severe ischemia. On the other hand, in patients with pathologic Q waves, the severity of myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients might be equal to that in symptomatic patients. Chest pain during exercise testing is not a good predictor of myocardial ischemia in patients with pathologic Q waves. The presence or absence of pathologic Q waves is an important factor in the analysis of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.\r"

ST isointegral maps were constructed and the locations of ST changes were compared with the findings of exercise thallium-201 (TI-201) myocardial scanning. Exercise-induced ST elevation was observed in 14 patients (27%) on the lower chest and on the back, corresponding to the infarcted area. Exercise-induced ST depression was observed more frequently in the MVD group (n = 30, 75%) than in the 1VD group (n = 2, 17%). Seventeen (77%) of 22 patients with ST depression had thallium-201 redistribution. There was a significant association between ST depression and TI-201 redistribution (chi2 = 13.1, p less than 0.001), but no association between ST depression and ST elevation. The body surface distribution of ST depression was shifted upward and rightward compared with its appearance in angina pectoris without MI. These findings suggest that exercise-induced ST depression reflects myocardial ischemia in patients with previous inferior MI.\r"

Functional status before PMV was New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IV in two, class III in 38, and class II in 31. Pre and post PMV and follow-up mean diastolic mitral gradient by catheter method was 17.5 +/- 6.9, 2.7 +/- 3.5, and 3.3 +/- 3.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 pre versus post PMV and pre PMV versus follow-up; and p greater than 0.005 post PMV versus follow-up). By Doppler method the mean diastolic gradient was 17.4 +/- 5.5, 8.5 +/- 4.7, and 9.2 +/- 4.1 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.001 pre versus post PMV and pre PMV versus follow-up; and p greater than 0.05 post PMV versus follow-up). Mitral valve area was 1.12 +/- 0.26, 2.04 +/- 0.41, and 1.92 +/- 0.45 cm2, respectively (p greater than 0.001 pre versus post PMV and pre PMV versus follow-up; and p less than 0.05 post PMV versus follow-up). The phonocardiographic and vectorcardiographic studies and cardiopulmonary exercise testing showed significant improvement after PMV and at follow-up. At follow-up the NYHA functional class was 1 in 57 patients, class II in 13, and class III in one patient with severe mitral valve calcification and subvalvular fusion, in whom restenosis occurred 18 months after PMV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of age, sex, functional class, left atrial size, two-dimensional anatomic features of the valve, incidence of mild basal mitral regurgitation, or ejection fraction. A comparative analysis of both groups showed no significant differences in terms of changes in the mean gradient, mitral valve area, and incidence of severe postvalvuloplasty mitral regurgitation (9.5% versus 5.5%). Echo-Doppler follow-up studies (11 +/- 7 months) showed persistent gradient relief in either group.

Eight normal males participated in the randomized cross-over trial. They took propranolol, 40 mg every 6 hours for 6 days, and nadolol, 80 mg daily for 7 days. Exercise- and isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate and pulse pressure were significantly less than control values during treatment with both drugs (p less than 0.05). Significant hypersensitivity of heart rate response was seen on days 2, 3, and 7 after propranolol withdrawal (p less than 0.05) and on day 6 after nadolol withdrawal (p less than 0.005). Hypersensitive responses to isoproterenol were seen after propranolol withdrawal; no evidence of hypersensitivity to isoproterenol was seen after nadolol withdrawal. The area under the heart rate response, time curve after nadolol withdrawal was significantly less than that after propranolol withdrawal (20.3 beats/min.day vs 44.9 beats/min.day, respectively, (p less than 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between the degree of hypersensitivity and nadolol pharmacokinetic half-life (r = -0.80, p less than 0.02). We conclude that abrupt withdrawal of a beta-blocker with a long half-life may protect against the development of the beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Peak aortic blood flow acceleration and velocity measured by Doppler echocardiography have been documented to be accurate descriptors of left ventricular systolic function. Both acceleration and velocity are reduced in the presence of beta-blockade at rest and during exercise. Whether and to what extent the simultaneous alterations in heart rate (HR) due to beta-blockade affect these parameters has received little study. In order to determine the influence of alterations in HR on Doppler measurements of velocity and acceleration, 10 healthy men were studied during upright exercise under control conditions, following propranolol administration, and following propranolol plus transesophageal atrial pacing. In addition, we assessed the response of stroke volume (measured as flow velocity integral) during beta-blocked and control exercise. Propranolol significantly reduced acceleration and velocity during all stages of exercise compared with control values (p less than 0.05). Increasing the HR during exercise via pacing had no effect on acceleration or velocity compared with propranolol administration alone, thus demonstrating that during upright exercise, changes in acceleration and velocity are independent of alterations in HR. At low levels of exercise, propranolol significantly reduced flow velocity integral (FVI) compared with control (-1.14 cm, p less than 0.05.). At high levels of exertion, however, FVI exceeded values obtained during control conditions (1.2 cm at stage 4). Pacing during beta-blockade reduced FVI at high levels of exercise but had no effect at lower levels. Our results suggest that during low levels of exercise stroke volume is increased as a consequence of both increased contractility and augmented left ventricular filling.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of an aerobic conditioning program on cardiopulmonary markers of fitness was assessed in 22 older patients (mean age 68 years) following a coronary event compared with 37 younger patients (mean age 52 years). Before conditioning, peak oxygen consumption was lower in the older patients, 16.9 versus 24.3 cm3/kg/min (p less than 0.001), as was exercise duration and maximal ventilation. Older coronary patients were more likely to stop exercise at a respiratory equivalent ratio of less than 1.00 (8 of 22 versus 4 of 37, p less than 0.05) and therefore often did not attain a true maximal cardiopulmonary limitation. Both groups had similar increases in peak oxygen consumption following a 36-session conditioning program, improving 27% in the older group and 23% in the younger group. Duration of treadmill exercise on a Balke treadmill protocol increased similarly in the two groups, 62% in the older group (from 8.9 to 14.3 minutes) and 40% in the younger group (from 12.2 to 17.1 minutes) (p = NS). Thus while older patients following coronary events are substantially less fit than younger patients, they obtain a similar relative improvement of aerobic capacity with a graded conditioning program.\r"

Among a series of 203 consecutive isolated heart studies, 13 instances of ventricular fibrillation occurred. These arrhythmias developed during pretreatment with isoproterenol, dobutamine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, digoxin, and 4 mmol/L calcium in the perfusate. Alternans behavior of calcium transients occurred in three cases; premature beats preceded ventricular fibrillation in six cases. Premature beats led to a further increase in the free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) concentration, resulting in a stronger contraction with the subsequent beat and/or the initiation of ventricular fibrillation. Two distinct patterns of calcium transients were seen: ventricular fibrillation type 1 showed fast disorganized transients with small amplitude and an irregular, nonuniform tracing; type 2 revealed fast activity and multiform, polymorphous transients with marked changes in amplitude. Independent of the morphologic type of fibrillation, [Ca2+]i remained constant or even increased during an observation time up to 9 minutes. No intracellular hypocalcemia was observed. Isoproterenol pretreatment resulted in [Ca2+]i levels in the range of the end-diastolic calcium level of the last regular contraction. Fibrillating calcium transients after norepinephrine, dobutamine, phenylephrine, digoxin, high calcium, and fast pacing were in the previous end-systolic range. It is suggested that inotropic agents acting without a major elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate result in higher [Ca2+]i.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the relation between a new quantitative index of concealed atrioventricular nodal (AVN) conduction and the variability of ventricular response during atrial fibrillation in 12 patients without preexcitation. The second atrial extrastimulus (A3) was introduced following the first extrastimulus (A2), which was fixed at a coupling interval 20 to 40 msec longer than the AVN effective refractory period (ERP) during a basic atrial drive (A1) cycle length of 400 to 750 msec. The AVNERP of conducted A2 defined as the longest A2A3 interval at which A3 was not conducted to the His bundle was determined. This pacing sequence was repeated, whereas A2 was fixed at a coupling interval 20 to 40 msec shorter than the AVNERP, which means A2 was concealed within the AVN. Thus AVNERP of blocked A2, defined as the longest A2A3 interval at which A3 was not conducted to the His bundle, was measured. Concealment index (AVNERP of blocked A2/AVNERP of conducted A2) was developed to quantitate the magnitude of concealed penetration into the AVN by A2. During atrial fibrillation induced by premature or rapid atrial stimulation, the coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of R-R intervals and the maximum R-R/minimum R-R interval were significantly correlated with the concealment index (r = 0.838, p less than 0.001; r = 0.678, p less than 0.05). However, neither of these parameters was correlated with AVNERP. Both the minimum R-R and the mean R-R interval were related to the AVNERP (r = 0.946, r = 0.823, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In vitro, arrhythmias that result from triggered activity based on delayed afterdepolarizations can be reproducibly terminated by pacing. We studied the effect of similar pacing protocols on ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the intact canine heart. The experiments were performed in 17 conscious dogs that had surgically induced atrioventricular block. The pacing protocol included 1, 2, or 20 stimuli and also continuous stimulation during 15, 60, and 120 seconds with interstimulus intervals varying between 500 and 200 msec. A total of 331 stimulation trains were given. The cycle length of the ouabain-induced VT was compared before and after pacing. The mean R-R interval of the induced VT was 380 +/- 80 msec. Termination was only observed in 3% of the pacing experiments and was not reproducible. The common response to pacing was a shortening in cycle length of VT that resulted in R-R intervals of 300 +/- 50 msec (p less than or equal to 0.001). Acceleration was dependent on duration of stimulation. A decrease in the interstimulus interval resulted in shortening of both the first postpacing interval and the cycle length of VT after pacing. These concordant relations were independent of the pacing modes. In conclusion, pacing of ouabain-induced VT in the intact heart rarely results in termination of the arrhythmia. Acceleration of VT is the rule. This finding may be of help in differentiating triggered activity that results from delayed afterdepolarizations from other arrhythmogenic mechanisms.\r"

Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was significantly increased from preshock levels at the time of study and cardiac output was reduced. Plasma norepinephrine was significantly increased from control levels and was not altered by urapidil infusion. The mean arterial pressure fell in response to alpha 1-blockade from 111 to 85 mm Hg, the LVEDP fell from 16 to 9 mm Hg, and cardiac output increased from 2.90 to 3.70 L/min (all p less than 0.01). Regional blood flows measured by microsphere injection revealed an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscle, which had not been significantly decreased by the left ventricular dysfunction in this model, and further decreases in splanchnic flow, which was already depressed compared with that in normal dogs. Therefore acute alpha-adrenoceptor blockade improves central hemodynamics in experimental heart failure but does not normalize the resting blood flow maldistribution in this model.\r"

Doppler-determined regurgitant volume (DOPRV), Doppler-determined regurgitant fraction (DOPRF), total stoke volume, and forward stroke volume were calculated to compare the severity assessed by angiographic scoring and the regurgitant fraction determined by radionuclide angiography (RIRF). In 17 patients with MR, LVIV (84.4 +/- 20.4 ml) was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than LVOV (52.5 +/- 15.7 ml). LVOV, which is equivalent to forward stroke volume, was lower in patients with MR (52.2 +/- 15.7 ml) than in normal subjects (67.0 +/- 15.7 ml). In 15 patients with AR, LVOV (121.7 +/- 61.1 ml) was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than LVIV (75.1 +/- 28.1 ml) and LVOV, which is equivalent to total stroke volume, was greater in patients with AR (121.7 +/- 61.1 ml) than in normal subjects (64.0 +/- 14.4 ml). DOPRF correlated with RIRF (r = 0.79, p less than 0.01, n = 11). DOPRV (mild: 10.5 +/- 8.5 ml; moderate: 28.8 +/- 13.6 ml; severe: 74.5 +/- 36.7 ml) and DOPRF (mild: 13.7% +/- 11.5%; moderate: 33.1% +/- 14.2%; severe: 52.6% +/- 15.3%) increased markedly with the severity of regurgitation as assessed by cineangiography. In AR, total stroke volume influenced both forward stroke volume and regurgitant volume, and in MR, regurgitant volume influenced both total stroke volume and forward stroke volume. Total stroke volume in AR and regurgitant volume in MR may play a key role in valvular regurgitation.\r"

The influence of diabetes on cardiovascular disease was greatly dependent on these coexistent risk factors, but there was a substantial independent effect of glucose intolerance when all the standard risk factors had been taken into account. There was a rise in fibrinogen values throughout the range of blood sugar levels, which suggests a thrombogenic explanation for the unique diabetic effect. However, multivariate analysis indicates no further reduction in diabetic cardiovascular risk ratios after adjustment for fibrinogen; thus, there is a residual effect for glucose intolerance after all of the standard risk factors and fibrinogen have been taken into account.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular luminal changes were examined by percutaneous fiberoptic angioscopy in 13 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in four patients with acute myocarditis. Angioscope-guided endomyocardial biopsy was also performed in six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in two with acute myocarditis. A balloon-tipped guiding catheter (9F) was introduced through the right femoral artery into the left ventricle, the balloon was inflated, and a 1.6 or 4.3F fiberscope was introduced through the catheter into the ventricle so as to locate the fiberscope tip at the tip of the catheter shaft. The balloon was then pushed against the desired portion of the ventricle and warmed saline was infused to observe the luminal changes. In contrast to the patients without organic heart disease whose left ventricular luminal surface was brown in color, the luminal surface was white or light yellow in four, light brown in one, bluish-white in one, with white and brown portions distributed in a mosaic pattern in four, and it was reddish brown in the remaining one patient with dilated cardiomyopathy. Mural thrombi were observed in two of the patients. The luminal surface was light brown in one, reddish brown in one, rose in one, and red in one patient with acute myocarditis. Thrombi and scattered bleeding were observed in two and one of these patients, respectively. The changes in luminal coloration in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and acute myocarditis had no obvious relation to left ventricular volume and ejection fraction. Angioscope-guided biopsy revealed that the white and light yellow portions were due to endocardial fibrosis, that the endocardia of brown portions were not fibrotic, and that the myocardium in the red portions contained mononuclear cells, indicating inflammation. The results indicate that the angioscopic features of the left ventricular luminal surface were not uniform in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or in those with acute myocarditis, and that angioscopy can be used as a guiding tool for endomyocardial biopsy.\r"

Many of the techniques are noninvasive and can be performed in the cardiologist's office. These include treadmill exercise testing; radioisotope techniques, including ejection fraction studies, stress thallium scintigraphy, and tomographic imaging; and ambulatory monitoring. Other, newer techniques include provocative tests that induce ischemia in patients who cannot exercise. These new noninvasive tests should be used to detect transient ischemia, estimate its severity, and thus record a measure of the patient's risk for adverse coronary events.\r"

The pathophysiology and the mechanisms underlying these variations are the focus of much investigation. The effects of different drug treatments on these circadian rhythms are also being studied. This information should enable better treatment strategies to be planned for patients who have either silent or symptomatic episodes of transient myocardial ischemia and potentially to prevent the occurrence of sudden, catastrophic cardiac events.\r"

  ".W": "The role of pharmacologic interventions in acute myocardial infarction (i.e., a combination of intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous beta-blocker, oral aspirin, and intravenous thrombolysis), has become more standardized, whereas the role of mechanical intervention remains to be defined. Mechanical intervention includes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass grafting. The number of carefully controlled, randomized trials is limited, particularly with surgery. Nevertheless, in optimal circumstances, when performed within the first few hours of myocardial infarction, surgery can be beneficial in reducing mortality, especially with anterior location of infarct. Surgery may not prevent reinfarction. However, the results of nonrandomized surgical trials done 10 years ago are difficult to compare with modern-day treatment of myocardial infarction with the availability of new agents and PTCA. Angioplasty can be performed safely in the acute phase of myocardial infarction but may not be the ideal choice for all patients. The results may be more optimal if performed when the patient is stable. Clinical factors associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes have been identified. Mortality is not significantly affected by early versus late PTCA. Certain selected patients benefit from PTCA, particularly those in cardiogenic shock, in whom PTCA has made a dramatic improvement in outcome. To achieve maximal benefit, intervention should be performed early, within the first hours of symptoms. Further well-designed studies may help clarify the role mechanical techniques will play in future combinations of interventional therapy.\r"

To evaluate the effectiveness of a surveillance program of annual colonoscopy and mucosal sampling, 91 screened and 95 control ulcerative colitis patients with extensive disease for at least 8 yr were compared for differences in survival, cancer detection, and colectomy rates. The two groups were of similar age at symptom onset, duration of disease, and sex. In the surveillance group, there were eight fewer deaths (p less than 0.05 by survival-curve analysis), but two more cancer deaths (not significant). Colectomy was less common (p less than 0.05) and was performed 4 yr later in the surveillance group. The effect of surveillance was not confounded by age at symptom onset, sex, or duration of disease. In our program, screening for cancer in ulcerative colitis was associated with improved survival and delayed colectomy. However, improvement was not related to the anticipated benefits of improved cancer-related survival.\r"

Operative mortality (30 days) was associated with type of treatment (p less than 0.01), stage (p less than 0.05), and age (p less than 0.01) but not with site of cancer. Five-year survival curves excluding 30-day mortalities showed no significant difference between the two age groups. Proportional hazards linear model (multivariate) analysis showed that, whereas 5-yr survival was related to stage (p less than 0.001) and type of operation, patients greater than or equal to 80 did not have a significantly greater risk of death than patients less than 80 yr. Since the age of the patient influences operative morality, but not 5-yr survival, increasing attention needs to be paid to minimizing operative risk by careful preoperative assessment, optimization of underlying cardiac, pulmonary, and nutritional deficiencies, and monitoring numerous physiologic variables during the intraoperative and postoperative period. Resection of cancer should not be limited or denied on the basis of age alone.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine whether patients with endoscopically proven active peptic ulcer disease have a salivary deficiency of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), compared to patients with a normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Saliva was collected from fasting subjects prior to EGD. The levels of EGF were measured by radioimmunoassay. Statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variant followed by Student's t test. The concentrations of the peptide were lower in patients with active peptic ulcer disease (3.1 +/- 0.54 ng/ml, mean +/- SE, n = 25) compared with normal subjects (4.9 +/- 0.56 ng/ml, n = 58, p less than 0.03). No significant differences in salivary hEGF were noted between patients with a normal EGD and patients with gastritis (3.85 +/- .86 ng/ml, n = 13), esophagitis (4.5 +/- 1.3 ng/ml, n = 7), or Barrett's esophagus (5.3 +/- 1.5 ng/ml, n = 6). There were no differences in the salivary levels of hEGF between males and females, or between smokers and nonsmokers. There was no correlation of hEGF levels with age. The pathophysiologic significance of this finding is uncertain. Lower salivary hEGF may reduce one of the defensive mechanisms responsible for protecting the gastroduodenal mucosa from injury by physicochemical agents, thus contributing to ulcer development.\r"

In this study, we reviewed data deriving from 23 normal subjects, 69 asymptomatic duodenal ulcer patients treated with bedtime (52) or twice daily (17) doses of H2-antagonists, and 10 H2-receptor blocker nonresponders. The whole group underwent continuous 24-h acidity monitoring, and the arithmetic mean and median were calculated on each individual pH and pH antilog transformed profile. One-way analysis of variance and Kruskall-Wallis test were used for statistical comparison between the four subgroups studied. The greatest discrimination between them was obtained when using the mean of pHs [p(F) approximately 0, p[KW] = 2.10(-12)), instead of the median of pHs (p[F] = 8.10(-8), p[KW] = 7.10(-8)). The antilog transformation of pH did not improve the results. It can be concluded that the use of pH to express gastric acidity and the choice of the mean to summarize the drug-related profiles provides a better characterization of the acidity behavior than would the antilog transformation of pHs and the median.\r"

Chronic gastrointestinal problems were defined as recurring symptoms that were significant enough to alter lifestyle or require chronic treatment. Thirty-four (27%) of the patients had a significant chronic gastrointestinal problem. The limited manner through which SCI patients can manifest symptoms resulted in complaints which were characteristically quite vague. The most common problems that impaired quality of life were poorly localized abdominal pain (14%) and difficulty with bowel evacuation (20%). Hemorrhoids (74%), abdominal distention (43%), and autonomic hyperreflexia arising from the gastrointestinal tract (43%) were also very common, but had a lesser impact on lifestyle. Twenty-three percent of our population required at least one admission to the hospital for a gastrointestinal complaint following their injury. The prevalence of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms increased with time after injury, suggesting that these problems are acquired, and may therefore be avoided by the adoption of certain chronic care routines. Chronic gastrointestinal problems in SCI patients merit more study because they are: 1) very different from those in the general population, 2) responsible for a disproportionately great amount of morbidity in these patients, 3) potentially preventable.\r"

  ".W": "Retained common bile duct stones in postcholecystectomy patients who have a T-tube in situ should be treated, preferably, by nonoperative means. Thus, we treated seven such patients with common bile duct perfusion (through T-tube) of methyl tertiary butyl ether, and 10 patients with perfusion of monooctanoin. However, successful dissolution was achieved in only one and three patients, respectively. Hence, endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) was performed in the patients in whom solvent perfusion had failed, and in other subsequent patients with T-tube in situ. Of 28 patients thus treated, bile duct clearance could be achieved in 27 (96.5%) patients; minor bleeding occurred in only three patients. After sphincterotomy, the stones passed out spontaneously in 20 patients while the T-tube was still in situ, but in two patients, only after the T-tube was removed. Similarly, basketing of the stones could be done in four patients with the T-tube in position, but in one patient whose ductal stones were above the T-tube, the tube had to be removed to make basketing successful. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an efficient method of treating retained common bile duct stones in patients with T-tube in situ. However, in those patients whose ductal stones are above or astride the T-tube, the T-tube may have to be removed to attain bile duct clearance.\r"

Moreover, the outcome of variceal sclerotherapy, particularly its effect on conception, as well as its safety and efficacy when used during pregnancy, is not known. We have treated four patients of portal hypertension during pregnancy with sclerotherapy. Two of them presented to us before conception, were put on sclerotherapy for variceal bleed, and conceived while on sclerotherapy schedule. Two other patients were started on sclerotherapy during pregnancy when they presented with variceal bleed. Sclerotherapy with absolute alcohol was effective in control of variceal bleed as well as obliteration of varices in pregnant patients. There was no untoward effect on mother or fetus. The mean number of sessions and volume of alcohol required for variceal obliteration were 6.5 and 42.0 ml, respectively. Variceal sclerotherapy does not interfere with conception and successful pregnancy, and is safe as well as effective during pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive liver disease for which orthotopic liver transplantation is the only curative procedure. Questions exist regarding the role of temporizing procedures and the timing of transplantation. During the past 4 yr, we have performed liver transplants in 177 adult recipients. Twenty-six patients (14.6%) with primary sclerosing cholangitis received 30 transplants including 12 men and 14 women. The recipients were examined for a number of preoperative and postoperative variables. The 4-yr actuarial survival in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis after transplantation was 88%. Patients were segregated according to preoperative risk variables. Twenty patients were low and medium risk, with one death (95% survival). Three patients were high risk, with two deaths (33% survival). In conclusion, orthotopic liver transplantation is safe and effective therapy for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Early referral for transplantation is recommended to reduce the mortality associated with this procedure in those with advanced hepatic failure.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic binding protein (HBP) is a hepatic cell surface receptor specific for asialoglycoprotein. In vivo estimates of HBP concentration ([HBP]) were compared to classical indicators for hepatic functional reserve to clarify the validity of [HBP] in estimating the hepatic functional reserve in 30 humans. Estimates of [HBP] were obtained based on kinetic analysis of liver and blood time-activity data resulting from the hepatic clearance of a single injection of technetium-99m galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin, which is a synthetic analog radioligand specific to HBP. Estimates of [HBP] ranged 0.054 to 0.720 microM. Estimates of [HBP] in normal volunteers were 0.668 +/- 0.050 microM, whereas that in liver cirrhosis were 0.188 +/- 0.112 microM. The difference between the mean values of [HBP] estimates was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). Good correlations were observed between [HBP] and prothrombin time (r = 0.625, p = 0.0002), serum albumin level (r = 0.687, p = 0.0001), serum cholinesterase level (r = 0.764, p = 0.0001), indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (r = 0.602, p = 0.0024), and Child-Turcotte classification score (Pugh's modification) (r = -0.797, p = 0.0001). We concluded that excellent correlations of [HBP] with classical indicators for hepatic functional reserve suggest potential value of [HBP] as a sensitive measure of functioning hepatocyte mass.\r"

There have been few descriptions in the literature of what hiccups do to esophageal motility. We present a patient with long-standing symptomatic GER and intractable hiccups. Esophageal manometry during hiccups showed absence of LES pressure and absence of peristaltic activity in the esophageal body in response to swallowing, factors which could aggravate GER. Esophageal motility in the absence of hiccups was normal. Antireflux surgery in our patient relieved heartburn but not hiccups. Based on our case and a review of the literature, we believe that clinicians should be cautious in recommending antireflux surgery to treat hiccups in patients with both hiccups and heartburn.\r"

However, it rapidly increased in size, with doubling time subsequently calculated as 5 months. After 18 months' periodic observation, a gastrectomy was performed for a suspected malignancy. Histologic examination of the resected tumor revealed a leiomyosarcoma originating in the muscular layer of the stomach. It appears that the poor prognosis of leiomyosarcoma is related to its rapid growth; in addition, it is seldom detected at an early stage. Follow-up of the patient with a gastric submucosal tumor should be done first, 6 months after the initial examination, and thereafter, be done continuously according to the patient's condition. It is useful in differentiating a benign from a malignant myogenic tumor.\r"

Colonoscopy revealed diffuse hemorrhagic, erosive, aphtoid, and ulcerative lesions. Histology showed nonspecific inflammatory changes. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was isolated from endoscopic biopsy and stool specimens. The patient responded rapidly to symptomatic treatment with loperamide. This case demonstrates the potential for HSV-1 to induce infectious colitis; failure to obtain microbiologic evaluations and the rapid response to empiric, symptomatic treatment may be responsible for the rarity of diagnosis of this infection. The implications of this diagnosis are probably more relevant in immunosuppressed individuals, and may be important in the elderly population.\r"

The optimal dose schedule was 4 mg/kg body weight/day, injected ip for 10 consecutive days; lower doses produced only a short leishmanistatic effect. The optimal dose found was 50-fold lower than the LD50. In vitro studies using Leishmania-infected murine peritoneal macrophages showed sinefungin as a powerful inhibitory drug, mean ED50 for the several Leishmania isolates studied being 50 ng/ml.

Throughout South America, farmers diagnose cysticercosis by examining the tongues of their pigs for cysticercus nodules. Farmers do not bring pigs believed to be infected to the slaughterhouse for fear of confiscation. Therefore, reliable statistics on porcine cysticercosis can only be acquired at the household level. We examined the utility of the tongue test as a diagnostic tool for porcine cysticercosis. The results of the tongue test was compared with 2 serologic methods for the detection of cysticercosis, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot assay (EITB), and with necropsy results. We examined 11 animals from an endemic area (Huancayo) and 42 animals from an area free of cysticercosis (Lima). The tongue test has a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 100%, the EITB a sensitivity and specificity of 100%, and the ELISA a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 75%. Thus, the tongue examination, being a test essentially without cost and having fair sensitivity and high specificity, can be useful in epidemiological surveys. Prevalence for porcine cysticercosis in Huancayo is 23.4% by tongue examination, 31.2% by necropsy, 37.7% by ELISA, and 51.9% by EITB.\r"

The IgM response was more frequent in acute cases, and the mean titers of IgG- and IgM-specific antibodies were higher in the acute forms. By the fourth month of chemotherapy, there was a decay of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibody titers to this antigen in acute cases, correlating with clinical improvement. The detection of IgG and IgA antibodies and the sequential determination of antibodies to the 43 kDa glycoprotein may be useful tools for serodiagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.\r"

By the 15th PCK passage, this virus was less infectious for monkeys and resulted in a significantly reduced viremia as compared to the parent DEN-4 virus. The 30th PCK passage of DEN-4 341750 Carib was non-infectious for monkeys. A vaccine prepared at the 20th PCK passage in DBS-FRhL-2 cells stimulated the production of both neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition antibodies in monkeys; these animals were also protected against challenge with the homologous strain as well as a heterologous strain of DEN-4. An ID50 titration in monkeys resulted in a titer of greater than 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) for the vaccine virus and 0.5 PFU for the parent virus. Reduced monkey infectivity of this magnitude has been correlated with human attenuation in previous dengue vaccine candidates. The DEN-4 strain 341750 Carib PCK-20/FRhL-4 vaccine has been characterized and sufficiently tested to be considered for safety and immunogenicity trials in humans.\r"

Two recipients received 10(3) plaque forming units (PFU)/dose (1:100 dilution of stock vaccine). One remained asymptomatic, but became viremic between days 12 and 15, experienced a mild elevation of temperature (37.4 degrees C), and developed DEN-4 specific antibody. Neither recipient of the 10(4) PFU became infected. Eight volunteers then received undiluted vaccine (10(5) PFU). Viremia and antibody (neutralizing, hemagglutination inhibition, and IgM) developed in 5 of the 8 (63%). These 5 volunteers also developed a scarcely noticeable macular, blanching rash and minimal temperature elevations (37.3, 38.1, 37, 37.9, and 37.9 degrees C). Clinically insignificant decreases in total white blood cell, lymphocyte, and polymorphonuclear cell counts and an elevation in mononuclear cell counts occurred in association with viremia. This vaccine is safe, reasonably immunogenic, and suitable for further evaluation.\r"

In animals with no treatment, regenerative nodules remained unchanged during an eighteen-week observation period. Microangiograms showed markedly deranged intrahepatic microvasculatures, including an irregularly contoured vascular tree and rarefaction in the peripheral area. On the other hand, EB treatment exerted conspicuous efficacy on the above-mentioned intrahepatic microcirculatory disorder and on sinusoidal dilatation, which led the livers with MNLC to revert to almost normal appearance. It is concluded that EB provides a salutary effect on the intrahepatic microcirculatory system, by means of which MNLC can be shown to be a reversible lesion.\r"

The authors compared the results of dipyridamole-RNV with those of ergometer exercise-RNV in detecting myocardial ischemia. During exercise, ST depression, regional wall motion (RWM) abnormalities, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were observed in 21 (81%), 23 (88%), and 20 (77%) patients, respectively. However, after intravenous dipyridamole, ST depression, RWM abnormalities, and decreased LVEF were observed in 14 (54%), 15 (58%), and 2 (8%) patients, respectively. Although LVEF usually decreases during myocardial ischemia, LVEF did not decrease (57 +/- 11% to 58 +/- 10%), even in patients with ST depression, after intravenous dipyridamole. Maintained left ventricular ejection fraction is considered to be a hemodynamic effect of the potent arterial vasodilatation induced by dipyridamole. These results from dipyridamole-RNV in myocardial ischemia seem to conflict with the results from dipyridamole-thallium studies carried out to determine the capacity to detect coronary artery disease. Unknown mechanisms of dipyridamole other than the coronary steal phenomenon may be operative in the genesis of myocardial ischemia.\r"

All these patients had distal (ankle and foot edema) in the evening. After a first assessment these subjects were studied again after two weeks without treatment and after two weeks' treatment with total triterpenic fraction of centella asiatica (TTFCA), tablets, 60 mg, tid. The VSC produces a wheal on the skin of the perimalleolar region that disappears (in average) in less than sixty minutes in normal subjects. The disappearance time (DT) is greater in conditions of increased capillary filtration and permeability. The three groups of subjects (normal and those with superficial and severe venous hypertension) had significantly different, increasing disappearance time of the wheals at the first observation. There were no significant changes after two weeks' observation, but after 2 weeks' treatment with TTFCA, there was a significant decrease of DT both in limbs with superficial and with deep venous incompetence. The improvement (decrease) of the abnormally increased capillary permeability was associated with a significant improvement of the microcirculation and symptoms (studied by an analogue scale line). In conclusion this study showed a combined improvement of the microcirculation and capillary permeability after treatment with TTFCA and the possibility of using the VSC to evaluate the effects of drugs (or other treatment) on local capillary permeability in patients with venous hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hypertension on the regulation of limb circulation. The study group consisted of 50 patients suffering from hypertension; in 21 cases the peripheral circulation was intact, while 29 patients had peripheral obliterative arterial disease (POAD) (clinical symptoms: intermittent claudication or rest pain). The control group consisted of 67 normotensive patients. In 33 subjects of the control group the peripheral circulation was intact, while 34 patients suffered from POAD (clinical symptoms: intermittent claudication or rest pain). The total limb blood flow (LBF) was measured by using venous isotope dilution technique. In hypertensive patients the limb vascular resistance (LVR) was markedly elevated, but the LBF remained in the normal range. In patients suffering from both hypertension and POAD the LVR was pathologically elevated and the LBF markedly diminished. After acute vasodilator therapy the LBF significantly increased, despite the drop in blood pressure owing to the extensive decrease of the LVR. It appears that in hypertension the elevation of the LVR is the most characteristic change of the limb circulation. The elevation of the arterial blood pressure has no favorable effect on the limb circulation, and the LBF compared with the blood pressure is relatively low.\r"

Thickening in the arteries consisted of tightly packed smooth muscle cells and a few elastic fibers, whereas that in the veins was characterized by an abundance of collagen fibers, layers of smooth muscle cells, and a few elastic fibers.

The authors used the difference in mortality rate to infer whether thallium 201 myocardial perfusion scan abnormalities correspond to myocardial sarcoid by making the simplifying assumption that if they do, then patients with abnormal scans will be found to have a death rate similar to patients with sarcoid heart disease. The authors therefore analyzed complete survival data on 52 sarcoid patients without cardiac symptoms an average of eighty-nine months after they had been scanned as part of a protocol. By use of survival analysis (the Cox proportional hazards model), the only variable that was significantly associated with survival was age. The patients' scan pattern, treatment status, gender, and race were not significantly related to survival. The authors conclude that thallium myocardial perfusion scans cannot reliably be used to diagnose sarcoid heart disease in sarcoid patients without cardiac symptoms.\r"

They repeated one- or two-minute occlusions of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) in 8 conscious dogs. After 401 +/- 202 (SD) minutes of total LCCA occlusion time (35 +/- 19 days), The LCCA occlusion produced no sustained reduction in regional myocardial shortening and negligible reactive hyperemia. Upon reocclusion following a long-term reperfusion, the subendocardial segment shortening in the region at risk deteriorated markedly. At two minutes of occlusion, percent systolic shortening showed minimal values and thereafter gradually returned to the preocclusion resting levels within six to eight minutes of occlusion. In the presence of a resting heart rate similar to that at the time of functional recovery during the LCCA occlusion, long-term reperfusion did not modify the time course of regional functional response to the prolonged coronary occlusion. It is concluded that the newly developed collateral vessels still serve as significant blood-conveying conduits following a considerable period of reperfusion, and it requires approximately six to eight minutes to restore regional myocardial function in the collateral dependent zone following coronary reocclusion.\r"

In the pts with pretreatment Na+ less than 125 mmol/L, hypoNa was persistent and refractory to high-dose furosemide (less than 500 mg/day) and water restriction. Cardiovascular mortality of Group I pts was 69% within twenty-four months (34 pts died of low-output syndrom and 10 suddenly). All pts with Na+ less than 130 mmol/L died within six months. The 20 pts who normalized Na+ are alive, and in NYHA class II-III (follow-up: twenty-six +/- fifteen, six to sixty months). Pts without hypoNa were 97/161 (Group II), and 58/97 (60%) are alive (follow-up: thirty +/- eighteen, five to fifty-eight months), whereas 39 pts died (27 suddenly, 9 of low-output syndrome, and 3 of extracardiac disease) within twenty-four months. The mortality rate of Group II was significantly lower (40% vs 69%, p less than 0.001) compared with Group I. The two groups were similar for age, sex, and cause and duration of SCHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The charts of 100 blunt trauma patients who were admitted to the ICU, underwent surgery, or died in the emergency department were reviewed for compliance with six explicit process-of-care criteria previously established by the ED faculty. The results of this explicit review were compared with the results of an ongoing quality assurance program that uses implicit review. In the implicit review, a faculty member reviewed patients' charts and responded to three questions regarding the process of care. All blunt trauma patients who met the admission criteria were to be included in this review. Only 44 of the 100 charts were subjected to implicit review. Of these, 26 were judged satisfactory by both methods, two were judged unsatisfactory by both methods, two failed only the implicit review, and 14 failed only the explicit review. The null hypothesis, that the two methods were equivalent, was rejected (McNemar's test, P less than .003). These results suggest that process-of-care assessments of the quality of care must be interpreted with caution as they are method dependent and may not correlate with patient outcomes.\r"

It is expected that a combination of bedside teaching and didactic sessions will cover all aspects of the curriculum, but this has not been demonstrated. This study describes a method of using the distribution of clinical cases to shape the mix of clinical and didactic learning in an emergency medicine clerkship. All senior students at the Albany Medical College participate in a four-week emergency medicine rotation. A brief log describing each clinical encounter is maintained by the students. Data from one year were sorted into 32 categories adapted from American College of Emergency Physicians guidelines and were tabulated. A criterion of 80% of students encountering at least one case in each category was chosen to ensure a reasonable level of exposure to a particular case or topic. One hundred twenty-three students were exposed to an average of 63.7 +/- 27.5 (SD) patients. Seven categories met the criterion, and the remaining 25 categories failed the criterion. Results indicate that exposure to certain categories of patients with appropriate monitoring can be reasonably ensured in our clinical setting. The didactic portion of the curriculum can be adjusted so that categories not meeting the clinical criterion will be emphasized, whereas those meeting the criterion will be de-emphasized. A method has been described that identifies gaps in the clinical exposure of students and permits appropriate identification of didactic sessions to create a clerkship more consistent with recommended guidelines.\r"

An additional 60 patients (12%) returned with new problems unrelated to their initial presentation. Physician-related factors were the primary reason for return in 92 cases (18%). Problems with our public health-care system prompted return in 18 cases (4%). Eighty-seven returning patients (19%) required emergency hospitalization, including 28 discharged due to physician errors. Regular case review of short-term returns to the ED should be included in a comprehensive ED-based program of quality assurance.\r"

To test the hypothesis that effective community AIDS education can be based in an emergency department, we designed and evaluated two educational interventions in a high-volume urban ED. A pretest/post-test design was used in which subjects were assigned to receive either an active education program, a passive education program, or no education program. Knowledge gains and self-reported risk-reduction behavior were evaluated by follow-up testing within a five-week period. The active and passive groups had significantly greater knowledge gains than the control group (P less than .001). Significantly greater reported reductions in high-risk behavior were found in both the active and passive groups compared with the control group (P less than .01). This study demonstrates that an ED-based AIDS education program can have a significant impact on improving knowledge and reducing self-reported risk behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "Although we commonly assume that because residents spend a given number of months in the emergency department they achieve adequate exposure to all necessary clinical entities, this has never been shown. We suspect, rather, that great variability exists among residents in the number and variety of patients they see; and that with respect to the ED, there are important diagnoses that are rare or absent in the clinical pathology of a training program. To confirm these hypotheses, we implemented a computerized system of recording patients and diagnoses managed in the ED by the 33 residents of the University of Illinois Affiliated Hospitals Emergency Medicine Residency. We collected data for nine months and accumulated 2,152 shifts of clinical experience. These data confirm our hypotheses. We found that senior residents managed an average of 11.9 +/- 2.3 patients per ten-hour shift, but the quickest resident saw almost twice as many patients as the slowest. Junior residents saw fewer patients, 8.5 +/- 1.4 patients per shift, but maintained a twofold difference between the fastest and slowest. Furthermore, there are important diagnoses that present too rarely for each resident to become facile in their management. We found that 22.7% of the 554 diagnoses listed in the Emergency Medicine Core Content never once presented to the ED. An additional 34.7% of these diagnoses did present, but so rarely that each resident could not possibly manage one case during a residency. The Length of Training Report of the American College of Emergency Physicians provides objective guidelines for the number of encounters a resident should have with 283 clinical entities. In this study, residents fell short of these guidelines with 50.5% of diagnoses. While absolute quantity of exposure does not assure competence in management, we recommend that each residency monitor the experience of its residents. This allows a residency to change its curriculum to make optimum use of available pathology, as well as to supplement deficiencies in clinical experience with case simulations.\r"

We discuss how ACEP arrived at this position and the role of academic emergency medicine in addressing this shortage. For many years, there has been a public debate as to whether there is a physician shortage or surplus. The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Commission report of 1980 estimated that there would be 630,000 US physicians by 1990, with a surplus of 70,000. This report also identified emergency medicine as a shortage specialty, indicating there would be a need for 14,000 emergency physicians in 1990, with a supply of only 8,000. Schwartz included such factors as increased provision of administrative and research activity by physicians and concluded that there would be a shortage of 7,000 physicians by the year 2,000.\r"

The t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are examples of parametric tests of significance. Assumptions regarding the data to be analyzed when using the t-test or ANOVA include normality of the populations from which the sample data are drawn, homogeneity of the variances of the populations from which the sample data are drawn, and independence of the data points within a sample group. The t-test is the appropriate test of significance to use if there are only two groups to compare. If there are three or more groups to compare, ANOVA is the appropriate test. ANOVA holds the preset alpha level constant. While ANOVA will imply a significant difference between the groups compared, a multiple comparison test will define which of the three or more groups differ significantly.\r"

The follow-up of tuberculin skin test status among staff with exposure to this millieu was observed in hope of delineating whether a significant problem does exist. A questionnaire survey of tuberculin skin test status of graduating pulmonary fellows was performed. Graduating Infectious Disease Fellows formed the control group. Training programs situated in the top 25 cities for tuberculosis in 1983 were chosen if the Fellows spent a major proportion of their time in a large receiving/public hospital. The data returned were analyzed if the individual programs had both Pulmonary and Infectious Disease Fellows in training. Fourteen training programs supplied usable data over a 3-yr period. Seven of 62 (11%) of Pulmonary Fellows at risk converted their tuberculin skin test as opposed to one of 42 (2.4%) of Infectious Disease Fellows. This observation raises concern that more fastidious precautions are needed to isolate patients under these conditions of respiratory aerosol generation. The available armamentarium of nonrecirculated fresh air ventilation and ultraviolet light irradiation in addition to simply wearing face masks should be increasingly utilized. Further studies are warranted to substantiate the applicability of these measures to the current situation.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the cytotoxic events taking place in the lung of patients with HIV-1 infection, we studied the cells recovered from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of nine patients with AIDS, seven patients with AIDS-related complex, and two patients with lymphadenopathy. Phenotypic analysis was coupled to a series of functional evaluations of nonspecific cytotoxic abilities performed on lung effectors, including their property to bind K-562 targets, to release natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF), and to become cytotoxic following in vitro activation with rIL-2. Our results demonstrated that lung cells bearing the NK-related CD16, CD56, and CD57 antigens were quantitatively increased, irrespective of the disease stage. The majority of the cells also coexpressed the CD3 molecule and the alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR), notably the phenotype characterizing MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic T cells. From a functional point of view, a severe impairment of the spontaneous cytotoxic ability was demonstrated in most patients. Evaluation at the single cell level showed a normal percentage of the effector/target conjugates formed by HIV-1 lymphocytes. The release of NKCF was undetectable in patients with AIDS even following lectin stimulation, whereas BAL cells from patients with earlier infection produced and/or could be triggered to release discrete amounts of NKCF by incubation with PHA. Studies designed to activate lung cytotoxic cells with rIL-2 showed that in most patients the stimulation of effector cells with rIL-2 enhanced the spontaneous killing and elicited a lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The reliability and reproducibility of this measurement in mechanically ventilated patients is not certain. In 14 stable, mechanically ventilated patients, capable of spontaneous inspiratory efforts, we assessed maximal inspiratory efforts using the technique originally described by Marini and associates. MIP was measured in triplicate, by one to five experienced investigators, on one to seven successive days, for a total of 396 determinations on 54 patient days. The coefficients of variation among the triplicate efforts averaged 12 +/- 1%, indicating the test to be highly reproducible. There was significant variation among the MIP reported by different investigators studying the same patient on the same day (32 +/- 4%). The differences between best MIP by different investigators averaged 12.6 +/- 1.3cm H2O (40 +/- 4%). In 17 of 44 cases, one investigator placed MIP above -30cm H2O, whereas another placed it below. ANOVA showed that MIP was significantly affected by investigator (p less than 0.0001) as well as by patient (p less than 0.0001). Because \"true\" MIP must be equal to or greater than the best measured MIP, these data indicate that the MIP is commonly underestimated in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, even when standardized technique is used. Furthermore, our data show that reproducibility of triplicate MIP determination by a single observer does not indicate that the test is reliable.\r"

  ".W": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep. Inspiratory muscles may be subjected to potentially fatiguing loads during an obstructive apnea and this may be related to the termination of obstructive apnea. We have measured transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) and breathing patterns in six male patients with OSA during sleep to characterize respiratory muscle function in OSA and determine whether apnea termination is consistently related to a pressure time index of the diaphragm (PTI) associated with respiratory muscle fatigue. There was a large intersubject variability in Pdi generation during apnea. No consistent level of PTI was associated with apnea termination. During prolonged apneas, the respiratory duty cycle plateaued, which is suggestive of an inhibitory reflex possibly mediated by chest wall afferents. There were intersubject differences in both inspiratory and expiratory muscle recruitment during apnea. In the majority of patients, the diaphragm appeared to be the primary inspiratory muscle during apnea, but in some it appeared to be the intercostal/accessory muscles. The majority of patients demonstrated an increase in gastric pressure and inward abdominal movement during the expiratory phases of an apnea, consistent with abdominal muscle recruitment stimulated by increased ventilatory drive.\r"

Using a noncalibrated respiratory inductance plethysmograph (RIP), we quantitated the rib cage (RC) to abdominal (AB) asynchrony and the lag phase in chest wall expansion by the phase angle from the RC versus AB signal curve. Phase angles were obtained in 17 children aged 1 to 50 months with acute UAO and 30 normal control subjects. The phase angle in UAO (16 to 165 degrees; mean = 83.6 degrees) was significantly higher than in control subjects (3 to 25 degrees; mean = 11.5 degrees), p less than 0.001. Following 29 episodes of inhalation treatment with 0.03 ml/kg of racemic epinephrine, the phase angle in the UAO group decreased to 7 to 160 degrees (mean = 38.3; p = 0.001) as the shape of the RC versus AB loop became narrower. In response to the treatment, the clinical severity of UAO decreased and the tidal breathing flow-volume loop improved. A high association was observed between the phase angle and the degree of stridor (p less than 0.005 Fisher's exact test), and in 90% (26 of 29) the changes in the phase angle and in the degree of stridor were in agreement. We conclude that the RC-AB asynchrony in acute UAO can be objectively quantitated by phase-angle measurement from a noncalibrated RIP and is thus suitable for use in infants and small children. The phase angle may be used to assess objectively the response of UAO to therapy.\r"

The data were compared with those from seven healthy nonsmoking control subjects matched for physical characteristics and studied under the same experimental conditions; the control subjects were drawn from a data bank of healthy subjects and were matched to the patients for age, sex, and the initial distribution of their radioaerosol deposition. Pulmonary function indices (FEV1, FVC, PEFR, and MMFR25-75) for the patients were all significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced compared with those for the control subjects. The initial topographic distribution of the radioaerosol within the lungs of the patients and control groups was similar: alveolar deposition [mean (SD)] was 36.4 (6.7) versus 41.0 (4.0)%, and penetration index was 0.56 (0.08) versus 0.56 (0.03), respectively. Tracheobronchial clearance of deposited radioaerosol over a 6-h observation period after inhalation showed a marked reduction (p less than 0.02) in the patients: area under the clearance curve (between zero and 6 h) was 262 (80)% h for the patients and 142 (41)% h for the healthy control subjects. These data suggest that in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic weakness, mucociliary clearance is depressed, or that reduced mechanical movement of the lungs can itself impair clearance of secretions from the lungs. Impaired clearance from either cause may contribute to an increased incidence of chest infections in severe respiratory muscle weakness.\r"

For children 6 months to 11 yr of age, the unadjusted prevalence for asthma was 3.0% among white children and 7.2% among blacks; prevalence of frequent wheeze was 6.2% among whites and 9.3% among blacks. In a logistic regression model including race, age, and sex, the relative odds (RO) of asthma for black children as compared to white children were 2.5 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.9 to 3.4). Other predictors of asthma in a stepwise logistic regression included age, sex (boys versus girls, RO = 1.4), younger maternal age (2 standard deviation [SD] drop in age, RO = 1.4), residence in the central city (RO = 1.6), and family income (RO for the lowest versus highest tertile, RO = 1.7). After adjusting for these risk factors, age and sex, black children still had a 1.7 RO (95% Cl, 1.2 to 2.1) of having asthma. Frequent wheeze was associated with race (black versus white, RO = 1.6), sex (boys versus girls, RO = 1.3), birth weight (2 SD deficit in birth weight, RO = 1.4), and triceps skinfold thickness (increase in odds of asthma for 2 SD increase in skinfold, RO = 1.6). The significant effect of maternal age and birth weight after adjusting for other confounding variables suggests that the in utero environment may be an important determinant of asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the mechanism by which inflammation leads to obstruction has not been elucidated. We performed morphometry to determine if the airways of patients with obstruction were thicker than normal. Sixty smokers were selected from those undergoing resectional lung surgery. They were grouped according to their FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1% control = 77%, FEV1 obstructed = 55%) and matched for age, sex, and height. Wall area (mm2), perimeter (mm), and diameter (mm) were measured by a modification of the technique of James and coworkers (7). The relaxed luminal diameter (mm) and wall thickness (mm) were calculated from these values. A pathology score for inflammation and fibrosis was assigned to each patient, and the percentage of the wall made up of muscle, epithelium, and connective tissue was determined by point counting. Two hundred airways, 90% of which were membranous bronchioles, were measured in each group. The mean-measured luminal diameter in the controls was 0.81 mm and in the obstructed patients 0.70 mm (p less than or equal to 0.05). The regression lines relating wall thickness to calculated luminal diameter showed that the airways of the obstructed patients were thicker throughout the size range measured (p less than or equal to 0.005). The muscle, epithelium, and connective tissue were all increased in the obstructed patients (p less than or equal to 0.001). In addition, the wall thickness correlated with the pathology score (r = 0.6074, p less than or equal to 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We also investigated whether BUD started 20 to 24 h after the development of a late asthmatic reaction (LAR) would influence the antigen-induced increase in nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness to BHR-H. Thirty-one children with mild asthma who were atopic to HDM were randomized double blind into two parallel groups. Fifteen patients inhaled 0.2 mg BUD three times a day. Sixteen inhaled placebo in a similar way. Treatment began 20 to 24 h after antigen exposure and continued for 2 months. BHR-H and BHR-HDM were measured prior to and at the end of treatment. BHR-H was also determined 3 days after each antigen provocation. In the children receiving BUD, mean BHR-H and mean BHR-HDM were decreased approximately twofold after 2 months. No increase in BHR-H was observed after 3 days in the BUD group, irrespective of whether a LAR occurred. In patients in whom BUD treatment was withheld after the second antigen provocation, the protective effect of BHR-H was abolished. We conclude that 2 months of treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid causes a decrease in BHR-H and BHR-HDM. When an inhaled corticosteroid is administered 20 to 24 h after antigen provocation, It may protect against the antigen-induced increase in BHR-H. After treatment is discontinued, the protective effect wears off rapidly.\r"

Linear regression models that included indicator variables for self-reported exposure explained 9 and 6% of the variability of the respirable particle and the nicotine concentrations, respectively. The individual mean urinary cotinine levels standardized to creatinine concentration ranged from 3.9 to 55.8 ng/mg Cr, and for salivary cotinine the mean levels ranged from 0.9 to 4.3 ng/ml. Indicator variables for self-reported exposure explained 8 and 23% of the variability of the urinary and salivary cotinine levels, respectively.

The test was performed using a computerized system, which also made the calculations. About one out of five healthy subjects in this population were unable to satisfactorily perform the test; the failure rate was the same for the two sexes (20% in boys, 21.5% in girls) and significantly higher in younger children (26.6 and 14.5% for children under and over the age of 13, respectively; p = 0.03). The distribution of results was skewed for PIII and practically normal for log PIII, CV, VC, and CV/VC or CC/TLC ratios. PIII was highly significantly, inversely related to anthropometric variables; the highest coefficient was that for the age-weight interaction term in boys (= r -0.57 for PIII, -0.62 for log PIII) and for weight in girls (r = -0.57 for both PIII and log PIII). Because the anthropometric variables were strongly interrelated (r between 0.45 and 0.79), multiple regressions did not materially improve the prediction of PIII. In simple regression, weight alone explained 36% of the variability of log PIII in boys and 32% in girls. The mean PIII was significantly higher in girls as compared to boys (1.14 +/- 0.38 versus 0.98 +/- 0.17% N2/L, p = 0.02); CV and CC in milliliters were related to body build as other lung volumes; the CV/VC in girls and CC/TLC ratio in both sexes were not related to anthropometric variables. In boys, CV/VC decreased significantly with height (p = 0.035 for CV/VC versus height3).\r"

Rats born in a hypoxic environment were kept in hypoxia for an additional week after birth. The rats were then raised in atmospheric air, and when adult, they were compared with the rats born and raised in air. Rats (10 wk old) of both groups were exposed to 10% O2 for 2 wk. They were then studied immediately after the exposure and after 2 wk of recovery from the sojourn in the hypoxic environment. The experience of perinatal hypoxia did not affect mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure, right ventricle weight, or the number of muscularized peripheral pulmonary vessels. During exposure to chronic hypoxia in adulthood, both groups developed pulmonary hypertension, which was not affected by previous perinatal hypoxia. The pulmonary vascular responses to acute hypoxic challenges were studied in the preparation of isolated perfused lungs. In both groups of rats, perinatally hypoxic and normoxic, the acute hypoxic vasoconstriction was attenuated immediately after the exposure of adult animals to chronic hypoxia. However, during the recovery from this hypoxic sojourn, the rats born in hypoxia were significantly more reactive to acute lung hypoxia than all other groups of rats studied. It is concluded that the experience of a short period of perinatal hypoxia did not affect the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension induced in adulthood. It increased, however, the pulmonary vascular reactivity to acute hypoxic stimuli during the period of recovery from a sojourn in the hypoxic environment in adulthood.\r"

We also determined the effects of emphysema, chronic Ca2+ channel blocker treatment, and acute hypoxia on the distribution of vascular resistance in isolated left lower lobes. Pulmonary vascular resistance was increased (4 +/- 1 mm Hg/L/min) in the animals studied 6 months after receiving 4 weekly treatments with papain compared with control animals (2.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/L/min, p less than 0.05), and this effect of emphysema was blunted with chronic nitrendipine, 3 mg/kg twice a day (3.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg/L/min). Both at baseline and at 6 months, hypoxia-induced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance were abolished by nitrendipine. The total pulmonary pressure gradient (delta Pt) was partitioned into pressure gradients across arterial (delta Pa), middle (delta Pm), and venous (delta Pv) vessels by occlusions performed during normoxia (PIO2 = 200 mm Hg) and hypoxia (PIO2 = 30 mm Hg). Papain-treated animals had elevated delta Pt compared with that in control animals because of an increased delta Pv (9.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg versus 5.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg in control animals, p less than 0.05). In contrast, only delta Pm was increased with papain + nitrendipine (2.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg versus 0.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in control animals, p less than 0.05). An increase in the downstream pressure gradient was also observed when lobes from animals with emphysema were studied under conditions of reverse perfusion. Hypoxic responses were similar in the control and papain groups, with increases in delta Pa and delta Pm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A group of 12 clinically stable patients with interstitial lung disease was studied. Patients with a history of weight loss had significantly more severe lung volume restriction. Regression analysis showed that 42% of body weight variation was explained by vital capacity (p less than 0.025). Resting energy expenditure was measured by standard methods of indirect calorimetry. The measurements were performed with a ventilated hood during prolonged steady-state periods after an overnight fast. We found that resting energy expenditure was increased to 117.3 and 118.7% of the predicted basal metabolic rate, according to Fleisch and to Harris and Benedict reference values, respectively (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, resting energy expenditure was increased to 120.8% of the predicted value according to body fat-free mass (p less than 0.001). This extra energy expenditure in patients with interstitial lung disease is similar to that recently reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

Forty-eight (48) patients were found to have 5% or more BAL eosinophils. The most common causes for increased BAL eosinophils were interstitial lung diseases (40% of patients), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated pneumonia (17% of patients), idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia (15% of patients), and drug-induced lung disease (12% of patients). Together, these four diagnoses accounted for 84% of all patients. In contrast, eosinophils were uncommon in the BAL of patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, community-acquired pneumonia, or immunocompromising diseases other than AIDS. The finding of increased BAL eosinophils was most helpful in patients presenting with unexplained pulmonary infiltrates. In these patients, this finding was often an important clue to the final diagnosis. We conclude that although the finding of an increased percentage of BAL eosinophils is uncommon, when present it is relatively specific for a limited number of diseases.\r"

We studied the effect of SO2 on pulmonary macrophage endocytosis in resting and in exercising animals by measuring the rates of macrophage endocytosis in situ for 1 h of a test particle of insoluble radioactive colloidal gold (198Au), 1, 24, or 48 h after inhalation exposure to SO2. Resting hamsters exposed for 4 h to 50 ppm SO2 had no significant reduction in macrophage endocytosis compared with air-breathing control hamsters. However, if hamsters were exposed to the same concentration of SO2 while continuously running (40 min at 0.9 km/h), macrophage endocytosis was significantly reduced 1 h after exposure even though the exposure time was only one-sixth as long. Twenty-four hours later, the percentage of gold ingested by pulmonary macrophages remained significantly depressed. By 48 h, the rate had returned to control values. Exercise alone did not affect endocytosis. Hamsters exposed to 50 ppm SO2, with or without exercise, also showed significant reductions in the number of lavaged macrophages. This decrease was greatest and most persistent in the SO2 plus exercise group. These data indicate that even when animals are exposed to water-soluble gases, which are normally removed by the upper airways, exercise can potentiate damage to more peripheral components of the pulmonary defense system such as the macrophage.\r"

  ".W": "Little is known about the functions of alveolar macrophages during the later resolving phases of pulmonary inflammation. We have used an animal model of resolving pulmonary inflammation to obtain inflammatory macrophages (IMs) and have compared several IM functions with those of resident macrophages (RMs). IMs were frequently peroxidase positive and contained large amounts of myeloperoxidase activity. IMs also contained significant amounts of a serine protease type of elastase. The procoagulant activity of IMs was less than that of RMs, and IMs exhibited increased plasminogen activator activity when incubated on fibrin matrices. IMs also degraded fibrin directly, without plasminogen, and this activity was due to two different enzymes of molecular weights 39 and 63 kD that were present in IM granules and plasma membranes. These results suggest that, in vivo, IMs take up PMN enzymes and alter their procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity to maximize fibrin removal. These IM functions may be important for successful resolution of inflammatory injury.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the respiratory epithelium of 13 infertile patients with flagellar ultrastructural anomalies whether they suffered or not from respiratory disease. Only one patient had severe respiratory disease. The beat frequency of nasal cilia (9 to 13 Hz) was considered normal in 11 of the 13 patients. All the cilia were found abnormal in one patient. In 12 of 13 infertile men (92.3%), significant ultrastructural cilia anomalies were found (greater than 7%) even though the men did not suffer from any respiratory disease. Axonemal anomalies were found at both levels either of the same type (four cases) or only partially similar (two cases) or totally different (six cases). The most frequently abnormal substructure of cilia was the central complex (10 of 12) even in cases exhibiting a different abnormal pattern at the flagellar level. Findings are discussed according to those found in animal mutants. Our results suggest that ciliary and flagellar axonemes should be controlled both by common and by different groups of genes.\r"

Abnormal epithelial cells can also be recovered from patients with interstitial lung diseases who do not have cancer, and therefore the usefulness of lavage in the diagnosis of malignancy in this setting is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic significance of abnormal lavage cells recovered from patients with diffuse parenchymal abnormalities and compared the usefulness of standard cytologic assessment, correlation with clinical features, and immunocytochemical staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in identifying abnormal cells that are truly malignant. Thirty of 2,314 patients had atypical lavage cells, but in only nine was lung cancer demonstrated. Although most patients with clinical suspicion of malignancy had lung carcinoma (six of seven), one such patient did not have cancer, and three were shown to have unsuspected carcinoma. Cytologic criteria identified definitely malignant cells in only four of nine patients with lung cancer, indicating that the approach is not sensitive. Immunostaining of abnormal cells with anti-CEA antibodies proved helpful. All patients with lung malignancy had CEA+ cells (n = 9), and no patient whose abnormal cells were CEA- proved to have cancer (n = 17). Because only nine of 13 patients with CEA+ cells had lung malignancy, the test is not diagnostic, but it appears to limit the need for further evaluation to a smaller group of patients in whom cancer is likely to be present. When used together, cytopathologic findings, detection of CEA by immunocytochemical techniques, and clinical correlates proved useful in diagnosis of lung malignancy, but further improvements are still needed to improve diagnostic accuracy.\r"

We determined the distribution of bronchiolar lesions and correlated inflammation with virions and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology. Nineteen beagle puppies were inoculated with tissue culture fluid (control puppies, n = 8), or CAV2 (CAV2, n = 11). The puppies had clinical assessments and measurements of lung resistance (RL), and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) immediately before inoculation (Day zero) and 3 days later (Day 3). The puppies were killed on Day 3, the lungs were removed, and the right intermediate lobe was lavaged. The BALF was assessed for total and differential cell counts. Bronchiolar inflammation was quantitated by bronchiolar inflammation scores (BIS). CAV2 was localized by immunofluorescent antibody staining and electron microscopy. The control puppies remained healthy. The CAV2 puppies had positive cultures for CAV2, respiratory symptoms, and generalized necrotizing bronchiolitis. Alveolar inflammation was quantitatively less prominent than bronchiolar inflammation, and RL and Cdyn were unchanged. The BALF neutrophilia correlated with the BIS. CAV2 was present within bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar epithelial type 2 cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. CAV2 was not found in airways smooth muscles or nerves, nor in any noninflamed tissues of CAV2 puppies or in control animals. Our data suggest that acute CAV2 in beagle puppies produces an inflammation of most bronchioles. Intracellular CAV2 was found in bronchiolar epithelium, macrophages, neutrophils, and alveolar epithelial type 2 cells. Bronchiolar inflammation was reflected in BALF cytology. We conclude that bronchiolar inflammation as indicated by BIS and BALF cytology is related temporarily to histamine hyperresponsiveness in our beagle puppies.\r"

On review of our files over the past 12 years, we found six cases of xanthogranulomatous endometritis, all associated with endometrial adenocarcinoma that had been irradiated by external beam and/or intracavitary implants prior to surgery. Histologically, these cases were characterized by foamy histiocytes with variable amounts of associated multinucleated giant cells, other chronic inflammatory cells, necrosis, calcium, cholesterol clefts, and hemosiderin. Xanthogranulomatous features were not present in the pretreatment endometrial biopsy specimens from any of the six patients. Contributory factors to the development of xanthogranulomatous endometritis such as necrosis, hemorrhage, obstruction, tumor bulk, or delay in treatment were identified. The mechanism of development of xanthogranulomatous endometritis may involve a complex interaction of elements common to the development of xanthogranulomatous change in other organs (obstruction, inflammation, and a lipid source) as well as elements unique to irradiated tissue (generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation). These cases indicate that radiation injury in the setting of endometrial adenocarcinoma is an additional etiopathologic finding ofulomatous endometritis.\r"

An ongoing study of the hearts of people aged 80 years and older is being conducted at our institution. Various aspects of morphologic changes in these hearts were studied. In this report, we discuss the presence and extent of myocardial fibrosis, namely, the interstitial type. Two types of fibrosis are recognized: (1) scarring, the fibrotic replacement of lost myocardium, usually of vascular origin; and (2) interstitial, in which a delicate fibrotic net encircles single myocardial fibers. The morphologic findings were correlated with the following clinical findings: hypertension, congestive heart failure, emphysema, cor pulmonale, and coronary artery disease. The results support the hypothesis that interstitial fibrosis develops independently of the above-mentioned clinical conditions and may be considered as a true aging process.\r"

Flow cytometric S fractions greater than 0.05 were associated with poor clinical outcome. There was no correlation between tumor ploidy and clinical outcome.

  ".W": "Aggregates of microtubules with-in rough endoplasmic reticulum were found in many neoplastic cells of three cases of myxopapillary ependymoma of the filum terminale studied ultrastructurally. The cytoplasm and cellular processes of some neoplastic cells were distended by the aggregates. In general the involved rough endoplasmic reticulum contained three to six microtubules, but some enclosed more than 10 microtubules. The enclosed microtubules were straight parallel hollow cylindrical structures with fuzzy coats. They had an inner diameter of 12 to 15 nm, an outer diameter of 30 to 35 nm, and a center-to-center distance of 50 to 62 nm. The involved rough endoplasmic reticulum often showed various degrees of loss of surface ribosomes and some appeared totally degranulated. Vacuolar degeneration of involved rough endoplasmic reticulum with fragmentation and disintegration of the enclosed microtubules was frequent. Direct relationship of the enclosed microtubules to the cytoplasmic microtubules and ciliary formation was not found. This unusual microtubular aggregate has not been described in other types of ependymoma, or in other brain tumors. They may represent a characteristic ultrastructural feature of myxopapillary ependymoma.\r"

  ".W": "We have performed a statistical study of 1218 autopsies of neonates to extract the factors related to fatal neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Prematurity indicated by a short gestational period or a low birth weight was the most significant factor for IVH. Many other factors considered to be related to IVH were also related closely to prematurity. Therefore, we pose the following question throughout the study: Did the factors independently relate to IVH without any confounding effects of prematurity? To obtain the answer, we tried a statistical adjustment for gestational age to eliminate the confounding effects of prematurity. After the adjustment was made, we concluded that the following 10 items, in order, were the actual factors related to fatal IVH: prematurity, subependymal hemorrhage, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, hyaline membrane disease, respiratory acidosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, cyanosis, respirator care, and low Apgar score. There were two distinctive categories in the factors that were eliminated by the adjustment. One was a group that has no significance whatsoever in any subdivided gestational groups, such as meconium aspiration syndrome, due to purely the result of the confounding effect. The other was a group that showed its statistical significance only in a certain period of gestation, such as breech presentation.\r"

There have been conflicting reports with regard to the influence of methotrexate (MTX) on serum RF levels in RA. We determined IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels in paired serum samples (obtained at study entry and completion) from RA patients enrolled in multicenter trials with the Cooperative Systematic Studies of Rheumatic Diseases program. After exclusion of the 14 IgM-RF-negative sera, there were samples from 30 MTX-treated patients and 52 placebo-treated patients. Changes in IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels were weakly associated with each other. Significant decreases in IgM-RF levels were observed in the MTX-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. These changes were most significant in the MTX-treated patients who improved clinically. There were significant decreases in IgA-RF levels at study completion among MTX-treated patients who had improved clinically and those who had not improved clinically, but not in the placebo group. The contributions of clinical improvement and MTX treatment to changes in serum IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels were examined using a logistic regression model. Changes in IgM-RF were strongly related to MTX treatment and, to a lesser extent, to clinical improvement; changes in IgA-RF were related only to MTX treatment. These results indicate that MTX treatment per se decreases both IgM-RF and IgA-RF levels, whereas clinical improvement correlates with decreased IgM-RF levels only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The immunohistology of the synovium-cartilage junction was studied in 8 normal human knees, using monoclonal antibodies. In all joints at the junction with synovium, a vascular, wedge-shaped tongue of tissue was found to cover the cartilage surface. This marginal tissue overlying cartilage was in continuity with and was immunohistochemically similar to the adjacent synovial tissue, and contained cells possessing class II HLA antigens and antigens present on macrophages and type B synoviocytes. Periosteal tissue adjacent to the synovium-cartilage junction contained not only macrophages and other class II-positive cells, but also cells and matrix that stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for articular cartilage (keratan sulfate and type II collagen). This study demonstrates the presence of immunocompetent cells in tissue overlying the cartilage surface and adjacent to bone in normal human joints. It is likely that pannus in chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease develops by the recruitment of inflammatory cells augmenting this normal marginal tissue. Furthermore, overgrowth of tissue onto the cartilage surface may not be necessary in the pathogenesis of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, our findings suggest that cells in the periosteum, rather than those in the marginal synovium, may be involved in attempted \"repair\" mechanisms, such as osteophyte formation.\r"

Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluids (RA SF) contained no (less than 15 pg/ml) or very low amounts (less than 25 pg/ml) of IL-4, as measured by a sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. No IL-4 was produced by unstimulated rheumatoid synovial membrane. RA SF were found to inhibit phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-dependent proliferation of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). An inhibitory fraction with an apparent molecular weight of 150 kd was isolated by gel filtration. The inhibitory fraction strongly blocked the proliferation of PBL induced by PMA, PMA + IL-2, or PMA + IL-4. However, this fraction was less effective in blocking the proliferation of PBL induced by PMA + IL-2 + IL-4. High levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) were found in these RA SF, and an anti-TGF beta antibody was able to partially reduce the inhibitory activity. RA SF were found to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced IL-4 production by PBL. These data indicate that IL-4, similar to other T cell lymphokines, cannot be detected in RA SF and that RA SF contains an inhibitory activity, related in part to TGF beta, which blocks mitogen-induced proliferation of PBL, at least in part through an inhibition of T cell-derived lymphokine release.\r"

To overcome this problem, we generated monoclonal RF-secreting hybridomas from rheumatoid synovial cells. Among the RF-secreting hybridomas, HAF10 secreted an IgM-RF that was monospecific for human IgG. It bound well to IgG1 and IgG2, but not to IgG3 and IgG4. Sequence analysis of its heavy and light chains showed that it contained a VH1 heavy chain and a V lambda light chain that did not belong to any known lambda light chain subgroup, and therefore, probably represented a new lambda subgroup. These results indicated that both the heavy and light chains of a monoclonal IgM-RF from rheumatoid synovial cells were quite different from the reported variable region sequences of several monoclonal RF derived mainly from patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia. Further studies of additional monoclonal RF from RA patients are warranted to define precisely their genetic basis and to further our understanding of the immunopathology of RA.\r"

After extensive adsorption, the rabbit anti-Id were tested in a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Each anti-Id reacted predominantly with the immunizing synovial IgG and showed almost no reactivity with either pooled normal human serum IgG or with IgG from 50 normal donors. When identical amounts of matched rheumatoid arthritis serum IgG and synovial culture supernatant IgG were probed simultaneously with the corresponding rabbit anti-Id in an ELISA, 3 of 6 pairs demonstrated an increased concentration of specific idiotypes in the synovial culture supernatant IgG. Furthermore, when these 6 matched samples were subsequently analyzed by isoelectric focusing, individual IgG antibodies in 5 of 6 synovial IgG samples revealed enhanced reactivity with the corresponding rabbit anti-Id preparations, when compared with matched serum IgG. This increased synovial concentration of specific idiotypes detected by both the ELISA and isoelectric focusing was compatible with enhanced synovial tissue synthesis of the antibodies involved. These specific Id/anti-Id reactivities were not blocked by excess normal human Fc, Fab, or F(ab')2 fragments, indicating a lack of association of the stimulating synovial antibodies with rheumatoid factors or antibodies against other IgG fragments (pepsin agglutinators).\r"

In 1984, 14% of all 15.6 million community-dwelling elderly people had arthritis and no other chronic conditions; 41% had arthritis concurrently with other chronic conditions. Of the former group, 66% experienced limitations in physical activities, but only approximately 25% reported limitations in ADL or IADL in 1984. Among the group with arthritis and other chronic conditions, 82% were limited in at least 1 physical activity, and 41% were limited in ADL. With the passage of 2 years, 2% of elderly persons with arthritis and no other conditions had entered a nursing home, 7% had died, and the percentage reporting no limitation declined significantly. Among elderly persons with arthritis and other conditions, 4% entered a nursing home, 12% died, and the rates of all forms of limitation increased. It is essential to gather data such as these, on the prevalence and incidence of limitation among the elderly with arthritis, to ensure adequate long-term care services for an increasing aged population.\r"

The frequency of miscarriage, stillbirth, and small full-term infants was similar in all 3 study groups. Among the 4 Raynaud's phenomenon patients who had second-trimester miscarriages, 2 of 3 who were tested had moderately positive levels of IgG or IgM anticardiolipin antibody. Premature births were significantly more common in pregnancies that occurred after the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon (24%) than in pregnancies that occurred prior to the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon or in pregnancies among control subjects (9% and 1%, respectively). In addition, the mean weight of the full-term babies of women in both Raynaud's phenomenon groups was significantly less than that of babies born to controls. There were no neonatal deaths or other serious adverse outcomes. These findings may represent yet another manifestation of systemic vasospasm in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon.\r"

Six-year survival was 40% in patients with entry skin scores greater than or equal to 15 and 73% when skin scores were less than 15 (P less than 0.005). An entry skin score greater than or equal to 15 was associated with a high risk of early fatal renal and cardiac complications.\r"

H1 histones from rat organs were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and used as antigens in immunoblotting experiments. Sera containing anti-histone H1 antibodies were obtained from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Of the 9 sera tested, 2 reacted with only 1 H1 subtype. The other sera recognized different combinations of H1 subtypes. Only 1 serum reacted with all 6 H1 subtypes. Histones H1.5 and H1.1 were the subtypes most frequently recognized by the human autoantibodies. Our data indicate that human anti-H1 antibodies represent a heterogenous population, directed mainly against epitopes localized in the variable region of the H1 molecule.\r"

No clinical exacerbation of calcinosis occurred during treatment. Radiographs showed no new lesions, and there was reduction in the size of the existing lesions.

Hypoxia increased heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulmonary ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange ratio (R), blood lactate, and perceived exertion during exercise while depressing rectal temperature (Tre) and O2 uptake (VO2). Cold exposure elevated SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), VE, VO2, blood glucose, and blood glycerol but decreased HR, Tre, and R. Shivering and DBP were higher and Tre was lower in HC compared with NC. HR, SBP, VE, R, and lactate tended to be higher in HC compared with NC, whereas VO2 and blood glycerol tended to be depressed. These results suggest that cold exposure during hypoxia results in an increased reliance on shivering for thermogenesis at rest whereas, during exercise, heat loss is accelerated.\r"

The 10 coded samples included aliquots of the same sera that were distributed as positive and negative control sera, an aliquot of the WHO reference human anti-HIV-1 serum, and seven other sera from people with HIV-1 infection. Each laboratory reported features of its test methods and results. The results demonstrated excellent within laboratory and between laboratory consistency. The most important variable appeared to be the virus strain used. Cell line, conditions of neutralization or culture, method of endpoint determination, or use of VSV pseudotypes did not appear to be important variables. The results indicate that standardization of HIV-1 NA assays should be readily achievable.\r"

Purified antigens were used to immunize experimental animals to determine whether the removal of hypervariable regions from this type of gp120 immunogen had any effect on (1) the ability of the antigen to elicit virus neutralizing antibodies; and (2) the isolate specificity of the neutralizing antibodies that were elicited. The results of these studies demonstrate that, in addition to the previously identified V3 domain, at least two other hypervariable regions in gp120 are capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals. However, when all five of the hypervariable regions were deleted, the resulting antigen was no longer capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Finally, the neutralizing antibodies elicited by all of these nonglycosylated antigens were effective against HIV-SF2, the isolate from which the antigens were derived, but were not able to neutralize two divergent isolates, HIV-BRU or HIV-Zr6.\r"

However, these cell lines could act as NK-sensitive target cells if they were pulsed with heat-inactivated, whole simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The ability of these SIV-pulsed T-cell lines to act as NK-sensitive target cells was directly related to the relative density of CD4 on their surface. Target cell generation was inhibited by preincubation of cell lines with CD4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) with specificity for the SIV binding site. In addition, NK activity was seen against target cells that had been prepared with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120, nonglycosylated gp120, env A of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and simian type D retrovirus (SRV). Addition of leupeptin to target cells prior to SIV pulsing did not result in a significant decrease in cytotoxic activity, suggesting that processing is not required for the generation of target cells. The cells that mediate NK activity are nonadherent, do not form rosettes with AET-treated sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and are phenotypically CD16+ and CD8+. NK activity of SIV-infected macaques was significantly decreased against both K562 cells and SIV-pulsed target cells as compared with uninfected animals. However, treatment of PBMC with interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in a partial restoration of NK activity.\r"

Exercise tolerance testing was carried out off treatment and after beta blockade. beta Blockers were stopped and the patients were randomised to a control group and a study group of patients who undertook a one year high intensity training programme. The groups were then restudied. Submaximum heart rate was reduced by 13 beats per minute by training and by 23 beats per minute by atenolol. Training increased the maximum heart rate by 10 beats per minute and atenolol reduced it by 29 beats per minute. The double produce ST threshold was increased from 183 to 205 by training but reduced to 143 by atenolol. Maximum ST depression was similarly reduced by both training and atenolol. As a result of the effects on maximum heart rate, training produced a greater improvement in exercise tolerance than atenolol with a treadmill time increased from 741 seconds to 1272 seconds with training compared with 974 seconds with atenolol. Other variables were similarly affected. Thus the antianginal efficacy of exercise training is as good as that achieved by beta blockade and represents an alternative to such treatment.\r"

The heart rate response in patients with pacemakers was compared with the chronotropic response in 20 healthy controls of similar age and sex distribution who performed identical protocols. All pacemaker types adequately simulated the control heart rate response during the graded exercise treadmill test except during the early stages of exercise. However, during everyday activities, the response of ventricular rate responsive (VVIR) pacemakers was varied. Activity sensing systems rapidly overresponded to staircase descent, to changes in walking speed, and to suitcase lifting with the pacemaker arm, and these systems did not respond to mental stress. \"Physiological\" sensors (QT and minute ventilation units) responded slowly to rapid changes in physiological demand. The QT pacemaker patients did respond to mental stress but showed a paradoxical increase in rate during the recovery phases of burst exercise protocols such as staircase ascent/descent and walking deceleration. Dual chamber pacemakers in VDD, DDD, and DDDR modes most closely simulated the normal chronotropic response during everyday activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A signal averaged electrocardiogram was recorded in all patients and coronary angiography was performed in 45 (81.8%) of the streptokinase group and in 21 (35%) of the non-streptokinase group. At a 40 Hz filter setting ventricular late potentials were significantly less common in patients treated with streptokinase (9 (16.4%) of 55) than in those who were not (26 (43.3%) of 60). A total of 66 patients underwent angiography. Of the 26 who had closed infarct-related arteries, 17 had ventricular late potentials at a 40 Hz filter setting (sensitivity 65.4%, specificity 95%) and 38 of the 40 patients with a patent infarct-related artery did not have ventricular late potentials (sensitivity 80.9%, specificity 89.5%). Patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous streptokinase were significantly less likely to have ventricular late potentials than conservatively treated patients and the absence of ventricular late potentials at 40 Hz filter setting was a good non-invasive predictor that the infarct-related artery was patent.\r"

We describe an adaptation of an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) for von Willebrand factor antigen for this purpose. The results show that in endothelial cells in culture there was a good relationship between the number of cells and von Willebrand factor antigen measured by the IRMA. The relationships between the numbers of endothelial cells in biopsies of normal and healing wound skin as estimated by the histometric technique and the IRMA are less good (r = 0.45 and 0.32, respectively) but suggest that there is a positive and proportionate variation. There is a much stronger relationship (r = 0.79) between the biochemical and histometric methods in psoriatic skin.\r"

All the patients and seven normal controls were examined with bilateral isotope lymphography involving subcutaneous injection of 0.15 ml 99mTc-antimony sulphide colloid into the first web space of each foot. The percentage uptake of isotope-colloid in the inguinal lymph nodes at 1 and 2 h was equated with lymphatic function. Highly significant (P = 0.0001) differences existed between the different clinical groups and isotope lymphography discriminated well between oedema of lymphatic and non-lymphatic origin. Isotope lymphography appears to be a safe and useful test of lymphatic function.\r"

These subpopulations represent different stages in T-cell development and function. Recently, it has been shown that inflammatory and neoplastic CD4+ T-cell infiltrates are dominated by the memory subpopulation, whereas both subpopulations are about the same size in the peripheral blood. This was thought to be the result of in situ maturation of naive into memory T cells. We analysed early positive patch-test reactions 1-2 days after antigen challenge and found that most of the CD4+ T cells that had freshly immigrated into the tissue carried the memory phenotype. Their preferential migration may be mediated by at least five adhesion molecules expressed on their cell surface. This observation has important pathogenetic implications, since memory T cells can be rapidly activated by antigens and secrete a wide variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r"

VIP immunoreactivity (7.63 + 2.33 pmol/g, x + SE, n = 9) was more abundant than PHM immunoreactivity (3.86 + 0.56 pmol/g, x + SE, n = 9). Immunocytochemistry of sections of skin revealed a network of VIP/PHM immunoreactive nerve fibres around the perimeter of eccrine but not apocrine sweat glands. In vitro autoradiography of skin sections using 125I-labelled VIP and PHM, demonstrated binding sites on the membranes of eccrine gland secretory cells. The binding of each radiolabelled ligand was eliminated by the presence of a large molar excess of appropriate cold peptide but was unaffected when incubated with related peptide, indicating the presence of specific binding sites for both VIP and PHM. Radioimmunoassay of Sep-pak concentrated human sweat identified the presence of both VIP immunoreactivity (30.6 pmol/l) and PHM immunoreactivity (43.4 pmol/l). Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of axillary skin extracts and sweat, followed by radioimmunoassay of fractions, identified single resolved peaks of VIP and PHM immunoreactivity with identical retention times to synthetic standards. Eccrine sweat glands in human axillary skin have VIP and PHM peptidergic innervation and possess specific binding sites for each peptide which are both secreted to the surface of the skin.\r"

The skin colour of 807 participants was assessed in three ways: quantitatively, graded by a dermatologist, and self-reported. Quantitation of skin pigmentation was obtained by measuring the reflectance of light of wavelength 650 nm, at six sites. Females showed higher mean reflectance (paler skin) than males at all sites with the greatest difference on the lateral forearms. Prevalent skin cancer in males, and solar keratoses in both sexes were correlated with inherently pale skin colour on an unexposed site, and the presence of keratoses was correlated with darkly-pigmented backs of the hands (P less than 0.001). Both dermatologists' and participants' grading of skin colour were moderately correlated with measured skin colour. For dermatologists, correlation was highest with reflectance from the medial upper arms (r = 0.35, right arm; 0.30, left) in males, and the lateral forearms (r = 0.34, right; 0.38, left) in females. Correlations between reflectance values and self-reported innate skin colour were highest for the upper arms (r = 0.26, right; 0.24, left) in males, and for forearms (r = 0.42, right and left) in females. Prevalence of actinic lesions was more highly correlated with subjectively assessed skin colour than with quantitative skin pigmentation.\r"

During the campaign years (1986 and 1987) the number of patients with melanomas nearly doubled, and there was an increase in the proportion of thin, good prognosis lesions, and a fall in the proportion and absolute number of thick lesions. Data from the earlier years showed that median melanoma thickness had been decreasing throughout the series, well before the introduction of the campaign. A greater proportion of tumours of the superficial spreading variety was seen and also an increase in patients below the age of 40. These findings suggest that the biological characteristics of melanomas might be changing in addition to increased public and professional awareness.\r"

When overall endometrial development (histological dating) was considered, the proportion of women with unexplained infertility who had retarded endometrial development (20%) was found to be significantly higher than for women with normal fertility (3%) (P less than 0.01). When individual histological features were considered, women with unexplained infertility were found to have significant deviation from the normal range established from fertile women in only five of the 14 histological features measured. All of these five features related to the glandular but not to the stromal component of the endometrium; four of these five features are related to glandular secretory activity.\r"

At 24 years of age, 67% of the women still experienced dysmenorrhoea; 10% reported dysmenorrhoea which limited daily activity.

Dysmenorrhoea was reduced (P less than 0.001) in oral contraceptive users. The severity of dysmenorrhoea was significantly associated with the duration of menstrual flow, menarcheal age and cigarette smoking. The severity of dysmenorrhoea was not associated with age as an isolated factor, nor with height, weight, length of menstrual cycle or frequency of physical exercise.\r"

In the SGA fetuses the time to peak velocity at the level of pulmonary artery was significantly lower and at the level of the aorta significantly higher than in AGA fetuses. During maternal hyperoxygenation the aortic time to peak velocity decreased towards normal range but there was no significant change at the level of the pulmonary artery. These results may indicate variations of aortic and pulmonary pressures in SGA fetuses that can be partially modified by maternal hyperoxygenation and which may be associated with changes in the peripheral resistance of the cerebral circulation.\r"

Of the 56% who responded, the majority (87%) routinely close the vault. An interrupted mattress suture is used by 60%, a continuous suture by 43% and the Lembert suture by 2%. Chromic catgut is favoured by 60%, a synthetic polymer by 33% and plain catgut by 6%. We then organized a prospective, randomized trial involving 114 women who underwent total abdominal hysterectomy for benign indications. No. 1 polygalactide (Vicryl) was used in 58 women, and No. 1 chromic catgut in 56. Overall, 37 (32%) had vault granulations 6 weeks post-operatively. Chromic catgut had been used in 25 (68%) and polygalactide in the remaining 12 (32%) (P = 0.01). Only 2 (5%) of these women denied any symptoms, while the rest complained of vaginal discharge, bleeding or both. Neither the patients' age, weight or parity, nor the status of the surgeon influenced the occurrence of granulations. We conclude that the widespread use of chromic catgut revealed by our survey is unacceptable: polygalactide, a synthetic polymer, is associated with fewer vaginal vault granulations than chromic catgut.\r"

Forty-six of these women were sent a questionnaire about the course of pregnancies subsequent to treatment with methotrexate and actinomycin D. Only 30 of these women had had the desire to get pregnant; 10 had had one, 13 had had two, and six had had three further children. It is concluded that treatment with combination of methotrexate and actinomycin D is safe in terms of preserving fertility.\r"

A study was undertaken to determine optimum conditions for oral fluorescein angiography. Capsules proved more convenient than a solution for ingestion of fluorescein. A dose of 25 mg/kg body weight produced good quality angiograms in 75% of the patients. The best pictures were obtained by photographing the fundus after 40 and 60 minutes.\r"

The degree of visual impairment in the high risk group tended to be more severe than in the low risk group.

The transbronchial lung biopsy was more likely to be positive in black patients (p = 0.009) and in patients with pulmonary infiltrates on chest x ray (p = 0.0044). In comparison, the conjunctival biopsy was more likely to be positive in patients with conjunctival follicles (p = 0.036), ocular abnormalities consistent with sarcoidosis (p = 0.02), and in patients with pulmonary infiltrates on chest x ray (p = 0.029). Iritis was present in 12 patients, enlarged lacrimal glands in three, and vitritis in five. We conclude that the conjunctival biopsy is an effective means of diagnosing sarcoidosis and that every sarcoidosis patient should have an ophthalmic examination.\r"

The patient's right retina was observed with an infrared television fundus camera, and the fundus image was recorded on video tape. The position of the eye during nystagmus, observed via the fundus camera and recorded on video, was analysed at every 1/60 second intervals. The displacement in degrees between the fixation target, projected on to the retina, and the foveola was measured for each interval. Using biofeedback, the subjects could voluntarily suppress nystagmus and prolong foveation time. A damping of the nystagmus amplitude, intensity, and frequency was observed. On the average the intensity decreased by about 40%, and the foveation time was prolonged by about 190%. After completion of the training all the patients reported a subjective improvement in their vision when suppressing their nystagmus. Possibly biofeedback training acts to reduce the nystagmus and extend foveation time, thereby improving the ability to fixate.\r"

The results indicate a high prevalence of non-compliance, compounded by an inability adequately to instill a drop into the eye. About half the patients had difficulty aiming the drop, and other problems including squeezing the bottle, blinking, and seeing the tip of the bottle. Ability tests included a measurement of the grip strength of patients to complement measurement of the force required to expel a drop from a bottle. Some patients, particularly those with arthritis, could not generate enough force to squeeze a bottle. These same patients also had difficulty with the other movements required to administer drops. While some attempts have been made to produce devices to assist with eyedrops which can improve the aim of the patient, none give assistance in expelling a drop. An additional problem found was the reluctance of patients to admit to medical staff that they experienced any difficulty with their drops.\r"

A useful field of binocular single vision was achieved in 27 patients (71%) after one operation and in seven patients (18%) after more than one, whereas double vision was persistent in four (11%). No recurrence of diplopia was seen during one year of follow-up. No differences were found in duration of eye disease, angle of deviation, or in prior forms of treatment between patients who responded well to a single operation and those who needed more surgical procedures or those who responded less well. We conclude that, although the individual outcome cannot be predicted, every patient with diplopia and stable Graves' ophthalmopathy has an 89% chance of binocular single vision after extraocular muscle surgery. Prior treatment does not appear to influence this outcome.\r"

These results do not support previously published hypotheses that muscle hypertrophy or levator/superior rectus muscle overaction secondary to inferior rectus muscle restriction are major causes of lid retraction and lid lag. Local adhesion of the levator muscle to fixed orbital tissues is postulated to be the most likely basis for the characteristic lid retraction and lid lag of Graves' ophthalmopathy.\r"

We conducted a prospective study to determine the incidence of this complication in our patients. We identified one case of globe perforation in 67 patients (100 eyes). Twenty-two patients (44 eyes) had undergone previous strabismus surgery, and there was no evidence of previous scleral perforation in this group. We discuss the recent advances in strabismus surgery which may account for this difference in the incidence of scleral perforation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To establish whether ABO blood group is related to ischaemic heart disease on an individual and geographic basis in Britain. DESIGN--Prospective study of 7662 men with known ABO blood group selected from age-sex registers in general practices in 24 British towns. MEASUREMENTS--ABO blood group, standard cardiovascular risk factors, social class, and presence or absence of ischaemic heart disease determined at entry to study. END POINTS--Eight year follow up of fatal and nonfatal ischaemic heart disease events achieved for 99% of study population. RESULTS--Towns with a higher prevalence of blood group O had higher incidences of ischaemic heart disease. In individual subjects, however, the incidence of ischaemic heart disease was higher in those with group A than in those with other blood groups (relative risk 1.21, 95% confidence limits 1.01 to 1.46). Total serum cholesterol concentration was slightly higher in subjects of blood group A. No other cardiovascular risk factor (including social class) was related to blood group. CONCLUSIONS--Blood group A is related to the incidence of ischaemic heart disease in individual subjects. Geographic differences in the distribution of ABO blood groups do not explain geographic variation in rates of ischaemic heart disease in Britain. The findings do not support the view that ABO blood group and social class are related.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the influence of general or regional anaesthesia on long term mental function in elderly patients. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients randomly allocated to receive general or regional anaesthesia. SETTING--The patients' homes and a large teaching hospital in Cardiff. SUBJECTS--146 Patients aged 60 and over scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Scores achieved in tests of cognitive function and functional competence. RESULTS--72 Patients were allocated to receive general anaesthesia and 74 regional anaesthesia. Anaesthetic technique did not influence the duration of the operation, time to mobilisation postoperatively, requirements for analgesia after the operation, or duration of stay in hospital. Three months after the operation there was an improvement in the score for the recognition component (76 ms, 95% confidence interval 9 to 144) and the response component (82 ms, 5 to 158) of the choice reaction time in the group receiving general anaesthesia compared with the group receiving regional anaesthesia. This was the only significant difference between the two groups in the assessments of cognitive and functional competence. Eleven patients receiving regional anaesthesia and 12 receiving general anaesthesia reported that their memory and concentration were worse than before the operation, but this was not confirmed by testing. CONCLUSION--Cognitive and functional competence in elderly patients was not detectably impaired after either general or regional anaesthesia when attention was paid to the known perioperative influences on mental function.\r"

SETTING--Two surgical and two gynaecological wards. PATIENTS--50 Patients admitted to hospital for cholecystectomy and 51 admitted for hysterectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Visual analogue scales with no divisions were completed by the patients immediately after each dose of postoperative analgesia was administered throughout their stay in hospital. A questionnaire completed on the fifth postoperative day recorded patients' recollections of their experience. Opinions were also sought from medical and nursing staff. RESULTS--During the first 24 hours after surgery recorded pain levels were 60% of the maximum and were not influenced by age, sex, or the type of operation performed. The median interval between the return of pain and a further injection of analgesic was 2 hours (interquartile range 1 to 3.5 hours). Expectations of pain relief were low, and for 70% of the patients the pain was at least as bad as they had expected. Only half of the medical and nursing staff questioned thought that postoperative analgesia should relieve pain completely; drugs were prescribed and administered with too little attention to the patient's response and too much concern about adverse effects and opioid dependence. CONCLUSIONS--The results suggest that the standard of postoperative pain relief is poor because of inadequate education of patients in what to expect (and demand), and of medical and nursing staff in how to prescribe and administer analgesia with reference to individual drug response.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate the effects on general practitioners' activities of a change in their remuneration from a capitation based system to a mixed fee per item and capitation based system. DESIGN--Follow up study with data collected from contact sheets completed by general practitioners in one period before (March 1987) a change in their remuneration system and two periods after (March 1988, November 1988), with a control group of general practitioners with a mixed fee per item and capitation based system throughout. SETTING--General practices in Copenhagen city (index group) and Copenhagen county (control group). SUBJECTS--265 General practitioners in Copenhagen city, of whom 100 were selected randomly from the 130 who agreed to participate (10 exclusions) and 326 general practitioners in Copenhagen county. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of consultations (face to face and by telephone) and renewals of prescriptions, diagnostic and curative services, and specialist and hospital referrals per 1000 enlisted patients in one week. RESULTS--Of the 75 general practitioners who completed all three sheets, four were excluded for incomplete data. Total contact rates per 1000 patients listed rose significantly compared with the rates before the change index in the city (100.0 before the change v 111.7 (95% confidence interval 106.4 to 117.4 after the change) and over the same time in the control group (100.0 v 106.0), but within a year these rates fell (to 104.2(99.1 to 109.6) and 104.0 respectively). There was an increase in consultations by telephone initially but not thereafter. Rates of examinations and treatments that attracted specific additional remuneration after the change rose significantly compared with those before (diagnostic services, 138.1 (118.7 to 160.5) and 159.5 (137.8 to 184.7) and curative services 194.6 (152.2 to 248.9) and 194.8(152.3 to 249.2) for second and third data collections respectively) and with the control group (diagnostic services 105.3, 107.6 and curative services 106.0, 115.0) whereas referral rates to secondary care fell (specialist referrals 90.1 (80.7 to 100.6) and 77.0 (68.6 to 86.4) and hospital referrals 87.4 (71.1 to 107.5) and 68.4 (54.7 to 85.4] in doctors in the city. CONCLUSIONS--Introducing a partial fee for service system seemed to stimulate the provision of services by general practitioners, resulting in reduced referral rates. The concept of a \"target income\" which doctors aim at, rather than maximising their income seemed to play a part in adjustment to changing the system of remuneration.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the impact on mortality of a child survival strategy, mostly based on preventive interventions. DESIGN--Cross sectional comparison of cause specific mortality in two communities differing in the type, coverage, and quality of maternal and child health and family planning services. In the intervention area the services were mainly preventive, community based, and home delivered. SUBJECTS--Neonates, infants, children, and mothers in two contiguous areas of rural Bangladesh. INTERVENTIONS--In the intervention area community health workers provided advice on contraception and on feeding and weaning babies; distributed oral rehydration solution, vitamin A tablets for children under 5, and ferrous fumarate and folic acid during pregnancy; immunised children; trained birth attendants in safe delivery and when to refer; treated minor ailments; and referred seriously ill people and malnourished children to a central clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Overall and age and cause specific death rates, obtained by a multiple step \"verbal autopsy\" process. RESULTS--During the two years covered by the study overall mortality was 17% lower among neonates, 9% lower among infants aged 1-5 months, 30% lower among children aged 6-35 months, and 19% lower among women living in the study area than in those living in the control area. These differences were mainly due to fewer deaths from neonatal tetanus, measles, persistent diarrhoea with severe malnutrition among children, and fewer abortions among women. CONCLUSIONS--The programme was effective in preventing some deaths. In addition to preventive components such as tetanus and measles immunisation, health and nutrition education, and family planning, curative services are needed to reduce mortality further.\r"
