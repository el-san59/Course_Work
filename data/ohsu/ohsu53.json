The effect of these materials on the strength and on the surface area of patch test reactions caused by epoxy resin was assessed in 11 volunteers with a known allergy to epoxy resins. Standard amounts of barrier cream and spray coating were applied on the skin. Then patch tests were carried out with epoxy resin on the pretreated sites. After 24 h patches were removed, 48 h thereafter the strength and surface area of the reactions were scored. Results were compared with the score of a control test. The use of 2 barrier creams resulted in a significant reduction of the surface area of the patch test reactions. Spray coatings significantly reduced both the strength and the surface area of the reactions. Our results suggest that methacrylate spray coatings and barrier creams may provide protection against epoxy resins during a test period of 24 h. However, the development of new formulations, adapted more specifically to this purpose, is necessary.\r"

Permeation studies revealed that BDDGE penetrates disposable PVC and rubber gloves in less than 30 min; thus, contaminated gloves should be replaced immediately. Reactive diluents should be included in patch test series if contact allergy to epoxy products is suspected.\r"

Cells were tested in standard medium and in the presence of patients' serum. Blood granulocytes and monocytes were purified and separately exposed to opsonized zymosan (to test C3 receptor function), immunoglobulin-coated erythrocytes (to test Fc receptor function), and glutaraldehyde-treated erythrocytes (to test nonspecific binding structures). Phagocytosis and superoxide anion production were measured. Granulocytes of patients exhibited a substantial decrease of zymosan ingestion (p less than .05), whereas phagocytosis of other particles was normal. Monocytes from the patients displayed an unselective overall decrease of phagocytic ability for the three particle types (p less than .05). Patients' sera were at least as efficient as a pool of normal sera in opsonizing zymosan. Further, no phagocytic inhibitor was found in the tested patients. In conclusion, we point out a deficiency of membrane receptors of neutrophils and monocytes in ICU patients with nosocomial infection.\r"

Accordingly, the practical issue of whether such measurements might be equally valid on blood sampled from the right atrium or superior vena cava or from the pulmonary artery was investigated. In blood sampled prospectively on 50 occasions in 12 patients (group 1), arterial blood lactate ranged from 0.39 to 9.71 mmol/L. A very high correlation (r = .995) was observed between blood sampled simultaneously from an arterial and central venous catheter. The maximum absolute difference was 0.5, and mean difference 0.029 mmol/L. Comparable correlations were obtained between arterial and simultaneously sampled pulmonary artery blood (r = .994). We analyzed retrospectively the results of lactate analyses on 104 paired blood samples from the pulmonary artery and peripheral artery in 23 critically ill and injured patients (group 2) whose arterial blood lactates ranged from 0.46 to 12.99 mmol/L. We also found a high correlation (r = .998) between arterial and simultaneously sampled pulmonary artery blood lactate. The maximum absolute difference was 0.82, and the mean difference 0.03 mmol/L. These data demonstrate that lactate measurements in venous blood sampled either from a pulmonary artery or from a central venous catheter yield lactate concentrations essentially equivalent to those in arterial blood.\r"

Despite preventative measures and a restricted antibiotic policy, 23.6% of patients developed secondary infections. Patients admitted after multiple trauma were the only diagnostic category of patients who showed a significantly increased incidence of secondary infections. The length of hospitalization and number of patients who had intubations or tracheostomies was higher in the group with secondary infection; the causal relationship was difficult to establish. Patients who were not intubated or tracheostomized did not develop secondary infection. Prior administration of antibiotics did not appear to influence the incidence of secondary infection. There was a significant increase in secondary infections in patients with a higher therapeutic intervention scoring system score. The predominant pathogens cultured were highly resistant Gram-negative organisms, particularly Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive pathogen. The ICU course was probably prolonged by the complication of nosocomial infection, which may have contributed to the deaths.\r"

On removal, 5-cm catheter segments from the catheter tip and from within the introducer and sleeve, peripheral blood, and blood drawn from the PAC distal port were cultured quantitatively. Sleeve segment cultures were sterile if catheterization was less than 48 h and had been accomplished through a new percutaneous site. The risk of growing greater than 10(3) colonies on the tip and introducer segment increased to greater than 30% when PACs were left in over 96 h. The incidence of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), defined as the simultaneous growth of identical organisms from the blood and the PAC tip, was 5.3% but may have been underestimated. CRB was associated with the use of corticosteroids (p = .009) and with cultures from any PAC segment growing more than 10(3) colonies (p less than .01). Although our data suggest that the use of the sterile protective sleeve is associated with a low risk of colonization, further study will be required to delineate the relationship between the use of protective sleeves and CRB.\r"

Patients admitted with acute dyspnea, particularly those with chronic pulmonary disease, were at a significantly greater (p less than .01) risk of arrest. All but one of the other arrests occurred in patients who were rated unstable on admission and who had further deterioration of pre-existing problems in the hospital (p less than .0001). The deterioration rates were highest among patients rated as unstable, particularly in patients with comorbid disease. Patients who are unstable on admission or who begin to deteriorate due to comorbid disease or the condition leading to admission, should be considered at extremely high risk for subsequent arrest and should be admitted to critical care units for early observation.\r"

Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) was the most frequently used weaning technique in 90.2% of the responding hospitals. IMV was also listed as the primary mode of mechanical ventilatory support (71.6%). IMV to a T-tube system was the most common weaning protocol in nonuniversity hospitals. IMV to 3 to 5 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure and IMV to T-tube were equally utilized in university/university-affiliated centers. PaCO2 was identified the most often (20.7%) and physiologic deadspace ratio the least often (2.5%) as a weaning criterion. We conclude that IMV is probably the most widely practiced weaning technique and that a variety of weaning criteria were employed.\r"

HPT levels were depressed in MAT, presumably due to removal of hemoglobin-HPT complexes from the serum. TRF was severely depressed in MAT and may be implicated in the higher infection susceptibility in this group. CER was elevated in C, suggesting a stimulating mechanism in this group as opposed to H and MAT. Explanation for this is unknown. APP changes, especially CRP, may be useful as markers of the amount of tissue damage.\r"

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of DI in children with brain death. The medical records of 34 patients with a diagnosis of brain death were reviewed. Diuresis was present in 76% of patients; however, DI was only present in 38% of patients. On autopsy, the pituitary gland in six patients revealed varying degrees of edema, congestion, hemorrhage, and coagulative necrosis. We concluded that DI is present in many, but not all, patients who experience brain death and therefore, cannot be relied on solely as a marker of brain death.\r"

  ".W": "Defibrillation after prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF) is frequently followed by asystole or electromechanical dissociation (EMD) which are usually fatal. We studied the effects of glucagon, a known inotropic and chronotropic agent, during 19 episodes of postcountershock asystole/EMD in nine dogs. Systolic and diastolic aortic (Ao), left ventricular, pulmonary arterial, and right atrial (RA) pressures were recorded as was the instantaneous Ao-RA difference (coronary perfusion pressure) and coronary sinus blood flow (CSF) during closed-chest CPR. VF was induced electrically; 2 min later, a 400-J transthoracic shock was given. Countershock was always followed by asystole (n = 12) or EMD (n = 7). Conventional closed-chest CPR with a mechanical device was begun 30 to 60 sec after countershock and continued for 2 to 3 min. If a perfusing rhythm did not occur, glucagon (1 mg) was given iv and CPR continued for 2 to 3 min more. Glucagon had no significant effect on intravascular pressures, the coronary perfusion gradient, or CSF when compared to CPR alone. However, in 14 or 19 postcountershock episodes unresponsive to CPR alone, glucagon restored effective spontaneous circulation, i.e., successful cardiac resuscitation, due to its effects on the intrinsic pacemaker discharge rate. Glucagon has been previously shown to stimulate myocardial adenyl cyclase via nonadrenergic mechanisms. We conclude that when postcountershock asystole/EMD occurs, glucagon has a direct and favorable effect on cardiac resuscitation outcome due to its effects on pacemaker discharge rate which is not mediated by changes in myocardial blood flow or coronary perfusion pressure.\r"

Twenty-one nondisposable transducers assembled with sterile plastic disposable domes and extension tubing were utilized. The systems were prefilled with heparinized flush solution (2 U sodium heparin per ml normal saline). Flush solution samples were cultured from the distal end of the equipment immediately after set-up (time 0) and 24, 48, and 72 h after set-up in all 21 transducers. In 11 of 21 transducers, cultures were also taken at 168 h (1 wk) and 336 h (2 wk) after set-up. Out of the total 106 cultures, only two showed growth, both of which proved to be external skin or mouth contaminants. Binomial distribution testing indicated that if a .05 probability level was used, the chance was 1.3% that one or more transducers in 100 could become contaminated by 72 h. Using the same statistical analyses for the 66 cultures involving the 11 transducers cultured for 2 wk, the chance of contamination in 100 cultures is 2.7% at 2 wk. We conclude from these data that nondisposable transducer systems, when preassembled using standard aseptic precautions and sterile disposable plastics, show no evidence of significant contamination when allowed to stand in readiness after assembly but not connected to a patient. We feel it is safe to preassemble transducers for at least a 72-h period before use. Longer intervals from set-up to use may also be justified.\r"

In our review of the records of 19 critically ill patients whose ulcers perforated, we found that classical symptoms were frequently absent. The perforations often were manifested by nonspecific clinical events, such as unexplained ileus or hypotension. Diagnosis was typically delayed and on occasion was first suspected after observing pneumoperitoneum on a routine x-ray. While the ulcers were characteristically very large (greater than 2 cm), minimal inflammation surrounded them. Mortality was 56% in the 16 patients whose perforations were diagnosed before death or discharge. Fifteen patients were treated with simple patching of the ulcer. Perforated ulcers in critically ill patients differ in several important ways from those occurring in otherwise healthy individuals.\r"

To assess the efficacy of metoprolol, a relatively selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent, we administered this agent to 11 patients (aged 71.8 +/- 8.3 yr). All patients had serious pulmonary disease. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities were corrected before the study. Nine patients were receiving theophylline derivatives and six digoxin. Serum levels for both drugs were in the therapeutic range. Four patients had received verapamil without control of MAT. Mean atrial rate before administration of metoprolol was 142.3 +/- 17.2 beat/min and mean ventricular rate was 131.4 +/- 24.3 beat/min. One to 3 h after metoprolol (25 or 50 mg orally), all patients were restored to sinus rhythm, with a mean ventricular rate of 86.9 +/- 6.8 beat/min (p less than .01). Six patients had 3 to 6 premature atrial contractions per minute. No adverse effects were noted, and arterial blood gases before and after therapy were comparable. Five patients expired from their underlying disease and four were continued on metoprolol to maintain sinus rhythm. Metoprolol is effective in the acute and chronic treatment of MAT and may be given to patients with MAT and respiratory failure without serious adverse effects.\r"

Six healthy dogs were ventilated using HFJV and another six with conventional mechanical ventilation. ICP and its pulse amplitude (Amp) were measured by means of an epidural transducer, and CE was assessed by analysis of the relationship between the Amp and the mean ICP. The mean ICP, under basal conditions, did not differ between the two forms of ventilation, the Amp and the slope of the relationship Amp/ICP being lower with HFJV (p less than .001). Since the lower airway pressure created with HFJV was the only difference, it is suggested that the differences found in this study are related to these pressures.\r"

EVLW ranged over a wide spectrum from 187 to 1163 ml (2.4 to 18.6 ml/kg). The mean coefficient of variation of ten consecutive measurements was 13.6%. Spontaneously breathing patients showed significantly (p less than .05) higher coefficients of variation (16.1 +/- 6.8%) than patients on mechanical ventilation (10.8 +/- 4.2%). Other factors affecting reproducibility could not be clearly identified. Because in lung water estimation mean values of consecutive measurements are compared, we defined an EVLW determination as the mean value of three consecutive EVLW measurements. When comparing consecutive EVLW determinations in hemodynamically stable patients, we found in many that consecutive EVLW determinations varied no more than +/- 15%. These differences probably have to be attributed to the reproducibility of EVLW measurements and have to be considered, when changes in thermal-dye lung water measured by a lung water computer are discussed.\r"

The esophageal tracheal combitube (ETC) is a new airway, designed for emergency intubation providing sufficient ventilation whether the airway is placed into the trachea or into the esophagus. We evaluated the effectiveness of the ETC in 31 patients during CPR. Blood gas analyses obtained during esophageal placement of the ETC showed results comparable to those of ventilation with a conventional endotracheal airway (ETA). The ETC appeared to oxygenate and ventilate patients adequately without complications. The efficacy, safety, and ease of insertion ensure rapid airway control. It is concluded that the ETC provides a sufficient alternative to the ETA whenever ideal conditions or trained staff for endotracheal intubation are not immediately available.\r"

In these eight patients, there was no relationship between pulse flow resistance and the degree of OSA in contrast to significant relationships in postmenopausal women, and men. Hypercapnia occurred in three premenopausal women, no postmenopausal women and in two men.

Twenty-nine cases had a preceding nondiagnostic bronchoscopic procedure, and nine others underwent open lung biopsy because of progressive deterioration despite treatment for diseases diagnosed bronchoscopically. We found that open lung biopsy was likely to be useful diagnostically when bronchoscopy could not be safely performed or when a preceding bronchoscopic procedure was not diagnostic. Open lung biopsies done on patients whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment for disorders established bronchoscopically were not likely to yield information therapeutically useful. In only one of nine such cases was a new treatable diagnosis obtained (Legionella). The others showed either severe pulmonary fibrosis or persistence of the initial disease process diagnosed at the time of bronchoscopy.\r"

In the first 11 patients who were spontaneously breathing, enoximone significantly decreased pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, mean systemic arterial pressure, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Cardiac output remained unchanged, while heart rate increased slightly. Lung resistance decreased and dynamic lung compliance increased. Blood gas values remained unchanged. Similar effects were observed in the next eight patients who were artificially ventilated, except for an increase in cardiac output.

  ".W": "A noninvasive point score system for the evaluation of severity of aortic stenosis (AS) was employed in a prospective study of 153 patients (mean age 64.8 +/- 0.8 years) referred from invasive studies or for the evaluation of a systolic murmur. Seven variables were recorded and scored as follows: LVH by ECG (0-2); aortic valve calcium by chest x-ray film (0-2); loudness of A2 (0-2); Q-peak of murmur (0-3); T-time of carotid pulse (0-3); ejection time (0-3); and LVH by echo (0-1). Range of the total score was 0-16. All patients had the aortic valve area (AVA) determined by cardiac catheterization. Data analysis revealed that the relation between the total score and the AVA was curvilinear with a score greater than or equal to 5 correctly identifying 100/107 (93 percent) of patients with a valve area of less than or equal to 1.0 cm2. If the patients with an AVA of less than or equal to 1.0 cm2 were considered severe and patients with a total score less than 5 were considered mild-moderate, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy for a score greater than or equal to 5 were 93 percent, 96 percent, and 98 percent, respectively. The relation between the score and aortic valve gradient (AVG) was linear with a score of greater than or equal to 5 correctly identifying 84/88 (95 percent) with an AVG greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg. If the patients with a pressure gradient over 40 mm Hg were considered severe, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy for a score greater than or equal to 5 were 95 percent, 72 percent, and 82 percent, respectively. It is concluded that a point score system employing seven noninvasive variables is simple and accurate in identifying patients with severe AS and would be a valuable addition to a Doppler determined gradient.\r"

  ".W": "Although a fall in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) during exercise has been reported in patients with advanced lung disease due to cystic fibrosis (CF), not every patient with advanced disease desaturates, and pulmonary function tests have not been considered predictive as to which patient will desaturate. This study evaluated oxygen desaturation by ear oximetry during a progressive exercise test in 21 patients with CF and compared it to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DCO), all expressed as percent predicted. During exercise, the SaO2 fell less than 0.25 percent per ml of the maximal O2 consumption per kilogram of body weight to values never less than 90 percent in 15 patients (group A), whereas it fell more than this and always to values at the end of exercise of less than 90 percent in six others (group B). The FEV1 ranged from 103 percent predicted to 37 percent for group A compared to 28 to 17 percent in group B, while the range of FEV1/FVC was 87 to 52 percent for group A and 54 to 40 percent for group B. The range of DCO for group A was 129 to 84 percent compared to 64 to 54 percent. In conclusion, this study found that both the FEV1 and the DCO could separate those that had significant desaturation from those that did not and that no patient with a DCO of 80 percent or greater had significant desaturation during exercise.\r"

Gallium uptake was seen in the lung in 17 of the 20 progressively dyspneic patient's and none of the 16 nonprogressive patients (chi square = 22.5, p less than 0.001). The BAL fluid in the progressive patients had a higher percentage of neutrophils (13.4 percent +/- 2.88) and lymphocytes (16.1 percent +/- 2.75) than in the nonprogressive patients (neutrophils = 3.3 +/- 1.30 percent; lymphocytes = 5.6 +/- 1.57 percent, p less than 0.02 for both). Of the 19 progressive patients who were treated with steroids or cyclophosphamide, six had only increased neutrophils in their BAL fluid and all died. The remaining 13 treated progressive patients had increased lymphocytes or a normal BAL (two patients): six had improvement in their vital capacity, six have had stable function, and one died. We found gallium scan and BAL useful in assessing progressive pulmonary fibrosis in collagen vascular disease.\r"

Twelve patients required simultaneous graft replacement of aortic aneurysms. Five procedures were performed through a median sternotomy and 12 through a left posterior lateral thoracotomy. Deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest was used on three occasions. All but one patient were early survivors, and there were no related cerebrovascular accidents. There were five late deaths unrelated to operative treatment. Surgical treatment of aneurysms of the intrathoracic segment of the subclavian artery is both well tolerated and durable.\r"

One patient had an initial response to plasmapheresis, which allowed assisted mechanical ventilation to be discontinued.

We compared these results with data obtained from 22 non-COPD patients matched with regard to age, height, weight, and sex distribution. In the COPD patients, diaphragm muscle mass was 213 +/- SD 69 g, thickness was .320 +/- .055 cm, area was 647 +/- 160 cm2, coronal muscle length was 27.8 +/- 4.0 cm and sagittal muscle length was 15.8 +/- 2.8 cm. These values were within +/- 8 percent of the comparable values in the non-COPD patients, with no significant differences. There was no correlation between diaphragm length and lung volume in 13 COPD patients with TLC and ten with RV measurements. We conclude that over the range of lung volume encountered (TLC 135 +/- 28 percent predicted, RV 102 +/- 29 percent predicted TLC), there is no evidence for permanent shortening of the diaphragm.\r"

Twenty-six patients (39.4 percent) were between one and two years old; 52 (78.8 percent) were under age ten. Forty-four FBs (67 percent) were fruit and vegetable seeds and nuts. Soft organic material (meat, cucumber peels) was found in four patients, chicken bones in six, pins and needles in six, other nonorganic materials (toys, stone, broken thermometer) in six. In 55 patients, the FB was removed at bronchoscopy; three patients coughed up the FB shortly after bronchoscopy. Eight patients were operated on because the impacted FB could not be removed at repeat bronchoscopy trials. In this group, the FB was removed through a bronchotomy in two patients, but in six, pulmonary resection was necessary because of severe bronchiectasis (FBs had been impacted from ten months to 12 years). Stiff bronchoscope was used in all patients. In several cases, the flexible bronchoscope was used initially but proved inadequate. There were three complications, two related to hypoxia, but no deaths. Infants and little children should be prevented from reaching peanuts and seeds. When presence of a FB is suspected, and in children with unresolving pneumonic process, early bronchoscopy is mandatory. Expert anesthesia is essential, and hypoxia must be avoided.\r"

The dogs were anesthetized and graded Nd-YAG laser burns of 50, 100, and 200 Joules (J) were produced on the distal tracheal walls with a laser fiber inserted through a bronchoscope. One dog was killed immediately after injury and the other 24 hours later. At the time of killing, the trachea was excised and prepared for light microscopic (LM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination. We found that the injury produced by the 50 J intensity beam was confined to the mucosa and submucosa, with no destruction of the tracheal cartilage; by contrast, transmural penetration of the trachea was observed at intensities of 100 and 200 J. These results indicate that a strong correlation exists between laser intensity and the magnitude of the resulting tracheal injury. We suggest that the intensity of a Nd-YAG laser, endoscopically directed perpendicular to the tracheal wall, should not exceed 50 J in order to minimize the risk of perforating the tracheal wall.\r"

A degree of rectal prolapse was demonstrated in eight of the SRUS patients; six of these lesions were clinically occult. Abnormal failure of the anal sphincter to relax on voiding was present in seven of the SRUS patients. These abnormalities resulted in the SRUS patients requiring a greater increase in intrarectal pressure (median, 100 cm water) to void than the control subjects (median, 65 cm water, P less than 0.01). This combination of high intrarectal pressure and rectal prolapse during staining seems to be the cause of SRUS.\r"

  ".W": "During the past ten years, substantial progress has been made in the knowledge of the natural history of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal and of the response of the disease to radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. At the present time, the main problem in the management of this tumor concerns identification of the best modalities to achieve local control and preservation of anal function. From a series of 276 cases, followed for more than three years, the necessity for a careful pretreatment evaluation was stressed. This included a systematic search for pelvic metastatic lymph nodes by palpation and CT scan. All patients were treated initially by irradiation except those who underwent groin dissection for inguinal node metastasis or colostomy for complete anal obstruction. Three groups of patients have been identified: unresectable or disseminated tumors (33 cases), resectable tumors but not suitable for sphincter conservation (21 cases) treated by radiochemotherapy and delayed surgery, and resectable tumors suitable for sphincter conservation (222 cases) which were treated by a split-course regimen combining a short course of carefully planned external beam irradiation (19 days) followed by an iridium 192 implant after a two-month rest. In this group, which represents 80 percent of the whole series, 80 percent of patients have had their cancer controlled and 90 percent of controlled patients have retained normal anal function. The use of chemotherapy during the first days of irradiation is advisable in all cases to reinforce the efficacy of treatment and increase the chance of anal preservation. Results of the split-course regimen, combining external beam and interstitial irradiation, demonstrate a clear superiority over external beam irradiation alone, especially for large infiltrating tumors, which represent the majority of cases.\r"

Brushing cytology under direct vision at fiberoptic colonoscopy, is a safe, reliable, and quite accurate method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer. The results from brush cytology did not relate to the configuration and appearance of the tumor. For cell brushing, the fluid in the colonic lumen should be aspirated off as thoroughly as possible. Cell brushings are often positive when colonic stricture and obstruction prevent the colonoscope from reaching the lesion; biopsy, obviously, cannot be done in such a case.\r"

Patients with canal tumors had an erroneous diagnosis made more frequently than patients with margin tumors. In both groups patients with an erroneous diagnosis had longer histories than patients with a correct diagnosis. Among patients with erroneously diagnosed canal tumor, pain, the feeling of a lump, anal discharge, and pruritus ani occurred less frequently than among correctly diagnosed patients. The prognosis was worse among patients with erroneously diagnosed canal tumors compared with correctly diagnosed patients. Such a difference could not be found among patients with margin tumors. There was a gradual worsening of the prognosis among patients with increasing length of history and canal tumors, in contrast to patients with margin tumors, in whom only a history of more than 18 months was associated with a worse prognosis.\r"

In order to find the predisposing factors the charts of 20 early pouch patients were reviewed; ten of these patients had these complications and ten constituted a control group. There were two striking findings about the complication group: a tendency toward more severe rectal gross inflammation and troublesome mucosectomy, and consistently very long, greater than or equal to 7 cm, acute angulated, efferent conduits, and severe evacuation difficulties. Reconstruction of the pouch, with shortening of the efferent limb, was necessary for definite cure in all but one patient. The cuff abscess seemed to be either a descending infection, or an infection ascending from a disrupted anastomosis, a rupture provoked by a long, kinked efferent conduit. After introduction of the S-pouch with short spout and the J-pouch, this feared complication did not appear.\r"

  ".U": "87189501\r", 
  ".W": "A possible technical problem encountered when performing ileoanal anastomosis with reservoir is the occurrence of tension when the reservoir is drawn to the anal canal. An anatomic study was performed to assess the gain of caudad reach that can be obtained by dissection of the mesentery root and vascular divisions applied to S- and J-shaped reservoirs, in association with angiographic control of terminal ileum vascularization. The study confirms the clinical experience that caudad reach of ileal reservoirs can be critical in some cases. Complete dissection of the root of the mesentery is a poor lengthening technique, the limiting factor being tension of the superior mesenteric artery. It is simple, however, and should be performed systematically because it can provide 1 or 2 useful centimeters of caudad reach. Division of the ileocecal pedicle is a safe, reproducible, efficient lengthening procedure that can serve all types of reservoirs. In this study, it gave a 5 cm or more gain in caudad reach in 80 percent of the cases, with a slight advantage to the S-shaped reservoir. Distal division of the superior mesenteric pedicle seems more hazardous and can serve only the J-shaped reservoir. For J-shaped reservoirs, maximum caudad reach was achieved when the pouch was built over the most inferior ileal point, which should be checked prior to the procedure, not judged according to predefined measures. The angiographic study showed that, in 38 percent of the cases, cecal vessels participated in vascularization of the last centimeters of the terminal ileum by means of recurrent ileal arteries, which, in 28 percent of the cases, provided exclusive blood supply to this area. Vascularization of the terminal ileum can and should be carefully preserved.\r"

Patients with perineal drainage stayed longer in the hospital (mean, 33 days) than those with abdominal drainage (mean, 24 days) (P less than 0.004).

Two pouches have been excised, one has been defunctioned for diarrhea, and seven patients either have not had their ileostomy closed or have not been followed for more than four months after restoration of intestinal continuity. Of the remaining 22 patients, 12 early operations involved endoanal mucosectomy while in the ten most recent procedures, the rectum and anal mucosa have been excised from the abdomen. Incidence of complications between the methods of mucosal excision were comparable apart from cuff abscess (n = 5) which only occur after endoanal muscosectomy. Functional results were identical apart from the incidence of soiling which occurred in six of 12 patients after endoanal mucosectomy but in only one of ten patients after abdominal mucosectomy. Resting anal canal pressures fell significantly after endoanal mucosectomy (87 to 60cm H20, P less than 0.05) but not after abdominal mucosectomy (82 to 81 cm H20). These differences may be due to the duration and extent of anal retraction, which was 72 minutes after endoanal mucosectomy but only 18 minutes after abdominal mucosectomy. Abdominal mucosectomy appears to cause less sphincter damage and soiling than conventional endoanal excision.\r"

The nature of the hereditary transmission of Turcot syndrome is hence analyzed, discussing whether it happens through an autosomal recessive or a dominant gene. Undoubtedly the family has colonic adenomatosis, a disease considered of autosomal dominant transmission. Based on the clinical observation, the authors suggest that Turcot syndrome may be determined by an autosomal gene with a pleiotropic effect and variable expressivity.\r"

These tumors comprise less than 1% of all pancreatic tumors in a large series, and exhibit a benign course, in contrast to mucinous cystadenomas, which have a definite malignant potential. The cases here presented are middle and advanced aged women who complained of epigastric discomfort and mild weight loss. Two of them also had a palpable epigastric mass and one of them diabetes mellitus. They were treated surgically with total excision of the tumor. During surgery and thereafter no evidence of spreading beyond the pancreas was found. CT scan shows a characteristic image of PMA, which may then be confirmed by a percutaneous biopsy. If the patient is asymptomatic or a poor surgical risk, it is reasonable to rely on this evidence and follow the patient rather than operate.\r"

  ".W": "We studied in humans the effect of exogenous secretin in a physiological dose on gastric acid secretion stimulated by pentagastrin and postprandial plasma gastrin concentration. Two doses of pentagastrin, 80 and 160 pmol/kg/hr were used to stimulate gastric acid secretion. Secretin in two doses, 2.8 and 5.6 pmol/kg/hr were tried to study the response on stimulated gastric acid secretion. Intravenous secretin in a dose of 5.6 pmol/kg/hr significantly inhibited the gastric acid output stimulated by intravenous pentagastrin in a dose of 160 pmol/kg/hr, from 11.25 +/- 1.5 to 5.99 +/- 1.34 meq/hr while lower dose of intravenous secretin (2.8 pmol/kg/hr) failed to inhibit the gastric acid output stimulated by the same dose of pentagastrin. However, the lower dose of intravenous secretin (2.8 pmol/kg/hr) inhibited the gastric acid output significantly from 8.78 +/- 1.21 to 6.37 +/- 1.62 meq/hr when gastric secretion was stimulated by the lower dose of pentagastrin (80 pmol/kg/hr). The plasma concentrations of secretin during intravenous secretin in a dose of 2.8 pmol/kg/hr was similar to postprandial plasma concentrations of secretin as previously reported. Doubling the dose of intravenous secretin resulted in almost twofold higher plasma concentrations than postprandial plasma concentrations. In addition, the low dose of secretin (2.8 pmol/kg/hr) suppressed the integrated postprandial gastrin response from 13.9 +/- 3.7 to 11.2 +/- 2.8 ng/min/ml (P = 0.05) when endogenous release of secretin was blocked by intravenous cimetidine. Since the dose of pentagastrin and secretin employed in this study fell in a physiologic range, the inhibitory effect of secretin on stimulated gastric acid secretion appears to be a physiologic action in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In addition to gastric mucosal cytoprotective and antisecretory effects, prostaglandin E2 has a beneficial effect on experimental pancreatitis in some animal models, while prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as indomethacin and salicylates may induce pancreatitis at maximal doses. However, their effect on human pancreas is unclear. For this reason we considered it necessary to delineate their actions on human pancreatic secretion. Six healthy volunteers were studied on six separate days. On day 1, against a background of 1 pmol/kg/hr secretin, increasing doses of CCK were infused intravenously. On day 2, increasing doses of an amino acid mixture were infused intraduodenally and both studies were repeated on two occasions, following 100 micrograms 15(R), 15-methyl prostaglandin E2 per os on one and following indomethacin 50 mg orally 12 and 1 hr prior to the study on the other. Both indomethacin and PGE2 had no significant effect on pancreatic secretion in response to graded doses of CCK. 15(R),15-Methyl prostaglandin E2 and indomethacin caused a reduction of amylase output in response to the higher doses of intraduodenal amino acids. The prostaglandin E2 derivative also elicited a significant increase in basal bicarbonate output. In conclusion: the acute effects of 15(R),15-methyl prostaglandin E2 and indomethacin on human pancreatic secretion do not seem to offer an explanation for the mechanisms of protection against experimental acute pancreatitis or an association with pancreatitis, respectively.\r"

Basic temperature-dependence studies of NMR spectrometry (90 degrees/180 degrees radiofrequency pulse sequence) on 21 chloroform-methanol extracted pure total stool lipid standards (weight range: 0.05-1.6 g) revealed significantly (P less than 0.05) improving correlations between NMR signal amplitudes and corresponding weights at increasing temperatures (r = 0.952/40 degrees C, r = 0.965/60 degrees C, r = 0.988/80 degrees C), thus indicating 80 degrees C as optimal temperature for NMR spectrometric total stool fat quantification. In subsequent comparative measurements of lyophilized stool samples, NMR spectrometry (at 80 degrees C) and conventional chloroform-methanol extraction provided significantly (P less than 0.001) correlated results with respect to total fecal fat contents/day of quantitatively collected and homogenized stools in 93 patients with known exocrine pancreatic function (secretin-pancreozymin test), irrespective of whether correlations were determined for all 93 patients (r = 0.983) or separately for patients with normal (N = 45; r = 0.867), moderately reduced (N = 31; r = 0.946), or highly reduced (N = 17; r = 0.992) exocrine pancreatic function and correspondingly increased total fecal fat excretions.\r"

The peptide was shown to be present in all regions studied and in all three species. Exceptionally high concentrations were found in the region of the lower esophageal sphincter. Pretreatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine depleted NPY concentrations by 30-40%, indicating that NPY is colocalized in part with adrenergic nerves. Characterization of the NPY immunoreactivity by high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed a single major peak. NPY immunoreactivity derived from rat extracts eluted consistently earlier from the column than synthetic porcine standard, indicating minor species differences. Pharmacological studies using longitudinal muscle from guinea pig terminal ileum demonstrated that NPY caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the electrically stimulated, neurally mediated contraction of longitudinal smooth muscle. This suggested that NPY may act presynaptically to inhibit cholinergic transmission. The effects of various NPY fragments were also tested on the same preparation. The C-terminal fragments were active but were considerably less potent than NPY, while the free acid form of NPY and N-terminal fragment (1-19) were completely inactive. Thus, this study has demonstrated the presence of NPY in the gastrointestinal tract of various species, particularly within the lower esophageal sphincter. The pharmacological actions of the peptide suggest a role in the control of nonvascular smooth muscle tone.\r"

Exogenous PP in a dose of 100 pmol/kg/hr infused when the phase III of the MMC passed mid-jejunum raised plasma PP to the level of 130 +/- 27 pM but failed to affect the spike activity or MMC periodicity. PP given in doses of 200 and 400 pmol/kg/hr, which raised plasma PP to 298 +/- 25 and 453 +/- 24 pM, respectively, increased dose dependently (but did not abolish) the MMC intervals and an overall spike activity due to the prolongation of phase II of the MMC. After termination of PP infusion, phase III-like activity appeared within 7-10 min. Injection of highly specific PP antiserum, which caused almost complete disappearance of plasma PP both in fasted and fed dogs, did not affect the MMC interval but increased spike activity in fasted animals and failed to affect significantly spike activity in fed animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess in rat pups the influence of protein diets ingested by their mothers during gestation and lactation on the enzyme content of the pancreas of the offspring. Rat pups born of either well-nourished mothers or of mothers fed a diet moderately restricted in protein (9% casein w/w) were studied. After weaning, the pups were fed on one of three diets: a well-balanced diet, a 5% casein diet (protein restricted), or a well-balanced diet of a similar caloric value as the protein-restricted diet (pair-fed rat pups). The pups were sacrificed after intervals of one to 25 weeks after weaning. The results showed that the enzyme content of the pancreas increased progressively with time in pups born of malnourished mothers, particularly in pups fed the protein-restricted diet. This suggests prolonged maturation of the pancreas. Pups fed the 5% casein diet had a decreased amylase content per milligram of DNA but not of other enzymes. Malnutrition in the mother increased the ratio of enzymes to DNA and the total pancreatic enzyme content at different times after weaning, indicating that maternal malnutrition had a prolonged effect on the pancreatic enzyme content of the pups' pancreas. This mechanism could play a role in the pathogenesis of tropical chronic calcific pancreatitis in man and explain some of the geographic differences in the incidence of the disease.\r"

Gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying of acaloric meals with different viscosities were measured in normal dogs and after a two-thirds gastrectomy with Billroth-I or Roux-Y gastroenterostomy. After distal gastrectomy, gastric emptying depended on the viscosity of the meal, as in normal dogs. Acaloric viscous meals emptied significantly faster in the Billroth-I than in the Roux-Y group due to different contractile patterns of the duodenum and jejunum. In comparison to normal dogs, gastric emptying of viscous meals was accelerated in the Billroth-I and delayed in the Roux-Y group. Several motility parameters of the stomach and intestine differed between the normal and gastrectomized dogs. Thus, after distal gastrectomy, the viscosity of the meal and the contractile patterns of the small intestine are important determinants of gastric emptying.\r"

Gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying of acaloric and nutritive meals with different viscosities were measured in normal dogs and after a two-thirds Roux-Y gastrectomy. In gastrectomized dogs low-viscosity nutritive meals emptied unduly rapidly in an initial phase, although the frequency and spread of contractions, ie, the propulsive activity of the jejunal Roux limb were diminished. A slow emptying rate during the following period was due to a long-lasting inhibition of gastric and jejunal motility. Medium-viscosity nutritive meals emptied in gastrectomized dogs as slowly as in normal animals, but this effect was primarily caused by the meal viscosity and only secondarily by the nutrients. It is concluded that following Roux-Y gastrectomy a regulation of gastric emptying is preserved; however, the onset of an effective control is delayed, resulting in a rapid initial emptying of low-viscosity meals.\r"

Therefore, 95 healthy volunteers (mean age: 43 years; range 22-79 years) were studied with a low-compliance infusion system and 4.5-mm-diameter catheter. All subjects were given 10 wet swallows (5 cc H2O) and 38 subjects also were given 10 dry swallows. Results: Amplitude, but not duration, was greater (P less than 0.05) after wet compared to dry swallows. Both distal mean contractile amplitude and duration of wet swallows significantly increased with age and peaked in the fifties. Double-peaked waves frequently occurred after both wet (11.3%) and dry (18.1%) swallows, but triple-peaked waves were rare (less than 1%). Nonperistaltic contractions were more common (P less than 0.001) after dry compared to wet swallows (18.1% vs 4.1%). This difference resulted from frequent simultaneous contractions after dry swallows (12.6% vs 0.4%). Conclusions: Distal esophageal contractile amplitude and duration after wet swallows increases with age. Triple-peaked waves and wet-swallow-induced simultaneous contractions should suggest an esophageal motility disorder. Double-peaked waves are a common variant of normal. Dry swallows have little use in the current evaluation of esophageal peristalsis.\r"

  ".W": "Saliva has received recent attention because of its potential role in esophageal clearance and neutralization of refluxed gastric contents. Gastric antisecretory drugs or promotility drugs used to treat reflux have not been studied for their ability to affect salivary function. We conducted a double-blind randomized study of four antisecretory drugs, two promotility drugs, and placebo (PL) on 12 healthy volunteers on seven different days. Following a 6-hr fast, accumulated saliva was expectorated at least once per minute. The initial 10-min sample was discarded and a baseline 20-min sample collected. One of the following was given per os: PL, pirenzepine (PIR), 50 mg; propantheline (PRO), 30 mg; cimetidine (CIM), 300 mg; ranitidine (RAN), 150 mg; bethanechol (BET), 25 mg; or metoclopramide (MET), 10 mg. Saliva was collected for 60 min. Saliva was then stimulated (STIM) by sucking a peppermint lozenge for 30 min. Specimens were collected under oil, kept on ice, and analyzed within 30 min. Saliva flow in milliliters per minute and capacity for acid neutralization (CAN) in microequivalents acid per milliliter saliva were analyzed on all samples. The known effect of PRO to inhibit both basal saliva flow and STIM flow and CAN was seen. In contrast, the selective antimuscarinic PIR did not significantly decrease saliva flow or CAN. CIM, RAN, and MET did not significantly effect salivary function, but both CIM and RAN showed a tendency to increase CAN. Oral BET had no detectable effect on salivary function.\r"

  ".W": "Whether gallbladder absorptive function is altered during formation of cholesterol gallstones is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that alterations in biliary lipid composition present during early cholesterol gallstone formation enhance gallbladder absorption, as manifested by an increase in the ratio of gallbladder to hepatic bile lipid concentrations. Prairie dogs received either control or a 0.4% cholesterol-enriched chow for two or six weeks. The bile acid pool of each animal was labeled with [14C]cholic acid. Gallbladder and hepatic bile were analyzed for lipid composition with calculation of indices for cholesterol saturation, gallbladder stasis, and gallbladder absorption. Animals maintained on cholesterol-enriched chow for two weeks had a significant increase, as compared to controls, in the ratio of gallbladder to hepatic bile concentrations of cholesterol (8.66 +/- 1.09 vs 5.76 +/- 0.48), phospholipids (4.76 +/- 0.42 vs 3.21 +/- 0.34), bile acids (6.42 +/- 2.20 vs 3.54 +/- 0.46), and total lipid content (6.22 +/- 0.94 vs 3.64 +/- 0.43). These changes occurred at a time when gallbladder stasis is present and cholesterol crystals are forming, but prior to stone formation. Similar findings were noted in six-week cholesterol-fed prairie dogs. We propose the uniformly increased ratios of biliary lipids result from enhanced gallbladder absorption of water and sodium. The resulting increase in solute concentration may promote nucleation and, therefore, may be an important etiologic factor in cholesterol gallstone formation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cefoperazone, a third-generation cephalosporin, on biliary lipid secretion in rats was examined. Rats were anesthetized with ether and the mid-lumbar vein and common bile duct cannulated. Bile acid secretion was maintained by intravenous taurocholic acid infusion (28 mumol/hr). A 1-hr control period was followed by intravenous cefoperazone infusion at either submaximal (20 mumol/hr), or supramaximal (60 mumol/hr) concentrations. At the cefoperazone infusion rate of 20 mumol/hr (biliary secretion of 7.1 +/- 1.6 mumol/hr) phospholipid secretion fell 19% and cholesterol secretion fell 31%; at a cefoperazone infusion rate of 60 mumol/hr (biliary secretion rate of 27.1 +/- 5.1 mumol/hr) phospholipid and cholesterol secretion were further reduced 40% and 56%, respectively, of controls. All changes were significant (P less than 0.01). Inhibition of both cholesterol and phospholipid secretion paralleled each other, was dose-dependent, and reversible. Cefoperazone's inhibitory action was abolished at a bile acid infusion rate of 108 mumol/hr. Cefoperazone was not found to be associated with bile acid micelles or mixed micelles as determined by ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. Thus, the effect of cefoperazone on biliary lipid secretion is not due to the impairment of mixed micelle formation in the canalicular lumen but rather its inhibitory effect appears to be due to a presecretory event.\r"

The results indicate that in iron-overloaded animals: liver iron excess was major (maximal liver iron concentration values of 42 mumol/100 mg dry weight for both animals vs 1.3 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SD) in controls) and chronic (for 15 months liver iron concentrations were higher than 15); iron deposition, although less abundant than in sinusoidal cells, was pronounced within parenchymal cells; serum transaminase activities were markedly increased; rare foci of perisinusoidal fibrosis were observed in areas of massive iron overload; and a dramatic decrease in hepatic 4-prolyl-hydroxylase activity was found, in contrast with unchanged glucosyltransferase and galactosyltransferase activities. In conclusion these findings suggest that, in our model, chronic liver iron overload: exerts a marked biochemical cytolytic effect; and does not produce significant hepatic fibrosis, possibly related to an inhibiting effect of ferric nitrilotriacetate complex on 4-prolyl-hydroxylase activity.\r"

Oral administration of loperamide (0.1 mg/kg) induced, after a delay of 20-30 min, a long-lasting (8-12 hr) stimulation of gastrointestinal motility associated with a disorganization of the cyclic activity at the three levels investigated. These effects were reproduced by a subcutaneous administration at the same dose and were antagonized by previous intravenous administration of naloxone or a quaternary opiate antagonist. Intracolonic administration (0.1 mg/kg) stimulated, after a delay of 20-30 min, colonic motility only. Intracerebroventricular loperamide (1 microgram/kg) induced a long-lasting (15-20 hr) inhibition of the gastric motility and a short (2-hr) disorganization of the jejunal motor profile. These data show that oral loperamide stimulates gastrointestinal motility in dogs and involves peripheral opiate receptors.\r"

A vibrameter and a biothesiometer were used at four sites and at differing pressures. In normal subjects, with the vibrameter at 200 g, mean VST +/- SE for all sites was 1.87 micron +/- 0.22 and at 400 g dropped to 1.08 micron +/- 0.15 (P less than .0001). In 20 of these subjects with a biothesiometer at 200 and 400 g, mean VST fell from 12.8 +/- 1.5 to 11.1 +/- 1.1 (arbitrary units) (P = .01) when the greater pressure was applied. In the 8 subjects with peripheral neuropathy, with the vibrameter at 200 and 400 g, respectively, mean VST fell from 70.7 +/- 26 to 7.2 +/- 1.8. VST in these subjects was estimated again after 1 mo and showed strong correlations with the previous values. Biothesiometer results correlated with vibrameter results at all sites. Thus, VST decreases as the pressure of the applied stimulus is increased and this effect appears to be more marked in peripheral neuropathy. This has important consequences in monitoring this condition.\r"

There was no difference in the diastolic blood pressure between these two groups. The correlation between blood pressure and the components of retinopathy (including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates) was also analyzed. Even when the patient with microaneurysms or dot hemorrhages, blot hemorrhages, or hard or soft exudates were separately evaluated, systolic and pulse blood pressures were higher in those with one of these diabetic changes than in patients without them. To avoid the influence of nephropathy, the patients were divided into nonproteinuric or proteinuric groups. In the nonproteinuric group, pulse blood pressure was higher in patients with retinopathy than in those without. In the proteinuric group, systolic blood pressure was also higher in patients with retinopathy than in those without. However, these observed differences in blood pressure were slight after the division of the patients. With respect to the components of retinopathy, systolic and pulse blood pressures were significantly higher in the patient with blot hemorrhages than in those without in both nonproteinuric and proteinuric groups (nonproteinuric: systolic pressure 142 vs. 137 mmHg, P less than .005, and pulse pressure 60.4 vs. 55.5 mmHg, P less than .001; proteinuric: systolic pressure 155 vs. 146 mmHg, P less than 0.01, and pulse pressure 69.0 vs. 63.5 mmHg, P less than .05).\r"

Another group of 10 adult subjects with comparable foot lesions (all with retinopathy, 9 with symptomatic neuropathy, and 4 with macroangiopathy) was treated in exactly the same way except for HBO. In the test treatment group, 16 patients were healed, and the remaining 2 showed no improvement and later underwent amputation. The number of HBO treatments required for healing was significantly related to the size of gangrenous lesions. In the non-HBO-treated group, only 1 patient improved, 5 of 10 showed no change, and 4 of 10 worsened until leg amputation was unavoidable. Comparison of the two groups by chi 2-test revealed a highly significant difference (P = .001).

A change in the serum phenytoin concentration of +/- 4 micrograms/ml was considered clinically significant; by this definition four patients (14.8 percent) had an increase, two (7.4 percent) had a decrease, and most (77.8 percent) demonstrated no change. The mean difference was 0.8 microgram/ml +/- 3.7 micrograms/ml and was not found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.1). Clinically important alterations in phenytoin serum concentration as caused by thioridazine appear to be infrequent.\r"

The application of dosing methods utilizing first-dose pharmacokinetics has been advocated as a means for rapidly attaining therapeutic serum concentrations. Review of ten cystic fibrosis patients between ages 13 and 33 years admitted for exacerbation of pulmonary disease caused primarily by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Staphylococcus aureus in two patients) was conducted. Elimination rate constant (ke, h-1) was calculated from two concentration-time pairs obtained following the first dose. Two concentration-time pairs were again measured between cumulative doses (n) 7 to 19, and ke was calculated. First dose ke varied significantly from nth dose ke (p = 0.018). First-dose pharmacokinetic analysis may not be a reliable predictor of maintenance tobramycin dosage requirements due to apparent changes in ke over time.\r"

Plasma clindamycin concentrations were determined periodically for eight hours after achieving steady state. The results indicate that treatment C yielded significantly higher peak plasma clindamycin concentrations than treatments A or B. There were no significant differences in minimum plasma clindamycin concentrations (Cmin) or area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC24) between treatments A and C. However, both treatments A and C yielded significantly greater Cmin and AUC24 values than treatment B. There were no significant differences among treatments for clindamycin clearance. It is concluded that clindamycin phosphate 900 mg q8h is a pharmacokinetically acceptable alternative to clindamycin phosphate 600 mg q6h.\r"

Their ages ranged from 21 to 81 years, with nine subjects over 70 years old. Esophageal transit time of liquids was measured in all subjects after which the esophageal transit time of a #00 gelatin capsule containing technetium (99mTc) sulfur colloid was measured with a 120 ml and a 15 ml water bolus. The capsule lodged in three subjects (17 percent) with the 120 ml bolus and in 11 subjects (61 percent) with the 15 ml bolus. Esophageal manometry demonstrated a lower mean amplitude of esophageal contractions in subjects in whom the capsule lodged with the 120 ml bolus and in the elderly subjects. We conclude that the esophageal transit time of a gelatin capsule is related to the volume of fluid chaser. Our findings that a lower amplitude of esophageal contractions was associated with elderly patients and those in whom the capsule lodged with the large fluid bolus are worthy of further investigation.\r"

With the addition of hetastarch 6% to the formulary, an alternative colloid was available that could be therapeutically substituted for albumin 5% at a cost savings. Its usage, however, was not what would have been expected. Usage information was obtained by placing utilization forms inside the individual boxes of albumin 5% and hetastarch 6%. These forms were completed by the anesthesiologists and returned to the pharmacy, where the remainder of each form was completed. It was concluded that 93 percent of the patients administered albumin 5% could have received hetastarch 6%. Hence, potential yearly savings of approximately $12,346.00 could be realized by the Department of Pharmacy.\r"

Patients older than three years were asked to describe their pain by means of a pictorial or a visual analog scale. Pain was assessed by the investigator, parent, or nurse caring for the patient as well as the patient whenever possible before each dose and 10, 30, and 60 minutes after the first three doses each day for four days. Stomatitis severity was graded daily. Four patients completed the study protocol; an additional three patients dropped out of the study due to severe stinging when benzydamine oral rinse was administered. The case histories of the patients who completed the study are presented. Both preparations reduced pain for at least one hour in most instances but not for two hours. Three of four patients elected to continue treatment with HSC mouthwash for pain.

One of the commonly prescribed compounds within this class of drugs is thioridazine, available both as a generic product as well as the innovator product, Mellaril. Each of these products is coded as bioequivalent and consequently therapeutically equivalent by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A recent issue of this journal contained an article that raised a number of questions concerning the bioequivalence of the generic versions of thioridazine that have been approved by the FDA. Their article was based in part on information obtained from the FDA as well as information supplied to the authors by Sandoz, Inc., the manufacturer of the original thioridazine drug product Mellaril. The FDA has reviewed its original decision of bioequivalence. Based on this reassessment, the FDA strongly rejects the assertion by the authors that several of the approved generic thioridazine products are not bioequivalent. The rationale behind the FDA decisions and the FDA's viewpoint on the bioequivalence of generic thioridazine drug products is discussed in detail.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine the long term effects of surgical trauma on plasma beta-endorphin dynamics. Blood samples for RIA were obtained from female baboons every 4 h for three 48-h periods: one beginning 1 week before surgical trauma, the second 30 min after surgical trauma, and the third 1 week after surgical trauma. Animals were subjected to laparotomy and 30-min anesthesia (n = 8), 5-min surgical trauma under 30-min anesthesia (low trauma; n = 8), or 20-min surgical trauma under 30-min anesthesia (high trauma; n = 8). Computer analysis of beta-endorphin levels as a function of clock time demonstrated a true preoperative circadian rhythm for all animals, with a mean of 87.9 pg/ml. In the immediate 48-h postoperative period, a postoperative alteration in circadian beta-endorphin dynamics occurred that was correlated with the severity of trauma. A disruption of circadian rhythms of plasma beta-endorphin occurred in the high trauma group only, in which it persisted for longer than 1 week after trauma. These studies establish a relationship between the alteration of circadian rhythmicity of plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity and the magnitude of trauma and injury.\r"

  ".U": "87190055\r", 
  ".W": "With advancing age, 60-80% of the follicles of the mouse thyroid gland turn \"cold\", i.e. they lose their normal capacity to iodinate thyroglobulin (Tgb). Cold follicles are morphologically characterized by their large size, by deeply periodic acid-Schiff-stained colloid and by flat epithelial cells. We investigated the hypothesis that a progressive, age-related failure of endocytosis, leading to a gradually increasing mismatch between production of new Tgb and resorption of stored Tgb, could lead to overfilling of colloid stores with consecutive impediment of diffusion. To this purpose, labeling of the thyroids was started when mice were 3 months old, and 125I was continuously administered thereafter for 2-6 months. After this time, all follicles were homogeneously labeled in autoradiographs. Tracer application was then discontinued. Autoradiographs obtained at intervals during the washout of the tracer yielded a mirror image of that observed after acute labeling. The large follicles which were cold after acute labeling in old animals now still retained labeled iodoproteins even after 7 weeks of washout, i.e. at a time when morphologically normal follicles had long lost their labeled Tgb stores. Thus, the cold follicles of the old thyroid must have been functioning normally during equilibration of young thyroids, but have then gradually lost their capacity to iodinate and to remove stored Tgb from the colloid. The observation supports the thesis that aging primarily affects the cytoskeleton and, thus, the cell's endocytotic machinery. This effect of aging on the thyroid can be prevented by life-long stimulation of the gland by TSH.\r"

GH secretion increased within 3 min after GABA administration with a peak response at 5-6 min. The lowest effective dose of the GABA agonist muscimol was about 10 times smaller than that of GABA. The GABA effect was antagonized by picrotoxin and bicuculline, suggesting that GABA acts at GABA-A type receptors. The pituitary responsiveness to GABA gradually decreased during the second and third postnatal weeks. If the neonatal pituitaries were continuously exposed to GABA for 3 h GH secretion rapidly increased to a maximum within the first 10 min and then gradually decreased to a less elevated level by 1 h and remained at this level for the next 2 h. After 3 h of GABA exposure muscimol had no effect on GH secretion but human pancreatic GH-releasing factor stimulated it, indicating receptor desensitization during prolonged GABA administration. The significance of GABAergic regulation of GH secretion in the neonate is emphasized by the finding that simultaneous administration of picrotoxin diminished the GH releasing activity of the hypothalamic extract of 2-day-old rats by more than 60%. These results indicate that in the postnatal period the regulation of GH secretion differs from that of the adult animal and GABA might play an important role in the maintenance of the high GH secretion during the first days of life.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of GH administration to hypophysectomized rats on expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the liver and kidney was examined. In both tissues maximal expression of c-myc occurred by 1 h after a single injection of human GH (100 micrograms/100 g bw). In the liver the maximal c-myc mRNA level was increased 12 +/- 3.9-fold (mean +/- SEM; n = 4), while the maximal c-myc level in the kidney was increased 3.4-fold (n = 2) compared to levels in basal hypophysectomized rats. In both the liver and kidney the IGF-I cDNA hybridized under stringent conditions to three transcripts with apparent sizes of 7.0, 1.8, and diffuse group of transcripts of 0.7-1.1 kilobases. Each of these transcripts demonstrated some degree of GH dependence. Under the hybridization condition used, the 7.0-kilobase IGF-I mRNA was virtually undetectable in the hypophysectomized control rat liver, while the smaller transcripts were easily detectable. Peak expression of each of the IGF-I transcripts occurred 6-12 h after GH administration. Maximal IGF-I expression in the kidney occurred 9 h after the GH injection. To determine whether the increase in c-myc expression following GH could result from a small but undetectable increase in IGF-I expression in these tissues, we administered human recombinant IGF-I to hypophysectomized rats (50 micrograms/100 g bw, ip). Despite a significant increase in serum IGF-I concentrations to levels greater than those present in the first 3 h after GH administration, no increase in c-myc expression was apparent in either the liver or kidney. These observations suggest that GH itself, rather than IGF-I, initiates the mitogenic response in the liver and kidney that follows GH administration to hypophysectomized rats.\r"

In this study we examined lipid metabolism associated with the fusion and activation of alveolar macrophages induced by 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3. Treatment of alveolar macrophages with 12 nM 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h caused a marked increase in incorporation of [14C]acetic acid and [14C]oleic acid into triacylglycerol. The macrophages treated with the vitamin began to fuse and show cytotoxicity at 48 h, whereas incorporation of the radioactive compounds into triacylglycerol started as early as 12 h after 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 was added. The triacylglycerol synthesis induced by 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 was greatly increased when 14C-labeled unsaturated fatty acids were used as tracers compared with 14C-labeled saturated fatty acids. The activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which catalyzes the last step of the three acylations in triacylglycerol synthesis, was significantly higher in the macrophages treated with 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 than in the control macrophages. Like 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3, retinoic acid and lypopolysaccharides also activated alveolar macrophages, but not induce any fusion. The activated macrophages cultured with retinoic acid or lypopolysaccharides also induced synthesis of triacylglycerol. These results indicate that 1 alpha, 25-(OH)2D3 induces the synthesis of triacylglycerol by preferentially incorporating unsaturated fatty acids into diacylglycerol, and that the alteration of lipid metabolism is related to the activation, rather than the fusion, of alveolar macrophages.\r"

Singleton fetuses were either hypophysectomized (n = 14) or sham operated (n = 8) between days 110 and 125. Fetal and maternal blood samples were collected three times weekly through the remainder of gestation. In some hypophysectomized fetuses (HXT4 group, n = 4), T4 was administered (100 micrograms L-T4/day) to overcome the hypothyroidism caused by hypophysectomy. The other hypophysectomized fetuses received no replacement therapy (HXNR group, n = 10). Six HXNR fetuses were allowed to remain in utero post term and were killed at day 163 of gestation. All other animals were killed at day 147. All values are group means +/- SE. Hypophysectomized fetuses had significantly shorter limbs and long bones and delayed osseous maturation at term compared to sham controls. Plasma free T4 concentrations in HXT4 fetuses were not significantly different from those measured in sham fetuses (P greater than 0.05). Bone maturation at term was normal in HXT4 fetuses although there was no improvement in limb or bone elongation. Retention of hypophysectomized fetuses in utero until 16 days past term yielded fetuses which were heavier than controls but whose limb and bone lengths were no greater than hypophysectomized fetuses killed at term. Osseous maturation was appropriate for term in five of the six postterm hypophysectomized fetuses. The plasma IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations were not significantly affected by hypophysectomy, hypophysectomy with T4 replacement, gestational age, or prolonged gestation. The plasma IGF-I concentrations in the sham, HXNR, and HXT4 fetuses were 35.4 +/- 6.6, 28.2 +/- 3.0, and 34.4 +/- 1.7 ngeq human (h)IGF-I/ml, and the IGF-II concentrations were 656.3 +/- 59.2, 635.3 +/- 56.3, and 645.5 +/- 71.9 ngeq hIGF-II/ml, respectively, and remained within these ranges throughout the experiment. Fetal IGF-I concentrations were significantly lower than mean maternal IGF-I concentrations (88.0 +/- 6.8 ngeq hIGF-I/ml, P less than 0.05), and fetal IGF-II concentrations were significantly higher than mean maternal IGF-II concentrations (362.4 +/- 24.0 ngeq hIGF-II/ml, P less than 0.05). We conclude that in the late gestation fetal sheep, elongation of the appendicular skeleton is under some direct pituitary control whereas appendicular maturation exhibits some dependence on circulating T4 concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

While vascular PRL does not cross this barrier, it is readily accessible to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from which it may gain access to the PRL-responsive areas of the brain. Studies were undertaken to characterize the mechanism responsible for the translocation of PRL from blood to CSF. Rats were given external jugular vein injections of [125-I]iodo-PRL in the presence or absence of an excess of unlabeled ovine PRL (oPRL), human GH, bovine GH, or porcine insulin. CSF and choroid plexus were removed 60 min later. CSF samples were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels and resultant autoradiographs were analyzed with quantitative microdensitometry. The data revealed that unlabeled lactogenic hormones, viz. oPRL and human GH, caused a statistically significant inhibition of [125I]iodo-PRL transport from blood to CSF. In contrast, nonlactogenic hormones, viz bovine GH and insulin, had no effect on [125I]iodo-PRL transport into the CSF. An identical pattern of competition was observed in the binding of hormone to the choroid plexus. Furthermore, vascular injections of [125I]iodo-PRL administered with a range of concentrations of unlabeled oPRL revealed a dose-response inhibition in the transport of [125I]iodo-PRL from blood to CSF. The study demonstrates that PRL enters the CSF by a specific, PRL receptor-mediated transport mechanism. The data is consistent with the hypothesis that the transport mechanism resides at the choroid plexus. The existence of this transport mechanism reflects the importance of the cerebroventricular system in PRL-brain interactions.\r"

Using monoclonal estrogen receptor antibodies, we have now obtained direct evidence that these matrix-associated estradiol-binding sites are estrogen receptor proteins similar to those found in the cytosol before estrogen treatment. Proteins of the liver nuclear matrix from untreated or ethinyl estradiol-treated female rats were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed with the monoclonal estrogen receptor antibody H222Sp gamma. A single prominent immunoreactive 67,000 mol wt band, indicating the presence of estrogen receptors, was found in the liver nuclear matrix of estrogen-treated animals. This band was detectable, but of much lower intensity, in the liver nuclear matrix of untreated animals. Liver cytosol estrogen receptor from untreated rats also migrated as a 67,000 mol wt band. These immunoreactivity data corroborated data obtained by [3H]estradiol-binding assays. Scatchard analysis of specific high affinity [3H]estradiol-binding sites showed high levels of these sites in the liver nuclear matrix of estrogen-treated rats and low levels in untreated rats. Therefore, both direct and indirect methods of receptor identification demonstrate the specific association of estrogen receptors with the nuclear matrix after estrogen treatment in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] stimulates muscle Ca uptake through a nuclear mechanism. The possibility that 1,25-(OH)2D3 would induce rapid changes in muscle Ca fluxes independent of de novo protein synthesis was investigated in the present work. In vitro preparations of soleus muscles obtained from vitamin D-deficient chicks were used. A significant increase in 45Ca labeling of the tissue was already observed after 3-min treatment with 2.4 X 10(-10) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. This early stimulation in muscle Ca uptake became maximal at 10-15 min. Cycloheximide (50 microM) did not block the effect of the metabolite at 15 and 30 min. However, the antibiotic effectively blocked the increase in Ca uptake induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 after 1-h treatment. The rapid 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent stimulation of 45Ca labeling of soleus muscle was not associated to changes in lipid synthesis as assessed by measurements of 3H-glycerol incorporation into the tissue lipids. However, the calcium antagonists verapamil and nifedipine (50 microM) abolished the stimulation in Ca uptake produced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in 5 min. These results suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 can act directly at the muscle membrane level affecting Ca fluxes through Ca channels.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether there are structural differences between the binding sites for placental lactogen (PL) and GH, we have compared the molecular weights of complexes formed by the covalent cross-linking of [125I]ovine (o) PL and [125I]oGH to hepatic membranes from fetal and pregnant sheep in mid- and late gestation and from postnatal nonpregnant sheep at 3 days to 7 months of age. Specific [125I]oPL binding sites in fetal liver were detected as early as midgestation, and cross-linking of [125I]oPL to fetal hepatic membranes yielded a major radiographic band with a mol wt of 60 +/- 5 K (mean +/- SD). Unlabeled oPL at low concentrations (0.9-9 nM) specifically competed with [125I]oPL for binding to the 60 K complex. In contrast, oGH and oPRL competed for binding to the 60 K complex only at much higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 90 nM). In addition, no specific cross-linking of [125I]oGH or [125I]oPRL to fetal hepatic membranes was observed. These findings suggest the presence of a distinct and unique PL binding site in ovine fetal liver. Since the mol wt of oPL is 22 K, the estimated mol wt of the oPL receptor protein is 38 +/- 5 K. During the first week after birth, there was a striking increase in the number of [125I]oGH binding sites. Cross-linking of [125I]oGH to postnatal liver yielded radiographic bands with apparent mol wts of 75 K and 140 K. The relative potencies of oPL, oGH, and oPRL in competing for binding to the 75 K and 140 K complexes were similar to the relative potencies of these hormones in competing for [125I]oGH binding sites in postnatal liver, suggesting that the 75 K and 140 K bands represent subunits of the oGH receptor bound covalently to [125I]oGH. Cross-linking of [125I]oPL to pregnant and postnatal nonpregnant liver yielded three radiographic bands with mol wts of 60 K, 75 K, and 140 K. The intensities of all three bands were reduced by low concentrations (0.9-9 nM) of oPL. Higher concentrations of oGH abolished the 75 K and 140 K bands but reduced the intensity of the 60 K band by only 20-30%. oPRL had minimal effect on band intensities. These observations suggest the presence of two functionally and structurally distinct receptors in pregnant liver: the oPL receptor, which has high affinity for oPL and low affinity for oGH and oPRL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

T4 and T3 increased alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The minimal effective T4 and T3 concentrations in medium containing 10% thyroid hormone-depleted fetal calf serum were 10(-8) M (free T4, 8 X 10(-11) M) and 10(-9) M (free T3, 4 X 10(-11) M), respectively. ROS 17/2.8 cells possessed high affinity, low capacity nuclear receptors specific for T3 [dissociation constant (Kd) approximately 150 pM; maximal binding capacity, approximately 2000 T3 binding sites per nucleus]. The relative affinity of T3, T4, rT3, MIT, and DIT were in good agreement with their biological activity. These findings suggest that rat osteoblast-like cells contain T3 nuclear receptors and that alkaline phosphatase activity is stimulated by thyroid hormone via a nuclear receptor-mediated process at free thyroid hormone concentrations attainable in patients with Graves' disease.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms involved in the proliferative response of the uterus to estrogen are poorly understood. The c-myc proto-oncogene has recently been shown to be rapidly activated in quiescent cells exposed to various mitogens. We have examined expression of c-myc and a closely related proto-oncogene, N-myc, in the rat uterus after in vivo administration of 17beta-estradiol (E2), 5 micrograms/100 g body weight, to prepubertal ovariectomized rats. Maximal c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) accumulation, as determined by densitometric analysis of Northern blots of poly (A)+ uterine RNA was observed 3 h after E2 treatment. Maximal expression of c-myc was 8.6 +/- 0.8-fold (mean +/- SEM for 3 separate experiments) compared to basal levels seen in vehicle-treated ovariectomized rats. The maximal level of c-myc mRNA in the E2-stimulated uterus was higher (3- to 6-fold) than that observed in uteri from intact rats in either diestrous or the proestrous-estrous stages of the estrous cycle. There was no significant difference in the level of uterine c-myc mRNA throughout the estrous cycle. Under stringent conditions, the N-myc DNA probe hybridized with a single 3 kilobase (kb) transcript which was virtually undetectable in ovariectomized rat uteri and increased 6-fold within 15 min after E2 treatment. Maximal induction was seen 30-60 min post E2 treatment. At 1 h post E2 the level of N-myc mRNA was 9.3 +/- 0.4-fold (n = 3) compared to vehicle-treated rats. Under conditions of slightly reduced stringency, N-myc DNA also hybridized with a 2.2 kilobase transcript. Expression of the N-myc related gene also occurred more rapidly after E2 administration than c-myc mRNA. Our in vivo data are analogous to the in vitro observations that mitogen stimulation of quiescent cells results in a rapid accumulation of myc proto-oncogene mRNAs. In cycling cells in vitro and in the uterus of intact rats throughout the estrous cycle, the level of expression of the myc oncogenes is relatively constant. Since expression of the c-myc and N-myc proto-oncogenes appears to be restricted to different cell and tissue types our data indicate that there is at least one cell type present in the quiescent uterus that is able to respond rapidly to E2. The rapidity of the N-myc response would argue for a direct effect of E2. In contrast the c-myc response is considerably delayed and may be mediated via autocrine, paracrine, or circulating estrogen-dependent growth factors.\r"

In view of the fact that alpha 1-adrenergic action is mediated by the phosphatidylinositol pathway of hormone action in many cells, we examined the hypothesis that alpha-adrenergic agonists stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cardiomyocytes and that this effect is sensitive to pertussis toxin. Addition of norepinephrine to cultured rat ventricular myocytes prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol resulted in rapid and significant accumulation of inositol phosphate (IP1) and inositol biphosphate. Norepinephrine-stimulated IP1 formation was not inhibited by propranolol, but was inhibited by alpha-adrenergic antagonists with an order of potency indicating alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subselectivity: prazosin (alpha 1; 3 nM) greater than yohimbine (alpha 2; 10 microM). The effect of norepinephrine to enhance IP1 formation was markedly attenuated in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin also induced the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to a 41,000-dalton membrane protein in these cells. The concentration of pertussis toxin resulting in maximal inhibition of norepinephrine-stimulated IP1 formation correlated well with the concentration of pertussis toxin necessary to completely ADP-ribosylate a 41,000-dalton membrane protein (1 ng/ml). The range over which pertussis toxin inhibited norepinephrine-dependent IP1 formation and ADP-ribosylated the 41,000-dalton substrate was virtually identical. These observations establish a role for a 41,000-dalton pertussis toxin substrate in coupling the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor to phosphoinositol hydrolysis in myocardial cells.\r"

The tumors also secrete rIGF-II into the circulation, resulting in plasma rIGF-II concentrations many-fold greater than those in control rodents (81 +/- 19 vs. less than 10 ng/ml, rats; 159 +/- 28 vs. 18 +/- 5 ng/ml, mice; P less than 0.05, both groups). There was no significant difference between the tumor-bearing and control rodents in either body weight or tail length. The tumor-bearing rodents did have significantly lower concentrations of IGF-I (296 +/- 23 vs. 527 +/- 67 ng/ml, rats; 300 +/- 26 vs. 482 +/- 70 ng/ml, mice; P less than 0.05, both groups), suggesting that the increased concentrations of rIGF-II may have inhibited IGF-I production or secretion. This animal model may be used to explore the biological effects of increased plasma IGF-II concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "The time sequence of the metabolism of [4-14C] pregnenolone to testosterone in homogenates of human and rat testis was studied with special emphasis on the chain of events in the early 15 min of incubation. The incubations were performed at 32 C in the presence of NAD and a NADPH-generating system. The various intermediate steroids were separated by means of HPLC using a silica aliphatic diol column. Correction for procedural losses was performed by dual labeling. The present study confirms earlier reported results which showed that in the rat metabolism of pregnenolone to testosterone proceeds via the delta 4 pathway. However, this discloses for the first time that the conversion of pregnenolone proceeds very fast: progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone as the only important delta 5 intermediate, peak and decline again to almost undetectable levels within the first 15 min of incubation. Androstenedione and testosterone start to accumulate from 1 min on under the conditions used. In contrast, in the human testis, homogenates metabolism of pregnenolone to testosterone proceeds comparatively slowly and almost exclusively via the delta 5 intermediates dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenediol. Testosterone makes its appearance only after about 8 min of incubation. The data illustrate the importance of short-term incubations in evaluating the metabolism of steroids.\r"

When homogenates of either cell type were prepared in low salt buffer, incubated at 0 C with [3H]dihydrotestosterone, chromatographed on DNA-Sepharose, and eluted with a NaCl gradient, the receptor complex was eluted at 25 mM NaCl (peak A). After incubation of the homogenate at 25 C for 20 min, peak A decreased in amplitude. The major peak of the receptor from human fibroblasts eluted at 100 mM NaCl, while that from L-cells eluted at 170 mM NaCl (peak B). Flow-through fractions contained only minimal amounts of transformable dihydrotestosterone-receptor complex under the same conditions. Furthermore, isolated peak A could be converted to peak B by the same warming process. The appearance of peak B was prevented when 10 mM, but not 1 mM, sodium molybdate was present during the homogenization process. Unoccupied receptor was recovered exclusively in peak A both at 0 C and after incubation at 25 C. When intact fibroblast and L-cell monolayers were incubated with [3H]dihydrotestosterone at 37 C, all receptor in both cytosol and nuclear extract was recovered in peak B. In sucrose density gradient centrifugation, peak A was 6-8S in size, and peak B was 4.6S. These findings suggest that peak A corresponds to the nontransformed and peak B to the transformed states of the androgen receptor; the transformation reaction may be the consequence of a dissociation of a macromolecular complex into subunits; and sodium molybdate acts to stabilize the macromolecular complex.\r"

  ".W": "To increase our knowledge of the molecular details of peptide hormone action, a specific immunogold staining procedure for the ultrastructural localization of cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory (RI) and catalytic (C) subunits was used in Y-1 adrenal cortical tumor cells. The Y-1 adrenal cell responds to ACTH (40 mU/ml) with a decrease in cell division and an increase in steroid production. Corresponding to the decrease in rate of cell division and the increase in steroid production, there was a 2-fold increase in both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of the C subunit after 60-min ACTH (40 mU/ml) treatment of the culture. The amount of immunogold staining in the adrenal tumor cells after localization with antiserum of the RI subunit decreased after 60-min ACTH (40 mU/ml) stimulation. A 2-fold decrease in labeling in the cytoplasm and nucleus was observed for the RI subunit. The loss of RI subunit from the soluble fraction of the cytoplasm of the cell or an alteration of this RI subunit is suggested by this investigation. Since there was no increase in the RI subunit in the nuclear compartment, a loss of RI subunit from the cytoplasm into the nucleus seems unlikely. The observed immunogold changes in the C subunit after ACTH treatment correspond to the reported changes observed with light microscopic techniques with a fluorescein-coupled inhibitor as a probe for the localization of free C. The immunogold technique allows for the ultra-structural identification and quantification of nuclear as well as the cytoplasmic sites of cAMP-dependent protein kinase after hormonal stimulation. These results support the proposed role of protein kinase as a mediator of the ACTH response.\r"

  ".U": "87190083\r", 
  ".W": "A supranormal rate of growth in intact, prepubertal, 26-day-old female rats was evoked by administration of large doses of highly purified rat GH (rGH). In response to daily doses of 1 and 5 mg/rat (13.6 mg/kg BW and 68 mg/kg BW), sc, for 20 days, body weight (BW) gain increased 51% and 73%, and skeletal growth increased 27% and 40%, respectively. Serum rGH in treated rats rose as much as 69-fold greater than that of controls. Feed efficiency, the ratio of weight gained to feed consumed, increased from 19.8% to 32.0%. This rGH treatment depleted pituitary GH content as much as 58% and caused hepatomegaly. These effects, as well as the accelerated growth rate, reverted to normal after cessation of rGH treatment. Onset of puberty in rGH-treated rats was delayed an average of 2.7 days. A similar stimulatory effect on BW gain, but not skeletal growth, as well as depletion of pituitary GH content, and hepatomegaly, was elicited by rGH treatment in adult, plateaued female rats. These effects in plateaued rats reverted to normal after cessation of GH treatment, and 50% of the body weight gain was rapidly lost. The largest dose of rGH used, 5 mg/day, was apparently toxic, resulting in a 20% higher mortality rate in treated prepubertal and plateaued female rats. Antibody formation was not the cause of the toxicity, since antibodies against rGH were undetectable at the lowest dilutions of serum tested. Serum rat insulin-like growth factor I (RIA), 3.5 U/ml in untreated intact prepubertal rats, increased to 4.7 and 5.0 U/ml, respectively, after 20 days of rGH treatment. In hypophysectomized rats, serum rat insulin-like growth factor I (RIA), undetectable in controls, was increased to 1.63 U/ml after 14 days treatment with 1 mg rGH/day. This study demonstrates that greater than normal growth can be stimulated in normal female rats by administration of large doses of homologous GH, but at the risk of serious adverse effects. Possible implications for the administration of GH to non-GH-deficient children, to promote taller stature, are clear.\r"

Amiodarone increased adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. Hepatic triglyceride lipase activity was decreased in both hypothyroid and amiodarone-treated groups. The effects of amiodarone on serum triglyceride and adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase were reversed by concomitant administration of T3. The activity of hepatic triglyceride lipase, however, was not increased. Our findings indicate that amiodarone causes marked changes in lipid metabolism which are similar to those found in hypothyroidism.\r"

  ".W": "We recently discovered a peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the E-domain of rat proinsulin-like growth factor II (pro-IGF-II) in medium conditioned by BRL-3A rat liver cells. This peptide begins at residue 117 in the pro-IGF-II sequence. To measure physiological concentrations of this peptide in serum, we established an RIA for a synthetic peptide [rat pro-IGF-II-(117-156); E-domain peptide] corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 40-amino acids of rat pro-IGF-II. The 41-residue peptide [Tyr116]pro-IGF-II-(117-156) was also synthesized and iodinated for use as tracer. Using polyclonal antibodies, we established a standard curve that measured as little as 25 pg/tube. Tracer was not displaced by insulin, human (h) IGF-I, hIGF-II, pro-hIGF-I-(71-105), rat GH, mouse EGF, ACTH, bovine PTH, ovine FSH, TRH, or LHRH under our assay conditions. However, a synthetic analog of the E-domain peptide [Phe117]pro-IGF-II-(118-156) showed displacement similar to that of the synthetic E-domain peptide. Serial dilutions of either culture medium or rat serum exhibited displacement parallel to the standard curve. Measurement of E-domain peptide in serum-free medium conditioned by BRL-3A rat liver cells showed a time-related increase in E-peptide concentration over a 72-h period. Analysis of E-peptide immunoreactivity from conditioned medium after gel filtration chromatography in 1 M acetic acid revealed a single peak which had a mol wt (determined by Western blot) identical to that of the synthetic E-peptide standard. The concentration of immunoreactive E-domain peptide levels in serum of 5-day-old rat pups was 30-40 times higher than concentrations in the serum of adult rats. Gel filtration chromatography of adult rat serum in 1 M acetic acid revealed a single major peak of immunoreactivity eluting at a position similar to the elution position of the E-domain peptide from BRL-3A rat liver cell-conditioned medium. The RIA described here should prove useful for measurement of the somatic output of E-domain peptide under different physiological conditions.\r"

In one series of experiments, the dorsal raphe (DRN), median raphe (MRN), and median raphe-pontine (MRN-RPn) regions were lesioned using a radiofrequency lesion maker set at 56 degrees C for 1 min. Lesions were induced, and atrial catheters were implanted on the day of estrogen injection. Six days later, blood samples were obtained every 2 h from 1100-2100 h to monitor the afternoon PRL surge. The animals were killed, and the hypothalami were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at -60 degrees C for determination of amine content using HPLC with electrochemical detection. The rest of the brain was fixed and sectioned to verify the location of brain lesions. Complete lesions of the DRN markedly attenuated the PRL surge (P less than 0.001) compared to the effect of sham or incomplete lesions. MRN lesions did not significantly alter the PRL surge; however, MRN lesions that included the RPn significantly (P less than 0.001) attenuated the afternoon PRL surge. Significant decreases in serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations were observed in the arcuate, ventromedial, suprachiasmatic, and medial preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, but not in the median eminence of the lesioned rats. DRN and MRN-RPn lesions decreased the 5-HT concentration in the ARC and MPN compared to sham lesion and DRN incomplete lesion values. Other hypothalamic areas did not show a similar effect of the lesions. The concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine, or dihydroxyphenylacetic acid were not altered by the lesions. In a second series of experiments one group of animals was injected ip with 10 mg/kg ketanserin, a serotonergic antagonist, at 1200 h on the sampling day. A second group was given 250 mg/kg p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) at 1700 h for 2 days before blood sampling was initiated on the third day. Both ketanserin and PCPA completely blocked the PRL surge. In the PCPA-injected animals, the 1100 and 1300 h PRL values were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than those in vehicle-injected controls. Animals injected with ketanserin at 1200 h had a 1300 h PRL value significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than was observed in vehicle-injected animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We tested the hypothesis that highly iodinated Tg synthesized by animals fed a high iodine diet is significantly more immunogenic than Tg containing fewer iodine atoms. Cornell strain (CS) chickens, genetically susceptible to iodide-induced thyroiditis, were fed either a high or a low iodine diet. They were killed, and their thyroidal Tg was analyzed for iodine; the high iodine Tg (HI-Tg) had at least 60 and the low iodine Tg (LI-Tg) had less than 13 atoms/molecule of Tg. To determine if the degree of Tg iodination affected its immunogenicity, these Tg preparations were administered iv to normal chickens without adjuvants. Their sera were tested for antibodies by direct binding radioassays and RIAs. HI-Tg stimulated the synthesis of antibodies that reacted well with HI-Tg and the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, but only weakly with LI-Tg. The birds immunized with LI-Tg produced very little antibody to LI-Tg, T3, or T4, but a modest amount to HI-Tg. In other experiments, Tg autoantibodies found in chickens maintained on a high iodine diet similarly demonstrated enhanced binding to HI-Tg. The present studies show that HI-Tg is more immunogenic than LI-Tg and supports the hypothesis that a high iodine diet induces Tg autoantibodies by increasing the immunogenicity of the Tg molecule. In marked contrast with iodide-induced Tg antibodies, the Tg antibodies accompanying the severe and early-onset thyroiditis of obese strain chickens are to a large degree independent of dietary iodine intake.\r"

One of the antisera (TG-B), which cross-reacted less than 3% with the related substances, neurotensin (NT), Lys8,Asn9-NT8-13, and xenopsin, was used to compare the distribution of immunoreactive NMN (iNMN) in the cat to that of immunoreactive NT (iNT). Although both iNMN and iNT were found primarily in the mucosa of the ileum, brain, pituitary, and adrenal, the ratio of the two activities varied, depending upon the tissue. Feline iNMN from brain, intestine, and adrenal was indistinguishable from synthetic NMN by HPLC. In contrast, extracts of stomach and pancreas contained primarily NMN-related cross-reacting substances, the concentrations of which increased up to 500-fold within minutes of extraction in aqueous acid. Since these peptides were also present to some extent in acid/acetone extracts, they appear to be endogenous variants of NMN stored in precursor forms which could be activated by acid-proteases. During sucrose gradient centrifugation of isotonic homogenates of feline brain, intestine, and adrenal, iNMN and iNT comigrated in association with synaptosome-like and vesicle-like particles, as identified by electron microscopy. These results demonstrate the presence of a peptide similar to porcine NMN in extracts of feline brain, adrenal, and small intestine and its association with signaling vesicles. In addition, the ability of gastric and pancreatic extracts to generate variants of NMN in large quantity is described.\r"

These data provide evidence for the following conclusions on the effect of DM on gastric secretion: ability to inhibit gastric secretion depends on the presence of the D-isomer of Ala at position 2, since [L-Ala2]DM is inactive; the shortest sequence with significant bioactivity is DM N-terminal tetrapeptide amide; the single replacement of amino acid residues in DM elicits a wide range of activities, varying from full biological activity of [Gly7]DM to those analogs with a complete lack of activity, such as [Pro4]DM and [Gly6]DM; and 4) coupling of protective groups to amino and hydroxyl groups of DM results in a significant loss of activity.\r"

The bound [125I]hGH was then internalized (within 10 min) and accumulated in the cell interior until a steady state was reached (by 60 min). At this time, where the rates of GH internalization, processing, and release are equivalent, 55% of total cell-associated [125I]hGH was intracellular. Internalization of [125I]hGH by acutely isolated (noncultured) adipocytes was preceded by a 20-min lag phase indicative of a temporary postbinding defect. The lag phase was not seen with cultured adipocytes. After preloading of [125I]hGH into the cell interior, cultured cells rapidly released [125I]hGH (t1/2 = 20-30 min) into the extracellular medium as both intact (25%) and degraded (75%) GH. The release of intact vs. degraded GH was distinguishable on the basis of kinetics and temperature dependence. In order to determine when internalized [125I]hGH entered a catabolic compartment, cultured adipocytes were incubated with [125I]hGH and the composition of intracellular GH was determined as a function of time. All [125I]hGH internalized during the first 20 min was intact. Between 20 and 30 min some of the internalized [125I]hGH entered a catabolic compartment and degradation products began accumulating within the adipocytes. Release of degraded [125I]hGH from cultured adipocytes began at 60 min. The processing of GH through the complete degradative pathway (binding, internalization, degradation, release) required a period of 1 h at 37 degrees C.\r"

Rats were bilaterally orchidectomized at varying postnatal days, i.e. 8 h after birth [neonatal castration (NC)] or at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks of age, and subjected to experiments at the age of about 10 weeks. Ten-week-old intact adults were also examined. All groups were injected ip with saline or sulpiride (1 mg/kg BW), and blood samples were collected by rapid decapitation 20 min later. Anterior pituitaries (AP) thus obtained were subjected to determination of PRL content. The circulating level of testosterone was similar among all castrated groups. Rats castrated on or after 3 weeks of age showed a significantly smaller PRL response to sulpiride than intact adults. In turn, sulpiride-induced PRL release in rats castrated on or before 2 weeks of age was similar to that in intact adults. However, the AP PRL content of saline control was uniformly lower in castrated males than in intact adults regardless of age at castration (P less than 0.01). The value in males castrated at 1 week was 2.0-fold higher than that in NC males, but a decreasing trend was observed in groups castrated at 2 or 3 weeks. That such a stimulation of AP PRL content by the neonatal testis is not mediated by an action of estradiol converted from testosterone has been suggested by the failure of daily neonatal tamoxifen (estrogen antagonist) treatment of intact males, before castration at 1 week, to decrease AP PRL content during adulthood. Sulpiride-induced reduction of the AP PRL content was significant only in males castrated at 6 weeks and intact adults. Characteristics of AP DA receptors labeled by [3H]spiperone were not different between males castrated at 6 weeks and intact adults. However, a heterogeneity was observed between NC males and a set of males castrated at 6 weeks and intact adults. The Kd was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater in NC males (mean +/- SE, 1.19 +/- 0.22 nM) than in males castrated at 6 weeks (0.52 +/- 0.08 nM), and the number of binding sites was significantly (P less than 0.05) larger in NC males (20.4 +/- 1.6 fmol/pituitary) than in both males castrated at 6 weeks and intact adults (12.6 +/- 2.0 and 13.1 +/- 1.9 fmol/pituitary, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Permanent effects of postnatal gonads on dopamine (DA)-mediated regulation of PRL secretion were examined in adult female rats of the Wistar-Imamichi strain. Experiments were uniformly done at the age of about 10 weeks. First, rats were bilaterally ovariectomized on varying postnatal days, i.e. 24 h after birth [neonatal castration (NC)] or at 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 weeks of age. Intact diestrous females were also examined. All groups were injected ip with saline or sulpiride (1 mg/kg BW), and blood samples were collected by rapid decapitation 20 min later. Also, in saline control groups, the anterior pituitary (AP) PRL content was determined. In NC females, significant PRL release was not observed by either sulpiride or saline. However, stimulation of PRL release by sulpiride was observed consistently in rats ovariectomized on or after 1 week of age. Although there was not a complete correlation between the plasma PRL level attained after sulpiride treatment and the AP PRL content, the general trend was that the AP PRL content was increased as the postnatal age of the ovariectomy was delayed. Values in intact adult females exceeded those in all of the castrated groups in both parameters. Second, daily sc injection for 7 days with estradiol benzoate (E2; 2.5 micrograms/kg BW) and/or progesterone (P; 5 mg/kg BW) was given after NC to determine which ovarian secretion(s) is involved in the aforementioned findings. Sulpiride stimulated PRL release in NC females that had been treated neonatally (postnatal days 3-9) with either E2 or P. This effect was accompanied by an increase in the AP PRL content. An enhancement of both parameters was also observed when the same dose of E2 or P was given in the fourth week (postnatal days 22-28). However, neither parameter was further augmented by concurrent administration of E2 and P at either postnatal time. Characteristics of AP DA receptors were subsequently analyzed in some of the foregoing groups using [3H]spiperone. The number of binding sites, when expressed as femtomoles per pituitary, did not differ among all groups examined. However, a significant difference in the dissociation constant (Kd) was observed between NC females and females castrated at 6 weeks of age. The Kd in NC females was not altered by subsequent neonatal treatment with E2 and/or P. Nonetheless, the E2 effect on Kd was dependent on when E2 was given after NC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Autoradiographic studies were carried out in slide-mounted rat pituitary sections using both [125I]2-[beta-(4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyl)ethyl-aminomethyl]tetralone ([125I]HEAT) and [3H]prazosin to localize alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Data analysis by densitometry showed that [125I]HEAT binding in the rat neural lobe was saturable and of high affinity, with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of about 5 pM. Data from competition studies using a variety of compounds demonstrated an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor profile for [125I]HEAT-binding sites in the rat pituitary. A high density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (1 microM prazosin-displaceable [125I]HEAT binding or 10 microM phentolamine-displaceable [3H]prazosin binding) was found present only in the neural lobe, with negligible concentrations in the anterior and intermediate lobes. The regulation of [125I]HEAT-binding sites in the neural lobe was examined in pituitary stalk-transected and superior cervical ganglionectomized rats. Significant increases in [125I]HEAT-binding sites were observed after superior cervical ganglionectomy, but no changes in [125I]HEAT binding were found in pituitary stalk-transected rats compared to that in sham-operated controls. These data provide the first identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the neural lobe of the rat pituitary and suggest that these receptors may be localized primarily in blood vessels. In addition, a primary role for the peripheral sympathetic nervous system in regulating the neurohypophyseal vasculature is suggested. The precise function of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the neural lobe in regulating posterior lobe hormone secretion remains to be demonstrated.\r"

Fatty acid (FA) release from liver slices was measured continuously by pH-stat titration. The pH-stat assay system was validated by simultaneous colorimetric measurement of FA and glycerol release. Liver slices incubated in a glucose-free, low buffering capacity medium and stimulated with NE (10(-6) M) exhibited a one proton (titrimetric) to one FA (colorimetric) release profile. Under similar conditions, NE administration also stimulated glycerol release, in the expected three FA (colorimetric) to one glycerol (colorimetric) ratio. NE stimulated FA release from liver slices in a dose-dependent manner; epinephrine did not have a lipolytic effect. The beta-agonist isoproterenol stimulated FA release, whereas alpha-agonists had no effect. Furthermore, the beta-antagonist propranolol inhibited both NE- and beta-agonist-stimulated FA release. Liver triacylglycerol lipase activity was also stimulated by NE. Propranolol inhibited NE-stimulated lipase activity. These results establish the presence of hormone-sensitive lipase in salmon liver and suggest that NE-stimulated lipid mobilization in salmon liver is mediated through beta-adrenergic pathways.\r"

We investigated the growth of cultured arterial smooth muscle cells under the influence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and examined the effect of these growth factors on the binding of [125I] IGF I and on the binding of [125I]PDGF to these cells. IGF I, FGF, and PDGF stimulated [6-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of confluent cultures of cells which were incubated in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. However, the effect of these growth factors on DNA synthesis was much more potent in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 1% fetal calf serum. FGF and PDGF potentiated the growth-promoting effect of IGF I. The binding of [125I]IGF I to the cells was increased after a preincubation with FGF and PDGF. The binding was potently increased by FGF (100 ng/ml) after a preincubation time of 30 min. There was an increase in binding during the first 3 h of preincubation followed by a decrease after 4-5 h. PDGF (10-1000 ng/ml) stimulated [125I]IGF I binding only after 2 h of preincubation. The stimulation was dose dependent. Maximal stimulation of the binding was observed after 3 h of preincubation followed by a decrease after 4-5 h of preincubation. Specific binding sites for PDGF on smooth muscle cells could be demonstrated too. A preincubation of confluent cells with IGF I caused a dose-dependent increase in [125I]PDGF binding. These results support the hypothesis that the regulation of the binding of a specific growth factor by a second growth factor is important for the control of cell growth.\r"

Animals received a 2.5-mg P or oil injection 24 h after administration of 30 micrograms estradiol benzoate. The animals were fitted with jugular catheters connected to a tether-swivel system. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals starting 3-4 h before and ending 12-20 h after P or oil injection. Plasma LH was measured by both bioassay and RIA. LH pulses were determined by the PULSAR program. P administration induced a BIA-LH surge with a latency of 71 +/- 10 min in all seven animals. The P-induced bioassayable LH (BIA-LH) surge consisted of an ascending phase (204 +/- 24 min), a plateau period (174 +/- 32 min), and a descending phase (376 +/- 60 min). Oil injection did not cause a LH surge (n = 4). BIA-LH release before P and that during the P-induced LH surge were pulsatile. Pulse intervals of BIA-LH before P treatment (57.1 +/- 5.2 min) were not different from those before (55.0 +/- 11.7 min) and after (62.9 +/- 16.3 min) oil injection. In contrast, pulse intervals during the ascending phase (35.0 +/- 4.0 min), plateau period (34.6 +/- 2.6 min), and descending phase (45.0 +/- 3.1 min) were significantly shorter (P less than 0.02) than those before P. Pulse amplitudes of BIA-LH during the ascending phase (125.3 +/- 28.7 ng/ml) and plateau period (253.9 +/- 27.0 ng/ml) were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than those (44.7 +/- 12.6 ng/ml) before P and during the descending phase (66.9 +/- 11.1 ng/ml). Radioimmunoassayable LH results were quite similar to those for BIA-LH, except that amplitude changes in radioimmunoassayable LH after P treatment were smaller than those in BIA-LH. It was concluded, therefore, that both the frequency and amplitude of pulsatile LH release increase during the P-induced LH surge, especially during the ascending phase and plateau period, in female rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, the present results support our previous conclusion that P facilitates pulsatile LHRH release with increases in frequency and amplitude in ovariectomized and estrogen-treated monkeys.\r"

  ".W": "The diurnal secretion of ACTH and corticosterone was examined in chronically cannulated young (3-4 months old), middle-aged (10-12 months old), and old (22-24 months old) Fischer 344 male rats. Plasma corticosterone in young rats increased from baseline concentrations of 78 +/- 5 to a maximum of 171 +/- 24 ng/ml at 1730 h and declined to basal levels by 1930 h. Middle-aged and old rats demonstrated a similar magnitude and time course of corticosterone release. However, comparison of the relative concentrations of ACTH released during the diurnal surge revealed that old rats secreted 35% less ACTH than young or middle-aged animals (P less than 0.05). Age-related changes in the sensitivity of the adrenal gland to a submaximal dose of ACTH were tested in dexamethasone-pretreated animals at 1100 and 1700 h in a separate experiment. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly greater after ACTH administration (1 mIU/kg ACTHAR, iv) at 1700 h in both young and old rats compared to 1100 h values (P less than 0.05), and levels 20 min post-ACTH injection at 1700 h were significantly greater in old than young or middle-aged rats at the same time (P less than 0.05). These results demonstrate that 1) there are no age-related changes in the diurnal secretion of corticosterone in Fischer 344 male rats; 2) there is a decline in the peak level of ACTH during the diurnal surge of old compared to young animals; and 3) adrenal sensitivity to ACTH at 1700 h is greater in old compared to young or middle-aged rats. We hypothesize that the greater increase in adrenal sensitivity to ACTH is responsible for the maintenance of the corticosterone rhythm in the presence of diminished ACTH concentrations in older rats.\r"

We developed a human marrow culture system in which multinucleated cells with several characteristics of osteoclasts form. Multinucleated cells began to form during the first week of culture, with maximum numbers formed after 3 weeks. PTH (25-50 ng/ml) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (10(-10)-10(-8) M) increased formation of these cells, and these effects were inhibited by calcitonin. These multinucleated cells contained nonspecific esterase and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, a marker enzyme of osteoclasts, and had several ultrastructural features of osteoclasts. We used this marrow cell culture technique to study a patient with hyperparathyroidism and markedly increased osteoclasts on bone marrow biopsy. The marrow from this patient formed increased numbers of multinucleated cells in vitro. After parathyroidectomy both multinucleated cell formation in vitro and osteoclast numbers on bone biopsy decreased significantly. This long term marrow culture system represents the first demonstration of human osteoclast-like cell formation in vitro. This system should permit studies to evaluate factors controlling formation of cells with certain osteoclast characteristics in vitro and their precursors as well as to evaluate abnormalities in osteoclast formation in patients with metabolic bone disease.\r"

Three sublines, T4-OR26, T4-0I96, and T4-0I320, were established from sporadic outgrowths in virgins of TPDMT-4 pieces passaged long in breeding and estradiol (E2)- plus progesterone-treated mice and of enzymatically dissociated TPDMT-4 cells, respectively. T4-OR26 tumors produced ovarian-responsive growth and maintained the parent levels of ER and E2-dependent PR. T4-OI320 and T4-OI96 tumors were ovarian independent or autonomous. The former had ER, but not E2-dependent PR, and the latter had neither. To clarify the mechanism of acquisition of autonomy by hormone-dependent neoplastic cells, comparative ER studies were conducted between TPDMT-4 and T4-OI320 tumors. Although cytosolic, microsomal, and nuclear translocated ER levels were generally lower in T4-OI320 tumors, the dissociation constants, determined by the dextran-charcoal technique, steroid specificity, sedimentation data in sucrose gradients, and activation studies using DNA binding, molecular transformation from 4S to 5S, and [3H]E2 dissociation from [3H] E2-ER complexes as markers, revealed no autonomy-specific changes in cytosolic ER. Small but significant differences in the affinity of [3H]E2 to nuclear ER and the [3H]E2 dissociation rate from nuclear bound [3H]E2-ER complexes were found between both tumors. Hormone-dependent tumors may progress toward autonomy with different receptor statuses in different environments, and lack of E2-dependent PR synthesis in ER-positive tumors may be due to defects at postreceptor or nuclear levels involving subtle changes in interaction between activated ER and nuclei.\r"

Disuccinimidyl suberate, a cross-linking agent, was used to demonstrate specific binding of [125I]iodo-Tyr0CRF to plasma membranes from these cells. After cross-linking [125I] iodo-Tyr0CRF, the membrane proteins were solubilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. A single radioactively labeled band, corresponding to a mol wt of 66,000, was identified by autoradiography. [125I]Iodo-Tyr0CRF binding to these membranes was inhibited by 10(-7) M unlabeled CRF or an equimolar concentration of the CRF analog sauvagine. Similar concentrations (10(-7) M) of TRH, GnRH, insulin, [Arg8]vasopressin, somatostatin, and ACTH did not inhibit [125I]iodo-Tyr0CRF binding to the plasma membranes. Incubation of AtT-20 cells for 24 h in the presence of 10 nM dexamethasone reduced [125I]iodo-Tyr0CRF binding by 80% compared to that in untreated cells. Dexamethasone also inhibited the CRF-stimulated beta-endorphin-like immunoactivity secretory response. These data indicate that binding of CRF to a specific membrane protein is an integral component in the stimulation of AtT-20 cells by CRF.\r"

Immunoblotting was performed on both homogenate and microsomal preparations, using a rabbit antirat liver reductase antibody and 125I-labeled protein A. A dose-dependent increase in HMG-CoA reductase protein content and activity was produced by ACTH. A time-course study revealed a latency of 60 min, followed by a significant increase at 120 and 180 min, in this response. At 180 min, microsomal reductase activity was significantly increased 4.7-fold, whereas the reductase protein content of microsomes and homogenate preparations was enhanced 4.4- and 3.1-fold, respectively. We calculated that only 40-50% of the reductase protein content was microsomal, indicating that more than one pool of the enzyme is present in adrenals. The coadministration of cycloheximide with ACTH not only prevented the hormonal effect on the protein content and activity of the reductase, but also produced, 180 min posttreatment, 58-69% and 65-86% decreases in reductase protein and activity, respectively. Also, both reductase activity and protein content fluctuated in parallel during the day. In the presence of proteolytic enzyme inhibitors and iodoacetamide, a major band in the area of 102K mol wt was evidenced by immunoblotting. These results indicate that ACTH and other conditions that provoke a change in adrenal HMG-CoA reductase activity also induce, in parallel, a change in the reductase protein content. The basic unit of the reductase has an apparent mol wt of about 102K.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have disclosed a novel intraovarian paracrine system whereby catecholestrogens [e.g. 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OH-E2)], synthesized locally from estradiol (E2) can stimulate progesterone secretion by granulosa cells (GC). Since these studies suggested that effects of 2-OH-E2 were discrete from those of E2, the present studies were undertaken to determine if the effects of 2-OH-E2 could be mediated through or interact with the catecholamine response system of GC. First, the effects of 2-OH-E2 were compared with those of E2 and epinephrine (EPI) using undifferentiated porcine GC. After 4 days of treatment, saturating concentrations of EPI (1 microgram/ml), 2-OH-E2 (4 micrograms/ml), and E2 (1 microgram/ml) stimulated progesterone production per cell 2-, 9-, and 10-fold, respectively. Saturating doses of EPI plus 2-OH-E2 or EPI plus E2 caused further significant increases in progesterone production above the effects of any single treatment, and the effects of EPI plus 2-OH-E2 were significantly greater than that of EPI plus E2. Isoproterenol mimicked the effect of EPI. Neither propranolol (a beta-antagonist) nor phentolamine (an alpha-antagonist) blocked the effects of 2-OH-E2, suggesting that effects of 2-OH-E2 were not mediated through alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors. Collectively, these data suggest that 2-OH-E2, beta-adrenergic agonists, and E2 use separate response systems. To further evaluate the interaction between catecholamines and 2-OH-E2, GC were treated with increasing doses of 2-OH-E2 with or without EPI or isoproterenol. EPI and isoproterenol caused a synergistic increase in progesterone production above that induced by all doses of 2-OH-E2 along (average 3.8 +/- 0.7- and 3.2 +/- 0.4-fold enhancement for EPI and isoproterenol, respectively). This synergistic effect was blocked with addition of propranolol, indicating a beta-adrenergic mediation for the catecholamine portion of this effect. Studies using the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, U-0521, and the O-methyl derivative of EPI, metanephrine, suggested that catechol-O-methyltransferase present in GC dramatically reduces the potency of EPI, but is not involved in the synergism between EPI and 2-OH-E2. In conclusion, 2-OH-E2 is a more efficacious stimulator of progesterone secretion than catecholamines and synergizes with beta-adrenergic agonists to further stimulate progesterone production by GC. The mechanism by which catecholamines and 2-OH-E2 interact within GC is unknown.4+owever, this catecholamine/2-OH-E2 interaction\r"

  ".W": "The central nervous system depends on thyroid hormones (TH) in regard to its development, maturation, and maintenance of normal functions. As there is much evidence to suggest that the effects of TH are mainly mediated through specific nuclear binding sites, we have studied the anatomical distribution of T3 nuclear receptors in different regions of adult rat brain, and the localization of receptors in the fractionated neuronal and glial nuclei of neocortex, paleocortex, and cerebellum. Purified nuclei from the various brain regions were prepared by ultracentrifugation in 2.2 M sucrose. Purified neuronal and glial fractions were obtained by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation in 2.2 and 2.4 M sucrose. The washed nuclear fractions were used for T3 binding assay at 37 C for 30 min and the data analyzed by least squares nonlinear regression analysis. Nonfractionated nuclei from all regions studied were found to have similar dissociation constant (Kd) values (1.04-1.38 nM) and Eadie-Hofstee plots indicated the presence of an apparently ubiquitous single class of high affinity, low capacity binding sites. The increase in binding from cerebellum (54 +/- 24 fmol/mg DNA; mean +/- SE) to neocortex (666 +/- 89 fmol/mg DNA) showed a caudo-cranial pattern. In fractionated neuronal nuclei, the same trend was observed, only to a greater degree (1628 +/- 266, 994 +/- 76 and 212 +/- 29 fmol/mg DNA in neocortex, paleocortex, and cerebellum, respectively); the difference between corresponding values for glial nuclei of neocortex and paleocortex (357 +/- 139 and 250 +/- 92 fmol/mg DNA, respectively) was not statistically significant, and no specific T3 binding was found in cerebellar glial nuclei. These data suggest that TH may have an important role in neurons from phylogenetically newer regions, concerned with higher mental functions. The caudo-rostral distribution pattern may also indicate a gradient of TH actions in central nervous system regions.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were designed to localize within the hypothalamus and neighboring areas the serotonergic terminals which are implicated in suckling-induced PRL release. The initial experiments were performed to characterize the circulating hormone profile induced by suckling in lactating rats, previously separated from their pups. Five minutes of suckling induced an increase in serum PRL only. During these 5 min, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid concentrations were determined in the pars nervosa of the pituitary gland, hypothalamic nuclei, dorsal, and median raphe nuclei. An increase by 80% (P less than 0.01) in 5-HT concentration was found only in the rostral part of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (rNHA). In order to investigate causal effect between the altered 5-HT neuronal activity in the rNHA and the suckling-induced PRL release, serotonergic neurotoxin was bilaterally injected in the rNHA on day 1 of lactation. Litters were adjusted to eight pups each and weighed daily to determine litter growth rates. On day 8 of lactation, litters were separated from their mothers for 4 h and allowed to suckle for 5 or 15 min after which the mothers were decapitated. Litters from lesioned animals grew at a lower rate (P less than 0.0001) than control and sham-operated animals. Serum PRL increased with suckling in animals bearing the correct rNHA lesions, but the values were lower than in control and sham-operated animals after 5 (P less than 0.05) and 15 (P less than 0.01) min. Therefore we postulate that the rNHA is the site of termination of a stimulatory serotonergic pathway on PRL release induced by suckling.\r"

  ".U": "87190146\r", 
  ".W": "The ovariectomized immature rat was used as a model for analysis of action of progesterone as a modulator of receptor-mediated functional responsiveness in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus. In response to estrogen exposure, cytosolic progesterone receptors appear rapidly, rise in concentration to a peak at 12 h, then fall to a plateau level well above control, which is maintained for at least an additional 20 h. Progesterone administration at the peak 12-h interval induces maximal nuclear accumulation of its own receptor within 1-2 h, with apparent extensive processing occurring thereafter. To this point, no differences were seen between anterior pituitary and hypothalamic responses. If animals were administered progesterone (0.8 mg/kg BW) at the 12-h peak interval, subsequent nuclear accumulation of anterior pituitary estrogen receptor by an injection of estradiol was suppressed if, and only if, the interval between progesterone and estradiol injection did not exceed 2 h; at no time interval did progesterone have an effect in the hypothalamus. In both tissues, estradiol readministration at 12 h after an initial injection stimulates a second wave of progesterone receptor activity, again peaking 12 h later. A single injection of progesterone 1 h before the second estradiol administration blocks the second peak of progesterone receptor in the anterior pituitary, but not in the hypothalamus. If the interval between the progesterone and second estradiol injections is extended to 4 h, the second progesterone receptor peak appears as though no progesterone had been introduced. The results indicate a critical temporal reliance of the inhibitory effects of progesterone on estrogen receptor activity and estrogen function in a well defined animal model. The effect is progesterone receptor-mediated and is manifested in the anterior pituitary, but not in the hypothalamus, even though the kinetics of estrogen-induced progesterone receptor activity are indistinguishable between the two tissues.\r"

In one set of experiments T4 plasma level (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) was systematically followed up in individual GVHR and control mice. Compared to the control, GVHR triggered off a significant and sustained decrease of T4 plasma level. In another set of experiments, TSH plasma levels (RIA) were measured in killed animals. GVHR induced an early elevation of plasma TSH. In a third set of experiments, mice undergoing GVHR received daily injections of L-T4 (0.03, 0.15, or 0.3 microgram/mouse). Compared to the control (saline injected) GVHR mice, T4 supply did not improve GVHR state. No positive effect of the high dose and rather a negative effect of both lower doses especially on glucose plasma concentration, were observed. All these data suggest that thyroid gland is primarily and very early involved in the onset of the GVH disease.\r"

In our HPLC program for indoles the cyclic 2-hydroxymelatonin eluted at 25 min, separately from synthetic indoles, between 6-hydroxymelatonin (19 min) and melatonin (35 min). In [3H] melatonin studies it was found to be present (at 25 min in our HPLC), accounting for 5% of the urinary metabolites of melatonin in the rat. Since beta-glucuronidase-arylsulfatase treatment of rat urine did not liberate the cyclic 2-hydroxymelatonin this would appear to be excreted into urine as the free form.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of the gene coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPck) is under complex multi-hormonal control. A stimulatory effect of T3 on the expression of this gene has been described, but it has not been related to nuclear T3 receptor occupancy. We therefore studied simultaneously nuclear T3 receptor occupancy, PEPck enzyme activities, and PEPck messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the liver of thyroidectomized, T3-treated rats. A dose-dependent increase in receptor occupancy and in enzyme activities was observed 24 h after a single ip injection of T3. However, no increase in the levels of PEPck mRNA was observed, using a specific complementary DNA (pPCK10). To evaluate this further, time-course experiments were performed over a 24 h period after a single ip injection of a receptor saturating dose of T3. These experiments showed simultaneous increases of PEPck enzyme activities and PEPck mRNA levels. Receptor occupancy had increased to 95% 3 h after injection of T3, whereas maximal levels of enzyme activity and mRNA were obtained 6-12 h after T3 administration. Translational efficiency did not change during induction. Twenty-four hours after T3 administration, mRNA levels and enzyme activity had declined, but receptor occupancy was still maximal. We conclude that T3 influences PEPck gene expression primarily at a pretranslational (transcriptional) level. The transient increase in PEPck mRNA despite persisting full receptor occupancy suggests a modification in time of the interaction between the T3-receptor complex and the regulatory region of the PEPck gene.\r"

Upon addition to nuclear membranes, hCG stimulated this enzyme, but not Mg2+-ATPase or NADH cytochrome c reductase, in a dose-, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. Heat-denatured hCG, however, had no effect on NTPase activity. hCG antisera blocked hCG's ability to stimulate the NTPase activity. While human LH also stimulated luteal nuclear membrane NTPase activity, a variety of other hormones tested, including alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG and 1 and 10 mM cAMP, had no effect on the enzyme. hCG's effect on NTPase is tissue specific in that it had no effect on liver or kidney nuclear membrane NTPase activity. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that hCG acts directly on the luteal cell nucleus, thus raising the possibility that internalized hCG might influence nuclear functions before it is eventually degraded in lysosomes of luteal cells.\r"

These developmental patterns correlate well with the immunohistochemical appearance of prepropressophysin translation products previously reported in these nuclei. A prominent day-night rhythm of vasopressin mRNA levels was evident in the SCN on day 21 of gestation; the rhythm was also present on postnatal days 2 and 11. No such rhythm was present in the supraoptic nuclei at any developmental stage examined. These results demonstrate regulated expression of the vasopressin gene during fetal life. Vasopressin mRNA levels in the SCN are already under specific circadian control when the nuclei are morphologically immature and lacking many of the connections found in adult animals.\r"

Sucrose density gradient analysis of high salt extract of cultured explants showed the presence of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3 specific binding activity sedimenting at 3.3 S. Specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity in mammary explants varied as a function of the hormonal milieu in culture. The highest activity was found in explants cultured in the presence of insulin, cortisol, and PRL, whereas only a marginal activity was present in explants cultured with insulin. The comparison of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity in explants cultured with insulin and with the three hormone combination by Scatchard plot analysis indicated that the synergistic actions of insulin, cortisol, and PRL increased the number of 1,25-(OH)2D3 specific binding proteins as much as 6-fold; however, the affinity constant of the binding protein was relatively constant in the two systems. Time course studies showed that the increase in 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity was detectable as early as 12 h after the addition of cortisol and PRL to insulin-primed explants. The increase was inhibited by the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting that the hormonal stimulation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity involves both transcriptional and translational process. These results indicate that insulin, cortisol, and PRL stimulate the specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 binding activity during the induction of mammary functional differentiation when milk protein synthesis takes place.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of isolated adrenocortical cells to secrete corticosterone in response to ACTH challenge declines as rats age, but the site or mechanism(s) of this impairment is still unknown. To test the functionality of steroidogenic capacity per se, we measured the key enzyme activities involved in corticosterone biosynthesis. We also measured the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content and nonsteroidogenic enzymes specific for subcellular fractions. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were isolated from the adrenals of 2-, 12-, and 18-month-old animals and used for various enzyme measurements. Mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme activity (nanomoles per min mg protein-1) increased from a mean of 0.43 +/- 0.06 in 2-month-old rats to 1.26 +/- 0.11 and 1.51 +/- 0.06 in 12- and 18-month old rats, respectively. After incubation with 5-cholesten-3 beta,25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol; 25 micrograms/ml) side-chain cleave activity rose to 5.0 +/- 0.6, 12.4 +/- 1.2, and 16 +/- 1.4 nmol min-1 mg protein-1 in adrenal mitochondrial fractions from 2-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats, respectively. In contrast, mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content did not vary with advancing age. Microsomal delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-delta 5-delta 4-isomerase activities were similar in 2- and 12-month-old rats, but 21-hydroxylase (nanomoles per min mg protein-1) activity was significantly increased in 12-month-old rats (2-month-old, 5.2 +/- 0.2; 12-month-old, 7.7 +/- 0.5). Finally, mitochondrial 11 beta-hydroxylase was comparable in both age groups. In addition, activities of mitochondrial nonsteroidogenic enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase, amytal insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not change with age. It appears from the evidence presented that the activities of the steroidogenic enzymes are not responsible for the diminished capacity in corticosterone production seen with aging in the rat.\r"

The interconversion of F-E at mid-gestation (day 100; term = day 184) was compared with that in animals near term (day 170) in which the fetus, but not the placenta, was removed (fetectomy) on day 100 and that in baboons treated daily between days 140 and 170 of gestation with the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol [1-(p-diethylamino-ethoxyphenol)1-phenyl-2-p-methoxyphenolethan ol (MER-25)]. In fetectomized animals at term, transuteroplacental conversion of E to F (30%) exceeded (P less than 0.05) that of the reverse reaction (7%). This pattern of metabolism was significantly different from that measured in intact pregnant animals at term, in which oxidation of F to E (28%) exceeded reduction of E to F (4%). In contrast, placental metabolism in fetectomized baboons at term was similar to that in pregnant animals at mid-gestation, in which conversion of F to E (20%) was lower (P less than 0.05) than reduction of E to F (39%). Treatment of intact pregnant baboons with MER-25 also resulted in a pattern of F-E metabolism across the placenta at term which was similar to that measured at midgestation but different from that in untreated baboons at term. Collectively, our findings show that the striking alteration in F-E interconversion from reduction (E to F) at midgestation to oxidation (F to E) by term, as measured across the placenta in vivo during the second half of baboon pregnancy, does not occur in animals lacking a fetus or in intact baboons in which the action of estrogen was inhibited. Therefore, we suggest that the fetus and/or the hormones of pregnancy that are dependent upon the fetus (i.e. estrogen) regulate transuteroplacental corticosteroid metabolism.\r"

The degree of rounding of cells was measured by determining mean cell height and longest cell diameter. Three measurements of steroid production were made: production of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and production of pregnenolone by isolated mitochondria. Cells grown on poly(HEMA) showed increase in mean cell height, decrease in longest diameter (i.e. rounding), and increase in all three measurements of steroidogenesis. In the case of synthesis of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone, the response was dependent on the concentration of poly(HEMA), being greater with higher concentrations (up to 10(-4) M), of this agent. Moreover the degree of rounding (cell height) was correlated with production of 20 alpha-dihydroprogesterone at three concentrations of poly(HEMA) (r = 0.93. ACTH at a supramaximal concentration produced increases in all of these responses to the poly(HEMA) surface. Polylysine produced flatter cells (lower mean height and greater longest diameter) than plastic and also inhibited all three steroidogenic responses to ACTH. (Bu)2cAMP exerted the same effects as ACTH. Growing cells on poly(HEMA) or polylysine did not affect production of cyclic AMP by the cells. Addition of poly(HEMA) or polylysine to the medium in which the cells were incubated, at the same concentrations as those used for influencing cell shape, was without effect on steroid synthesis or the response to ACTH. Cells grown on poly(HEMA) show decreased incorporation of [3H] thymidine into DNA. It is concluded that cell shape influences the delivery of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membrane and in this way, increases the production of steroids by Y-1 cells and that the effects of poly(HEMA) on cell shape, cholesterol transport, and synthesis of DNA may involve microfilaments.\r"

After label injection into the third ventricle, rats were killed 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h later. The hypothalamic peptides were quantitated by specific RIA and separated by HPLC to allow quantitation of label incorporation into each peptide. In intact rats, labeling of both OXT and AVP rose rapidly to peak at 2 h; thereafter, radioactivity in both peptides declined slowly to 8 h. In hypophysectomized rats, labeling of AVP fell below that in intact animals at all time points. Labeling of OXT was somewhat below normal 2 h after label injection, but considerably above normal at 4 and 8 h. For comparison, label incorporation into somatostatin-14 (SRIF-14) and somatostatin-28 (SRIF-28) was also studied in the same animals. In intact rats, labeling of both SRIF peptides rose slowly to maximal values at 8 h. In hypophysectomized animals, labeling of each peptide was reduced substantially at all times tested. Endogenous cysteine specific activity and protein specific activity did not differ between intact and hypophysectomized animals. Immunoreactive levels of AVP and OXT in the hypothalamus were unaffected by hypophysectomy, though total SRIF-like immunoreactivity was depressed. Together these results suggest that hypothalamic neurons synthesize OXT and AVP at rates much faster than those for the SRIF peptides, and that hypophysectomy has differential effects on the syntheses of cysteine-containing peptides in the hypothalamus. Specifically, the syntheses of SRIF-14 and SRIF-28 appear to be sizeably reduced in hypophysectomized rats, while that of AVP only modestly diminished. OXT synthesis may be increased.\r"

  ".W": "Primary cultures of sheep thyroid cells have been used to study the inhibitory effects of iodide on thyroid function. Under the influence of TSH, iodide was concentrated with a cell to medium ratio of 20. When thyroid hormone secretion was measured from cells cultured without addition of exogenous iodide, preferential T3 secretion was evident. The optimum iodide concentration for T4 and T3 synthesis and secretion was 10(-6) M. Prior exposure to 10(-5) M or more iodide decreased subsequent iodide transport in a concentration-dependent manner compared to that in cells acutely exposed to iodide. Although cell to medium ratios were decreased, intracellular iodide concentrations continued to rise with increasing external iodide concentrations, and iodide available for thyroid hormone synthesis was not in limited supply. Iodide concentrations of 10(-4) M or greater inhibited iodothyronine synthesis and thyroid hormone secretion, assessed by both assay of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble Na125I activity in cells and RIA of T4 and T3 in the medium and cell layer. An intermediate concentration of 10(-5) M iodide had a marked inhibitory effect on T4 and T3 secretion, but iodothyronine formation on thyroglobulin was only slightly affected. Our results suggest a preferential inhibitory effect of elevated iodide concentrations on thyroid hormone secretion. The adaptive advantages of this selective inhibition would allow storage of iodothyronines in times of iodide sufficiency while maintaining euthyroidism.\r"

The effect of TSH on the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue, was prompt, being 200% over basal value after 10 min and maximal after 12 h (600-700% increase). The TSH effect was dose dependent, with half-maximum stimulation at 10 microU TSH/ml, and maximum stimulation at 1 mU TSH/ml. TSH enhanced also the uptake of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose by FRTL-5 cells. The TSH activation of glucose transport had the following characteristics: it was mimicked by (Bu)2-cAMP (1 mM) and by agents that increase cAMP levels in thyroid cells, such as forskolin (10 microM) and cholera toxin (50 micrograms/ml); it involved the facilitated glucose transport system in that it was inhibited in a dose-related manner by both cytochalasin B and phloretin; it showed a glucose stereochemical sensitivity, being affected by D-glucose and 3-O-methyl-glucose, and not by L-glucose; it was characterized by an increase in the maximum velocity (Vmax) of glucose uptake (from 15.3 to 66.0 fmol/min X micrograms DNA) without change in the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) (5.3 mM); the effect on the Vmax was due to an increase in the number of surface glucose transporters as indicated by the enhancement of the D-glucose-sensitive fraction of [3H]cytochalasin B binding sites that in thyroid plasma membranes of cells exposed to TSH for 2 and 8 h, increased from 5.0 (basal value) to 10.4 and 23.1 pmol/mg protein, respectively. These data indicate that in FRTL-5 cells TSH stimulates the glucose transport system by an enhancement of the number of functional glucose transporters in the thyroid plasma membrane.\r"

  ".U": "87190166\r", 
  ".W": "Mediocre precision has been a frustrating feature of the hypophysectomized female rat body weight gain bioassay for GH, especially human GH (hGH), in the original procedural format of injections once daily, ip, for 10-14 days. Consequently, the principal conditions that influence the bioassay's precision were identified and appropriately modified, by detailed systematic analysis of the daily body weight gain response to treatment with bovine GH (bGH) and hGH. Under identical conditions, the slope and precision of dose-response curves for hGH were markedly inferior to those for bGH. This prompted revision of the injection frequency for hGH to four times daily, sc. Dramatic improvement in slope and precision for hGH resulted, nearly equal to the excellent slope and precision attained for bGH with twice daily injections, sc. In addition, direct and indirect assessment of GH antibody formation pinpointed day 8 as the time of onset of growth-neutralizing antibodies, which are deleterious to precision and accuracy. Accordingly, the injection period was limited to 7 days. A warm environment of 31-32 C to sustain optimal animal health and responsiveness and objective specifications for selection of animals were also used. These modifications, incorporated into standardized procedures (four times daily injections, sc, 7 consecutive days, for hGH; twice daily injections, sc, 7 consecutive days, for bGH) produced a lambda, the index of precision, which hovered on the highly respectable bioassay value of 0.2 consistently and reliably. The demonstration of differing performance characteristics and differing immunogenicities of bGH and hGH in the rat invalidates the use of one as the reference standard for the bioassay of the other, and beclouds the quantitative meaning of all prior data derived in that way.\r"

T3 and T4 induce the cells to change from a flattened fibroblastic morphology to a rounded or spindle-shaped morphology. The induction in morphological changes is T3 and T4 specific and dose dependent. Thyronine and rT3 are ineffective in inducing morphological changes; the half-maximal effective concentrations for T3 and T4 are 0.3 and 2 nM, respectively. Concomitantly, T3 stimulates cell growth, as indicated by a 2-fold reduction in doubling time and a 2-fold increase in mitotic rate. The growth-stimulating effect has the same analog specificity and dose dependency as the morphological changes. The morphological changes could be potentially useful for evaluating the biological effects of T3 and its analogs and in studying the mechanism of thyroid hormone action.\r"

  ".U": "87190168\r", 
  ".W": "Estrogens and androgens are well known to exert opposing effects in several tissues. In this study, we explored the possibility that there might be a direct antiandrogenic effect of estradiol on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Since the biological activity of androgens is mediated by specific androgen receptors, and because the abundance of androgen receptors in target tissues is thought to be rate limiting for androgen action, we examined whether estradiol regulates the quantity of androgen receptors in MCF-7 cells. Cells treated with 2.6 nM estradiol exhibited markedly lower levels of cytoplasmic androgen receptors, measured by [3H]5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone ([3H]DHT) binding, compared to levels in cells receiving ethanol vehicle alone. The effect was time dependent, and 6-day treatment of cells with estradiol resulted in an 80% reduction in [3H]DHT binding. Occupancy of androgen receptors by estradiol did not account for this difference. Cytosol competition studies demonstrated that the androgen receptor in MCF-7 cells possesses an approximately 125-fold lower affinity for estradiol than for DHT. In addition, tamoxifen, a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist, blocked the estradiol effects on [3H]DHT binding. These latter studies support the hypothesis that this estradiol action is mediated by the estrogen receptor. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that the observed decrease in [3H]DHT binding after estradiol treatment was due to an absolute decrease in the number of cytoplasmic androgen receptors per cell. The estradiol-mediated reduction in androgen receptor content was dose dependent; a 50% reduction in androgen receptor number was observed after 6 days of treatment with 2.6 X 10(-11) M estradiol. Additional experiments revealed that MCF-7 cells exhibited a time-dependent increase in androgen receptor content when estradiol was withdrawn; continued estradiol treatment prevented this rise in receptor content. Moreover, androgen receptor levels began to decrease from the point when the ethanol vehicle added to the medium was replaced with 2.6 nM estradiol. In summary, estradiol treatment caused a reduction in androgen receptors, and estradiol withdrawal lead to a rise in androgen receptors. We believe that these results provide a mechanism whereby estradiol may directly antagonize androgen action. Conversely, estradiol withdrawal may potentiate androgen action by allowing androgen receptor levels to rise. This hypothesis may help explain the basis of the estrogen/androgen ratio as a predictor of sex steroid response.\r"

  ".U": "87190169\r", 
  ".W": "In the chick embryo liver, generation of T3 from T4 by 5'-deiodinating (5'D) systems is reported to be minimal until just before hatching, which occurs on day 21 of incubation. Studies were, therefore, performed to determine whether this is due to the absence of a 5'D system until late in development or to the presence of an active 5-deiodinating (5D) system capable of converting T4 to rT3 and T3 to 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Studies were performed in microsomes of liver from 15 to 21-day-old chick embryos. T3 was formed from T4 in microsomes from embryos at all stages studied provided that the substrate concentration was at least 5 X 10(-8) M. However, T4 could not be employed for studying changes in 5'D activity because the T3 formed underwent further degradation, and the T4 was also metabolized by 5D systems. rT3 was used instead, since its metabolism was less complex than that of T4, and Eadie-Hofstee plots of kinetic data were linear. Development was associated with a more than 2-fold increase in the maximum velocity of 5'D activity; there was no change in Km. 5D activity, which was studied using T3 as substrate, also exhibited linear reaction kinetics. 5D activity was highest on day 15 and decreased by more than 90% during the last 2 days of development due entirely to a decrease in the maximum velocity. Other characteristics of the two enzymes (substrate preference and inhibitor effects) indicate that they are comparable to the type I and III deiodinases found in mammalian systems. It is concluded that the failure to observe T3 generation from T4 in the developing chick until close to hatching, when substrate concentrations are below 5 X 10(-8) M, is due primarily to the presence of an active deiodinase which rapidly converts T4 and T3 to inactive analogs. It is suggested that the amount of T3 required by the developing embryo is extremely critical and the two enzyme systems act in a coordinated way to protect hepatic T3-sensitive mechanisms from overexposure to T3.\r"

To clarify the influence of these variables on hCG doubling time, we obtained serial blood specimens every 2 to 4 days between postovulatory day 12 and 70 from 16 women who conceived while monitoring basal body temperature. The serum concentration of beta-hCG was determined by radioimmunoassay. Serial doubling time of hCG was calculated in all subjects and correlated with GA and hCG concentration. Least-squares estimates of 95% confidence bands were established from regression analysis given the second hCG concentration for each pair of samples or GA. For elimination of the need for calculation and thus improvement of the clinical utility of doubling time determinations, a nomogram relating the concentrations of hCG in paired serum samples to doubling time was constructed. We observed a significant correlation of doubling time with hCG concentration and GA, both in the group overall and within each individual pregnancy. These data support the recommendation that doubling time determinations should be evaluated with reference to normal values for a given GA or hCG concentration and suggest that previously proposed normal values of doubling time in early normal pregnancy may be low.\r"

At 24 hours, samples held at -5.0 degrees C for 10 minutes and seeded, but not samples held at -5.0 degrees C and not seeded, had higher motility than samples held at +5.0 degrees C. In experiment 2, semen samples were frozen, and fertilizability was evaluated in a zona-free hamster egg penetration assay. Seeded samples had a higher frequency of sperm penetration than either nonfrozen or nonseeded samples. In experiment 3, nonfrozen controls and frozen treatment groups were evaluated for the frequency of survival and acrosomal integrity. Seeded samples had higher frequencies of survival and loss of acrosomal integrity than nonseeded samples. All frozen-thawed samples had a lower frequency of survival and a higher frequency of loss of acrosomal integrity than nonfrozen controls. Although altered patterns of fertilizability and acrosomal integrity are induced, collectively these data suggest that incorporating a holding temperature of -5.0 degrees C for 10 minutes and seeding may result in a superior protocol for freezing human spermatozoa.\r"

Fifty-microgram estrogen-containing OCs doubled basal PRL levels at 5 to 8 weeks in those whose initial control values fell below 15 ng/ml, but the PRL elevation was no longer evident at 6 months of drug use. These OCs induced a small but significant lowering of PRL at 5 to 8 weeks in those with control levels of 15 ng/ml or higher.

During this interval, 16 couples underwent the combined IVF-GIFT procedure. All of the IVF-GIFT couples had at least two oocytes inseminated in vitro and at least two oocytes for GIFT. Of the 16 IVF-GIFT couples, only 1 (6.25%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. More important, 50% (8/16) of the IVF-GIFT couples had no oocytes fertilized in vitro. With the information concerning lack of fertilization in vitro, appropriate recommendations concerning future fertility management can be made. If the same couples had undergone the GIFT procedure alone, without additional oocytes fertilized in vitro, this information would not have been obtained.\r"

Fertilization in vitro was assessed 16 to 20 hours later. An overall pregnancy rate after GIFT of 40.0% (12/30) in normospermic couples and 16.7% (2/12) in oligospermic couples was seen. Supernumerary oocytes were submitted to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and the findings related to the likelihood of pregnancy. No correlation between IVF and the likelihood of GIFT pregnancies was found in either the oligospermic or normospermic couples. A similar proportion of pregnancies was seen in couples with or without evidence of fertilization of the supernumerary oocytes in both the oligospermic and normospermic couples. However, a high proportion of normospermic couples with no evidence of fertilization had only one oocyte remaining for insemination. These results suggest that the failure of low numbers of supernumerary oocytes to fertilize in vitro after GIFT relates to oocyte selection criteria and does not mean a reduced chance of conception in that treatment cycle.\r"

EPAT-factor was produced in vitro by mouse embryos from the 1-cell stage to the expanded blastocyst stage. The human study involved a \"blind\" analysis of serum samples, collected from in vitro fertilization-treated patients, for the presence of thrombocytopenic activity. Results suggest that measurement of this thrombocytopenic activity might be useful as an index of embryo viability and might be clinically applicable for the monitoring of implantation success in in vitro fertilization programs.\r"

  ".W": "We describe in physiological terms the increasing glomerular capillary wall (GCW) dysfunction of 20 patients with diabetic glomerulopathy and heavy proteinuria. The clearances of uncharged polysaccharide markers of graded size were used to probe the glomerular filter on three occasions over a 24-mo period. The findings were analyzed with a theoretical model of solute transport that depicts most of the GCW as an isoporous membrane and the minor portion as a nondiscriminatory shunt pathway. Initially, the mean glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient Kf is computed to have been 3-5 times lower and mean pore radius of the major membrane component (r0) 2 A smaller than normal control values. In contrast, the model computes the fraction of filtrate volume permeating the nondiscriminatory shunt pathway (omega 2) to have been sixfold elevated above control values and to have correlated strongly in individual patients with the fractional clearances of albumin (r = .72) and of IgG (r = .73). Sequential studies after 12 and 24 mo revealed an invariable decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fractional clearances of albumin and IgG increased with time in most patients but declined in a few instances (20-25%). Change in omega 2 tended to occur in parallel with fractional protein clearance, regardless of its direction. We conclude that in progressive diabetic glomerulopathy GFR declines because of a loss by glomerular capillaries of ultrafiltration capacity, proteinuria is largely a consequence of increasingly impaired barrier-size selectivity, and the foregoing injuries reflect damage to different parts of the GCW and may become dissociated from one another with the passage of time.\r"

All patients had overt diabetic nephropathy with increased urinary albumin excretion and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA was in the range of 16-50 ml X min-1 X 1.73 m-2. All patients received antihypertensive treatment. A combined light- and electron-microscope study was performed. A significant proportion of the glomeruli was totally occluded (mean 36%, range 24-67%). Structural data presented relate only to the open, still-functioning glomeruli. Comparison with data previously obtained showed that the thickness of the peripheral basement membrane [647 nm, coefficient of variation (C.V.) 0.22] was more than twice the normal value (310 nm, C.V. 0.08); the width of epithelial foot processes (352 nm, C.V. 0.07) was significantly greater than in normal biopsies (224 nm, C.V. 0.06); and the mean volume of the open glomeruli was markedly increased compared with normal and clearly exceeded that in the early diabetic hypertrophy. Total mesangial volume and total basement membrane material per open glomerulus were increased by 277 and 614%, respectively. However, capillary length and surface per open glomerulus were similar to those observed in early diabetic hypertrophy. These findings suggest that a late glomerular hypertrophy with preservation of capillary surface occurs as a compensatory phenomenon, prolonging renal survival for diabetic nephropathy patients.\r"

Total GAG content in glomeruli from diabetic rats and in the basement membranes prepared from these samples (17.22 +/- 1.45 and 6.56 +/- 0.49 micrograms/10(5) glomeruli, respectively was significantly less than that found in comparable control preparations (43.71 +/- 3.35 and 16.05 +/- 1.41 micrograms/10(5) glomeruli, respectively). The portion of total GAG in the water-soluble fraction recovered after osmotic lysis of isolated glomeruli was also markedly decreased in diabetic samples (26.11 +/- 4.55 vs. 3.30 +/- 0.32 micrograms/10(5) glomeruli, control vs. diabetic). Treatment of lysed glomeruli with the ionic detergent deoxycholate, required for liberation of the extracellular matrix from plasma membrane lipoproteins and purification of the insoluble glomerular basement membrane (GBM), resulted in solubilization of approximately 10% of the water-insoluble GAG in control samples but greater than 50% in diabetic membranes. Heparan sulfate comprised greater than 90% of the GAGs in both control and diabetic GBM, defined as the water- and detergent-insoluble matrix. The findings clearly demonstrate that the GAG content of GBM is diminished in experimental diabetes and provide evidence that the reduction in GBM anionic sites associated with diabetes derives from a decrease in the constituent GAGs of this extracellular matrix. The results further suggest that the interaction between GBM and populations of GAG associated with the surface of plasma membranes of adjacent cells is disturbed in diabetes.\r"

To investigate the role of glucose concentration 1 h after a 50-g challenge on the risk of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), 6394 nondiabetic men were followed for 12 yr for the first development of CHD. The rate of fatal CHD increased linearly with amount of glucose. Men in the fourth quintile of postchallenge glucose (157-189 mg/dl) had twice the age-adjusted risk of fatal CHD of those in the lowest quintile (P less than .05). Relative risk increased to threefold among those in the top quintile and remained statistically significant after adjustment for other risk factors including body mass, total cholesterol, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hematocrit (P less than .001). When glucose was considered as a linear term in the proportional hazards model, a highly significant relation was noted with fatal CHD alone and when combined with nonfatal MI (P less than .001). We conclude that a continuously increasing risk gradient exists between postchallenge glucose and subsequent CHD that is independent of other known risk factors.\r"

AG concentrations in the nondiabetic patients indicated that the mean value of normal AG concentration was 21.8 micrograms/ml (SD = 5.9 micrograms/ml, range 9.6-38.8 micrograms/ml). This distribution of AG concentration was significantly different from that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (13.3 +/- 5.4 micrograms/ml) and definitely different from that in diabetic patients (2.1 +/- 1.8 micrograms/ml). In a standard glucagon test, it was suggested that the decrease of plasma AG was affected not only by glycemic control of the patients but also by pancreatic cell secretory activity. The reduction of AG concentration was more marked in IDDM patients than in NIDDM patients. In longitudinal studies, AG concentration was shown to be sensitive to glycemic control. However, its recovery showed a tendency toward much delay after the improvement of fasting blood glucose or HbA1 concentrations. On the other hand, AG concentration showed negligible diurnal change and no immediate change as a result of diet, oral glucose load, or acute shift of the insulin level in both normal and diabetic subjects.\r"

From this study population, 487 volunteered, and 229 were enrolled to comprise the study sample. A random sample of Nisei men was also drawn from the population to develop a reference sample of 189 men. All subjects participated in a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test; the National Diabetes Data Group (NDDG) and World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria as well as a modification of the WHO criteria were used to classify individuals with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or diabetes. Within the study sample, 79 men were found to have normal glucose tolerance, 72 had IGT, and 78 had type II diabetes. The mean age of the study sample was 61.4 yr. Based on comparison of the study sample to the reference sample, the study sample was ascertained to be representative of Nisei men in King County. Extrapolating from our observations in the reference sample and in the study sample, we have estimated that approximately 56% of Nisei men in the study population have abnormal glucose tolerance. Much of this is undiagnosed because only approximately 13% of the reference sample of Nisei men reported a prior diagnosis of diabetes. Of the men who enrolled in the study as nondiabetic subjects, 11.1% had diabetes and 39.2% had IGT; i.e., 50.3% had previously unknown abnormalities in glucose tolerance. We estimate that approximately 20% of Nisei men have diabetes (both previously diagnosed and undiagnosed) and approximately 36% have IGT.\r"

  ".W": "In a study sample of 229 second-generation Japanese-American (Nisei) men, 79 with normal glucose tolerance, 72 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 78 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes, we have determined prevalence rates for certain conditions (ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) associated with diabetes. All subjects participated in a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria and information from the subject's medical history and personal physician were used to classify the subjects. Retinopathy was observed only in diabetic men in the study sample (11.5% of diabetic men). Furthermore, it was observed only in men who were receiving drug treatment for diabetes--40.0% of insulin-treated and 17.2% of sulfonylurea-treated men. Electrophysiologic evidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed in 46.2% of diabetic men and in 4.0% of nondiabetic (normal and IGT) men. For diabetic men with fasting serum glucose greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl, 63.8% had peripheral neuropathy and 19.1% had retinopathy, whereas for diabetic men with fasting serum glucose less than 140 mg/dl, 19.4% had neuropathy and none had retinopathy. For diabetic men with a diabetes duration of greater than or equal to 10 yr, 72.7% had neuropathy and 31.8% had retinopathy; with a diabetes duration of 5-9 yr, 70.6% had neuropathy and 11.8% had retinopathy; and with a diabetes duration of less than 5 yr, 20.5% had neuropathy and none had retinopathy. Nephropathy was distinctly uncommon, and among the measurements of kidney function, only proteinuria was clearly abnormal with diabetes. Prevalence rates of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease were highest in Nisei men with diabetes, lowest in men with normal glucose tolerance, and intermediate in men with IGT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diabetes-prone (BBdp) and normal (BBn) BB rats received either oral cyclosporin (10 mg X kg-1 X day-1 or its vehicle from age 30-150 days. Six of 21 (29%) vehicle-treated rats became glycosuric, with hyperglycemia, weight loss, and unremitting insulin requirements, and showed destruction of islet beta-cells. Five of 24 (21%) cyclosporin-treated rats became glycosuric, but none demonstrated weight loss, all required insulin only intermittently after onset, and all showed persistence of islet beta-cells. Cyclosporin induced hypoinsulinemic glucose intolerance in BBn rats. Cyclosporin inhibited the normal rise with age of peripheral blood lymphocyte cell numbers, identified with monoclonal antibodies. OX19+ (pan-T) and W3/25+ helper T-lymphocytes were affected, and there was an increase in the large W3/13+ OX19- population characteristic of BBdp rats; in addition, this subset appeared in BBn rats. Cyclosporin also caused the appearance and/or increase in both BBdp and BBn rats of W3/25+ OX19- and OX8+ OX19- subsets. Suppressor/cytotoxic (OX8+) T-lymphocytes and Ia+ cells were less affected. The incidence of hyperglycemia and glycosuria was therefore unaltered by cyclosporin, although the diabetic syndrome was milder. BBn rats receiving cyclosporin showed glucose intolerance, suggesting that in BBdp rats, the net effects of immunosuppression on beta-cell destruction may have been counterbalanced by the direct effect on the same cells. The attenuation of diabetes in BBdp rats occurred through further immunosuppression rather than by correction of its preexisting immunodeficiency.\r"

Binding was reduced approximately 60% when GBM was pretreated with collagenase and approximately 24% when pretreated with chondroitinase plus heparinase. Treatment with NaCl had little effect on binding, whereas reduction with beta-mercaptoethanol removed approximately 25% of the bound 125I-fibronectin. Binding to samples prepared from rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes was significantly increased compared with that observed with control preparations at all concentrations of fibronectin and of basement membrane tested. The findings provide direct evidence that fibronectin binds to GBM and that this binding, which represents a biologic function of the protein, is enhanced in diabetes.\r"

Prolongation of the T1 relaxation time reflects increased rotation of water in a magnetic field, consistent with an extracellular site of the additional water. Simultaneous feeding of sorbinil to inhibit aldose reductase resulted in normalization of both total nerve water and of the prolongation of T1 relaxation time. These data define the NMR-spectroscopic state of endoneurial edema in the galactose-fed rat and suggest specific application to the investigation of the role of aldose reductase in human diabetic neuropathy.\r"

A sample survey of undergraduate students (N = 570) reveals significant associations between violence and neglect within the family and social psychological measures of self, interaction patterns, and perception of parents. The overall results of this study indicate that the dynamics of abuse and neglect are similar regardless of social class context.

  ".W": "A group of 317 overweight men and 565 overweight women was compared with an age-matched normal control group of 444 men and 627 women in order to establish whether hypertension was more often recorded in the obese group. This was done by analysing the continuous morbidity registration of four general practices with a follow-up of up to 17 years. The risk of hypertension was found to be three to four times higher in overweight persons than in those of normal weight, and in women a linear relationship was found between the degree of overweight and the incidence of hypertension. The fat distribution was studied in 292 overweight persons, and fat deposited predominantly in the abdominal region was found to be related to the prevalence of hypertension, particularly in subjects under 50 years of age. Along with the degree of overweight, therefore, the fat distribution might be a useful aid in the early detection of hypertension. Since it is difficult to achieve long-term success in the treatment of overweight, its prevention merits special attention in general practice.\r"

Home visits were undertaken by health teams to introduce the clinic and record demographic and sociomedical data. Families were invited to attend the clinic for a complete health examination. It was largely a young population with an average family size of 7.1. The houses were generally overcrowded. The majority of the heads of families had no formal education or skilled occupation but 98.1% had gainful employment. The vital statistics of the population, though comparable to the national figures, reflect a better health status. The infant mortality rate of the reference population was 25.9 per 1000 live births compared with 32.8 for the whole of Libya. Most reproductive age women (81.5%) breast fed their children for six months or more and 4% used contraceptives. The overall morbidity rate was 255 per 1000 population and the morbidity pattern, with a predominance of infections, was typical of a developing country. Each case diagnosed during the survey was appropriately treated and those with chronic diseases are being followed up. It is felt that such family based comprehensive health care units will go a long way in providing primary health care throughout Libya.\r"

The frequency of documented sigmoidoscopy in this group of active patients over the age of 50 years was 4.8%. A similar low frequency for the performance of skin biopsy was also observed. All 15 senior residents participated in an attitude survey and a timed exercise in which they sought to find the necessary items for performance of a skin biopsy. In a questionnaire the group agreed that sigmoidoscopy and skin biopsies were procedures appropriate for their family practice goals. In their offices, these residents required over nine minutes to partially locate equipment chosen for skin biopsy. The attitude survey revealed few constraints other than insufficient time to perform indicated elective procedures. Further study of procedure room utilization and family physicians' office surgery skills is recommended.\r"

The prescription data analysed in the study came from 68 general practitioners operating in south Verona and have been collected by 14 community pharmacies located in the same area. Benzodiazepine hypnotics were the most commonly prescribed drugs, followed by antidepressants and neuroleptics both in 1983 and in 1984. The distribution of the general practitioners in terms of low, medium and high prescribers was examined by analysing the rates of prescriptions per registered patient. The rates were obtained for the total number of prescriptions and also for each of the three different classes of psychotropic drug. The proportion of low and high prescribers decreased from 1983 to 1984 (18.3 versus 11.7 and 26.7 versus 16.7 for low and high prescribers respectively); this change was mainly due to the reduction in benzodiazepine prescriptions. No significant correlation was found between the rates of psychotropic drug prescriptions and list size. The monthly variation in prescription of the three drug classes followed a similar pattern during the two years; the fluctuations were clearly cyclical, more definitely in 1984 than in 1983 where the most relevant feature was the summer trough.\r"

The sample consisted of 168 patients of six experienced general practitioners from training practices, and 326 patients of six trainee general practitioners. Talk in the consultations of trainees and experienced doctors was similar in many respects, including total quantity of talk per consultation. However, twice as many patients of the trainees than those of the experienced doctors produced questions and comments which followed from something already said by the doctor. In addition, the trainees were more likely than the experienced doctors to ask the patients questions about the suggested treatment, rather than simply to offer instructions and advice. These features of doctors' and patients' behaviour were significantly correlated with each other for both the trainees and the experienced doctors. It is suggested that the strategy of engaging patients in discussion about treatment, used more by the trainees, encouraged patients to think of queries which otherwise might not have occurred to them during the consultation.\r"

Seventy per cent of new users of psychotropic drugs were women and 67% were suffering significant psychological distress according to the 12-item general health questionnaire administered in a home interview.

One method of increasing awareness and improving performance is peer group audit. Such an initiative was taken by the Vale of Trent faculty of the Royal College of General Practitioners. Of the 240 members 140 (58%) responded to a questionnaire about smear policy and organization. Seventy-six practices, which included 101 members (42%) reviewed a sample of 100 records of women aged 35-64 years. Performance was estimated by noting the number in each sample who had never had a smear taken and the number who had had a smear taken in the last five years. Wide variations in performance were found, little of which could be explained by the variables measured. Practices with an active call system produced slightly higher coverage rates. The value of such an audit is discussed and suggestions made for facilitating this approach.\r"

Cognitive, not behavioural skills predominate. Many tutors have little or no grounding in adult education. The career intentions of trainees tend to be overshadowed by their immediate service role. This essay explores the integrated structure of general practice training. The author draws on his experience of 10 years as tutor in Sydney suburban and Tasmanian country practice, and now as State Director of training. He is a student in the University Centre for Education. Four essentials to be considered are: a highly motivated vocational trainee, a comprehensive negotiated curriculum emphasizing behaviour, a wealth of selected experience in refined training positions, and skilled tutors. The essay makes no attempt at an exhaustive analysis of becoming a general practitioner. The purpose is to address these critical features of training, and to argue for an approach in tune with the trainee's vision; comprehensive, valid and reliable; not a matter of chance.\r"

The incidence of HLA antigen A3, a marker of the hemochromatosis allele, was identical in the sporadic patients (23.8%), in the familial patients (22.2%), and in the controls (24.5%). Furthermore, no clinical difference could be found between A3 and non-A3 patients. These results demonstrate no systematic association between hemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda in the population studied. Another HLA-linked gene, however, could be implicated in the expression of the disease as HLA antigen DR7 presented an incidence statistically different (p less than 0.05) between sporadic (16.6%) and familial patients (43%).\r"

  ".W": "Five hundred twelve (373 men, 139 women) patients, aged 1-75 yr, with chronic hepatitis B virus infection seen during a 5-yr period were analyzed. Of these, 43.8% were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive, 49.2% were positive for hepatitis B e antibody, and 7% were negative for both HBeAg and hepatitis B e antibody at presentation. The cumulative probability of clearing HBeAg at the end of the first, second, and third years was 17%, 30%, and 34%, respectively. The probability of clearing HBeAg increased with the age of the patients. Reversion to HBeAg occurred in 7.8% of patients who were HBeAg-negative at presentation and 32.3% of HBeAg-positive patients who cleared HBeAg. In 70.6% of these patients, serum hepatitis B virus-deoxyribonucleic acid was persistently positive or became detectable at the time of HBeAg reversion. Most reversions occurred during the \"e-window\" phase. The reversions were transient in 31.8% of the cases. Recognition of the dynamics of these serologic changes is important in the evaluation of therapeutic regimens aimed at suppression of HBV replication and call for controlled trials with adequate duration of follow-up. Biochemical exacerbation of liver disease accompanied 38.7% of HBeAg to hepatitis B e antibody seroconversions and 34.8% of reversions. Such exacerbations may be mistaken for acute attacks of hepatitis B in patients not previously recognized to be hepatitis B surface antigen carriers and, in the absence of serial serologic data, are indistinguishable from superimposed non-A, non-B hepatitis.\r"

Radioimmunoassays for the detection of serologic markers of hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis delta virus, and molecular hybridization techniques for the detection of serum hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid and hepatitis delta virus ribonucleic acid were used. Based on the results of an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (Corzyme-M), 563 cases were diagnosed as acute hepatitis B and 45 as acute hepatitis superimposed on hepatitis B surface antigen carriage. Development of the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was observed in only 1 (0.2%) of the 507 cases with acute hepatitis B that were followed. In contrast, hepatitis B surface antigen persisted in all the latter cases. Acute hepatitis superimposed on hepatitis B surface antigen carriage was attributed to hepatitis A virus superinfection in 2 (4.4%), hepatitis delta virus superinfection in 22 (48.9%), reactivation of chronic type B hepatitis in 12 (26.7%), seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen-positive to anti-hepatitis B e antibody-positive in 2 (4.4%), presumed superinfection by non-A, non-B agent(s) in 6 (13.4%), and the first clinical manifestation of chronic active hepatitis in 1 (2.2%) case. These data show that acute clinical hepatitis B in adults seems to be a self-limited disease and rarely leads to the development of the carrier state in this epidemiologic setting and hepatitis delta virus superinfection and spontaneous reactivation of chronic hepatitis B are the principal causes of acute hepatitis superimposed in hepatitis B surface antigen carriers in an area with a moderately high prevalence of hepatitis B virus infections.\r"

To define this effect, we measured renal clearances in patients with chronic liver disease and ascites and in nonascitic controls. Furosemide (80 mg i.v.) transiently increased p-aminohippurate clearance in controls (from 693 +/- 67 to 928 +/- 93 ml/min) and in 11 patients with ascites (from 418 +/- 81 to 526 +/- 80 ml/min). In contrast, in 13 patients with ascites, p-aminohippurate clearance fell by 34% (from 545 +/- 51 to 360 +/- 24 ml/min) within 20 min and by 41% within 60 min, and inulin clearance fell by 19% at 20 min and by 30% at 60 min. The renal effects lasted approximately 4 h. The renal response could not be predicted by renin activity, urinary prostaglandin excretion, urinary sodium, or clinical characteristics. In all 14 patients who received oral furosemide, p-aminohippurate clearance fell within 90 min (by 24%) and remained suppressed for at least 4 h. These immediate effects of furosemide on renal perfusion may contribute to azotemia in some patients with ascites.\r"

Binding sites for polymerized human serum albumin have been found to be encoded by the pre-s2 region of the hepatitis B virus genome.

In sera from patients with acute hepatitis B, pre-s1 and pre-s2 antigen occurred in 16 of 20 and 15 of 20 patients, respectively. In the initial stage of the disease, pre-S gene products correlated with binding sites for polymerized human serum albumin, but not with hepatitis B surface antigen. Subsequently, pre-s1 and pre-s2 antigens were cleared from the serum of patients with acute hepatitis B before binding sites for polymerized human serum albumin and hepatitis B surface antigen. Possibly, the early clearance of pre-S markers can be of prognostic value in acute hepatitis B. The mechanisms of the early clearance of the pre-S antigens in acute hepatitis B remain to be elucidated. However, elimination by immunologic mechanisms appears likely.\r"

  ".W": "The clinicopathologic features and natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis were reviewed in 53 patients followed at the Yale Liver Center during the past 30 yr. At presentation, the mean age of patients was 46 yr, and the male to female ratio was 1.4:1. Biliary sclerosis was limited to the intrahepatic ductal system in 21% of the patients. Fifty-three percent of the patients had mild disease without portal hypertension at presentation, and 25% had no symptoms attributable to their liver disease. Long-term follow-up was available for 42 patients and averaged 56 mo. Over this period, 16 patients remained mildly symptomatic, and 11 were asymptomatic. Survival was calculated by a Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and demonstrated that 75% of the patients were alive 9 yr after the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. A multivariate analysis of clinical features revealed that hepatomegaly and a serum bilirubin level greater than 1.5 mg/dl at the onset of disease were independent discriminators of a poor prognosis. Patients referred to this university medical center displayed different clinical characteristics than previously reported in primary sclerosing cholangitis. A higher percentage were older, female, and asymptomatic, and more had disease limited to the intrahepatic ductal system. Survival was also considerably improved in this group of patients and suggests that the long-term prognosis for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis may be considerably better than previously believed.\r"

When the lumen of esophagus and duodenum were perfused with acid (pH 2) luminal and mucosal pH values were 2.18 +/- 0.11 and 4.08 +/- 0.41 in esophagus, 2.57 +/- 0.15 and 6.74 +/- 0.13 in duodenal bulb, and 2.44 +/- 0.14 and 6.39 +/- 0.2 in duodenal loop. Juxtamucosal pH in fundus, body, and duodenum remained near neutral when luminal pH was 1.5, but in distal esophagus and antrum it fell sharply at luminal pH values below 3. In duodenal ulcer patients juxtamucosal pH in the cap was significantly lower than that in normals at luminal pH values below 3. These studies support the hypothesis that a \"mucus-bicarbonate\" barrier inhibits mucosal acidification in humans and that duodenal mucosa in ulcer patients is less able to maintain a neutral zone adjacent to it in the face of luminal acid.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been related more to dysmotility of the colon than to abnormalities of the small intestine. To look for small bowel abnormalities, we recorded ultraluminal pressures in 16 patients with IBS. All patients complained of abdominal pain, and diarrhea (n = 8) or constipation (n = 8) were also prominent symptoms. Comparable studies were performed on 16 age-matched controls. The observations include diurnal and nocturnal fasting recordings and the response to a fatty meal. Periodicities of the interdigestive migrating myoelectric complexes were shorter in IBS (p less than 0.05); this was due to much shorter diurnal cycles in patients with diarrhea (77 +/- 10 min) than those with constipation (118 +/- 15 min) or controls (113 +/- 10 min, both p less than 0.05). All groups exhibited circadian changes, with nocturnal cycles being more frequent. Two specific patterns of small bowel motor activity were more common in IBS--ileal propulsive waves and clusters of jejunal pressure activity (both p less than 0.05 compared to controls). Moreover, cramping abdominal pain was usually noted in IBS when ileal motility was propulsive; jejunal bursts were also sometimes associated with abdominal symptoms. We conclude that motility of the small intestine is modified in some patients with IBS and that certain motor patterns are related to their symptoms.\r"

Seventy-six patients received active medication and 77 received a placebo. There were 20 dropouts (6 in the active group and 14 in the placebo group) during the study because of insufficient efficacy. After 6 wk of therapy, 48 of the 76 patients (63%) receiving 5-aminosalicylic acid were considered to be \"much improved\" by the study physician compared to 22 of the 77 patients (29%) on placebo (p = 0.001). A disease activity index based on patient symptoms and sigmoidoscopic appearance was used to assess efficacy. Mean disease activity index declined 55% for patients on 5-aminosalicylic acid and 24% for patients on placebo (p = 0.0001). Analysis of subgroups indicated that patients most likely to respond were those with disease confined to the 20-40 cm from the anus. Response was not affected by concurrent sulfasalazine, but patients requiring concurrent oral steroids had a diminished response. Rapid onset of efficacy was shown by a significant reduction in rectal bleeding within 3 days of treatment initiation. 5-Aminosalicylic acid enemas are well tolerated and are of benefit in the treatment of ulcerative colitis confined to the distal colon.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cisapride on gastric emptying, esophageal emptying, gastrointestinal symptoms, and glycemic control were evaluated in 20 insulin-dependent diabetics who had delayed gastric emptying of the solid or liquid component of a meal, or both. A double-isotope technique was used to measure gastric emptying, and esophageal emptying was measured as the time for a bolus of the solid meal to enter the stomach. On 2 days each patient received cisapride (20 mg) or placebo orally, 60 min before an esophageal and gastric emptying test. A third gastric and esophageal emptying test was performed after each patient had orally taken 10 mg of cisapride or placebo q.i.d. for 4 wk. Single-dose cisapride increased esophageal emptying (p less than 0.01) and both solid and liquid gastric emptying (p less than 0.001). The response to cisapride was most marked in patients with the greatest delay in esophageal and gastric emptying (p less than 0.05). After administration of cisapride for 4 wk, gastric emptying of solid and liquid were faster (p less than 0.001), but esophageal emptying was not significantly different from the placebo test. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms were less after cisapride (p less than 0.05), whereas there was no change on placebo (p greater than 0.2). Plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations were not different after cisapride compared with placebo. These results indicate that single-dose cisapride increases esophageal emptying in insulin-dependent diabetics and that chronic administration of cisapride is effective in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.\r"

Gel filtration of antral and duodenal extracts on Sephadex G-50 revealed multiple molecular forms of immunoreactive glycine-extended processing intermediates corresponding to known molecular forms of gastrin and cholecystokinin. Immunoaffinity chromatography studies of antral mucosal and gastrinoma extracts identified a molecular form of glycine-extended processing intermediates that was characterized by an amino terminus identical to that of gastrin heptadecapeptide. Large differences in the relative contents of precursors and products of gastrin synthesis were found in gastrinoma tissue as compared to gastrointestinal mucosal extracts. These studies suggest the potential importance of glycine-extended peptides as intermediates in the posttranslational processing of gastrin and cholecystokinin in humans and indicate that gastrin processing mechanisms may be altered in Zollinger-Ellison tumors.\r"

  ".W": "We have established an experimental model of chronic gastric ulcer, in rats which transection of the lower horizontal portion of the duodenum and anastomosis of the forestomach to the upper part of the jejunum caused regurgitation of all duodenal juice into the stomach. After 3, 6, 12, and 30 wk, all treated rats developed an ulcer in the prepyloric region on the lesser curvature of the stomach. More than half of the antrum was finally involved in the ulcer. Histologic studies revealed chronic ulcers quite similar to human ones. As a control series, transection at the pylorus failed to produce an ulcer. Although many papers have appeared regarding the experimental production of chronic gastric ulcer, most of the studies reported have applied chemicals, drugs, or mechanical injury to the gastric mucosa. Our model produced chronic regurgitation of duodenal juice as a natural phenomenon, and uniformly resulted in ulcer formation. Intragastric total bile acid concentrations were significantly elevated in the reflux group. Serum gastrin levels, the thickness of the fundic mucosa, and the height of fundic gland were also significantly increased. Thus, the detergent action of bile acids and the increased acid secretion were assumed to play an important role in ulcer formation. Further studies using this model are warranted on the pathogenesis of chronic peptic ulceration.\r"

  ".W": "The cyclic myoelectric activity of the gastroduodenal area and the antral mucosal ionic permeability, measured by the transmural potential difference, were simultaneously evaluated in the dog. These parameters were recorded before and after section of the omental attachments to the pyloric area, section of the terminal antrum, and excision of a 2-cm segment at the pylorus. None of the surgical procedures modified the duration of the postprandial disruption of the migrating motor complexes, whereas the potential difference was increased. In fasted dogs resection of the omentum increased the migrating motor complex intervals and the duration of the phase of regular spiking activity; however, the regular spiking activities still occurred in a sequential manner. Transection of the terminal antrum was associated with a decrease in duration of the regular spiking activity phases that started simultaneously on the antrum and duodenum, without changes in the migrating motor complex intervals, and prevented the occurrence of the increase in potential difference associated with feeding. After pylorectomy, the migrating motor complex intervals were reduced by 46% on both antrum and duodenum. Our observation that only pylorectomy was able to consistently increase the frequency of migrating motor complexes suggests a pyloric inhibition of the normal pacing of the cyclic motor events at both antral and duodenal levels.\r"
