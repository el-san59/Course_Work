  ".W": "With membrane-enriched fractions prepared from human metastatic breast tissue used as immunogen, a group of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were generated that recognized several distinct antigens on breast and other carcinomas. The antibodies were found to react with established human tumor cells in culture as well as in immunohistochemical protocols using sections of primary and metastatic lesions. One MAb, B72.3, demonstrated a high degree of selective reactivity for human carcinomas in that no reactivity was found with a large number of different normal tissues. These MAbs were used to demonstrate the heterogeneity of expression of the tumor antigens as well as the intrinsic cellular factors (i.e., cell-cycle kinetics and clonal variability) that modulate their expression. Additional studies showed that recombinant human leukocyte interferon can act as a potent regulator of surface antigen expression on human carcinoma cells. Analysis of these cells by radioimmunoassay or flow cytometry revealed that interferon treatment resulted in a higher percentage of the cell population that bind the MAb to the surface antigen. Furthermore, interferon treatment also increases the level of expression for particular tumor antigen throughout the tumor cell population. Experimental models were also developed to investigate the active localization of a radiolabeled MAb by a human tumor xenograft in athymic mice. The results demonstrate active uptake of an 125I-B6.2 by a transplantable human breast tumor that expressed significant quantities of the B6.2-reactive 90 kD tumor antigen. In contrast, a human melanoma cell line grown as a solid, subcutaneous tumor in athymic mice did not localize the labeled B6.2 and does not express the associated 90 kD antigen. We report the generation and characterization of anti-breast carcinoma MAbs. These immunologic probes were used to study relevant breast tumor antigens, the factors that influence their level of expression, and the ability of human tumors grown in athymic mice to localize radiolabeled antibodies.\r"

  ".U": "87139651\r", 
  ".W": "Recent treatment strategies have been directed toward blockade of estrogen action or inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis as a means of inducing regression of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women is the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrone through the enzyme aromatase. It is known that aromatase activity increases proportionately with degree of obesity in women. To test the importance of this modulatory factor, we correlated body weight with estrogen excretion in our population of patients with breast cancer and found significant relationships. In situ production of estradiol from plasma precursors within breast cancer tissue may provide another source of estrogen. Major enzymes mediating estrogen biosynthesis were found to be present in tumor biopsy specimens. Aromatase activity was found to be present in 48/61 human tumors, sulfatase in 35/35, and 17 beta -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in 41/41. One inhibitor of aromatase, aminoglutethimide, has been extensively studied in patients with breast cancer. The additional effects of this drug on cholesterol side-chain cleavage and on 11-hydroxylase activity require coadministration of replacement glucocorticoid in treatment regimens. In pilot trials, 37% of patients experienced objective tumor regression with a combination of 1000 mg aminoglutethimide and 40 mg hydrocortisone daily. In randomized clinical trials with this regimen, aromatase inhibition with aminoglutethimide produced tumor regression with similar frequency as did surgical hypophysectomy, surgical adrenalectomy, or tamoxifen administration. The side effects of aminoglutethimide, including lethargy, skin rash, and ataxia complicate its use even though these problems are generally transient. Regimens of low-dose aminoglutethimide are being developed to reduce these side effects. Low-dose aminoglutethimide appears to block aromatase effectively and to have limited side effects, and is undergoing extensive clinical trial. A more specific aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandrostenedione, is now also being tested clinically, whereas MDL 18962, another new selective inhibitor, is undergoing study in animals.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibition of estrogen action at the target tissue level with the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, has proved highly successful in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer. In randomized clinical trials involving postmenopausal patients, tamoxifen has been found to be as effective as high-dose estrogens, androgens, progestins, and the aromatase inhibitor, aminoglutethimide. Because of its remarkable lack of significant toxicity, tamoxifen is now considered the first endocrine treatment of choice of hormone-responsive postmenopausal breast cancer. Although effective in a significant fraction of premenopausal patients, tamoxifen cannot be considered a substitute for ovariectomy because it usually does not suppress menses and because response to castration may occur after progression during antiestrogen therapy. Current evidence suggests that there is no major advantage in combining tamoxifen with other endocrine therapies or chemotherapy. At present, it appears preferable to use different modalities of endocrine therapy sequentially in those patients with hormone-responsive cancers. Chemotherapy should be delayed until maximum benefit has been obtained from endocrine therapy.\r"

In addition, for vasopressin, there is a glycopeptide as part of the prohormone. For each hormone the prohormone is packaged into neurosecretory granules and transported via axons to the posterior pituitary gland. In addition to this \"classic\" system, axons containing neurohypophyseal hormones project to the median eminence for release into portal vessels, and to other areas of the brain and spinal cord where the peptides may function as neurotransmitters rather than as hormones. As neurotransmitters, the neurohypophyseal hormones may be involved in the regulation of certain autonomic functions. Vasopressin and oxytocin are secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid where there is a diurnal rhythmic secretion of the peptides in several animal species (some species have a predominant rhythm of vasopressin and others a rhythm of oxytocin). Neurohypophyseal peptides are synthesized in some non-neuronal tissues where the function is unknown, and recently a novel peptide with similarities to oxytocin and vasotocin has been identified. The relationship of this novel peptide to the neurohypophyseal peptides is unknown. These new developments are likely to elucidate many new functions for the hormones of the neurohypophysis.\r"

There is immunologic evidence of two distinct types of serum binding proteins. The major binding protein complex (150,000 Mr) is growth hormone dependent. Binding proteins protect somatomedins from proteolytic degradation, retard plasma clearance, and decrease the availability to tissue receptors. The presence of serum binding proteins interferes with radioimmunoassays and radioreceptor assays for somatomedins. Proposed strategies to neutralize the interference from binding proteins without their elimination do not achieve this goal. Extraction of somatomedins by acid ethanol, hydrophobic absorption on C18 silicates (SepPak), and acid gel filtration are effective with human serum, but only acid gel filtration is satisfactory with rat serum. Failure to eliminate binding proteins from assays can lead to serious artifacts in conditions where abnormalities of binding proteins exist.\r"

Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, complement-dependent antibody lysis, and radioimmunoassay have been used in the past to detect AECA. We have developed a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect and characterize AECA. Sera were obtained from 28 normal volunteers, 28 patients with SLE, and 14 patients with PSS. We also performed studies in 47 patients with various monoclonal gammopathies. Endothelial cells (EC) were obtained from human umbilical veins by standard methods and subcultured on 96-well tissue culture plates without fixation. EC were then sequentially incubated with sera, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human Ig (IgG, IgM, or IgA), and substrate. Optical density readings were converted to arbitrary units by developing a standard curve. Heavy-chain specific antibodies were used to determine the class of AECA binding to EC. IgG was purified by using protein A columns and digested with pepsin to obtain F(ab')2 fragments. The mean units of AECA from normals were 19.3 for IgG and 12.5 for IgM. SLE sera showed significant levels of IgM AECA (37 units, P less than 0.001) but not IgG (29 units, P less than 0.1). PSS sera showed significant levels of both IgM AECA (38 units, P = 0.001) and IgG AECA (42.7 units, P less than 0.005). IgA AECA were not detected in normal, SLE, or PSS sera. Blocking Fc receptors with rabbit IgG did not affect the titer of IgG or IgM AECA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that renal prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis is regulated by angiotensin (AII), rabbits were given prolonged treatment with the AII analogue, Sar1-Ileu8AII (200 micrograms/kg/4 hr, subcutaneously), for 2 days during a low, normal, and high sodium intake. Sodium restriction augmented plasma renin activity (PRA), which was associated with a rise in basal renal PGE2 synthesis and urinary excretion, whereas sodium supplementation attenuated PRA with a decrease in renal PGE2 synthesis and urinary excretion. Sar1-Ileu8AII administration, with either a low, normal, or high salt intake, suppressed PRA. Sar1-Ileu8AII injection with a low sodium intake also suppressed renal PGE2 synthesis and excretion that was associated with a fall in blood pressure, suggesting an antagonistic action of this agent on vascular beds and renal PGE2 synthesis. On the other hand, with a high sodium intake Sar1-Ileu8-AII increased renal PGE2 synthesis and excretion as well as blood pressure, revealing an agonistic action of this compound under these conditions. The results suggest that exogenous AII analogue may act as an antagonist or agonist depending on sodium intake and endogenous AII levels, renal PGE2 synthesis is dependent on AII levels, either endogenously produced or exogenously administered (as an AII agonist), and the action of AII analogue on vascular beds and renal PGE2 synthesis does not appear to parallel its action on renin-AII feedback regulation at the juxtaglomerular cell especially under conditions of high sodium intake.\r"

The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.\r"

Cerebral edema was variable in these cases. Electron-dense knobs, 40 X 80 nm in size, which protruded from the membrane of infected erythrocytes, formed focal junctions between endothelial cells and erythrocytes. These junctions resulted in the entrapment of erythrocytes and caused blockage in the capillary lumen. Immunoperoxidase study revealed that P. falciparum antigens and IgG deposits in the capillary basement membrane.

This paper re-evaluates the available trials and considers benefits in the light of potential complications. Present evidence conclusively demonstrates that epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid administered in standard dosage, reduce the risk of rebleeding but, as a result of an increased incidence of ischaemic complications, do not benefit patients' outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Ten patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and action tremor were treated with isoniazid (INH) in a double-blind single crossover trial. The daily dose of INH administered during the 4-week treatment phase of the trial was determined by acetylator phenotype with slow acetylators receiving 12 mg/kg per day and rapid acetylators 20 mg/kg per day. Six of eight patients who completed the trial showed clinical improvement in the postural (alternating) tremor while on INH but the degree was minimal in all cases. Results of tremograms indicated that improvement also occurred in the intentional (synchronous) component of three patients while on INH, but this did not achieve statistical significance. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homocarnosine and ornithine were markedly elevated with INH therapy (providing evidence for substantial inhibition of GABA aminotransferase activity and increase in GABA in the CNS), but no correlation was found between the degree of GABA elevation in the CSF and the clinical response. Side effects were minimal and well tolerated. Although INH appears to have a limited therapeutic role, a trial is warranted in MS patients with postural tremor.\r"

  ".W": "We have constructed a computerized, totally automated system for measuring functional residual capacity (FRC) during mechanical ventilation, at any positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen. This system uses washout of a small amount (0.5 to 1.0%) of an insoluble, nontoxic tracer gas, sulfur hexafluoride, to measure FRC. It requires no modification of the ventilator and only minimal changes in the breathing circuit; it can be programmed to make measurements routinely without manual intervention. The system was evaluated with three tests. The prototype sulfur hexafluoride analyzer characteristic curve was determined, and the analyzer was evaluated to determine carbon dioxide interference. A comparison with nitrogen washout FRC measurements was made in an extensive bench test with a Plexiglas lung model. The bench test was designed to determine the effects of changing gas composition and minute volume. A study was done in six healthy dogs to determine reproducibility of the FRC measurements at four PEEP levels (0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O: two repetitions in each animal). The sulfur hexafluoride analyzer was well characterized by an exponential equation with a multiple r2 = 0.996. The analyzer was not affected by the presence of carbon dioxide (paired t test, t19 = 1.23, P greater than 0.10). The bench test indicated that FRC (measured) = 0.969 X FRC (true) - 5.3 ml. (Multiple r2 = 0.979.) This was significantly better than the nitrogen washout system, whose regression equation was also a function of minute volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Because short-latency evoked potentials are relatively resistant to anesthetic agents, they can be used to monitor neural pathways during surgical procedures. The use of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials to localize the central sulcus is an established aid of indisputable value in neurosurgical procedures involving cortical incisions for resection of certain epileptic foci, vascular malformations, or neoplasms near the central area of the brain. Likewise, recording of intraoperative nerve action potentials is currently regarded as indispensable in management of the neuroma-incontinuity after peripheral nerve trauma, as this evoked potential monitoring technique provides the only reliable method of distinguishing between axonotmetic and neurotmetic lesions. Evoked potential monitoring has been of value during many other types of surgical procedures, including cerebral aneurysm clipping, carotid endarterectomy, aortic procedures, microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm, acoustic neuroma resection, and a variety of spinal procedures. A detailed review of the literature is presented on the use of evoked potential monitoring for one of the more common indications: scoliosis surgery. Many orthopedic surgeons use the \"wake-up test\" only if the somatosensory evoked potentials change during surgery. A detailed review of the few reported cases of \"false negative\" evoked potentials is presented. The dearth of convincing reports of such phenomena in the face of so many positive experiences should persuade even the skeptical that monitoring of evoked potentials is a highly reliable and helpful intraoperative tool.\r"

  ".W": "Diethylstilbestrol (DES) can induce a recruitment into the proliferative pool of previously resting breast cancer cells in vivo. In order to verify if estrogenic recruitment could result in a larger tumor cell killing by chemotherapy, 117 patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive CEF (cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2; epidoxorubicin, 60 mg/m2; and 5-fluorouracil, 600 mg/m2 on day 1); DES-CEF (cyclophosphamide, 600 mg/m2 on day 1; DES, 1 mg orally on days 5, 6, and 7; and epidoxorubicin, 60 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil, 600 mg/m2, on day 8) every 21 days. No significant difference in objective response rates, survival, or progression-free survival was seen between the two regimens. Patients in the DES-CEF arm experienced a higher complete response (CR) rate (24.1% v 16.1%), which reached statistical significance in the case of soft-tissue metastasis (48% v 27.3%; P less than .05) and estrogen receptor-negative tumors (35.7% v 11.1%; P less than .025). Survival and progression-free survival of patients refractory to treatment were not worsened by estrogenic recruitment. In the subset of patients failing after adjuvant polychemotherapy, DES-CEF unexpectedly induced a significantly longer survival (greater than 802 days v 375 days; P = .029) and progression-free survival (239 days v 192 days; P = .041) than CEF. The DES-CEF regimen was more myelotoxic, and 43.3% of the DES-CEF cycles had to be delayed because of leukopenia in comparison with 11.8% of the CEF cycles (P less than .0001). In conclusion, chemotherapy with estrogenic recruitment was able to induce more CRs in certain subsets of patients and a significant prolongation in survival and progression-free survival of patients failing after adjuvant polychemotherapy. These results have been achieved despite a significantly lower dose intensity of chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cell activity and psychological status were measured at baseline and at 3 months into treatment, as part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Protocol 79-C-111, randomizing breast cancer patients to lumpectomy/radiation v mastectomy. Patients who were found to have positive axillary lymph nodes also received combination chemotherapy (Adriamycin [Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], plus Cytoxan [Mead Johnson Pharmaceuticals, Evansville, IN] or methotrexate, plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]). Seventy-five patients were entered onto this behavioral immunology protocol at the time of data analysis. We reported in an earlier publication that NK activity was an important predictor of patient baseline prognosis relevant to nodal status. In that study, by using multiple regression analyses, 51% of the baseline NK activity variance could be accounted for by entering three distress indicators into the equation (patient \"adjustment,\" lack of social support, and fatigue/depression symptoms). On reassessment of NK activity after 3 months, it was found that NK activity was not affected by the interim administration of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. However, consistent with our earlier findings, NK activity levels remained markedly lower in patients with positive nodes than in patients with negative nodes (at 60 to 1 effector to target cell [E:T] ratio, mean of 18% lytic activity v mean of 31% lytic activity [t = 1.87, P less than .05]). Even though average levels of NK activity were lower for patients with more tumor burden, there was still a substantial range of NK activity levels within the node positive patient group, as well as within the patient group as a whole. We hypothesized that differences in levels of NK activity could be predicted on the basis of baseline distress factors found to be significant in our earlier report. In fact, we found that we could account for 30% of NK activity level variance at 3 months follow-up on the basis of baseline NK activity, fatigue/depression, and lack of social support. Therefore, although neither radiation nor chemotherapy appeared to affect NK activity, tumor burden was again clearly associated with NK activity levels, and a significant amount of baseline and 3-month NK activity could be predicted on the basis of CNS-mediated effects. At the least, such factors provide a psychological marker of host biological status.\r"

We treated 47 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with a combination of amsacrine and HiDAc. The patients received amsacrine 200 mg/m2 daily for three days and, concurrently, HiDAc 3 g/m2 over three hours once daily for five days. Of 20 evaluable patients with AML in relapse, there were 12 remissions; of seven additional patients with primary refractory AML, there were two remissions, and of 12 patients with ALL in relapse, there were eight remissions. The three patients with blastic phase CML and the three patients with biphenotypic leukemia did not respond. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, hepatic dysfunction, and diarrhea were common, but cutaneous, conjunctival, and significant cerebellar and cerebral side effects were absent. We conclude that this regimen is highly effective therapy for AML and ALL and is also safe, eliminating the major toxicities encountered with HiDAc.\r"

  ".W": "At the present time, there is limited information on the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who relapse after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Intuitively, it might be expected that leukemia recurring after BMT would be refractory to further treatment. In an attempt to improve survival in patients with ALL who relapse after BMT, we used standard chemotherapy for reinduction and maintenance. Of 65 patients who relapsed following allogeneic, autologous, or syngeneic BMT, 12 elected to receive no further chemotherapy, and their median survival from relapse was 36 days (range 13 to 167 days). The 53 patients who received therapy had a significantly longer median survival of 168 days (range 18 days to 4.7 years). With multidrug induction regimens there were 29 of 52 (56%) complete remissions. Six patients are currently alive, with two off therapy. In the patients who received therapy, the following factors were independent predictors of prolonged survival: longer time from BMT to relapse; younger age at diagnosis; and the use of a preparative regimen containing fractionated total body irradiation. In conclusion, leukemia recurring after BMT remains sensitive to standard therapy in many patients. We recommend that patients with ALL who relapse after BMT receive reinduction and maintenance therapy as additional good quality survival time is achieved in patients who attain a remission.\r"

Seven of the 13 patients who had greater than or equal to 95% reduction in the leukemia cell mass, calculated using the bone marrow examination on day 6, achieved a complete remission (CR). These remissions lasted up to 14 months without additional therapy. There were no CRs among the 18 patients who had less than 95% cytoreduction by day 6. The sequential addition of 5-azacytidine (200 mg/m2/d) for three days in those patients with residual disease on day 6 provided little additional benefit. Nonhematological toxicity from mitoxantrone was mild, although fever and infection were common. A new high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay was used to describe the clinical pharmacokinetics of mitoxantrone. Neither clinical response nor toxicity was strongly correlated with the peak plasma mitoxantrone concentration on the first day (mean +/- SD, 510 +/- 206 ng/mL), nor the area under the concentration-time curve (484 +/- 229 ng X h/mL), nor the systemic clearance (405 +/- 124 mL/min/m2). Mitoxantrone causes rapid cytoreduction in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), but the optimal dose and schedule remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the effectiveness and reproducibility of T cell depletion in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow graft to prevent graft-v-host disease (GVHD), our multicentric study (nine different centers) investigated 62 consecutive patients with poor prognosis leukemia or hematosarcoma from June 1984 to November 1985. The data were updated October 1, 1986, and the mean follow-up was 18 +/- 4.3 months. T cells were depleted with a combination of 3-pan-T cell monoclonal antibodies (CD2 \"D66\"; CD5 \"A50\"; CD7 \"I21\") with a single incubation of rabbit complement (C'). The average number of T cells infused was 0.66 X 10(6) +/- 0.56/kg body weight. Twenty-six patients received chemoprophylaxis for GVHD, 16 received methotrexate, and ten received cyclosporin A. Only a single case of severe (greater than grade II) GVHD was observed, yet the incidence of graft failure was 19%. Factors that might have influenced the occurrence of graft failure appear to be the lack of radiotherapy in the conditioning regimen; the conditioning regimen itself (fractionated total body irradiation [TBI], 12 Gy, v single dose is better than TBI, 10 Gy, but still not statistically significant); and the age of the patients (high-risk after 30 years of age). In contrast, neither the number of nucleated cells reinfused nor the level of T cell depletion (provided the T cells were below critical numbers) seemed to have an influence, nor did chemoprophylaxis for GVHD or splenectomy in chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) patients. The survival of graft failure patients was very poor (one of 11; survival at 15 months of the initial graft). Thus, our study demonstrates the reproducibility and high effectiveness in preventing GVHD by immunodepletion of T cells in a large-scale multicentric assay, in which compliance with the protocol of immunodepletion was reasonably good. This study thus provides interesting clues to overcoming graft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Between August 1981 and July 1984, 93 patients with polychronotopic superficial papillary carcinoma (Ta and/or T1), flat carcinoma in situ (Tis), or concomitant superficial papillary and in situ bladder carcinoma were entered into a prospective randomized trial of maintenance v nonmaintenance intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy. Forty-six patients who received BCG weekly for 6 weeks were compared with 47 patients receiving the six-weekly doses of BCG plus monthly BCG for 2 years. Both groups were evaluated every 3 months by cytology, cystoscopy, and biopsy. A significant reduction in the number of recurrent tumors per patient-month was demonstrated for both groups (P less than .0001); however, the difference in reduction of tumors between the two groups was not significant. Additionally, patients receiving maintenance and nonmaintenance therapy had similar tumor recurrence and progression rates. These results indicate that monthly maintenance BCG does not prevent, delay, or reduce tumor recurrence or progression observed with the 6-week regimen. Maintenance BCG was associated with increased local toxicity, primarily dysuria, frequency, and urgency. Dosage reduction was required in 22 of 47 patients (46.8%). When the data were subjected to multivariate analysis, the presence or absence of tumor following induction BCG and PPD skin test results were found to be significant variables. Controlling for either the presence or absence of tumor following induction BCG, tumor recurrence and progression rates were not significantly different for the two treatment groups. However, the absence of tumor after induction BCG was associated with a longer disease-free duration (P = .00001) and time to progression (P = .095). Patients with a reactive tuberculin skin test before and after induction BCG had significantly less tumor recurrences than patients with different PPD skin tests results (P = .02). Tumor progression was not related to tuberculin skin testing.\r"

Following postoperative radiation therapy, 18 courses of methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were administered over 6 months. Fifty patients were registered. A total of 771 doses were administered. Dose reduction was required 72 times. Therapy was stopped in one patient (2%) because of toxicity. Three patients (6%) refused to complete the adjuvant therapy. Adjusted 2-year no evidence of disease (NED) survival is 66%. This study demonstrates that patients with advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck can undertake an aggressive program of adjuvant MTX/5-FU with acceptable compliance and toxicities. Preliminary data generated in this nonrandomized study support the call for a prospective randomized multiinstitutional trial of this program.\r"

  ".W": "Carboplatin, a cisplatin analogue, was administered as an intravenous (IV) one-hour infusion in a 4-consecutive weekly dose schedule to 44 patients with recurrent childhood brain tumors. Twenty-four patients were registered on our phase I, and 20 on our phase II studies. The maximum tolerable dose derived from our phase I study was 210 mg/m2/wk in patients with solid tumors, and the recommended dose for subsequent pediatric phase II studies was 175 mg/m2/wk. This dose was administered to 14 patients in the phase I and all 20 patients in the phase II study. Nine of 36 (25%) evaluable patients in the combined studies experienced objective responses for a median duration of 10+ months. Seven of nine responders had received prior cisplatin. Disease-specific response rates were as follows: medulloblastoma, six of 14 (43%) with three complete (CR) and three partial responses (PR); pineoblastoma, one of one (PR); germinoma, one of two (CR); and brainstem glioma, one of eight (13%) (PR). Carboplatin had mild emetic effects but no significant auditory or renal toxicity. Thrombocytopenia (less than 49,000) was encountered in nine of 28 (32%) evaluable trials at a dose of 175 mg/m2/wk. Because of its low potential for auditory, renal, and emetic toxicity, ease of administration, and high disease-specific activity, carboplatin deserves further study in multiagent phase II and III trials, especially in chemotherapy-sensitive diseases such as medulloblastoma.\r"

To test how well nebulizers meet this requirement, radiochemical purity of aerosols produced with a jet and an ultrasonic nebulizer was evaluated. The activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) and geometric standard deviation (sigma g) of radioaerosols were 0.46 micron (sigma g = 1.6) for the jet nebulizer and 0.70 micron (sigma g = 1.7) for the ultrasonic nebulizer. Paper and liquid chromatographic assays were obtained on the [99mTc]DTPA aerosol solute produced with each nebulizer. The results of these tests showed major differences in radiochemical purity. Aerosols produced in the jet nebulizer consistently showed greater than 90% of the radioactivity bound to the DTPA ligand whereas aerosols produced in the ultrasonic nebulizer showed less than 10% of the radioactivity bound to DTPA. The results support the need to test radiochemical purity of aerosols before using an aerosol nebulizer for pulmonary imaging and clearance studies.\r"

Profound alteration in the GFR results, but not the ERPF results, was also observed. Radiopharmaceutical breakdown was suspected and shown to be endogenous and due to hyperaluminemia at 28 ng/ml. These case findings add DTPA to the list of 99mTc radiopharmaceuticals that have previously been reported to have altered biodistribution when hyperaluminemia is present.

Each method has its utility, examples of which will be discussed along with the methods' limitations. All of the methods have value in furthering our understanding of the metabolism of monoclonal antibodies both in vivo and in vitro.

Three groups of three rats each were fed AIN-76 diet. Each group received an oral supplement of either 0, 2, or 12 mg of retinol. Retinol and retinyl esters were measured in the whole liver, in hepatocytes isolated either by gravity sedimentation or by centrifugal elutriation, and in the supernatant solution recovered after hepatocyte sedimentation. Dietary supplementation with vitamin A increased the liver stores from 138 to 390 micrograms/g. A mean of 5% of the liver vitamin A was found in hepatocytes isolated by centrifugal elutriation. This percentage tended to decrease as liver vitamin A increased. In contrast, a mean of 38% of total liver vitamin A was found in hepatocytes isolated by gravity sedimentation over a threefold range of liver reserves. Whereas the retinol concentration in hepatocytes remained constant, the percentage of total vitamin A as retinyl esters, which accounted for more than 96% of the total vitamin A, increased as liver stores increased. The retinyl ester composition was similar in all three groups, major esters being palmitate (76-82%), stearate (9-12%), oleate (5-7%), and linoleate (3-4%). Over a threefold range of liver vitamin A concentrations in well-nourished rats, therefore, we estimate that only 10-20% of the total vitamin A in liver is present in the parenchymal cells.\r"

Twelve infants are alive with functioning grafts (10 primary and two second transplants) after 4 months to 7.5 years. To assess the long-term outcome, we analyzed growth and development in the first nine infants 2 to 7.5 years after receiving their first transplant. Before transplantation, head circumference and height standard deviation scores in six of nine infants were less than -2. Five had seizures; four had delayed mental development, and six delayed motor development. The mean increment in height standard deviation scores for six boys after transplantation was +1.4 (P less than 0.05), and one achieved complete catch-up growth. The mean difference in height standard deviation scores for three infant girls with primary hyperoxaluria was -2.1; nevertheless, two infants with oxalosis are currently alive 2.7 to 3.3 years later. All eight surviving children achieved normal head circumference (mean improvement +2.2 SDS, P less than 0.001), and no child had further seizures. Of seven infants reassessed with the Bayley Scales after transplantation, mental development was normal in all and motor development was normal in five. Our findings suggest that early living related renal transplantation is an important option in the management of end-stage renal disease in infants.\r"

Growth was analyzed both during the prepubertal period and during puberty. Height at transplantation was greater than 2 SD below the mean in 34.2% of prepubertal children. After the first posttransplant year, 59.2% of the prepubertal children had a normal height increment (greater than 4.8 cm/yr). Onset of puberty was recorded at a chronologic age of 14.6 +/- 1.9 years in boys and 13.3 +/- 1.9 years in girls. Height at onset of puberty related to chronologic age was -2.4 +/- 1.3 SD. Height velocity during puberty was within normal limits in 62.5% of the children. No significant difference in pubertal growth was detected in patients who had received transplants before and after the onset of puberty. Duration of pubertal development was within normal limits. In girls, menarche was achieved at a mean chronologic age of 15.9 years and bone age 12.9 years. Adult height was attained at an average age of 20.3 years in boys and 18.7 years in girls. Overall, one third of the children attained an adult height greater than 2 SD below the mean. Our data indicate that although poor growth before kidney transplantation has a great influence on adult height, the loss of growth potential during pubertal development seems even more important.\r"

Several patterns of response were observed after treatment was stopped: the mean growth rate in 22 children decreased after treatment but remained above basal rates, the mean growth rate in seven children was similar to the rates during treatment, and the mean growth rate in 16 children was less than basal rates. Twenty children received therapy for an additional 6 months and had a mean increase in growth rate from 3.6 +/- 1.3 to 6.7 +/- 2.4 cm/yr. The decreased growth rate after discontinuation of treatment and increased rate with resumption of therapy indicates that maintenance of the increased growth rate might be dependent on continuation of hGH therapy.\r"

Before transplantation the three patients excreted excessive amounts of succinylacetoacetate (SAA), succinylacetone (SA), tyrosyl acidic compounds, and 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). The activity of 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALA-D) in red blood cells was markedly inhibited (1% to 5% of control) in the three patients. Successful liver transplantation resulted in decreased excretion of urinary SAA plus SA, tyrosyl acidic compounds, and ALA. Two of the patients continued to excrete significant amounts of SAA plus SA, whereas those compounds were undetectable in the urine of the third patient. Tyrosine loading resulted in increased excretion of SAA plus SA in two patients, but those compounds remained undetectable in the third. All three patients continued to excrete higher than normal amounts of ALA, but the activity of ALA-D in red blood cells returned to normal after transplantation, indicating marked clearance of SA from the blood. Liver transplantation may not totally correct the biochemical abnormalities of hereditary tyrosinemia. It is likely that the kidney is the source of persistent biochemical aberrations in the urine without significant effects on the blood. Our results suggest the existence of heterogeneity for renal involvement in hereditary tyrosinemia.\r"

  ".W": "Puberty is commonly associated with an increase in insulin requirement in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. To investigate whether this pubertal increase in insulin requirement is confined to diabetic subjects, we examined insulin responses during oral glucose tolerance testing with glucose loads per unit weight (1.75 g/kg) or unit surface area (55 g/m2), and insulin sensitivity via euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in prepubertal and pubertal children without diabetes. Irrespective of glucose dose, glucose tolerance testing elicited a threefold greater insulin response, but equivalent euglycemia, in pubertal versus prepubertal children (P less than 0.05). As assessed by the clamp procedure, prepubertal children were approximately 30% more sensitive than their pubertal counterparts (P less than 0.01). Insulin sensitivity correlated inversely with body mass index (r = -0.49, P less than 0.02), serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate concentration (r = -0.57, P less than 0.01), and log somatomedin C/insulinlike growth factor I (r = -0.45, P less than 0.05). We conclude that puberty is associated with decreased sensitivity to insulin that normally is compensated for by increased insulin secretion. Thus, in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, an approximately 30% increase in insulin dosage should be anticipated with the onset of puberty.\r"

In the other 4 groups (62 patients) in whom skin sclerosis was more diffuse, ACA was found in one case. Fluorescent antinuclear antibodies (FANA) with a diffusely grainy pattern, those with a nucleolar pattern and the anti-Scl-70 antibody were present in all 6 groups, but were significantly more frequent in the last 4 groups than in Groups 1 and 2. The cumulative survival rate as well as disease duration were found to be significantly longer in the first 2 groups designated \"limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis,\" than in the 5th and 6th groups, i.e., patients in whom the trunk also was involved: \"diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis.\" The cumulative survival rate and disease duration of patients with skin sclerosis of the face and limbs, but not of trunk, were not significantly different either from those of patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis or from those of patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Thus these patients show the same antibody pattern as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, but the prognosis not significantly different from the other 2 subsets. We suggest they constitute a distinct subset of systemic sclerosis for which we propose the name \"intermediate cutaneous systemic sclerosis.\"\r"

A spirometric study was performed at baseline, Week 12, and Week 48. In the active phase of the disease a correlation was found between VC and chest expansion, whereas neither of these variables was related to the thoracic pain and over-all disease activity. We also found that the VC correlated with the lumbar flexion index, but not with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or IgA. Although all clinical efficacy variables showed an improvement during treatment with both drugs, no change in VC was found, even in patients with the most restricted ventilatory impairment. We conclude that the VC is not an appropriate variable for the evaluation of short term therapy in AS.\r"

At 30 minutes postburn, the three burn groups demonstrated a significant decrease in cardiac index % (CI%). At 1 1/2 hours postburn, the RR group CI% was significantly greater than for the SR group and not significantly different from that of controls. At 2 hours postburn, fluid was abruptly decreased in the RR group and the salutary effect on CI promptly dissipated. In this model, the early decrement in CI following thermal injury is responsive to rapid resuscitation, concluding that the etiology of decreased CI following thermal trauma is at least partially due to inadequate volumes of fluid administration in the early postburn period.\r"

The age, race, postburn day grafted, anatomic site grafted, and nature of the recipient graft bed was recorded. The patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year, at which time the skin grafts were classified as Excellent (E)--skin graft flat and not thickened; Good (G)--less than 5% of skin graft thickened or elevated; Fair (F)--greater than 5% of skin graft thickened or elevated; and Poor (P)--skin graft elevated greater than 2 mm or contracture present. Overall, 55% of the grafted sites were excellent, 18% were good, 13% were fair, and 14% were poor. Pediatric patients had a higher incidence of fair or poor results (50%) than adults (17%) (p less than 0.001), and blacks had poorer (39% F or P) results than whites (12% F or P) (p less than 0.001). The presence of dermal elements in the recipient graft bed was associated with less long-term skin graft scarring than when the grafts were placed on recipient beds without dermal elements (p less than 0.01). Skin grafts that were performed within 14 days of the injury had a lower incidence of F or P results (24%), than grafts performed after 14 days postburn (37%) (p less than 0.03). Based on the results of this prospective study, it is possible to identify and quantitate the relative risk of a burned patient developing a hypertrophic skin graft.\r"

The mean burn size was 35 +/- 20% with a mean full-thickness burn of 28 +/- 20%. Mean patient age was 34 +/- 21 years. Overall survival was 82%. The mean time of wound coverage was 10.2 +/- 6.7 days. There was no significant difference in the number of dressing changes, area changed, purulence, autograft take, and final results between allograft- and Biobrane-covered sites. There were no complications following use of either Biobrane or allograft. We conclude that Biobrane is as effective as frozen human cadaver allograft for the temporary coverage of freshly excised full-thickness burn wounds before autografting.\r"

Nutritional support in both groups was similar. Of the 48 survivors there was no difference in their age, % TBSA burn, and per cent meeting caloric requirement. The early excision survivors had a greater percentage third-degree burn and weight change but a decreased length of stay. It was concluded that even though the formula, previously developed at our institution, may lead to a slight overestimation in determination of the caloric needs of early excision patients, it is an acceptable means of determining their requirements.\r"

  ".W": "The ideal suture for use within the urinary tract should maintain its tensile strength until wound repair is satisfactory and then it should undergo rapid total absorption without promoting stone formation. The bladder has a great potential for repair, attaining 100 per cent of the strength of the unwounded tissue in 14 to 21 days. Braided synthetic absorbable sutures appear to be suited ideally for closure of incised wounds of a urinary conduit. They maintain their tensile strength for approximately 21 days, during which time the healing tissues regain strength rapidly. Because sutures are foreign bodies and have access to urine, they may serve as a nidus for stone formation. Several factors that have been identified as important determinants of foreign body urolithiasis include the presence of urine, urine volume and pH, infection, physical and chemical configuration of the foreign body, and animal species. The incidence of suture urolithiasis is related directly to the duration in which the sutures are present in the urinary tract. Consequently, absorbable sutures are preferred over nonabsorbable sutures for closure of wounds of the urinary conduit. In the absence of infection braided synthetic absorbable sutures have distinct advantages over gut sutures for closure of urinary tract wounds. They are absorbed by nonenzymatic hydrolysis in a predictable manner with limited inflammatory response. In contrast, gut sutures have an unpredictable absorption rate by enzymatic degradation and elicit an exaggerated inflammatory response. Because infected urine, especially Proteus species, accelerates the degradation of absorbable synthetic sutures to a greater degree than gut sutures, wound closure in the presence of infection should be accomplished with the absorbable natural fiber suture. Nonabsorbable sutures or staples should not be used in the urinary tract because they predictably promote urolithiasis.\r"

Complications occurred in 13 patients (39.4 per cent): 8 required reoperation for a fistula, stricture or diverticulum, and 5 underwent internal urethrotomy or urethral dilation. Of the 8 patients 3 needed more than 1 revision. These revisions were short and generally uncomplicated. Final results uniformly were good functionally and cosmetically.

Nicotine was measured by gas/liquid chromatography. PGI2 was measured by radioimmunoassay of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and its biologic activity was assessed by inhibition of platelet aggregation. Nicotine is concentrated in the heart and blood vessel wall and causes a statistically significant reduction in PGI2 production. Carbon monoxide raised PGI2 production significantly in all chambers, and the combination of nicotine and carbon monoxide further raised PGI2 production. The difference between the effects of nitrogen and carbon monoxide alone and nitrogen and a combination of nitrogen and carbon monoxide was significant in all chambers. It is hypothesized that nicotine exerts a direct metabolic effect in lowering PGI2 production. Carbon monoxide may make the endothelial cell relatively hypoxic, a powerful stimulus of PGI2 production, or less likely exert a direct toxic effect on the endothelial cell.\r"

Type IV EDs, the arterial-ecchymotic type, is of concern to vascular surgeons because it is frequently associated with spontaneous catastrophic bleeding. This article summarizes our experience with five members of a family and reviews the 31 patients with type IV EDs described in the literature. The 22 male and 14 female patients had a mean age of 26 years. The 36 patients included 23 with easy \"bruisability,\" 22 with hypermobility of their joints (especially the fingers), 13 with transparent skin, and 11 with excessive elasticity of the skin. The patients had 41 episodes of hemorrhage and 29 vascular surgical procedures. Twenty-nine of the patients had an aneurysm or a dissection, whereas eight patients had arteriovenous fistulas. Arteriography was associated with a complication rate of 67%. The prognosis for a patient with type IV EDs is poor; 44% die before surgery and 19% die during the operative period. Bleeding should be managed nonoperatively when possible. Fifty-one percent die before reaching 40 years of age. Arteriography should be avoided. The standard repair of aneurysms and perforations is unlikely to be successful because of marked vessel friability. Bleeding vessels should be repaired with buttressed sutures and no tension or should be ligated. Genetic counseling with assay of collagen production is recommended for family members.\r"

  ".W": "The use of the saphenous vein in situ is associated with unique problems that decrease primary graft patency (patency uninterrupted by revision). During the past 5 years, we have performed 192 in situ saphenous vein bypasses in 182 patients, including 61 to the popliteal artery, 128 to infrapopliteal arteries, and three to isolated popliteal artery segments. The operative indications were critical limb ischemia in 178 cases (93%), popliteal aneurysm in eight cases (4%), and disabling claudication in six cases (3%). A progressive decline in primary patency occurred after operation. The primary patency rate at 36 months was only 48% for femoropopliteal bypasses and was 58% for femorotibial bypasses. In contrast, the secondary patency rate (patency maintained by thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or revision) at 36 months was 89% and 80% for femoropopliteal and femorotibial bypasses, respectively. The improved secondary patency was due to postoperative surveillance of graft hemodynamics and the success of graft revision. Problems unique to the in situ technique (incomplete valve incision, residual arteriovenous fistula, graft torsion and entrapment) accounted for 58% of early (less than 30 days) graft revisions and 52% of late revisions. The use of Doppler spectral analysis at operation and duplex scanning after operation can locate unsuspected technical errors and identify grafts with low flow at increased risk for failure. The primary patency of the in situ bypass mandates objective assessment of valve incision sites at operation and a protocol of postoperative surveillance to identify grafts that require revision. Early surgical intervention of hemodynamically abnormal but patent in situ bypasses is rewarded by excellent secondary patency.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent carotid stenosis occurs randomly in approximately 10% of patients undergoing endarterectomy. Previous studies have described several histologic features but have failed to clearly elucidate the pathogenesis of this disorder. To improve our understanding of this disease, we reviewed pathologic lesions from 20 patients with recurrent stenosis. All specimens had been fixed in formalin and were embedded in paraffin and had undergone routine microscopic studies. In addition, immunoperoxidase staining with anti-factor VIII for endothelial cells and anti-desmin and anti-actin for smooth muscle cells was performed. Recurrent stenosis had developed in 16 of the 20 specimens within 2 years of endarterectomy (early), whereas the remaining four cases occurred from 2 to 7 years after the original carotid endarterectomy (late). Endothelial cells were found lining the luminal surface of both early and late recurrent lesions. Six of sixteen early and three of four late specimens had areas of luminal surface covered with cells exhibiting immunoreactivity for anti-factor VIII. Cells showing immunoreactivity for actin or desmin and demonstrating the morphology of smooth muscle cells were found in 9 of 16 early restenotic lesions but in no late ones. Areas of endothelial cell lining of the recurrent carotid lesions in a substantial number of patients in this study represent a finding not previously described. The presence of these cells implies that a phase of the arterial healing after endarterectomy involves re-endothelialization. Contrary to previous reports, no significant role of thrombosis and/or intraplaque hemorrhage could be found to contribute to development of recurrent stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Renin-angiotensin system blockade with the converting enzyme inhibitor, MK422, resulted in restoration of baseline renal blood flow and glomerular filtration 30 minutes after cross-clamp release. Left atrial to left femoral bypass resulted in significant reduction in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration 30 minutes after cross-clamp release. Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the altered renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration rates after thoracic aortic occlusion.\r"

This virus, estimated to kill up to a half of those infected, has spread to more than 1 million Americans. There is no safe and effective treatment. Nor is there a vaccine. From our understanding of HIV transmission, further spread of the virus can be stopped by the use of various techniques. The combined use of education-motivation-skill building, serologic screening, and contact tracing/notification could eliminate or substantially reduce transmission. To accomplish this reduction an immense concerted effort by physicians, public health practitioners, business, and community organizations is required to get across the simple prevention messages. Those messages are: Any sexual intercourse (outside of mutually monogamous or HIV antibody-negative relationships) must be protected with a condom. Do not share unsterile needles or syringes. All women who may have been exposed should seek HIV-antibody testing before becoming pregnant and, if positive, avoid pregnancy. Only through a concerted, vigorous, and sustained prevention program that deals frankly with this problem will those individuals at risk be reached and motivated to take personal responsibility to protect themselves. Without such an effort, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome will continue to kill ever-increasing numbers of Americans.\r"

In groups 1 and 2 patients resumed drug therapy if pressure rose to hypertensive levels. Loss of at least 4.5 kg (10 + lb) was maintained by 30% of group 1, with a group mean loss of 1.8 kg (4 lb); sodium intake fell 36% and modest alcohol intake reduction was reported. At four years, 39% in group 1 remained normotensive without drug therapy, compared with 5% in group 2. Study findings demonstrated that nutritional therapy may substitute for drugs in a sizable proportion of hypertensives or, if drugs are still needed, can lessen some unwanted biochemical effects of drug treatment.\r"

This inquiry has led us to regard Alzheimer's disease as a multifactorial disorder in which a putative infective agent is an essential element. Despite seeming competition among current hypotheses, there is overall unity. The concept that Down's syndrome is a congenital form of Alzheimer's disease and that both conditions are the result of a ubiquitous infective pathogen that affects genetically susceptible individuals offers the broadest unification. In both conditions slow infection develops against the background of aging. Indirect evidence involving immunologic and other biologic phenomena supports the postulated infectious origin. Overlapping pathologic and clinical features of Alzheimer's disease and the known transmissible encephalopathies suggest a similar pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized controlled clinical trial, the effectiveness of emergency medical technician (EMT) use of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) was compared with EMT use of standard defibrillators for patients in cardiac arrest. A total of 321 cardiac arrest patients were treated during the study: 116 were treated by EMTs using the AED (AUTO group), 158 were treated by EMTs using the standard defibrillators (standard group), and 47 were treated by EMTs using the standard defibrillator when they were assigned to use the AED. There was no significant differences in hospital admission or discharge rates between the AUTO group (54% admitted, 28% discharged) and the standard group (52% admitted, 23% discharged) for patients in ventricular fibrillation (VF), for patients in non-VF rhythms, or for all patients combined. The only significant difference observed was in the time from power ON to first shock: 1.1 minutes average AUTO group and 2.0 minutes average standard group. The treatment groups did not differ significantly in sensitivity for VF (78% AED, 76% standard), specificity for non-VF rhythms (100% AED, 95% standard), or rates of defibrillation to a non-VF rhythm (62% AED, 57% standard). We conclude that in clinical outcomes and device performance, AEDs are comparable with standard defibrillators and should be considered an acceptable alternative. Automatic external defibrillators appear to have advantages over standard defibrillators in training, skill retention, and faster operation. Such devices can make early defibrillation available for a much larger portion of the population. They are a major innovation for the prehospital care of cardiac arrest patients.\r"

During the 12 months following implementation of the PPS, Wisconsin's institutionalized elderly Medicaid population experienced a 72% increase in the rate of hospitalization and a 26% decline in hospital length of stay. Two explanations for the increased hospitalization include physician manipulation of the PPS and increased rehospitalization of nursing home residents who may have been discharged prematurely from hospitals. Between 1982 and 1985, analysis of mortality data revealed a 26.2% increase in the rate of deaths occurring in nursing homes. The increase in nursing home deaths began in 1983 and was associated with a 10.3% decline in hospital deaths during the same period. Using a series of logistic analyses, the shift in location of death from hospitals to nursing homes was found to be more pronounced after implementation of the PPS. This change in location of death may reflect both a less aggressive use of hospital resources by physicians caring for terminally ill patients and a transfer of seriously ill patients to nursing homes for terminal care.\r"

Although the interaction is only partially understood at present, several conclusions are evident. Burn patients exhibit alterations in triglyceride, cholesterol, carnitine, fatty acid, lipoprotein and prostaglandin metabolism. Glucose appears to be more effective than fat as an energy source in the nutritional support of seriously burned patients. Conservative administration of fat, particularly linoleic acid, is recommended in view of its immunosuppressive and hyperlipidemic tendencies. Dietary enrichment with eicosapentaenoic acid may likewise prove to be of merit in the diet therapy of burns.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of infiltrating monocytes-macrophages and T-lymphocytes in 45 primary colorectal tumors and 8 metastatic lymph nodes has been investigated by immunoperoxidase labeling with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The number of lymphoreticular cells observed in tumor tissue, staged according to Dukes classification, was compared with paired normal tissue and between staged groups by statistical analysis. T-lymphocytes were not significantly elevated above the normal in either Dukes B or C stage tumors, although the IL-2 receptor (MoAb Tac) was expressed by varying numbers of T-cells in both groups. Mononuclear phagocytes increased numerically in both Dukes B (1.5-fold, P-value less than .01) and Dukes C tumors (2.5-fold, P-value less than .001) as compared to those in the uninvolved gut. In addition, the number of both total (MoAbs 3.9, 24) and stimulated mononuclear phagocytes expressing the C3b receptor (MoAb E11) was greater in metastasizing than in nonmetastasizing tumors (P-value less than .01). Thus the T-cell-to-monocyte ratio was altered from 2:1 in normal tissue to 1:1 in advanced tumors. The stromal environment around tumor cells in lymph nodes was similar to that of the primary tumor, but there was a reduction in the proportion of cells expressing the C3b receptor; unlike the primary tumor, there was virtually no infiltration of the tumor epithelium. Although there is a significant alteration in the mononuclear phagocyte population within colorectal tumors, there is no histologic evidence for a cytotoxic role for these cells.\r"

At small tumor burdens (less than 1% of the host weight), weight loss was observed without a reduction in food intake. As the tumor mass increased, weight loss also increased and reached 33% of host body weight in females and 20% in males when compared with the weight of age-matched controls. The reduction in host body weight was directly proportional to the tumor size and was reversible when the tumor was excised. There was a preferential loss of body fat in tumor-bearing animals with an increase in the plasma level of free fatty acids, although there was a minimal elevation of ketone bodies. Tumor growth was accompanied by progressive hypoglycemia and a reduction in the plasma insulin levels. The decrease in plasma insulin may have contributed to the catabolic effects of progressive tumor growth.\r"

The effects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on calcium transporting cells in the intestine are marked and well defined. The tissue (intestinal tissue) is easily isolated and manipulated and hence, this is an ideal tissue in which to examine the mechanism of divalent cation transport. The mechanism by which 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 brings about this effect should help in understanding sterol hormone action.\r"

Uranyl acetate (UA, 0.8 mg/kg) produced ARF in some animals but did not in others. Rabbits recovering from UA-induced ARF were highly resistant to a rechallenge with a larger dose of the agent (2 mg/kg). Their glomeruli did not respond to AII, AVP and NE in vitro. In animals having not experienced ARF following the initial insult, however, resistance to the rechallenge was lower than in animals recovering from ARF, and the glomerular response to contractile stimuli was well sustained. A two hour clamping of the renal artery induced ARF in uninephrectomized rabbits. These animals were not resistant to an additional ischemia in the recovery phase, despite inhibited glomerular contractile responses to AII. These data indicate a nonspecific inhibition of glomerular responses to contractile stimuli in the recovery phase of ARF. It is unlikely, however, that resistance to ARF can be attributed to the loss of the glomerular contractile response.\r"

  ".W": "The binding characteristics of cationic and more neutral immune complexes with heparan sulfate-proteoglycan enriched anionic sites of glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix were studied. Rat kidneys were treated either with buffers alone or buffers containing heparitinase or chondroitinase-ABC followed by perfusion with cationic or native immune complexes. Tissues were processed for immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy after fixation with glutaraldehyde or tannic acid glutaraldehyde. Kidneys perfused with radioiodinated immune complexes were processed for light and electron microscopic autoradiography. In addition, glomeruli from kidneys perfused with radioiodinated immune complexes were isolated and counted for radioactivity. By immunofluorescence the cationic immune complexes deposited linearly along the glomerular basement membrane. By electron microscopy, the cationic complexes localized mainly in the inner and outer layers of the glomerular basement membrane and to a certain extent in the mesangial matrix in a distribution that corresponded to previously documented anionic sites. Whereas heparitinase treatment abrogated the binding of cationic immune complexes in both glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix, chondroitinase-ABC treatment did not cause any decrease in binding. In contrast, more neutral immune complexes appeared to be nonspecifically trapped in the mesangium, and their distribution was unaffected by both enzymatic treatments. Light and electron microscopic autoradiography and counts of isolated glomeruli confirmed these findings. The results overall indicate that cationic immune complexes bind electrostatically to the heparan sulfate-proteoglycan enriched anionic sites of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix, while more neutral immune complexes are nonspecifically trapped in the mesangium of the renal glomerulus.\r"

Even when shown to be present, the ligand specificity of the receptor has not been determined. Decapsulated rat glomeruli obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 50 to 100 g were placed in enriched culture media. On days four to eight, cells of epithelial morphology were observed growing out of glomeruli. Receptors for C3 were detected by rosette formation of sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with antibody (A) and complement (EAC) around the glomerular epithelial cells in culture. The EACs were prepared by incubating antibody-coated sheep erythrocytes with C5-deficient mouse serum or with individual components of complement. Results indicate the presence of two types of C3 receptors on glomerular epithelial cells--CR1 for C3b and CR2 for C3d. The functional roles of these receptors remain to be elucidated.\r"

Plasma aldosterone (PA) and insulin (IRI) responses to acute KCl infusion were examined in control and remnant kidney dogs on two potassium intakes. Dogs (N = 8) received the KCl infusions after 10 days of a 60, and then 10 days of a 200, mEq daily potassium intake during control and after surgical-induced renal failure (CRF). A one hour intravenous infusion of KCl (2 mEq KCl/kg/hr) in dextrose and water was performed with blood samples for PA, IRI, creatinine and electrolytes, and urine for electrolytes and creatinine at 20 minute intervals one hour preceding, during, and after the infusion. Preinfusion PA was higher (P less than 0.05) in controls and CRF dogs on 200 mEq potassium intake compared to 60 mEq potassium intake. The peak incremental responses of PA to KCl infusion were increased (P less than 0.01) in CRF compared to controls on 60 mEq (PA 36 +/- 4.2 vs. 26 +/- 3.0 ng/dl) and 200 mEq (delta PA 49 +/- 5.6 vs. 37 +/- 2.8 ng/dl) potassium intakes. Differences in incremental PA responses in CRF were not due to altered aldosterone metabolic clearance rates, changes in renin, or ACTH activity. Pre-infusion IRI was higher (P less than 0.05) in CRF than control dogs on both potassium diets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prominent staining with both antibodies was seen in the mesangial areas of all normal kidney sections investigated. Occasional staining of arteriolar walls of the same tissues, however, was also observed. In contrast, no mesangial staining was seen using monoclonal antibodies reactive against other 'early' complement components, such as C1q and C3. Specificity of the glomerular staining with the anti-C4 reagents was demonstrated in two patients possessing only the C4A serum component but lacking genetically the C4B locus products. As would be predicted, glomerular staining with the anti-C4A reagent, but not anti-C4B, was clearly demonstrable. It is concluded that both isotypes of complement C4 are present in normal human glomeruli and thus might be operative for normal mesangial function.\r"

Toxicity from BCG treatment was insignificant, but the addition of DDP increased both early nausea and vomiting and later hematologic toxicity. There were three long-term complete remission patients, and these all came from the group of six patients with pretreatment residual disease less than 2 cm. A univariate analysis of pretreatment prognostic factors indicated significantly better prognosis (P less than 0.02) for patients with no palpable tumor, platelet count less than 400,000/mm3, residual tumor less than 2 cm, resting pulse less than 91/min. and LDH less than 250 U/L.

We studied the ability of a new tissue adhesive (N-butyl-cyanoacrylate monomer) to enforce the bronchial suture line. The left main bronchus in each of five pigs in Group A was completely transected and closed by four stitches and tissue adhesive. The transected left main bronchus in each of the other five pigs in Group B was connected with 11 to 14 interrupted polyglycolic acid 3-0 sutures. The time required for reconstruction was 10 +/- 3.6 minutes in Group A and 25.0 +/- 6.5 minutes in Group B. No symptoms of a constricted airway were apparent in Group A. All pigs were examined at an interval of from 5 to 8 weeks after operation. Evidence of infection at the bronchus appeared in three animals: two in Group A and one in Group B. One instance of air leakage at the anastomosis occurred in Group B. We measured the maximum tensile strength of the bronchial suture line by means of an electromechanical testing machine comparing the tensile strength of the treated left bronchus with that of the control right bronchus. The maximum tension of the treated bronchus in Group A was 10.3 +/- 1.52 (pounds) and that of control was 8.0 +/- 1.56 (pounds) (p less than 0.05). The maximum tension of Group B was 7.93 +/- 0.29 (pounds) on the treated side and 6.78 +/- 0.32 (pounds) on the control side (p less than 0.05). The suture line with tissue adhesive was enforced sufficiently to act as a stable connective tissue. Histologic studies in Group A revealed that the suture line was completely healed without tissue damage and was strengthened by the tissue adhesive.\r"

Although the neural mechanisms of nociceptors and the stimuli that activate them are much better understood, it must be emphasized that the perception of pain, as well as the meaning of pain to the individual, is a complex behavioral phenomenon and involves psychologic and emotional processes in addition to activation of nociceptive pathways. Pain related to malignant disease can be classified as somatic, visceral, and deafferentation in type. Somatic pain and visceral pain involve direct activation of nociceptors and are often a complication of tumor infiltration of tissues or injury of tissues as a consequence of cancer therapy. The management of this type of pain is typically accomplished by treating the tumor (with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) and by using the appropriate non-narcotic, narcotic, and adjuvant analgesic agents. Neuroablative therapies may be helpful in specific circumstances. For example, cordotomy may be helpful for unilateral pain below the waist in patients with somatic and visceral pain. This procedure may also be helpful for early deafferentiation pain (i.e., lumbosacral plexopathy) in which peripheral nerves are compressed but not infiltrated or destroyed by metastatic tumor growth. Deafferentiation pain may be a complication of tumor infiltration of peripheral nerve or of cancer therapy that injures neural tissue. This type of pain is often poorly tolerated and difficult to control, particularly if not treated early and aggressively. Although incompletely understood, the pathophysiology of deafferentation pain appears to be different from that of somatic or visceral pain, and the treatment approaches may be different. Management approaches to deafferentation pain usually emphasize treatment of the pain, because injury to the nervous system may be difficult to reverse, even if one can successfully treat the underlying malignancy, and many deafferentation pain syndromes occur as a complication of cancer therapy. The role of narcotic analgesics in the management of deafferentation pain is not clear, although the published experience suggests that they are less useful than in somatic or visceral pain.\r"

However, cross-tolerance to orally and parenterally administered narcotics and the rapid development of tolerance to spinal narcotics have limited their usefulness. Opioids have extensive distribution in the CSF and plasma when administered into the epidural or intrathecal space, and delivery of drug to brain stem sites may account for many of the toxic and therapeutic effects of spinal opioids. Further clinical and pharmacokinetic studies are required to provide the information regarding: the optimal opioids for use as spinal analgesics; equieffective dose ratios of spinal opioids in comparison to parenteral or oral opioids; strategies useful to forestall the development of tolerance of spinally administered opioids; the analgesic efficacy of this therapy in opioid-tolerant patients; and the role of spinally administered nonopioid analgesics in the management of cancer pain in the tolerant patient. These questions will need resolution before this therapy can be recommended for routine use in the management of cancer pain.\r"

Daily supplementation with 20 mg/kg vitamin E intramuscularly during the first 3 days of life was associated with a rise in plasma vitamin E concentration and a reduction in hydrogen peroxide haemolysis of red blood cells in vitro. Among babies without haemorrhage on entry to the trial (n = 210), supplemented babies had a lower frequency of intraventricular haemorrhage than controls (8.8% v 34.3%; p less than 0.005) and a lower combined frequency of intraventricular and parenchymal haemorrhage (10.8% v 40.7%; p less than 0.0001) on the final ultrasound brain scan. This protective effect was observed in both inborn and referred babies but was stronger in the former. Supplementation had no effect on mortality, but among survivors fewer supplemented babies than controls had intraventricular or parenchymal haemorrhage (10.7% v 32.6%; p less than 0.001). Possibly, vitamin E scavenges free radicals generated during ischaemic injury of the subependymal region and thereby limits tissue damage and the extent of periventricular haemorrhage on reperfusion.\r"

Logistic regression procedures were used to control for confounding factors. Increasing donor age (odds ratio 3.7 per decade; p = 0.02) and donor seronegativity for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; odds ratio 10.1; p = 0.005) were associated with a high incidence of GVHD. Total rather than selective gastrointestinal decontamination (odds ratio 0.1; p = 0.004), donor seronegativity for herpes simplex virus (HSV; odds ratio 0.1; p = 0.003), and recipient EBV-seronegativity (odds ratio 0.05; p = 0.002) were associated with a low incidence of GVHD.

Graft survival was better in the cyclosporin group at 3 months and 1 year (93% and 80%) than in the conventional group (83% and 70%). This was not a significant difference.

Graft survival was significantly better (p less than 0.03) than in the 65 patients who received conventional therapy, in whom actuarial patient survival was 94%, and actuarial graft survival was 59% and 47% at 1 and 4 years. Renal function and other side-effects improved quickly after conversion with the better renal function maintained throughout follow-up. Renal biopsies at 90 days and 1 year in all patients did not show consistent improvement after conversion from cyclosporin in the histological features that might be attributable to cyclosporin toxicity. After conversion, 32% of the patients had acute rejection, generally within 30 days. 1 graft was lost to early acute rejection after conversion and another was lost 3 months later from acute-on-chronic rejection. A total of 8 grafts were lost to chronic rejection in the cyclosporin-treated group and 6 in the conventional group. The improvement in renal function obtained with this protocol of short-term cyclosporin with conversion to azathioprine and prednisolone has to be balanced against the risk of acute rejection and even loss of the graft after conversion.\r"

The optimum treatment of head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma has not yet been defined, but it appears that the ideal should consist of an aggressive multimodality approach. This includes surgical extirpation if it can be done without major morbidity, postoperative radiotherapy with a margin around known and suspected disease, and multiagent chemotherapy. Unlike most sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma (especially alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) spreads by way of the lymphatic system as well as the blood stream. Inclusion of the draining lymphatics in the radiation field must be given strong consideration.\r"

Six mature previously inactive horses were utilized for this study. During the 5-wk experiment, five of the horses were trained for 14 d on a treadmill ergometer at a constant treadmill speed of 5.6 km X hr-1 and a constant grade of 12.5% for graduated lengths of time. One horse was trained by lunging at a trotting pace in a round pen. Following training, plasma volume increased by 4.7 1 (29.1%, P less than 0.05). Although the rate of daily water intake did not change during the training period, 24-h urine output decreased by an average of 3.5 1 X d-1 (-24.5%, P less than 0.05). Resting glomerular filtration rate and the rate of sodium clearance were not altered by training. However, urea, potassium, and osmotic clearance were decreased by training (P less than 0.05) while free water clearance was increased (P less than 0.05). Resting plasma aldosterone and arginine vasopressin concentrations were not altered by training. Plasma potassium concentration was significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) following the 2 wk of training. These data would appear to suggest that renal control mechanisms affecting water reabsorption via the re-absorption of urea and osmotically active substances other than sodium provide the primary route for the training-induced hypervolemia seen in horses.\r"

Trials consisted of a cycling ride to exhaustion at 75% maximal oxygen uptake preceded by the ingestion of either 75 g of glucose in 350 ml of water (GLU), 75 g of fructose in 350 ml of water (FRU), or 350 ml of an artificially sweetened and flavored placebo (CON). No differences were observed between trials for oxygen uptake, respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate, or exercise time to exhaustion (CON = 92.7 +/- 5.2 min, FRU = 90.6 +/- 12.4, and GLU = 92.8 +/- 11.3, mean +/- SE). Blood glucose was elevated as a result of the GLU feeding, but fell rapidly with the onset of exercise, reaching a low of 4.02 +/- 0.34 mmol X l-1 at 15 min of exercise. Serum insulin also increased following the GLU feeding but had returned to pre-drink levels by 30 min of exercise. No differences in blood glucose and insulin were observed between FRU and CON. Muscle glycogen utilization during the first 30 min of exercise (CON = 46.3 +/- 8.2 mmol X kg-1 wet weight, FRU = 56.3 +/- 3.0 mmol X kg-1 wet weight, GLU = 50.0 +/- 4.9 mmol X kg-1 wet weight) and total glycogen use (CON = 93.4 +/- 11.1, FRU = 118.8 +/- 10.9, and GLU = 99.5 +/- 4.3) were similar in the three trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac myxoma is a true intracardiac neoplasm, which is histologically benign but which on occasion may exhibit behavior suggestive of a true malignancy. It is the most common form of primary cardiac tumor, accounting for 50% of such neoplasms. Seventy-five percent of myxomas are found in the left atrium, typically arising from a stalk attached to the area of the foramen ovale. Cardiac myxomas typically present as a triad of obstructive, embolic, and constitutional symptoms and thus mimic many more common systemic illnesses. This report summarizes 9 cases of cardiac myxoma seen at this institution since a previous report in 1972. Four cases with unusual manifestations are high-lighted in the text to illustrate the protean manifestations of this potentially curable illness. Non-invasive cardiac imaging is essential to establish the diagnosis and differentiate myxoma from the other more common illnesses it imitates. Echocardiography is highly accurate for its diagnosis, has proved invaluable for the management of these patients, and is the imaging technique of choice for initial evaluation of patients in whom the diagnosis of cardiac myxoma is suspected.\r"

  ".W": "The nevoid basal-cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by major manifestations, such as multiple basal-cell carcinomata, cysts of the jaws, and skeletal--specifically, rib--abnormalities. Findings in 53 patients and a review of the literature document both major and lesser-known manifestations of the disorder. The odontogenic keratocyst, which usually appears during adolescence, has a marked tendency to recur. In addition to the skin tumors, milia, epidermoid cysts, chalazia, comedones, and palmar and plantar pits are frequent. The skin tumors, originally thought to be independent of sun exposure, are more common in sun-exposed areas and are far less frequent and occur at a much later age in blacks than in whites. There is some evidence that radiation of the skin promotes the appearance of skin cancers in this disorder. Unilateral linear nevoid basal-cell carcinomas with comedones may represent postzygotic somatic mutation. A proclivity to other forms of neoplasia exists. Patients with this syndrome have had medulloblastoma, meningioma, ovarian fibroma, ovarian fibrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma of the jaws, cardiac fibroma, fetal rhabdomyoma, and lymphatic or chylous cysts of the mesentery. In addition to the usual modalities of treatment, topical immunotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil have been used with success. Oral synthetic retinoids, such as 13-cis-retinoic acid, have been used to prevent new lesions from appearing and to arrest the growth of older lesions by inducing differentiation. The independent observations of increased prostaglandin levels associated both with odontogenic keratocyst expansion and aggression of basal cell cancers merit further investigation both as a fundamental cellular mechanism and as a possible basis for treatment (e.g., with antiprostaglandins). The key to pre- and early postnatal diagnosis of the disorder--as well as to an understanding of the basic abnormality--lies in molecular genetics. Prime attention should be given to finding the site of the gene through the use of DNA and other markers.\r"

The Fab'-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was prepared by the maleimide method recently developed by Ishikawa et al. This method gave better recovery and less polymerization of HRP than the periodate method. By the direct immunoperoxidase method using this conjugate, myoglobin was shown to be localized in the I-band region of skeletal muscle cells. The outer membrane of mitochondria and triads stained intensely, but A-bands were not stained. Myonuclei and intermyofibrillar spaces were also not stained. The localization of myoglobin in the I-band implies its function in energy generation.\r"

Of these, 23 patients are alive at the average age of 27 years and live in the community, although they are dependent on assisted ventilation 24 hours a day. There were 8 patients who died at the average age of 30 years. Although normocapnic during the day, the presence of symptomatic nocturnal hypoventilation or pCO2 over 55 mmHg documented by continuous overnight capnograph study indicates the need for introducing overnight respiratory assistance. Mouth intermittent positive pressure ventilation alone or in combination with other techniques of ventilatory assistance can prolong life while allowing optimal function, attainment of higher levels of education, and home management of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "We randomly assigned 20 patients with progressively worsening generalized myasthenia gravis of recent onset whose illness was not controlled by anticholinesterase therapy to treatment with either cyclosporine (6 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) or placebo. Patients who had been treated with thymectomy, steroids, or other immunosuppressive agents were excluded. The duration of treatment was 12 months. Disease activity was assessed by quantified strength testing and by measurements of antihuman acetylcholine-receptor antibody. Patients were assessed at 6 months and 12 months, or at the following early end points: drug failure (doubling of creatinine), treatment failure (respiratory or swallowing difficulty), or protocol violation (stopping medication for more than five days). At six months, patients in the cyclosporine group had had significantly more objective improvement in strength; one early end point had been reached (drug failure; no treatment failures). In the placebo group, three early end points had been reached (all treatment failures). The decline in titers of acetylcholine-receptor antibody was larger in the treated group, although the difference was not statistically significant. At the end of the study (after 12 months of treatment or arrival at an earlier end point), improvement in strength and reduction in titers of anti-receptor antibody continued to be greater in the cyclosporine group. Nephrotoxicity occurred in three patients receiving cyclosporine but was nonprogressive with a reduction in dosage and reversible with discontinuation of the drug. These results are preliminary and need confirmation, but we conclude that cyclosporine is probably an effective therapy in some patients with myasthenia gravis.\r"

According to the Federal Trade Commission, total cigarette advertising and promotional expenditures reached $2.1 billion in 1984. From 1974 through 1984, total expenditures increased approximately sevenfold, or threefold after adjustment according to the consumer price index. In 1985, cigarette advertising expenditures accounted for 22.3 percent, 7.1 percent, and 0.8 percent of total advertising expenditures in outdoor media, magazines, and newspapers, respectively. When all products and services were ranked according to national advertising expenditures, cigarettes were first in the outdoor media, second in magazines, and third in newspapers. The proportion of total cigarette advertising and promotional expenditures devoted to promotional activities has increased steadily, from 25.5 percent in 1975 to 47.6 percent in 1984. The proportion of expenditures for cigarettes yielding 15 mg or less of \"tar\" has increased substantially and has consistently exceeded the domestic market share of these cigarettes. The fastest growing markets are discounted cigarettes and brands containing 25 cigarettes per pack. Several advertising campaigns have targeted women, minorities, and blue-collar workers. The study of these marketing trends should assist health officials in identifying and predicting patterns of cigarette use and in developing health promotion programs that counteract the influence of advertising by incorporating similar, effective techniques.\r"

  ".W": "A small set of distinctive short RNA molecules are found in the nuclei of all higher eukaryotic cells and yeast, in protein complexes known as 'small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles', or snRNPs. Recent work has confirmed early suggestions that these particles form part of the machinery by which primary RNA transcripts are processed to their mature, functional form. In particular, snRNPs have been shown to be an integral part of the 'spliceosome', a multi-component complex involved in the removal of intron sequences from the coding regions of messenger RNA precursors.\r"

  ".W": "The use of synonymous codons is strongly biased in the bacterium Escherichia coli and yeast, comprising both bias between codons recognized by the same transfer RNA and bias between groups of codons recognized by different synonymous tRNAs. A major determinant of the second sort of bias is tRNA content, codons recognized by abundant tRNAs being used more often than those recognised by rare tRNAs, particularly in highly expressed genes, probably owing to selection at the level of translation against codons recognized by rare tRNAs. Conversely, codon usage is likely to exert selection pressure on tRNA abundance. Here I develop a model for the coevolution of codon usage and tRNA abundance which explains why there are unequal abundances of synonymous tRNAs leading to biased usage between groups of codons recognized by them in unicellular organisms.\r"

  ".U": "87144572\r", 
  ".W": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a widespread functional disturbance of the human brain. Fibrillar amyloid proteins are deposited inside neurons as neurofibrillary tangles and extracellularly as amyloid plaque cores and in blood vessels. The major protein subunit (A4) of the amyloid fibril of tangles, plaques and blood vessel deposits is an insoluble, highly aggregating small polypeptide of relative molecular mass 4,500. The same polypeptide is also deposited in the brains of aged individuals with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). We have argued previously that the A4 protein is of neuronal origin and is the cleavage product of a larger precursor protein. To identify this precursor, we have now isolated and sequenced an apparently full-length complementary DNA clone coding for the A4 polypeptide. The predicted precursor consists of 695 residues and contains features characteristic of glycosylated cell-surface receptors. This sequence, together with the localization of its gene on chromosome 21, suggests that the cerebral amyloid deposited in Alzheimer's disease and aged Down's syndrome is caused by aberrant catabolism of a cell-surface receptor.\r"

Although the mode of transmission is uncertain, family, twin and adoption studies strongly suggest a genetic involvement. Because a basic biochemical abnormality is not known, direct analysis of the disease using a probe for the defective gene is not possible. However, a specific locus can be tested for its relevance to the aetiology of AD by genetic linkage, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Using probes for the c-Ha-ras-1 oncogene and the insulin gene, Gerhard et al. and Egeland et al. found convincing evidence for close linkage between these markers and a locus for AD in a large Old Order Amish pedigree. In an attempt to confirm this finding, we examined three bipolar pedigrees outside the Amish population. Our results indicate the absence of linkage from 0 to 15% recombination frequency between AD and the insulin gene-HRAS1 region in these pedigrees.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of transcription initiation by proteins binding at DNA sequences some distance from the promoter region itself seems to be a general phenomenon in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Proteins bound to an enhancer site in eukaryotes can turn on a distant gene, whereas efficient repression of some prokaryotic genes such as the gal, ara and deo operons of Escherichia coli, requires the presence of two operator sites, separated by 110, 200 and 600 base pairs (bp) respectively. In the deo operon, which encodes nucleoside catabolizing enzymes, we have shown that efficient and cooperative repression can be obtained when the distance between the two sites ranges from 224 to 997 bp. Here, we report that transcription initiation can be regulated from an operator site placed 1 to 5 kilobases (kb) downstream of the deoP2 promoter (and downstream of the transcribed gene), and present the first experimental data for prokaryotic regulation at distances greater than 1 kb. Our results support the model of DNA loop formation as a common regulatory mechanism explaining both some prokaryotic regulation and the action of eukaryotic enhancers.\r"

  ".W": "A number of intracellular, membrane-bound compartments in both the endocytic and exocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells have an acidic internal pH. In endocrine cells, the mature secretory vesicle has an acidic pH; secretory vesicles isolated from exocrine cells, however, appear to have a neutral pH. Recently we have used a newly developed immunocytochemical technique to map low-pH compartments in insulin-secreting islet cells with the electron microscope and find that during the maturation of the secretory vesicle there is a progressive acidification of these vesicles that begins as soon as the trans Golgi condensing vacuoles form. Now we have used this technique to examine two exocrine cells: the pancreatic acinar cell and the parotid serous cell. In both cell types, the trans Golgi condensing vacuoles are acidic and accumulate the low-pH probe to the same extent as condensing vacuoles of insulin-secreting islet cells. Unlike insulin-secreting cells, however, maturation of the granules is accompanied by a return of luminal pH to near neutrality. Therefore, although the pH of storage granules in exocrine and endocrine cells is different, the pH of the condensing vacuoles in both cells is acidic.\r"

The underlying cause of these haematological abnormalities is poorly understood. We report here that bone marrow progenitors isolated from AIDS or ARC patients are responsive to recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) and recombinant erythropoietin. Antibodies present in the serum of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), however, could suppress the growth of these progenitors, but not the growth of progenitors from HIV seronegative controls. A component of this immune-mediated suppression appears to be antibodies directed towards the envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of HIV.\r"

  ".U": "87144665\r", 
  ".W": "The protein-mediated exchange of strands between a DNA double helix and a homologous DNA single strand involves both synapsis and branch migration, which are two important aspects of any general recombination reaction. Purified DNA-dependent ATPases from Escherichia coli (recA protein), Ustilago (rec 1 protein) and phage T4 (uvsX protein) have been shown to drive both synapsis and branch migration in vitro. The T4 gene 32 protein is a helix-destabilizing protein that greatly stimulates uvsX-protein-catalysed synapsis, and the E. coli SSB (single-strand binding) protein stimulates the analogous recA-protein-mediated reaction to a lesser degree. One suspects that several other proteins also play a role in the strand exchange process. For example, a DNA helicase could in principle accelerate branch migration rates by helping to melt the helix at the branch point. The T4 dda protein is a DNA helicase that is required to move the T4 replication fork past DNA template-bound proteins in vitro. Previously, we have shown that the dda protein binds to a column that contains immobilized T4 uvsX protein. We show here that this helicase specifically stimulates the branch migration reaction that the uvsX protein catalyses as a central part of the genetic recombination process in a T4 bacteriophage-infected cell.\r"

Mean biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight were all significantly smaller with premature rupture of the membranes than without. However, this reflected younger gestational age and diminished fetal growth, rather than physical compression. The reduction in abdominal circumference was greater than that in other indices, which further suggests compromised intrauterine growth. Clinical interpretation of ultrasound measurements should consider the increased likelihood of growth retardation with preterm premature rupture of the membranes to avoid underestimating gestational age and/or missing the diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation.\r"

The intrapair differences in BPD, abdominal circumference, femur length, and estimated fetal weight were evaluated as predictors of discordant fetal growth. Although the intrapair difference in BPD measurement was not a statistically significant predictor, an intrapair difference in abdominal circumference of 20 mm or more was found to have sensitivity 80%, specificity 85%, positive predictive value 62%, and negative predictive value 93%. Intrapair difference in the estimated fetal weight was found to be the best predictor of discordant fetal growth (sensitivity 80%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 80%, and negative predictive value 93%). These data suggest that the intrapair difference in abdominal circumference measurement could be effectively used as a screening test for the diagnosis of discordant fetal growth. If the intrapair difference in abdominal circumference is 20 mm or greater, further evaluation, by determining the intrapair difference in estimated fetal weight, is indicated.\r"

We determined the gestational age at the time of initial auscultation of fetal heart tones with an ordinary fetoscope, and its relationship to quickening, parity, and placenta location. Fetal heart tones were first identified by auscultation at a mean gestational age of 19.4 weeks (range 17-22 weeks). Detection was possible in 81% of patients examined at 20 weeks and in virtually all patients examined at 21 weeks or later. Once heard, fetal heart tones were identified in every subsequent visit for all patients. Parity and placenta location were significant factors influencing initial fetal heart tone detection. Auscultation preceded quickening in only 12% of patients. Recommendations for using initial fetal heart tone detection in clinical practice are given.\r"

The effectiveness of each ultrasound variable in the antenatal recognition of the SGA fetus was assessed. An abnormal abdominal circumference was the best predictor, confirming SGA in 98% of cases. Other variables (biparietal diameter, femur length, femur length/abdominal circumference ratio, ponderal index, or estimated fetal weight) were less accurate for predicting SGA. When we determined expected results based on a 10% prevalence of SGA, negative predictive value was greater than 92% for all variables studied; however, with the exception of estimated fetal weight and femur length, positive predictive values were disappointing, including abdominal circumference (21%). This report establishes the limits of ultrasound-derived growth variables in the antenatal identification of the SGA fetus.\r"

Thirty-five healthy women with normal twin pregnancies were examined every three weeks from the 15th week of gestation to delivery. Among the measurements obtained were the biparietal diameter (BPD), the abdominal circumference, and the calculated fetal weight. From 15-28 weeks, the growth velocity of the BPD and abdominal circumference remained fairly constant, with a steady increase in incremental growth. Beyond this age, we observed a slowing in growth of the BPD, while the abdominal circumference continued at a constant rate. The growth velocity of the weight steadily increased throughout pregnancy. Although greater biologic variability in weight between twin A and B was observed as gestational age progressed, the overall mean weights of twin A and B were not statistically different. We have generated a nomogram of fetal weight gain throughout pregnancy.\r"

The key to an accurate antenatal diagnosis is careful scanning of the fetus and knowledge of the abnormalities that may be associated with a particular anomaly. In the presence of fetal anomalies known to be associated with increased frequency of chromosome abnormalities, fetal karyotyping is indicated, using either amniocentesis or fetal blood sampling, depending upon the urgency of the diagnosis. Fetal echocardiography is mandatory when the ultrasonically detected fetal anomaly is one that is known to be associated frequently with cardiac disease. Based on the antenatal findings, the parents should receive appropriate genetic and perinatal counseling. The management plan should always take into consideration the parents' wishes. Management plans for the most common ultrasonically detected fetal anomalies are presented, based upon review of the literature and authors' experience.\r"

Models using the same simplified approach to estimate fetal weight using BPD with mean abdominal diameter, and femur length with mean abdominal diameter, were also developed. Fetal weight estimate tables for these models involve only one variable, making them easier to use.\r"

Twenty patients had received temporary silicone implants, whereas twelve patients had surgery without disk-replacement implants. Six of the patients with implants had destructive lesions of the mandibular condyles at follow-up examinations, but no such lesions were seen in any of the patients who had surgery without implants. Histologic analysis of material removed from one patient who had a second operation showed multiple particles of foreign material surrounded by focally marked inflammatory reaction with foreign body granulomas. The underlying cartilage and bone showed focal resorption and bone destruction. Electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis showed that the foreign material contained silicone. It was concluded that the radiographically observed destructive lesions of the mandibular condyle may be a sign of a reactive synovitis induced by silicone particles abraded from the silicone implant.\r"

Patients' profiles have been used in a number of ways: in attempts to discriminate between cases; as predictors of both medical treatment and pain management program outcomes; and in attempts to assess degree of disability. Studies reviewed here indicate that the concept of psychological etiology of chronic LBP, despite widespread use, has failed to differentiate patients and to reliably predict response to specific treatment. A promising alternative approach has emerged in recent years: profile distinctions between different types of psychological response to chronic LBP. These subgroups are associated with different pain-related behaviors and may show differential response to various treatments, although further work remains to be done to specify the relationships more precisely. Methodological difficulties that continue to appear in the literature are addressed and recommendations for further developments in the use of the MMPI with this patient population are made.\r"

  ".W": "The paper reviews evidence that adjuvant arthritis in the rat is associated with chronic pain and discusses the time course and measurement of this putative pain. The available evidence is consistent with the view that arthritic rats suffer pain, but it appears difficult to formally establish the occurrence of chronic pain in animals. The data suggest the pain to be severe during weeks 2 and 3 and to persist during weeks 4 and 5 after inoculation. The continuing inflammation of joints likely results in movement-induced acutely elicited pains that may persist till about the 8th week. The severe pain during weeks 2 and 3 may be associated with a depression of some drives, and the entire week 2-8 period is likely associated with varying levels of chronic stress. Neurochemical and neurophysiological studies indicate that adjuvant arthritis profoundly influences several of the neurotransmission and neuroendocrine functions of brain and spinal cord; among the affected systems are substance P-ergic, serotonergic and endorphinergic systems. Adjuvant arthritis in the rat constitutes the only laboratory animal model of chronic pain that has been validated to a significant extent. It is suggested that the model be examined further and that additional animal models of chronic pain be developed.\r"

In the range of temperature subthreshold for polymodal receptors, the responses to algesic substances tested were greater at higher temperatures. The mean discharge rates induced by various concentrations of bradykinin (BK, 9 X 10(-9)-9 X 10(-6) M), were significantly greater at 36 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Responses to hypertonic saline, tested in the temperature range, 34-43 degrees C, showed similar temperature-dependent increases, and Q10 values between 2.3 and 4.2. In the units exhibiting 'heat sensitization' with repeated testing of suprathreshold temperature rises, the response to hypertonic saline (616 mM) at 34 degrees C also increased. Although calor in the inflamed tissues is in itself not high enough to cause excitation of 'pain receptors,' temperature-dependent augmentation of chemical responses of the polymodal receptor might partly explain peripheral hyperalgesic behaviour observable in inflamed tissue on the basis of sensory receptor activity.\r"

Although infants with inborn errors of metabolism will continue to be best cared for in centers with expertise in the treatment of inherited metabolic disease, the initial recognition of these disorders remains the responsibility of the practicing physician. A clinical approach to the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism in the young infant is presented as well as suggestions for the use of readily available laboratory studies that can serve to identify these infants who will benefit from further evaluation and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized study was initiated in neonates with neutropenia (absolute peripheral neutrophil count less than 1,500/microL) and suspected bacterial infection. Twenty infants with proven infection were enrolled, nine of whom had depletion of bone marrow stores of maturing neutrophils (less than or equal to 7% metamyelocyte, band and mature forms per 100 nucleated cells). These nine were randomized to receive 15 mL/kg of either buffy coat transfusions (group 2) or plasma and blood products (group 3). The remaining 11 (group 1) were observed. Peripheral neutrophil counts were monitored to determine the neutrophil response to transfusions. There were ten of 11 patients in group 1, two of four in group 2, and two of five in group 3 who lived at least seven days. No complications of transfusion were noted. No difference in the rate of peripheral neutrophil increase was found among the three groups. The study was stopped when it became clear that sufficient numbers of patients could not be entered into the study, in a reasonable period of time, to prove or disprove a clinically significant improvement in outcome. Although in vitro testing of the buffy coat preparations showed normal function in three of four cases, the clinical quality of the buffy coats may have been inadequate because of poor availability of whole fresh blood less than 24 hours old. The role of neutrophil transfusions in these patients remains unclear.\r"

In the 196 infants completing ophthalmic follow-up, tocopherol did not prevent retinopathy of prematurity of any stage (28% placebo treated v 26% tocopherol treated) or moderately severe retinopathy of prematurity (8% placebo treated v 11% tocopherol treated). Cicatricial sequelae were not significantly different (1/97 placebo treated v 3/99 tocopherol treated), with one placebo-treated infant and one tocopherol-treated infant having retinal detachments. Among all 232 infants examined, those treated with tocopherol had more retinal hemorrhage than placebo-treated infants (8/121 placebo treated v 16/111 tocopherol treated), and retinal hemorrhage correlated positively (P less than .01) with plasma levels of tocopherol after the first 2 weeks of age. Prospective monitoring of morbidity including late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, etc revealed no differences between groups except that grades 3 and 4 intraventricular hemorrhage occurred more frequently in infants weighing less than 1 kg at birth who had received tocopherol (14/42, 33%) v those who had received placebo (4/43, 9%) (P less than .02). Our data do not support the use of tocopherol for prophylaxis against retinopathy of prematurity in premature infants and suggest that IV tocopherol treatment starting on day 1 may increase the incidence of hemorrhagic complications of prematurity, particularly in infants with birth weights of less than 1 kg.\r"

Suctioning induced a slight decrease in mean heart rate and transcutaneous Po2, but pancuronium did not alter these changes.

Nursing interventions such as tracheobronchial suctioning, postural drainage, and providing exogenous humidity to the inspired air are indicated to maintain airway patency, which is the goal of treatment. Suggested areas for future research related to this diagnosis include validation of the signs and symptoms which are proposed as being specific to the causes of ineffective airway clearance and the continuation of experimental studies to demonstrate the efficacy of various interventions for this nursing diagnosis.\r"

Moreover, the mechanisms of respiratory muscle fatigue remain unclear, and clinical methods for diagnosing respiratory muscle fatigue are inconclusive. Until we improve our understanding of respiratory muscle fatigue, interventions are mostly directed toward preventing respiratory muscle fatigue by improving respiratory muscle function. One way to achieve this goal is by inspiratory muscle training. However, further research is needed to elucidate the physiologic mechanisms, clinical implications, and therapeutic interventions for respiratory muscle fatigue so that we can improve the associated ineffective breathing patterns.\r"

Prostaglandins have been shown to inhibit gastric secretion, stimulate bicarbonate secretion, and increase gastric blood volume. Pretreatment with prostaglandins has recently been found to promote rapid restitution of the superficial epithelium of the gastric mucosa and preservation of the deeper layers. These effects and their degree of importance to an individual patient may depend on the insulting agent. Orally administered prostaglandin analogues have been helpful in some patients who failed to heal with standard ulcer treatment and in smokers, who usually do not heal as well as nonsmokers. They have also been effective in persons at high risk for gastric lesions, such as chronic consumers of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or alcohol. Recent reports show that persons with peptic ulcer disease may produce fewer prostanoids than others, so replacement therapy may be useful in preventing damage of the gastroduodenal mucosa.\r"

Low-level exercise testing should be under-taken within three weeks of acute MI, and left ventricular function should be assessed and arrhythmias delineated before the patient's discharge from the hospital. Findings may indicate the need for coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or permanent pacing. Digitalis should be used for treating congestive heart failure only if deemed absolutely necessary. If there are no contraindications, all postinfarction patients should receive beta blockers for at least two years after MI. Control of coronary risk factors is essential.

Some persons mount an appropriate immune response after infection and remain asymptomatic, while others become progressively debilitated by the effects of the infection. Paradoxically, autoimmune disease can coexist with the immunodeficiency state. In addition, HIV has proven to be more versatile in its organ system involvement than a simple lymphotropic virus. The clinical manifestations in seropositive persons are complex and may mimic those of other diseases. Because of this complexity, HIV infection should be an important consideration in all persons from defined risk groups who have an unexplained illness. Although the optimal strategy for curtailing these devastating clinical problems is one of prevention, education and behavior modification have not entirely stopped the spread of any sexually transmitted virus. Vaccine development is being intensively studied but still has many scientific and practical problems to overcome. Failing prevention, the next conceivable level of intervention would be effective antiviral therapy. A multitude of agents have shown promise in vitro, but in vivo data are disappointing. One notable exception is the favorable outcome observed in preliminary trials of azidothymidine. Therapy aimed at reconstituting the immune response also has not lived up to its in vitro promise. A more productive approach in the future may be to combine this type of treatment with antiviral agents. Until more definitive methods become available, however, treating the multiple end-organ complications of HIV infection remains a difficult task.\r"

Cells of one clone that grew in the presence of G418 produce high levels of hepatitis B e antigen and of hepatitis B surface antigen. HBV DNA is carried by these cells as chromosomally integrated sequences and episomally as relaxed circular, covalently closed, and incomplete copies of the HBV genome. Viral DNA was detected also in conditioned growth medium at the buoyant densities characteristic for infectious Dane and immature core particles. Finally, HBV-specific components morphologically identical to the 22-nm spherical and filamentous hepatitis B surface antigen particles as well as 42-nm Dane particles were visualized by immunoelectron microscopic analysis. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the Hep G2 cell line can support the assembly and secretion not only of several of the replicative intermediates of HBV DNA but also of Dane-like particles. This in vitro system can now be used to study the life cycle of HBV and the reaction of immunocompetent cells with cells carrying HBV.\r"

These activities appear to be mediated by a cell-surface receptor for cAMP. We have studied the regulation of this receptor in cells developed in starved suspension cultures exposed to 50 nM pulses of cAMP every 6 min. cAMP-pulsed cells display roughly 10-fold higher cAMP receptor levels than cells that developed on filters or that were starved in suspension without cAMP pulses. Based on saturation binding analysis, the superinduced binding activity represents an increase in receptor number, while receptor affinity for cAMP is unaffected. Photoaffinity labeling of superinduced cells results in specific labeling of the same molecules that are labeled in starved cells. This increased cAMP binding activity was also detected in membrane preparations from cAMP-pulsed cells. These results provide evidence for an unusual mode of receptor regulation: autogenous induction of the receptor by its ligand.\r"

Expression of a 5-fold excess of antisense endo B RNA over endogenous, retinoic acid-induced endo B RNA resulted in suppression of endo B cytokeratin protein expression. In addition, the normal induction of endo A protein, the type II cytokeratin that polymerizes with endo B, was suppressed at the RNA and protein levels. Revertant clones, which synthesize little if any neo or antisense endo B RNA, regain the ability to express the affected gene products in response to retinoic acid.

By contrast, the amount of IGF-I was just measurable and did not vary significantly between tumor and normal tissue. The high amounts of IGF-II in the pheochromocytomas were not reflected, however, by a corresponding increase of mRNA. The opposite situation was found in Wilms tumors, where IGF-II content was in the same range as in nontumor tissues despite increased expression of IGF-II mRNA.\r"

Hamsters were then treated with somatostatin analog D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2 (RC-160) or with [6-D-tryptophan]luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [( D-Trp6]LH-RH) delayed delivery systems. Microcapsules of somatostatin analog RC-160, designed to release a dose of 5 micrograms/day, were injected twice a month and microcapsules of [D-Trp6]LH-RH, calculated to liberate 25 micrograms per day, once a month. After 18 weeks of BOP administration, the hamsters were divided into three groups of 10-20 animals each. Group I consisted of untreated controls, group II was injected with RC-160, and group III was injected with [D-Trp6]LH-RH. A striking decrease in tumor weight and volume was obtained in animals treated with [D-Trp6]LH-RH or with the somatostatin analog RC-160. After 45 days of treatment with either analog, the survival rate was significantly higher in groups II and III (70%), as compared with the control group (35%). The studies, done by light microscopy, high-resolution microscopy, and electron microscopy, showed a decrease in the total number of cancer cells and changes in the epithelium, connective tissue, and cellular organelles in groups II and III treated with the hypothalamic analogs as compared to controls. These results in female hamsters with induced ductal pancreatic tumors confirm and extend our findings, obtained in male animals with transplanted tumors, that [D-Trp6]LH-RH and somatostatin analogs inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancers.\r"

Other divalent cations substitute for Mg2+ poorly or not at all; most of them, including Mn2+, inhibit when added in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+. The enzyme is unstable but can be stabilized by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 20% glycerol. The final preparation shows, on silver-stained electrophoresis gels, two major bands (Mr 41,000 and 35,000). According to gel filtration the molecular weight of the active protein is about 75,000. Of the two subunits, only the smaller one appears to be autophosphorylated. In addition to casein, the enzyme phosphorylates several proteins including the H+-ATPase (Mr 100,000) in the yeast plasma membrane. In order to demonstrate the phosphorylation of the ATPase (up to 0.9 equivalents), exposure of the latter to an acid phosphatase was required. Other phosphorylated proteins include mRNA cap-binding protein from mammalian erythrocytes and yeast, a glucocorticoid receptor protein, and a preparation of the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins Gi and Go from brain. A partial purification of a natural activator from yeast plasma membranes is described.\r"

In the present experiments, the Escherichia coli ptsG locus, which encodes II-BGlc, was isolated from a transducing phage library and subcloned into plasmid vectors. The resulting plasmids complement the following phenotypic defects of ptsG mutants: growth on glucose, uptake and phosphorylation of methyl alpha-D-glucoside, and repression of the utilization of non-PTS sugars by methyl alpha-glucoside. The transformed cells overproduce II-BGlc 4- to 10-fold, and a Mr 43,000 polypeptide was synthesized from the plasmids in an in vitro transcription/translation system.

Four overlapping cDNA clones were characterized that coded for a low molecular weight human collagen. The cDNA clones did not, however, code for the short-chain collagens, types IX and X. The amino acid sequences derived from the clones resembled type IV collagen in that there were short interruptions in the repeating -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- sequence. The noncollagenous, carboxyl-terminal domain was, however, much shorter and contained only 18 amino acid residues. Interestingly, one of the cDNA clones contained an additional 36 nucleotides not found in an overlapping clone. The 36 nucleotides encoded four -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- repeats without changing the reading frame. Nuclease S1 mapping demonstrated that the difference between the clones was due to existence of two different mRNAs. A synthetic 24-residue peptide corresponding to the last two -Gly-Xaa-Yaa- triplets and the entire carboxyl-terminal domain was used to generate polyclonal antibodies. Electrophoretic transfer blot analysis of HT-1080 cells and normal human skin fibroblasts identified two polypeptides, Mr 67,000 and Mr 62,000, that were sensitive to bacterial collagenase.\r"

Conversion of prolysostaphin to the mature enzyme occurs extracellularly in cultures of S. simulans and involves removal of the NH2-terminal portion of the proenzyme that contains the tandem repeats. The high degree of homology of the repeats suggests that they have arisen by duplication of a 39-base-pair sequence of DNA.

For that purpose, the association of the monoclonal antibodies with either the beta 2 subunit or its isolated domains was studied by using fluorescence energy transfer between tryptophan residues of the antibodies and a dansyl group covalently linked to the antigen. It is shown that the association of both monoclonal antibodies with the antigen occurs within a few seconds after initiation of the renaturation, whereas complete refolding of the beta 2 subunit requires several minutes under the same experimental conditions. Thus, immunoreactive intermediates appear to be formed at an early stage of the folding process. While the isolated F1 domain alone is able to rapidly refold into a conformational intermediate already well recognized by the anti-native-beta 2 antibody, it cannot, in the absence of the F2 domain, reach its native conformation. However, its association with the anti-native-beta 2 antibody induces a structural change of F1 that brings it closer to the conformation it normally adopts when interacting with F2 inside the native beta 2 subunit.\r"

The COOH-terminal domain carries the channel activity. The effects of the alterations in the polypeptide chain on the secretion of colicin A by colicinogenic cells have been investigated. All deletions and some mutations were found to lead to protein aggregation in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing release into the medium. The mutated colicin A proteins have been purified, and their activity in vivo (on sensitive cells) and in vitro (in planar lipid bilayers) has been assayed. Deletions in the region containing putative helices 4, 5, and 6 (predicted to be involved in pore formation) and the transitions (Ala----Asp-492, Phe----Pro-493) in helix 4 abolished the activity. No correlation was observed between mutations leading to protein aggregation and those leading to loss of channel activity. Some mutations were found to alter characteristic properties of the single channels, such as stability, current-relaxation kinetics, voltage dependence, and pore conductance. Site-directed mutagenesis provides a powerful tool for studying structure-function relationships of voltage-sensitive ionic channels.\r"

RPB2 encodes a protein of 138,750 daltons, which contains sequences implicated in binding purine nucleotides and zinc ions and exhibits striking sequence homology with the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. These observations suggest that the yeast and the E. coli subunit have similar roles in RNA synthesis, as the beta subunit contains binding sites for nucleotide substrates and a portion of the catalytic site for RNA synthesis.

This approach is based on 15N (or 13C) labeling of selected residues in a protein. The resonances from protons directly bonded to labeled atoms are detected in a two-dimensional 1H-15N (or 13C) spectrum. The nuclear Overhauser effects from isotopically tagged protons are selectively observed in one-dimensional isotope-directed measurements. Using this approach, we have observed approximately 160 resonances from 15N-bonded protons in the backbone and sidechains of uniformly 15N-labeled T4 lysozyme (molecular mass = 18.7 kDa). Partial proton-deuterium exchange can be used to simplify the 1H-15N spectrum of this protein. These resonances are identified by amino acid class using selective incorporation of 15N-labeled amino acids and are assigned to specific residues by mutational substitution, multiple 15N and 13C labeling, and isotope-directed nuclear Overhauser effect measurements. For example, using a phenyl[15N]alanine-labeled lysozyme variant containing two consecutive phenylalanine residues in an alpha-helical region, we observe an isotope-directed nuclear Overhauser effect from the amide proton of Phe-66 to that of Phe-67.\r"

In favor of this view is the recently reported expression of such genes during mouse embryogenesis [Manley, J. L. & Levine, M. S. (1985) Cell 43, 1-2]. The embryo-derived stem cells and in particular the pluripotent embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines are generally considered as a valid model of early mouse development. Homeobox-containing genes were shown to be expressed in differentiating EC cells. We have analyzed the expression of several of these genes in three EC cell lines triggered to differentiate by alternative treatments in the presence or in the absence of retinoic acid. In both types of conditions, C17S1 (clone 1003) and PCC7.S Aza R1 EC cells were induced to differentiate into mainly neurones, and PSA-1 EC cells were induced to differentiate into a large spectrum of tissue derivatives. Induction to high levels of expression of several homeobox-containing genes during differentiation occurs only in the presence of retinoic acid. Nonchemical treatment triggering differentiation does not lead to detectable expression of these genes. Accumulation to high amounts of homeobox-containing gene transcripts in these experiments seems to correlate with retinoic acid-induced EC cell differentiation rather than with EC cell differentiation as such.\r"

  ".W": "In most human follicular lymphomas, the chromosome translocation t(14;18) occurs within two breakpoint clustering regions on chromosome 18, the major one at the 3' untranslated region of the bcl-2 gene and the minor one at 3' of the gene. Analysis of a panel of follicular lymphoma DNAs using probes for the first exon of the bcl-2 gene indicates that DNA rearrangements may also occur 5' to the involved bcl-2 gene. In this case the IgH locus and the bcl-2 gene are found in the order 3' C gamma S gamma/mu JH 5'::5' bcl-2 3' (where C = constant, S = switch, and JH = joining segment of the heavy chain locus), suggesting that an inversion also occurred during the translocation process. The coding regions of the bcl-2 gene, however, are left intact in all cases of follicular lymphoma studied to date.\r"

  ".W": "Transcription of PHO5 is strongly regulated in response to the level of inorganic phosphate (Pi) present in the growth medium. We have identified elements required for PHO5 expression by analyzing small deletions in the PHO5 promoter on chromosome II. The results reveal three functionally different components of the PHO5 promoter: regulatory regions, a \"TATA\" element, and specific mRNA initiation sites. The regulatory regions contain related 19-base-pair (bp) dyad sequences acting as phosphate-controlled upstream activation sites (UASpS). These UASpS mediate the transcriptional activation of PHO5 observed in low Pi conditions. The unlinked but coordinately regulated PHO11 promoter contains a single copy of an almost identical dyad sequence, suggesting that there is a common regulatory UASp for both genes. A TATA element is absolutely required for detectable PHO5 transcription. Specific purine-pyrimidine motifs (RRYRR) (R = purine and Y = pyrimidine) serve as PHO5 mRNA initiation sites, but only if they lie 55-110 bp downstream of a functional TATA element. Such an \"initiation window\" is not found in higher eukaryotes and implies mechanistic differences in the transcription machineries between yeast and higher eukaryotes.\r"

The v-abl oncogene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a trpE/v-abl fusion protein from the trp promoter. The expression plasmid was mutagenized in vitro and then transfected into E. coli. Bacteria that produced defective tyrosine kinases were distinguished from those producing wild-type v-abl kinases by hybridization with antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine. Two independent mutations that generated temperature-sensitive tyrosine kinases were found to be located in a 12-amino acid region in the tyrosine kinase domain of the v-abl-encoded protein. These mutant v-abl oncogenes displayed temperature-sensitive transforming activity when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Cells transformed by these temperature-sensitive tyrosine kinase mutants could be shifted between the transformed and untransformed states by changing their growth temperature. These results confirmed the crucial role of tyrosine kinase activity in the v-abl-mediated oncogenesis.\r"

We have measured insulin binding to cells of an HLA-heterozygous, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell line, LCL 721, and to derivative mutants from which all or part of the HLA complex had been deleted. The affinity, Ka, of insulin binding sites is approximately 10(8) M-1 in mutants expressing antigen HLA-B5 together with other HLA antigens and in mutants expressing only HLA-C.

The oligonucleotides were polymerized by ligation, and the resulting multimers were cloned into an expression vector. One construct that contained four copies of the repeat was expressed in Escherichia coli. The product, a fusion protein, was soluble and produced in high amounts. It reacted in immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody to a synthetic octapeptide (Glu-Glu-Asn-Val-Glu-His-Asp-Ala). Rabbits immunized with partially purified fusion protein, either with or without adjuvant, formed antibodies against this octapeptide. These antibodies reacted with Pf155 both in parasite extracts and when deposited in the membrane of infected erythrocytes. Furthermore, these antibodies inhibited merozoite reinvasion in vitro as efficiently as human antibodies to the octapeptide sequence in Pf155, induced by natural infection. The results suggest that products of synthetic gene constructs may be a suitable basis for an anti-merozoite vaccine.\r"

The effect of these changes on the replicative and cytopathologic properties of the virus was studied by transfecting modified virus clones into cultured human cells. Mutations in the gag, pol, env, and tat regions precluded virus replication and cytopathology in lymphoid cells. A mutation in orf-A dramatically reduced but did not abolish virus replication. Mutant viruses with deletions in the orf-B region were highly cytopathic and replicated to approximately 5-fold higher levels than wild-type virus. They also produced approximately 5-fold more viral DNA in infected lymphoid cells than did wild-type virus. Thus, the orf-B region may function to down-regulate virus replication. This mutational analysis of the HIVSF2 genome is a means of assessing genes regulating viral replication and cytopathology.\r"

Because of biological compensatory mechanisms and the shortcomings of techniques for measuring SDs, physical therapists may be unaware of the motor involvement of patients with SNRC lesions. The application of appropriate evaluation procedures should enable physical therapists to identify the SDs and monitor their response to therapeutic interventions. These interventions should be applied with appreciation of the potential for causing further damage from overworking the weakened muscles.\r"

A modified Hynes pharyngoplasty has been used in 40 patients, aged 4 to 52, over a 4-year period for velopharyngeal incompetence of varying etiologic causes. Speech was assessed before and at least 6 months after pharyngoplasty. At the same time, radiologic and, when possible, nasendoscopic investigations were undertaken. Thirty-eight patients had no or variable nasal escape (variable defined as achieving intermittent closure), whereas 33 had normal or slight hyponasal resonance. There was only one complication, an asymptomatic dehiscence of the \"bucket handle\" flap from the posterior wall. Thirteen patients had an assortment of side effects, none requiring surgical treatment. We believe that patients who are suitable for the described sphincter pharyngoplasty are those with slight or moderate nasal escape having a mobile palate with an anteroposterior gap of 5 mm or less.\r"

None of the patients had superficial sensibility of any other modality. No neurofilament-positive sensory nerve fibers were observed in the dermis or epidermis. In one patient nerve fibers were detected in the subcutaneous tissue. It is concluded that patients will have deep pressure sensibility of the flap area even early after the operation and that most patients will develop a heat pain sensitivity, probably due to subcutaneous reinnervation.\r"

A technique for renal donor angiography using semiselective aortography is described.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasound and computed tomography are very useful in the diagnosis of parenchymal and urologic abnormalities after renal transplantation. The increased use of Doppler duplex sonography will further enhance the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of patients with kidney transplants. Computed tomography is of particular value in the setting of suspected posttransplant malignancy. Both imaging techniques can be used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic interventional radiologic procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Experience with MRI in transplant patients is limited. The normal transplant kidney is characterized by a sharply defined corticomedullary border on T1 weighted images. Loss of CMC is seen in transplant rejection and in some patients with ATN. Presence of CMC does not rule out rejection, however. The spectrum of changes in cyclosporine toxicity is unclear, as only a few patients have been reported. For heart, liver, and pancreas transplantation magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging may prove useful in the evaluation of organ viability preoperatively and in early detection of rejection. Carefully designed prospective studies are needed to better define the role of MRI in organ transplantation.\r"
