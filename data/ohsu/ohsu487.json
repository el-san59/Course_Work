Preventable causes appear to be common: failing to appreciate the severity of the illness and undertreatment, particularly with steroids. Thus, an objective data base, early treatment, and frequent reassessment are of paramount importance. Despite intensive therapeutic intervention, mechanical ventilation may be required. In managing the ventilator in these patients, efforts should be directed at minimizing peak airway pressures while vigorous conventional modalities are continued. The need to use mechanical ventilation does not imply that the course of the disease will worsen, and the long-term outlook generally is good. Thus, even a low mortality rate is troubling. Once the acute process has resolved, educating the patient and close follow-up are essential.\r"

  ".W": "The symptom complex currently designated the chronic fatigue syndrome was previously termed the chronic or chronic active Epstein-Barr virus syndrome or the chronic mononucleosis syndrome, prematurely assuming an etiologic role for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This presumption derived from the fact that some patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have very high or very low titers of certain antibodies to EBV. A review of seroepidemiologic patterns of response to EBV and of studies of patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome shows that these antibody titers overlap considerably both with those of controls or other healthy persons and with those of patients with other illnesses. Given the high prevalence of exposure to EBV, it would be difficult to determine whether the virus caused the syndrome or whether the antibody elevations resulted from the illness, even if distinct differences in titers existed. Other methodologic issues of control selection, laboratory test comparability, and differing case definitions pose problems in studying this syndrome. The recently published working case definition should facilitate the continuing search for causes.\r"

  ".W": "Loratadine is an addition to the class of nonsedating antihistamines which includes terfenadine, astemizole, and acrivastine. Loratadine is chemically related to the tricyclic antidepressants. Animal data have shown that insignificant amounts of loratadine enter the brain, and it has a threefold greater affinity for peripheral as compared with central histamine 1-receptors. Loratadine has one main metabolite, descarbethoxyloratadine, which is four times more active than the parent drug. Loratadine reaches peak plasma concentration in 1-2 hours; the metabolite does so in 3-4 hours. Their respective elimination half-lives are about 10 and 20 hours. Onset of action is within 1 hour and duration is at least 24 hours. Once-daily dosing is recommended. Generally, loratadine is as efficacious as existing antihistamines in relieving symptoms of allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and in suppressing wheal formation. Reports of sedation and other adverse reactions are no more frequent than found with placebo. Tachyphylaxis has not been noted in humans, and there is minimal potential for drug interactions based on animal data. Loratadine and terfenadine have comparable therapeutic applications. Both have shown minimal adverse effects, but loratadine has a quicker onset and longer duration of action. These two agents are useful for acute allergic reactions. In contrast, astemizole has an onset of action of several days and is most useful for prophylactic treatment of seasonal allergies.\r"

Nimodipine has low oral bioavailability (2.7-27.9 percent), a short half-life (2 h), is highly protein bound (98-99 percent), and is hepatically metabolized. Clinical studies have evaluated topical, intravenous, and oral administration of nimodipine for the treatment of cerebral artery spasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. These studies document some benefit of the drug in reducing the occurrence of severe neurologic deficit, although this effect is not universal. Few adverse effects have been noted. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics, the appropriate dose and route of administration, adverse effects, drug interactions, and the therapeutic efficacy of nimodipine before routine use can be recommended.\r"

Although adverse reactions are noted, they generally fall into a category of mild effects which necessitate a therapeutic change--and little evaluation. We present a case of a severe reaction to two antiseizure medications. Characteristic findings of lymphadenopathy, fever, exfoliative dermatitis, eosinophilia and hepatic damage are well described as a hypersensitive reaction to phenytoin, often called \"pseudolymphoma.\" Phenobarbital also produces a clinically indistinguishable syndrome of pseudolymphoma, which is not widely recognized. A case report and review of the literature are presented. We conclude that phenytoin and phenobarbital hypersensitivity reactions are probably mediated by a similar mechanism. This appears to be an extreme extension of the more common and less severe reactions to these medications. Clinical studies in primary care can better elucidate this potentially fatal reaction.\r"

Because of this, diverse invasive and noninvasive diagnostic techniques have been investigated to identify patients with RVI. Electrocardiography is the most available, simple, and objective of these techniques. Numerous ECG signs of RVI have been described and some of them, especially ST segment elevation and patterns of necrosis (QS, QR) in the right precordial leads (V3R to V5R), have a very high sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value for the detection of RVI. ST segment elevation in lead V4R is also helpful in identifying the occluded coronary artery in patients with acute myocardial infarction, which could have great importance in their management. Hence, a 12-lead ECG with the right precordial leads (V3R to V6R) should be a routine part of the initial evaluation of patients with clinical suspicion of acute inferior myocardial infarction. This article reviews the value, limitations, and pathogenesis of the ECG manifestations of RVI.\r"

  ".W": "A compilation of drug interactions between H2 antagonists and cardiovascular drugs is found in Table I. Cimetidine's potency, lipophilicity, and affinity for binding to the P-450 cytochrome system can probably be attributed to the drug interactions that have been identified with the H2 antagonists. The mechanism for most cimetidine drug interactions is inhibition of hepatic metabolism. There is conflicting evidence regarding significance of altered liver blood flow for both cimetidine and ranitidine and their influence on other agents. Cimetidine may increase propranolol's blood concentrations and potentiate beta blocking effects through inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes and possibly through reduction of hepatic blood flow. Ranitidine has no effect on propranolol. Cimetidine, when administered concurrently with metoprolol, could possibly cause an increase in plasma metoprolol concentrations or bioavailability through inhibition of hepatic P-450 metabolizing enzymes. No effect of cimetidine on metoprolol pharmacodynamics was evident. Ranitidine has no effect on metoprolol pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Neither H2 antagonist altered the kinetics or physiologic effects of atenolol. Atenolol is the drug of choice in patients receiving H2 antagonists, since no interaction has been observed. Metoprolol could probably be used safely in most patients, as no change in pharmacodynamics has been evident. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and nifedipine may result in alterations in heart rate and blood pressure. The mechanism is inhibition of oxidative liver metabolism. Ranitidine has no effect on nifedipine. Studies are needed to investigate the interaction between the H2 antagonists and diltiazem or verapamil. Cimetidine, given concomitantly with lidocaine, may increase lidocaine concentrations and clinical symptoms of lidocaine toxicity. The mechanism involved is probably a reduction in oxidative drug metabolism or liver blood flow. Ranitidine has no significant effects on lidocaine pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine may increase quinidine levels and symptoms of quinidine toxicity. Additionally, enhanced arrhythmic effects may be observed. The interaction probably caused by an inhibition of hepatic drug metabolism of quinidine by cimetidine would be most significant in patients with liver disease and in the elderly. Ranitidine may enhance quinidine's arrhythmic effect. Cimetidine can possibly increase procainamide and NAPA serum concentrations, especially in the elderly and in patients with renal dysfunction, predisposing them to adverse side effects. The interaction is mediated by a reduction of tubular secretion of procainamide and NAPA.\r"

Pacing induced no ischemia in non-CAD patients; in CAD patients, intolerable angina developed in less than 5 minutes. However, glucose infusion in the latter group increased the time to onset of angina (110 +/- 24 seconds before infusion versus 140 +/- 24 seconds following infusion) and decreased the extent of ST segment depression (1.8 +/- 0.3 mm before infusion versus 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm following infusion, p less than 0.01) following pacing. In all subjects, arterial levels and cardiac uptake of glucose rose by 100% (p less than 0.001) and those of free fatty acids fell by 50% (p less than 0.01). Arterial lactate and uptake of lactate by nonischemic myocardium increased by 30% (p less than 0.05). During pacing in CAD patients, this elevated uptake was outweighed by similar increases of lactate release from ischemic areas, leaving mean negative global exchanges unaltered. In CAD patients solely, rebuilding of cardiac glycogen after pacing was suggested from augmented citrate efflux in the control period but not during glucose infusion, suggesting a glycogen-sparing effect. Arterial concentrations and net cardiac fluxes of oxygen, glutamate, and alanine remained unaltered. In conclusion, beneficial effects of glucose during ischemia are associated with increased aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, saving of glycogen, and decreased lipolysis.\r"

However, the neurohumoral mechanisms for this impairment are not defined. We assessed the responses of arterial pressure, FVR, plasma norepinephrine, and plasma renin activity to lower body negative pressure in 29 patients with compensated CHF (New York Heart Association class III and IV) and in 11 normal age-matched control subjects. Baseline mean arterial pressure (83 +/- 2 vs 84 +/- 2 mm Hg) and mean arterial pressure during LBNP (-10, -20, and -40 mm Hg) were not significantly different in the two groups. Basal FVR (43.7 +/- 4 vs 27 +/- 2 units), plasma norepinephrine (605 +/- 81 vs 155 +/- 8 pg/ml), and plasma renin activity (8.3 +/- 1.7 vs 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr) were significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in patients with CHF. The relative increases in FVR responses during LBNP of -10, -20, and -40 mm Hg (10 +/- 4% vs 70 +/- 12%, 17 +/- 6% vs 106 +/- 21%, and 24 +/- 9% vs 152 +/- 28%) were markedly attenuated in patients with CHF compared to control subjects. Plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity responses during LBNP were also attenuated in patients with heart failure. Our results suggest that baroreflex control of FVR and plasma norepinephrine and plasma renin activity is impaired in CHF because of the inability of the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors to alter sympathetic outflow.\r"

  ".W": "Dobutamine has been shown to exert disparate clinical effects in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This study evaluated the effects of dobutamine on hemodynamics and energetics in isolated, perfused myopathic hamster hearts at a moderate and advanced stage of heart failure. Biochemical changes were correlated with left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption. During dobutamine treatment left ventricular developed pressure increased in the control and moderate heart failure group 28.0 +/- 1.0% and 114.2 +/- 11.6%, respectively. Myocardial oxygen consumption increased 50.1 +/- 9.1% and 45.5 +/- 16.0%, respectively. There were no significant changes of left ventricular developed pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption in the advanced heart failure group. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) increased in the control group from 6.8 +/- 0.5 to 11.4 +/- 1.2 mmol (p less than 0.005) and in the advanced heart failure group from 10.4 +/- 1.1 to 15.3 +/- 1.2 mmol (p less than 0.01). Phosphocreatine (PCr) and beta-ATP (adenosine triphosphate) decreased in the control group from 12.2 +/- 0.4 to 8.7 +/- 0.7 mmol (p less than 0.001) and 10.4 +/- 0.8 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 mmol (p less than 0.02), respectively. PCr/Pi ratio, reflecting mitochondrial function, fell in the control and advanced heart failure group from 1.84 +/- 0.14 to 0.84 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.02) and 0.81 +/- 0.16 to 0.37 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.03), respectively. Thus in cardiomyopathic hamsters dobutamine improved mechanical performance and thermodynamic efficiency in moderate stages of heart failure by improving mitochondrial activity, but did not improve mechanical performance in an advanced stage of heart failure. These experiments provide into the disparate clinical effects of dobutamine at various stages of heart failure.\r"

Mean blood pressure increased significantly after both maneuvers (27% during isometric stress and 10.7% during mental stress), but the increase was significantly higher during isometric stress (p less than 0.001). Both stressors increased the heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.001). However, the total peripheral resistance behaved differently, for it increased during isometric stress (p less than 0.05) and remained unchanged during mental stress. Both stressors increased the epinephrine levels (p less than 0.005), but only isometric stress increased the norepinephrine levels (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that both stressors increase cardiac output by way of an increase in heart rate, but isometric stress also increases total peripheral resistance and thus causes a greater increase in arterial pressure. Isometric stress activates both the adrenergic and noradrenergic systems, thereby accounting for the exaggerated response in arterial pressure, whereas mental stress stimulates the adrenergic system only.\r"

Because dyspnea and fatigue are prime symptoms and sources of clinical distress, the index helps reflect the quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure. In double-blind trials of therapy, changes in the index showed good correlations with patients' self-selected ratings of improvement.

  ".W": "Because the reestablishment of coronary blood flow is believed to be central to the benefit of thrombolytic therapy, measurements of reperfusion (i.e., angiography before and after therapy), patency (i.e., angiography after therapy) and reocclusion rates are important to the evaluation of new thrombolytic therapies. For anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC, anistreplase), comparisons have been made with control or placebo therapies to assess absolute efficacy, and with streptokinase to assess relative efficacy. In pooled experience from reperfusion studies, APSAC (30 U over 2 to 5 minutes) led to angiographic reperfusion in 55% of patients (98 of 177) who had symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (MI) for less than 6 hours. Among 107 patients treated with APSAC in angiographic patency studies, 69% (74) showed an open infarct-related artery 1 to 4 hours after therapy. (Patency rates are generally 10 to 20% greater than reperfusion rates, because some patients with acute MI may have a patent [subtotally occluded or spontaneously reperfused] infarct-related artery when entered into patency studies.) Using early peaking (less than or equal to 15 hours) of the creatine kinase curve as an indicator, a patency rate of 63% was observed among 387 patients treated with APSAC. The initial success rate with thrombolytic therapies is diminished by the rates of reocclusion and reinfarction, which must be accounted for in determining the net success of therapy. In 6 studies, a total of 87 patients with initially patent arteries after APSAC returned for reevaluation in 1 to 3 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In cases of acute myocardial infarction (MI), it has been shown that preserving left ventricular function and limiting infarct size with early reperfusion of the occluded artery by means of a thrombolytic agent could eventually result in a reduced mortality rate. The aim of the APSIM study (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex [APSAC] dans l'infarctus du Myocarde) was to demonstrate that early administration of APSAC in patients with recent acute MI could limit the infarct size and preserve left ventricular systolic function. In all, 231 patients with a first acute MI were randomly allocated to either APSAC (30 U over 5 minutes) or to conventional heparin therapy (5,000 IU in bolus injection) within 5 hours of the onset of symptoms. Of these patients, 112 received APSAC and 119 received heparin within a mean period of 188 +/- 62 minutes after the onset of symptoms. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 77% in the APSAC group and 36% in the heparin group (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction determined from contrast angiography was significantly higher in the APSAC than in the heparin group. This was true for the entire population (0.53 +/- 0.13 vs 0.47 +/- 0.13, p = 0.002) as well as for the subgroups of anterior and inferior wall infarctions (0.47 +/- 0.13 vs 0.4 +/- 0.16, p = 0.004 and 0.56 +/- 0.11 vs 0.51 +/- 0.09, p = 0.02).

All of the activators ultimately degrade substrate through plasmin, resulting in a striking hypocoagulable state characterized primarily by a decrease in fibrinogen concentration. Infusion regimens are inversely proportional to the half-life of the activator, which is relatively long with anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), intermediate for streptokinase (SK) and urokinase (UK), and very short for recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and recombinant single-chain urokinase plasminogen activator (scu-PA). After therapy is discontinued, hypofibrinogenemia persists until activator is cleared from the blood, then is slowly corrected over 48 hours, regardless of which thrombolytic agent has been used. Coagulation and platelet activity may be transiently accentuated soon after administration of the agent. Hypercoagulability contributes to vascular reocclusion, especially when acting in concert with the thrombogenic influences of residual thrombus and the original ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. In the first 3 to 4 hours after symptom onset, coronary artery reperfusion can be achieved with all of the thrombolytic agents in 50 to 60% of patients, with a greater thrombolytic potential of rt-PA over SK in thrombi of greater than 4 hours' duration. After coronary artery reperfusion, reocclusion occurs in 10 to 20% of patients, more often after rt-PA than SK treatment. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin decrease the incidence of reocclusion and when added to either SK or rt-PA, decrease mortality after acute myocardial infarction by half. APSAC appears to have a maximal beneficial effect in reducing mortality even without aspirin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After follow-up of 1,004 patients for 30 days after randomization in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, researchers found that 61 patients (12.2%) in the placebo group had died compared with 32 patients (6.4%) in the APSAC group (p = 0.0016). Incomplete follow-up of these patients for 1 year provided an estimated mortality of 19.4% in the placebo group and 10.8% in the APSAC group (log-rank test for survival to year p = 0.0006). Benefit was seen irrespective of age, site of infarction and time from onset of symptoms up to 6 hours.\r"

To give treatment before admission to a coronary care unit, responsibility needs to be transferred from cardiologists to other physicians working in mobile care units. We conducted a 2-part feasibility study to investigate this strategy. Part 1 evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of mobile care unit physicians. Results from this study indicate that with regard to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, the risk of a wrong diagnosis is low. Part 2 was a placebo-controlled trial involving 100 patients in which 57 received anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC) (30 U) at home and 43 received placebo at home. Patients receiving placebo at home were reevaluated on arrival in a coronary care unit and received APSAC (30 U) if indicated. The main results were that (1) diagnostic accuracy was good--all patients had an acute coronary syndrome and 97 of 100 patients had myocardial infarction; (2) time gain was approximately 60 minutes; (3) coronary patency rate was 72%; (4) ejection fraction was higher in the prehospital group (56.7%) than in the control group (53.4%), but the difference was not significant; (5) there was no rhythmic or bleeding complication related to the prehospital treatment; (6) 5 patients died from cardiogenic shock--2 between home and hospital and 3 in the hospital (3 received thrombolytic treatment at home and 2 received placebo at home and APSAC in the hospital); and (7) prehospital administration of APSAC did not induce a delay in arrival to the coronary care unit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Data available experimentally and from major trials suggest that the beneficial effects of thrombolysis depend on more than simple reperfusion. New knowledge regarding the dynamic nature of clot formation and clot lysis enables us to understand more of the processes involved in thrombolysis. The breakdown of systemic fibrinogen may be important because of the anticoagulant effect this can produce. Other beneficial effects of thrombolysis remain unproved or obscure. It is unlikely that any thrombolytic agent can be completely free of risk because no distinction is possible between a hemostatic plug and a pathologic thrombus. There may, however, be differences between agents in the likelihood of reocclusion. The value of active intervention with angioplasty or bypass grafting after thrombolysis remains undefined. Three major trials suggest that little erosion of initial benefit occurs over the first 12 months even when management is largely conservative. If thrombolysis leads to smaller infarct size, however, prognosis should be influenced favorably over a prolonged period. Parallel mortality curves between treated and placebo groups therefore suggest that some attrition is occurring to counteract what might otherwise be continuing prognostic benefit. The ideal thrombolytic agent should be inexpensive to manufacture, have a low risk of hemorrhagic complications, be nonallergenic, provide rapid and complete thrombolysis, have some anticoagulant properties, be easy to administer and suitable for readministration. However, a low risk of hemorrhage is probably incompatible with effective thrombolysis. A comparison of mortality results with the 3 existing agents are awaited with interest.\r"

Treatment was titrated to produce at least a 30% increase in treadmill exercise duration over placebo baseline and then maintained at that dosage for an additional 3 weeks. Both treatments produced significant (p less than 0.001) increases in duration of exercise, total work and exercise capacity when compared with placebo baseline. These improvements in exercise performance were obtained with significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in both ST-segment depression and rate-pressure product for atenolol compared with nifedipine. Furthermore, the total angina attack rate and rate at rest were significantly (p less than 0.01) less frequent with atenolol than with nifedipine. Hence, the antiischemic effects of atenolol exceeded those of nifedipine, based on ST-segment depression and rate-pressure product at comparable workloads.\r"

The mean follow-up period was 30 months. In 28 patients (44%) arrhythmia control was achieved with the pacemaker therapy alone. In 31 patients (49%) drug therapy had to be reintroduced to obtain control of recurrent arrhythmias. Four patients (6%) were definite nonresponders. In 4 patients (6%) the pulse generator was explanted either because it was not tolerated or because of tachycardia-sensing failure. No syncope or death was observed during follow-up. Thus, antitachycardia pacing gives satisfactory results in selected patients with drug-refractory supraventricular tachycardias.\r"

This multicenter study examined the effectiveness and safety of once-daily administration with doxazosin, a quinazoline analog alpha 1-receptor blocking drug with a plasma half-life of 19 hours. Patients with diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 90 to 115 mm Hg entered 4 weeks of single-blind placebo therapy and then were randomized to double-blind treatment with doxazosin (63 patients) or placebo (67 patients). After 10 weeks of titration, standing arterial BP was lowered by 14/11 mm Hg with doxazosin and by 0.5/0.9 mm Hg with placebo (p less than 0.001). Measured hourly for 12 hours after the dose, all standing and supine arterial BP values were significantly lower in the doxazosin group at each hour. Pulse rate increased slightly in both groups int he double-blind phase, but the increase with doxazosin never significantly exceeded that of placebo. Dizziness was the most common complaint with doxazosin, but syncope did not occur. Side effects were mild and transient and did not necessitate withdrawing any participants from the study. Body weight increased by 1.5 kg in the doxazosin group and decreased by 0.2 kg in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). Safe and effective in once-daily administration, doxazosin is suitable for initial therapy in mild and moderate hypertension.\r"

Mitral, tricuspid, aortic and pulmonic regurgitations were sought in all possible views and mitral and tricuspid flow velocities were recorded. Mitral and tricuspid anulus diameters and the maximal areas of regurgitant flow were planimetered. Regurgitation of at least one of the cardiac valves was found in 91% of athletes but in only 38% of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation occurred more commonly in athletes than in control subjects (mitral 69 vs 27%; tricuspid 76 vs 15%). The prevalence of aortic and pulmonic regurgitation was similar. Although athletes and sedentary normal subjects differed with respect to heart rate, right and left ventricular filling patterns and tricuspid and mitral anulus diameters, none of these variables was related to the presence or severity of regurgitation. Thus, exercise training is associated with an increased prevalence of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and altered ventricular inflow patterns. The mechanism of these findings is unclear. Multivalvular regurgitation is common in athletes and does not imply structural valvular abnormalities.\r"

Successful implantation was achieved in 42 patients (98%). In 25 patients a residual shunt was seen on angiography immediately after implantation. In 12 patients a residual ductal shunt was detected by Doppler 24 hours after implantation; 6-week follow-up studies showed a small residual shunt in only 3 patients. After a second occluder device was implanted in 2 of these patients, complete closure of the patient ductus arteriosus was achieved. In 1 patient, early in the series, the occluder device embolized to the left pulmonary artery, necessitating surgical removal at the time of ductus division. This event was the only serious complication; there were no deaths.\r"

The history will help to determine whether a criminal act has been committed and which agencies need to be notified. The American Board of Forensic Odontology published criteria for bite mark analysis in 1984 that included a description of the bite mark including its size, shape, and color, along with techniques for collection of evidence from both the victim and suspect. To determine bite mark age, tissue response to injury (inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and matrix formation and remodeling) is reviewed. Finally, the bacteria that are found in these wounds and the proper use of antimicrobial agents are expanded upon.\r"

Custer's troops and the Northern Plains Indian tribes. Similarly, skeleton remains of the Indian tribes of the Pre-Columbian and Columbian periods have been studied to answer many questions regarding life and death in those early civilizations. The Ripper Project began as a research activity of the Milton Helpern International Center for the Forensic Sciences at Wichita State University Wichita, Kansas, in 1981, after the concept had been discussed in a night session during the annual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Los Angeles. These century-old serial murders of five prostitutes--The Whitechapel Murders--in London in 1888 were discussed in great detail from the standpoints of the forensic pathologist, the forensic psychiatrist, the criminalist, the forensic historian, and the forensic dentist. The information gained during this phase of the project plus the advances made possible by the development of criminal personality profiling by the FBI led to the present status of this project, which was recently discussed in a live telecast, and which is the subject of this article.\r"

Repeated sonographically guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) obtained only blood, suggesting the possible vascular nature of the tumor. Splenectomy established the diagnosis of splenic hemangioma (SH) with marked sclerotic changes. We conclude from this case that 1) the sclerotic and cystic changes in the SH and the abdominal lymphadenopathy could explain why the three-phase red blood cell and CT scanning, respectively, suggested that the lesion was malignant rather than benign; 2) guided FNA of a splenic mass suspected to be hemangioma may be an additional safe and useful diagnostic procedure. Multiple aspirations yielding blood alone suggest hemangioma and may prevent an unnecessary operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the literature of FNA of splenic hemangioma.\r"

The complications were macroscopic hematuria in 28 biopsies, prolonged hematuria (greater than 24 hours) in eight, transient anuria in five, and prolonged anuria requiring surgical intervention in one. Perinephric hematoma occurred in three patients; retroperitoneal hematoma led to compression of the iliac vein in one. None of these complications led to loss of the transplant.

  ".W": "To identify factors related to the development of uremic acquired cystic disease of the kidney, native and grafted kidneys were examined in four men and three women after kidney transplantation. The incidence and severity of cystic transformation of native kidneys and grafts were compared by plain computed tomographic scans. In a uremic environment (serum creatinine level of greater than or equal to 265 mumol/L [3 mg/dL] for an average of 5.0 years; range, 2.8 to 8.2 years), acquired renal cysts were formed in both the native kidneys and the graft in three of the male and one of the female patients. Cysts were extensive in the native kidneys but relatively infrequent in the grafts in three of the men. One male subject was found to have acquired cysts only in the native kidney. Acquired renal cysts developed even in grafts undergoing chronic rejection, and increased numbers were found in native kidneys that were in uremic conditions for long periods, both before and after renal transplantation. These results suggest that the duration of uremia is the most important factor in the development of acquired renal cysts.\r"

It is unclear whether the compensatory hypertrophy that follows the destruction of nephrons is under the control of growth factors, but they undoubtedly participate in various forms of progressive renal injury, including chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases via autocrine, paracrine, and possibly even endocrine routes. As new developments occur in this rapidly changing field, it is hoped that this knowledge can be used to ameliorate the damage, halt the progression, or enhance the recovery from a disease process in the kidney and in other tissues.\r"

  ".W": "An autosomal recessive (AR) form of muscular dystrophy that clinically resembles Duchenne/Becker types exists, but its frequency is unknown. We have studied three unrelated affected brother/sister pairs and their families for deletions and polymorphisms with the entire dystrophin cDNA and other DNA probes from the Xp21 region to test for involvement of the DMD locus. In family 1 a large intragenic deletion was found in the affected male. The affected sister was heterozygous for this deletion, but the mother was not, implying germinal mosaicism. In family 2, no deletion was detected in the affected male. RFLP analysis revealed that the affected male and an unaffected sister shared a complete Xp21 haplotype while the affected sister had inherited a recombinant Xp21 region resulting from a crossover between pERT 87-15 and J-Bir. Only the 5' region of the dystrophin gene was shared with the affected boy. X-inactivation studies using a polymorphism in the 5'-flanking region of the HPRT gene, in conjunction with methylation-sensitive enzymes, revealed random X inactivation in the affected girl's leukocytes. In a muscle biopsy from the affected male, the dystrophin protein was present in normal amount and size. Family 3 was informative for four RFLPs detected with dystrophin cDNA probes which span the entire gene. The affected male was found to share the complete dystrophin RFLP haplotype with his unaffected brother, while his affected sister had inherited the other maternal haplotype. It is concluded that the clinical presentation of early-onset, progressive muscular dystrophy in a male and in his karyotypically normal sister can be caused by mutations at different loci. While in family 1 a deletion in the dystrophin gene is responsible, this gene does not appear to be involved in families 2 and 3.\r"

There appear to be two primary, opposite seasonal patterns of annual depression--winter depression and summer depression--with opposite vegetative symptoms. Seasonal affective disorder is not uncommon. It is important to identify patients with winter depression because they respond to a specific treatment, phototherapy.\r"

After 3 weeks, larvae were recovered to determine their viability, length, and stage of development. A significant reduction in parasite survival was observed in immunized mice. Furthermore, larvae recovered from immunized mice were significantly shorter than larvae recovered from control mice. All larvae recovered from immunized mice were L-3, whereas 96% of larvae recovered from controls were fourth-stage larvae (L-4). Sera collected from control and immunized mice were tested for the presence of antibodies reactive with L-3 and L-4 antigens using an indirect fluorescent antibody assay employing frozen larval cross-sections as antigen. Sera recovered after challenge of control mice reacted with internal, but not surface, antigens of L-3 and L-4. Alternatively, sera from immunized mice reacted with both internal and external antigens of both L-3 and L-4.\r"

Diagnosis was reached preoperatively in only 10 patients, probably due to the atypical clinical picture. In addition to a high degree of suspicion, careful examination of plain abdominal radiograph and ultrasonography are helpful in diagnosing adult intussusception. In 18 of 20 patients, an organic lesion causing intussusception was found. In six patients the cause was a malignancy. In such cases surgical treatment is necessary. In jejunojejunal and ileoileal intussusceptions, an attempt at primary reduction followed by resection or enterotomy is justified. In most cases of ileocolic, ileocecocolic, and colocolic intussusception, primary resection is the treatment of choice, especially in patients over 60 years old because of the high incidence of malignancy.\r"

Calculation of calf-brachial LDV indexes did not increase predictive accuracy compared to calf LDV measurements alone, although patients with wounds that failed to heal tended to have lower calf-brachial indexes. Preoperative noninvasive LDV may be used to aid in predicting the likelihood of successful healing after below-knee amputation.\r"

One hundred three patients underwent various types of hepatic resection with the aid of intraoperative ultrasonography. Forty-four tumors (43 percent) were embedded in the liver, and these tumors were not detected by conventional surgical exploration. The detectability rates were 38 percent for hepatocellular carcinomas smaller than 2 cm, 57 percent for 2 to 3.5 cm tumors, and 71 percent for 3.5 to 5 cm tumors. All undetectable hepatocellular carcinomas were identified by intraoperative echography. The overall detection rate by this method was 98 percent, which was substantially higher than the preoperative rate. Intraoperative ultrasonography is a useful and indispensable method for performing atypical minor hepatectomy for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas associated with liver cirrhosis.\r"

The identification of prognostic variables based on both clinical and histologic factors has allowed comparisons to be made between various therapeutic regimens. In extremity sarcoma, a more conservative operation utilizing adjuvant radiotherapy has decreased the need for radical surgery and maximized function without loss of survival benefit. The identification of high-risk groups, that is, patients with high-grade, large lesions, has highlighted the inadequacies of treatment in some areas. Similarly, this has led to more aggressive and innovative developmental programs. The progress, understanding, and therapeutic management of extremity lesions have not been matched in visceral and retroperitoneal tumors. Current efforts are directed at more appropriate use of radical surgery, maximizing conservative function-sparing operations with the use of adjuvant local therapy, and development of new regimens directed at prevention and treatment of metastatic disease.\r"

Reduced subjective symptoms and duration of attacks, together with improved cold test plethysmography, were significant only after ketanserin. All subjective symptom scores also improved after ketanserin but only for cyanosis and paresthesia after pentoxiphylline. Excellent results were obtained in 4 cases after ketanserin and in 1 case with pentoxiphylline.

After a washout phase of one week, the patients received in accordance with a randomization scheme either an i.v. infusion of 300 mg of pentoxifylline (15 mL ampoules) or 15 mL of a 0.9% NaCl solution in 250 mL of 5% laevulose, administered over three hours twice daily.

Baseline testing revealed a mean ICD of 131 m in the pentoxifylline group and 126 m in the placebo cohort; mean ACD values were 239 m and 225 m respectively. The group of patients treated with pentoxifylline (n = 75) displayed a significantly greater improvement (p less than 0.0001) in ICD (+70%) and ACD (+60%) than the placebo group did (+33%) and 32%, respectively) (n = 79).

  ".W": "To evaluate the circulatory response of the denervated heart to exercise, the authors studied 15 patients with an orthotopic transplanted heart (TH). Mean age was 48 +/- 10 (range twenty-five to sixty-two) years. All patients underwent a symptom-limited bicycle stress testing following a continuous protocol increasing the work load by 30 watts every three minutes. Exercise test was performed 16 +/- 9 months after operation. Fifteen healthy subjects matched for age were used as the control group. There were significant differences (p less than 0.01) in heart rate, at rest, peak exercise, and at five minutes of the recovery period, in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and in duration of exercise between TH patients and controls. Synchronization between recipient and donor sinoatrial nodes was observed in 10 of 15 patients. A case of silent myocardial ischemia was also observed in a patient with vasculitis and acute rejection. In conclusion, the lack of neural control in TH patients allows them to maintain a normal resting cardiac output but precludes attaining a normal maximum oxygen uptake, despite a normal contractile state. The high resting heart rate due to parasympathetic denervation constitutes an important limiting factor for an adequate chronotropic reserve. Functional capacity of transplanted patients is slightly impaired, but it does not preclude a good quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "A new monoclonal antibody specific for the beta-chain of human fibrin (C22A) and labeled with 111In has been obtained and successfully used in rabbits and dogs for the in vivo detection of venous thrombosis. Studies in humans are currently ongoing. In order to assess the diagnostic value of 111In-antifibrin for the detection of venous thrombosis of the lower extremities, the authors investigated 25 consecutive patients. Ten patients had clinical and instrumental (contrast phlebography and duplex scanning) evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), 3 had a long-standing DVT with relapsing episodes of swelling and pain, 5 had superficial venous thrombosis, and the remaining 7 had no signs of thrombosis at all. Twenty patients were being treated with heparin. All patients received 111In-antifibrin at the dose of 74 MBq IV and were scanned with a large field of view gamma camera coupled with a high-energy, parallel-hole collimator at 30 minutes and three, six, and twenty-four hours postinjection. Only the persistence of an abnormal uptake at twenty-four hours confirmed by two observers at visual inspection was considered as positive. A positive result was obtained in 9 of 10 DVT patients (90% sensitivity) and in all SVT patients. The single DVT patient with a negative 111In-antifibrin test had the longest interval between scintigraphy and onset of symptoms (fifty-five days). Thus, the age of thrombi represented a substantial limitation for the test. A false-positive result was obtained in a single SVT patient, in whom also a deep involvement, unconfirmed by phlebography, was suspected (91.6% specificity).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition to their direct effects on IgE synthesis, these lymphokines have other functions, many of which are related to IgE. IL-4 is not only a crucial signal for the induction of IgE synthesis, but also a growth factor for murine mast cells together with IL-3, a product of the same T cell clones. Furthermore, IL-4 is a potent inducer of Fc epsilon R2b expression on both B cells and monocytes. On the other hand, IL-4-secreting T cells also produce IL-5, which promotes B cell maturation and induces differentiation of eosinophil precursors. Eosinophils, in turn, express CD23 when activated; thus, the activation of the IgE system leads to increased IgE synthesis and to enhanced expression of Fc epsilon R1 (on mast cells) and Fc epsilon R2 (on B cells, monocytes, and eosinophils). This in turn results in increased receptor-ligand interactions, with release of different chemical mediators involved in the pathogenesis of allergy. Such considerations suggest that the regulation of IgE synthesis should be viewed in the wider context of the IgE system, a multi-component network in which different cell types are functionally integrated mainly through lymphokine-mediated signals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Daily variability of peak expiratory flow rate during fenoterol treatment was not different from that measured during placebo. Fenoterol syrup was associated with a statistically significant improvement in daytime symptom scores, whereas nighttime symptoms were not significantly reduced. Fenoterol significantly reduced the need for supplemental therapy. Adverse effects remained trivial and minimal for all children.

DESIGN: Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were cultured at the conclusion of primary therapy to assess the adequacy of treatment. SETTING: Outpatient clinics at three medical centers. PATIENTS: Patients had C. neoformans grown in culture from cerebrospinal fluid. Primary therapy consisted of either 2.0 g of amphotericin B alone; 6 weeks of combination therapy with flucytosine; or, if flucytosine was poorly tolerated, an adjusted minimum total amphotericin B dose. To meet criteria for adequate treatment of meningitis all patients had two sequential cerebrospinal fluid samples which were culture negative. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nine of forty-one patients grew C. neoformans from urine after completion of primary treatment, but none had urinary symptoms. Fungi were visualized in expressed prostatic secretions in 4 of these patients. One patient refused further treatment and developed cryptococcemia within 5 weeks. Three patients received additional amphotericin B; all had persistent funguria without systemic relapse. Six patients received fluconazole; 4 became urine culture negative, and 2 had systemic relapse. CONCLUSION: The persistence of urinary C. neoformans after adequate therapy for meningitis suggests that the urinary tract (probably the prostate) is a sequestered reservoir of infection from which systemic relapse may occur.\r"

We describe the clinical picture, stressing the need for biopsy to ensure correct diagnosis. It is especially important to recognize the treatment-resistant variant, inclusion body myositis. The extraskeletal manifestations, particularly the cardiopulmonary, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine involvement, are described. The cardiopulmonary involvement, especially interstitial lung disease, arrhythmias, and cardiac failure, may dominate the clinical picture. The known causes are varied, and include drugs, toxins, and some infectious agents, however, in most cases a cause cannot yet be identified. Circumstantial evidence suggests that picornaviruses may initiate some cases in humans, and a very similar disease in mice caused by a picornavirus is actively under study. Studies of autoantibodies and cellular immune function support a central role for disordered immunity in the pathogenesis. The myositis-specific autoantibodies, especially those directed at certain enzymes important in protein synthesis (the aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases), are found in a clinically distinct subset of patients. Although most patients respond initially to corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs are sometimes added when steroid toxicity or refractoriness develops. We describe several newer therapies under study for such cases and outline future directions in research.\r"

Psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis with opportunistic agents, as well as an articular pain that is severe, acute, and intermittent, may also occur with HIV infection. An arthritis that may be specific for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been described. Myopathies, especially of a polymyositic type, vasculitis, and the sicca syndrome are also part of the spectrum of rheumatologic presentation of HIV infection. Several autoimmune phenomena, such as antinuclear and anticardiolipin antibodies, as well as lupus anticoagulant, have been reported in HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Reiter syndrome, reactive arthritis, polymyositis, and the sicca syndrome may herald the onset of clinically evident HIV infection. These diseases and others may also occur in patients with full-blown AIDS. Furthermore, HIV infection may mimic systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical ecologists propose the existence of a unique illness in which multiple environmental chemicals, foods, drugs, and endogenous C. albicans have a toxic effect on the immune system, thereby adversely affecting other bodily functions. The proposal uses some concepts that superficially resemble those that apply to clinical allergy and toxicology and others that are novel. Review of the clinical ecology literature provides inadequate support for the beliefs and practices of clinical ecology. The existence of an environmental illness as presented in clinical ecology theory must be questioned because of the lack of a clinical definition. Diagnoses and treatments involve procedures of no proven efficacy. Case reports by clinical ecologists and evaluation of these patients by other physicians indicate that this diagnosis is applied most frequently to persons with symptoms of physiologic (somatic) or psychologic dysfunction, or both. Proof of cause-effect relations between environmental factors and symptoms of \"environmental illness\" is particularly difficult because clinical ecologists implicate such a broad range of agents, including chemicals, foods, hormones, and microorganisms. Most patients are believed to react to multiple environmental substances by any route of exposure, and some are said to be intolerant to the entire environment, the so-called \"total allergy syndrome.\" The principal method of proof cited by clinical ecologists for the existence of \"environmental illness\" is the symptom-provocation test used in diagnosis of individual cases after the condition is suspected because of a history of symptoms and suspected causes. Published studies on the provocation test employed widely different subject-selection methods and outcome-measurement criteria. All were seriously flawed by the absence of matched patient-control groups, absence or inadequacy of the placebo, and failure to achieve or document randomness of trials. Not surprisingly, therefore, the conclusions from these studies are conflicting. Those studies reporting results of immunologic tests are insufficient to address theories of environmental illness; the number of cases is small and selection criteria are not clear. Enumeration of lymphocyte subsets and quantitation of serum immunoglobulin and complement levels in patients with \"environmental illness\" have not yielded clear-cut evidence of immunologic abnormality. Clinical ecologists use a treatment program that includes avoidance of environmental chemicals, rotation of foods in the diet, and neutralization of symptoms with injected or sublingual extracts. Except for small-dose oral nystatin, which is used for treatment of patients with the candida hypersensitivity syndrome, drug therapy is intentionally avoided, although some clinical ecologists recommend mineral salts, oxygen, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants for relief of symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The trimolecular complex controls antigen-specific T-cell activation in normal and abnormal immune reactions. Recent progress in myasthenia gravis (MG) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) exemplifies this, leading to the following conclusions: (1) Autoimmune T cells may act by interfering with immunoregulation (as in MG) or by directly mediating autoimmune damage (as in EAE), or both. (2) In both diseases, the autoimmune T cells are clonally heterogeneous but recognize only a limited number of epitopes on the autoantigen (acetylcholine receptor in MG; myelin basic protein in EAE). Many of these epitopes can be defined as short peptide fragments of antigen, bound to a particular type of MHC molecule. (3) The MHC determines which peptides are recognized by autoimmune T cells in a given patient or inbred animal strain. (4) The discovery of the limited repertoire of autoimmune T cells has allowed considerable progress in the immunotherapy of EAE, using either monoclonal antibodies or cytotoxic T cells directed against clonotypic determinants on the autoaggressive T cells. (5) One obstacle to this approach in human disease is the polymorphism of the MHC in the species and the commensurate heterogeneity of autoimmune T cells.\r"

Vacuolar myelopathy was seen in 8 of 26 spinal cords (31%) and microglial nodules were seen in 13 (50%). All of the patients with lateral column vacuolar myelopathy showed severe brain pathology. HIV antigens had been detected in the brains of 15 (55%) of the 27 patients but were detected in only 3 (11%) of 26 spinal cords and were not localized to regions of vacuolar myelopathy. This suggests that the vacuolar myelopathy may be due to a remote or indirect effect of HIV or other infectious agent. CMV antigens were detected in none of the patients who showed vacuolar myelopathy but were detected in 2 of the 13 with microglial nodules. Focal nerve root or peripheral nerve inflammation was seen in 7 patients; 4 had CMV antigens and none had HIV antigens. CMV appears to be an important cause of inflammatory peripheral neuropathy in AIDS patients.\r"

Blister fluids from patients with PV and BP showed interleukin 1 (IL-1)- and interleukin 2 (IL-2)-like activity and contained prostaglandin (PG) E2, F1 alpha, and F2 alpha, thromboxane B2 (TB2), leukotriene (LT) B4 and C4, serine esterases, and proteolysis inhibitors. Pemphigus blister fluid was distinguished by high IL-1-like activity, proteolytic activity, and high concentrations of TB2 and LTB4, while pemphigoid blister fluid was characterized by higher IL-2-like activity, antiprotease activity, and high PGE2 concentration. We also determined that the content of mediators of inflammation varied depending on the duration of blister development. In both PV and BP, the initially high IL-1-like activity, amount of serine proteases, and concentrations of PGF2 alpha, TB2, LTB4, and LTC4 decreased by the fifth day of blister existence, whereas antiprotease activity as well as PGE2 and PGF1 alpha concentrations gradually increased as blisters developed. These findings suggest certain differences in the character of the bullous inflammatory process in pemphigus and pemphigoid.\r"

Recently, two patients were described with an autosomal recessive form of EB simplex associated with muscular dystrophy. We now describe four additional patients with autosomal recessive EB simplex, three of whom had associated muscular dystrophy or congenital myasthenia gravis. These patients had generalized cutaneous findings, including milia, atrophic scarring, nail dystrophy, and scalp alopecia, which have been classically attributed to either junctional or dystrophic EB. Each patient had significant oral cavity involvement, and in two, marked growth retardation and anemia were also present. Our findings suggest that autosomal recessive EB simplex may be characterized by rather severe cutaneous and extracutaneous disease activity, and may be associated with at least two distinct neuromuscular diseases.\r"

A diagnosis was made in each case by histopathological studies and cultures of skin biopsy specimens. The fungal organisms cultured were Aspergillus species in three patients and Rhizopus species in two patients. All patients were treated with amphotericin B. Three patients responded to antifungal therapy and local care without surgical debridgement. Two patients died of disseminated fungal infection. The development of cutaneous lesions due to opportunistic fungal pathogens seemed to have been related to the moist and humid conditions created by occlusive dressings or excessive perspiration.\r"

All 14 patients had acutely inflamed gallbladders; 6 (42.8%) had areas of necrosis or gangrene. The mortality rate was 7% (1 patient). While the percentage of patients receiving prolonged intensive care (100%), narcotic analgesics (100%), and TPN (93%) correlates with the experience cited previously, the percentage undergoing preoperative diagnostic imaging is unusually high, reflecting a heightened suspicion for AAC. Computed tomographic or sonographic evidence of gallbladder wall thickness greater than or equal to 4 mm, pericholecystic fluid or subserosal edema without ascites, intramural gas, or a sloughed mucosal membrane was considered diagnostic criteria for AAC. We conclude that preoperative computed tomogram or ultrasound imaging leads to earlier recognition of this life-threatening problem.\r"

The hemodynamic and electrophysiologic properties of these agents suggest that their use would be appropriate in both the immediate and the long-term management of patients who suffered a myocardial infarction. Some experimental evidence accumulated from animal models supports the ability of these drugs to reduce both myocardial infarct size and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. The clinical trials with these drugs, however, have yielded disappointing results. Some data suggest a role of diltiazem therapy in reducing the incidence of transmural wall infarction and angina in those patients sustaining non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. In the setting of Q-wave infarction, calcium channel blockers seem to be less effective than beta-blockade both for acute and long-term management. Finally, calcium channel blockers appear to be contraindicated in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction and who have concomitant left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Forty-seven of these transplants were performed simultaneously with kidney transplants from the same donor; 23 followed previous kidney transplants, and 5 were preuremic pancreas-only transplants. The 1-year patient survival rate is 85% and pancreas graft survival rate is 54%. The simultaneous kidney and pancrease group had a 1-year patient survival rate of 82%, a pancreas graft survival rate of 59%, and a renal graft survival rate of 73%. Thirty-one of 70 kidney and pancreas recipients had a functioning pancreas 1 year post transplantation and 26 of 31 currently have a functioning pancreas and are insulin free. Patient symptoms of neuropathy and gastroenteropathy are improved with long-term graft function. Some patients may develop type II diabetes post transplantation with impaired glucose tolerance despite high insulin production by the graft. Pancreas transplantation is the only therapy that achieves a euglycemic state as indicated by glycosylated hemoglobin and glucose tolerance testing. Centers must continue to follow up patients on a long-term basis to determine the final effects on the secondary complications of diabetes.\r"

Recurrent stenosis was identified in 35/124 (28.1%), and an occluded vessel was identified in 2/124 (1.6%). Of the total recurrent stenosis group, recurrent stenosis was graded mild in 22/124 (17.7%), moderate in 7/124 (5.6%), and severe in 6/124 (4.8%). Of the 35 vessels with recurrent stenosis by duplex scanning, 22/35 (62.8%) were in female patients, and 13/35 (37.2%) were in male patients. Of the vessels with severe recurrent stenosis, 5/6 (83%) were in female patients. Recurrent stenosis following carotid endarterectomy is more common than appreciated clinically, and female patients in particular may be more prone to recurrent stenosis.\r"

Currently, the dementias are classified according to clinicopathologic entities, although for clinical diagnosis, this introduces a degree of uncertainty. Characteristic patterns of behavior and anatomic pathology have been associated with specific clinicopathologic entities. Although somewhat simplistic, classification of the dementias as cortical vs subcortical embodies the precept that brain substrate is intimately tied to behavior. Lessons in brain-behavior relationships are reviewed for four clinicopathologic entities: Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, vascular dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Dementing illnesses have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain-behavior relationships. Major progress can be anticipated as diagnostic issues are resolved and biological and state-specific markers emerge.\r"

Current evidence suggests that injury during the intrapartum period is uncommon. The most widely used technique for antenatal surveillance is fetal heart rate monitoring. Fetal heart rate abnormalities, however, are infrequently associated with long-term adverse outcomes. Fetuses may manifest many minutes of \"ominous\" fetal heart rate patterns without evidence of irreversible central nervous system injury. Neurologically abnormal fetuses also may manifest abnormal fetal heart rate patterns because of neural mechanisms controlling heart rate, rather than because of intrapartum hypoxic events. Fetal acidosis also correlates poorly with outcome. The conclusion that a child's neurologic abnormalities are due to brain injury occurring during the intrapartum period cannot be based on fetal surveillance findings in isolation, but must be based on the consideration of many parameters.\r"

Granulocytic sarcomas (chloromas) rarely involve the nervous system in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, although with increased survival it is apparent that the incidence may be greater than previously believed. Central nervous system prophylaxis was not administered to our patient but may be recommended for future patients if systemic disease can be controlled. General features of central nervous system complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, characteristics of granulocytic sarcoma, and review of current radiographic techniques used in the evaluation of these tumors are discussed.\r"

The post-operative course was uneventful until the sixth day of life when progressive enlargement of the head with progressive ventricular dilatation was recognized.

A total of 106 probands (82 males, 24 females) with a mean age of 70 years fulfilled the criteria for DISH as defined previously. One hundred and seventy-eight patients (117 males, 61 females) not meeting these criteria were used as controls. The prevalence of back pain was assessed by a blinded interviewer using a structured questionnaire. Our primary hypothesis was that spinal DISH positive probands had not had back pain more often than controls. This controlled study showed no statistically significant difference in pain frequency between spinal DISH positive probands and controls at any spinal level. We conclude that back pain does not occur more often in radiographically defined DISH positive probands than in controls. The radiological finding of spinal DISH, as far as it does not lead to stenosis of the spinal canal or dysphagia, thus seems to be a finding without clinical relevance.\r"

The conditioning regimen consisted of hyperfractionated total-body irradiation (TBI) and high-dose cyclophosphamide or the cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposid (CBV) regimen. In all of the female patients, we observed primary ovarian failure requiring estradiol replacement therapy. In all of the male patients, testosterone levels were normal but follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were increased, suggestive of germinal aplasia which was proved by semen analysis in several patients. In contrast to the reports of other groups, we did not find any abnormalities in thyroid function, most likely because TBI was hyperfractionated. Moderate toxicity to the adrenal cortex was noticed and was more pronounced in women than in men. Our results are similar to findings reported after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, with the exception of normal thyroid function in our patients. These results should be taken into consideration when counseling patients about the long-term consequences of myeloablative treatment. Cryopreservation of semen should be offered to men before myeloablative treatment. Estrogen replacement should be initiated after transplantation in women to prevent adverse effects of long-term ovarian failure.\r"

We report two of five patients with the longest recorded follow-up times in the literature who are alive with no evidence of disease at 4 and 6 years. Contrary to the belief that SCC of the bladder is an aggressive, rapidly disseminating tumor similar to SCC of the lung, our findings support the notion that this is a potentially curable neoplasm with a prognosis that appears to be dependent on stage and surgical resectability.\r"

No ITGCN was observed in infant testes with teratomas or adult testes with epidermoid cysts; all of the neoplasms in the latter two groups behaved as benign tumors. ITGCN is associated with malignant potential (P = 0.0004; Fisher's exact test). These tumors comprise a spectrum of clinicopathologic entities that probably reflect differences in pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Ten male patients with extensive primary endodermal sinus tumor of the mediastinum were treated with chemotherapy (with or without surgical excision and radiation therapy) between 1977 and 1985. Three patients, treated with cyclophosphamide-vincristine-based chemotherapy, died 1.5, 2.5, and 6.0 months, respectively, after initial diagnosis. Of the seven patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, one patient died of septicemia at 2.5 months after diagnosis and was disease-free at autopsy examination. Three other patients died of progressive disease at 7.0, 13.0, and 14.0 months, respectively. The three survivors remain alive at 17.0, 31.0, and 40.0 months from diagnosis; all are without evidence of disease. Of the three patients who underwent excision of the residual mediastinal tumor after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, persistent local disease was found in two patients. One of these two patients died of recurrent disease. All surviving patients had surgical resection of the tumor either before or after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy and the timing of therapeutic interventions was guided by changes in the serum alpha-fetoprotein concentrations after initial therapy and during follow-up. Our experience suggests that the optimal management of patients with primary mediastinal endodermal sinus tumor requires an aggressive multidisciplinary approach guided by the extent of the tumor and the serum tumor marker levels.\r"

The tumor fulfilled established criteria for determining origin in the rete and showed an unusual biphasic morphology with papillary adenocarcinoma mixed with a prominent component of cytologically malignant spindle cells. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated a positive reaction in the epithelium for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen, and the cytoplasm of a few of the spindle cells also reacted with these antibodies. Electron microscopic study confirmed the biphasic pattern, showing epithelial gland formation and mesenchymal cells. The results indicate that this tumor is a metaplastic carcinoma of the rete testis. Recognition of this pattern of rete carcinoma may further enhance our knowledge of primary tumors at this unusual site.\r"

Most metastases were in the lung. Although the biologic behavior of ameloblastomas cannot be predicted on the basis of morphology, metastasis appears to follow multiple recurrences. Early adequate resection of the primary to avoid repeated surgical procedures is advocated to prevent tumor spread. Surgical removal is preferred for treating metastasis. Although the response to radiation cannot be predicted, radiation should be used to treat lesions not amenable to surgical removal. Disseminated ameloblastoma does not appear to respond to chemotherapy.\r"

However, BLEO-related pulmonary nodules have been reported recently, mostly in children and young adults treated for germ cell tumors. A different, apparent hypersensitivity reaction with prominent eosinophilic infiltrates has been seen in other patients. This report details the clinical history, radiographic features, and histopathologic condition of three patients with osteogenic sarcoma in whom pulmonary nodules developed during the course of their multiagent, BLEO-containing chemotherapy. The predominant histopathologic lesion was bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP); one patient had a significant eosinophilic infiltrate also. Pulmonary lesions developed in all of these patients after relatively low doses of BLEO (less than 200 mg). All of these patients underwent open lung biopsy to establish the diagnosis. Reported cases of BLEO-induced pulmonary injury other than diffuse fibrosis are reviewed and comparisons are made with those in the current report. Also, suggestions are made for the management of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Human fetal tissues were studied for presence of immunoreactive Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) and Tn epitopes (EPs) using well-defined anti-T and anti-Tn rodent monoclonal antibodies. T and Tn are universal (pan) carcinoma (CA) markers that are occluded in normal postfetal tissues except in some immunoprivileged enclaves. Immunohistochemical methods using avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase for staining were employed. Tissues between 45 and 117 days after ovulation were studied. In most instances, anti-T and anti-Tn antibodies showed similar immunoreactivity as demonstrated by positive immunohistochemical staining. The most intense staining was in epithelial and mesothelial components; the mesenchyme stained more faintly. All human sera have anti-T and anti-Tn antibodies, stimulated largely by intestinal flora. The presence of immunoreactive T and Tn during an early phase of fetal development, as shown here, and their known absence in noncarcinomatous postfetal tissues suggests that T and Tn, in addition to their association with CA, are stage-specific oncofetal antigens in pretolerogenic differentiation phases.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution and localization of acid stable trypsin inhibitor (ASTI) in normal and malignant human tissues from various organs were examined using immunohistochemical techniques that used goat antibody raised against highly purified ASTI from human urine. Tissues were assessed as positive only when they were stained by both the biotin-avidin-peroxidase complex system and biotin-streptavidin-beta-galactosidase complex system, and the staining was abolished by absorption with purified ASTI. Under normal conditions, ASTI immunoreactivity was observed in only a few organs. Positive tissues for ASTI immunoreactivity included the kidney proximal tubules, glial cells of the cerebrum, fibrillar structures of the lamina propria of the stomach and colon, and bronchial epithelial cells. No ASTI immunoreactivity was observed in the cardiovascular system, reproductive system, or other tissues examined. As is not the case for normal tissues, ASTI immunoreactivity was found to be widely distributed in malignant tumors. Staining was observed in the extracellular space, i.e., in the stroma of the tumor and in connective tissues around the tumor invasion, whereas no ASTI immunoreactivity was detected in the malignant cells. Considering the identity of the first 36 NH2-terminal residues of ASTI purified from plasma or urine with a recently reported endothelial cell growth factor, the present findings suggest that ASTI could play an important role, not limited to its function as a protease inhibitor, in the invasive growth of malignant neoplasms.\r"

Ultrasound (n = 15) showed the number and distribution of the hemangiomas within the liver. Hypoechoic and hyperechoic elements were present in addition to prominent vascular channels and diminished caliber of the distal aorta. Radionuclide sulfur colloid (n = 12) and labeled red blood cell (n = 7) studies showed the distribution and vascularity of the hemangiomas. Computed tomography (n = 8) revealed central hypointensity with marked peripheral enhancement after contrast. Arteriography now performed only as a prelude to therapeutic embolization demonstrated hypervascularity in each patient, contrast pooling in six and early draining veins in five. Magnetic resonance scanning (n = 3) showed decreased signal intensity on T1 images and high intensity signal on T2. In two patients, there was resolution or improvement of the hemangiomas without therapy. Four patients had surgery (lobectomy [2], trisegmentectomy [1], and surgical evacuation of a central hematoma [1]). Steroids and radiation were given to seven patients, and one patient also required therapeutic embolization. Steroids were the initial therapy in five patients, one of whom later required therapeutic embolization and another cyclophosphamide. Two patients were treated initially with radiation therapy, one of whom also needed emergency hepatic artery ligation. Seventeen of the 20 patients are alive and well from 6 months to 14 years after diagnosis.\r"

As a result there are more individuals who are at risk for the development of acute respiratory emergencies associated with sports and athletics. EIB is a common feature of asthma and is characterized by a postexercise fall in FEV1 of more than 10 per cent. Although a variety of medications have been used for the prevention of EIB, cromolyn sodium and inhaled adrenergic agonists have been shown to be the most effective. EIA and cholinergic urticaria are two physical allergies in which hypotension can be brought on by exercise. In some individuals, EIA develops only in association with the ingestion of a particular food. Associated with sports and recreational activities in alpine areas is the risk of developing acute high-altitude medical problems. One of the most dramatic and potentially life threatening is high-altitude pulmonary edema. The management of this condition can be problematic, particularly if rapid descent to lower elevations is not possible. Although rare, spontaneous pneumothorax and pulmonary emboli do develop in the otherwise well-conditioned athlete. These entities must be considered when the physician evaluates any athlete in whom acute cough and dyspnea develop.\r"

In young asymptomatic individuals, the prevalence of congenital heart disease is estimated at 0.5 per cent. Perhaps 1 per cent of these athletes has congenital lesions that could potentially result in sudden death and of these, only 10 per cent will, indeed, die suddenly. Identification of a group of 1000 athletes who have congenital cardiovascular disease of whom perhaps only one will die suddenly requires screening of 200,000 competitors. It is rather unlikely that any community would consider this type of undertaking economically feasible, especially considering that the most useful test for the younger age group, the echocardiogram, is also one of the most expensive. Noninvasive screening on an individual basis, in most instances, will identify those athletes at risk for sudden death if appropriate financial resources can be applied. History and physical examination, chest roentgenogram, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and exercise stress testing are useful tools in the recognition of those conditions associated with acute cardiac emergencies.\r"

  ".W": "Athletes who sustain a direct blow to the abdomen that results in injury to spleen, liver, or kidney may have immediate severe pain and may become \"shocky\" quickly. Trainers, EMTs, paramedics, and team physicians should be aware of this possibility. In addition, athletes who have sustained direct blow and have had slower bleeding may collapse later either on the field, on the side-lines, or at home. They will be pale, sweaty, may complain of thirst, and the pulse will be rapid and thready. If a blow has been sustained that results in abdominal pain, the athlete should not be given liquids to drink. If he has collapsed or has diffuse abdominal pain he should be kept in a recumbent position, and the legs should be elevated in order to assist blood in returning to the heart (Trendelenberg position). If hypotensive shock is present, the PASG antishock garment should be applied. In cases in which there is serious concern about an intra-abdominal injury or the patient has collapsed in shock, transport to a hospital, preferably to a trauma center, should be effected as rapidly as possible. There should not be excessive delays in starting intravenous fluids or administering time-consuming procedures in the field. Truly serious intra-abdominal injuries as a result of nonvehicular sports-related incidents are not common. It is precisely for this reason that they are dangerous. Teammates, parents, trainers, coaches, EMTs, and paramedics are not accustomed to seeing them with any frequency. Because of this, the early signs of injury are often unrecognized, even in cases that progress to shock or collapse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Salivary stones were demonstrated by this method and ultrasound allowed assessment of periglandular structures. Sialography is indispensable for detailed assessment of the salivary ducts. The present report shows that ultrasound is superior to sialography in the assessment of salivary gland disease. The investigation is non-invasive, cheap, and requires neither contrast nor radiation and can be repeated at will for follow-up.\r"

We await further studies to define the ultimate roles for relaxin and synthetic laminaria. Whether the addition of oral tocolytics to PGE2 will overcome the uterine hyperstimulation complications without reducing its effectiveness remains unanswered. For the present, however, only PGE2 has been clearly shown to improve perinatal outcome in prolonged pregnancy, and its use is an alternative to antepartum surveillance when the cervical status is unfavorable. One final word of caution would seem prudent at this time. Informed consent should be strongly considered prior to employing any of the cervical priming techniques described. Involving the patient in this process should improve communication and understanding between doctor and patient, which ultimately leads to better care.\r"

Cesarean delivery rates will be significantly increased if an amniotomy is performed in the woman with an unfavorable cervix. Accordingly, we advocate sequential induction of the postdate pregnancy in the absence of other maternal or fetal mandates for imminent delivery. A host of oxytocin induction protocols exist and are acceptable, as are guidelines for what constitutes an adequate labor pattern. Although an increasing number of agents are available for cervical ripening, for the foreseeable future dilute intravenous oxytocin will remain the labor induction agent of choice.\r"

MRI is an excellent method to evaluate bone marrow involvement and soft-tissue extension of osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. In children, it is important to be aware of the changes in normal bone marrow signal that occur with maturation and with the normal progression of the replacement of red marrow by yellow marrow. Aplastic and hypercellular anemias have differing MRI features. The high-contrast resolution of the soft tissues, including the spinal cord, and the capability for direct imaging in any plane make MRI an excellent modality for the evaluation of the spine, including congenital malformations.\r"

Even though it was first described in 1830, it is a rare disease usually affecting children, but infrequent adult cases do occur. Patients generally seek treatment for progressive unrelenting throat and neck pain followed by torticollis and subluxation. Neurologic complications occur in approximately 15% of cases and can range from radiculopathy to myelopathy and even death. Principles of management include bacteriologic cure and correction of bony deformity and neurologic protection. The authors present two adult patients with Grisel's syndrome. The first illustrates the permanent spinal deformity that can occur if the disease remains unrecognized for a prolonged period of time. The second case demonstrates a delayed neurologic complication in an adult who had Grisel's syndrome in childhood. It is hoped that these two examples, together with a detailed discussion of the literature, will inform physicians of an unusual but important condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient complaining of neck pain.\r"

For example, the excellent depiction of bone marrow makes it a very sensitive method for identifying trauma, tumor, ischemia and infection of the marrow space. In addition, the high-contrast discrimination of soft tissues and the ability to make thin-section images in any plane allows for the depiction of abnormalities involving the muscles, ligaments, tendons, and neurovascular structures. The major disadvantages are the nonspecificity of many of the findings, the high cost of examinations, and the limited number of available MRI units. MRI is most appropriately utilized when it can be expected to provide diagnostic information not available from less-expensive noninvasive diagnostic methods and when the results of the examination may significantly affect patient management. To get the most out of the examination, it should be performed and interpreted with knowledge of clinical findings and results of other imaging tests, especially plain roentgenograms. To date, MRI has proved to be most useful for the evaluation of the spine, shoulder, hip, and knee.\r"

Despite elevated pressures in the muscle compartments of the right arm, surgical decompression was delayed until a complete blood coagulation profile was obtained. After replacement of deficient blood products, the compartment syndrome resolved without surgical decompression. Defective coagulation leading to hemorrhage into the muscle compartments of the arm resulted in a significant elevation of compartmental pressure. The unusual clinical presentation of the patient, as well as a lack of a positive family history, delayed the diagnosis of hemophilia and the subsequent replacement therapy.\r"

The clinical score was assessed by the hip rating score of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association, which assigns a maximum of 100 points. The preoperative clinical score ranged from 22 to 59 points (mean, 42.6). The postoperative score improved to a range of 65-92 points (mean, 72.8). Of 24 hips examined, 21 (87.5%) were painless. As measured serially from the roentgenograms made immediately after the operation, the overall distance of central migration in 24 hips was 0-8.5 mm (average, 2.7 mm). The overall distance of superior migration in 24 hips was 0-10 mm (average, 3.7 mm).

When evaluating for shoulder pathology, the choice of imaging plane and pulse sequencing will be determined by the suspected pathology. In patients with impingement syndrome, subacromial bursitis, supraspinatus tendinitis, and supraspinatus tendon tear can be differentiated, and the offending component of the subacromial are traumatizing these soft tissues can be identified. MRI is also useful in determining the extent of retraction of the supraspinatus musculotendinous junction and the amount of muscle atrophy in cases of massive, chronic tears. Labral tear or attenuation due to glenohumeral instability can be imaged without the injection of contrast material, and MRI can identify those patients with multidirectional instability. Because of the ability to directly depict bone marrow, MRI is the imaging method of choice for the evaluation of early ischemic necrosis of the humeral head.\r"

Because of its abundance in the human body, hydrogen is used for clinical MRI. Within the MR magnet, the atoms are aligned with the magnetic field. The MR signal is generated by subjecting the atoms to radiofrequency (RF) pulsations, and the pulse sequences selected will determine the appearance of the image. The repitition time (TR) is the time between the RF pulses, and the echo time (TE) is the time between the RF pulse and the recording of the signal. T1-weighted images (short TR/short TE) provide the best anatomic detail, but T2-weighted images (long TR/long TE) are often needed to demonstrate pathology. Many unfamiliar artifacts may be encountered on MR images. These can be due to several factors, including inhomogeneities in the magnetic field (for example, those resulting from metallic orthopedic applicances or prior surgery), extraneous RF interference, and motion. Surface coils are commonly used in musculoskeletal MR imaging to improve the quality of the examination by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio over the area of interest.\r"

  ".W": "The role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of the spine is expanding rapidly. In addition to being noninvasive, MRI offers high soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capability. MRI examinations of the spine usually include a T1-weighted spin-echo and a T2-weighted spin-echo and/or a gradient-echo sequence. As in other parts of the body, the use of surface coils results in higher-quality examinations. Various methods are employed to reduce the motion artifacts that are particularly troublesome in spine imaging. Paramagnetic contrast agents are used to enhance soft-tissue lesions. The contrast sensitivity of MRI provides a unique means to assess the intervertebral disc, and MRI is rapidly becoming the method of choice for evaluation of disc disease. It is also very sensitive and accurate in the detection of osteomyelitis of the spine. MRI has improved the evaluation of failed back surgery syndrome, and the administration of gadolinium-diethylene trimene pentacidic acid helps to differentiate postsurgical scar from recurrent disc herniation. MRI is an unparalleled tool for the detection and evaluation of intramedullary lesions including syringomyelia, gliomas, hematomas, and lesions associated with dysraphism. It is also useful in many extramedullary intradural processes. In summary, MRI is the best first examination for spinal disease.\r"

Advances in newborn care and in surgical techniques, and an improved ability to both detect and treat hydrocephalus and CSF infections, have resulted in better outcomes for these children. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of myelomeningocele suggest that prevention of most of these congenital malformations may be possible through periconceptual vitamin supplementation.\r"

  ".W": "Aging is a multi-facetted process, but the deterioration of the immune function seems to play a central role in this context. Paradoxically, immune reactivity against exogenous antigens declines during aging while autoimmune reactivity increases. One of the aims of our investigations on the function of the senescent immune system was to define immune parameters of 'normal' aging, i.e. those not dependent on underlying diseases. Specifically, our interest was focused on the possible role of an altered lipid metabolism of cells of the immune system during aging. The known decrease of plasma membrane fluidity of lymphoid cells and monocytes in higher age may be one of the factors responsible for the nonoptimal functioning of the immune system. This property, in turn, seems to be based on an altered lipid metabolism. Specifically, we have evidence that the finely tuned balance between the transport of cholesterol to and from lymphoid cells via the environment and the intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis seems to be disturbed with increasing age. This conclusion is drawn from experiments where low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor activity is assessed using fluorescently labeled lipoproteins in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analyses. LDL receptor uptake is unexpectedly increased in the elderly, but LDL receptor regulation, and serum LDL composition itself seem to be normal. Preliminary data point out the possibility that the efflux of cholesterol via HDL may be insufficient. Attempts to modulate plasma membrane fluidity by means of the phospholipid mixture 'active lipid 721' (AL 721) showed that this drug, in contrast to literature reports, is not a 'membrane fluidizer' but rather exerts this effect as a nutrient for lymphocytes and monocytes.\r"

SALT is comprised of (a) potent antigen presenting cells (LC); (b) distinctive populations of T lymphocytes some of which preferentially infiltrate the epidermis; (c) keratinocytes which produce several immunomodulatory cytokines, and (d) a set of draining peripheral lymph nodes that contain, along with the dermis, blood vessels with endothelial cells whose surface capture lymphocytes passing through the blood. An increasingly better understanding of the circuits and signals of SALT will hopefully result in the development of strategies to prevent a breakdown of this important host-defense mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "HIV has several characteristics that make it difficult to combat; namely its ability to integrate into the host genome, its tendency to mutate, and its ability to infect at least one organ (the brain) with limited regenerative potential. Although these features of HIV make it quite unlikely that a curative therapy for HIV-induced diseases will be found in the near future, it is very encouraging that, in the brief period since HIV was identified as the etiological agent of AIDS, a variety of drugs have been shown to possess anti-retroviral activity. At least one of them (AZT) has already been proven to decrease morbidity and to prolong survival in ARC/AIDS patients. While several single agents with anti-HIV activity in vitro are now being tested for a beneficial clinical effect in HIV-infected patients, it is likely that combination drug therapy will ultimately be more effective in these patients than one drug alone. Such a combination therapy may allow interference with two or even more stages of the HIV life cycle, may lessen the chance of mutation-induced resistance, and may permit additive antiviral activity without additive toxicity of the drugs.\r"

Computed tomographic scanning is now the mainstay of diagnosis for hepatic injuries after blunt trauma and allows for nonoperative therapy in many patients with lacerations, intrahepatic hematomas, or subcapsular hematomas; 2. Realization that the time limit for application of the Pringle maneuver can be extended. 3. Recognition that fibrin glue appears to be a useful topical agent in preliminary clinical studies; 4. Use of hepatotomy with selective vascular ligation instead of mattress sutures for deep lacerations or to control hemorrhage from tracts of penetrating wounds; 5. Use of resectional debridement of devitalized tissue and selective vascular ligation instead of formal anatomical resection; 6. Use of an \"omental pack\" as a filler of deep cracks or hepatotomy sites instead of closure with mattress sutures; 7. Use of perihepatic packing in selected patients instead of resection when a coagulopathy or major subcapsular hematoma is present; 8. Discontinued use of perihepatic drains for minor or moderate hepatic injuries as long as discrete methods of selective vascular and biliary ligation have been used.\r"

A Medstone STS lithotripter was used together with ursodiol. Two hundred twenty-three patients were treated under general anesthesia (75%) or with intravenous analgesia (25%). Initial treatments were on an inpatient basis, but as centers gained experience, outpatient treatments became more common. Stone fragmentation and clearance were greatest in patients with solitary gallstones less than 2 cm in diameter. In this group of patients, stone fragmentation occurred in 97% of patients, and the cumulative stone-free rates at three and six months were 54% and 90%, respectively. These results indicate that fragmentation of gallstones can be achieved by a dry shock-wave lithotripter and that stone clearance is induced more rapidly by external shock-wave lithotripsy and adjuvant ursodiol therapy than by ursodiol therapy alone.\r"

Cytology was thus the only positive test in 26 cases with Candida albicans (47% of the 55 cases), in 11 cases of Campylobacter pylori (20%), and in nine cases of Giardia lamblia (29%).

One hundred ninety-five patients with endoscopically documented gastric ulcer disease were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to treatment with either famotidine 40 mg at bedtime or ranitidine 150 mg twice a day. Healing rates were similar in both groups: at four weeks 49% vs 48%, at six weeks 71% vs 69%, and at eight weeks 83% vs 81% for famotidine and for ranitidine, respectively. Pain relief, antacid tablet use, and adverse experiences were also similar in the two groups. Only 25% of patients entered in the gastric ulcer registry were enrolled in the trial. Given that patients with more severe or complicated gastric ulcer disease should be excluded from controlled trials of new drugs, the screening criteria used in the present study be excluded from findings being representative of a quarter of the patients seen in these practices. Therefore, coupling a patient registry with a clinical trial helps determine the applicability of its results. Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime is an effective and well-tolerated treatment of acute, benign gastric ulcer disease and is comparable in efficacy and safety to ranitidine 150 mg twice a day.\r"

VIP receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase are present on epithelial, smooth muscle, and mononuclear cells. This study analyzes the distribution of [125I]VIP binding and [125I]substance P in human colon and small intestine using autoradiographic techniques. [125I]VIP binding was present in high density in the mucosal layer of colon and small intestine. [125I]VIP binding was not significantly greater than nonspecific binding in smooth muscle layers or the lymphoid follicles. In contrast, [125I]substance P binding was present in high density over the colonic muscle but was not present over the mucosal layer. In human colon cancer, [125I]VIP grain density over the malignant tissue was only slightly higher than background. These autoradiographic studies of [125I]VIP binding indicate that the highest density of VIP receptors was found in the small intestine and superficial colonic mucosa, whereas the density of substance P receptors was highest over the smooth muscle layers. These findings suggest a mismatch between immunochemical content of the peptide and autoradiographic density of the receptor.\r"

  ".U": "89305173\r", 
  ".W": "Obesity, defined as an excess of body fat, can be measured with a variety of techniques, but in most epidemiologic studies it is estimated from height and weight or from skinfold thickness. The \"gold standard\" for body fat is the body density from which fat and fat-free body mass can be calculated. The new technique of bioelectric impedance analysis may substantially improve the estimation of total body fat. For estimating regional fat distribution, either waist to hip circumference ratio or subscapular skinfold have been most useful. Using the body mass index, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kilogram per square meter), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 26%, or 34 million, adult Americans aged 20 to 75 were overweight. The prevalence of severe overweight (a body mass index above 30 kg/m2) is higher in the United States and Canada than in Great Britain, the Netherlands, or Australia. Obesity results from an increase in energy intake relative to expenditure. Total daily energy expenditure includes energy used during resting metabolism, energy associated with the ingestion of food, and energy needed for physical activity. The obese are often observed to be less active, but since carrying a heavier load requires more energy, their total energy expenditure may not be low. A low resting metabolic rate has been suggested as a predictor of future risk of becoming obese. Adipose tissue is the major site for fat storage and may contain more than 90% of total energy stores. The increase in body mass index or degree of body weight is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, gall bladder disease, and diabetes mellitus. When fat is centrally located in either males or females, the risk for these diseases is also increased, and may be a more important risk factor than total overweight itself. Genetic factors form the background from which obesity develops. The best estimates suggest that these genetic factors may be of less importance than environmental events in determination of total body fat and its distribution. Obesity can be classified on the basis of the total number of fat cells and regional fat distribution by using the etiological factors which caused the obesity or by determining the age at which the obesity began. Regardless of the cause, treatment for obesity should be based on an evaluation of the individual's risk from obesity as compared with the risk of the treatment under consideration.

It is capable of demonstrating abnormal locations of gas, abnormal viscera, calcifications and foreign material, and skeletal and lower lung pathology. PFR findings may aid in the decision to proceed to other modalities. Contrast studies have a limited role in the ED but may be necessary to diagnose disease inadequately visualized by PFR, as in the case of perforated duodenal ulcer, missed on PFR in approximately 15 per cent of cases. Ultrasound is most useful in the ED for obstetric and gynecologic illness, as well as disorders of the hepatobiliary system. Nuclear medicine studies can be very useful for GI bleeding and inflammatory conditions but may not always be as available or convenient as other modalities. CT has very broad usefulness. Angiography is very useful for locating bleeding sites, especially in the large bowel, and for determination of mesenteric arterial patency in suspected mesenteric ischemia. Finally, MRI, which has enormous potential, is not funded by many third-party payment plans for use in emergencies, and must overcome certain obstacles before it assumes common usage in the ED.\r"

The result has been a significant reduction in morbidity owing to anesthetic complications, postsplenectomy sepsis, and peritoneal adhesions. To take full advantage of these advances, emergency physicians and other primary care providers should be aware of the often subtle manifestations of abdominal trauma, the available diagnostic modalities and their limitations, and the requirements for volume resuscitation in pediatric patients.\r"

  ".W": "The management of patients with penetrating abdominal trauma is outlined in Figure 1. Patients with hemodynamic instability, evisceration, significant gastrointestinal bleeding, peritoneal signs, gunshot wounds with peritoneal violation, and type 2 and 3 shotgun wounds should undergo emergency laparotomy. The initial ED management of these patients includes airway management, monitoring of cardiac rhythm and vital signs, history, physical examination, and placement of intravenous lines. Blood should be obtained for initial hematocrit, type and cross-matching, electrolytes, and an alcohol level or drug screen as needed. Initial resuscitation should utilize crystalloid fluid replacement. If more than 2 liters of crystalloid are needed to stabilize an adult (less in a child), blood should be given. Group O Rh-negative packed red blood cells should be immediately available for a patient in impending arrest or massive hemorrhage. Type-specific blood should be available within 15 minutes. A patient with penetrating thoracic and high abdominal trauma should receive a portable chest x-ray, and a hemo- or pneumothorax should be treated with tube thoracostomy. An unstable patient with clinical signs consistent with a pneumothorax, however, should receive a tube thoracostomy prior to obtaining roentgenographic confirmation. If time permits, a nasogastric tube and Foley catheter should be placed, and the urine evaluated for blood (these procedures can be performed in the operating room). If kidney involvement is suspected because of hematuria or penetrating trauma in the area of a kidney or ureter in a patient requiring surgery, a single-shot IVP should be performed either in the ED or the operating room. An ECG is important in patients with possible cardiac involvement and in patients over the age of 40 going to the operating room. Tetanus status should be updated, and appropriate antibiotics covering bowel flora should be given. Operative management should rarely be delayed by procedures in the ED. Only lifesaving procedures necessary to prevent further deterioration should temporarily delay sending a patient to a waiting surgical team. Stable patients can be further evaluated in the ED. Those with stab wounds to the abdomen, flank, and selected cases of back injuries should undergo LWE. Those with negative LWE can be discharged after appropriate wound care and patient education. Patients with equivocal or positive LWE should undergo DPL. Patients with tangential gunshot wounds and possible type 2 shotgun injuries can undergo DPL. Table 8 lists the recommended thresholds for DPL. Patients with positive DPL should undergo exploration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Drugs may cause intestinal ileus or obstruction by pharmacologic actions (i.e., anticholinergic drugs and narcotics) or by mechanical obstruction (charcoal and drug bezoars). 3. Abdominal pain simulating an acute abdomen may result from systemic effects of black widow spider envenomation or intoxication with heavy metals such as lead and arsenic. 4. Ischemic bowel disease may occur from use of vasoconstrictor drugs, such as ergotamines, amphetamines and cocaine, or may follow treatment with catecholamines or digitalis in critically ill patients. Small bowel ischemia is life-threatening and may require bowel resection. 5. Many drugs cause abdominal pain by directly injuring abdominal organs, such as the liver and pancreas. Antibiotic-associated colitis may present with abdominal pain and inflammatory diarrhea. Consideration of drugs and toxins plays an important role in the differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen.\r"

A careful history and physical examination should be performed to rule out conditions that mimic ascites. Ultrasonography should be performed in questionable cases of ascites since physical examination and radiographic signs of ascites are unreliable. Paracentesis can help determine the etiology. Ascitic fluid should be examined to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, one of the few curable complications of cirrhosis. An ascitic fluid PMN count of greater than 250 per mm3 proves a sensitive indicator of infection. Medical treatment of cirrhotic ascites includes dietary sodium restriction and diuretics++. Large-volume paracentesis, with or without the use of colloid infusions, may provide useful adjunctive therapy. In rare instances, intractable ascites may be treated with a peritoneovenous shunt, although the complications and mortality rate of this procedure are significant. Peritoneovenous shunting, however, has not been shown to improve survival.\r"

No other laboratory test results were abnormal. While waiting for the surgeon to arrive, the patient remains stable, so the ED physician orders a CT scan of the abdomen. Taking another look at the plain x-ray films, the emergency physician in our case presentation sees a suggestion of free air under the right hemidiaphragm above the liver on the CXR and between the liver and the right abdominal wall on the decubitus ABD x-ray. The CT scan confirms the presence of free air within the peritoneal cavity, and the patient is taken to surgery for an exploratory laparotomy. The final diagnosis is perforated peptic ulcer.

Other mice received only an oral challenge with the same antigens (oral controls; n = 20 per treatment). Three weeks after the booster challenge (day 36), 20 mice in each group were orally immunized with the antigens, whereas the other 20 were not (IP controls). Cytotoxic antibody titers (immunoglobulin M) to human sperm were significantly higher in mice IP immunized with sperm or seminal plasma from autoimmune infertile men or orally immunized with autoimmune men's sperm, in contrast to the controls. Oral challenge with sperm or seminal plasma of autoimmune infertile men after the IP immunization with the same resulted in significantly decreased cytotoxic sperm antibody titers (P less than 0.001 versus oral or IP controls in sperm immunization; P less than 0.001 versus IP controls in seminal plasma immunization). Fertility was unaffected by any mode of immunization. It is concluded that, in mice, sperm and seminal plasma antigens from autoimmune infertile men are more immunogenic than those from nonautoimmune fertile men, and oral challenge with the former after an IP establishment of cytotoxic sperm immunity desensitizes the immune mice. These findings may have practical implications in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of infertile men with cytotoxic sperm antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous metoclopramide, alone or in combination with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), in distinguishing between constitutional delay of puberty and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 12 patients with constitutional delay of puberty and 10 patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were studied. All patients received 10 mg/m2 of intravenous metoclopramide and 100 micrograms of intravenous LH-RH on separate days. The mean prolactin (PRL) response following metoclopramide was significantly higher in the constitutional delay of puberty group when compared with the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism patients (P less than 0.01 at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes); all patients with constitutional delay of puberty increased their PRL level to greater than or equal to 60 ng/ml, except one who had a peak PRL level of 38 ng/ml. While only 2 of the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism subjects reached a peak PRL concentration of greater than or equal to 60 ng/ml, 4 had peak PRL levels greater than 38 ng/ml. The mean LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) responses after LH-RH were significantly higher in the constitutional delay of puberty group (P less than 0.01 at 30, 45, and 60 minutes for LH and P less than 0.01 at 45 and 60 minutes for FSH). All constitutional delay of puberty subjects responded to both the metoclopramide and LH-RH tests, while patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism responded only to one or to neither of these tests. Therefore, while metoclopramide alone did not allow us to clearly distinguish constitutional delay of puberty from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the combined use of both of these stimuli permitted us to detect all subjects with constitutional delay of puberty.\r"

Fat mass was estimated by hydrostatic weighing. Concentrations of SHBG and testosterone (T) and cumulative insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test were measured. The cumulative insulin response was inversely related to SHBG (r = -0.56, P less than 0.01). The relationship between SHBG and cumulative insulin response remained significant (r = -0.47, P less than 0.01) after adjusting for fat mass and T. The fat mass correlated significantly with SHBG (r = -0.51, P less than 0.01). The relationship of SHBG to fat mass remained significant after adjusting for T (r = -0.45, P less than 0.01). However, the relationship between fat mass and SHBG was no longer significant (r = -0.34, P greater than 0.05) after adjusting for cumulative insulin response. Hyperinsulinemia may play an important role in the progressive reduction of SHBG observed with increasing adiposity.\r"

The number of oocytes retrieved showed a significant correlation with serum inhibin level on the day of hCG administration (r = 0.84, n = 15, P less than 0.001).

A comparison group of women attending for genetic counseling for advanced maternal age also was assessed. The results showed the two patient groups to be comparable on psychological testing. The IVF-GIFT group tended to be more concerned about a problem developing but were not more anxious. Attitude ratings showed the IVF-GIFT women to have greater investment in the pregnancy and the fetus. A comparison of scores before and after the ultrasound showed anxiety reduction for women seeing the fetal heartbeat. Attitude ratings were more positive for the women seeing the fetal heartbeat, with change less pronounced in women denied this feedback. These results confirm the effects of diagnostic testing on emotional state. Women with IVF-GIFT pregnancies show both higher concern than documented elsewhere in low-risk pregnancies, as well as greater emotional investment in the fetus.\r"

Nineteen adults with diarrhea due to Vibrio cholerae were treated with clonidine (0.9 mg/24 h orally for 72 h) and 18 served as controls. During the first 24 h of treatment and for 24 h afterwards, the mean +/- SD concentrations of sodium (in millimoles per liter) in the stools of clonidine-treated patients were 120.6 +/- 10.9 and 112.3 +/- 11.9, which were significantly lower than 135.5 +/- 17.1 and 125.0 +/- 16.4 in the controls (p less than 0.01). Stool chloride concentrations (in millimoles per liter) were also significantly less in the clonidine group during the same periods: 82.1 +/- 16.8 and 62.4 +/- 19.4 vs. 92.1 +/- 18.3 and 78.0 +/- 23.0, respectively (p less than 0.05). Concentrations of potassium but not bicarbonate were also significantly reduced in the stools of clonidine-treated patients (p less than 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the mean +/- SD stool volumes (in liters) between the clonidine and the control group in any of the six 12-h periods after treatment or in the cumulative volumes in 72 h (24.2 +/- 10.6 and 22.9 +/- 8.3, respectively). We conclude that clonidine causes modest reduction of stool electrolyte loss but does not significantly reduce fecal fluid loss in patients with cholera.\r"

Three monoclonal autoantibodies, designated as 2B6 (IgG1), 2G10 (IgG2b), and 1H9 (IgG1), were obtained from one of these mice. All three reacted specifically with parietal cells, 2G10 recognizing species-specific antigenic determinants and 2B6 and 1H9 recognizing interspecies-specific antigenic determinants. All three recognized antigens on the membrane of intracellular secretory canaliculi and the cytoplasmic tubulovesicular system of parietal cells. At least two different molecular groups were recognized by these antibodies; 2B6 recognizing a 65,000-79,000-mol wt group and 1H9 recognizing a 92,000-120,000-mol wt group. Sera of most mice with autoimmune gastritis reacted with either or both groups. Both groups were consistently coprecipitated by any of the three antibodies when solubilized in NP-40. Sera, from patients with pernicious anemia, containing anti-parietal cell antibodies could also precipitate these two groups of antigens. Competition assay and physicochemical studies showed that the epitopes recognized by the three monoclonal antibodies are different.\r"

  ".W": "Shiga toxin, produced by Shigella dysenteriae 1, causes enterotoxic, cytotoxic, and neurotoxic effects, which may be mediated by a glycolipid receptor, globotriaosylceramide, Gb3. To study the relationship of this receptor and toxin effects, globotriaosylceramide was quantitated and further characterized in rabbit small intestinal microvillus membranes at various ages. Glycolipids were extracted from rabbit microvillus membranes, purified on Unisil columns, and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The major glycolipid peaks were hydroxylated fatty acid-containing glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide. There was a marked increase of globotriaosylceramide levels with age, ranging from 0.02 to 16.2 pmol/micrograms microvillus membrane protein in neonates and adults, respectively. The globotriaosylceramide peak was susceptible to alpha-galactosidase treatment, which produced an elevation in the lactosylceramide peak, but markedly reduced globotriaosylceramide content in 34-day-old rabbits. Binding of iodinated Shiga toxin to globotriaosylceramide was documented on high-performance thin-layer chromatography plates by autoradiography. The glycolipid receptor for Shiga toxin in rabbit microvillus membranes is thus a hydroxylated fatty acid-containing globotriaosylceramide. This moiety is virtually absent in neonates and gradually increases with age. Quantitative differences in globotriaosylceramide may be the underlying basis for the age-specific differences in functional responsiveness of rabbit intestinal tissue to Shiga toxin.\r"

  ".W": "Normal colonic epithelial cells consist of several cell types or lineages that are thought to arise from a common stem cell precursor. Neoplastic transformation may occur at different stages in the differentiation of a colonic stem cell to produce tumors that may retain characteristic cell lineage phenotypes. In this study, immunohistochemical techniques were used to identify cell lineage-related markers in fetal, normal, hyperplastic, adenomatous, and cancerous colonic tissue. These markers consisted of secretory component (columnar cells), a purified mucin antigen (mucous or goblet cells), chromogranin A (enteroendocrine cells), lysozyme (Paneth cells), and carcinoembryonic antigen (panepithelial cell marker). Colonic neoplasms, like normal mucosa, predominantly expressed the markers of columnar and goblet cell lineages. Chromogranin A was expressed in a small population of cells in most normal and fetal colonic crypts. Chromogranin A reactive cells were found in 55% of hyperplastic polyps, 31% of adenomatous polyps, and 33% of carcinomas. Lysozyme reactivity was rare in fetal, normal, and hyperplastic specimens, but was present in 86% of adenomas and 40% of carcinomas. Of 42 primary carcinomas, 9% were \"pluripotent\" and expressed markers of all four cell lineages. In addition to columnar and goblet cell markers, 7% expressed both enteroendocrine and Paneth cell markers, 17% expressed enteroendocrine cell markers, and 24% expressed Paneth cell markers. Two cases (5%) lacked expression of any of the cell lineage markers. The remainder expressed only columnar and goblet cell markers. The markers used in this study appear to identify the major cell lineages of fetal and normal colonic epithelium and can be used to delineate the altered cell lineage phenotypes in premalignant and malignant colonic mucosa.\r"

Bile samples taken 2-3 days before clinical rejection were more chemotactic for lymphocytes than samples taken during rejection (p less than 0.01), during stable graft function (p less than 0.001), and from nontransplant patients (p less than 0.007). During clinical rejection there was an increase in bile chemotactic activity for both monocytes and neutrophils compared with samples from stable patients (monocytes: p less than 0.001; neutrophils: p less than 0.001) and nontransplant patients (monocytes: p less than 0.001; neutrophils: p less than 0.001). In serial studies chemotactic activity for lymphocytes reached a peak 1-3 days before the onset of clinical rejection, whereas maximum chemotactic activity for monocytes and neutrophils occurred at the time of rejection, when lymphocyte chemotaxis was decreasing. These results suggest that chemotaxis may be important in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to liver allografts and that chemotactic factors for lymphocytes, which appear in bile before clinical rejection, may be critical in the pathogenesis of rejection.\r"

The patient presented with a short history of peptic ulceration and development of a large pelvic mass. Investigations demonstrated a basal acid output of 37.8 mEq/h and a maximal acid output of 36.0 mEq/h, and the plasma concentration of gastrin was 830 pg/ml (normal less than 100). Secretin and calcium infusion tests were positive, and a meal test was compatible with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Imaging studies demonstrated a normal liver and pancreas but a large cystic right ovarian mass. Resection of the mass resulted in a marked reduction in gastric acid output, a fall in plasma gastrin concentration to normal, negative calcium and secretin tests, and a normal (positive) meal test. Histology of the mass showed it to be a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. The tumor stained with immunoperoxidase technique was positive for gastrin, and the cyst fluid contained high concentrations of gastrin and calcitonin. One year later, the patient has no biochemical or imaging evidence of tumor. Ovarian, gastrin-producing tumors and pancreatic gastrinomas cannot be distinguished by provocative tests, and negative imaging studies do not exclude a pancreatic tumor. Patients with an ovarian mass and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome should have a bilateral oophorectomy and a careful exploration of the pancreatic area.\r"

After 2 years of observation, 24 patients were allocated randomly to one of two groups: 12 patients served as untreated controls and 12 received recombinant human alpha-interferon-2a in a dose of 9 million units intramuscularly three times weekly for 16 weeks. Patients who remained viremic after 16 weeks received 3 million units three times weekly for an additional 8 weeks. Abnormal amino-transferases and serum hepatitis B virus DNA persisted without appreciable changes in all untreated patients. Hepatitis B virus DNA rapidly became undetectable and serum aminotransferases fell to normal in eight treated patients. After the end of treatment, hepatitis B virus DNA became detectable once again in seven patients, in six of whom a peak of aminotransferases (range: 256 to 850 units per liter) ensued; subsequently, hepatitis B virus DNA disappeared, and serum aminotransferases again fell to normal in two of the seven. Overall, hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum and liver histology improved in three treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
