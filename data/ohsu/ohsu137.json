Five cases of Dandy-Walker syndrome, one of the major causes of congenital hydrocephalus, were diagnosed antenatally. In all cases ultrasound allowed specific recognition of the defect in the cerebellar vermis. This defect connected the fourth ventricle to a posterior fossa cyst in four cases and to an occipital meningocele in one case. In three cases the diagnosis was made prior to viability, and the parents elected termination of pregnancy. In two cases recognized in the third trimester, neurosurgical care was provided soon after delivery.\r"

During a second episode of UTI chemotaxis again became defective. Inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis seems to be at least one mechanism in the pathogenesis of UTI.

The study shows important differences in death rates between individual hospitals and higher cumulative probability of reoperation following transurethral compared with open prostatectomy. The advantages of claims data are low cost, ease of patient follow-up over long periods, and the absence of reporting bias. The limitations are the adequacy of the data used to control for patient comorbidity and the lack of outcome information on functional status. The effective use of claims data for monitoring requires the active participation of physicians in improving the data base and interpreting the findings.\r"

  ".W": "The expression, tissue distribution, and preliminary characterization of a cell surface molecule, apparently a glycolipid, recognized by a monoclonal antibody, anti-PAA, were described. This antibody (anti-PAA) was produced by the fusion of myeloma cells NS-1 with spleen cells from a BALB/c mouse, which were sensitized with activated human T-cells generated by allogeneic stimulation in mixed-lymphocyte culture (MLC). Resting human peripheral blood T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes demonstrated weak anti-PAA binding. Binding of proliferating T-cells (phytohemagglutinin- and MLC-activated T-cells) and thymocytes to anti-PAA was two to six times greater than that of resting T-cells. A fifteenfold-increased binding was observed with acute lymphocytic leukemia T-cell lines. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines bound anti-PAA up to sixteenfold greater than resting B-cells. Tumor cell lines of various nonlymphoid origins demonstrated marked reactivity with this antibody. Both benign and malignant cells in hyperplastic tissues, of various origins, bound anti-PAA, whereas their normal, nonproliferating counterparts did not. Normal proliferating cells in these tissues, including cells of the placental chorionic villi and trophoblasts, also bound anti-PAA. Of all lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines examined, only chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and some cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphoma showed weak or no binding. This antibody also failed to react with a variety of nonprimate cell lines. Anti-PAA antibody did not immunoprecipitate any protein from lymphoid tumor cell lines to which it demonstrated a quantitatively high degree of binding, nor did protease treatment of these lines decrease antibody binding. Anti-PAA did, however, bind to glycolipids extracted from these cell lines. Binding of this monoclonal antibody to a minor neutral glycolipid, isolated from the erythroleukemia cell line K562, was about sixfold greater than that of any other K562 neutral glycolipid or ganglioside. Anti-PAA demonstrated weak or undetectable binding to purified, predominant, lymphoid cell membrane's neutral glycolipids and gangliosides. The monoclonal antibody anti-PAA appeared, therefore, to recognize a unique, proliferation-associated, neutral glycolipid present on normal as well as on benign and malignant proliferating cells. The antigen appeared to be universally expressed on proliferating cells from all human tissues with the exception of some Burkitt's cell lines and CLL cells. Nonhuman cell lines, except those for closely related primates, did not express PAA.\r"

  ".W": "This study addressed the possible relationship between B-cell maturation stage of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, ethnic group, or type of chromosome translocation. Fifty-seven cell lines obtained at the International Agency for Research on Cancer from 51 patients were studied. Cytogenetic analyses of 54 cells lines were available. Cell size, surface immunoglobulins (sIgs), cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (cIgs), mouse red blood cell receptors, and reactivity with various monoclonal antibodies were assessed. Immunoglobulin (Ig) class secretions were measured in the supernatant of 2- and 5-day cultures from 33 cell lines, with the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. From this study, BL appears to cover a broad range of the B-cell differentiation sequence, since the following Ig phenotypes were observed: null cells (sIg-, cIg-), large pre-B-cells (intracytoplasmic mu-chains), small B-cells (sIg+, cIg-), and various types of secreting B-cells (sIg+, cIg+). Among the latter, various patterns of cIg could be defined (perinuclear, paranuclear, and vesicular). B-cell maturation stages were correlated with the amount of secreted Ig. In sIg+ cell lines, different classes of Ig were found: 35 IgM, 10 IgM plus IgD, 4 IgG, and 1 IgA. None of the different monoclonal antibodies used was specific to a precise stage of maturation. The stages of maturation were correlated with neither the type of chromosome translocations of BL nor the presence of EBV genome, but the most immature cell lines were all EBV positive and most of them originated from African patients. In contrast with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen (CD10) was expressed on nearly all BL cell lines of intermediate maturation stages but only on half of the pre-B ones. In addition, none of the cell lines tested was found to react with CD5 antibodies, which recognize most of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the same stage of maturation as that in the B-lymphocyte lineage.\r"

  ".W": "A comprehensive description of the histopathologic characteristics of a spectrum of idiopathic lesions in feral English sole (Parophrys vetulus), a bottom-dwelling flatfish, from Puget Sound, Washington State, is presented. Among these lesions are unique degenerative conditions, regeneration, storage disorders, foci of hepatocellular alteration (putative preneoplastic lesions), hepatocellular and biliary neoplasms, and nonneoplastic proliferative conditions, all of which morphologically resemble the lesions induced by various hepatocarcinogens-hepatotoxins in experimental exposures of fish and/or rodents. Results from a statistical analysis of the patterns of co-occurrence of these lesions in English sole are consistent with the concept, developed from experimental studies of liver carcinogenesis in rodents, that there are morphologically identifiable steps representing progression toward hepatic neoplasms. This is the first study in which it has been possible to demonstrate a close morphological congruity between a set of idiopathic hepatic lesions in any feral population and an established series of hepatic lesions inducible in rodents by certain hepatocarcinogens under laboratory conditions. Since sediments from the habitats occupied by the fish in this study have been shown to contain multiple hepatocarcinogens, the findings strengthen cumulative evidence that English sole are useful as indicators of exposure to hepatocarcinogens in aquatic environments.\r"

The irradiation was administered in preparation for pancreatic transplantation. Two groups of animals (ten in each group) received 800 rad (8 Gy) and 1,000 rad (10 Gy) respectively over 4 to 5 weeks. A maximum of 200 rads (2 Gy) were administered weekly as photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. During irradiation the animals remained normoglycaemic in the presence of transiently elevated liver enzymes and serum amylase values, which returned to normal on completion of the irradiation. Insulin release was significantly reduced in both groups during irradiation and was associated with minimally decreased K-values in the presence of mild glucose intolerance. Pancreatic light morphologic changes included structural changes of both exocrine and endocrine elements and included necrosis of the islet cells and acinar tissue. Islet histology demonstrated striking cytocavitary network changes of alpha and beta cells, including degranulation, vacuolization, mitochondrial destruction, and an increase in lysosomes. A hypoplastic bonemarrow ranging from moderate to severe was observed in all irradiated recipients. Near total fractionated body irradiation in the primate is therefore associated with elevated liver enzymes, pancytopenia, transient hyperamylasaemia, hypoinsulinaemia, a varying degree of pancreatitis, and bonemarrow hypoplasia.\r"

However, the serum LD activities did not change in parallel with the serum B12 levels suggesting that there was little necrosis of the tumour or the liver. With two out of five patients with other types of cancer the serum B12 levels also increased but less markedly. This data seems to suggest that the serum B12 level may not be as good a tumour marker for hepatocellular carcinoma as has been suggested and indeed may be influenced by the chemotherapeutic agent.\r"

The process continues throughout life with the relentless attrition of the oocyte's capital through three fundamental events: follicle degeneration or atresia, corpus luteum formation, and transformation of varying cell populations from atretic and luteal complexes into stromal cells. The ultimate consequence of ovarian aging is the modulation of this organ from a follicle-rich, cyclic secretor of estrogen and progesterone to a stroma-rich, noncyclic, low secretor of androgen. Other structural features of the \"aged\" ovary, such as obliterative arteriolar sclerosis and surface epithelium cysts, indicate that obvious involution is admixed with persisting ovarian activity. It appears, then, that even after the reproductive period has ended, the human ovary is still a viable organ. The contribution of this organ to the overall well-being of the postmenopausal woman remains to be defined.\r"

The knowledgeable physician can give good explanation, which is sometimes as beneficial as medications. Hormone replacement therapy may improve physiologic function of some tissues and relieve symptoms. When hormones are given for clear indications in as safe a method as possible and with adequate monitoring, the woman will have her symptoms relieved and will be grateful for her sense of well-being and ability to enjoy life.\r"

  ".W": "The ability to perform physical activity, whether at work or as recreation, is an important aspect of human experience for men and women of all ages. The extension of the range of physical power output that characterizes improvement in \"physical fitness\" is a desirable goal for all. It helps to make physical activity more enjoyable and less fatiguing, it can facilitate the learning of new skills and may actually improve cognitive functions, and it decreases the likelihood of physical injury and helps to speed recovery from injury. A sound mind in a sound body has been a medical ideal since Greek and Roman times. For a continuing state of good health, all systems--physical, mental, and spiritual--should be exercised in harmony. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the average life span for women was barely 5 years beyond the menopause. Menopause heralded the twilight years of life and enhanced susceptibility to disease and deterioration of health. Today, women look forward to 25 additional years, a full one third of a lifetime; menopause now heralds potential promise, adventure, and exploration, an exciting new phase of the life cycle. Exercise represents a vital part of a prescription to maximize quality of life throughout this period. Physical conditioning cannot be expected to complete reverse the unrelenting effects of passing time, but it appears that it can substantially modify this process. Functional losses that in the past have been attributed only to age may, in fact, represent a combined effect of biologic aging and physical inactivity. Exercise helps to maintain the physiologic adaptations that support an enhanced biologic reserve in body systems that tend to lose reserve capacity with advancing age. \"If you don't use it, you lose it!,\" and its positive corollary, \"If you use it, you enthuse it!,\" may be maxims that imply a natural law of deep consequence. An optimal diet and suitably vigorous activity are advisable for all women as they enter the postmenopausal phase of life. Every mature woman ought to carefully consider choosing to pursue an appropriate goal: active participation in a specific exercise program under medical supervision. The health care system should be fully responsive to the special needs of the mature woman, and the importance of providing programs of physical activity designed to address these needs should be recognized. For the postmenopausal woman, the advantages of achieving a state of physical fitness are many.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The concept that women's psychologic health and physical health are closely tied to her reproductive function is coming under close scrutiny. The menopause is only one variable, along with other biologic, psychologic, and sociocultural stressors, that increases the individual woman's vulnerability to several psychiatric disorders. Careful attention to the patient's presenting symptoms and the specific diagnostic criteria for psychiatric illnesses allows for accurate diagnosis and treatment and avoids the pitfall of attributing these symptoms to the \"menopausal syndrome.\"\r"

  ".U": "87114246\r", 
  ".W": "Although the evidence is not conclusive, overall many sexual changes seem to occur in the climacteric years. It would be easy to propagate and perpetuate longstanding beliefs and myths that would do a great disservice to all of the women to whom our care is dedicated. In the coming years it is hoped that we shall learn more about how to understand these changes. In recent years the International Menopause Society has actively encouraged work in this area. An entire issue of its journal Maturitas is devoted to a series of scientific papers on sexuality in the climacteric years. For those who desire further reading that issue is strongly recommended. All medical professionals who come into contact with women during the climacteric years should be prepared to ask about sexuality and to deal with any concerns that arise. Taking a good sexual history along with a good general medical history and full social background is the best starting point for coping with these concerns. How to take a comprehensive sexual history is well described by Munjack and Oziel. Of course, it is not usual to take this full history on every woman with menopause symptoms. A few key questions should identify the woman who has sexual problems and facilitate selection of appropriate questioning for each patient (Table 2). Often, taking such a history allows the physician to identify a problem area that may be helped by medication or, more often, by education and simple office counseling. When it is clear that these simple approaches will not be adequate, the physician should have good resources for referral to the appropriate specialist, whether it be gynecologist, menopause center, psychologist, family therapist, or sex therapist.\r"

Millions of adults have frequent or chronic complaints about the quality and quantity of their sleep. Sleep complaints increase with increasing age and are more common in women than in men and in women over 45 than in younger women. Sedative-hypnotic drugs are taken more frequently by women than men, and the incidence of use increases with increasing age. Studies of sleep and sleep disturbances during the perimenopausal period suggest that difficulty falling asleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings result from hormonal changes, vasomotor symptoms, and possibly psychologic factors. Other causes for sleep complaints in menopausal and postmenopausal women are occult sleep disorders, especially periodic leg movements in sleep and sleep apnea syndrome. Sleeping pills are inappropriate for most patients with sleep complaints. If sleep difficulties persist after a trial of good sleep hygiene, further evaluation at a sleep disorders center is indicated.\r"

  ".W": "After treatment with chloroquine and pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, 118 school children aged 6 to 10 years living near the Kenyan coast were enrolled in a malaria chemoprophylaxis study and followed up for 20 weeks. Children were randomly assigned to receive either chlorproguanil 20 mg weekly (n = 78) or placebo (n = 37). The attack rate of Plasmodium falciparum infection was 42% in chlorproguanil recipients (39.8 episodes per 1000 person-weeks of prophylaxis) and 73% in placebo recipients (69.2 episodes per 1000 person-weeks, p less than 0.02). Sensitivity tests on 36 isolates successfully cultured in vitro showed that all 21 isolates from chloroproguanil recipients were resistant to dihydrofolate-reductase inhibitors, whereas only 3 of 15 isolates from the placebo group were resistant (p less than 10(-6)). Chlorproguanil in a weekly adult dose of 40 mg does not provide adequate prophylaxis against P falciparum in Kenya, probably because drug levels between doses fall below those required to suppress parasites resistant to dihydrofolate-reductase inhibitors.\r"

However, in the report group obstetricians allowed the pregnancies of those not selected for elective delivery to continue longer. There was no difference in the rates for elective delivery (induction of labour or caesarean section) in the two groups, whereas among those who went into labour (induced or spontaneous) emergency caesarean section was more frequent in the control group (23%) than in the report group (13%). Fetal distress in labour was also more common in the control group. Babies from the control group spent longer in neonatal intensive care (level 3) and needed more respiratory support than did those in the report group. The findings indicate that the availability of doppler studies leads to better obstetrical decision making.\r"

Significant improvement was maintained at 6 weeks after ciprofloxacin but not in the intravenous group. Improvement after ciprofloxacin was superior at day 10. Sputum weight decreased in both groups (p less than 0.001). Patient-recorded symptoms also improved in both groups. There was no serious toxicity or side-effects. Drug resistant organisms were isolated no more frequently after ciprofloxacin than after intravenous therapy. 17 of the ciprofloxacin-treated patients said they preferred oral treatment to intravenous therapy. Oral ciprofloxacin is a useful short-term treatment for patients with CF who are infected with Ps aeruginosa.\r"

  ".W": "Omeprazole 60 mg once daily was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in an endoscopically-controlled, double-blind randomised trial in 51 outpatients with erosive or ulcerative reflux oesophagitis (grade 2 or 3). Endoscopy was repeated after 4 weeks and, in the absence of healing, again after 8 weeks. Symptoms were assessed before entry and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Patients who were unhealed after 8 weeks were blindly switched to the other drug and treatment was continued for another 4 to 8 weeks. The healing rate (change to grade 0 or 1 oesophagitis) after 4 weeks was 19 of 25 patients treated with omeprazole and 7 of 26 patients treated with ranitidine (p = 0.002). The corresponding figures after 8 weeks were 22 of 25 and 10 of 26 (p = 0.001). The higher healing rate with omeprazole was reflected in a significantly faster and stronger improvement of reflux symptoms. 13 patients, who were unhealed after 8 weeks on ranitidine, were healed after switching treatment. Healing was achieved in 1 of 3 patients who were switched to ranitidine. There were no adverse events or changes in laboratory variables of clinical importance. Omeprazole is superior to ranitidine in the short-term treatment of reflux oesophagitis.\r"

Between these clinical episodes neither toxin nor Cl botulinum could be demonstrated. The illness was severe with quadriplegia, respiratory insufficiency, and bowel paralysis. In addition the patient had sensory abnormalities and a raised protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. The results demonstrate for the first time in detail an intestinal colonisation with and multiplication of C botulinum organisms and in-vivo production of toxin in an adult. The clinical findings at first pointed to Guillain-Barre syndrome, and it is suggested that patients with this syndrome should be examined for botulinum toxin in serum and for toxin and organisms in stool.\r"

BMT seemed superior in patients who relapsed within 18 months of first remission while on maintenance chemotherapy. BMT was not demonstrably superior in patients who relapsed more than 18 months after first remission. The choice of treatment in childhood ALL must be based on prognostic variables at diagnosis and on the circumstances of the relapse.\r"

Islet-cell autoantibodies were not found in any of the patients, and thyroid microsomal auto-antibodies were found in only one. The frequencies of the insulin-dependent-diabetes-associated antigens HLA-DR3 and DR4 were not increased among the propositi, and diabetes did not cosegregate with HLA haplotypes in the informative families. Insulin secretion, as measured by C-peptide responses to a liquid mixed meal (Sustacal), was intermediate between secretion in nondiabetic controls and that in patients with classic insulin-dependent diabetes. Peripheral-blood monocytes expressed increased numbers of insulin receptors as well as decreased empty-site affinities. The atypical form of diabetes in black Americans can be distinguished from classically defined insulin-dependent diabetes and may be best classified as a form of maturity-onset diabetes of youth.\r"

  ".W": "Systemically disseminated cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is generally resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We tested a treatment involving the extracorporeal photoactivation of biologically inert methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) by ultraviolet A energy to a form that covalently cross-links DNA. After oral administration of methoxsalen, a lymphocyte-enriched blood fraction was exposed to ultraviolet A (1 to 2 J per square centimeter) and then returned to the patient. The combination of ultraviolet A and methoxsalen caused an 88 +/- 5 percent loss of viability of target lymphocytes, whereas the drug alone was inactive. Twenty-seven of 37 patients with otherwise resistant cutaneous T-cell lymphoma responded to the treatment, with an average 64 percent decrease in cutaneous involvement after 22 +/- 10 weeks (mean +/- SD). The responding group included 8 of 10 patients with lymph-node involvement, 24 of 29 with exfoliative erythroderma, and 20 of 28 whose disease was resistant to standard chemotherapy. Side effects that often occur with standard chemotherapy, such as bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal erosions, and hair loss, did not occur. Although the mechanism of the beneficial effect is uncertain, an immune reaction to the infused damaged cells may have restricted the activity of the abnormal T cells. This preliminary study suggests that extracorporeal photochemotherapy is a promising treatment for widespread cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\r"

The computer system provides information about state-of-the-art cancer treatment, which is updated monthly by an editorial board. It also includes a file of active cancer-research protocols and a directory of physicians and organizations providing cancer care to which physicians can gain access by geographic location as well as other features. PDQ was designed for physicians who may not be familiar with computers, to permit them to search for and display information without learning a specialized search language. PDQ uses a computer mainframe, which allows a large amount of data to be stored and made available to physicians rapidly and accurately. Transmission of information about cancer over commercial telecommunication networks gives health professionals access to PDQ by means of a computer terminal and local telephone lines.\r"

In patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in whom proinsulin (0.2 U per kilogram of body weight) was subcutaneously injected at 9 a.m., fasting glucose levels (247 +/- 22 mg per deciliter [+/- SEM]) became normal within six hours and elevated rates of hepatic glucose output were lowered. The response to regular insulin (0.2 U per kilogram) was of similar magnitude but faster. Glucose clearance was stimulated less by proinsulin, reflecting its preferential action in suppressing glucose output. Hypoglycemia occurred in five of nine insulin-treated patients, but in only one of nine proinsulin-treated patients. After proinsulin injection at bedtime (30.5 +/- 4 U), serum proinsulin concentrations reached a peak by five hours and declined gradually thereafter. Fasting hepatic glucose output became normal, and euglycemia was sustained without overnight hypoglycemia. Proinsulin reduced plasma glucose more effectively than an equal unit dosage of NPH insulin, but since higher doses of NPH insulin were not used, no conclusions could be drawn about the relative desirability of these preparations for clinical use. We conclude that subcutaneously injected proinsulin has prolonged pharmacokinetics in plasma and can normalize plasma glucose in NIDDM characterized by severe hyperglycemia; as compared with the hypoglycemic effects of regular insulin, those of proinsulin are mostly due to suppression of hepatic glucose output, with little stimulation of glucose disposal and less hypoglycemia; and proinsulin may have a role in the treatment of NIDDM.\r"

A consideration of the replicative cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can lead to the identification of several steps that represent potential targets for antiretroviral therapy, and several substances that can inhibit the replication of HIV in vitro have already been identified. The 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides are a class of nucleoside analogues in which the 3'-hydroxy group is modified so that it cannot form phosphodiester linkages for nucleic acid chains. Some are potent in vitro inhibitors of HIV replication, possibly acting as chain terminators of viral DNA during reverse transcription. One of these dideoxynucleoside analogues, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), has now been administered for up to 18 months to patients with AIDS. The drug has been shown to improve immunologic function, to reverse, at least partially, HIV-induced neurologic dysfunction in some patients, and to improve certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. The principal toxic effect associated with AZT is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting particularly in anemia and leukopenia; however, most patients in whom this toxic effect occurs can subsequently tolerate a lower dose of the drug. The demonstration that AZT can be beneficial in patients with AIDS has removed some of the uncertainty about the rationale for an antiretroviral intervention in HIV infection.\r"

The ability of CNS endothelial cells to form a blood-brain barrier is not intrinsic to these cells but instead is induced by the CNS environment: Stewart and Wiley demonstrated that when avascular tissue from 3-day-old quail brain is transplanted into the coelomic cavity of chick embryos, the chick endothelial cells that vascularize the quail brain grafts form a competent blood-brain barrier; on the other hand, when avascular embryonic quail coelomic grafts are transplanted into embryonic chick brain, the chick endothelial cells that invade the mesenchymal tissue grafts form leaky capillaries and venules. It is, however, not known which cells in the CNS are responsible for inducing endothelial cells to form the tight junctions characteristic of the blood-brain barrier. Astrocytes are the most likely candidates since their processes form endfeet that collectively surround CNS microvessels. In this report we provide direct evidence that astrocytes are capable of inducing blood-brain barrier properties in non-neural endothelial cells in vivo.\r"

A special type of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum was postulated theoretically, and has since been verified. Each cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) receives two distinct excitatory inputs, one from parallel fibres (PFs) and the other from a climbing fibre (CF). When these two types of inputs are conjunctively activated, PF-PC transmission undergoes long-term depression (LTD). Accumulated evidence suggests that LTD plays a role in the motor learning processes of the cerebellum. At the molecular level, LTD appears to be caused by desensitization of receptor molecules in PC dendrites towards the PF neurotransmitter, presumably L-glutamate (Glu). Glu receptors are heterogeneous and can be divided into several subtypes. In this study, we compared the potency of several Glu agonists in inducing LTD and found a highly selective dependency of LTD on the quisqualate(QA)-selective subtype of Glu receptors.\r"

We used a strain of E. coli in which synthesis of the 4.5S RNA can be turned off by removing an inducer of the Iac operon, resulting in cell death.

  ".U": "87115836\r", 
  ".W": "There is considerable evidence that glutamate is the principal neurotransmitter that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate central nervous system. This single transmitter seems to activate two or three distinct types of receptors, defined by their affinities for three selective structural analogues of glutamate, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), quisqualate and kainate. All these agonists increase membrane permeability to monovalent cations, but NMDA also activates a conductance that permits significant calcium influx and is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by extracellular magnesium. Fast synaptic excitation seems to be mediated mainly by kainate/quisqualate receptors, although NMDA receptors are sometimes activated. We have investigated the properties of these conductances using single-channel recording in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, because the hippocampus contains all subtypes of glutamate receptors and because long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission occurs in this structure. We find that four or more distinct single-channel currents are evoked by applying glutamate to each outside-out membrane patch. These conductances vary in their ionic permeability and in the agonist most effective in causing them to open. Clear transitions between all the conductance levels are observed. Our observations are compatible with the model that all the single channel conductances activated by glutamate reflect the operation of one or two complex molecular entities.\r"

  ".W": "In the mammalian central nervous system amino acids such as L-glutamate and L-aspartate are thought to act as fast synaptic transmitters. It has been suggested that at least three pharmacologically-distinguishable types of glutamate receptor occur in central neurons and that these are selectively activated by the glutamate analogues N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate and kainate. These three receptor types would be expected to open ion channels with different conductances. Hence if agonists produce similar channel conductances this would suggest they are acting on the same receptor. Another possibility is suggested by experiments on spinal neurons, where GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) and glycine appear to open different sub-conductance levels of one class of channel while acting on different receptors. By analogy, several types of glutamate receptor could also be linked to a single type of channel with several sub-conductance states. We have examined these possibilities in cerebellar neurons by analysing the single-channel currents activated by L-glutamate, L-aspartate, NMDA, quisqualate and kainate in excised membrane patches. All of these agonists are capable of opening channels with at least five different conductance levels, the largest being about 45-50 pS. NMDA predominantly activated conductance levels above 30 pS while quisqualate and kainate mainly activated ones below 20 pS. The presence of clear transitions between levels favours the idea that the five main levels are all sub-states of the same type of channel.\r"

  ".W": "Transmitters mediating 'fast' synaptic processes in the vertebrate central nervous system are commonly placed in two separate categories that are believed to exhibit no interaction at the receptor level. The 'inhibitory transmitters' (such as glycine and GABA) are considered to act only on receptors mediating a chloride conductance increase, whereas 'excitatory transmitters' (such as L-glutamate) are considered to activate receptors mediating a cationic conductance increase. The best known excitatory receptor is that specifically activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) which has recently been characterized at the single channel level. The response activated by NMDA agonists is unique in that it exhibits a voltage-dependent Mg block. We report here that this response exhibits another remarkable property: it is dramatically potentiated by glycine. This potentiation is not mediated by the inhibitory strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor, and is detected at a glycine concentration as low as 10 nM. The potentiation can be observed in outside-out patches as an increase in the frequency of opening of the channels activated by NMDA agonists. Thus, in addition to its role as an inhibitory transmitter, glycine may facilitate excitatory transmission in the brain through an allosteric activation of the NMDA receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Receptors for excitatory amino acids in the mammalian central nervous system are classified into three major subtypes, ones which prefer N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate (QA), or kainate (KA) as type agonists respectively. These receptors are considered to mediate fast postsynaptic potentials by activating ion channels directly (ionotropic type). Recently it was reported that exposure of mammalian brain cells to glutamate (Glu) or its analogues causes enhanced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, but it is not clear whether the enhanced hydrolysis is the cause or effect of physiological responses. Membrane depolarization or Ca2+ influx, which can result from Glu receptor activation, can induce enhanced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids. We have characterized the functional properties of two types of excitatory amino-acid responses, those activated by QA (or Glu) and those activated by KA, induced in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat-brain messenger RNA. We report evidence for a new type of Glu receptor, which prefers QA as agonist, and which directly activates inositol phospholipid metabolism through interaction with GTP-binding regulatory proteins (Gi or Go), leading to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. This QA/Glu reaction is inhibited by islet-activating protein (IAP, pertussis toxin), but was not blocked by Joro spider toxin (JSTX), a specific blocker of traditional ionotropic QA/Glu receptors.\r"

Forty C-terminal amino acids of the normal receptor are replaced by 11 unrelated residues in the feline v-fms oncogene product, deleting a C-terminal tyrosine residue (Tyr969) whose phosphorylation might negatively regulate the receptor kinase activity. We show that the human c-fms gene stimulates growth of mouse NIH 3T3 cells in agar in response to human recombinant CSF-1, indicating that receptor transduction is sufficient to induce a CSF-1 responsive phenotype. Although cells transfected with c-fms genes containing either Tyr969 or Phe969 were not transformed, cotransfection of these genes with CSF-1 complementary DNA induced transformation, with c-fms(Phe969) showing significantly more activity than c-fms(Tyr969). In the absence of CSF-1, chimaeric v-fms/c-fms genes encoding the wild-type c-fms C terminus were poorly transforming, whereas chimaeras bearing Phe969 were as transforming as v-fms. Thus, the Phe969 mutation, although not in itself sufficient to induce transformation, activates the oncogenic potential of c-fms in association with an endogenous ligand or in conjunction with mutations elsewhere in the c-fms gene that confer ligand-independent signals for growth.\r"

In the cat, these cells are present in large numbers during development, when their location is correlated with the arrival and accumulation of ingrowing axonal systems and with synapses. However, as the brain matures, the cells disappear and the white matter and layer 1 of the adult emerge. Their disappearance occurs in concert with the invasion of the cortical plate by the axonal systems and with the elimination of the synapses from the subplate. Here we report that the subplate cells have properties typical of mature neurons. They have the ultrastructural appearance of neurons and receive synaptic contacts. They also have long projections and are immunoreactive for MAP2 (microtubule associated protein 2). Further, subpopulations are immunoreactive for one of several neuropeptides. These observations suggest that during the fetal and early postnatal development of the mammalian telencephalon the subplate cells function as neurons in synaptic circuitry that disappears by adulthood.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of cellular proto-oncogenes as a result of chromosomal abnormalities has been implicated in the development of some human malignancies. Perhaps one of the most striking examples of this association occurs in chronic myelogenous leukaemia, where the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation results in substitution of the 5' end of the c-abl proto-oncogene with bcr gene sequences. A unique hybrid bcr-abl message is produced. As the Ph translocation is also present in some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, we initiated studies to determine if similar genomic events occur in these two different forms of Ph-positive leukaemia. Here we report that the Ph translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia can result in production of a novel aberrant c-abl protein that is distinct from the bcr-abl protein found in Ph-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Our observations suggest that alternative mechanisms of activation of c-abl exist, and may be important in the development of human acute lymphoid rather than chronic myeloid malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome breakpoints in chronic myelocytic leukaemia are clustered on chromosome 22 band q11 in a 5.8-kilobase (kb) region designated bcr. The c-abl protooncogene is translocated from chromosome 9 band q34 into bcr and the biochemical consequence of this molecular rearrangement is the production of an abnormal fusion protein bcr-abl p210 with enhanced protein-tyrosine kinase activity compared to the normal p145 c-abl protein. The Ph chromosome translocation is also seen in some acute lymphoblastic leukaemias with B-cell precursor phenotypes some of which have bcr rearrangement (bcr+) and some do not (bcr-). We present evidence that the Ph+, bcr- leukaemias are associated with a novel p190 abl kinase. We propose that acute lymphoblastic leukaemias that are bcr+, p210+ are probably lymphoid blast crises following a clinically silent chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukaemia arising in multipotential stem cells whereas bcr-, p190+ cases are de novo acute lymphoblastic leukaemias arising in more restricted precursors.\r"

We have determined the sequences of the arabinose-H+ and xylose-H+ membrane transport proteins of Escherichia coli. They are homologous with each other and, unexpectedly, with the glucose transporters of human hepatoma and rat brain cells. All four proteins share similarities with the E. coli citrate transporter. Comparisons of their sequences and hydropathic profiles yield insights into their structure, functionally important residues and possible evolutionary relationships.

Middle-T can form a complex with the cellular src gene product (p60c-src) and can be phosphorylated by p60c-src in vitro. Studies using middle-T mutants have suggested that the association of middle-T with p60c-src may be necessary but not sufficient for transformation. Therefore, we addressed the possibility that middle-T could interact with other tyrosine protein kinases structurally related to p60c-src. Using antibody raised against a fusion protein between beta-galactosidase and amino-terminal sequences of p90gag-yes from Y73 virus (anti-yes antibody), we have found that middle-T can associate with and be phosphorylated by the c-yes proto-oncogene product, a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 62,000 (62K). This raises the possibility that the middle-T-p62c-yes complex contributes to transformation by polyomavirus.\r"

Using this approach we were able to detect the binding of GAL 4 protein at sites within the upstream activating sequence (UASG) previously mapped using other in vivo and in vitro foot-printing procedures. We also observed transcription-dependent changes in sensitivity of DNA to ultraviolet-induced covalent modification at several positions between the upstream activating sequence and the transcription initiation sites of the GAL 1 and GAL 10 genes. The most prominent of these changes occurs at a common site within the putative 'TATA' boxes of the two genes. Ultraviolet modification at this site is enhanced only in transcriptionally active promoters.\r"

Immunocytochemical techniques were used on excised tumor specimens to detect cells containing BrdU, and the BrdU labeling index (LI) was calculated as the number of BrdU-labeled cells divided by the total number of cells counted. Four medulloblastomas, three glioblastomas multiforme, and two highly anaplastic astrocytomas had average BrdU LIs of 13.0 +/- 3.0% (SE), 12.7 +/- 4.3%, and 14.6 +/- 6.7%, respectively. Three of nine moderately anaplastic astrocytomas had BrdU LIs of greater than 1% (average, 6.5 +/- 2.4%), whereas six had LIs of less than 1%. In two juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, which are considered slow-growing, the BrdU LIs were unexpectedly high, averaging 6.5 +/- 1.4%. Thus pediatric medulloblastomas, glioblastomas multiforme, highly anaplastic astrocytomas, and a minority of moderately anaplastic astrocytomas had high proliferative potentials, whereas most of the moderately anaplastic astrocytomas had low proliferative potentials. Although the number of cases in this study is still too small to yield statistically significant comparisons, the results indicate that some pediatric tumors have considerably higher LIs than histologically similar adult tumors studied previously.\r"

  ".W": "A low power carbon dioxide laser was used to perform 212 end-to-end laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses (LAMA) of femoral arteries (mean diameter, 1.2 mm) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Eighty-two conventional microvascular suture anastomoses (CMSA) utilizing 10-0 monofilament interrupted sutures were done for comparison of techniques and wound healing. The mean duration of each anastomosis procedure was 16 minutes for the LAMA repairs, compared to an average of 27 minutes for the CMSA repairs (P less than 0.05). All anastomoses were patent at the completion of the procedure. Each laser-assisted anastomosis required an average of seven intermittent laser exposures of 0.1 to 0.3 seconds each with approximately 80 mW of CO2 (wavelength = 10.6 micron) radiation at a spot size of 150 micron. A patency rate of 95% was obtained on the LAMA vessels (202 of 212) compared to 96% for the CMSA repairs (79 of 82). A total of 14 aneurysms were noted in the LAMA group (7%) compared to 11 in the CMSA (13%). All aneurysms were in patent vessels. Histological analysis indicates that the progression of wound healing of LAMA and CMSA anastomoses follows similar paths chronologically and morphologically with increased scar tissue formation around the suture. Scanning electron microscopy confirms the comparable luminal healing of the LAMA and CMSA vessels, with complete reendothelialization occurring by 3 weeks postoperatively. The tensile strength of the LAMA repair, although low immediately after operation, is comparable to that of the intact artery at 21 days. These findings suggest that a low energy carbon dioxide microsurgical laser has potential beneficial clinical application for anastomosis of small vessels.\r"

  ".W": "The human brain can be stimulated by electric shocks or by brief intense magnetic fields. The latter cause only a trivial scalp sensation. Stimuli exciting the motor cortex cause contralateral muscle responses, but the threshold for excitation is markedly reduced by slight voluntary contraction of the target muscle. For small hand muscles, the overall latency from scalp to muscle is shorter by 1.8 ms when electrical stimuli are used than when stimuli are magnetic. Central motor conduction time (CMCT) can be estimated by stimulating over the scalp and then over the cervical area. In healthy subjects, the CMCT is 6.1 +/- 0.8 (SD) (n = 29). Physiological studies have shown that the facilitation of responses in hand muscles produced by voluntary contraction is also present when contralateral muscles are used, but not when a leg muscle is contracted. The mechanism of facilitation may involve neural activity at both spinal and cortical levels. Single motor units can be caused to discharge by threshold brain stimuli. These motor units are the same ones activated first during weak voluntary contractions. Clinical studies have shown that the CMCT may be greatly prolonged in patients with multiple sclerosis and that subclinical motor pathway lesions can be detected. Central conduction may also be abnormal in patients with motor neuron disease and cervical myelopathy. Side effects have not been encountered with either type of stimulator.\r"

  ".W": "This contribution includes a selective review of previously published material, findings from some new experiments, and discussion of some relationships between animal and recent human data. The major questions are: What descends from the cerebral cortex after a brief surface stimulus? What explains the various components of the corticofugal discharge? What are the motor consequences of the corticofugal discharge, and what are the effects of lesions on both? The focus is on the corticospinal system, which through its monosynaptic connection with alpha motoneurons of distal muscles accounts for the short latency movements after a transient cortical stimulus. The pyramidal and lateral corticospinal tract response in monkey or cat to a surface stimulus applied to area 4 is a direct (D) wave conducted in fast axons followed by several indirect (I) waves with a period of greater than 1 ms. Although computer summing reveals, at increasing amplitudes, D and I waves in recordings from nuchal skin, vertebra, and surface of the spinal cord, \"killed end\" recording is essential to reveal the true extent of I relative to D waves. The D wave might result from excitation of: the initial segment (IS), i.e., the classical spike trigger zone; the first or deeper nodes in white matter; or arborizations of the axon collaterals in gray matter. Under different circumstances, each of these modes of excitation can be effective. Thus, with threshold stimulation through separated bipolar electrodes, intracellular recording from pyramidal tract (PT) and uninvaded motor cortical neurons shows that D activation usually occurs when the membrane potential immediately before the stimulus is relatively depolarized, implying excitation of the IS region, i.e., close to the site of synaptic transfer. A monopolar surface (+) stimulus at the appropriate focus usually generates a D wave at weaker intensity than does a surface (-) stimulus. However, if a little above threshold, stimuli of either polarity generate both D and I waves, but the ratio of D:I amplitude is usually greater with surface (+) stimulation. A theoretical estimate of the depth of excitation by a surface (+) stimulus was consistent with threshold excitation occurring at the first node. Slow PT neurons are excited by surface stimulation, but trivially contribute to population PT or corticospinal recordings. Intracellular recording from PT neurons identifies a monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential as the cause of the first I wave, the period between successive I waves reflecting single delays for synaptic discharge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Biophysical testing consisted of concurrent ultrasound observations of fetal breathing and body movements and electronic monitoring of fetal heart rate, coupled with determinations of fetal tone and amniotic fluid volume. Fetal breathing movement frequency and rate, fetal trunkal movement frequency, and baseline fetal heart rate were analyzed on a programmed microcomputer. The mean (+/- SD) breathing rate was 68.2 +/- 6.4 breaths per minute; mean breathing frequency, 55 +/- 22.6%; mean baseline heart rate, 141 +/- 8 beats per minute; mean trunkal movement incidence, 5.5 +/- 2.6%; and mean acceleration frequency, 14.6 +/- 9.8 per hour. No fetus was apneic for more than eight minutes, and there were no significant correlations between fetal breath rates and the other biophysical parameters. There were no perinatal deaths. Seven fetuses experienced perinatal morbidity, of whom five had other abnormalities on biophysical testing. This study indicates that fetal tachypnea occurs more often than previously believed and does not generally signify fetal compromise unless other biophysical abnormalities are also present.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that treatment with antibiotics prevents low birth weight, pregnant women whose vaginal cultures contained Ureaplasma urealyticum or Mycoplasma hominis (or both) and who gave written informed consent were treated with one of the following: identical looking capsules containing 250 mg of either erythromycin estolate or stearate (active against U urealyticum), or 150 mg of clindamycin hydrochloride (active against M hominis), or placebo, four times daily for six weeks in a randomized double-blind study. Treatment with clindamycin had no effect. Treatment with erythromycin initiated during the second trimester had no effect on mean birth weight or on the frequency of low-birth-weight infants. In contrast, women whose treatment with erythromycin was initiated in the third trimester gave birth to infants with a heavier mean birth weight (3331 g) than infants born to placebo-treated women (3187 g) (P = .042). Similarly, in women whose erythromycin was begun during the third trimester, the birth rate of infants weighing 2500 g or less was 3%, whereas in women treated with placebo, the birth rate for low-birth-weight infants was 12% (P = .047). These data suggest that treatment with erythromycin during the third trimester prevents low birth weight in mycoplasma-colonized pregnant women. Whether the effect is due solely to the action of erythromycin on U urealyticum is uncertain.\r"

  ".U": "87116782\r", 
  ".W": "An analysis of the data on 52 infants whose mothers had contracted varicella during pregnancy revealed that 27 had congenital malformations ascribed to the maternal varicella infections, while another 25 developed herpes zoster in the early postnatal period. Most of the mothers whose infants had congenital malformations had contracted varicella within the first 20 weeks of gestation, whereas most of the mothers whose infants developed herpes zoster had varicella after 21 weeks of gestation. The clinical features of the various congenital malformations and dysfunctions after maternal varicella were diverse; however, there were peculiar segmental manifestations of anomalies of the skin, the peripheral nervous, the autonomic nervous, and the musculoskeletal systems, all of which receive common innervations from the same levels of the spinal cord. Most other dysfunctions may be ascribed to an encephalitis. Therefore, the mechanism of congenital malformations caused by varicella-zoster virus seems to be due not to fetal varicella but to the development of herpes zoster in utero and to an encephalitis associated with herpes zoster. At least one infant had congenital malformations that were due to maternal herpes zoster infection.\r"

An 18-year-old female with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia due to lack of endogenous GnRH was treated for 230 days using subcutaneous GnRH in an attempt to induce physiologic puberty. Just before anticipated menarche, therapy was discontinued because of the appearance of an urticarial reaction at the injection site as well as at previous injection sites. The presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against GnRH were subsequently identified in the patient's serum. These results further confirm the potential for antibody production to this small natural peptide in the female not previously exposed to GnRH. Some practical considerations for this form of therapy are highlighted.\r"

Thirty-five cats (seven groups) and 140 human patients (seven groups) were included in the study. Each experimental animal and human group was operated using one of the seven non-automated techniques. In each animal, one eye was operated with sodium hyaluronate and the other with Balanced Saline Solution (BSS). In each human group of 20 patients during cataract extraction and IOL implantation, sodium hyaluronate was used in half of the patients and BSS was used in the remaining ten. Eyes treated with sodium hyaluronate lost approximately 50% fewer endothelial cells and had approximately 50% less increase in corneal thickness than their counterparts treated with BSS. Based on the results of the endothelial cell loss and the corneal thickness, it is concluded that the most traumatic used technique was no. 2, followed by that of no. 5. The technique no. 7 may be considered as the most atraumatic of the tested procedures. Sodium hyaluronate effectively protected the endothelium, and its routine use in cataract surgery is recommended.\r"

Thirty-eight of 58 eyes achieved refractive errors within 2 D of emmetropia over the entire study; however, cases performed in the last 30 months achieved a mean refractive error close to emmetropia. Assuming that accurate axial length measurements were performed, the postoperative keratometry readings and, to a lesser degree, the \"A\" constant used in the regression formula had the greatest impact on the ultimate refractive error. Only a few cases had unacceptable refractive results possible due to inaccurate axial length measurement and/or incorrectly labeled intraocular lenses. The postoperative keratometry readings closely approximated the estimated preoperative readings that were used in the lens implant power calculation regression formula. With currently available techniques, the triple procedure appears to provide a useful modality for the correction of cases with a combined corneal opacity and a cataract.\r"

The lesions were, for the most part, diffuse proliferations of small lymphocytes, either with round or minimally indented nuclear outlines. Mitotic activity was sparse to nonexistent; occasionally there were scattered small abortive or residual germinal centers, and some lesions exhibited lymphoplasmacytoid features and dispersed multinucleated giant cells (polykaryocytes). None of the six patients with conjunctival lesions had extraocular manifestations. An identical tumor of the submandibular gland developed in one of eight patients with orbital lesions and another patient had multiple extranodal involvements of the oropharynx, liver, and both kidneys, but after chemotherapy the patient has survived for 8 years from orbital presentation and is currently in remission. The authors believe that these low-grade tumors share many biologic resemblances to extranodal lymphoepithelial tumors of other organs (lung, gut, parotid, thyroid), which as a group have been aggregated together as mucosa-associated lymphoid tumors (MALT) and which can often remain localized to their sites of origin.\r"

  ".W": "Of 36 patients, 17 had oral leukoplakia, including homogeneous and nonhomogeneous types, and 19 had reticular lesions of oral lichen planus. A sample of yeast flora in each patient was taken from the pathologic lesion as well as from normal-appearing mucosa. The isolated yeasts were identified according to species level, and identification was extended beyond the species level for one species, Candida albicans, to reveal the biotype by means of the Odds and Abbott procedure comprising tests for acid and salt tolerance, proteinase production, resistance to 5-fluorocytosine and safranine, and assimilation of urea, sorbose, and citrate. Yeasts were present in the lesions of 82% of leukoplakia patients, compared to 37% of lichen planus patients, a frequency of yeasts corresponding to that in healthy adults. C. albicans was the dominating species in lesions of both diseases, constituting 82% of all yeasts in the leukoplakia lesions. In addition, the following species were identified: Candida tropicalis, Candida pintolopesii, Torulopsis glabrata, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Eighteen biotypes of C. albicans were encountered, the most frequently occurring biotypes being 355 and 177. Differences between C. albicans biotypes isolated from pathologic and normal mucosa were encountered in five of eleven leukoplakia patients and in one of three lichen planus patients. This indicates that the oral cavity comprises several ecologic niches for yeasts. As nonhomogeneous leukoplakias are more likely to develop into carcinoma than are homogeneous leukoplakias, it is interesting to note that the C. albicans biotypes isolated from nodular lesions (one type of nonhomogeneous leukoplakia)--biotypes 145, 175, and 575--rarely occur.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the skin, delicate VIP, SP and CGRP fibres occur beneath the epidermis, sometimes running into the folds of the dermal ridges. In deeper layers of the dermis, small blood vessels are occasionally surrounded by single nerve fibres containing NPY, VIP, SP and CGRP. Large temporal and occipital arteries are surrounded by a meshwork of such fibres. In addition, NPY and VIP fibres are seen around sweat glands and hair follicles. Smooth muscle bundles in the dermis are surrounded by VIP fibres, whereas the temporal muscle per se is devoid of such fibres.\r"

  ".W": "The stress response in humans commonly includes elevations in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, glucagon, growth hormone, aldosterone, and renin, resulting in alterations in the metabolism of glucose and other energy substrates, and in increased sodium and water retention. In severe illness, triiodothyronine and sometimes thyroxine are decreased without evidence of clinical hypothyroidism. Antidiuretic hormone may be elevated in bacterial meningitis and other central nervous system disorders, as well as in acute asthma, chronic ventilator therapy, pneumothorax, atelectasis, and postoperatively. Increased ADH concentration can lead to significant hypoosmolality and hyponatremia with adverse effects on the patient. In the setting of severe intracerebral insults, ADH may be inappropriately low, resulting in diabetes insipidus. Insulin concentrations may be inappropriately low for serum glucose concentration, or insulin may have diminished receptor responsiveness in seriously stressed patients. Either situation leads to hyperglycemia. Disturbances in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium homeostasis may occur relatively frequently in the critically ill patient in response to therapeutic interventions, or illness-induced altered metabolism. It is not always clear when an altered metabolic or hormonal state is an appropriate response to a stress, or represents decompensation of the body's mechanisms for coping with that stress. It is important, however to recognize the common responses of the organism to severe illness, and to monitor for treatable abnormalities which occur.\r"

Additionally, the culture technique was compared to direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) for diagnosing chlamydial infections in the vaginas of prepubertal children. The study group included 50 consecutive prepubertal girls examined for sexual abuse in an urban pediatric hospital's emergency room. Vaginal swabs were obtained for culture and direct immunofluorescence assays of C trachomatis and for gonorrhea culture. Of these, 8/47 (17%) of the Chlamydia cultures, 4/43 (9.3%) of the direct immunofluorescence assay specimens, and 0/49 gonorrhea cultures were positive for Chlamydia. All patients with positive findings by direct immunofluorescence assay also had positive chlamydial cultures. Of the four other patients with positive cultures for Chlamydia, two had negative findings by direct immunofluorescence assay and two had inconclusive results reported. Twenty-nine patients had a syphilis serologic study performed, and all had negative results. There was no significant difference between the Chlamydia-positive and -negative groups with regards to age, race, nature of the abuse, frequency of abuse, and symptoms or findings on physical examination. Although not statistically significant, children with cultures positive for C trachomatis reported rectal penetration five times and vaginal penetration twice as often as those children with C trachomatis-negative results. This study demonstrates a significant prevalence of vaginal chlamydial infections in sexually abused children. Vaginal cultures for C trachomatis should be included in the medical evaluation of sexually abused girls. The culture technique was superior to the direct immunofluorescence assay in this group of patients.\r"

These resources, located mainly in academic institutions, required nurses to achieve the same credentials that obtain in other academic disciplines. The research activities spawned in this process needed a publishing outlet and nurse-educators created Nursing Research to provide that outlet. But some nurses always did research of a sort. The publication of Nursing Research in 1952 signified public, institutional recognition for research in nursing. Nurses initially approached the process of research in a manner that typified quintessential nursing procedure. Intently focused on process, the editors used the journal to teach the research process, yet did not define what constituted a proper study until 1959. All but a few focused on \"doing\" research and following correct procedures. Researchers mainly investigated practical questions addressing day-to-day issues of interest to the investigator--whether clinician, teacher, or manager. Creative ideas were not their central concerns. Although the journal's content changed over the years, its process of socializing nurses into the intricacies of research persisted until the 1980s. How to do research, the focus of the 1950s, became what is methodology in the 1960s, what is theory and how to get funded in the 1970s. The 1980s brought to fruition the journal's professional agenda to publish fully developed, frequently funded, theory-grounded research articles of which at least half consistently reported clinical studies. Increased replication to improve predictability and wider application in nursing practice comprise the current agenda.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ultrasonography is usually the procedure of choice in initial evaluation, but if acute cholecystitis is suspected, hepatobiliary scintigraphy is highly reliable and easy to perform. Computed tomography (CT) should be used if ultrasonography has not yielded the information needed; however, transient biliary obstruction cannot be diagnosed with CT unless ductal dilatation is present. The presence of laboratory data indicative of almost certain parenchymal liver disease should alert the physician to avoid unnecessary tests that are both costly and potentially dangerous. The final assessment of biliary duct patency may require transhepatic or retrograde cholangiography. Both procedures are effective but carry important potential complications.\r"

In the office or hospital, the usual measures are firm pressure, placement of a piece of cotton dipped in a cocaine-epinephrine solution, taking of a brief history, application of petrolatum, and taping of the nose. If bleeding persists, anterior nasal packing and, rarely, posterior packing should be performed. Maxillary artery ligation is done in cases of severe epistaxis. Special care must be taken with children who have a bleeding disorder or who are recovering from adenoidectomy.\r"

The patient became asymptomatic without treatment, and the eosinophil count returned to normal over several months.

Presumably, she acquired infection by hand-to-mouth transmission of infectious ova after handling the dog. Toxocariasis from this type of transmission is usually not seen in an adult, but it does occur, as this case demonstrates. Thus, the primary care physician should consider toxocariasis in any patient with a suggestive clinical picture and eosinophilia.\r"

However, these mechanisms represent the extremes of a continuum, and overlap among them can be encountered in some patients. A few simple clinical clues allow the physician to identify whether an increase in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, or both is the predominant mechanism in a given patient. Antihypertensive therapy should be aimed not only at lowering arterial pressure but also, more importantly, at ameliorating the concomitant pathophysiologic abnormality. A beta-adrenoreceptor blocker is the initial drug of choice in young patients with \"cardiogenic hypertension.\" In middle-aged patients, cardiac output is usually normal and elevated total peripheral resistance becomes the hemodynamic culprit. In these patients, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, antiadrenergic drug, or calcium channel blocker should be given to lower total peripheral resistance without affecting cardiac output. In elderly patients, the burden on the heart should be lessened by use of an agent that lowers preload and afterload, such as an ACE inhibitor or certain of the calcium blockers. In obese patients in whom intravascular volume is expanded and in most black patients, the initial antihypertensive agent of choice remains a thiazide diuretic unless left ventricular hypertrophy is present.\r"

Because the agents protect against such life-threatening conditions as ovarian and endometrial cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ectopic pregnancy, the number of deaths they prevent is larger than the number they cause. For nonsmokers up to age 40, OCs may offer more benefits than other available fertility-control methods, although for smokers 35 years of age or older, the risks of OC use outweigh the benefits. When risk factors for cardiovascular disease are taken into account in selecting OC users and when an appropriate agent is chosen, the likelihood of a cardiovascular accident is greatly reduced. The formulations containing low-dose estrogen and low-dose, low-potency progestins appear to be safest, as they have fewer adverse effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins.\r"

We now know that standard external CPR has numerous drawbacks, and modifications must be tested in a careful, randomized fashion. Three alternatives to standard external CPR (simultaneous compression-ventilation, interposed abdominal compression, and open-chest CPR) are currently being investigated. Of these procedures, open-chest CPR appears to show the most promise. Reproducible animal data must demonstrate the advantages of any method before widespread human studies are begun, however. If techniques seem promising in animals, well-controlled multicenter studies will be needed to verify applicability to humans. Major changes in CPR techniques should be made only after careful study, not on the basis of a limited number of reports from a single source. Resuscitation research must also extend beyond the study of techniques of cardiac massage. Although CPR is effective in some cases, clearly a person's chance of survival is directly linked to the speed of definitive care, that is, defibrillation. Research must continue into ways of providing rapid advanced cardiac care, such as home defibrillators or rapid prehospital response to the victims of cardiac arrest by those trained in advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). In addition, to counteract the problem of neurologic demise after prolonged anoxia, study of postresuscitative care must continue. Only through the combination of these measures will survival rates after cardiac arrest improve.\r"

Cells transfected with this vector and selected for resistance to the neomycin derivative G418 synthesized RNA complementary to 2-5A synthetase mRNA. These cells lacked 2-5A synthetase activity, and the enzyme was not inducible by interferon. In contrast, 2-5A synthetase was induced in cells transfected with a control vector without the cDNA insert. Such cells were protected by interferon from RNA viruses, whereas cells lacking 2-5A synthetase were not protected from encephalomyocarditis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and Sindbis virus but were fully protected from influenza virus. These findings show that a high level of 2-5A synthetase is required for interferon-induced protection from the cytoplasmic RNA viruses tested.\r"

By means of site-directed mutagenesis, point mutations have been engineered in the dimeric enzyme yeast triosephosphate isomerase that improve its thermostability. Cumulative replacement of asparagine residues at the subunit interface by residues resistant to heat-induced deterioration and approximating the geometry of asparagine (Asn-14----Thr-14 and Asn-78----Ile-78) nearly doubled the half-life of the enzyme at 100 degrees C, pH 6. Moreover, in an attempt to model the deleterious effects of deamidation, we show that replacement of interfacial Asn-78 by an aspartic acid residue increases the rate constant of irreversible thermal inactivation, drastically decreases the reversible transition temperature, and reduces the stability against dilution-induced dissociation.\r"

It has been shown that an efficient reaction in vitro requires, in addition to buffer and salt, only the Mu A protein, Mu B protein, host protein HU, ATP, and Mg2+. We have determined that, of the three protein factors involved, only the Mu B protein has an ATPase activity. The Mu B ATPase is stimulated by Mu A protein and DNA but not by either of these factors alone. Double-stranded DNA is a much better cofactor than single-stranded DNA, but there is no apparent sequence specificity. In the absence of the Mu B protein and/or ATP, the intermolecular Mu DNA strand-transfer reaction is extremely inefficient, and the strand-transfer products are predominantly the result of an intramolecular reaction. This contrasts with the efficient intermolecular reaction that occurs if Mu B protein and ATP are provided. The Mu B protein, in the presence of Mu A protein and protein HU, therefore, seems to facilitate interactions between potential DNA target sites and pairs of Mu DNA ends.\r"

This 19-kDa protein, unlike other virion proteins, possesses alkali-resistant phosphoamino acids. Analysis by partial proteolysis indicated that it is related to a 23-kDa phosphoprotein present in H2ts-1 virions assembled in infected cells maintained at 39 degrees C. Affinity labeling with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate showed that the 19-kDa protein contains the active site for a serine protease. We, therefore, conclude that the 19-kDa protein is the active form of the adenovirus-encoded endopeptidase, defined by the H2ts-1 mutation, and is synthesized as a 23-kDa precursor that appears to mature by autocatalysis.\r"

To study the mechanism by which thyrotropin enhances c-Ha-ras expression in the thyroid, we constructed a genomic library of FRTL5 DNA in the bacteriophage vector EMBL3. Using a v-Ha-ras probe (0.7-kilobase Sst I-Pst I fragment), we isolated eight clones containing portions of the FRTL5 c-Ha-ras gene. Restriction mapping of one of these clones revealed a structure very similar to that previously reported for the rat c-Ha-ras gene. We determined the nucleotide sequence of exon 1 as well as 1.15 kilobases upstream from exon 1. Blot-hybridization analysis of FRTL5 thyroid cell mRNA was performed with three DNA fragments upstream of exon 1. Two of these probes were Pst I-Pst I fragments 0.4 and 0.55 kilobases long, 1.15 and 0.6 kilobases upstream of exon 1, respectively. The third probe, a 0.6-kilobase Pst I-HindIII fragment, was immediately upstream of exon 1 and included 54 base pairs of the 5' end of exon 1. The data revealed an upstream (\"-1\") exon, consistent with the homology between the nucleotide sequences of our clone and the human c-Ha-ras gene in this region. Primer extension of a synthetic 30-mer oligonucleotide probe complementary to exon +1 on a FRTL5 mRNA template revealed three transcription start (cap) sites, 182, 169, and 153 bases upstream of the ATG codon. \"CCAAT boxes\" are present 65 and 100 bases upstream from the initial cap site. Three \"GC boxes\" and two C + G-rich inverted repeats characteristic of the binding site for the transcription regulation factor Sp1 are present in the 177 base pairs upstream of the initial cap site. Comparison of the rat and human c-Ha-ras -1 exons showed an area of poor homology immediately upstream of the human cap sites, followed further upstream by a region of close homology (approximately equal to 60 base pairs). The nucleotide sequence of the rat -1 exon is more similar to the v-ras sequence than is the human. The v-ras gene is truncated relative to both human and rat -1 exons.\r"

Two members of the rho family were isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. The yeast genes RHO1 and RHO2 are 70% and 57% identical, respectively, to the rho gene of the marine snail Aplysia, and they are 53% identical to each other. Inactivation of these genes showed that RHO1 is required for cell viability, while RHO2 is not an essential gene. A mutant allele of RHO1 (RHO1-His68) was constructed with a mutation analogous to one that activates the transforming potential of the human HRAS gene. Diploid strains containing RHO1-His68 in either low or high copy number are unable to sporulate, and the mutant allele is dominant over wild-type RHO1. The requirement for RHO1 cannot be circumvented by introduction of high copy number plasmids containing either the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or the mutant allele RAS2-Val19. Despite the conservation between the rho and ras gene families, the finding that RHO1 functions independently of the adenylate cyclase cAMP-dependent protein kinase cascade suggests that rho and ras are involved in distinct biochemical pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Retrovirus vectors offer a simple and highly efficient method for introducing new genes into mammalian cells. Here, we have examined the efficiency of gene transfer into hematopoietic cells with retrovirus vectors carrying the neomycin (neo) resistance gene expressed from different transcriptional regulatory regions. Direct infection of mouse bone marrow cells resulted in high efficiencies of gene transfer into a variety of myeloid progenitor cells, including pluripotent, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells with all the vectors examined. However, the progeny derived from individual pluripotent progenitor cells infected with different vectors differed markedly in the proportion of G418-resistant progenitor cells, as judged by their ability to survive selection in the drug G418. This biological assay suggests that the highest level of expression was observed when the neo gene was expressed from constructs that contained the herpes thymidine kinase promoter rather than the viral long terminal repeat or the simian virus 40 early region promoter. In contrast, neo gene expression was highest in fibroblasts infected with the vector containing the simian virus 40 early region promoter. These results show that high and sustainable levels of gene expression in hematopoietic cells can be obtained with retrovirus vectors containing appropriate transcriptional regulatory regions.\r"

  ".U": "87118254\r", 
  ".W": "The HNK-1 (Leu 7) and NC-1 monoclonal antibodies, raised against a human T-cell line and against nerve cells of quail embryos, respectively, have been shown to bind to a shared epitope present on the surface of human large granular lymphocytes and on nerve cells in species ranging from amphibians to humans. We demonstrate that a related antigen is also expressed on the lymphocyte surface in the avian central lymphoid organs, thymus and bursa, and in the spleen during embryonic and adult life. The expression of the HNK-1/NC-1-reactive determinant differs remarkably in the bursal and thymic compartments, antigen expression being stabilized at a high level early in development of the bursa, whereas its expression fluctuates in the thymus. The material immunoprecipitated from bursal and thymic lymphocytes by the HNK-1/NC-1 antibodies exhibits the same relative molecular mass as myelin-associated glycoprotein, which is one of the molecules recognized by these antibodies in the nervous system. Together with the observation that an antiserum reactive with the protein part of chicken myelin-associated glycoprotein detects similar material in membrane extracts of HNK-1/NC-1-positive thymocytes, this suggests that a molecule sharing structural analogies with this nerve cell component is expressed on cells of the immune system.\r"

  ".U": "87118262\r", 
  ".W": "Possible protective effects of the agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH (analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in which Gly-6 is replaced by D-tryptophan) and antagonist N-Ac-[D-Phe(pCI)1,2,D-Trp3,D-Arg6,D-Ala10]LH-RH against testicular damage caused by x-radiation were investigated in rats. Three months after being subjected to x-irradiation of the testes with 415 or 622 rads, control rats showed marked reduction in the weights of the testes and elevated levels of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), indicating tubular damage. Histological studies demonstrated that, in testes of rats given 415 rads, most seminiferous tubules had only Sertoli cells and no germinal cells, and, in the group given 622 rads, the depression of spermatogenesis was even more marked. Rats pretreated for 50 days with LH-RH antagonist (1000 micrograms/kg of body weight per day) showed a complete recovery of testicular weights and spermatogenesis 3 months after 415 rads and showed partial recovery after 622 rads, and LH and FSH levels returned to normal in both of these groups. Thus, pretreatment of rats with LH-RH antagonist, by reversibly inhibiting gonadal function, protected the germinal cells of the testes against damaging effects of x-rays. Three experiments were also carried out in which the rats were pretreated for 1-2 months with long-acting microcapsules of the agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH, liberating 25 micrograms of the agonist per day. Some rats were then subjected to gonadal irradiation with 415 or 622 rads and allowed a recovery period of 2-4 months. In spite of pretreatment with [D-Trp6]LH-RH, testicular weights were significantly lower and LH or FSH levels were elevated in the irradiated groups as compared with nonirradiated controls. The recovery of spermatogenesis was incomplete, and there was a decrease in the number of germinal cells after 415 rads and especially after 622 rads. On the basis of testicular weights, histology, and gonadotropin levels, it could be concluded that the agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH did not protect the rat testes exposed to 622 rads and, at most, only partially protected against 415 rads. These results suggest that pretreatment with LH-RH antagonists and possibly agonists, might decrease the testicular damage caused by radiation and accelerate the recovery of reproductive functions.\r"

Serially passaged cultures were established from these CJD agent-infected brains and from uninfected control brains. All healthy cultures (21 out of 21) from CJD agent-infected brains became immortal and/or transformed. In contrast only 3 out of 13 normal brain cultures became immortal, and the rest died out with serial propagation in vitro. The fact that permanent cell lines were readily derived from multiple rodent strains and all CJD isolates tested suggests that a transforming capability is an intrinsic property of CJD agents. This conclusion is supported by demonstrations of in vitro cell transformation by CJD infectious brain fractions. Although the molecular mechanism of transformation events associated with the CJD agent is not presently known, a provocative possibility is that the CJD agent has a direct effect on the host genome by mechanisms analogous to those known for slowly oncogenic retroviruses.\r"

Although the exact etiology of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown, vasculitis with wound ischemia and infection are prominent components. Inspired oxygen partial pressures of 1100 to 1300 mmHg elevate wound oxygen tension despite relative ischemia. The impaired intracellular bacterial killing of hypoxic leukocytes is corrected during each day's 2-hour bolus of hyperbaric oxygen. Daily wound oxygenation increases collagen production by fibroblasts to support capillary angiogenesis.\r"

In contrast, pretreatment with reserpine, which depletes catecholamines from adrenergic neurons, including the sympathetic post-ganglionic fibers, resulted in a significant increase in the survival area. It was concluded that both capsaicin-sensitive primary sensory neurons and sympathetic postganglionic adrenergic neurons play a role in systemic vascular regulation and that intact primary sensory neurons are of importance for the survival of ischemic tissue.\r"

Twenty-one patients had all four injections while four patients received injections on only one side. Sixteen of 25 patients coughed on at least one injection of diatrizoate, with three of these experiencing explosive coughing. One of 25 patients coughed with ioxaglate, and that was only minimally. This difference is statistically significant (P less than .001, on the basis of McNemar chi 2 test for paired data). When no coughing occurred, the quality of the diatrizoate and ioxaglate radiographs was indistinguishable. We conclude that ioxaglate is useful in pulmonary arteriography because of its lack of cough stimulation.\r"

Evaluation of the results of this policy in 1974 led to modifications of treatment based on analysis of disease recurrences. Since 1974, patients with large mediastinal masses or hilar disease have been treated with whole-lung or half-lung radiation. In addition, patients with stage IIIA disease with positive spleens were treated with liver irradiation. Sixty-five patients with Hodgkin disease treated with extended or total nodal fields and 126 patients treated with the radical radiation approach are evaluated. The use of this treatment modification has changed the prognostic factors and produced an improvement in recurrence-free survival that is statistically significant. The authors suggest that radical radiation therapy is the treatment of choice in patients with stage IA, IIA, or IIIA Hodgkin disease.\r"

However, accuracy of MR in demonstrating acute tubular necrosis in a larger number of patients is not known, and its accuracy in indicating recurrent glomerulopathy or infectious disease has not been addressed. The definitive role of MR in evaluating posttransplant renal failure is currently not established, but because of its high sensitivity in detecting renal abnormality, MR can be used for cases when results of US or scintigraphy are equivocal or contradict clinical impressions or when biopsy cannot be performed for medical reasons.\r"

Acute changes during the treatment of leukemia may reflect the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, whereas changes in the chronic phase of both diseases may prove useful in predicting treatment outcome.

Six tumors occurred in the neck, one occurred in the axilla, and one involved the soft tissues of the thigh, scrotum, and pelvis. A cystic hygroma characteristically appears as a multiloculated cystic mass with septa of variable thickness that contain solid components arising from the cyst wall or the septa. Correlation of the sonogram with the pathologic specimen demonstrated that the echogenic component corresponded to a cluster of abnormal lymphatic channels, too small to be resolved with ultrasound. Large lesions had ill-defined boundaries, with cystic components dissecting between normal tissue planes. Sonographically, one can usually differentiate these tumors from other cervical masses, especially soft-tissue hemangiomas. Sonography is also helpful in determining the extent of the lesion before surgery and in assessing postoperative complications and recurrences.\r"

The physical signs are not pathognomonic of the condition, and the classic technical examinations are of little help. Therefore, the authors retrospectively studied the value of hip arthrosonography in 46 children with clinical symptoms suggesting pathologic hip conditions. In 20 of the 21 patients with a final diagnosis of transient synovitis, articular effusion was detected on ultrasound (US). Conventional radiography showed an increased medial joint space in only eight of these patients. Increased echogenicity of the articular fluid was found in both transient synovitis and septic arthritis. The high sensitivity of US in detecting intraarticular fluid was demonstrated by cadaver studies.\r"

The technique combines selective excitation and visualization from an orthogonal view. The distance that fluid has moved is directly visualized. The blood flow velocity at every 50 msec throughout the cardiac cycle was measured in a short time (about 4 minutes) using electrocardiographic gating and repeated excitations in each cycle. Measurements were compared with those obtained by Doppler ultrasound (US) as a reference. The pulsatile change of flow velocity in the cycle correlated well with the Doppler US recording. Two flow velocity indexes, peak flow velocity and the velocity integral, also showed good correlation (r = .98 for both). This method is applicable for clinical use and is useful for measurement of high flow rates, as found in arteries.\r"

In addition, there is no ideal means of measuring infarct size as yet. However, considerable progress has been made in understanding mechanisms responsible for irreversible cellular injury and in identifying factors and anatomic alterations responsible for or contributing to the development of transmural (Q wave) and non-transmural (non-Q wave) myocardial infarcts. Interventions are available that are capable of causing rapid coronary thrombolysis, and techniques are becoming available tht have increasing power to size myocardial infarcts and estimate both segmental and ventricular function. Experimental studies have also suggested a potential benefit from a combination of reperfusion therapy with selected pharmacologic intervention in reducing infarct size and preserving ventricular function. It seems likely that this general area will remain an intensive area of clinical research in the immediate future.\r"

Several treatment regimens were tested for pityriasis versicolor; the minimum total dose necessary for optimal results was 1 g. A randomized comparison of 50-mg and 100-mg daily doses for the treatment of skin mycoses indicated that the optimal dosage is 100 mg. The results of short courses of treatment for superficial dermatophytoses suggest that such regimens may be effective, and the results of an ongoing double-blind comparison of itraconazole and griseofulvin suggest that itraconazole is superior in these infections. The outcome of treatment of systemic mycoses with itraconazole, especially sporotrichosis, chromomycosis, and aspergillosis, indicates that itraconazole may be useful in therapy for life-threatening fungal infections when standard therapy has failed.\r"

This activity depended largely on the test conditions and the medium used. Ittraconazole was as active as ketoconazole in the treatment of dermatophytoses and of both superficial and deep candidosis at oral doses about eight and four times lower, respectively, than the doses of ketoconazole required. Disseminated dermatophytosis was cured more rapidly by itraconazole than by ketoconazole. Parenteral and oral itraconazole were of equal efficacy for the treatment of systemic candidosis. Itraconazole used topically was more active than reference compounds against microsporosis, trichophytosis, and superficial candidosis. Given orally, itraconazole was effective therapy for aspergillosis and meningo-cerebral cryptococcosis in mice and for generalized cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and sporotrichosis in guinea pigs.

With the exception of P. ovale, primary alterations are seen at the cell periphery and the cytoplasmic vacuoles in which lipid-like vesicles assemble. These changes are usually accompanied by a marked increase in cell volume, impaired cell division, or abortive hyphal outgrowth. The concentration of itraconazole necessary to induce irreversible structural degeneration (necrosis) depends greatly on the species used, the time of incubation, and the morphogenetic form in which the fungus is grown and varies from 10(-10) M (P. brasiliensis) to greater than 10(-6) M (C. albicans). Itraconazole achieves these effects either at a concentration comparable to that required for ketoconazole (C. albicans and C. neoformans); at concentrations 10- to 100-fold lower (P. ovale, T. rubrum, P. brasiliensis), or at concentrations 100-fold lower (A. fumigatus).\r"

In the first group, only amphotericin B (1956) administered systemically is active in numerous deep mycoses. Although toxicity limits the use of amphotericin B, it is still the drug of choice for systemic mycoses. Griseofulvin was the first agent used for oral treatment of dermatophytoses. The introduction of flucytosine began a new era in chemotherapy; however, although flucytosine is orally administered and rapidly distributed, its antifungal activity is limited to cryptococcosis and systemic candidosis. The rapid induction of flucytosine-resistant mutants led to the development of treatment regimens of amphotericin B plus flucytosine. With the development of imidazole derivatives in 1969, a new generation of azole antifungal agents has emerged. Of these, only ketoconazole was orally active. New azole derivatives and triazoles have been synthesized, but only itraconazole has been successful in the treatment of superficial and deep mycoses in humans. Future trends for the development of agents with fungicidal activity, wider spectra, and better distribution are proposed. The association of immunotherapy with antifungal chemotherapy may offer new treatments for fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.\r"

A patient with relapsing histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii) was cleared of the infection; a patient with arthritis of the knee due to Phialophora parasitica did not respond to treatment; four patients with semiinvasive pulmonary aspergillosis improved dramatically and were considered clinically cured; and two patients with aspergilloma improved. The duration of follow-up was one to nine months. Levels of itraconazole in body fluids were measured by a bioassay. Levels of drug in knee fluid were about 30% of the simultaneous levels in plasma. A progressive decrease in the level of itraconazole in plasma occurred in two patients, and a progressive increase in the levels occurred in five patients.\r"

In both mammals and nonmammals, the pathway that leads to fusion of an egg with a single sperm consists of many steps that occur in a compulsory order. These steps include species-specific cellular recognition, intracellular and intercellular membrane fusions, and enzyme-catalyzed modifications of cellular investments. In several instances, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these events during mammalian fertilization are beginning to be revealed.\r"

Two major mechanisms for expression control are DNA inversion and DNA transposition. In DNA inversion a DNA segment flips around and is rejoined by site-specific recombination, disconnecting or connecting a gene to sequences required for its expression. In DNA transposition a gene moves into an expression site where it displaces its predecessor by gene conversion. Gene rearrangements altering gene expression have mainly been found in some unicellular organisms. They allow a fraction of the organisms to preadapt to sudden changes in environment, that is, to alter properties such as surface antigens in the absence of an inducing stimulus. The antigenic variation that helps the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis, gonorrhea, and relapsing fever to elude host defense is controlled in this way.\r"

The splicing of nuclear messenger RNA precursors involves the formation of a multicomponent complex, the spliceosome. This splicing body contains at least three different small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), U2, U5, and U4 + U6. A complex containing precursor RNA and the U2 snRNP particle is a likely intermediate in the formation of the spliceosome.\r"

Antibodies to a 28-amino acid peptide representing the partial protein sequence of the human amyloid filaments recognized the cortical and microvascular amyloid of all of the aged mammals examined. Plaque amyloid, plaque neurites, and neuronal cell bodies in the aged animals showed no reaction with antibodies to human paired helical filaments. Thus, with age, the amyloid proteins associated with progressive cortical degeneration in Alzheimer's disease are also deposited in the brains of other mammals. Aged primates can provide biochemically relevant models for principal features of Alzheimer's disease: cerebrovascular amyloidosis and neuritic plaque formation.\r"

Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, completely reversed chloroquine resistance in two chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum clones from Southeast Asia and Brazil. Verapamil reversed chloroquine resistance at the same concentration (1 X 10(-6)M) as that at which it reversed resistance in multidrug-resistant cultured neoplastic cells. This same concentration of verapamil had no effect on chloroquine-sensitive parasites. Hence, chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum may fit the criteria for the multidrug-resistant phenotype.\r"

They were found to be different from the schizophrenias and the affective disorders. \"Good prognosis\" schizophrenia, which has been extensively studied and reported in the literature, is clinically very similar to schizophreniform disorder. The relatively consistent data collected in patients with good prognosis schizophrenia may provide the basis for the additional diagnostic criteria needed in DSM-III schizophreniform disorder.\r"

These include providing calories at twice the resting energy expenditure, as predicted by the Harris-Benedict equations, for patients with greater than 30 per cent BSAB; protein is provided at 2.5 gm per kg per day based on ideal body weight. It is important to recognize that these are optimal goals, but their attainment must be governed by safety considerations for the patient. It is probably safe to supplement intake with a multivitamin and vitamin C, as well as zinc, but our understanding of micronutrient therapy for stressed patients is rudimentary.\r"

  ".U": "87120723\r", 
  ".W": "The current state of knowledge and experience with early burn wound closure leads to some conclusions that are proved and others that are suggested. The issues that are proved include the following: Small (less than 20 per cent TBSA) full-thickness burns and indeterminate (deep partial-thickness versus full-thickness) burns, if treated by an experienced surgeon, can be excised safely and grafted with a decrease in hospital stay, cost to the patient, and time away from work or school. Early excision and grafting dramatically decreases the number of painful ward debridements required by all patients. Patients with burns between 20 and 40 per cent TBSA appear to have fewer infectious wound complications and a shortened hospital stay if treated with early excision and grafting. In addition to the above conclusions, about which there is little disagreement, there are other suggestive data and clinical impressions that do not yet have \"hard data\" to support them. These issues include the following: Scarring is less in wounds closed early, leading to better appearance and the need for fewer reconstructive procedures. There presently is not a good measure of \"cosmetic appearance,\" and comparative studies await an acceptable scale to measure results. Mortality from wound infection is less in patients with major burns. Because wounds exceeding the donor sites cannot be closed permanently and completely until donor sites can be reharvested, proof will come only when a durable permanent cover can be applied in a timely fashion. Data now suggest that mortality has decreased, but none of the studies has been conclusive. Mortality from other complications of major burns may decrease with early excision and grafting. Decreasing stress, hypermetabolism, and decreasing the overall bacterial load of such patients enables them to resist other complications better. The only present data supporting this conclusion, however, come from animal studies. The current state of the art suggests that small, deep burns can be excised and grafted by general or plastic surgeons in community hospitals as long as they are interested in the procedure and the hospital has the proper support facilities. Burns of cosmetically or functionally important areas (face, hands, feet, and joints) should be excised by someone with a special interest in burns, and burns in excess of 10 per cent TBSA should be excised only in facilities with excellent support facilities, including an experienced anesthesiologist, trained nursing personnel, good critical-care facilities, and a safe blood bank.\r"

Patients presenting with intermittent claudication or ischemic pain at rest were studied to determine the presence or absence of iliac or femoral occlusive disease by assessing the level of PtcO2 measurements at sites above and below the knee. PtcO2 studies were assessed against changes in the arteriogram, the \"gold standard\" for judging peripheral arterial insufficiency. Using our criteria, PtcO2 measurements above the knee show a sensitivity rate of 86 per cent and a specificity rate of 20 per cent to detect iliac disease. PtcO2 measurements below the knee show a sensitivity rate of 91 per cent and a specificity rate of 33 per cent to detect femoral disease. The accuracy was 69 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively. The user of the test is mainly concerned with the \"predictive values\" which are functions of the sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of the disease. Transcutaneous oxygen measurements above and below the knee show a very good sensitivity for detecting iliac and femoral disease, indicating that they may well serve as a quick and convenient noninvasive diagnostic procedure.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred and eighty consecutive renal transplant operations performed upon adults over a ten year period were reviewed to obtain the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or both. Using strict objective diagnostic criteria, 40 (8.3 per cent) thrombotic events were diagnosed, comprising 25 lower limb DVT alone, 11 DVT with PE and four PE alone. Four deaths were directly attributable to PE which was the fourth major cause of death in the review period. DVT was more common on the side of the transplant but the difference was not significant. The low incidence of thrombotic events (1.7 per cent) in the first month of transplantation does not suggest that chemical prophylaxis should be used during this period. However, the peak incidence occurred in the fourth month after transplantation which may be associated with a significant rise in mean hemoglobin concentration in both the thrombotic population and a control group of transplant recipients. Patient age at the time of transplantation and predisposing events, such as prolonged bedrest, further surgical treatment and pelvic pathology, were significant risk factors. All of the patients in the thrombotic population were receiving steroids at the time of diagnosis and no thrombotic events were demonstrated in patients receiving cyclosporin alone. The results of this review suggest that chemical prophylaxis is indicated for patients more than 40 years of age, with stable renal function and receiving steroids, who undergo periods of prolonged bedrest or further surgical treatment at some time after renal transplantation.\r"

The side effects seen in group B were most prominent in the bone marrow, and severe leukopenia occurred. However, in group A leukopenia was suppressed after 2 months. Immunologic parameters, such as the purified protein derivative skin reaction test, did not change, but the streptococcus pyogenes Su-strain polysaccharide skin-reaction test became more positive after therapy in group A.\r"

Moreover, certain models of autoimmune disease have been effectively treated with CsA, and a number of studies have reported encouraging results with CsA therapy for ocular inflammatory disorders, notably Behcet's disease. The most serious side effects of CsA are nephrotoxicity and hypertension; thus, conservative dosages of the drug and careful monitoring of renal function during treatment are recommended. The purpose of this review is to provide clinicians and researchers with a clear perspective of both the potential benefits and shortcomings of this agent.\r"

Pretransplant mean REE was 930 +/- 130 kcal/m2/day versus 920 +/- 190 kcal/m2/day in the posttransplant period (p = NS). Pretransplant mean UUN was 7.7 +/- 3.5 gm/day versus 12.9 +/- 4.4 gm/day in the posttransplant period (p less than 0.05).

Nine of 1,377 patients (7 Asians, 1 Black, 1 Caucasian) from the Cooperative Study of Extracranial/Intracranial Arterial Anastomosis were found to have atherosclerotic bilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk before entering the trial. Three presented with a stroke followed by a contralateral stroke, two experienced a unilateral stroke, two had a unilateral stroke preceded by ipsilateral TIAs, one had a unilateral stroke preceded by TIAs on both sides and one experienced isolated unilateral TIAs. Retrograde filling to the distal MCA was universally present. During follow-up (mean: 45 months), only one (non-operated) patient had further cerebrovascular events, and ultimately a fatal stroke. One additional patient died of sepsis and one had a silent myocardial infarct. All survivors resumed their previous activities. This study shows that in bilateral MCA trunk occlusion, the long-term prognosis is reasonable in the patients who do not present with a devastating stroke.\r"

The study involved all patients entered into the EC/IC Bypass Study with isolated MCA disease or a tandem lesion predominating in the MCA ipsilateral to the ischemic events (18 patients with a tandem lesion of greater magnitude in the internal carotid artery were not included). The Asian patients represented 58% of all Asians entered into the EC/IC Bypass Study, whereas the white patients represented 18% of all whites and the black patients 34% of all blacks. Isolated TIAs were less frequent in MCAO (12%) than in MCAS (34%). Warning TIAs before a stroke occurred in one third of the cases. Presentation with stroke or isolated TIA was not influenced by sex, age, level of MCA obstruction, collateral circulation nor associated carotid disease. In MCAS, no major difference in presentation was found between severe and moderate stenosis. Pure motor hemiparesis occurred in 15% and pure sensory stroke in 2% of the patients with stroke and 30% of the MCA territory infarcts were small and limited to the lenticulocapsular area, confirming that so-called lacunar infarcts may be due to large vessel disease. During follow-up (42 months) of 164 medically-treated patients, further cerebrovascular events (TIA and stroke) occurred in 11.7% of the patients per year. In MCAO the stroke rate was 10.1% per patient-year and the ipsilateral infarct rate was 7.1% per patient-year. In MCAS, the stroke rate was 9.5% per patient-year and the ipsilateral stroke rate was 7.8% per patient-year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The operative mortality was 1.4%; persisting stroke morbidity 3.6% and the combined operative mortality/morbidity 5%. During the follow-up time a further 20 patients (14.5%) died, 13 had new strokes and 14 new TIAs. By life table analysis, the annual rate of stroke including the operative period was 2.7% (1.7% on the operated side and 1.0% on the non-operated side). Fourteen new occlusions (12%) of the operated carotid artery was found and restenosis (greater than 50%) in 13 patients (11.2%). Progression of the atherosclerotic disease in the contralateral non-operated carotid artery was found in 41 patients (37%) including 3 new occlusions. Agreement DSA/duplex was 88% on the operated side and 92% on the non-operated side. New strokes or TIAs on the operated side were more common in patients with occlusions or restenosis (p less than 0.05), whereas no symptoms were referable to occlusions on the non-operated side. Risk factor analysis revealed an increased risk of atherosclerotic progression on the non-operated side in smokers and those with two or more risk factors. The risk of restenosis in the operated carotid artery was higher in females (p less than 0.025).\r"

Cerebral blood flow (CBF), systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, cardiac output, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and arterial and jugular-vein thromboxane B2 (a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2) and 6-keto PGF1 alpha (a stable metabolite of prostacyclin) were measured at baseline, after release of aortic and venae caval occlusion and at intervals up to 120 min thereafter. Treated animals showed nearly complete post-ischemic inhibition of thromboxane B2 production; control animals showed increases in jugular venous thromboxane B2. Arterial and jugular venous levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha were significantly higher in treated animals at most post-ischemic intervals. CBF in both groups was similar to baseline values at time 0, then declined similarly in both groups by 30 min to approximately equal to 35% of baseline values where it remained thereafter. There were no significant differences in other variables at any interval. We conclude that inhibition of thromboxane A2 production does not alter post-ischemic brain hypoperfusion.\r"

Only one randomized study and six non-controlled reports give useful data (this despite more than thirty years of surgical activity in this field). When analyzed by the IMPS (intact months of patient survival) criterion, the randomized study failed to show benefit from surgery. This failure can be attributed to a high (35%) operative stroke and death rate. That sufficiently low operative stroke and death rates are readily achievable is not clear, however, only two of six relevant non-controlled series reported in the literature had operative stroke and death rates below the 10.4% level calculated as necessary for a \"break-even\" situation. Three of the six non-controlled series contain sufficient follow-up data to permit IMPS comparison against the \"standard\" of the control group of the randomized study. Against this \"standard\" only one of the three non-controlled studies would have \"shown benefit\" from surgery. Barnett, Plum, and Walton have called for audits of endarterectomy results in institutions in which such surgery is performed. It is suggested that such audits be done by the IMPS method, which gives appropriate weight to the effects of operative, as well as of long-term follow-up, strokes and deaths.\r"

On the basis of unilateral and bilateral retrograde brachial angiograms in the same patients (a total of 1,989 angiograms) we have developed sonographic criteria for demonstrating a significant increase in the peripheral resistance of both distal vertebral arteries and/or the basilar artery. All 11 cases of basilar artery stenosis of at least 60% reduction in lumen diameter (as shown by angiography) exhibited an approximately 40% or higher reduction in the sum of the modified Pourcelot indices of both vertebral arteries with respect to age-matched controls. All 3 stenoses of less than 60% reduction in lumen diameter were not detected by sonography. Even a good collateral circulation through rete mirabile anastomoses did not normalize the modified Pourcelot indices. One case of a persistent primitive trigeminal artery with thin-calibered vertebral arteries was also detected by sonography. The high percent of patients with one hypoplastic vertebral artery in the group with basilar artery stenoses indicates an increased risk for atherosclerosis of the basilar and/or distal vertebral artery in these patients. All 14 angiographically verified occlusions of the basilar artery were detected by sonographic criteria independent of the occlusion localization. Thus, we believe that directional continuous-wave Doppler sonography is a reliable technique for detecting basilar artery stenoses of at least 60% reduction in lumen diameter and basilar artery occlusions.\r"

We have used the anti-HBc assay in routine screening of voluntary blood donors in San Francisco. The detection rate of anti-HBc was 2.08 percent. The specificity of the antibody test was established by an absorption method using purified HBc antigen (HBcAg) produced by recombinant DNA technology and covalently coupled to Sepharose 4B. Bovine serum albumin was used in the preparation of a control conjugate. The absorption test demonstrated that out of 98 anti-HBc-positive specimens, 97 could be specifically neutralized. Only one specimen was indeterminate. The absorption test was particularly useful in confirming the specificity of EIA in eight specimens inconsistently positive for anti-HBc. We conclude that the current EIA for anti-HBc is highly specific and we are of the opinion that it could be used as a rational basis for donor deferral since it gives evidence of active or previous HBV infection.\r"
