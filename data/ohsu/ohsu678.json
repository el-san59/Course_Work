  ".W": "Sixty patients with variceal bleeding due to noncirrhotic portal fibrosis were treated by repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy. During each session, the varices were injected with a mean volume of 14.4 ml of 1% polidocanol intravariceally. This decreased rebleeding, as evidenced by a reduction in mean bleeding risk factor and transfusion requirement. Difference between pre- and post-sclerotherapy parameters were significant (p less than 0.001). Variceal obliteration was achieved in 53 (88%) patients. The mean sclerotherapy sessions required for eradication were 8.43 (SD = 2.41). Minor complications related to the procedure occurred in 12% of patients. Cumulative survival for 5 yr was 86%. Survival was significantly related to Child's status, being 97.5% for Child's A and 64% for Child's B patients. Recurrence of varices occurred in 15% of patients after a mean interval of 19 months. We conclude that endoscopic sclerotherapy is an effective method of treatment for variceal bleeding due to non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, and is a reasonable alternative to surgery.\r"

The curve had three segments with survival rates of 69% at 2 wk and 46.6% at 12 months. According to Child's grade, the curves were very different at 2 wk, 12 months, and 60 months: Group A, 94.0, 78.0, and 51.8%; group B, 77.0, 46.0, and 32.2; group C, 52.0, 11.0, and 2.3%. The largest differences were observed in the first 2 wk immediately after the first bleeding. The recurrence of bleeding in a period of 6 months significantly decreased the survival. Age, as well as the introduction of prophylactic measures (propranolol or sclerotherapy), did not influence long-term survival. Alcohol abstinence was accompanied by better survival. This difference was due to the impact of abstinence only in group B patients.\r"

Thirty-five patients with mechanical dysphagia underwent subjective estimates of dysphagia using a dysphagia scale graded from 0 to 5, as well as a diet scale. Lumen diameter was measured endoscopically, using the open or closed biopsy forceps as a measuring guide. Patients were then given barium capsules or tablets of increasing diameter under fluoroscopy, in the upright position. Pills were given sequentially until a pill failed to traverse the esophagus in less than 20 s. The diameter of the pill failing to traverse the esophagus within 20 s correlated strongly with the endoscopically measured diameter by Spearmans rank correlation (Rs = 0.85). The weakest correlation was between endoscopically measured diameter and the dysphagia scale (Rs = 0.48). The diameter of the pill failing to traverse the esophagus within 20 s is an excellent estimate of esophageal lumen diameter. Pill size correlates much better with esophageal lumen diameter than dysphagia or diet scales. This new dysphagia assessment system should simplify standardization of the grading of dysphagia.\r"

In patients with Barrett's esophagus, LES pressure was considerably lower and percentage exposure to acid was considerably higher than in either patients with esophagitis or controls (p less than 0.001). Percentage of time with esophageal pH below 4 was 33.2% in patients with Barrett's esophagus, 14% in patients with slight-to-moderate esophagitis (p less than 0.001), and 3.4% in controls (p less than 0.001). In patients with Barrett's esophagus, the esophageal exposure to acid was similar in upright and supine positions, and the number of refluxes that lasted longer than 5 min was also greater in these patients than in uncomplicated esophagitis or controls (p less than 0.001). Accordingly, their acid-clearing capacity was markedly reduced (p less than 0.001 vs. control). Omeprazole 20 mg, given once daily, reduced both percentage of time with pH below 4 (p less than 0.001) and the number of episodes longer than 5 min (p less than 0.001), but had no effect on acid clearance. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, omeprazole lowered intragastric acidity by 77.8% (p less than 0.001). Median intragastric pH was 1.9 (1.7-2.1) pretreatment, and 4.5 (4.2-5) during omeprazole (p less than 0.001).\r"

To define further the role of these factors in ulcer disease, one hundred seven subjects presenting for endoscopy were tested for specific IgG and IgA antibodies to C. pylori, and questioned about nonsteroidal use and smoking. Sixty were dyspeptic patients, 28 were disease controls, and 19 were healthy asymptomatic volunteers. Considering all subjects, 81% (87/107) were either taking nonsteroidals or had antibody to C. pylori, and 32% of these (28/87) had an ulcer. Nineteen percent (20/107) were neither taking nonsteroidals nor had antibody to C. pylori, and none of these had an ulcer, p less than 0.01. Smokers, 41% (11/27), were more likely to have an ulcer than nonsmokers, 20% (16/80), p less than 0.05, but only because of the increased prevalence of ulcers in smokers who also had C. pylori, 73% (11/15) versus 27% (12/45) of nonsmokers with C. pylori, p less than 0.01. The use of nonsteroidals and antibody to C. pylori identify people at risk for ulcers. Smoking increases this risk in subjects with C. pylori. Absence of a history of nonsteroidal use and antibody to C. pylori identify individuals with a low probability of ulcer disease.\r"

  ".W": "Infection by Campylobacter pylori appears to play a major role in the etiology of gastric disease, but the nature of impairment evoked by this pathogen in gastric mucosal defense is not well understood. We present here evidence that the extracellular material elaborated by this microorganism exhibits lipolytic activity capable of gastric mucosal lipid degradation. The colonies of bacteria, cultured from antral mucosal biopsy specimens of patients undergoing endoscopy, were washed with saline, passed through a sterilization filter, and the filtrate was examined for lipase and phospholipase activities. By following the degradation of glycerol trioleate and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, we established the presence of lipase and phospholipase A enzymes. The major product of the triglyceride degradation was glycerol monooleate, while lysophosphatidylcholine resulted from the degradation of phosphatidylcholine. The lipolytic activity of C. pylori filtrate was inhibited by an antiulcer drug, De-Nol, which at 150 micrograms/ml caused a 21% reduction in lipase activity and a 60% reduction in the activity of phospholipase A. The results suggest that De-Nol is capable of preventing degradation of mucosal lipids by C. pylori lipases and, hence, helps to preserve the mucosal integrity.\r"

  ".W": "A multichannel tube with two occluding balloons was developed for measurements of the secretion of different endogenous substances into a defined segment of the small intestine. The tube was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance with the aid of a guide wire and was in position in the proximal jejunum after 45-90 min. The overall success rate of the complete procedure was 90%. The system prevented contamination of the perfusate from gastric and pancreatic secretion. Major dilution of the intestinal secretion was avoided due to high recovery of the perfusion fluid. The jejunal secretion rates of high and low molecular weight substances, i.e., albumin, beta 2-microglobulin, hyaluronan, and histamine, were tested. The recovery of the effluent fluid and the volume marker 14C-PEG 4000 exceeded 95% and was also stable over the perfusion period. The mean secretion rates in 23 healthy controls of albumin (635 micrograms/cm/h), beta 2-microglobulin (0.87 microgram/cm/h), hyaluronan (1061 ng/cm/h), and histamine (70 ng/cm/h) were also stable during the perfusion period. Ten healthy controls were studied under steady state conditions for 3 h. The concentrations in jejunal perfusion fluid relative to serum levels were for albumin 0.06%, indicating the degree of passive leakage from the plasma compartment to the intestinal lumen. The appearance of the low-molecular weight protein beta 2-microglobulin in perfusion fluid was on average 3% of its circulating levels, suggesting that the concentrative transport from plasma is dependent on the molecular size. The jejunal fluid concentrations of histamine and hyaluronan exceeded their respective concentrations in plasma, indicating that local intestinal secretion/synthesis is mainly responsible for their appearance in jejunal fluid. In summary, the technique is simple, rapid, atraumatic, safe, and reproducible and, potentially, can accurately reflect biochemical processes in the small intestine.\r"

At baseline, weight loss was present in 98%, hypoalbuminemia (less than 3.5 g/dl) was present in 83%, and gastrointestinal symptoms included pharyngitis (54%), diarrhea (42%), nausea (23%), dysphagia (21%), and anorexia (18%). Both the magnitude of body weight loss and the serum albumin level were strongly associated with life-table analysis of survival. For weight loss, median survival of 520 vs. 48 days occurred in patients with less than 10% versus greater than 20% baseline weight loss, respectively (p less than 0.01). The substantial influence of serum albumin on survival is outlined below. (table; see text) In almost all cases, serial evaluation demonstrated progressive linear decrease in body weight and albumin. In patients with normal baseline albumin, the rate of 0.7 mg/dl albumin decrease per day was less than half that in patients with baseline hypoalbuminemia. A projected \"time to develop an albumin level less than 2.5 g/dl\" was calculated for patient groups based on initial albumin level and the rate of albumin decrease. The calculated interval was similar to the actual median survival time observed in these groups. We conclude that 1) nutritional status may represent a major determinant of survival in AIDS and 2) the rate of albumin decrease may define a function limiting survival of individual patients with AIDS.\r"

The diagnosis has traditionally been made by barium esophagram. Therapy is conservative; a favorable prognosis is the rule. The pathogenesis is in dispute. We present a case of SIHE without a discernible mucosal breach, suggesting a primary intramural bleed as the initiating event.

Pulse-chase studies with 14C-glutamine as well as studies with various metabolic inhibitors of the ammoniagenic pathways suggest that glutamine in LLC-PK1 cells is metabolized via mitochondrial pathway and that intramitochondrial phosphate-dependent glutaminase pathway plays a predominant role in the regulation of ammoniagenesis to acute acidosis. Furthermore, the measurements of intracellular pH under both basal and acute low pH conditions resulted in the estimation of intracellular pH, which paralleled the alterations in media pH. Therefore, a change in intracellular pH appears to act as a direct signal for alterations in ammonia metabolism in LLC-PK1 cells. Thus, LLC-PK1 cultures provide an excellent model system to investigate renal ammoniagenesis and the intracellular signals that modulate this process.\r"

The activity of alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase was markedly stimulated by acidification of the medium that decreased abruptly the km for alphaketoglutarate. By contrast, succinyl CoA synthetase and malate dehydrogenase remained relatively insensitive to pH changes. The apparent km of malic enzyme for malate was markedly decreased by an acid medium. Therefore these findings suggest that an acid pH regulates the ammoniagenic pathway at two critical sites: alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme. These stimulated enzymatic activities may account for the changes in renal cortical concentrations of metabolites observed during metabolic or respiratory acidosis.\r"

  ".W": "The amino acid glutamine serves as a major fuel, powering tubular transport processes and base generation in the kidneys of acidotic animals. Removing the adrenals limits the kidneys' response to an exogenous acid load and impairs the removal rate of glutamine from the blood. Administering glucocorticoid to adrenalectomized (ADX) rats reverses a small net release of glutamine to uptake; similarly, administering an exogenous acid load to ADX rats restores the kidneys to organs of net extraction. Glucocorticoid-induced uptake is substantially less than the filtered glutamine load in contrast to uptake across both the luminal and basolateral surfaces when filtered HCO3- is reduced. Furthermore, mitochondrial glutamine oxidation is glucocorticoid dependent with a distinct impairment exhibited by the ADX acidotic rat kidney. However, combining the effect of reduced filtered HCO3- with glucocorticoid supplementation results in a marked potentiation of glutamine uptake coupled to oxidation. These results are consistent with a proposed proximal tubule cell model in which basolateral glutamine uptake is inversely related to basolateral HCO3- efflux and coupled, in the presence of glucocorticoid, to mitochondrial oxidation. This model of glucocorticoid-induced ammoniagenesis predicts an increased renal work capacity when basolateral transport of a major metabolic fuel, glutamine, is closely coupled to its oxidative metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "In isolated rabbit cortical renal tubules, phosphate transport rates change in response to the metabolic demands for inorganic phosphate. The mechanisms involved in this association may be related to changes in cytosolic concentration of inorganic phosphate. The present studies were designed to manipulate mitochondrial metabolism and to measure the rate of phosphate transport under these conditions. The measured change in rates of oxidative phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions was used to calculate the effects on the cytosolic concentration of inorganic phosphate. First, malate (1 mmol/L) was added to suspensions of rabbit cortical renal tubules to stimulate oxidative phosphorylation. This addition was associated with an increase in both oxidative phosphorylation and ouabain-sensitive dephosphorylation, but the effect on phosphorylation was greater and the calculated demand for cytosolic phosphate was increased. Under these conditions, isolated, perfused proximal convoluted tubules absorbed phosphate at a faster rate (6.9 +/- 1.6 v 4.9 +/- 1.0 pmol/mm/min; P less than 0.05). Second, n-butylmalonate (5 mmol/L) was added to suspensions of tubules to partially inhibit mitochondrial transport of anions and oxidative phosphorylation. This manipulation was associated with an equivalent decrease in both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates and no change in the demand for cytosolic phosphate. In perfused proximal convoluted tubules, fluid absorption was reduced but the phosphate transport rate was unchanged (5.3 +/- 1.2 v 4.4 +/- 0.9 pmol/mm/min). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that alterations in the cytosolic demand for inorganic phosphate participate in the regulation of the phosphate transport mechanism of proximal convoluted tubules.\r"

  ".W": "Proximal tubular ammoniagenesis is amplified under conditions of acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Current hypotheses postulate that alterations in intracellular pH (pHi) or in the pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (delta pHm) influence mitochondrial glutamine metabolism. Enhanced glutamine transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane might constitute a key regulatory factor in acidosis. To examine changes in delta pHm, a technique was used to determine pHi and intramitochondrial pH (pHm) simultaneously. Regulation of the enzyme alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha KGDH) was assessed by evaluating enzyme activity at varied levels of medium pH, Ca++, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The results indicate that pHi decreased with an acid external pH. A fall in pHi correlated to increase activity of alpha KGDH associated with increased affinity for the substrate, alpha KG. Increments in either buffer Ca++ or ADP concentration increased enzyme affinity for alpha KG at pH 7.6 but not at pH 6.8. These results, compatible with previous reports, indicate that pH, Ca++, and ADP are effectors of the enzyme alpha KGDH. Alterations in pH across the inner mitochondrial membrane might augment flux through alpha KG by accelerating glutamine metabolism. Increased alpha KG oxidation over the range of 10 to 500 mumol/L Ca++ concentration is compatable with data for Ca++ regulation reported for the solubilized enzyme. These studies provide evidence that the above factors, through enhancing alpha KGDH activity, participate in regulation of ammoniagenesis during states of acidosis.\r"

Compared with cortex, medulla showed greater rates of formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from P-creatine, of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from 2-deoxyglucose, and of total adenine nucleotides from IMP. These results suggest that the purine nucleotide cycle is more active in medulla than in cortex.

  ".W": "The reabsorption of amino acids by the proximal tubule is remarkably efficient. Current evidence indicates that this process occurs by Na+-amino acid cotransport or symport. The energy for amino acid entry is derived from the chemical and voltage gradient for Na+ entry across the apical surface of the renal cell maintained by pumping Na+ out of the cell by Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity at the basolateral membrane. We chose the beta-amino acid taurine to study the anionic requirements as well as voltage- and pH-dependence of Na+-taurine symport into rat proximal tubule brush border membrane vesicles. Maximal uptake was found when Cl- or Br- were the anions. The addition of various ionophores (amiloride, carbonyl cyanide-n chlorophenyl-hydrazone, and valinomycin) under pH-equilibrated conditions did not change taurine entry into the vesicle. Hill equation analysis of the initial rate of taurine uptake into vesicles indicates that transport operates by means of a 2 Na+:1 Cl-:1 taurine-carrier complex. Because taurine is a zwitterion, this complex has a net positive charge. Its entry into the vesicle is favored by the imposition of an outwardly directed K+ gradient in the presence of valinomycin. The movement of a quaternary complex of this type across the apical surface of the proximal tubular cell would assure that the movement of both Cl- and the amino acid is energized by the Na+ gradient. Because most amino acids are zwitterions at physiologic pH this complex would be positively charged, favoring entry into the voltage negative renal cell interior.\r"

  ".W": "In certain thrombotic states, large declines in the levels of functional circulating antithrombin occur, which may reflect the highly active nature of the endothelial surface in suppressing excessive amounts of activated coagulation enzymes. Alternatively, we have recently observed an unexpected and paradoxical in vitro functioning of heparin that could result in the inactivation of antithrombin in pathologic conditions. Specifically, antithrombin was rendered nonfunctional as an inhibitor of clotting enzymes as a result of a limited, heparin-dependent cleavage by neutrophil elastase. This inactivation occurred only in the presence of the active anticoagulant heparin fraction, which suggested that the heparin-antithrombin complex was the substrate for elastase attack. Interestingly, neutrophil elastase was found to bind tightly to heparin and heparin-like materials. Neutrophil elastase has been previously linked to nonspecific proteinolysis occurring in inflammatory thrombotic reactions. This affinity of both antithrombin and elastase for heparin suggests a novel mechanism of potential specificity. An important component of this hypothesis is the localization of the elastase/antithrombin reaction away from the high circulating levels of elastase inhibitors. The proposed inactivation of antithrombin on the vascular surface would likely occur only in pathologic states associated with neutrophil sequestration and activation. Nevertheless, this mechanism could lead to a localized reversal of the nonthrombogenic nature of the endothelium and potentially lead to significant reductions of functional antithrombin in certain disease states.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Echocardiography has become a widely utilized test since its introduction into clinical medicine in the early 1970s. Although it has frequently been performed in patients suspected of having mitral valve prolapse (MVP), its usefulness in this setting has not been systematically studied. To investigate the use and value of echocardiography in patients suspected of having MVP, we conducted a prospective study in which physicians were interviewed before and after ordering echocardiographic testing for patients in whom there was a suspicion of MVP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included consecutive patients referred to the echocardiography laboratory at Boston University Medical Center because of suspected MVP between January 1 and December 31, 1987. Two standardized telephone interviews were conducted with the physician most responsible for ordering the echocardiogram. The following information was obtained during the first interview, which was always conducted before the echocardiogram was performed: patient demographic and clinical data; the reason for ordering the echocardiogram; the physician's most likely clinical diagnosis; the physician's estimate of the likelihood that the patient had MVP; and the physician's proposed management plans. After the referring physician received the echocardiographic results, a second interview was conducted to determine changes in the most likely clinical diagnosis and management plans. The impact of the echocardiogram on diagnosis and management was evaluated by comparing physician responses before and after reception of echocardiographic results. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the physician's skills at distinguishing patients with echocardiographic-documented MVP from those without MVP. RESULTS: A total of 106 echocardiograms were ordered by 45 different physicians. More than 80% of all echocardiograms were ordered to address diagnostic or therapeutic concerns. On echocardiography, 47 (44%) patients were found to have MVP, six (6%) had mitral regurgitation without prolapse, and 53 (50%) had normal results. On the basis of the ROC curve analysis, the physician's ability to discriminate between patients with and without echocardiographic MVP varied significantly by physician specialty and practice setting. The echocardiographic results led to a change in diagnosis in 59 (56%) patients. A change in management occurred in 29 (27%) patients, with 25 of these 29 changes (86%) related to the initiation or discontinuation of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography frequently alters diagnostic assessments and leads to therapeutic changes in some patients suspected of having MVP. However, the benefits of such changes have not yet been demonstrated.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The sensitivity of electrocardiographic indicators of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is known to be rather poor. To date, no study has undertaken a comparison of the various electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). In this study, we compared the sensitivity of the total 12-lead QRS amplitude with the sensitivity of certain standard electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy in necropsy patients with HC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 hearts were studied. The last technically satisfactory electrocardiogram available from each necropsy patient was used. Electrocardiographic criteria employed to diagnose LV hypertrophy included the Sokolow and Lyon index, the Romhilt-Estes voltage criteria, the Romhilt-Estes point score, the ratio of RV6:RV5 greater than 1 proposed by Holt and Spodick, and a method utilizing the sum of the amplitudes of the QRS complexes of all 12 leads. RESULTS: The total 12-lead QRS amplitude ranged from 66 to 339 mm (mean: 197 mm) (10 mm = 1 mV). Using 175 mm as the upper limit of normal, this technique yielded a sensitivity of 53%, which was the highest sensitivity of any criteria tested. The Sokolow-Lyon index had a sensitivity of 39%; the Romhilt-Estes voltage criteria, 37%; the Romhilt-Estes point score system, 49%; and the criterion of RV6 more than RV5, 39%. No correlation was found between total 12-lead QRS voltage and heart weight, LV free wall thickness, LV peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures, or LV outflow tract peak systolic pressure gradient. The 10 patients (18%) with transmural LV scars had significantly lower total 12-lead QRS voltage than did the 48 patients (78%) without such scars (155 mm versus 205 mm, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Total 12-lead QRS amplitude more than 175 mm is a useful indicator of LV hypertrophy and, among patients with HC, it is more sensitive than other more commonly employed criteria.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Cardiomyopathy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, or autonomic neuropathy may affect the cardiovascular performance of the diabetic patient. To evaluate the role of parasympathetic nervous system activity on cardiovascular performance, 25 diabetic subjects who lacked symptoms, signs, or objective measurements of ischemia or cardiomyopathy were studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diabetic subjects were classified according to their RR variation, an index of cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity. Fourteen diabetic subjects had a normal RR variation of greater than 30 (D-NOR), and 11 diabetic patients had an abnormal RR variation of less than 20 (D-ABN). Fifteen age- and weight-matched, healthy, nondiabetic subjects (NOR) constituted the control group. All subjects had oxygen consumption, multigated acquisition determination of cardiac output, and work product measured before and during supine bicycle maximum exercise testing. RESULTS: There was no difference in the resting cardiac output among the groups. Resting work product, however, was greatest in the D-ABN group when compared with performance in the other two groups (D-ABN: 11,500 +/- 800; D-NOR: 9,000 +/- 600; NOR: 8,700 +/- 400; p less than 0.0025). This was due to an increase in both heart rate (p less than 0.025) and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.015). In the diabetic subjects, there was an inverse relationship between the RR variation and resting work product (r = 0.47, n = 25, p less than 0.005). In response to exercise, the percent increase in cardiac output at matched percent maximum oxygen uptake was greatest in the NOR, D-NOR, and D-ABN groups, respectively (analysis of variance, p less than 0.01). In the diabetic subjects, there was a significant relationship between the RR variation and the maximum percent change in cardiac output (r = 0.41, n = 25, p less than 0.02). Compared with the NOR group, the maximum increase in work product was impaired in diabetic subjects (p less than 0.002) and not different between the D-NOR and D-ABN groups. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in resting work product and the poor cardiac output responses to exercise in the D-ABN group are due to a decrease in cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity and can be suggested by an abnormal RR variation. This index of parasympathetic nervous system activity can help the physician identify that subset of diabetic patients that may need special consideration when exercise training is prescribed.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been described to have an unusual form of renal disease known as HIV-associated nephropathy. This condition is characterized by severe proteinuria, rapid progression to renal insufficiency, and a morphologic pattern of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on renal biopsy. Despite increasing awareness of this entity, the epidemiology and clinical course of HIV-associated nephropathy are not yet well defined. We therefore decided to study HIV-infected patients with this biopsy-proven pattern of focal sclerosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using life-table analysis, we evaluated the clinical features and course of 26 patients with HIV infection and biopsy-proven FSGS and compared them with those in 24 subjects with HIV infection who had no glomerular disease at autopsy. RESULTS: The group with FSGS had a higher percentage of blacks (96% versus 46%) and intravenous drug abusers (42% versus 17%), and had a higher mean serum creatinine level (5.4 mg/dL versus 1.0 mg/dL) than the group of HIV-infected subjects without glomerular disease. At the time of diagnosis of FSGS, six patients had clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), eight had AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 12 patients had no evidence of AIDS or ARC. The progression to end-stage renal disease for all patients was rapid, with a median time to dialysis of 10.9 weeks. Duration of patient survival was dependent upon the stage of HIV infection at the time of diagnosis of renal disease. Patients who presented with AIDS had a median survival of 1.9 months, compared to a median survival of 3.6 months for those with ARC and 9.7 months for initially asymptomatic HIV carriers (p less than 0.05). Fifteen patients either presented with or developed AIDS during the course of the study, and all died as a consequence of their immunodeficiency. Survival curves from the diagnosis of AIDS to death were similar in the group with HIV-associated nephropathy (7.3 weeks) compared to the control AIDS group without renal disease (6.9 weeks). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that FSGS associated with HIV infection can occur before other manifestations of AIDS, is more common in blacks and in intravenous drug abusers, and is rapidly progressive to uremia. Patient survival is dependent upon the stage of HIV infection. These findings may prove useful in devising more effective strategies for the care of this growing patient population.\r"

We investigated Histoplasma capsulatum polysaccharide antigen (HPA) detection, a promising new method for rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one cases of disseminated histoplasmosis in patients with AIDS form the basis of this report. Control cases were patients with AIDS who had other opportunistic infections and whose cultures were negative for H. capsulatum. A slightly modified radioimmunoassay procedure was used to measure the levels of HPA in urine and blood specimens. RESULTS: High levels of HPA were detected in the urine of 59 of 61 (96.7%) and the blood of 37 of 47 (78.7%) patients with AIDS complicated by disseminated histoplasmosis. Treatment with amphotericin B reduced levels of HPA in the urine in 19 of 21 (90.5%) and the serum of all 10 patients tested. HPA levels increased in the urine in all eight and in the serum in all five patients with culture-proven relapse. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, HPA detection offers a rapid method for diagnosing disseminated histoplasmosis. Additional experience is required to establish the role of this test in monitoring the effects of treatment and in identifying relapse in patients with AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "90023525\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: Pulmonary infection is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the predominant infection in these patients. In those patients who experience progression to respiratory failure from PCP, the reported mortality rate has been between 87% to 100%. This, in addition to the ultimately fatal outcome of patients with AIDS, has led many physicians to question the advisability of instituting mechanical support for respiratory failure in the setting of PCP. It had been our impression that the outcome of patients on our service was not as poor as was generally reported. We therefore undertook a retrospective analysis of our clinical experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical course of patients admitted to our service between December 1984 and June 1988 who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for PCP or presumed PCP. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were identified with 18 survivors (54.5%) and 15 non-survivors (45.5%). Twenty-five of the 33 patients were intubated for their first episode of PCP, with 16 survivors (64%), whereas the remaining eight patients were intubated for their second episode of PCP, with two survivors (25%). We were not able to identify any parameters that predicted survival, although the serum lactate dehydrogenase level was useful in following the response to treatment. CONCLUSION: It is our belief that there is a reasonable chance of survival for patients requiring mechanical ventilation for PCP. We question the wisdom of avoiding intubation and mechanical ventilation altogether in patients with PCP due to the presumption of fatality in this clinical situation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Previous studies had reported that normal individuals do not have measurable levels of interferons in their circulation, whereas high levels have been found in patients in the early stages of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and in those with AIDS-related complex (ARC). This study was undertaken to compare levels of interferon and interferon inhibitors in plasma samples from patients with AIDS, ARC, Kaposi's sarcoma, or varicella-zoster virus infection, and from control subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 206 persons were tested for the presence of interferon and interferon inhibitors in their plasma: 76 with ARC or AIDS, with or without Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma; 32 with varicella-zoster infection; 12 with AIDS-unrelated Kaposi's sarcoma; and 86 normal control subjects at high or low risk of AIDS with or without positive antibody levels to human immunodeficiency virus-1. Total interferon activity was measured by bioassay and the subtypes were not separated. RESULTS: Of 86 normal control subjects, 85 had no significant levels of interferon or interferon inhibitor. One disease-free homosexual exhibited measurable interferon levels. Patients acutely infected with varicella-zoster virus showed no measurable interferon or inhibitor levels except if they were in a high-risk group for AIDS. Seventy-six patients with ARC or AIDS exhibited measurable circulating interferon levels. Only patients with AIDS had interferon inhibitors in their circulation. Of 12 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma unrelated to AIDS, none had measurable interferon inhibitor levels, but some exhibited measurable interferon levels. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that levels of interferon inhibitor should be considered when interferon is used therapeutically in viral or neoplastic diseases.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We recently noticed the occurrence of both livedo and elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels in a small number of patients with lupus. The purpose of our study was two-fold: (1) to investigate whether anticardiolipin antibodies were more common in lupus patients with livedo than in those without; and (2) to determine if the features of Sneddon's syndrome (livedo and cerebrovascular disease) also were found in patients with lupus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case-control study of lupus patients without significant renal impairment, 29 patients with livedo reticularis (cases) were compared clinically and immunologically with 29 patients without livedo (controls). RESULTS: Both groups shared many disease characteristics and were similar in age and sex. However, they differed markedly in other respects. Elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels were significantly more common in the cases. Indeed, 81% of all cases from our study sample had elevated anticardiolipin levels. A history of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia--clinical associates of the anticardiolipin antibody--was also significantly more common in cases than in controls. The relative odds of livedo reticularis were 23-fold greater in those with elevated anticardiolipin levels than in those without these antibodies. The estimated proportion of livedo-positive patients with elevated anticardiolipin antibodies in a general lupus population without significant renal impairment was 0.77. CONCLUSION: The association between livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular disease, originally described by Sneddon in otherwise healthy individuals, also applies to lupus patients. The presence of elevated anticardiolipin antibody levels in 10 of 11 such patients suggests that the anticardiolipin antibody may be of pathogenetic importance in the manifestations of Sneddon's syndrome in lupus and also possibly in the idiopathic form of this disease.\r"

The drug has now been given to over 1,800 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia for periods of up to two years. In the range of dosage from 10 to 40 mg once daily, therapy is associated with reductions of up to 30 percent in total cholesterol and 40 percent in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as with increases of approximately 10 percent in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The most common clinical adverse experiences are mild gastrointestinal effects and headache, which seldom require discontinuation of therapy. Elevations of creatine kinase (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) levels to more than three times the upper limit of the normal range have been seen in about 3 percent of patients, but also have seldom required discontinuation of therapy. Conversely, elevations of hepatic transaminase levels to more than three times the upper limit of the laboratory normal range have been seen in about 1.5 percent of patients and have caused discontinuation of therapy in 0.6 percent of patients treated. Simvastatin appears to be an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and, as further study confirms long-term safety and efficacy, it should become a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.\r"

Using this technique, abnormalities can be detected in circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Functional lymphocyte LDL receptor activity was decreased in patients with heterozygous FH. Following treatment with the specific inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, lovastatin, alone or in combination with a bile acid-binding resin, there was increased expression of functional lymphocyte LDL receptors in five of nine patients. Plasma LDL cholesterol levels decreased in all nine patients. Three other patients who were only studied while receiving therapy also manifested increased expression of functional lymphocyte LDL receptors. The degree of improvement in plasma LDL cholesterol did not predict the effect on lymphocyte LDL receptor function. Longitudinal studies indicated that an increase in functional LDL receptor activity could be observed with 4 weeks of therapy and persisted for at least 18 months on continuous treatment. These results provide direct evidence that therapy with lovastatin and a bile acid-binding resin can lead to increased expression of functional LDL receptors by lymphocytes in the majority (eight of 12) of patients with heterozygous FH.\r"

Left ventricular (LV) function curves (stroke volume vs. end-diastolic volume) were plotted from data generated before and after large variations in cardiac preload. Increase in preload was produced by five degrees of head-down tilt for 90 minutes; decrease in preload was produced by graduated lower body negative pressure to -40 mmHg. After incomplete autonomic blockade, the negative inotropic effects of acute alcohol ingestion were minimal but significant and manifest by the reduction in mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (p less than 0.05). Studies during wide variations in preload confirmed the importance of maintaining central blood volume after alcohol ingestion. Lower body negative pressure after both incomplete autonomic blockade and alcohol produced a further deterioration in mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (p less than 0.05).\r"

The authors found at least two types of specific-binding sites for this compound in the mononuclear leukocytes. The first type of sites (receptor content [Ro], 10.8 +/- 1.6 fmoles/10(6) cells [mean +/- SD of 4 experiments]; equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), 0.3 +/- 0.1 nM) have a capacity similar to that of the dexamethasone binding site (Ro, 11.2 fmoles/10(6) cells; Kd, 1.2 nM). The second type of sites (Ro, 56 +/- 27 fmoles/10(6) cells: Kd, 19 +/- 5 nM) have a higher capacity and lower affinity for RU 486 than the first type of sites and do not interact with dexamethasone. The authors were unable to demonstrate the presence of the second type of binding sites in subcellular fractions. This finding suggests that this site is unstable and lost in the fractionation process. The role of the second type of low-affinity, high-capacity RU 486 specific-binding site in intact human mononuclear leukocytes, as well as its possible occurrence in other tissue, requires further investigation.\r"

It has not been demonstrated, however, whether this agent is of benefit when hypercholesterolemia is induced in animals by means other than the feeding of a high-fat diet. In this study, hypercholesterolemia was produced in rabbits by feeding a low-fat, cholesterol-free diet with dietary protein supplied by casein for a period of 8 weeks. Controls were given this diet without poloxalene and experimentals were given the diet with poloxalene. Total serum cholesterol levels increased in both groups, but the rise was greater for the control group. Lipoprotein analysis performed at the conclusion of the study showed significantly greater low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in the control group as compared to the experimental group. Total protein and apolipoprotein B (apo B) were also greater in control LDL. It was concluded that poloxalene favorably affects this model of hypercholesterolemia as total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and LDL apo B were all less and the HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol ratio was higher in surfactant-treated rabbits.\r"

A 17-year-old girl developed hypoparathyroidism following partial thyroidectomy for thyrotoxicosis. Hypocalcemia was refractory to treatment with massive doses of vitamin D2, up to 150,000 U, 3-6 gm of oral Ca as CaCO3 and 2 micrograms of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol per day. Intravenous Ca gluconate (360 mg of elemental Ca/d, in divided doses) was needed to correct tetany. After 25 days of unsuccessful therapy, oral administration of 30 ml of a 10% solution of CaCl2 (1.09 gm of elemental Ca) was followed by normalization of serum Ca (8.9 mg/dl) within 7 hours. This dose was repeated every 8 hours for 6 days and oral CaCO3 and IV Ca gluconate were discontinued. Serum Ca remained within normal range but hyperchloremic acidosis developed. This was corrected by providing, in addition to vitamin D, 2 g/d of Ca supplementation, 1 gm in the form of 10% CaCl2 solution and 1 gm as CaCO3 in two doses given simultaneously. During 12 months of observation, serum Ca, P and Cl have been consistently within normal limits. This patient was found to have achlorhydria, unresponsive to normalization of thyroid function and serum Ca. These findings indicate that refractoriness to oral CaCO3 and vitamin D may be caused by achlorhydria. Oral administration of CaCl2 solution can promptly correct this defect. Monitoring of serum Cl and CO2 is needed to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis.\r"

The authors present a patient with AIDS who had disseminated toxoplasmosis whose initial clinical presentation was symptomatic orchitis and the nephrotic syndrome (NS). Testicular involvement with toxoplasmosis has been described only rarely, predominantly as an incidental finding at autopsy. Toxoplasmosis is a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome, with the majority of cases associated with congenital infection. In this case, the nephrotic syndrome remitted only after orchiectomy and chemotherapy for toxoplasmosis, but recurred when the patient had a relapse of his CNS disease. Toxoplasmosis in AIDS may present with extra-neural manifestations and may be an etiologic agent for NS in some patients with AIDS.\r"

Nevertheless, there are no previously reported cases of hematemesis temporally associated with nicotinic acid use. The authors report the case of a previously healthy 20-year-old man who developed hematemesis and hepatitis 1 week after self-initiating the daily consumption of 6 g of nicotinic acid. Supportive therapy and discontinuing nicotinic acid resulted in rapid clinical improvement in this patient. The clinical circumstances suggest a possible causal relationship between nicotinic acid consumption and his presenting problems. The use of large doses of nicotinic acid may be rapidly complicated by hematemesis and hepatitis.\r"

This investigation examines the role of more severe hyperglycemia in altering the ventricular fibrillation threshold and how the sympathetic nervous system modulates the response. Alloxan diabetes was induced in eight male mongrel dogs 3-5 years of age (Group 2), for comparison with matched controls (Group 1). Hemoglobin A1c rose from 2.9 +/- .4-7.8 +/- .3% and body weight was maintained with daily insulin. After 1 year, anesthesia was induced with chloralose and an electrode catheter placed at the right ventricular apex. VFT was 41.7 +/- 1.8 ma in Group 1 and 27.8 +/- 2.1 ma in the diabetics of Group 2 (p less than .001). There was significantly greater decline of VFT in response to epinephrine infusion in Group 2. The threshold in diabetics rose to normal levels after infusion of the beta-blocking agent, esmolol. Subsequently, the response of the cardiac sympathetic system was assessed during ventricular pacing at 200 beats/minute. Serial paired blood samples were taken from catheters in the aorta and coronary sinus for catecholamine assay by HPLC. Both groups had similar coronary blood flow responses by the thermal method, as well as changes in arterial pressure. While no change occurred in Group 1, a progressive rise of norepinephrine (NE) concentration was observed in coronary venous effluent of Group 2 (p less than .01). The basal arterial-coronary sinus difference was-123 +/- 52 pg/ml, which rose during pacing in Group 2 to a peak of -376 +/- 9.3 pg/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To minimize side effects, the authors tried a very low dose (50 mg/day) regimen which has not been used in any other disease and observed its efficacy in ITP. Fifteen patients were given this dosage of danazol. Its effects on T-cell subsets, B cells, and blastogenic response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) were studied before and during therapy. The percentage of CD3 and the percentage and numbers of CD4 were significantly increased during therapy. Responses to PWM, a T-cell dependent B cell mitogen, were also significantly elevated during therapy. However, no change in the percentage of B (CD19) lymphocytes and response to Staph A, a polyclonal B cell mitogen, were noted. There were seven excellent-good and eight fair-poor responses in platelet counts. The excellent-good responders were found to have a more stable CD4 subset between before and during therapy compared to the fair-poor responders (p less than 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Very low dose danazol regimen, therefore, produced a significant increase in the CD4 without affecting the B cells. However, the excellent-good responder patients showed no significant increase in the CD4 lymphocytes.\r"

The diagnosis is made by assessment of endometrial biopsy specimens. Measurement of serum progesterone offers a less invasive alternative, but its utility as a diagnostic test is limited since there is no agreement on the level that will accurately differentiate between normal and luteal phase deficiency cycles. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an optimal time in the menstrual cycle when serum progesterone measurement could improve the diagnostic accuracy of the test. The results demonstrate that this time period is day 25 to day 26 and not the midluteal phase as has previously been suggested. The discriminatory level was found to be 21 nmol/L and provided a test with sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 73%.\r"

Agreement among observers is low for diastolic blood pressure. The clinic staff measured about 50% of the values with a zero terminal digit as compared with only 14% by the project coordinator. The fourth Korotkoff sound can be recorded in 83% of the patients. The mean diastolic blood pressures obtained with the fourth sound are significantly higher than when the fifth sound is used. Recommendations are offered for blood pressure measuring during pregnancy, and it is strongly suggested that the same methodologic rigor be used as in any other medical procedure.\r"

Although they are also effective tocolytic agents, fetal effects have not been fully studied. Fifteen chronically catheterized near-term ewes were studied. Maternal and fetal cardiorespiratory parameters were measured in the control period and again 15 minutes after maternal venous infusion of angiotensin II. Nicardipine 20 micrograms/kg/min was given over 2 minutes and maternal and fetal cardiorespiratory parameters and fetal blood flow were measured 5.30 and 60 minutes later. Nicardipine reversed maternal hypertension and produced transient tachycardia. Fetuses responded initially with transient bradycardia and then developed hypercapnia and acidemia (p less than 0.03) by 60 minutes after nicardipine. Fetal placental blood flow decreased and vascular resistance increased by 5 minutes after nicardipine but returned toward control values after 30 minutes. Unexpectedly we observed the death of five fetuses by 65 minutes after nicardipine. We conclude that the administration of nicardipine in the hypertensive ewe results in significant alterations of fetal cardiorespiratory status and placental function that may lead to acidemia.\r"

Therefore nicardipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, should modulate angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. Regional blood flows were measured with radioactive microspheres in five chronically catheterized near-term ewes both before and 15 minutes after maternal infusion of angiotensin II at 5 micrograms/min. Nicardipine was then administered intravenously at 20 micrograms/kg/min over 2 minutes while the angiotensin II infusion was maintained. Blood flows were measured after 5 minutes. Maternal blood pressure levels were increased by angiotensin II from 83 +/- 4 mm Hg to 114 +/- 5 mm Hg, and were decreased to 70 +/- 4 mm Hg by nicardipine (p less than 0.05). Nicardipine also reversed angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction in the renal and endomyometrial vascular beds (p less than 0.05). Unexpectedly, however, nicardipine worsened placental vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin II, as placental blood flow fell from 242 +/- 32 ml.min-1.kg-1 fetal weight to 128 +/- 7 ml.min-1.kg-1 fetal weight (p less than 0.05), and placental resistance increased from 0.48 +/- 0.04 mm Hg.ml-1.min.kg-1 fetal weight to 0.55 +/- 0.05 mm Hg.ml-1.min.kg-1 fetal weight (p less than 0.05). Nicardipine reverses angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction systemically and in the kidney and uterus of the pregnant ewe, but does not reverse placental vasoconstriction and may significantly alter fetal cardiorespiratory status.\r"

We used a naturally occurring model of growth retardation in rabbits to test the hypothesis that reduced risk might be related to precocious maturation of the alveolar beta-adrenergic response system in runted neonates. We confirmed that the weights of the fetuses were significantly different, depending on uterine position, as predicted by this model. However, we found no evidence of either increased beta-adrenergic receptor concentration or cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation in the smaller fetuses. These results indicate that reduced fetal size in this model of growth retardation does not result in accelerated maturation of alveolar beta-adrenergic responses in neonates.\r"

Acute fetal hypoxemia was induced by 60 to 90 seconds of total occlusion of the maternal common internal iliac artery in six sheep. Mean fetal PO2 levels decreased from 26.0 to 18.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after occlusion of uterine blood flow. Fetal heart rate decreased from 188 to 121 beats per minute at the end of occlusion (p less than 0.05). Placental vascular resistance did not change during the heart rate deceleration. The pulsatility index increased from 0.86 during the control period to 1.27 at the end of occlusion (p less than 0.05). After fetal parasympathetic blockade with atropine, fetal heart rate and placental vascular resistance did not change during occlusion. The pulsatility index did not change during occlusion after parasympathetic blockade. It is concluded that the changes in the umbilical artery pulsatility index during late decelerations in the fetal heart rate pattern appear to be primarily associated with changes in fetal heart rate and bear no relationship with placental vascular resistance.\r"

Guanine nucleotides resulted in a significant increase in basal enzymatic activity. The extent of enzymatic stimulation in estradiol-treated animals was significantly higher than that observed in either controls, animals receiving progesterone, or a combination of estradiol and progesterone. Sodium fluoride stimulation occurred in all treatment groups to a similar degree. However, guanine nucleotides resulted in a significant decrease in percent stimulation of maximal sodium fluoride-stimulated enzymatic activity. Finally, beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated enzymatic activity, as assayed by isoproterenol stimulation, was higher in those animals that received estradiol implants than in controls or the other two hormonally treated groups. Intrauterine administration of these sex steroid hormones, directly or indirectly, modulates myometrial adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Neonatal resuscitation in community hospitals is problematic because of the lack of on-site personnel with adequate training and experience. Even when efforts are made to transport high-risk mothers to tertiary care centers, the most complex resuscitations must occasionally be performed in all obstetric services. This dilemma can result in increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, and is reflected in the obstetric malpractice crisis. We present an approach to the problem in which a tertiary center actively intervenes to assist regional community hospitals to develop and implement resuscitation team capabilities. Key aspects of the system are training and implementation of hospital shift \"Code Pink\" teams composed of nonphysician professionals, a regional neonatal resuscitation protocol used by all participants, \"mock code\" resuscitation drills to maintain skills, and extensive quality assurance both at the local hospital and regional levels.\r"

Guidelines for universal infection precautions are aimed at minimizing the risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission by the creation of adequate physical barriers between the patient and the health care provider. Some of these guidelines are mutually exclusive to currently popular childbirth techniques in the very practical sense. However, the more important impact of universal infection precautions is likely to be psychological. Anxiety and the necessity for physical isolation are probably the worst basis for an empathic human relationship with the patient. It is the current challenge of obstetrics to maintain a sensitive and client-centered approach while judiciously dealing with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic.\r"

Mitogen-induced leukocyte proliferation was higher in the presence of peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis compared with other samples. Five out of 23 samples from endometriosis patients contained elevated levels of interleukin-1 and three out of 23 contained elevated levels of interleukin-2. Six out of eight peritoneal fluid samples from unexplained infertility patients also had elevated levels of interleukin-2; samples from fertile women did not contain elevated levels of either cytokine. Our data indicate that peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis and unexplained infertility support the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes. Leukocyte products may locally affect the progression of disease and fertility.\r"

  ".U": "90023687\r", 
  ".W": "The circulating concentration of endometrial protein PP14 varied during the menstrual cycle in patients with endometriosis. The highest levels were found on days 1 to 4 of the cycle (176 +/- 123 micrograms/L; mean +/- SD), and the lowest on days 5 to 20 (44.1 +/- 29.7 micrograms/L). Rising levels were observed on days 21 to 30 (58.3 +/- 62.6 micrograms/L). On days 5 to 20 (i.e., during period of the lowest levels) patients with advanced endometriosis had higher PP14 levels (63.9 +/- 39.0 micrograms/L) than those with mild endometriosis (29.3 +/- 18.2 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01). Patients with mild endometriosis had slightly higher serum PP14 levels than apparently healthy control subjects (p less than 0.05), but overlapping of values between the two groups is remarkable. Conservative surgical elimination of endometriosis significantly decreased the serum PP14 levels. Treatment with danazol (600 mg/day), or with medroxyprogesterone acetate (100 mg/day) after laparoscopy also resulted in significant decreases in the serum PP14 concentration. After 6 months of treatment, conservative surgery in combination with danazol or with medroxyprogesterone acetate, yielded more pronounced declines in serum PP14 level than conservative surgery plus placebo. No significant difference was observed between the effects of danazol and medroxyprogesterone acetate. We conclude that endometriosis tissue contributes to the circulating PP14 level, and the decline in PP14 level during danazol and medroxyprogesterone acetate treatments reflects regression of intrauterine and ectopic endometrial tissues.\r"

In this study plasma concentrations of beta-carotene and retinol were measured in coded samples by sensitive high-pressure liquid chromatography in a cross-sectional study of 149 normal healthy women attending a family planning clinic. At the time of recruitment in the morning, a general health questionnaire was administered for patient age, methods of contraception, smoking habits, and food intake at breakfast. Of the 149 enrolled volunteers, 88 were oral contraceptive users and 61 were not users. Among users, 21 smoked cigarettes, and there were 18 smokers among nonusers. Oral contraceptive users had significantly lower plasma concentrations of beta-carotene (p less than 0.001) and higher retinol levels (p less than 0.0001). Plasma beta-carotene or retinol levels did not differ among users of intrauterine contraceptive devices or barrier methods of contraception. No association was noted between the plasma levels of these two micronutrients and age greater than or less than 30 years. Cigarette smoking alone was associated with significantly reduced plasma beta-carotene levels in nonusers (p less than 0.001). Combined cigarette smoking and oral contraceptive usage were associated with low plasma beta-carotene levels; the results appear to be additive. These findings suggest a possible synergistic effect on plasma beta-carotene levels from the use of both cigarette smoking and oral contraception.\r"

Sperm-bound immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A both occurred at a significantly higher frequency (p less than 0.05) in partners of women with serum antisperm antibodies. Increased incidence of both immunoglobulin G (p less than 0.01) and immunoglobulin M (p less than 0.005) circulating antisperm antibodies in females were observed when the male partners had antibody-bound sperm. Antibody-coated sperm may activate lymphocytes in the female partners after coitus, thus leading to the production of antisperm antibodies. This may be an additional mechanism that leads to female isoimmunity to sperm and infertility.\r"

Fetal heart rate alterations were observed in high proportion. Cesarean section for cephalopelvic disproportion was indicated in 60% of operations, and 13% of the fetuses weighed greater than 4000 gm. Depression occurred in 15% of infants at 1 minute and in 4% at 5 minutes. Prolonged hospital stay was seen in 9%, and postmaturity syndrome in 19%. There were four perinatal deaths (two corrected). Active induction does not appear to increase the cesarean section rate. The durations of predelivery observation may be longer because the cervices are frequently unripe. There is a high incidence of fetal heart rate alterations. Induction appears justified as an active intervention to prevent some sudden unexplained deaths.\r"

When the serum progesterone level was low, the oviductal electrophysiologic characteristics were those associated with poor ovum transfer: low probability of prouterine propagation of the activity at the fimbrial end of the tube: high-frequency but low number of electrical bursts, reflecting possible weak propulsive force; and a high occurrence rate of sine-wave-like activity and inactive areas where ovum retention can occur.

This observation suggests that the origin of the disease is different in the two populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined couples in whom the woman developed a gestational trophoblastic tumor in a white population (Pittsburgh) and a Chinese population (Taiwan) for sharing of human leukocyte A, B, DR, and DQ antigens, which we consider markers for sharing of major histocompatibility complex-linked recessive genes affecting both embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. No human leukocyte antigen sharing occurred between partners in Pittsburgh, but there was significant human leukocyte antigen sharing in Taiwan. The latter couples shared human leukocyte antigen B (p less than 0.04) and human leukocyte antigen DQ (p less than 0.007) and shared three or more human leukocyte A, B, DR, and DQ antigens (p less than 0.02) significantly more frequently than did normal couples. However, there was no increased sharing of any specific human leukocyte antigen allele. These findings support the hypothesis that gestational trophoblastic tumors occur on a sporadic basis in whites and on a genetic basis in Chinese.\r"

Recent reports suggest that micronization of progesterone enhances absorption and increases serum and tissue levels of progesterone. This study checks serum progesterone levels before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after oral administration of 200 mg of progesterone in seven subjects. Progesterone was plain milled, micronized, plain milled in oil, micronized in oil, or micronized in enteric-coated capsules. All patients exhibited a significant increase in serum progesterone levels after oral progesterone administration. Mean peak progesterone levels (30.3 +/- 7.0 ng/ml) (p less than 0.005) were achieved with micronized progesterone in oil at 2.0 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) hours after administration. Four types of oral progesterone had equivalent mean peak elevations and mean times to peak: plain milled, 9.6 +/- 2.5 ng/ml at 4.0 +/- 0.5 hours; micronized 13.2 +/- 2.4 ng/ml at 3.2 +/- 0.4 hours; plain milled in oil, 11.3 +/- 3.0 ng/ml at 4.0 +/- 0.5 hours; and micronized in enteric-coated capsules, 11.2 +/- 3.0 ng/ml at 4.1 +/- 0.7 hours. Contrary to traditional teaching, these data show that significant serum progesterone levels can be achieved by oral administration. Absorption can be significantly improved by the physical characteristics of the progesterone and the vehicle used with oral administration.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose metabolism was evaluated in pregnant women with clinically and biochemically demonstrated intrahepatic cholestasis. Laboratory investigations included measurements of serum glucose concentrations on fasting and 2 hours after breakfast, the glucose tolerance test (100 gm oral glucose load), and 24-hour glycemia profile. All patients were admitted to the II Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Medical School in Warsaw, Poland. None of the patients exhibited manifest diabetes mellitus or had any clinical history suggestive of previous diabetes. The serum samples collected 2 hours after breakfast demonstrated higher glucose concentrations in women with intrahepatic cholestasis when compared with healthy control subjects. The glucose tolerance tests demonstrated consistently higher concentrations of glucose in blood serum samples after loading in the study group. The 24-hour glycemia profile showed greater glucose concentrations in serum samples collected 2 hours after breakfast and after supper. These results suggest that in the course of cholestasis in pregnancy, visible changes occur in the carbohydrate metabolism of the pregnant woman.\r"

The relationship between the individual surfactant components was studied after covariance adjustment for the length of gestation. In severe early-onset preeclampsia, the 35 kd surfactant protein/saturated phosphatidylcholine ratio was significantly higher than in the other pregnancies. In diabetic pregnancies (classes B to D without preeclampsia), the phosphatidylglycerol/saturated phosphatidylcholine ratio was lower than in the other pregnancies. Isolated surfactant complex showed similar abnormalities. In severe early-onset preeclampsia and insulin-dependent diabetes without vascular disease, the phosphatidylglycerol/saturated phosphatidylcholine ratio correlated negatively with fetal growth. In four samples of amniotic fluids from cases of severe early-onset preeclampsia, the 35 kd protein falsely predicted lung maturity. All had abnormally high 35 kd protein/saturated phosphatidylcholine ratios (greater than 2 SD of controls). According to the present results, the 35 kd protein may give a false mature test result in severe preeclampsia.\r"

Relaxin was measured by specific human relaxin radioimmunoassay. Relaxin from milk and sera behaved similarly in the relaxin radioimmunoassay and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of relaxin in sera and milk collected 3 days after delivery did not differ significantly within the term or preterm groups. Neither were there differences in relaxin levels in sera and milk between the term and preterm groups. At 6 weeks postpartum, relaxin was not measured in any sera but was measured in milk from six of eight patients in the term group and five of six patients in the preterm group. Relaxin concentrations in milk were higher in the preterm group. The presence of relaxin in milk at 6 weeks postpartum suggests a nonluteal site of synthesis.\r"

These laboring subjects were placed in the left lateral decubitus position with epidural labor anesthesia. Ejection fraction was not affected by firm contractions, although a small increase in left ventricular end-diastolic measurements was noted. There was a tendency for maternal heart rate to decrease (-5%); however, this trend was not statistically significant. A 16% increase in left ventricular stroke volume (75 +/- 15 to 89 +/- 17 ml) (p less than 0.001) was associated with an overall 11% augmentation of maternal cardiac output (6.31 +/- 1.79 to 7.12 +/- 1.93 L/min) (p less than 0.001). These findings support the hypothesis that uterine contractions increase maternal stroke volume through autotransfusion of uteroplacental blood and cardiac preload augmentation during normal labor.\r"

Auditory brainstem response testing and renal function studies were performed on the 10 babies in the experimental group and 10 babies in each of two control groups to determine the safety of vancomycin use during pregnancy. Auditory brainstem responses were not normal at birth in six infants from the three different groups studied (N = 30) but were normal at 3 months in five. The sixth infant had conductive hearing loss unrelated to vancomycin use that spontaneously disappeared at 12 months of age. Renal function was normal in all infants. Vancomycin was detected in cord blood in two patients and in breast milk in one. Adequate serum levels were achieved with routine doses in eight mothers tested; no adverse reactions occurred. It appears that vancomycin use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy does not produce sensorineural hearing loss or nephrotoxicity in the infant.\r"

A large data base was collected on all patients. Patients with gestational diabetes mellitus were older, shorter, heavier, and had more children than did the control group. The higher cesarean section rate in the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus was explained by their increased rate of repeat cesarean section compared with control patients. This was associated with increased infectious complications. Other maternal complication rates were similar in the two groups. Acceptable glucose control did not normalize birth weight percentiles in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. Maternal weight at delivery was the only significant predictor of birth weight percentile in the group with gestational diabetes mellitus. Plasma glucose levels were a poor predictor of birth weight percentile. Factors associated with maternal obesity in well-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus may be more significant than glucose control in the development of large-for-gestational-age infants.\r"

We describe three women in which C. sordellii caused puerperal infection and a distinctive and lethal toxic shock-like syndrome. Patients were less than 1 week post partum and each had a single, limited focus of infection including infection associated with a retained vaginal sponge, a cesarean section operative site, and endometritis. Each patient had a distinctive course characterized by sudden onset of clinical shock marked by severe and unrelenting hypotension associated with marked, generalized tissue edema and \"third spacing\" with increased hematocrit, presence of marked leukemoid reaction with total neutrophil counts of 84,000/mm3, 66,000/mm3, and 93,600/mm3, absence of rash or fever, limited or no myonecrosis, and a rapid and uniformly lethal course. Hypoalbuminemia was also noted. Similar findings were noted in prior isolated reports of C. sordellii-mediated postpartum or surgical infection. Treatment of animals with C. sordellii or closely related C. difficile toxins produces similar findings. We suggest that localized infection with toxin-producing strains of C. sordellii can produce a rapidly lethal toxic shock-like syndrome. Further study and earlier recognition of this syndrome may be life-saving in other patients.\r"

There was mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and the decrease in pH was significantly correlated with both hypercapnia and hyperlacticemia. In the umbilical artery (n = 53) there was a significant linear correlation between the degree of hypoxemia and the degrees of hypercapnia or acidosis. In the umbilical vein (n = 143), the correlations between the degree of hypoxemia and the degrees of hypercapnia, hyperlacticemia, or acidosis were exponential.\r"

These rudimentary ciliary processes were observed only in the anterior half of the pars plicata. At their posterior end, the ciliary nonpigmented epithelium had been ruptured and a break by zonular traction was apparent. In the other region of the pars plicata, ciliary processes were normal and no break was detected. The break in the pars plicata was treated by diathermy application and segmental scleral buckling, without subretinal fluid drainage, and with the resulting reattachment of the retina. Hypoplasia of ciliary processes is basically responsible for the development of a break in the pars plicata.\r"

Angioid streaks were found in 20 patients from both the beta thalassemia major and beta thalassemia intermedia groups (nine and 11 patients, respectively). A positive correlation was found between age and angioid streaks (P = .0017), as was a difference in the prevalence of angioid streaks between the two forms of the disease (P = .079). Additionally, a significant correlation was noted between chelating therapy and the prevalence of angioid streaks (P = .039). However, using multivariate analysis to correct for the effects of age, the correlation of angioid streaks with the form of disease disappeared, whereas the level of significance between chelation therapy and angioid streaks was reduced (P = .05). The high frequency of angioid streaks observed in patients with beta thalassemia and the severe complications observed in one patient render a thorough ophthalmoscopic examination and follow-up of such patients necessary for both early diagnosis and possible therapeutic intervention.\r"

In seven patients, the tissue was isolated for transmission electron microscopic study. Millipore filter specimens of the vitreous aspirates from all of the patients were studied by light microscopy. Vitreous condensates were present in all 29 specimens, fibrocellular membrane fragments were present in three, and fragments of internal limiting membrane were present in four. A collagen matrix was present in each of the seven specimens studied by electron microscopy, and in every specimen, the collagen's diameter was consistent with indigenous vitreous collagen. These findings confirm the presence of an acellular tissue layer on the posterior retina in eyes with an impending macular hole and indicate that it is usually indigenous vitreous collagen.\r"

Other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin B. Ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (MIC90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. The MIC90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and St. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against P. aeruginosa. Because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.\r"

In contrast, these deposits were absent from the normal pars plana and from the retinal detachment without proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Moreover, pigment and nonpigment epithelial cells were found to express HLA-DR and HLA-DQ determinants in six of the eight patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Our results are similar to those obtained in a previous study on proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which suggests the involvement of autoimmune phenomena in proliferative diseases and eventual interactions between the immune system and peptide growth factors. However, whether or not this immune reaction functions in the initiation or extension of intraocular proliferative syndromes remains to be determined.\r"

Variability of rim and disk areas was not significantly different between these two groups (P greater than .05), nor was it significantly different between images acquired during the same session and those acquired during different sessions (P greater than .05). Variability was significantly different between subject groups based on the distinctness of the disk edge and the slope of the cup wall (P less than .01). The average minimum change in the measurements on the same eye that would exceed variability of the technique at the 95% confidence level was 0.20 mm2 and 0.47 mm2 for rim area for the least variable and most variable subject groups based on optic nerve head characteristics, and 0.09 mm2 and 0.32 mm2 for disk area for the corresponding subject groups. Operator input contributed significantly to overall variability. Reliability of rim and disk areas in this study was comparable to that reported for other computerized image analyzers.\r"

The mean difference between readings obtained with the lens in place and readings obtained after lens removal was 0.85 mm Hg and was statistically significant (P less than .01). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals suggest that the true difference between mean Tono-Pen readings obtained with and without the lens in place ranges from -0.3 to +1.5 mm Hg. Our results suggest that the Tono-Pen is probably an effective way to estimate intraocular pressure through bandage contact lenses, with a probable true mean difference of less than 1.5 mm Hg and a standard deviation of about 2 mm Hg.\r"

The presence of heavy skin pigmentation in association with conjunctival melanoma appeared to be an ominous sign, even when the eyelid did not show histologic features of malignancy. Twelve of the 17 patients (70%) died of metastases after histologic verification of the conjunctival melanoma.\r"

Each patient had one or more conjunctival biopsy specimens that documented melanoma, and in each patient the melanomas evolved in primary acquired melanosis of the conjunctiva. Histologic examination of the epithelium adjacent to the tumor in the nasal cavity failed to show either atypia or diffuse melanosis. We believe that these melanomas in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are most likely to evolve as regional metastases, although it is possible that they arise de novo or as related foci in accordance with the multicentric characteristics of conjunctival melanoma. If a patient with a conjunctival melanoma has symptoms referable to the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, ophthalmologists should refer the patient to an otolaryngologist.\r"

All three agents protected against the cigarette smoke effect. Heat inactivated catalase or superoxide dismutase was not protective. These observations indicate that active oxygen species, probably derived from the cigarette smoke, play a role in smoke-mediated fiber transport into tracheobronchial epithelia.\r"

The relative numerical density of these cells remained elevated when compared with saline-treated controls throughout the 12 weeks of the experiment. Cells expressing the CD4 and CD8 antigens were both increased in number, with the former accounting for approximately two-thirds of the T lymphocytes. An increased number of B lymphocytes was also apparent from 6 weeks after treatment with silica. The T lymphocyte response preceded the development of significant pulmonary fibrosis by several weeks. No lymphocyte response was observed in the lungs of mice injected with nonfibrogenic titanium dioxide. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that lymphokines secreted by T lymphocytes play a role in the pathogenesis of silicotic inflammatory lesions and their progression to fibrosis.\r"

There are only a few published immunophenotypic and/or genotypic studies of DML, and they include a small number of cases. It is unclear whether these neoplasms are monoclonal, oligoclonal, or perhaps of dual lineage. Using monoclonal antibodies (UCHL1, MB2, MT1, LN1, LN2, and L26) that are effective in paraffin-embedded, B5-fixed tissue, 13 cases of DML were studied. This method allowed for improved correlation between cell morphology and immunophenotype compared with frozen section immunohistology. In addition, Southern blotting/DNA hybridization was used to identify directly the lineage of the neoplastic cell population. In each case a population of large B lymphocytes was demonstrated by immunohistology. In six of the cases, a single class of immunoglobulin light chains was detected by frozen section immunohistology, cytospin immunocytology, or both supporting the hypothesis that the B lymphocytes are monoclonal. In almost all the cases (12 of 13), the small cell population consisted predominantly of T lymphocytes. Immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were detected in seven cases, but no T cell receptor gene rearrangements were detected. It was concluded that DML are monoclonal lymphomas of B cell lineage with a non-neoplastic T cell component.\r"

Confluent cell monolayers were radiolabeled with [35S]sulfate or [35S]cysteine. Proteoglycans were isolated from the medium and cell layers by ion exchange chromatography and their nature determined by enzyme digestion (chondroitinase ABC) or degradative treatment (nitrous acid). It was found that more than 80% of the proteoglycans in both the cell layer and medium were heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) based on their susceptibility to nitrous acid degradation. More than half of the HSPG in the cell layer could be precipitated with an antiserum that specifically recognizes BM HSPG; only 10% of those released into the medium were precipitated with this antiserum. When immunoprecipitates of [35S] sulfate-labeled proteoglycans were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the mature proteoglycans ran as a broad band at the top of the gel. When immunoprecipitates of [35S]cysteine-labeled proteoglycans were similarly analyzed, a 250 kd precursor core protein band was seen in addition to the mature proteoglycan. When BM HSPG were localized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (immunoperoxidase), they were found intracellularly in biosynthetic compartments (ER and Golgi cisternae) and extracellularly in deposits of basement membrane-like matrix located beneath and between the cells. These results indicate that l) BM HSPG are the predominant type of proteoglycans made by glomerular epithelial cells in culture; 2) these HSPG are assembled into a loosely organized matrix that is deposited beneath and between the cells; and 3) this cell type produces a higher proportion of BM HSPG than other cultured epithelial cells studied previously.\r"

The results showed that ceruloplasmin interferes with this process and reduces the number of phorbol myristate acetate-activated leukocytes that adhere to endothelium. Preincubation of either the activated PMNs or the endothelium with ceruloplasmin did not produce the same results, suggesting that the continuous presence of ceruloplasmin is required. During attachment PMNs become activated and release a variety of substances, including toxic oxygen species such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In the in vitro system used in this study no injury occurred to the endothelial cells, as measured by 51Cr release, when activated PMNs were added with ceruloplasmin. The data show that ceruloplasmin reduced, in a dose dependent manner, the levels of superoxide produced by the activated PMNs, further supporting ceruloplasmin's previously reported role as a scavenger of superoxide. Ceruloplasmin also reduced the levels of superoxide when activated PMNs were in contact with endothelial cells. Although ceruloplasmin interfered with the copper-dependent scavenger enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), in a cell-free system, ceruloplasmin had no effect on SOD in intact endothelial cells. These results suggest that ceruloplasmin may act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing the number of PMNs attaching to endothelium and by acting as an extracellular scavenger of superoxide.\r"

Lead nitrate administration (10 mumol/100 g body weight) resulted in a ninefold increase in the incorporation of labeled thymidine into renal DNA and in an enhancement in the mitotic index; these changes were accompanied by an increase in the organ weight and DNA content that reached a maximum at 2 days. Regression of the renal hyperplasia was observed as early as 3 days after treatment and was completed within 2 weeks. Although lytic necrosis was not responsible for cell loss, the elimination of the excess renal cells took the form of apoptosis. This distinctive mode of cell death, which has been implicated in the involution of hyperplasia in other tissues and organs, was characterized by the occurrence of intracellular and extracellular membrane-bounded eosinophilic globules that often contained nuclear fragments. It affected mainly cells of the proximal tubules, and it was not detected once the kidney had regressed to its original mass. These results support the hypothesis that apoptosis is involved in the regulation of organ size.\r"

IL-3 did not induce an initial neutropenia such as accompanies endotoxin-, G-CSF-, and TNF-induced neutrophilia, or lymphopenia such as accompanies endotoxin-, IL-1-, and TNF-induced neutrophilia. The IL-3-induced peripheral neutrophilia was accompanied by a decrease in mature marrow neutrophils, indicating that the mechanism of neutrophilia was through marrow release rather than by demargination, which occurs after the administration of epinephrine or IL-6. The release of mature marrow neutrophils further suggests that IL-3 either has intrinsic neutrophil releasing activity or indirectly causes neutrophil release through the gene expression of a second cytokine. IL-3 induced a striking left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia in the bone marrow at 8 hours that morphologically was very similar to that observed after administration of endotoxin, a finding consistent with the hypothesis of previous investigators that endotoxin may in part act indirectly on hematopoietic cells by eliciting local marrow production of IL-3. Finally, IL-3 induced an increase in marrow pronormoblasts at 8 hours, consistent with the in vitro proliferative effect of IL-3 on erythroid stem cells. The combination of IL-3 and IL-6 induced a synergistic peripheral neutrophilia and monocytosis and a striking synergistic increase in marrow mast cells. The combination of IL-3 and IL-6 also induced an erythroid and left-shifted myeloid hyperplasia such as would be expected given the individual effects of these hematopoietic growth factors.\r"

The objective of this study was to identify the phenotypes of the cells within the tumors and to attempt to determine the origin of the neoplastic cell population(s). At the ultrastructural level, the neoplastic cells resembled normal thymic epithelium with tonofilaments and desmosomes. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated the presence of cytokeratin, Iak, -beta 2-microglobulin, -asialo-GM1, the thymic cortical epithelial marker ER-TR4, and the medullary epithelial marker ER-TR5. Islands of normal cortical thymocytes supported by residual normal cortical epithelium and acid phosphatase-positive cortical macrophages were interspersed in the tumors. Residual islands of normal medullary architecture with nonspecific esterase-positive IDCs were rarely identified in tumors. Most lymphocytes in the tumors were normal immature cortical thymocytes with the phenotype Tdt+, PNA+, Thy 1.2bright, Ly-1dull, H-2Kkdull, ThB+, J11d+, and Lyt-2+L3T4+. Lymphocytes in the tumors were steroid-sensitive like normal thymocytes. The proportions of Lyt-2+L3T4- and Lyt-2-L3T4+ cells were generally larger in the tumors than in normal thymus and reflected the higher frequency of lymphocytes in the tumors capable of proliferating in vitro in response to Con A plus IL-2. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that the neoplasia originates from thymic epithelium that is interspersed with normal, developing thymic lymphocytes.\r"

Both PA/standard chow and normal/cholesterol-supplemented rodent groups manifested significantly greater peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis and glomerular macrophage number when compared with normal/standard chow animals. However, the combination of the nephrotic state with superimposed alimentary hypercholesterolemia (PA/cholesterol-supplemented group) produced the greatest rise in these parameters, a rise that was significantly greater than was produced in the three other groups. Regarding basal eicosanoid production by macrophages, there was a numerical trend toward increased production of thromboxane B2 in the PA/standard chow animals and normal/cholesterol-supplemented rats when compared with normal/standard chow. Again, the combination of nephrosis and alimentary hypercholesterolemia in the PA/cholesterol-supplemented group was associated with a significantly greater amount of thromboxane B2 generated when compared with the other three groups. Regarding PGE2 production, there were no significant differences among the groups, despite marked differences in fasting serum lipid levels. This data suggest that there is a synergistic effect between alimentary hypercholesterolemia and the secondary hyperlipidemia of nephrosis in producing these macrophage functional alterations. Because fasting triglyceride values between the two nephrotic groups were indifferent, one can further speculate that it is the elevation of the serum cholesterol value that predominantly evokes these changes in macrophage function.\r"

To investigate the hypothesis that severe sustained proteinuria plays a role in the pathogenesis of TIN, the renal interstitium in a model of protein-overload proteinuria was studied. After uninephrectomy, rats received daily injections of 1.0 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or saline (controls) until killing at 1, 2, 4, or 7 weeks. Sections of frozen renal cortex were stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with subsets of rat lymphohemopoietic cells, and positive tubulointerstitial cells (TIC) were quantitated by epifluorescence microscopy. BSA rats developed proteinuria, with mean rat urinary albumin excretion rates at 1, 2, 3, and 6 weeks of 35.6 +/- 21.8, 97.2 +/- 46.1, 63.6 +/- 40.8, and 58.6 +/- 24.4 mg/24 hours, respectively (controls, 0.17 +/- 0.16 mg/24 hours). BSA was detectable in the plasma of experimental animals at all periods, with mean values of 26.8 +/- 3.8, 27.8 +/- 2.7, 20.3 +/- 6.2, and 7.0 +/- 1.1 mg/ml (controls, 0.03 +/- 0.04 mg/ml) at 1, 2, 4, and 7 weeks, respectively, whereas plasma anti-BSA antibodies were never detected. A significant mononuclear cell infiltrate was present in the interstitium of experimental animals at all periods. At 1 week, an influx of macrophages was evident that was identified by surface markers OX42 (75+/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.01) and Ia (58+/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.01). Macrophages dominated the infiltrate at all periods. By 2 weeks, a significant population of lymphocytes was also present that was identified by the surface marker OX19 (54+/1000 TIC) (P less than 0.01). This early lymphocytic infiltrate was a mixed lesion of T helper and T cytotoxic cells. However, at 4 and 7 weeks, most lymphocytes expressed the OX8 cytotoxic T cell marker. The proximal tubules of proteinuric rats expressed vimentin intermediate filaments, a marker of tubular epithelial cell regeneration after injury. In BSA rats, C3 and neoantigens of the membrane attack complex of complement without IgG were present along the luminal border of many tubular epithelial cells. The interstitial infiltrate was confirmed by light microscopy. By 4 weeks, focal areas of chronic interstitial disease were evident consisting of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. In a second study, one group of BSA-treated rats was depleted of circulating T lymphocytes by daily parenteral injections of monoclonal antibody OX19.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The production of tumor necrosis factors (TNF) from cells of two Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) lines, HDLM-1 and KM-H2 was examined. The culture supernatant from these two types of H-RS cells exerts a cytotoxic effect on L929 cells. Both tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin (TNF-beta) are responsible for this activity. This was confirmed by the presence in the cells of proteins and m-RNAs of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, as determined with immunoperoxidase staining and Northern blot hybridization. Approximately 20% of HDLM cells and 5% of KM-H2 cells were positively stained by a monoclonal anti-TNF-alpha antibody, and this staining was inhibited by preabsorption of the antibody with recombinant TNF-alpha. Staining with anti-TNF-beta, however, showed an intense reaction in more than 60% of HDLM-1 cells, but only in 5% to 10% of KM-H2 cells. The abundant expression of TNF-beta in HDLM-1 cells is consistent with approximately 10 times the TNF activity in HDLM-1-conditioned medium as compared with that of KM-H2. The rich secretion of TNF-beta in HDLM-1 cells was also validated by the inhibition of most of the TNF activity in HDLM-1-conditioned medium with anti-TNF-beta antibody, and by the presence of abundant TNF-beta mRNA in HDLM-1 cells. The reason for the abundant production of TNF-beta in HDLM-1 cells is not yet known, but may be attributable to a chromosomal abnormality in the 6p21 region. The expression of TNF-alpha, but not TNF-beta, by H-RS cells was demonstrated in lymph nodes from patients with Hodgkin's disease. The capacity of H-RS cells to secrete TNF as well as other cytokines, such as interleukin-1, colony-stimulating factors, and transforming growth factors, may contribute to the unique clinical and histopathologic alterations in patients with Hodgkin's disease.\r"

Thereafter, NF-M attains its mature state of phosphorylation more rapidly than does NF-H. However, little is known about NF subunit expression during cell division. A rapidly dividing medulloblastoma cell line (D283 MED), therefore, was examined using flow cytometry, immunochemistry, and a large panel of NF subunit-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Many of the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) distinguished NF-H and NF-M in different states of phosphorylation. By flow cytometry, more than 90% of the D283 cells expressed NF-H and NF-M in different states of phosphorylation, and an antiserum specific for the carboxy terminus of NF-L labeled more than 60% of these cells. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity produced by MAbs that detected phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated NF-H and/or NF-M epitopes, appropriately decreased or increased, respectively, by preincubating the D283 cells with alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, cell staining with antibodies specific for phosphate-independent NF protein epitopes did not change substantially as a result of enzymatic dephosphorylation. These results agreed closely with those obtained from studies of normal human spinal cord NF extracts. However, NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L were expressed throughout the cell cycle in dual parameter studies of D283 cells labeled with an antibody and propidium iodide. Nevertheless, reductions in the fluorescence intensity produced with most of these antibodies late in the cell cycle suggested that NF proteins may be subject to modifications in their structure or accessibility to antibody probes during different phases of the cell cycle. These data led to the conclusion that NF subunits are expressed throughout the cell cycle in cultured human medulloblastoma cells, but that subtle changes in the immunoreactivity of these proteins occur during cell division.\r"

The possible relationship between cell size and cell cycle activity in malignant lymphomas was investigated using multiparameter flow cytometry and digital image analysis. Flow cytometric analysis of ten cases of B cell lymphoma revealed that, regardless of the diagnosis or the proportion of large cells present, large neoplastic cells showed a much greater proportion of S + G2/M phase activity (mean, 35.2%; range, 14.6% to 70.5%) than did small cells (mean, 4.4%; range, 0.5% to 18.4%). Further studies aimed at distinguishing the features of cycling and noncycling cells were performed using quantitative image analysis of nuclear staining by Ki-67 antibody. In both benign and malignant lymphoid infiltrates, resting (Ki-67-negative) nuclei were uniformly smaller than Ki-67-positive nuclei and exhibited a restricted size distribution, whereas the Ki-67-positive nuclei had a broad size distribution and included the vast majority of large forms. Thus, the actively cycling component of the tumor consisted of cells with large nuclei. These studies support the hypothesis that cellular and nuclear size heterogeneity in malignant lymphomas is related to cell cycle phase. The combined influences of cell differentiation and proliferation on cellular morphology can explain many of the histologic features observed in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\r"

Amebas did not attach to the luminal surface of the mucosa except at interglandular regions, where parasites penetrated apparently through pseudopodial movement. Once in the lamina propria, trophozoites multiplied and destroyed mucosal components. Damage extended laterally through the mucosa, but progression to deeper layers of the intestinal wall was prevented by the muscularis mucosae, which acted as a partial barrier. This was eventually breached at focal points where amebas invaded the submucosa. Electron microscopy clearly showed the lysis of abundant polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes (PMNs) by the amebas at the periphery of intestinal ulcerations as well as the lack of bacteria at these sites. This study demonstrates that recruitment and destruction of inflammatory cells following intestinal amebic invasion may take place in the absence of bacterial multiplication. The observations provide histological support to the hypothesis that lysis of PMNs by trophozoites participates in the genesis of amebic intestinal lesions.\r"

New aspects of suprapylarian Leishmania behavior were elucidated. In the sand fly midgut, amastigotes transformed into promastigotes (division promastigote I) during a first division sequence within the bloodmeal. Secondary division of these promastigotes resulted in a second form (division promastigote II), and these subsequently elongated into nectomonad promastigotes. Nectomonads existed in long and short populations which divided in the bloodmeal and throughout the midgut lumen after escape from the peritrophic membrane. Nectomonads adhered to the midgut cells in a highly organized manner, with their flagella embedded deep into microvilli and cytoplasm. Migration of parasites from the posterior midgut into the cardia/stomodeal valve region at 36 hr was associated with breakdown of the peritrophic membrane anteriorly. Posterior breakdown at 48 hr resulted in a peritrophic tube open at both ends containing some parasites within the digesting bloodmeal for up to 6 days postinfection. At the stomodeal valve, a myriad of slender and rounded promastigotes attached to the intima by flagellar hemidesmosomes; these may represent a transformation sequence from slender nectomonads to pear-shaped haptomonads. Pear-shaped forms appear to be precursors of paramastigotes, which also attached to the valve intima. Both rounded haptomonads and paramastigotes were found in the esophagus, dividing in a complex sequence initiated by posterior cleavage of the cytoplasm producing unique heart-shaped forms. Dividing paramastigotes also colonized the pharynx up to the cibarial valve. The ultrastructure of paramastigotes suggested that they may be infective forms, capable of some motility in the foregut. Free-swimming \"infective\" promastigotes were observed throughout the midgut and foregut, were attached in the pharynx (armature region), and were associated with the labrum-epipharynx of the proboscis in 3.6% of flies (16 days). The fine structure of hemidesmosomes in the foregut showed regional specializations, including the presence of plasmalemmar bridges in the gap space.\r"

The test is conducted in a serum-free, chemically defined medium containing 120 micrograms protein/ml, minimizing the possible interference of drug: serum protein interaction. Prior adaptation is not necessary to cultivate \"difficult-to-grow\" species. Leishmania sensitivity to pentavalent antimonials is detectable at micrograms levels below concentrations achievable in patients' sera.\r"

Mosquitoes (63,644) collected during this 3 year period yielded 21 virus strains. Ockelbo virus isolations were from Culiseta morsitans (5 strains), Culex pipiens and/or Cx. torrentium (6 strains), and Aedes cinereus (3 strains). Inkoo (6 strains) and Batai (1 strain) viruses were recovered from Ae. communis. Blood samples collected March-May from migrating birds on the southeast and est coast of Sweden and in July and August from resident birds in east-central Sweden were tested for neutralizing antibody to Ockelbo virus. Antibody was not detected in 328 birds sampled during spring migrations. Two of 58 (3.4%) birds bled in July and 8 of 78 birds (10%) bled in August had antibody to Ockelbo virus. Ockelbo virus circulates in a mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle, with Cs. morsitans and Cx. pipiens and/or Cx. torrentium as enzootic vectors. Antibody was detected in passerine birds. Other classes of birds or other vertebrates were not sampled. Aedes cinereus may serve primarily to transmit virus to people. The role of other mosquito species as vectors for people is unknown.\r"

These patients had no serological evidence of HIV infection and could not be classified as AIDS patients according to CDC criteria. The clinical signs as well as laboratory and pathological studies of these patients suggested an active infectious process, although no etiological agent was found despite extensive infectious disease work-ups during their hospitalization. Post-mortem examinations showed histopathological lesions of fulminant necrosis involving the lymph nodes, spleen, lungs, liver, adrenal glands, heart, and/or brain. No viral inclusion cells, bacteria, fungi, or parasites could be identified in these tissues using special tissue stains. We report that immunohistochemistry using rabbit antiserum raised against VLIA, the virus-like infectious agent previously identified in patients with AIDS and shown to cause fatal systemic infection in primates, revealed VLIA antigens in these necrotizing lesions. In situ hybridization using an 35S labeled VLIA-specific DNA probe also detected VLIA genetic material in the areas of necrosis. Furthermore, virus-like particles closely resembling VLIA were identified ultrastructurally in these histopathological lesions. VLIA was associated with the systemic necrotizing lesions in these previously healthy non-AIDS patients with an acute fatal disease.\r"

At lower microfilaria densities, the sensitivity declined markedly. Furthermore, it was found that smaller and lighter snips were more likely to be classified as being falsely negative. The load of infection at the community level may be reduced after intervention strategies, such as vector control or community-based chemotherapy. Interpretation of the impact of these programs on the prevalence of infection should take into account the lower sensitivity of the skin snips at lower levels of infection.\r"

The assay utilizes high titer rabbit immunoglobulins to parasite excretory/secretory antigens (FhES) as capture antibody, and also as detection antibody when linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or to biotin for reaction with avidin-peroxidase. The assays were compared with a conventional (antibody detection) ELISA to determine diagnostic utility. Using mean rates of detection of fascioliasis, the HRP-based antigen capture assay diagnosed the infection at 1 week postinfection and showed that circulating antigen levels are maximal 3 weeks after infection. The earliest mean diagnosis for the antibody detection and the biotin-based antigen capture ELISAs were 2 and 3 weeks postinfection, respectively. The addition of known quantities of FhES antigens to normal mouse serum gave estimates of lower limits of detectability for the HRP- and biotin-based assays of 25 ng and 0.25 ng, respectively. Routine use of the biotin-avidin system in the antigen capture test resulted in high background activity making this method insensitive.\r"

Of 72 unfed nymphal Ixodes dentatus swept from vegetation, 32% were infected by this spirochete, as determined by darkfield microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody H5332. Infected ticks were reared from larvae feeding on each of 11 rabbits taken from the same site. Of 50 rabbits sampled there over a period of 2 years, sera of greater than 90% reacted with B. burgdorferi antigen by ELISA and by immunoblotting. Deer ticks (I. dammini) comprised less than 10% of ticks found on rabbits. We conclude that rabbits perpetuate the agent of Lyme disease in an enzootic cycle where rabbit-feeding Ixodes are abundant, that intensity of transmission is independent of the zoonotic cycle in mice, but that infection may occasionally be exchanged between these cycles.\r"

Paraffin-embedded archival specimens from 28 patients with primary and metastatic tumors were prepared into nuclei and analyzed by flow cytometry using human lymphocyte standards. The mean DNA index was 0.82 for primary tumors and 0.83 for the metastases. Aneuploidy was found in 68 percent of primary tumors and in 82 percent of metastases. The percentage of cells in the proliferative fraction was 40.4 in the primary tumors and 24.5 in the metastases.

One patient required a secondary laryngectomy. All patients were reconstructed immediately, 11 with a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and 6 with free-tissue transfer. The operative mortality was 6 percent; the morbidity was 59 percent. At last follow-up, 53 percent of the patients were alive without disease, with a mean disease-free survival period of 36 months. Ninety-three percent of the patients regained swallowing and independent oral alimentation; 80 percent of those with laryngeal preservation regained intelligible speech.

With or without laryngectomy, excellent survival and functional results can be obtained.\r"

Patients with a tumor depth of less than 4 mm did significantly better than those with a tumor depth of greater than 4 mm; they were also more likely to have uninvolved nodes at elective radical neck dissection compared with those with a tumor depth of greater than 4 mm. However, when the survival rates of patients in the two treatment groups were compared with respect to a tumor depth of 4 mm, there was no significant difference between the hemiglossectomy and the hemiglossectomy and radical neck dissection groups. A policy of interval elective radical neck dissection only in those with a tumor depth of greater than 4 mm may optimize cure rates and avoid neck dissection in those unlikely to develop neck recurrence.\r"

Seven of them seemed to affect survival. Poor prognosis was related to (1) advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, (2) cord fixation and massive local invasion, (3) ulceration of the primary tumor, (4) lymph node metastases at diagnosis, (5) glottic lesions had a poorer prognosis than supraglottic ones, (6) locoregional recurrences, and (7) male gender. However, most of these significant differences were in disease-free survival, and only primary tumor staging; lymph node status; and locoregional recurrences affected overall survival. On the other hand, the other five variables showed no effect on either disease-free or overall survival rates. These included age, race, cell differentiation, type of recurrence, and the initial definitive therapeutic modality.\r"

Ten patients had simultaneous free bone grafts and 6 had vascularized bone grafts. There were three flap failures and four perioperative deaths. Excluding the 4 deaths, the results were assessed as excellent in 25 patients, good in 12, and poor in 2. Free-tissue transfer is a reliable method of providing enough tissue at one initial operation to satisfy complex three-dimensional defects of the orbitomaxillary region.

Cells were counted on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, and growth curves were constructed. Quercetin caused inhibition of growth in both squamous cell carcinoma lines. Effect on the fibroblast-like human lung cells was noted only at the maximum concentration. Significant growth inhibition of squamous cell carcinoma was observed in implantable cell growth chambers retrieved 3 days after quercetin treatment. Quercetin appears to possess a cytotoxic effect on squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck origin both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibitory effect on malignant cells appears to be selective and dose-dependent.\r"

Patients showed the expected depression of lymphocyte proliferation to phytohemagglutinin and had borderline depressed natural killer cell activity and relatively normal interleukin-2 production. Addition of interleukin-2 at 100 units/ml markedly enhanced natural killer cell activity to normal levels. Serum from head and neck patients was also immune-suppressive. Heat-inactivated serum depressed lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity of control leukocytes. Lymphocyte incubation with interleukin-2 significantly counteracted immune suppressive serum effects and restored depressed lymphocyte function to normal levels. The effective in vitro interleukin-2 dose is potentially achievable by infusion at approximate doses of 3 X 10(6) units/M2.\r"

Diminished natural killer cell function in these patients was associated with an increased risk of death from uncontrolled regional and distant metastases. During the assessment, the cell line MDA686-Ln was established from a metastatic pharyngeal carcinoma of a patient with low natural killer cell cytotoxicity. The initially cytotoxicity-resistant cell line could be lysed when natural killer cell cytotoxicity was enhanced in vitro either through enrichment of a Leu 19+ natural killer cell population by fluorescent-activated cell sorting or by interleukin-2 activation. Additionally, increased circulating immune complexes were identified in these patients, subsequently isolated, and found to block natural killer cell reactivity against MDA686-Ln. In light of this negative interaction, 38 patients were randomly evaluated for both circulating immune complex levels and natural killer cell function. Both parameters examined together were complementary in defining the risk of death with disease; four of five deaths occurred in patients with both high circulating immune complex levels and low natural killer cell function. Results support the biologic modification of natural killer cell activity for controlling metastatic pharyngeal carcinoma and point to the potential confounding influence of circulating immune complex.\r"

All parameningeal sites (middle ear, orbit, or nasopharynx) were excluded from further analysis; thus, 50 patients represent the cohort of head and neck sarcomas for this review. Survival was good in this group of patients, 28 of 50 being alive and disease-free at last follow-up. Twenty of the 38 patients with RMS were alive and disease-free. Similarly, 8 of the 12 patients with NRMS were disease-free at a median follow-up of 5 years. However, the site and size of the primary tumor impacted on the extent of the initial resection and further treatment in addition to surgery. Although the treatment policy evolved over time to a stage-specific strategy for treatment modalities, the data suggest that surgery alone may be sufficient initial therapy for a subset of patients. For patients in whom complete resection is not achieved, the addition of radiotherapy and chemotherapy may result in improved survival.\r"

The progressive nature of this disease occasionally results in severe tracheal compression and acute airway distress. We treated 120 patients with airway compression secondary to goiters during a 7-year period. Thirty patients presented initially with acute airway distress requiring either intubation or semiemergent surgery. The decision to operate was based primarily on clinical evaluation and airway films. Ninety patients had substernal goiters. Only one patient required sternal splitting. If one lobe was enlarged causing tracheal deviation, lobectomy was performed; if both lobes were enlarged, subtotal thyroidectomy was performed. Two patients required tracheostomy. There were no operative deaths, and morbidity was limited to minor wound problems. It is important to consider early surgical decompression whenever tracheal compression is caused by goiters, especially if the patients are symptomatic or there is mediastinal extension.\r"

Thallium-210-iodine 123 subtraction scanning proved to be the most accurate in localizing parathyroid adenomas (60 percent) but not parathyroid hyperplasia. Resection of 3 3/4 parathyroid glands in primary parathyroid hyperplasia and total parathyroidectomy with parathyroid autotransplantation in tertiary parathyroid hyperplasia are the treatments of choice and would have prevented reoperation in this group. Careful neck exploration, resection of the thymus, and even thyroidectomy would probably have led to the correct location of the missed parathyroid adenomas. Mediastinotomy should not be performed at initial surgery. A careful history and preoperative calcium and phosphorus determinations in all thyroid surgery patients will reveal occult hyperparathyroidism. Twenty-one such patients were identified in our overall parathyroid series.\r"

However, 19 of 39 children (49%) starved for over 8 hours had an aspirate of more than 0.4 ml/kg, as did five of 16 children (31%) injured 3 or more hours after eating. Thus, a 'safe' interval between oral intake and induction cannot be predicted.

The results of the peroperative cerebral monitoring were compared on completion of the study with the neuropsychometric assessments. Seventy-six percent of the patients with a significant neuropsychometric deficit after operation also showed significant peroperative changes on the analysing monitor; the majority occurred immediately after the start of perfusion. Twenty-eight patients failed to demonstrate any evidence of neuropsychometric deficit and six (21%) of these also showed significant peroperative changes. All patients whose traces demonstrated more than one significant change during the peroperative course had a significant neuropsychometric deficit afterwards.\r"

Plasma catecholamine, vasopressin and cortisol concentrations were determined from repeated blood samples. The total administered dose of propofol was 3.93 (SD 1.34) mg/kg and of diazepam 0.28 (SD 0.07) mg/kg. No cardiovascular depression or airway problems occurred. Other side effects were also rare but some discomfort on injection was frequent with propofol. Recovery times were faster after propofol than after diazepam as assessed by the Maddox wing and visual analogue scales. Propofol also provided better amnesia compared to diazepam at the time of the extraction of the teeth. Eight of the 12 patients subjectively preferred propofol sedation. There was no hormonal stress response in either group.\r"

The extent of sensory and motor blockade was also compared. The paramedian approach was associated with a lower frequency of technical problems compared to the midline approach. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between the two techniques for the following factors: repeated attempts at needle insertion; difficulty in identification of the epidural space; resistance to introduction of the catheter; resistance to injection through the epidural catheter; and the production of paraesthesiae (nine patients in the midline group compared to only one patient in the paramedian group, p less than 0.01). The catheter entered a vessel at first in two patients in each group. No significant differences were demonstrated between the groups in the extent of sensory and motor blockade. The study supports the view that the paramedian approach has technical advantages over the midline approach for lumbar epidural analgesia with catheter technique.\r"

Pressure changes were measured via the epidural catheter through which continuous infusion epidural analgesia was administered, using a pressure transducer kept at the level of the lumbar spine. The mothers moved through a series of postures that reflected those expected during the course of labour and delivery. The pressure within the catheter was recorded during these manoeuvres. The pressure changes which were found, taken in conjunction with the associated investigations of others, are consistent with the hypothesis.\r"

The induction characteristics and haemodynamic response to propofol and thiopentone were similar. Side effects were rare with both agents, but propofol caused more discomfort on injection compared to thiopentone. Recovery times were shorter after propofol as evaluated by time to orientation, recovery scoring after anaesthesia and measurements with the Maddox wing. Rapid placental transfer and significant fetal uptake were detected for propofol. There was no significant neonatal depression as assessed by Apgar scores and blood gas analyses. Propofol appears to be a suitable alternative to thiopentone as an induction agent for anaesthesia in elective Caesarean section.\r"

  ".U": "90024256\r", 
  ".W": "Elective Caesarean section deliveries over a 5-year period were studied to compare the effect of epidural block with general anaesthesia on the condition of the infant at birth. The Apgar score and umbilical arterial acid-base status were used as determinants of the latter. Epidural block was used in 139 (22.8%) mothers while 471 (77.2%) were performed under general anaesthesia. No babies in the epidural group were severely depressed (Apgar less than 4), compared with 6.2% in the general anaesthesia group. Only 4.3% of the epidural sections were moderately depressed (Apgar 4-6), compared with 15.4% of the others. These differences remained highly significant when infants of less than 2500 g were excluded, and when matched groups were compared. Mean umbilical arterial pH was similar within the two groups (pH 7.28), and was not consistent with asphyxia in almost 90% of the depressed infants. The findings suggest that general anaesthesia, rather than asphyxia or aortocaval compression, is responsible for most of the depressed infants born by elective Caesarean section. This may involve over 20% of babies delivered in this manner, so greater use of epidural block for elective Caesarean section is recommended. Further investigations are required to improve results with general anaesthesia.\r"

Management of pain with high TEA was started with the bolus epidural injection of 4.3 +/- 0.2 mL bupivacaine (5 mg/mL), which induced a sympathetic blockade from Th. During ischemic chest pain, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were significantly increased. TEA, while relieving the chest pain, significantly decreased systolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, without any significant changes in coronary perfusion pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic or pulmonary vascular resistances. In some patients, ST-segment depression was less pronounced during TEA. Thus, during ischemic chest pain, TEA has beneficial effects on the major determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, without jeopardizing coronary perfusion pressure. TEA may therefore favorably alter the oxygen supply/demand ratio within ischemic myocardial areas.\r"

Mice were given subcutaneous injections of 5 X 10(6) tumor cells from A/Jax mice and then immediately exposed to 0.5%-1.0% halothane for 1 hr without surgery (n = 7) or with surgery (midline laparotomy; n = 12). In control groups mice were also injected with tumor cells but were not exposed to prolonged halothane anesthesia. Some of them received only Sa I (n = 6), while the rest (n = 7) were also laparotomized. The rejection time of Sa I in mice exposed to halothane anesthesia was significantly longer (15.4 +/- 1.25 days) than in untreated controls (12.0 +/- 0.68 days) (P less than 0.05). In the mice exposed to halothane tumor growth was also greater. Surgical stress per se did not significantly affect growth or rejection time of Sa I (11.0 +/- 0.66 vs 12.0 +/- 0.68 days). Similarly, the combination of surgical stress with halothane anesthesia did not affect the immunosuppression associated with halothane alone (12.9 +/- 1.3 vs 15.4 +/- 1.25; P less than 0.05). The results indicate that halothane anesthesia per se may be associated with impairment of cell-mediated immunity under experimental conditions.\r"

In 22 dogs (11 treated with isoflurane 1% inspired, beginning 1 hr after LAD occlusion, and 11 control) myocardial infarct size measured postmortem after 6 hr of LAD occlusion was significantly less with isoflurane than without it, 23.4 +/- 3.8% vs 36.2 +/- 2.4% of left ventricle; regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) did not differ between groups and hemodynamic differences were slight. Fifty-two other dogs underwent two 15-min periods of LAD occlusion separated by 1 hr of reperfusion. Without isoflurane (n = 12), hemodynamic, RMBF, and regional metabolic data did not differ between the two occlusion periods. When isoflurane 1.3% inspired was administered during one of the two occlusion periods by random assignment, coronary perfusion pressure, left ventricular stroke work index, and systolic left ventricular pressure decreased more than when isoflurane was not administered. Both oxygen (O2) consumption and supply in ischemic myocardium decreased proportionately during LAD occlusion, but more so with isoflurane. Neither lactate production, potassium release, glucose extraction, nor coronary venous carbon dioxide (CO2) or O2 content differed between LAD occlusion periods with and without isoflurane. Thus, isoflurane decreased the extent of myocardial necrosis produced by LAD occlusion but neither RMBF nor metabolic indications were improved during transitory ischemia.\r"

In patients receiving the solution equilibrated to 37 degrees C, the maximum level of sensory blockade was significantly higher (T 4.6 vs T 7.5), variability was smaller (SEM 0.33 vs 0.58), and duration of the sensory level of blockade at or above T 6, T 8, and T 10 was significantly longer (56 min vs 20 min, 101 min vs 59 min, and 131 min vs 77 min, respectively). There were no significant differences with regard to onset of sensory and motor blockade or either the time needed both for the sensory level of blockade to regress two segments from its highest level and to the first lumbar segment, or the duration of complete motor blockade of the lower limbs. It is concluded that the intrathecal administration of a bupivacaine solution previously equilibrated to 37 degrees C as compared with a solution injected at room temperature results in a higher, more predictable maximum sensory level of blockade with longer duration at or above T 6, T 8, and T 10.\r"

A similar respiratory pattern of EMG activity was observed in all subjects. EAB increased rapidly at the onset of expiration, and thereafter more slowly throughout expiration. At the onset of inspiration EAB decreased abruptly, and was small during inspiration. Changes in intragastric pressures were closely related to changes in EAB. In five patients PGA and EAB waveforms were almost identical over the respiratory cycle. In one subject a biphasic change in PGA during inspiration was observed, suggesting the influence of other respiratory muscles. Abdominal muscle action results in changes in intraabdominal pressure previously attributed to diaphragmatic impairment.\r"

Patients were divided into two groups based on the development of maternal hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 100 torr or a decrease of 30% or more from the preanesthetic level. Thirteen patients (33%) developed hypotension that was corrected within 2.1 +/- 1.8 min. The pH of umbilical cord venous and arterial blood and the concentration of bupivacaine were significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in neonates of mothers in the hypotensive group than in neonates of mothers that did not develop hypotension. The results show, however, that transient maternal hypotension following epidural anesthesia does not lead to a greater placental transfer of bupivacaine due to \"ion trapping\" even though neonatal cord blood pH decreases.\r"

Ranitidine administered as a 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg normal body weight IV bolus during continuous atracurium infusion produced marked antagonism of neuromuscular paralysis. The percentage of antagonism (25 +/- 9%; n = 4; 53 +/- 19%, n = 4; and 79 +/- 9%, n = 3, respectively) was linearly related to the dose of ranitidine (r = 0.86, P less than 0.05). These results suggest that IV ranitidine has a significant anticholinesterase action against atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade.\r"

The current study details isoflurane uptake and elimination in an ex vivo model of hypothermic CPB, which uses a Scimed membrane oxygenator. Isoflurane uptake and elimination by blood are markedly delayed by the membrane oxygenator in this system. This is because the oxygenator membrane absorbs large amounts of anesthetic; the Scimed oxygenator membrane has a capacity for anesthetic equivalent to approximately 17 L of blood. As isoflurane absorption by the oxygenator may also delay anesthetic uptake and elimination in patients during CPB, further studies in human subjects are needed to define the clinical significance of anesthetic absorption by the membrane oxygenator.\r"

Hapten inhibition studies with morphine and a number of structurally-related analogues revealed that morphine and codeine were the most potent inhibitors of IgE binding to a morphine-solid phase. Nalorphine, meperidine, and methadone were also good inhibitors of IgE binding, but naltrexone, buprenorphine, and fentanyl proved to be poor inhibitors. From a detailed examination of structure-activity relationships, the authors conclude that the important structural features of the morphine allergenic (that is, IgE binding) determinant comprises the cyclohexenyl ring with a hydroxyl group at C-6 and, most important of all, a methyl substituent attached to the N atom. The authors' findings suggest that morphine analogues administered to such a patient may provoke clinical anaphylaxis. Hyoscine reacted weakly with IgE antibodies in the subject's serum, but this was thought to be due to weak cross-reaction between this compound and morphine.\r"

The authors administered isoflurane and measured its partial pressure in arterial (Pa) and venous (Pv) blood and the gas exhausted from the oxygenator (PE) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 48 min during washin. These measurements were repeated during washout, which coincided with rewarming. During washin, PE, Pa, and Pv progressively rose toward inlet gas partial pressure (PI). Equilibration of Pa with PI was 41% after 16 min, 51% after 32 min, and 57% after 48 min of washin. During washout, Pa declined to 24% of its peak after 16 min and to 13% after 32 min. Washin and washout were considerably slower in mixed venous blood. Washin of isoflurane appeared to occur more slowly during cardiopulmonary bypass than during administration via the lungs in normothermic patients, presumably because hypothermia increases tissue capacity, compensating for the effect of hemodilution that otherwise would decrease the blood/gas partition coefficient. During rewarming, washout appeared to occur as rapidly as from the lungs of normothermic patients. This may have resulted from the declining blood/gas partition coefficient (due to rewarming) and relatively limited tissue stores of isoflurane. The relationship between exhaust and arterial partial pressures was reasonably consistent; for clinical purposes, measurement of PE can be used to estimate Pa.\r"

However, the incidence of ischemia with N2O administration in similar patients with poor LV function may be different. The effects of N2O on segmental LV function, as determined by two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography, changes in the ST-segment of the electrocardiogram were compared with the effects of an equal concentration of nitrogen (N2) (crossover design) in 70 patients who required elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Of these patients, 24% had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 40%. Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed in 14 patients during the study: four while awake, seven during induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, and four during the remainder of the study (one during N2O and three during 100% oxygen; one patient had two distinct periods of ischemia). No value for LVEF could be found that would distinguish between patients who did or did not have ischemia during the study. Patients treated with beta-adrenergic blocking drugs preoperatively were less likely to develop ischemia (P less than 0.05). Preoperative calcium channel blockers made no such differences. Onset of ischemia was not closely associated with hemodynamic changes. Thus, N2O does not induce clinically detectable myocardial ischemia in patients who have coronary artery disease, and poor LV function in situations in which the effects of deepening anesthetic depth and mild depression of global myocardial function are deemed desirable or harmless.\r"

Using a lesion index scoring system for grading macroscopic and microscopic changes in the rectal pouch 10% methohexital produced a superficial mucosal lesion of significantly higher severity score than that produced by control and solutions of varying pH or osmolarities. The methohexital-induced rectal mucosal lesion had its onset within minutes of drug application to the mucosal lining, appeared to mature by 60 min and left minimal effects 24 h after mucosal contact. The lesion appeared to be due to the methohexital itself and not secondary to the alkalinity or hyperosmolarity. In summary, the authors' data in mice supports an extensive 20-yr clinical experience that 10% rectal methohexital, despite inducing a transient mucosal lesion, is free of long-term serious complication related to this lesion.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of an 8-h period of reduced colloid oncotic pressure (COP) on cerebral edema formation following cryogenic brain injury were studied in 24 normothermic, normocarbic rabbits. Anesthesia was induced with halothane and catheters inserted to permit the monitoring of arterial, right atrial, and intracranial pressures (MAP, CVP, and ICP, respectively). When surgery was complete, halothane was discontinued, 40 mg/kg of pentobarbital was given iv, and ventilation continued with 66% N2O/balance O2. A left parietal cryogenic injury was then produced using liquid N2, and the animals assigned to one of three groups. In group 1 (Control, n = 8), only maintenance lactated Ringer's solution (LR) was given for the remainder of the study. Beginning 30 min after injury, animals in the other two groups (n = 8 each) underwent 45 min of plasmapheresis (arterial phlebotomy, with packed cells returned). In group 2 (Iso-COP) separated plasma was replaced with 6% hetastarch in LR, while in group 3 (Hypo-COP), plasma was replaced with LR alone. In both groups, the volume of fluid given was adjusted to maintain MAP and CVP at baseline values. After plasmapheresis, animals subsequently received only maintenance LR. Eight and one-half hours after the injury (8 h after the start of plasmapheresis), animals were killed and the brains removed. Regional tissue specific gravities (SpGr) and water contents (%H2O) were measured respectively by microgravimetry and drying. In addition, the %H2O of samples of skeletal muscle and small bowel were determined to assess peripheral edema formation. There were no important intergroup differences in MAP, CVP, ICP, blood gases, or osmolality at any time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Propranolol, like many drugs, is used clinically as a racemic mixture. The major pharmacodynamic effects of propranolol, however, are mediated by the (-)-isomer, which is 100 times as potent as the (+)-isomer. The two isomers also differ in their pharmacokinetic characteristics. To determine whether halothane anesthesia stereo-selectively inhibits the metabolism of racemic propranolol, eight male mongrel dogs were studied. On the first day of the study, 40 mg racemic propranolol was infused into the portal vein and arterial blood samples were obtained over the following 4 h for the measurements of (+)- and (-)-propranolol concentrations by HPLC. The study was repeated 24 h later during 2 MAC halothane anesthesia, when the intrinsic clearance of total propranolol was decreased by 67.5 +/- 5%, from 6.14 +/- 1.1 1/min to 1.84 +/- 0.4 1/min (P less than 0.05). The decrease in intrinsic clearance was stereoselective, (-)-propranolol being affected to a greater extent than (+)-propranolol; thus, the decrease in the clearance of (-)-propranolol, from 10.96 +/- 2.71/min to 2.6 +/- 0.71/min (73 +/- 5%) was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than the decrease in the clearance of (+)-propranolol, (62 +/- 3%) from 4.3 +/- 0.8 1/min to 1.5 +/- 0.3 1/min. Furthermore, the ratio of the intrinsic clearance of (-)-propranolol to the intrinsic clearance of (+)-propranolol was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced by halothane anesthesia, from 2.42 +/- 0.29 to 1.69 +/- 0.11. Stereoselective inhibition of propranolol metabolism results in proportionally higher concentrations of (-)-propranolol during halothane anesthesia than are present in awake dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Changes in action potential parameters were examined at the following concentrations: fentanyl 94.6 nM, 0.19 microM, and 0.95 microM; sufentanil 8.6 nM, 86.4 nM, 0.17 microM, and 0.26 microM. Naloxone 5.5 microM was administered after maximal changes were induced by fentanyl in order to explore the possibility of an opioid receptor interaction. Action potential parameters measured were Vmax of phase 0, amplitude, overshoot, maximum diastolic potential, action potential duration at 50%, and 90% repolarization and membrane responsiveness. Fentanyl 0.19 microM and sufentanil-0.17 microM caused a significant lengthening of action potential duration at 50 and 90% repolarization, 6.4% and 7.3%, and 10.2% and 12.4%, respectively, P less than 0.05. Other action potential parameters were not significantly affected by the opioids. Naloxone 5.5 microM alone did not alter action potential characteristics and failed to reverse action potential prolongation produced by fentanyl. The authors suggest that fentanyl and sufentanil prolong action potential duration in canine cardiac Purkinje fibers via direct membrane actions.\r"

The lungs were ventilated to a PaCO2 = 30-35 mmHg with O2/air and normothermia was maintained. Intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), arterial blood gases, and pH, osmolality, and other blood chemistries were recorded. Fifteen minutes after surgery, a left parietal injury was produced with liquid N2. A MAP greater than 70-75 mmHg was maintained throughout the study, using angiotensin II as needed, and CSF was removed if severe intracranial hypertension (ICP greater than 30 mmHg) threatened to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP-ICP) below 40 mmHg. 10 h after injury, the animals were killed, and edema formation assessed by: A) the wet weight of the two hemispheres; B) water content (%H2O; wet-dry weight) of the posterior aspect of the hemispheres; and C) specific gravity (SpGr) of tissue samples taken adjacent to and distant from the lesion. Animals given pentobarbital had higher MAP's until 3 h after the lesion had been induced. There were no subsequent intergroup differences in MAP, and no differences at any time in CVP, PaO2, PaCO2, pH, total fluids, or urine output. ICP increased in all animals, but with no significant intergroup differences (ICP in halothane animals was numerically lower). There were no clear differences in the incidence of ventricular drainage (1 halothane, 5 isoflurane, 3 pentobarbital; P = 0.16). In spite of CSF drainage and angiotensin, CPP\r"

Ten minutes after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, CBF was determined using 14C-iodoantipyrine. Five coronal brain sections were analyzed to determine the area within each brain section with CBF ranges of 0-15 ml.100 g-1.min-1 and 15-23 ml.100 g-1.min-1.

In the presence of thiopental, verapamil pharmacokinetics remained essentially unchanged. In contrast, anesthesia altered verapamil hemodynamic properties. In the conscious animal verapamil infusions increased heart rate (14 +/- 3 and 27 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively), cardiac output (0.22 +/- 0.07 and 0.24 +/- 0.08, l/min, respectively) and PR interval (14 +/- 2 and 25 +/- 6 ms, respectively) and slightly decreased dP/dt (-315 +/- 114 and -419 +/- 106 mmHg/s, respectively). Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased at the low dose (-2.7 +/- 0.7 mmHg.1.min-1), and stroke volume decreased at the high dose (-4.4 +/- 0.6 ml). Yet the presence of thiopental resulted in an accentuation of verapamil-induced tachycardia (27 +/- 7 and 31 +/- 6 beats/min, respectively), and a decrease in stroke volume (-5.3 +/- 2.0 and -6.3 +/- 2.1 ml, respectively). At 3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 verapamil did not increase PR interval, cardiac output, or vasodilation. Finally, at 6 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 verapamil did not decrease dP/dt and increased renal blood flow (21.8 +/- 6.4 ml/min). These data provide evidence that the negative inotropic properties of verapamil are more pronounced in the presence of thiopental. However, the role of basal anesthesia appears to be limited.\r"

  ".W": "The synaptic effects of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane were examined in the rat hippocampus in vivo and compared with the effects of ketamine and urethane. Actions of the agents on excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotransmission were studied by observing evoked responses and long-term potentiation in the stratum pyramidale of CA1 with stimulation of the contralateral CA3 region. Long-term potentiation is a long-lasting increase in synaptic efficacy, which follows a brief stimulus train. It has been shown to be established through activation of the NMDA subclass of excitatory amino acid receptors and is thought to be involved in memory processing. Volatile anesthetics had no effect on evoked excitatory responses or on long-term potentiation. Actions of the anesthetics on inhibitory processes in the hippocampus were studied by pairing stimuli at a range of interpulse intervals. The first stimulus activated inhibitory processes that caused the response to the second stimulus to be smaller than the initial response, a phenomenon termed paired pulse depression. Paired pulse depression was significantly prolonged by the volatile anesthetics compared with that under urethane or ketamine. These results indicate that the mechanism of action of the volatile anesthetics at the hippocampal CA1 synapse does not involve amino acid-mediated excitation but does involve enhancement of inhibition.\r"
