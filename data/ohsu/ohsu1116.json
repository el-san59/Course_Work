Equal proportions of muscle tissue from jaw and limb were minced together after killing cellular elements from one source. We allowed the mince to regenerate in the bed of a fast limb muscle. Regenerates were analyzed immunocytochemically at 71 to 294 days after operation. Fibers in control regenerates containing live cells from both sources expressed fast, superfast or slow myosins, or a mixture of these myosins. In regenerates containing only one type of live cells, we detected only myosins appropriate to the live cells. Our results suggest that during regeneration the original extracellular matrix of jaw-closing or limb muscle is unable to specify the expression of superfast or fast myosins, respectively; they point to the cellular elements, probably the satellite cells, as determinants of muscle specificity during regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "In chronic experiments concerning the activity-dependent plasticity of muscle properties, a simple and noninvasive method was used for monitoring changes of twitch speed in conscious adult cats. The animals had been provided with implanted electrodes for nerve stimulation, and a hand-held force transducer was pressed against the fully extended ankle joint while single test pulses were delivered to the common peroneal nerve. In the present report, this technique for the recording of ankle twitches is subjected to critical analysis and evaluation. The measurements were highly reproducible with respect to contraction time (time-to-peak) but less so for half-relaxation time and twitch amplitude; other methods should be used for the long-term monitoring of contractile force. The total force (torque) of the ankle twitch was mainly produced by tibialis anterior (about 45%), peroneus longus (PerL; 27%) and extensor digitorum longus (23%). The ankle twitch produced by PerL alone had about the same contraction time as that of all the muscles together. Among muscles that had become changed as a result of long-term electrical stimulation there was, in general, a good correspondence between the contraction times from simple external recordings of ankle twitches and those separately measured for PerL under general anesthesia (force transducer then directly connected to PerL tendon).\r"

Quantitative motor unit analysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle was performed using a concentric needle electrode. Isometric knee extension peak torque, endurance (time to exhaustion) at 40% of maximal torque, work capacity (tension time index), and recovery of force through 10 minutes post-exhaustion were determined. Median frequency of the surface power spectrum was determined during the above testing. Power spectrum histograms were compared at the onset and termination of endurance exercise. Motor unit action potential variables did not correlate with isometric peak torque, tension time index, endurance time, recovery of strength, or with median frequency. Surface power spectrum did not differentiate postpolio from control subjects.\r"

Histochemistry and electron microscopy revealed a vacuolar myopathy with massive glycoge accumulation associated with increased neutral lipid as demonstrated on Oil Red O reactions. Pleomorphic, hypertrophic mitochondria with distortion of cristae and electron-dense deposits within the matrix were identified. Acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity was absent but associated with increased neutral maltase activity and a variable compensatory rise in activity of other lysosomal enzymes. Biochemical studies demonstrated low free carnitine, normal acylcarnitine, increased activity of carnitine palmityl and acyl transferases, and other enzymes of beta-oxidation with the notable exception of low normal beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. The explanation for the lipid accumulation is uncertain but is likely related to the combination of low carnitine concentration in muscle, low beta-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, representing a rate limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation, and nonspecific defective mitochondrial function.\r"

Results of pain SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of pain sensation and densities of small myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. In contrast, results of electric SEPs showed a positive relationship with clinical impairment of deep and tactile sensations and with densities of large myelinated fibers of the sural nerve. Therefore, pain SEPs are considered to be generated by ascending signals mediated through nociceptive receptors and A delta fibers. The pain SEP is only one noninvasive and objective method currently available to investigate a physiological condition of the sensory pathway responsible for pain sense, and is especially useful when combined with the conventional electric SEPs.\r"

One known recombinant is included in the study. The highest lod score obtained in the multilocus linkage analysis was z = 5.941 at recombination fraction theta = 0.02. The RFLP results significantly facilitated genetic counseling in problematic cases among the families studied. Although evidence could be found for linkage disequilibrium of the RFLP haplotypes formed in Finnish MD patients, our results do not exclude the possible existence of more than one ancient MD mutation in this population.\r"

An initial reproducibility study using a hand-held myometer demonstrated that this method was not useful. The Hammersmith Motor Ability Score demonstrated an increase in developmental abilities with age which was markedly different from normal. The locomotor quotient of the Griffiths' Scales demonstrated a deterioration of quotient scores and is a useful method of assessment that could be used in treatment trials involving young boys with DMD.

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Preterm delivery is the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, but efforts to address the problem are hampered by the inability to predict accurately which pregnancies are at risk. We postulated that damage to the fetal membranes may release fetal fibronectin into the cervix and vagina, giving rise to a biochemical marker for preterm delivery. METHODS. We measured fetal-fibronectin concentrations in cervical and vaginal secretions, amniotic fluid, and maternal plasma with a sensitive immunoassay using the monoclonal antibody FDC-6. Immunohistochemical studies were used to determine the distribution of fetal fibronectin in the placenta and amniochorionic membranes and to ascertain its cell of origin. RESULTS. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies (n = 163) who delivered at term rarely had cervicovaginal fetal-fibronectin concentrations above 0.05 micrograms per milliliter between 21 and 37 weeks of gestation (11 of 267 cervical samples [4 percent] and 9 of 267 vaginal samples [3 percent]. High levels of fetal fibronectin were detected in amniotic fluid and in the cervical or vaginal secretions of 93.8 percent of the women with preterm rupture of membranes (n = 65). Cervical or vaginal fetal fibronectin was also present in 50.4 percent of the women with preterm uterine contractions and intact membranes (n = 117), and its presence identified the women who delivered before term (n = 60) with a sensitivity of 81.7 percent and a specificity of 82.5 percent. In the placenta and membranes, fetal fibronectin was found at points of contact with the uterine wall. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy identifies a subgroup of women who are at high risk for preterm delivery. This phenomenon may reflect the separation of the chorion from the decidual layer of the uterus, with the release of intact or degraded chorionic components of the extracellular matrix into the cervical and vaginal secretions.\r"

The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Iron-deficiency anemia has been associated with lowered scores on tests of mental and motor development in infancy. However, the long-term developmental outcome of infants with iron deficiency is unknown, because developmental tests in infancy do not predict later intellectual functioning. METHODS. This study is a follow-up evaluation of a group of Costa Rican children whose iron status and treatment were documented in infancy. Eighty-five percent (163) of the 191 children in the original group underwent comprehensive clinical, nutritional, and psychoeducational assessments at five years of age. The developmental test battery consisted of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, the Spanish version of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery, the Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, the Goodenough-Harris Draw-a-Man Test, and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency. RESULTS. All the children had excellent hematologic status and growth at five years of age. However, children who had moderately severe iron-deficiency anemia as infants, with hemoglobin levels less than or equal to 100 g per liter, had lower scores on tests of mental and motor functioning at school entry than the rest of the children. Although these children also came from less socioeconomically advantaged homes, their test scores remained significantly lower than those of the other children after we controlled for a comprehensive set of background factors. For example, the mean (+/- SD) adjusted Woodcock-Johnson preschool cluster score for the children who had moderate anemia in infancy (n = 30) was 448.6 +/- 9.7, as compared with 452.9 +/- 9.2 for the rest of the children (n = 133) (P less than 0.01); the adjusted visual-motor integration score was 5.9 +/- 2.1, as compared with 6.7 +/- 2.3 (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Children who have iron-deficiency anemia in infancy are at risk for long-lasting developmental disadvantage as compared with their peers with better iron status.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The syndrome of progressive muscular atrophy decades after acute paralytic poliomyelitis (post-polio syndrome) is not well understood. The theory that physiologic changes and aging cause the new weakness does not explain the immunologic abnormalities reported in some patients. An alternative explanation is persistent or recurrent poliovirus infection. METHODS. We assessed the intrathecal antibody response to poliovirus and intrathecal production of interleukin-2 and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome and 67 controls (including 13 who had had poliomyelitis but had no new symptoms and 18 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Intrathecal antibody responses to measles, mumps, herpes simplex, and varicella zoster viruses were also determined. RESULTS. Oligoclonal IgM bands specific to poliovirus were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 of the 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome (58 percent) but in none of the control group (P less than 0.0001). In quantitative studies there was evidence of increased intrathecal synthesis of IgM antibodies to poliovirus only among the patients with the post-polio syndrome; there was no increased synthesis of IgM to measles, mumps, herpes simplex, or varicella zoster viruses. The patients with post-polio syndrome had significantly higher mean (+/- SD) (cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-2 and soluble interleukin-2 receptors than the controls (8.1 +/- 5.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.8 U per milliliter and 159.6 +/- 102.9 vs. 10.7 +/- 6.2 U per milliliter, respectively). The intrathecal synthesis of IgM antibodies to poliovirus correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of interleukin-2 (P less than 0.0005) and soluble interleukin-2 receptors (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. An intrathecal immune response against poliovirus is present in many patients with the post-polio syndrome. In some of these patients the recrudescence of muscle weakness may be caused by persistent or recurrent infection of neural cells with the poliovirus.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The effect of postmenopausal estrogen therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Our 1985 report in the Journal, based on four years of follow-up, suggested that estrogen therapy reduced the risk of coronary heart disease, but a report published simultaneously from the Framingham Study suggested that the risk was increased. In addition, studies of the effect of estrogens on stroke have yielded conflicting results. METHODS. We followed 48,470 postmenopausal women, 30 to 63 years old, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, and who did not have a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease at base line. During up to 10 years of follow-up (337,854 person-years), we documented 224 strokes, 405 cases of major coronary disease (nonfatal myocardial infarctions or deaths from coronary causes), and 1263 deaths from all causes. RESULTS. After adjustment for age and other risk factors, the overall relative risk of major coronary disease in women currently taking estrogen was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.80); the risk was significantly reduced among women with either natural or surgical menopause. We observed no effect of the duration of estrogen use independent of age. The findings were similar in analyses limited to women who had recently visited their physicians (relative risk, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.66) and in a low-risk group that excluded women reporting current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or a Quetelet index above the 90th percentile (relative risk, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.91). The relative risk for current and former users of estrogen as compared with those who had never used it was 0.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.00) for total mortality and 0.72 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.95) for mortality from cardiovascular disease. The relative risk of stroke when current users were compared with those who had never used estrogen was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.45), with no marked differences according to type of stroke. CONCLUSIONS. Current estrogen use is associated with a reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease as well as in mortality from cardiovascular disease, but it is not associated with any change in the risk of stroke.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Chagas' heart disease is believed to be rare in the United States, although many persons from countries where the disease is endemic reside here. We performed a retrospective case review and prospective follow-up of 25 patients with Chagas' heart disease and no obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography. RESULTS. The patients mainly presented with symptomatic atrioventricular block, congestive heart failure, anginal chest pain, sudden death averted by resuscitation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of the 25 patients, 18 had been treated for coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy for up to 108 months before the diagnosis of Chagas' disease was considered. The electrocardiograms frequently suggested coronary artery disease. Six of the seven patients who had exercise thallium-perfusion scans had abnormalities suggesting ischemia or infarction. A left ventricular aneurysm was found in 14 of the 25 patients, segmental akinesia or hypokinesia in 5, and diffuse hypokinesia in 3. Programmed ventricular stimulation performed in 13 patients induced sustained ventricular tachycardia in 9 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 2. Actuarial survival (mean +/- SE) after four years for the entire group was 56 +/- 12 percent; it was 32 +/- 16 percent among those with global left ventricular dysfunction, and 78 +/- 14 percent among those without such dysfunction (P = 0.03). Only patients with left ventricular dysfunction or an aneurysm died (four-year survival, 45 +/- 14 percent, as compared with 100 percent for the remaining patients; P = 0.0002). Heart failure and left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction were the only independent predictors of death. Nine patients required permanent pacemakers. CONCLUSIONS. In the United States, Chagas' heart disease commonly mimics coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The prognosis is poor for patients with heart failure or left ventricular aneurysm or dysfunction. The disease may be underdiagnosed in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen in blood to screen for cystic fibrosis, we performed this test in 279,399 newborns in Colorado from 1982 to 1987. METHODS. Immunoreactive trypsinogen was measured in dried blood spots when the infants were 1 to 4 days old; if the level was elevated (greater than or equal to 140 micrograms per liter), the measurement was repeated (mean age, 38 days); if the level was again elevated, sweat testing was performed (mean age, 49 days). For the second test, two cutoff levels (120 and 80 micrograms per liter) were evaluated. RESULTS. We found an incidence of cystic fibrosis of 1 in 3827 (0.26 per 1000), with 3.2 newborns per 1000 requiring repeat measurement. When adjusted for race and compliance with testing, the incidence among the white infants (1 in 2521) was close to the expected incidence. The false positive rate with the initial cutoff level (92.2 percent) was similar to the rate found in neonatal screening programs for other diseases. False negative results occurred because of laboratory error or changes in procedure (three infants) and trypsinogen concentrations lower than the initial cutoff level (three infants) or lower than the remeasurement cutoff level of 120 micrograms per liter (one infant). Sweat tests were negative in 168 infants with an elevated initial trypsinogen level but a level below 80 micrograms per liter on remeasurement, confirming the value of 80 micrograms per liter as an appropriate cutoff for repeat-test results. Overall, 95.2 percent of the infants with cystic fibrosis (95 percent confidence interval, 85 to 99 percent) who did not have meconium ileus could be identified with the use of a trypsinogen cutoff level of 140 micrograms per liter on initial testing and 80 micrograms per liter on repeat testing. CONCLUSIONS. Statewide screening for cystic fibrosis based on measurements of immunoreactive trypsinogen in dried blood spots is feasible and can be implemented with acceptable rates of repeat testing and false positive and false negative results.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Employee-assistance programs sponsored by companies or labor unions identify workers who abuse alcohol and refer them for care, often to inpatient rehabilitation programs. Yet the effectiveness of inpatient treatment, as compared with a variety of less intensive alternatives, has repeatedly been called into question. In this study, anchored in the work site, we compared the effectiveness of mandatory in-hospital treatment with that of required attendance at the meetings of a self-help group and a choice of treatment options. METHODS. We randomly assigned a series of 227 workers newly identified as abusing alcohol to one of three rehabilitation regimens: compulsory inpatient treatment, compulsory attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and a choice of options. Inpatient backup was provided if needed. The groups were compared in terms of 12 job-performance variables and 12 measures of drinking and drug use during a two-year follow-up period. RESULTS. All three groups improved, and no significant differences were found among the groups in job-related outcome variables. On seven measures of drinking and drug use, however, we found significant differences at several follow-up assessments. The hospital group fared best and that assigned to AA the least well; those allowed to choose a program had intermediate outcomes. Additional inpatient treatment was required significantly more often (P less than 0.0001) by the AA group (63 percent) and the choice group (38 percent) than by subjects assigned to initial treatment in the hospital (23 percent). The differences among the groups were especially pronounced for workers who had used cocaine within six months before study entry. The estimated costs of inpatient treatment for the AA and choice groups averaged only 10 percent less than the costs for the hospital group because of their higher rates of additional treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Even for employed problem drinkers who are not abusing drugs and who have no serious medical problems, an initial referral to AA alone or a choice of programs, although less costly than inpatient care, involves more risk than compulsory inpatient treatment and should be accompanied by close monitoring for signs of incipient relapse.\r"

The present study extends the follow-up period to 3 years in 19 of the 25 original patients. Clinical examinations, lateral plain x-rays, and CT scans without contrast enhancement of the operated disc were repeated. The results indicate a decrease or even a disappearance of the hyperdense extradural material thought to represent fibrosis. An image suggestive of persistent disc herniation was still present in 5 of 8 patients with this finding on early postoperative CT scans. Persistent intradiscal gas was seen in nearly half of the patients. Total normalization of the posterior extraspinal structures was the rule. There was no correlation between CT appearance and residual complaints of the patients. CT scans without contrast enhancement may be sufficient to guide the surgeon in postoperative patients with massive signs and symptoms of recurrent root compression in whom a second operation is indicated on clinical grounds. In all other cases, myelography followed by CT scans is considered appropriate to investigate failed back surgery syndrome.\r"

Because these findings are clearly different from those previously reported, large benign cysts of the pineal gland, or at least some of them, may constitute a new pathological entity. It is important to consider this possible pathological diagnosis when dealing with pineal cysts.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging, however, showed bilateral contusions of the inferior colliculi, providing objective evidence for an organic cause of hearing loss. Auditory brain stem evoked responses and stapedial reflexes also provided objective evidence of brain stem injury. This case illustrates the phenomenon of dorsal midbrain injury after head trauma. It indicates the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for small focal lesions after head trauma, and it demonstrates some difficulties in the diagnosis of \"hysterical\" deafness.\r"

An emergency laminectomy was performed, and a large, free, subligamentous disc fragment was removed. The patient subsequently regained L5 sensorimotor function. The postoperative development of lumbar radiculopathy is an uncommon complication of Harrington rod instrumentation that may result from several biomechanical features of the instrumentation. These injuries may not be detected by intraoperative monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, and therefore, the postoperative neurological examination assumes a crucial role in the early diagnosis of these lesions. As our case demonstrates, these radicular deficits may be reversible if their cause is promptly recognized and treated.\r"

The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst. Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst.\r"

Forty-eight female Wistar rats were divided into four groups. The control group (Group 1) received 1 ml of 5% dextrose. The other three groups received three different doses of BCNU dissolved in 5% dextrose: Group II rats received 1 mg, Group III 3 mg, and Group IV 10 mg. The tracer study was performed on Day 1 or Days 4 to 12 after intracarotid administration of BCNU. In 11 rats in Group II, there were no changes of BBB permeability. Transient BBB permeability changes were seen in the striatum or hippocampus in 3 of the 5 rats (60%) in Group III within 24 hours. In 8 of 9 rats (89%) in the same group, late BBB permeability changes were observed in the hypothalamus with or without histological changes. BBB permeability changes were seen in all rats of Group IV. Focal increase of local cerebral blood flow on the infused side compared with the non-infused side of the brain was observed, although not at a significant level, in 5 of 25 rats examined with [18F]fluoroantipyrine. The results of BBB permeability and histological examinations and study of heterogenous distribution by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose indicated that the ipsilateral subcortical structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, internal capsule, and caudate putamen have the highest incidence of neurotoxicity, which are closely related to histopathological damage seen in human BCNU leucoencephalopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The surgical retractor is held and manipulated using a PUMA 200 robot. The position and orientation of the surgical retractor is displayed on the three-dimensional display. Preoperative planning and simulation are important features of this system. Movement of the brain after removal of the tumor and cerebrospinal fluid is substantial, so the tumor removal is based on visually defined margins. Enhanced computer graphics and robotic devices are important adjuncts to neurosurgical procedures and will find increasing use in the future.\r"

  ".U": "91333749\r", 
  ".W": "Despite conventional multimodality treatment (surgery and fractionated radiation therapy), recurrence and clinical progression of cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas are common. The malignant behavior of these tumors is a result of their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate. To explore the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of these skull base neoplasms, we assessed its use in four patients with chordoma and two with chondrosarcoma. In five of the patients, radiosurgery was used as adjuvant therapy for residual or recurrent tumors after surgical debulking, and in one patient with a chordoma, it was the primary treatment. No patient received fractionated external beam radiotherapy. All tumors were less than 30 mm in diameter and were treated with 20 Gy to the tumor margin. Skull base computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were essential to define the anatomic relationships between tumor and adjacent basal structures. During follow-up (mean, 22 mo; range, 8-36 mo), we found no progression of the treated tumor volume in any patient. Neurological deficits before treatment improved in three patients; the other three patients remained in stable neurological condition. Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated that two patients showed reduction in tumor size and four patients had no tumor growth. In one patient, a metastatic parietal lobe chondrosarcoma developed and was treated by microsurgery. Another patient showed tumor progression outside of the radiosurgical treatment volume. Our results attest to the value of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjuvant or primary treatment for selected patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma and demonstrate its potential advantages over standard fractionated irradiation. Analysis of the long-term clinical and imaging effects after radiosurgery is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "The anterior and posterior pituitary lobes (AL and PL, respectively) are assumed to differ in the type of vascular supply and structure of their microvascular networks. Animal experiments have shown that the pituitary microvascular flow differs between the two lobes, being extremely high in the PL and low in the AL. For technical reasons, it has hitherto not been possible to study pituitary microflow in humans. Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is now a well-established method for real-time monitoring of microcirculation, applicable also in humans. In a prospective clinical study, the microflow in the AL and PL was measured during transsphenoidal microsurgery in 52 patients with adenomas of different size, growth characteristics, and endocrinological activity. The mean microflow in the PL (177.7 +/- 12.6 [flux]) was found to be about six times higher than that in the AL (27.4 +/- 2.7 [flux]). No difference in the laser-Doppler fractional volume of the lobes could be detected (0.73 +/- 0.06 [] vs. 0.77 +/- 0.07 [], where [] designates the ratio of the alternating current output to the direct current output signals). Microflow within the pituitary lobes was influenced neither by the histological type nor the size of the adenoma. Additionally, LDF signal-averaging triggered by the electrocardiogram allowed detection of different characteristic pulsatile microvascular flow patterns in the AL and PL. Our findings provide strong physiological support for the idea that the angioarchitecture of the pituitary lobes differs. With this method, the AL and PL can be identified objectively during surgery. LDF might provide useful information concerning intraoperative surgical approach.\r"

  ".U": "91333751\r", 
  ".W": "The extent of resection was assessed in 94 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for medically intractable complex partial seizures originating from a unilateral seizure focus in the anteromesial temporal lobe. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the coronal plane was used to quantify the extent of resection of lateral and mesiobasal structures according to a 20-compartment model of the temporal lobe. Successful seizure outcome (greater than or equal to 90% reduction in seizure frequency) was accomplished in 83% of the patients (all followed up for more than 1 year; mean duration of follow-up, 25.2 months) and correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection, regardless of the extent of resection of lateral structures. Successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 81% of the patients with no structural lesions, and also correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection regardless of the extent of lateral resection. A successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 90% of the 21 patients with structural lesions documented by neuroimaging studies. Two patients who underwent extensive lobectomy without resection of the structural lesion had no reduction in seizure frequency postoperatively. We conclude that the most important factor in determining the outcome of temporal lobectomy in patients with unilateral anteromesial temporal lobe epileptogenicity is the extent of resection of structures in the mesiobasal temporal lobe. In patients with structural lesions, lesion resection may be an added contributor to successful seizure outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Transtentorial herniation is an ominous finding in the patient with head injuries. We report our experience with 10 patients suffering from acute transtentorial herniation secondary to posttraumatic unilateral hemispheric swelling who were treated aggressively with temporal lobectomy. Eight patients were men and 2 were women. Their ages ranged from 22 to 61 years, with a mean of 37 years. Their preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranged from 3 to 6, with a mean of 4. All patients had both computed tomographic and clinical evidence of unilateral hemispheric shift and acute herniation without a significant subdural or epidural hematoma. Seven patients had unilateral nonreactive pupils and 3 had bilateral nonreactive pupils. All were taken to the operating room within 2 hours of clinical signs of herniation. Complete unilateral temporal lobectomies including the mesial structures, amygdala, and uncus were performed. In this series, the mortality rate was 30%, including a single patient who was neurologically stable but died from nonneurological injuries. Of the 7 survivors, 4 were functionally independent and 3 required minimal assistance with the activities of daily living. Aggressive, early decompression via complete temporal lobectomy may thus significantly improve the outcome in patients with transtentorial herniation accompanying posttraumatic hemispheric swelling and midline shift.\r"

Fifty patients (42%) underwent surgery. Twenty-eight patients (23%) had a good recovery, 19 (16%) were moderately disabled, 6 (5%) were severely disabled, and 67 (56%) died. All patients who were alert and awake with a normal or near normal neurological examination at the time of admission survived with a good outcome. All but 4 patients who were comatose at the time of admission died. Nine patients, however, who were not comatose at the time of admission died from potentially preventable causes. In 3 of these patients, a more aggressive diagnostic approach (including cerebral angiography) may have altered their ultimate outcome. An expeditious approach to the trauma victim with a comprehensive management scheme after injury may have altered the course in the remainder of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Intraspinal narcotic (usually intrathecal morphine) infusions with implanted pumps are increasingly used in patients with intractable chronic pain not caused by cancer. In some patients, pain control is difficult with infusions of morphine. Seven patients with diagnoses of arachnoiditis, epidural scarring, and/or vertebral body compression fracture were treated with alternative solutions in an epidural route. For maximal flexibility, Medtronic implanted programmable infusion pumps with catheters to T6-T10 were used, and pain was monitored by verbal pain scales. In three patients, epidural infusions of morphine in 0.5% bupivacaine (MS-MARC) resulted in little or no pain relief without significant side effects (e.g., headache, nausea, or vomiting). In these same patients, epidural infusions of sufentanil citrate resulted in pain scale reductions of 92%, 82%, and 40%, respectively, with no side effects. Four other patients found more effective pain relief when switched from initial sufentanil citrate infusions to MS-MARC. Pain scale reductions (with no side effects) were 92%, 76%, 59%, and 47% in these patients. Pain relief and minimal side effects with sufentanil citrate is theorized to result from its higher lipophilicity promoting local transdural diffusion to spinal cord and limiting upward diffusion to the brain stem. Sufentanil citrate is also advantageous for programmable pumps because it is 100 times more potent than morphine and therefore allows longer pump refill times and higher infusion doses. Although this study was done on a limited number of patients, sufentanil citrate and MS-MARC in epidural infusions using programmable infusion pumps for non-cancer patients provide significant alternative drug combinations and routes.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital brain tumors have been reported infrequently and their management remains ill defined. An 11-year review (1977-1987) of all children with brain tumors with the onset of symptoms before 1 year of age was completed. Twenty-two children with the following histological diagnoses were treated: astrocytoma (7 patients), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (6 patients), papilloma or carcinoma of the choroid plexus (3 patients), malignant teratoma (2 patients), dermoid tumor (2 patients), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient), and chloroma (1 patient). Fifteen tumors were supratentorial in location, and 7 were infratentorial. Initial symptoms were hydrocephalus (32%), focal neurological deficit (23%), asymptomatic increase in head circumference (18%), failure to thrive (14%), and seizures (4.5%). The goal of treatment was a radical excision when possible, with primary chemotherapy in the last 6 years of the review period. Radiation therapy was the adjunct to surgery in the initial 5-year period. All patients with papillomas of the choroid plexus and dermoid lesions underwent a total resection with no recurrence. All 7 astrocytomas were supratentorial, with 6 occurring in the diencephalon. Five of the seven patients with astrocytomas survived more than 5 years. The 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors were located equally between the supra- and infratentorial spaces. Four of the 6 infants with these tumors received chemotherapy (2 received chemotherapy alone; 2 received chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and are tumor free 2 to 9 years later. A fifth child received radiation therapy alone early in the series and survived only 4 months. The family of the other child refused adjunctive treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were monitored during 53 procedures for aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). \"Significant\" changes were reported to the surgeon, who took corrective action when possible. Changes in the SEPs were categorized as follows: Type I, no change; Type II, significant change with complete return to baseline; Type III, significant change with incomplete return to baseline; Type IV, complete loss with no return; and Type V, no response at baseline. Only 1 of 37 patients with a Type I SEP had a new neurological deficit, and this was a patient who could not be examined for several days after surgery because he was in a pentobarbital coma. All 4 patients with Type III and IV changes had new postoperative neurological deficits. Perhaps of greater importance, 4 of 5 patients with Type II changes had no new deficit. These patients all had changes in SEPs that were completely reversible by clip adjustment (2), prompt removal of temporary clips (1), and inducing hypertension after aneurysm trapping (1). These cases may, therefore, represent instances in which SEP monitoring allowed the clinicians to prevent a neurological deficit. The MCA supplies the area of the somatosensory cortex that controls the hand. Median nerve SEPs are, therefore, a theoretically ideal monitor during surgery for MCA aneurysms. This study suggests that the results of MCA aneurysm surgery may be accurately predicted and improved with SEP monitoring.\r"

Typical clinical features seen with dissection include unilateral headache, oculosympathetic palsy, amaurosis fugax, and symptoms of focal brain ischemia. The diagnosis of carotid or intracranial dissection is usually best confirmed by angiography, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have been shown to visualize intimal dissection. The prognosis in cases of spontaneous dissection is generally benign unless the initial manifestation involves infarction with substantial deficit. The best approach to treatment appears to be the administration of the anticoagulant, heparin, followed by warfarin or antiplatelet therapy. Surgical intervention is reserved for cases of progressive or recurrent ischemic complication that occurs despite the administration of adequate doses of anticoagulants.\r"

Recent studies have shown convincingly that plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice for nonpregnant patients acutely ill with Guillain-Barre syndrome, but data regarding its use in pregnancy are limited. We report three patients, two of whom had positive cytomegalovirus titers, in whom aggressive plasmapheresis prevented the need for ventilatory support and its inherent increase in maternal morbidity and mortality.\r"

Serial plasmaphereses and oral prednisone therapy were used in an attempt to depress maternal anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers. As anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers fell, fetal breathing movements became apparent by ultrasound, and as these titers rose, no fetal breathing movements were apparent. Our patient delivered an infant with transient neonatal myasthenia but normal pulmonary development and no deformations.

Two cases are presented of placenta previa percreta with involvement of the urinary bladder necessitating cesarean hysterectomy, partial cystectomy, and, in one case, bilateral ureteral reimplantation. Both patients had two previous cesarean deliveries. Serious hemorrhage is common in patients with placenta percreta. The primary goal of surgical management must be to control bleeding, which usually requires resection of all tissue involved by the infiltrating placenta. After hemorrhage is controlled, the surgeon must reestablish the integrity of the urinary system and reconstruct the pelvis as necessary.\r"

This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin. We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation. Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery. We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC. This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented.\r"

This case suggests that direct fetal therapy is of value in the treatment of some fetuses with supraventricular tachycardia, and lends further evidence that the role of transplacental digoxin therapy is limited in the compromised fetus. It also demonstrates that resolution of hydrops may require a prolonged period.\r"

Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea. Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os. By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished. The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child. Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful. The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small. However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders. A strategy to this end is proposed.\r"

The serum levels were elevated in each case, to 26.9, 5.1, and 3.2 ng/mL, respectively, and rapidly dropped to within the normal range after treatment. All patients are recovered and show no evidence of recurrence, and the levels of serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen have remained within normal limits. These results suggest that measurement of the serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen level may be useful in diagnosing an early-stage primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in a mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. An elevated preoperative serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen may indicate the need for a rapid pathologic examination of the tumor to look for malignant elements and may influence the surgical regimen.\r"

A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion.\r"

It is especially prevalent in children younger than 2 years of age. Furthermore, the earlier the first episode of OM, the greater the risk of subsequent recurrent OM and chronic otitis media with effusion. In addition, a number of other host, agent, and environmental factors have been associated with increased risk of otitis media. Environmental factors that favor the transmission of upper respiratory pathogens increase the risk of OM, recurrent OM, and chronic OME with effusion. Several factors suggest a genetic role in OM susceptibility, which needs further exploration.\r"

Despite a number of clinical and pathologic works dealing with this common problem, animal studies searching for possible relationships between the middle ear inflammation and cochlear function remain insufficient. Bacterial inoculation and ototoxins and inflammatory products in the middle ear cavity cause SNHL in rodents. Human serum albumin placed in the middle ear cavity in chinchillas also produces SNHL, owing to the effects of nonspecific inflammation in the middle ear cavity. Most of the middle ear inflammatory mediators enter the inner ear through the round window route, and alteration of the permeability of the round window membrane plays an important role in causing cochlear dysfunction. Although an immunologic response in the middle ear plays an important role in otitis media, the immunologic response in the inner ear as it relates to middle ear inflammatory mediators requires further study.\r"

Pityriasis alba usually presents as ill defined, scaly patches of hypomelanosis on the cheeks of children with an atopic diathesis. The face is also a favored site for vitiligo, but the distribution is periorificial, and the pigment loss is complete because of a destruction of melanocytes. Vitiligo is an acquired, progressive disorder in contrast to nevus depigmentosus, which is a stable, congenital leukoderma. The localized form of nevus depigmentosus must be distinguished from an ash leaf spot, the earliest cutaneous manifestation of tuberous sclerosis, whereas the systematized form may be confused with hypomelanosis of Ito, another neurocutaneous disorder. The lesions of tinea versicolor favor the upper trunk of adolescents, and potassium hydroxide examination of the associated scale reveals hyphal and yeast forms of P. orbiculare. Any inflammatory process in the skin such as dermatitis or psoriasis can resolve with areas of hypopigmentation.\r"

To examine the functional importance of the highly conserved spacing between the leucine zipper and the basic region, we have analyzed the DNA-binding ability of yeast GCN4 proteins containing amino acid insertions between these two subdomains. Proteins containing a surprisingly wide variety of seven-amino acid insertions, but none containing two-, four-, or six-amino acid insertions, are functional. However, heterodimers between wild-type GCN4 and functional derivatives containing seven amino acid insertions are unable to bind DNA. These observations provide strong experimental support for several aspects of the scissors grip and induced fork models for DNA-binding by bZIP proteins. Specifically, they demonstrate that continuous alpha-helices symmetrically diverging from the leucine zipper correctly position the two basic regions for specific binding to abutting DNA half-sites. In addition, the results indicate that GCN4 homodimers are primarily responsible for transcriptional activation in yeast cells.\r"

We have isolated recombinant DNA clones for a human HSF (HSF1) by screening cDNA libraries with a human cDNA fragment. The human HSF1 probe was produced by the PCR with primers deduced from conserved amino acids in the Drosophila and yeast HSF sequences. The human HSF1 mRNA is constitutively expressed in HeLa cells under nonshock conditions and encodes a protein with four conserved leucine zipper motifs. Like its counterpart in Drosophila, human HSF1 produced in Escherichia coli in the absence of heat shock is active as a DNA binding transcription factor, suggesting that the intrinsic activity of HSF is under negative control in human cells. Surprisingly, an independently isolated human HSF clone, HSF2, is related to but significantly different from HSF1 [Schuetz, T. J., Gallo, G. J., Sheldon, L., Tempst, P. & Kingston, R. E.

We report the purification to homogeneity and the partial peptide sequence of HSF from HeLa cells. The peptide sequence was used to isolate a human cDNA with a predicted open reading frame that has homology to the DNA binding domains of both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila HSFs. The cDNA directs the synthesis of a protein that binds to the heat shock element with specificity identical to HeLa HSF and stimulates transcription from a heat shock promoter. The expressed protein cross-reacts with anti-HSF antibodies. Surprisingly, however, this cDNA does not encode all of the peptides obtained from purified HeLa HSF. These peptides are encoded by a distinct human cDNA, HSF1, described by Rabindran et al. [Rabindran, S. K., Giorgi, G., Clos, J. & Wu, C. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 6906-6910.] It therefore appears that there is a human heat shock factor gene family and that at least two separate but related HSF proteins regulate the stress response in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The three-dimensional structures of native bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) and its complex with bestatin, a slow-binding inhibitor, have been solved and exhaustively refined. The mode of binding of bestatin to leucine aminopeptidase may be similar to that of a tetrahedral intermediate that is thought to form during peptide bond hydrolysis. Bestatin binds in the active site with its alpha-amino group and hydroxyl group coordinated to the zinc ion located in the readily exchangeable divalent cation binding site. Its phenylalanyl side chain is stabilized by van der Waals interactions with Met-270, Thr-359, Gly-362, Ala-451, and Met-454, which appear to form a terminal hydrophobic pocket. The leucyl side chain binds in another hydrophobic cleft lined by Asn-330, Ala-333, and Ile-421. Hydrogen bonds involving active site residues Lys-262, Asp-273, Gly-360, and Leu-362 are responsible for stabilizing the backbone nitrogen and oxygen atoms of bestatin. The mode of bestatin inhibition of leucine aminopeptidase is discussed and correlated with biochemical studies of bestatin analogues. In addition, features of a mechanism of catalysis of peptide hydrolysis by leucine aminopeptidase are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91334379\r", 
  ".W": "Kinetic and thermodynamic factors that determine specificity of RNA cleavage by ribozymes are illustrated with examples from recent work with a ribozyme derived from the group I intron of Tetrahymena thermophila pre-rRNA. The conclusions also apply to other ribozymes, to antisense oligonucleotide experiments, and to RNA and DNA cleavage agents that can recognize a single-stranded or double-stranded region of variable length. At first, adding bases to a ribozyme's recognition sequence is expected to increase cleavage of the target RNA relative to cleavage of other RNAs. However, adding more bases ultimately reduces this discrimination, as cleavage occurs essentially every time the target RNA or a mismatched RNA binds the ribozyme. This occurs despite the weaker binding of the mismatched RNA because dissociation becomes too slow (binding is too strong) to allow the ribozyme to \"choose\" between cleavage of the target RNA and a mismatched RNA. In summary, more (base pairing) isn't always better, because maximal discrimination requires equilibrium binding prior to cleavage. The maximum discrimination that can be obtained is expected to be greater with an A + U-rich recognition sequence than with a G + C-rich recognition sequence. This is because the weaker A.U base pairs (relative to G-C base pairs) allow recognition to be spread over a larger number of bases while preventing binding that is too strong. Finally, creating an A-rich ribozyme rather than a U-rich ribozyme avoids the loss in discrimination expected with U-rich ribozymes from the formation of U.G wobble pairs in addition to the \"targeted\" Watson-Crick U.A pair.\r"

  ".W": "A human keratinocyte cDNA expression library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 was screened with the purified IgG fraction of serum from a patient with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, which had a high titer of anti-type VII collagen antibodies. Screening of approximately 3 x 10(5) plaques identified 8 positive clones, the largest one (K-131) being approximately 1.9 kilobases in size. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing of K-131 indicated that it consisted of 1875 base pairs and contained an open reading frame coding for a putative N-terminal noncollagenous domain of 439 amino acids and a collagenous C-terminal segment of 186 amino acids. The collagenous domain was characterized by repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences that were interrupted in several positions by insertions or deletions of 1-3 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence also revealed a peptide segment that had a high degree of identity with a published type VII collagen protein sequence. Northern hybridization of the K-131 cDNA with human epidermal keratinocyte and skin fibroblast RNA revealed an mRNA of approximately 8.5 kilobases. The fusion protein produced by the K-131 cDNA, when incubated with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita serum, bound to antibodies that reacted in Western blots with type VII collagen. The genomic location of the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) was determined by chromosomal in situ hybridization with the K-131 cDNA. The results mapped the COL7A1 to the locus 3p21. The cDNA clones characterized in this study will be valuable for understanding the protein structure and gene expression of type VII collagen present in anchoring fibrils and its aberrations in the dystrophic forms of heritable epidermolysis bullosa.\r"

  ".W": "The cAMP-dependent regulation of ion channels was studied by using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. In isolated cardiac ventricular myocytes, the beta-adrenergically regulated Cl- current (ICl) exhibited an unusual dependence on Na+, such that replacement of extracellular Na+ with compounds such as tetramethylammonium, choline, Tris, or N-methyl-D-glucamine resulted in a reduction in current amplitude without changing the reversal potential. Replacement of extracellular Na+ with tetramethylammonium also reduced the magnitude of the beta-adrenergically enhanced Ca2+ current and delayed rectifier K+ current, suggesting that removal of Na+ was affecting the cAMP pathway that regulates all three currents. Replacement of extracellular Na+ also reduced ICl that was stimulated by (i) direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin, (ii) inhibition of phosphodiesterase with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, (iii) exposure to the membrane-permeable cAMP derivative 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, or (iv) direct phosphorylation of the channel with protein kinase A catalytic subunit. This suggests that the Na+ dependence is at a point beyond the activation of protein kinase A. The Na+ dependence of ICl regulation could not be explained by changes in intracellular Ca2+. However, the sensitivity of the ICl to changes in extracellular Na+ depended significantly on the intracellular Na+ concentration, suggesting that intracellular Na+ plays an important role in the cAMP-dependent regulation of ion channels.\r"

Five partial cDNAs were obtained and designated PsPK1 through PsPK5 (for Pisum sativum protein kinase) in order of decreasing length. The deduced amino acid sequences show that each member of the PsPK series is different in length, and, although their sequences are quite similar overall, each has a unique sequence. Moreover, each member of the PsPK series has structural features typical of members of the protein-serine/threonine kinase family of protein kinases. All are equally similar to cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, suggesting that the pea homologs may be involved in signal transduction. DNA gel blots show that each PsPK cDNA is likely to be encoded by a single gene within the pea genome. RNA blot analyses show that the PsPK transcripts accumulate differentially during greening of etiolated seedlings. PsPK3 and PsPK5 transcripts show a large and rapid decline during deetiolation. In contrast, the level of PsPK4 RNA increases steadily during deetiolation whereas PsPK1 and PsPK2 transcripts show little change during the greening period. Thus light regulates changes in the levels of transcripts encoding putative protein kinases in plants.\r"

BCL2 is restricted within germinal centers to the follicular mantle and to portions of the light zone implicated in the selection and maintenance of plasma cells and memory B cells. BCL2 is present in the surviving T cells in the thymic medulla. All hematopoietic lineages that derive from a renewing stem cell also display BCL2. A limited number of nonlymphoid tissues demonstrate BCL2 and can be grouped as (i) glandular epithelium in which hormones or growth factors regulate hyperplasia and involution, (ii) complex differentiating epithelium such as skin and intestine characterized by long-lived stem cells, and (iii) long-lived postmitotic cells such as neurons. Within these tissues that demonstrate apoptotic cell turnover, BCL2 is often topographically restricted to long-lived or proliferating cell zones.

Substitution of defined areas of the encephalic neuroepithelium in normal chicken embryos at 2 days of incubation by their counterparts from homozygous F.Epi embryos generates the epileptic phenotype in the chimeras. It was found that grafting primordia of both prosencephalon and mesencephalon of homozygous F.Epi birds is necessary and sufficient for transfer of the full disease. When grafted alone, the homozygous F.Epi prosencephalon, although showing the typical epileptic interictal electroencephalogram, does not allow the complete epileptic seizures to occur in the hosts. Grafts of mesencephalon and/or rhombencephalon modify neither the behavior nor the electroencephalographic pattern of the recipient chickens. Cooperation of forebrain and midbrain activities is therefore required to yield epileptic seizures in this model.\r"

To elucidate the elements that maintain sodium channel distribution at the apical membrane, we searched for specific proteins associating with the channel. Triton X-100 extraction of A6 epithelial cells reveals that sodium channels are associated with detergent-insoluble and assembled cytoskeleton. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy show that sodium channels are segregated to the apical microvillar membrane and colocalize with ankyrin, fodrin, and actin. We document by immunoblot analysis that ankyrin and fodrin remain associated with sodium channels after isolation and purification from bovine renal papillae. 125I-labeled ankyrine can be precipitated by anti-sodium-channel antibodies only in the presence of purified bovine sodium-channel complex. Direct binding of 125I-labeled ankyrin shows ankyrin binds to the 150-kDa subunit of the channel. Fluorescence photobleach lateral-diffusion measurements indicate sodium channels are severely restricted in their lateral mobility. We conclude that ankyrin links the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel to the underlying cytoskeleton and this association may sequester sodium channels at apical microvilli and maintain their polarized distribution in renal epithelial cells.\r"

Electrophysiological recording in cortical areas 3b and 1 in three adult squirrel monkeys no less than 2 months after nerve transection has revealed that cutaneous responsiveness is regained throughout the deprived cortex and that a roughly normal topographic order is reestablished for the reorganized cortex.\r"

  ".W": "The specific reaction between SH and iodoacetamide groups has been explored as the basis of an affinity-type purification procedure for peptides synthesized by the solid-phase technique. For this affinity-type purification procedure, we synthesized an SH precursor reagent bearing an acid-labile S-protecting group, pMB-SCH2CONHCH2CH2-SO2CH2CH2OCO2pNP (compound I), in which pMB is p-methoxybenzyl and pNP is p-nitrophenyl. Using this reagent, the procedure involves the following sequence of four reactions: (i) attachment of the SH function of compound I to the alpha-amino group of a peptide-resin through a base-labile sulfonylethoxycarbonyl linkage in the final step of solid-phase peptide synthesis, (ii) acid treatment to remove the S-pMB and side-chain-protecting groups employed and cleave the modified peptide from the resin, (iii) immobilization of the derived SH-peptide on an iodoacetamide-resin column, and (iv) base (5% NH4OH) treatment to release the desired peptide from the resin in nearly pure form. To facilitate this purification procedure, unreacted amino groups were acetylated in each step during solid-phase synthesis. The usefulness of this method was demonstrated by the purification of several peptides (18 to approximately 44 amino acids in length) synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid-phase technique. The principle of this affinity-type purification procedure may also be applied to the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-based solid-phase technique.\r"

The 369-nucleotide mature form of the RNA has an apparent precursor with an 84-nucleotide 5' leader and approximately 33 nucleotides of additional 3' sequence. Analysis of RPR1 transcription in a strain with a temperature-sensitive lesion in RNA polymerase III shows that the gene is transcribed in vivo by RNA polymerase III. Examination of potential promoter regions using both progressive upstream deletions and point mutations indicates that at least two sequences contained within the 5' leader region are essential for expression in vivo, while sequences farther upstream influence efficiency. The required leader elements resemble tRNA gene-like A-box and B-box internal promoters in sequence and spacing. As in the tRNA genes, transcription factor TFIIIC binds to this region in vitro and binding is severely reduced by either A-box or B-box point mutations that impair expression in vivo. It thus appears that the yeast RNase P RNA gene has adopted a promoter strategy that places an RNA polymerase III \"internal\" promoter upstream of the mature structural domain to help drive transcription.\r"

Here we present structural and functional evidence that human SF and human HGF (and also the human lung fibroblast-derived mitogen) are identical proteins encoded by a single gene, since (i) no major difference could be found by protein sequencing, by cDNA analysis, and by immunological comparison and (ii) SF in fact acts as a hepatocyte growth factor--i.e., stimulates DNA synthesis of activity--i.e., dissociates and induces invasiveness of various epithelial cells. The human SF/HGF gene was localized to chromosome bands 7q11.2-21. These results have important consequences for further studies on the involvement of SF/HGF as a modulator of cellular growth and motility in embryonal, malignant, and regenerative processes.\r"

To test whether mammalian terminal repeats can function after reintroduction into a mammalian cell, a repeat-containing terminal fragment from a human chromosome was electroporated into a hamster-human hybrid cell line. In 6 of 27 independent transformants analyzed, the introduced sequences were found at the ends of chromosomes, based on all available criteria. Terminal restriction-fragment heterogeneity and the survival of these chromosomes demonstrate that these telomeres are functional. Cytogenetic evidence from one of these cell lines suggests that chromosome breakage with healing at the integration site is the mechanism responsible for the terminal location.\r"

  ".U": "91334397\r", 
  ".W": "A 17-kilobase (kb) region of the zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) genome has been sequenced and contains two genes, CP-ACC1A and CP-ACC1B, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACC synthase; S-adenosyl-L-methionine methylthioadenosine-lyase, EC 4.4.1.14). The genes are transcribed convergently and are separated by a 5.7-kb intergenic region. Their coding regions are interrupted by four introns located in identical positions. While the DNA identity in their coding regions is 97%, their 5' and 3' flanking regions are highly divergent. Transcription of CP-ACCIA is rapidly induced by wounding in fruit and etiolated hypocotyls and by indoleacetic acid (IAA)/benzyladenine/LiCl only in fruit tissue. Conditions that induce CP-ACC1B expression have not been found. Protein synthesis inhibition derepresses the expression of CP-ACC1A and other unidentified ACC synthase genes, suggesting that they may be under negative control. The amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the genes are 493 and 494 residues long with 95% identity. The most notable feature of the amino acid sequence is the presence of 11 of the 12 invariant amino acid residues involved in the binding of the substrate and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate in various aminotransferases. We conclude that ACC synthase is encoded by a multigene family of which certain members are differentially induced by auxin in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, ACC synthase, a pyridoxal-containing enzyme, may have an evolutionary relationship with the superfamily of aminotransferases.\r"

The method uses a system in which the 35S rRNA gene is fused to the GAL7 promoter and is transcribed by RNA polymerase II under control of the GAL regulatory system. Chromosomal mutations affecting components specifically involved in synthesis of 35S rRNA by RNA polymerase I can be suppressed by this hybrid gene in the presence of inducer (galactose) but not in its absence. We looked for mutants the growth of which depended on the presence of plasmid expressing the hybrid gene. For this purpose, we used a red/white-colony color assay as the initial screen followed by a test for galactose-dependent growth. We have thus isolated many mutants and identified at least nine genes (RRN1-RRN9) involved in 35S rRNA synthesis, two of which correspond to known RNA polymerase I subunit genes RPA190 and RPA135.\r"

Nicotiana tabacum was transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring a cointegrated plasmid pSN002::pGV2260. The presence of mRNA and of the translated protein from the chimeric cytochrome P-450 gene in transgenic plants was confirmed by RNA blot hybridization and by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, respectively. The transformants in which the foreign cytochrome P-450 protein is expressed show marked phenotypic changes, notably a tendency rapidly to senesce. We detected 2-propenylpyrrolidine, a degradative metabolite of nicotine alkaloids, in transgenic tobacco showing this pronounced phenotypic change. Such metabolism is likely to be due to the effect of senescence and not directly to the presence of the cytochrome P-450.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the influence of thermal fluctuations on DNA curvature the Metropolis procedure at 300 K was applied to B-DNA decamers containing A5.T5 and A4.T4 blocks. Monte Carlo simulations have confirmed the DNA bending anisotropy: B-DNA bends most easily in a groove direction (roll). The A5.T5 block is more rigid than the other sequences; the pyrimidine-purine dimers are found to be the most flexible. For A5TCTCT, A5CTCTC, and A5GAGAG, the average bend angle per decamer is 20-25 degrees in a direction toward the minor groove in the center of the A5.T5 tract, which is consistent with both the \"junction\" and \"wedge AA\" models. However, in A5T5, A4T4CG, and T4A4GC, bending is directed into the grooves at the 5' and 3' ends of purine tracts. Thus, directionality of bending caused by An.Tn blocks strongly depends on their neighboring sequences. These calculations demonstrate that the sequence-dependent variation of the minor-groove width mimics the observed hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern. To estimate the effect of fluctuations on the overall shape of curved DNA fragments, longer pieces of DNA (up to 200 base pairs) were generated. For sequences with strong curvature (A5X5 and A4T4CG), the static model and Monte Carlo ensemble give similar results but, for moderately and slightly curved sequences (A5T5 or T4A4GC), the static model predicts a much smaller degree of bending than does the statistical representation. Considering fluctuations is important for quantitative interpretation of the gel electrophoresis measurements of DNA curvature, where both the static and statistical bends are operative.\r"

Cells transformed by STP-C488 formed invasive tumors in nude mice. The STP-A11 reading frame of strain 11 (subgroup A) was much less potent in its transforming ability than STP-C488.

In contrast, infection by primary isolates of HIV-1 is much less sensitive to blocking in vitro by soluble CD4-based molecules. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference between HIV-1 strains, we isolated the gp120-encoding genes from several CD4-resistant and CD4-sensitive HIV-1 strains and characterized the CD4-binding properties of their recombinant gp120 (rgp120) products. Extensive amino acid sequence variation was found between the gp120 genes of CD4-resistant and CD4-sensitive HIV-1 isolates. However, the CD4-binding affinities of rgp120 from strains with markedly different CD4 sensitivities were essentially the same, and only small differences were observed in the kinetics of CD4 binding. These results suggest that the lower sensitivity of primary HIV-1 isolates to neutralization by CD4-based molecules is not due to lower binding affinity between soluble CD4 and free gp120.\r"

To test the function of variant U2 RNA structures from different organisms, we conducted phylogenetic exchanges of U2 domains. Replacing nucleotides 1-120 of yeast U2 with the corresponding region of human U2 generates a U2 RNA that is correctly folded and functions in yeast. In contrast, replacement of the branchpoint interaction region of yeast U2 with the corresponding region from trypanosome is dominant lethal. Using a GAL-U2 promoter fusion, we show that the dominant phenotype can be made conditional and that the accumulation of mutant U2 is followed rapidly by inhibition of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing. The results suggest that U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles normally participate in stable complexes with a limiting splicing factor prior to formation of U2-intron branchpoint base pairs.\r"

  ".W": "In the course of studies to map spatial frequency tuning of neurons in layers 2 and 3 of macaque striate cortex, we found that a high proportion (70%) of cells in the interblob regions responded poorly to full-field gratings, compared with responses to single bars, edges, or delimited gratings. This was most often due to side inhibition, in which increasing the number of cycles of a grating placed within the cell's receptive field causes progressive inhibition of response. Quantitative receptive-field mappings showed, however, that the inhibition can occur within the region activated by a bar, as well as beyond it. The inhibition appears to be orientation-selective, in that a surround grating was more effective at inhibiting the response to a center grating patch if it was of similar orientation. 2-Deoxyglucose experiments confirmed that side inhibition is very widespread in the interblobs of layers 2 and 3 and suggested that it is reduced or lacking in layers 4A through 6. Since layers 2 and 3 of striate cortex are the major source of cortical projections to area V2 and beyond, the prevalence of side stopping in these laminae has implications for theories of cortical visual function. Side-stopped interblob cells may be acting as \"contour-pass filters\" that filter out redundant information in textured or noisy surfaces, focusing subsequent form processing on contrasts corresponding to object boundaries.\r"

In the current study, however, a transiently activated form of myoglobin was shown to be formed when the prosthetic heme group became covalently bound to the polypeptide during the reaction of myoglobin with low levels of HOOH. In the presence of an enzymatic metmyoglobin reducing system containing diaphorase and methylene blue with excess NADH, this HOOH-altered myoglobin catalyzed NADH oxidation and oxygen consumption; the overall stoichiometry indicated a two-electron reduction of oxygen to HOOH. This reaction was not catalyzed by iron released from heme, as desferrioxamine had no effect on the activity. Stoichiometric amounts of HOOH were sufficient to produce the activated oxidase state of myoglobin, whereas larger amounts of HOOH lead to heme destruction, iron release, and inactivation of the oxidase activity. The alteration of myoglobin to an enzyme that can form toxic oxygen metabolites may have pathological importance, especially in myocardial injury caused by ischemia and reperfusion, where myoglobin is present in large amounts and HOOH is formed. Furthermore, the oxidase form may be involved in the mechanism of destruction of the heme seen with oxidative treatment of myoglobin.\r"

Deletion of the DNA-binding domain or of the second Zn finger or a point mutation in the Zn catenation site in the second finger blocked the ability of GR to mediate repression of the IL-6 promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of the first Zn finger, a point mutation in the Zn-catenation site in the first finger, or one in the steroid-specificity domain at the base of the first finger converted GR into a dexamethasone-responsive activator that enhanced basal and interleukin 1-induced IL-6 promoter function. These first-finger mutants of GR also mediated dexamethasone-responsive enhancement of expression of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TK-105-CAT and TK-80-CAT) reporter genes but not of the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-CAT or the c-fos-CAT (pFC700) reporter genes. Wild-type GR was able to specifically bind to DNA fragments containing glucocorticoid response element sequences in both the murine mammary tumor virus and IL-6 promoters, albeit weakly to the latter, in a sequential DNA-binding immunoprecipitation assay. The first-finger mutants of GR, however, were inactive in this assay. Thus, mutations in the first Zn finger unmask unusual promoter-specific activation properties of GR that may not require direct high-affinity binding of the mutant GR to target DNA.\r"

  ".U": "91334411\r", 
  ".W": "Studies with purified nitric oxide synthase from rat cerebellum have confirmed previous reports that product formation is enhanced by tetrahydrobiopterin [H4B; 6-(L-erythro-1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin]. The effect of the natural isomer, (6R)-H4B, is observed at extremely low (less than 0.1 microM) concentrations and is remarkably selective. At these concentrations, only the diastereoisomer (6S)-H4B, the structural isomer 7-(L-erythro-1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin, and 7,8-dihydrobiopterin showed detectable effects. Our observations are inconsistent with a stoichiometric role for H4B in the oxygenation of arginine [e.g., Stuehr, D. J., Kwon, N. S., Nathan, C. F., Griffith, O. W., Feldman, P. L. & Wiseman, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6259-6263]. Activity is initially independent of added H4B; enhanced product formation with H4B is observed only as incubation progresses. The effect of H4B is catalytic, with each mole of added H4B supporting the formation of greater than 15 mol of product. Recycling of H4B was excluded by direct measurement during nitric oxide synthesis and by the demonstration that nitric oxide synthase is not inhibited by methotrexate. These combined results exclude H4B as a stoichiometric reactant and suggest that H4B enhances product formation by protecting enzyme activity against progressive loss. Preliminary studies indicate that the decreased activity in the absence of added H4B does not depend on catalytic turnover of the enzyme. The role of H4B may be allosteric or it may function to maintain some group(s) on the enzyme in a reduced state required for activity.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the role of titin filaments in muscle elasticity, we measured the resting tension-sarcomere length curves of six rabbit skeletal muscles that express three size classes of titin isoform. The stress-strain curves of the split fibers of these muscles displayed a similar multiphasic shape, with an exponential increase in tension at low sarcomere strain followed by a leveling of tension and a decrease in stiffness at and beyond an elastic limit (yield point) at higher sarcomere strain. Significantly, positive correlations exist between the size of the expressed titin isoform, the sarcomere length at the onset of exponential resting tension, and the yield point of each muscle. Immunoelectron microscopic studies of an epitope in the extensible segment of titin revealed a transition in the elastic behavior of the titin filaments near the yield point sarcomere length of these muscles, providing direct evidence of titin's involvement in the genesis of resting tension. Our data led to the formulation of a segmental extension model of resting tension that recognizes the interplay of three major factors in shaping the stress-strain curves: the net contour length of an extensible segment of titin filaments (between the Z line and the ends of the thick filaments), the intrinsic molecular elasticity of titin, and the strength of titin thick filament anchorage. Our data further suggest that skeletal muscle cells may control and modulate stiffness and elastic limit coordinately by selective expression of specific titin isoforms.\r"

In contrast to transfection of wild-type low-affinity p75 NGF receptors, transfection of p75NGFR with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in an inability of NGF to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, indicating that p75NGFR is involved in initiating phosphorylation events by NGF. Even though the p75NGFR receptor does not possess any inherent tyrosine kinase activity, these experiments demonstrate that the p75NGFR has a potential role in NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation.\r"

Receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma generates diacylglycerol, the major cellular activator of PKC. Immunofluorescence techniques were used to investigate the subcellular localization of two PLC isozymes (PLC-gamma and PLC-delta) in normal and simian virus 40-transformed REF52 cells to determine (i) if PLC colocalizes with alpha-PKC and (ii) if PLC isozyme distribution is sensitive to transformation. PLC-delta was not detected in either cell type. In REF52 cells, PLC-gamma was associated with the actin cytoskeleton and was evenly distributed along the length of the actin microfilaments. PLC-gamma was coincident with alpha-PKC at the points where the filaments are anchored to the membrane (i.e., the focal contacts). Cytoskeletal association of PLC-gamma was not transformation sensitive, although the actin cytoskeleton was more disordered in simian virus 40-transformed cells. In REF52 cells, platelet-derived growth factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both soluble and cytoskeletal PLC-gamma. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma did not seem to be a determinant of its subcellular localization, but there was a detectable increase in cytoskeleton-associated PLC-gamma in response to platelet-derived growth factor treatment.\r"

The peptides, produced as beta-galactosidase fusion proteins, induced virus-neutralizing and peptide-specific antibodies. After challenge with virulent virus, controls became virus positive and developed gradually rising antibody titers to SIV over 63 weeks. Immunized macaques developed a postchallenge anamnestic response to SIVenv antigens within 3-6 weeks followed by a gradual, fluctuating decline in SIV antibody titers and partial or total suppression of detectable SIV. Virus suppression correlated with prechallenge neutralizing antibody titers. Although the average CD4+ cell count in the blood of immunized macaques remained constant, the control macaques exhibited a progressive decrease developing about week 55 after challenge. The conserved nature of the HIV and SIV peptides and the similar humoral immunoreactivity in the respective hosts suggest that homologous HIV peptides may be important components of a successful immunization strategy.\r"

Binding activity was also removed by absorbing gp120 with liposomes containing GalCer. In addition, studies using natural and semisynthetic lipids indicate that the linkage between galactose and ceramide is essential for binding.

Measurements of intracellular Ca concentration [( Ca]i) using the fluorescent Ca indicator fura-2 showed that GABA potently inhibited Ca influx into the terminal elicited by high extracellular K concentration ([K]o). This inhibition was attributed to GABA type A (GABAA) receptor-activated chloride ion conductance that prevented bipolar neurons from depolarizing sufficiently to activate the Ca current, even in response to increased [K]o. Patch-clamp recordings of the Ca current revealed a second effect of GABA: GTP-dependent inhibition of the Ca current. This inhibition was not mediated by GABAA receptors, but baclofen, which binds to the GABA type B (GABAB) receptor and is known to inhibit the Ca current in other systems, was not able to mimic the action of GABA. This suggests the involvement of a different type of GABAB-like receptor in the inhibition of Ca current by GABA. GABA did not cause an overall suppression of the Ca current; rather, the voltage-dependence of Ca-channel activation was shifted to more depolarized potentials. Thus, maximal inhibition of the Ca current by GABA occurred in the physiological range of potential.\r"

  ".W": "In human cells infected with adenovirus, the virus-associated RNA VAI blocks the activation of the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent 68-kDa protein kinase (p68) and maintains normal levels of protein synthesis at late times after infection. VAI antagonizes the kinase activity by binding to p68. The structure of VAI consists of two long, base-paired stems connected by a complex short stem-loop structure. Previous work using a series of adenovirus mutants showed that the structural determinants of the VAI RNA that are essential for function reside in the central complex short stem-loop structure and adjacent base-paired regions (functional domain); the long duplex regions were found to be dispensable for function. To determine whether binding of VAI to p68 correlates with function and whether the structural determinants that are essential for function are also essential for binding, we studied the interaction of wild-type and several mutant VAI RNAs with p68 in whole cells. The p68-VAI complexes from mutant- and wild-type-infected cells were immunoprecipitated by an anti-p68 monoclonal antibody. The mutant RNAs that functioned efficiently in the cells bound to p68 efficiently in the cells, whereas functionally impaired mutants failed to bind to p68, indicating that the binding of the VAI RNA to p68 correlates well with function. In vitro binding assays with immunopurified p68 confirmed these observations. Secondary-structure analysis of several mutant VAI RNAs suggests that the binding does not depend on the long duplex regions but requires all the elements of the functional domain. We propose that the functional domain and the p68-binding domain of the VAI RNA are identical.\r"

Rex also bound in vitro to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev-responsive element (RRE), while purified HIV-1 Rev protein did not bind to the RXRE. The binding results obtained in vitro are therefore in agreement with the nonreciprocal function of Rev and Rex in vivo. Rex binds specifically to both RRE and RXRE and activates expression in both HIV-1 and HTLV-I, while Rev binds to RRE and activates only HIV-1. Binding of Rex to RRE deletion mutants previously shown to lack either the Rev-responsive or the Rex-responsive portion suggested preferential binding of Rex to a distinct target within the RRE. These results demonstrated that Rex, like Rev, acts by binding to a specific RNA target.\r"

This method uses two independent selectable markers in successive rounds of gene targeting to replace both alleles of an endogenous gene. We developed an improved hygromycin B-resistance cassette encoding hygromycin phosphotransferase (HYG) for use as a selectable marker for Leishmania. HYG-containing vectors functioned equivalently to those containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (NEO) cassette previously used for extrachromosomal transformation or gene targeting. Drug resistances conferred by the NEO and HYG markers were independent, allowing simultaneous selection for both markers. A HYG targeting vector was utilized to replace the single dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) gene remaining in a line heterozygous for a NEO replacement at the dhfr-ts locus (+/neo), with a targeting efficiency comparable to that seen with wild-type recipients. The resultant dhfr-ts- line (hyg/neo) was auxotrophic for thymidine. The double targeted replacement method will enable functional genetic testing in a variety of asexual diploids, including cultured mammalian cells and fungi such as Candida albicans. Additionally, it may be possible to use Leishmania bearing conditionally auxotrophic gene replacements as safe, improved live vaccines for leishmaniasis.\r"

In contrast, in the presence of saturating concentrations of granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), TGF-beta promoted a 3- to 5-fold increase in the number and size (greater than 0.5 mm) of bone marrow colonies in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 10-20 pM; TGF-beta 1 alone had no effect. Morphological examination showed an increase in granulocyte colonies. In suspension cultures, TGF-beta 1 and GM-CSF stimulated an increase in total viable cells with markedly enhanced neutrophilic differentiation and a concomitant decrease in the number of monocytes/macrophages by day 6 in culture. Limiting dilution analysis demonstrated a 2- to 5-fold increase in the frequency of progenitor cells that responded to GM-CSF plus TGF-beta 1 vs. GM-CSF alone. Bone marrow progenitors obtained from mice 3 days after treatment with 5-fluorouracil responded to a combination of GM-CSF and TGF-beta 1, whereas either factor alone had no effect. A single-cell assay identified a progenitor cell that directly responded to TGF-beta and GM-CSF. TGF-beta increased the number of GM-CSF receptors on bone marrow cells. Thus, TGF-beta 1 can act as a bifunctional mediator of hematopoietic cell growth, and TGF-beta 1 and GM-CSF act together to stimulate granulopoiesis as measured by large granulocyte colony formation; the progenitor cell is tentatively designated granulocyte burst-forming unit.\r"

This cDNA encodes a glycoprotein that shares striking amino acid similarity with a purified myelin protein and is specifically precipitated by a myelin-specific antiserum. Immunohistochemistry experiments using peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies localize the SR13 protein to the myelin sheath of the sciatic nerve. Computer-aided sequence analysis identified a pronounced homology of SR13 to a growth arrest-specific mRNA (Gas-3) that is expressed in resting but not in proliferating 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. SR13 is similarly downregulated during Schwann cell proliferation in the rat sciatic nerve. The association of the SR13 as well as the Gas-3 mRNA with nonproliferating cells in two different experimental systems suggests a common role for these molecules in maintaining the quiescent cell state.\r"

One mechanism for promoting cell-cell adhesion involves the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of the target cell. Herpes simplex virus infection of endothelium induces arterial injury and has been implicated in the development of human atherosclerosis. We now demonstrate that HSV-infected endothelial cells express the adhesion molecule GMP140 and that this requires cell surface expression of HSV glycoprotein C and local thrombin generation. Monocyte adhesion to HSV-infected endothelial cells was completely inhibited by anti-GMP140 antibodies but not by antibodies to other adhesion molecules such as VCAM and ELAM-1. The induction of GMP140 expression on HSV-infected endothelium may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in virus-induced cell injury and inflammation.\r"

This and other features, attributable to its autonomous replication, make TMV an attractive candidate for expression of foreign sequences in plants. However, previous attempts to construct expression vectors based on plant RNA viruses, such as TMV, have been unsuccessful in obtaining systemic and stable movement of foreign genes to uninoculated leaves in whole plants. A hybrid viral RNA (TB2) was constructed, containing sequences from two tobamoviruses (TMV-U1 and odontoglossum ringspot virus). Two bacterial sequences inserted independently into TB2 moved systemically in Nicotiana benthamiana, although they differed in their stability on serial passage. Systemic expression of the bacterial protein neomycin phosphotransferase was demonstrated. Hybrid RNAs containing both TMV-U1 and the inserted bacterial gene sequences were encapsidated by the odontoglossum ringspot virus coat protein, facilitating their transmission and amplification on passaging to subsequent plants. The vector TB2 provides a rapid means of expressing genes and gene variants in plants.\r"

Following isolation of cyclodiene-resistant Drosophila mutants, we report the cloning of the locus conferring resistance via a \"chromosomal walk\" and rescue of the susceptible phenotype by P-element-mediated germ-line transformation. Amino acid sequence analysis of a cDNA from the locus reveals homology with vertebrate GABAA subunits. To our knowledge, this represents the first cloning of an invertebrate GABA receptor and also allows us to manipulate the resistance status of an insect via germ-line transformation. This gene may be useful as a selectable marker in other insect systems.\r"

We have previously used the synthetic peptide approach to establish one side of the hypothetical class II foreign-antigen binding cleft, alpha-helical region 65-85 of the beta chain, as a binding site involved in accessory cell presentation of SEA to T cells. To further characterize the structural basis for MHC-SEA interaction we have examined the role of the alpha-helical regions of the class II alpha and beta chains in SEA function. Using the synthetic peptide approach, we have found that both alpha-helical regions are required for SEA-induced proliferation. Their corresponding peptides directly bound SEA. Although the beta-chain peptides were able to inhibit SEA binding to human and mouse cells, the alpha-chain peptides were not. The data suggest that the alpha-helices along both sides of the hypothetical class II MHC molecule binding cleft are required for SEA-induced function, whereas the beta-chain alpha-helix is sufficient for SEA binding. A model of superantigen presentation is proposed wherein the MHC beta chain, possibly region 70-80, interacts with SEA region 1-45, whereas another region of SEA binds region 51-80 of the alpha chain.\r"

This proteolytic event precedes overt signs of neuronal degeneration, is most pronounced in regions of selective neuronal vulnerability, and could have significant consequences for the integrity of cellular function. The present studies demonstrate that (i) the early phase of enhanced proteolysis is a direct response to hypoxia rather than other actions of ischemia, (ii) it is possible to pharmacologically inhibit the in vivo proteolytic response to ischemia, (iii) inhibition of proteolysis is associated with a marked reduction in the extent of neuronal death, and (iv) protected neurons exhibit normal-appearing electrophysiological responses and retain their capacity for expressing long-term potentiation, a form of physiological plasticity thought to be involved in memory function. These observations indicate that calcium-activated proteolysis is an important component of the post-ischemic neurodegenerative response and that targeting this response may be a viable therapeutic strategy for preserving both the structure and function of vulnerable neurons.\r"

  ".U": "91334441\r", 
  ".W": "Since high-affinity adenosine A2 receptors (A2a) are localized exclusively in dopamine-rich regions in the central nervous system and mediate inhibition of locomotor activity, we have examined the effect of A2a receptor activation on D1 and D2 receptor binding in membrane preparations of the rat striatum. The A2a agonist 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino]-5'- N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680) increased the Kd of the dopamine D2 agonist L-(-)-N-[3H]propylnorapomorphine without affecting the Bmax. The increase in Kd was maximal (40%) at 30 nM CGS 21680. CGS 21680 (30 nM) decreased the dopamine-induced inhibition of [3H]raclopride (a D2 antagonist) binding due to an increase (about 3-fold) in KH and KL, the dissociation constants of high- and low-affinity binding sites. The effects of CGS 21680 were antagonized by the adenosine antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (10 microM). (-)-N6-(2-Phenylisopropyl)adenosine produced an effect similar to that of CGS 21680, provided the concentration used was high enough to stimulate A2a receptors (300 nM). GTP (50 microM) also decreased the dopamine-induced inhibition of [3H]raclopride binding but, in contrast to CGS 21680, GTP decreased the proportion of D2 receptors in the high-affinity state. CGS 21680 (30 nM) did not affect the Kd or Bmax of [3H]raclopride and failed to affect ligand binding to D1 receptors. Thus, stimulation of A2a receptors potently reduces the affinity of D2 agonist binding sites within the plasma membrane of striatal neurons. This A2a-D2 interaction may underlie the neuroleptic-like actions of adenosine agonists and the enhancing effects of adenosine antagonists, such as caffeine, on locomotor activity.\r"

Chronic induction of the Alz-50 antigen appeared in neurons around focal cortical deposits of beta amyloid. Immunoblot analysis showed that beta amyloid induced Alz-50-immunoreactive proteins in rat cerebral cortex that were very similar to the proteins induced in human cerebral cortex from patients with AD. The neuropeptide substance P prevented beta-amyloid-induced neuronal loss and expression of Alz-50 proteins when coadministered into the cerebral cortex. Systemic administration of substance P also provided protection against the effects of intracerebral beta amyloid. Thus, beta amyloid is a potent neurotoxin in the adult brain in vivo, and its effects can be blocked by substance P.\r"

Subjects had been reared for their first 6 months of life either without access to adults but with constant access to age mates (peer reared), a condition producing reduced exploration and increased fear-related behaviors, or as controls with their mothers; thereafter, all subjects received identical treatment. During home-cage periods, for 1 hr each day, 4 days a week, when the ethanol solution and vehicle were freely available, peer-reared subjects consumed significantly more alcohol than mother-reared subjects. When stress was increased via social separation, mother-reared animals increased their alcohol consumption to a level nearly as high as that of peer-reared monkeys. Average individual differences in alcohol consumption were markedly stable over time. In addition, there were strong positive correlations between alcohol consumption and distress behaviors. Biological indices of increased stress, such as plasma cortisol and corticotropin, were higher in peer-reared subjects. Within the peer- and mother-reared groups, these indices were positively correlated with alcohol consumption. The results suggest that early rearing experiences that predispose monkeys to increased fear-related behaviors produce excessive alcohol consumption under normal living conditions. Furthermore, a major challenge such as social separation increases alcohol consumption to levels producing intoxication even in monkeys not particularly vulnerable to stress.\r"

By using the lactose permease of Escherichia coli, a well-characterized membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and the N and C termini on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, we have studied the insertion and stability of in-frame deletion mutants. So long as the first N-terminal and the last four C-terminal putative alpha-helical domains are retained, stable polypeptides are inserted into the membrane, even when an odd number of helical domains is deleted. Moreover, even when an odd number of helices is deleted, the C terminus remains on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, as judged by lacY-phoA fusion analysis. In addition, permease molecules devoid of even or odd numbers of putative transmembrane helices retain a specific pathway for downhill lactose translocation. The findings imply that relatively short C-terminal domains of the permease contain topological information sufficient for insertion in the native orientation regardless of the orientation of the N terminus.\r"

Gata3 was shown in the chicken to be an enhancer-binding protein containing a zinc-finger domain. We have isolated a full-length human Gata3 cDNA and characterized its role in TCR gene regulation. Northern blot analysis showed that the Gata3 mRNA is present in T-cell, but not B-cell, macrophage or HeLa cell lines. The in vitro transcribed and translated Gata3 cDNA product bound specifically to the enhancer elements of at least three TCR genes containing the above consensus sequence. This binding specificity was consistent with the in vivo activity of the TCR enhancer-binding element in transient transfection assays. Hence, the Gata3 protein, together with other T-cell-specific enhancer-binding proteins, may form the basis of tissue-specific expression of the TCR genes.\r"

Mutations at this residue drastically altered the overall degree of drug resistance conveyed by mdr1 and mdr3. The modulating effect of this mutation on mdr1 and mdr3 varied for the drugs tested: it was very strong for colchicine and adriamycin and moderate for vinblastine. For mdr1, the Ser941----Phe941 substitution produced a unique mutant protein that retained the capacity to confer vinblastine resistance but lost the ability to confer adriamycin and colchicine resistance.

The cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1392 bp that predicted a protein of 464 amino acids and a molecular mass of 52 kDa; this protein has 97% identity to rat liver glucokinase. Fourteen residues on the amino terminus of the predicted human liver glucokinase, however, differed completely from those of the predicted rat liver enzyme and could be explained by alternative splicing of a 124-bp cassette exon in human cDNA. A second glucokinase cDNA (hLGLK2), missing the 124-bp cassette exon, was isolated by PCR amplification of human liver cDNA. The hLGLK2 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1398 bp from an ATG codon at position 164, encoding a predicted protein of 466 residues, 98% identical to the rat enzyme, but different from the predicted protein of hLGLK1 cDNA by 16 amino-terminal residues. In contrast, hLGLK1 cDNA contains multiple initiator codons upstream of the predicted initiator codon at position 294 within the cassette exon. Translation of the two mRNAs in vitro by a reticulocyte lysate system resulted in proteins of the expected size (52 kDa) for both mRNAs; yet hLGLK2 mRNA was translated four to six times more efficiently. These results suggested that the alternative splicing of a cassette exon in hLGLK1 resulted in an mRNA with an upstream initiator codon and reduced function. The relative biological activity of the two isoforms of human glucokinase and their possible developmental and/or metabolic regulation remain to be determined.\r"

It is shown here that TFIIIB can be chromatographically separated into two components, each of which is required for efficient tRNA gene transcription. DNA-protein photocrosslinking experiments show these two components separately contain the 90- and 70-kDa TFIIIB-specific polypeptides. The 70-kDa component forms a heparin-sensitive complex with transcription factor TFIIIC and DNA, stabilizes TFIIIC interaction with the tRNA gene promoter elements, and protects against DNase I digestion in the 3' portion of the upstream DNA sequence that is occupied by TFIIIB. The 90-kDa component of TFIIIB, which only detectably interacts with the TFIIIC-DNA complex when the 70-kDa component is also present, generates the complete DNase I protection pattern of TFIIIB and bestows heparin-insensitivity on the TFIIIB-DNA complex. The resolution of TFIIIB into two functional components further defines the probable steps and interactions involved in the formation of stable transcription complexes.\r"

  ".W": "The N-terminal 17% of human apolipoprotein B (apoB-17) was expressed in murine C127 cells following transfection with a bovine papilloma virus-based expression vector. A permanent cell line overexpressing the expected 89-kDa protein was selected and characterized. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the depletion of intracellular apoB-17 follows an apparent first-order kinetics with t1/2 = 51 min. Under conditions of continuous labeling, greater than 60% of the total synthesized apoB-17 was secreted in a soluble form, approximately 98% lipid-poor and approximately 2% lipid-bound. Inclusion of 1.2 mM oleate resulted in 5- and 2.5-fold increases in the amount of labeled apoB-17 in the p less than 1.063 g/ml and 1.063 less than p less than 1.21 g/ml fractions, respectively, which was coordinated with increased secretion of radiolabeled core lipids, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters. Thus under conditions in which lipid pools are enriched a greater fraction of apoB-17 may be secreted on lipoprotein-like particles. The lipid-poor apoB-17 present in p greater than 1.21 g/ml readily associates with exogenously added dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) multilamellar vesicles to form discoidal particles. Discs formed with DMPC/apoB-17, 7:1 (wt/wt), are 239 +/- 43 A in diameter and 61 +/- 4 A thick and contain approximately 2 molecules of apoB-17 and 2250 molecules of DMPC per disc. Based on volume calculations we conclude that apoB-17 forms an annulus about one bilayer high and 10 A thick surrounding the DMPC disc. Circular dichroic spectra of apoB-17 on DMPC discs showed apoB-17 to contain 39% alpha-helix, 36% beta-sheet, 9% beta-turn, and 16% random coil. To be consistent with this model greater than 70% of apoB-17 on DMPC discs must bind to lipid. These data suggest that the N-terminal 17% of apoB-100 can bind lipid and may contribute to some extent to the stabilization of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.\r"

We report here the characterization of tension transients induced by a rapid (less than 1-ms) release of increased pressure at 12 degrees C. The tension transient consists of three clear phases, an initial further decrease of tension in phase with pressure change followed by two phases of tension increase back to the level recorded at ambient pressure. The mean reciprocal relaxation time for phase 2 (1/tau 2) was approximately 17 s-1 and that for phase 3 (1/tau 3) was 3 s-1. The presence of 20 mM inorganic phosphate markedly increased 1/tau 2 to approximately 52 s-1 and decreased 1/tau 3 to approximately 1.7 s-1. These observations are interpreted in terms of a pressure-sensitive transition between two attached crossbridge states of low (or zero) and higher force. This is compatible with the pressure-sensitive isomerization of actomyosin previously observed in solution. The results presented allow us to propose a coupling between a specific pressure-sensitive isomerization of purified actomyosin, the phosphate release step of the ATPase pathway, and the force-generating event of the cross-bridge cycle.\r"

In this report we have tested the affinity of simian virus 40 toward the nucleus by microinjecting virion particles into the cytoplasm under conditions in which cell-surface-mediated viral infection was blocked. Subcellular localization of viral structural proteins Vp1, Vp2, and Vp3, large tumor antigen, and virion particles was followed immunocytochemically and ultrastructurally. Both virion particles and viral structural proteins localized in the nucleus within 1-2 hr after cytoplasmic injection and subsequently expressed large tumor antigen, which was detected in the nucleus as early as 3 hr after cytoplasmic injection. Vp1 and large tumor antigen nuclear accumulation, as well as virion nuclear entry, were blocked by wheat germ agglutinin and an anti-nucleoporin monoclonal antibody, mAb 414. Virion particles were visualized in the vicinity of nuclear pores and in the cytoplasm with this agent. We conclude that virion particles are karyophilic and enter through nuclear pores. This study suggests that virion structural proteins facilitate virion import into the nucleus and viral gene expression.\r"

To identify potential pattern-control genes in planarian regeneration, we have isolated two homeobox-containing genes, Dth-1 and Dth-2 [Dugesia (Girardia) tigrina homeobox], by using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the most conserved amino acid sequence from helix-3 of the homeodomain. Dth-1 and Dth-2 homeodomains are closely related (68% at the nucleotide level and 78% at the protein level) and show the conserved residues characteristic of the homeodomains identified to data. Similarity with most homeobox sequences is low (30-50%), except with Drosophila NK homeodomains (80-82% with NK-2) and the rodent TTF-1 homeodomain (77-87%). Some unusual amino acid residues specific to NK-2, TTF-1, Dth-1, and Dth-2 can be observed in the recognition helix (helix-3) and may define a family of homeodomains. The deduced amino acid sequences from the cDNAs contain, in addition to the homeodomain, other domains also present in various homeobox-containing genes. The expression of both genes, detected by Northern blot analysis, appear slightly higher in cephalic regions than in the rest of the intact organism, while a slight increase is detected in the central period (5 days) or regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "Helper T lymphocytes recognize fragments of foreign (or self) antigens in the peptide-binding clefts of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules; their activation is a crucial step in the induction of many immune and autoimmune responses. While studying the latter, we raised a T-cell line from the thymus of a myasthenia gravis patient against recombinant alpha subunit of the human acetylcholine receptor, the target of this autoimmune disease. The line responds to the 144-156 region of the human sequence and not to the same region of the electric fish homolog, which differs by only three residues. These CD4+ T cells recognize this epitope only in the context of HLA-DR4 class II molecules, of which the variants with Gly86 are absolutely required. Thus the naturally occurring alternatives Dw14.2 (Gly86) and Dw14.1 (Val86)--which differ only at this one position in the entire antigen-binding region--show an all-or-nothing difference in presenting activity. This dimorphism at position 86 is widespread, occurring in subtypes of DR1, DR2, DR3, DR5, and DR6 alleles as well as DR4. Since other DR4 subtypes with substitutions at positions 70-74 also fail to present this peptide, and glycine residues can be uniquely flexible, we suggest that this replacement at position 86 acts locally or at a distance by altering the conformation of the peptide-binding cleft. Such profound functional consequences for T-cell recognition as we report here may explain this example of conserved major histocompatibility complex diversity.\r"

To elucidate the implication of GGT in various metabolic pathways, we established a stable transgenic V79 cell line, highly producing the human GGT. A full-length cDNA, encoding the human hepatoma HepG2 GGT, was subcloned in an expression vector under the control of the simian virus 40 early promoter and was used to transfect V79 cells. We selected a cell line exhibiting a GGT activity of 2 units per mg of protein, the highest GGT expression level reported to date. As described for the human kidney and liver enzymes, the recombinant GGT purified from this cell line showed a heterodimeric structure. Its two subunits existed as sialylated and differentially glycosylated isoforms, with mean molecular masses of 80 and 29 kDa. However, catalytic features were found to be identical to those of human serum and HepG2 GGTs.

High-affinity rev binding is maintained when the bubble is placed in heterologous stem-loop structures, but rev binding is reduced when either the bulged residues or flanking base pairs in the stem are altered. Rev binding to the purine-rich bubble nucleates assembly of long filamentous ribonucleoprotein structures containing polymers of rev bound to flanking RNA sequences.

  ".U": "91334467\r", 
  ".W": "In serine proteases, residue 192, three residues prior to the active site Ser-195, plays an important role in determining substrate specificity. In trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) and most trypsin-like enzymes with relatively broad specificity, this position is occupied by Gln. In thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5), an enzyme with restricted specificity, position 192 is occupied by Glu. The potential importance of Glu-192 in restricting the specificity of thrombin was investigated by isosterically replacing Glu-192 with Gln. Unlike trypsin, thrombin cleavage of peptides with acidic residues in positions P3 and P'3 [where P3 and P'3 refer to three residues removed from the Arg (P1) cleavage site on the amino and carboxyl side, respectively] is inefficient. Protein C, an anticoagulant zymogen, has Asp residues in positions P3 and P'3. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial cell protein, complexes with thrombin to activate protein C rapidly thus altering the specificity of thrombin. Compared to thrombin, the Glu-192----Gln mutant thrombin activates protein C 22 times more rapidly and cleaves the P7-P'5 peptide from the protein C activation site 19 times faster. Enhanced protein C activation results primarily from an increase in the catalytic rate constant rather than an improved Michaelis constant, a property that is shared by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. The Glu-192----Gln mutation does not influence fibrinopeptide A release and only increases the rate of fibrinopeptide B release 2.7-fold. These results demonstrate that Glu-192 plays a critical role in restricting the specificity of thrombin and suggest that thrombomodulin may function in part by altering the enzyme-substrate interaction near residue 192 in thrombin.\r"

We isolated a gene encoding a yeast PP2B homolog (CNA1) by screening a yeast genomic DNA library in the expression vector lambda gt11, first with 125I-labeled yeast calmodulin and then with a human cDNA encoding the catalytic (or A) subunit of calcineurin. The predicted CNA1 gene product is 54% identical to its mammalian counterpart. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers based on sequences conserved between CNA1 and mammalian PP2B genes, we isolated a second gene, CNA2. CNA2 is identical to PP2Bw, a partial cDNA clone previously described by others as originating from rabbit brain tissue. Our findings demonstrate that a unicellular eukaryote contains phosphoprotein phosphatases of the 2B class. Haploid cells containing a single cna1 or cna2 null mutation, or both mutations, were viable. MATa cna1 cna2 double mutants were more sensitive than wild-type cells or either single mutant to growth arrest induced by the mating pheromone alpha factor and failed to resume growth during continuous exposure to alpha factor. Thus, calcineurin action antagonizes the mating-pheromone response pathway.\r"

Colocalization with catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was used to demonstrate the peroxisomal localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. In the fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome patients, the enzyme is not transported to the peroxisomal ghosts but, like catalase, remains in the cytoplasm.

  ".W": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) in mammalian cells is associated with the expression of the MDR1 gene encoding P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an and active efflux pump for various lipophilic compounds. MDR transfectants can be isolated after MDR1 gene transfer and selection with cytotoxic drugs; low levels of drug resistance have also been observed in unselected NIH 3T3 mouse cells after retrovirus-mediated transfer of mouse mdr1 cDNA. MDR cell lines possess multiple phenotypic changes, suggesting that P-gp function could be complemented by some additional mechanisms associated with cytotoxic selection. To determine whether cytotoxic selection contributes to the MDR phenotype of MDR1-expressing cells, NIH 3T3 cells infected with a recombinant retrovirus carrying the human MDR1 gene were selected by two different procedures: (i) noncytotoxic selection for increased P-gp expression on the cell surface by multiple rounds of immunofluorescence labeling and flow sorting or (ii) one or more steps of selection with a cytotoxic drug. The levels of MDR in both types of infectants showed an excellent correlation with the P-gp density in the plasma membrane, expressed as immunoreactivity with a P-gp-specific antibody normalized by reactivity with an antibody against an unrelated antigen. Cytotoxic selection conferred no additional increase in resistance relative to P-gp density. These results indicate that P-gp density in the plasma membrane may be sufficient to determine the level of MDR.\r"

Injected human beta-globin pre-mRNA became localized in 30-60 discrete nuclear sites that were coincident with loci defined by monoclonal antibodies against small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Sm) or another spliceosome component (SC-35) in parallel immunocytochemical studies on the same nuclei. Similar patterns of nuclear localization were observed with a rat proenkephalin pre-mRNA. Nuclear microinjection of an intronlacking beta-globin RNA, a splicing-defective beta-globin mutant pre-mRNA, or an antisense beta-globin pre-mRNA did not result in localization at discrete sites. These results indicate that pre-mRNA binds preferentially to nuclear Sm and SC-35 antibody-reactive sites in vivo and that the binding requires intron sequences.\r"

Our results show that addition of antibodies to IgD or to IgM can stimulate the PTK activity of the blk, fyn, and lyn gene products. Additionally, all three PTKs were found to coimmunoprecipitate with sIg in digitonin lysates from resting B cells. In all stimulatory conditions, whether initiated through sIgD or sIgM, the blk gene product p56blk displayed the strongest activation index. The kinetics of activation of these kinases, particularly that of p56blk, paralleled the early appearance of newly tyrosine-phosphorylated B-cell proteins, suggesting that this group of kinases may account for some portion of the tyrosine kinase activity in sIg-activated B cells. These observations demonstrate a functional and possible physical association between the members of the src family of PTKs and the B-cell antigen receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Graves disease is a common form of human autoimmune thyroiditis. It shares many pathological features and HLA associations with other, less easily studied, organ-specific autoimmune conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hence it is also a useful model for understanding these other diseases. We have previously shown that thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease that have been recently activated in vivo specifically recognize autologous thyroid epithelial cells. However, the autoantigens involved were not defined. In this study, we have made use of antigen-independent T-cell cloning techniques to show that at least three different thyroid antigens, three different epitopes on a single antigen, and two HLA class II elements are involved in this recognition process in a single individual. This demonstrates that T cells that are present and activated at the site of a human autoimmune disease may show considerable heterogeneity in their recognition of autoantigen on the target tissue. This contrasts with the limited heterogeneity recently reported in some animal models and has potentially important implications for both our understanding of the autoimmune process in humans and the design of immunotherapies to reverse it.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant rat stem cell factor (SCF) was studied for its ability to stimulate the growth of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells and to generate colony-forming cells (CFC) from highly enriched populations of hematopoietic cells. In serum-deprived cultures, SCF alone stimulated few colonies but interacted with a number of other hematopoietic growth factors, particularly interleukin 3, to promote colony formation. The most marked effect was on the generation of mixed-cell colonies. Hematopoietic cells were sorted into wheat-germ agglutinin-negative, monocyte-depleted, rhodamine 123 (Rh123)-bright or Rh123-dull cells. Historically, Rh123-bright cells are capable of short-term (less than 1 mo) marrow engraftment, whereas among Rh123-dull cells are cells capable of long-term marrow engraftment. Enriched cells (2.5 x 10(3) were placed into serum-deprived liquid cultures with various hematopoietic growth factors. Initially, the Rh123-bright and Rh123-dull cells had few CFC but, in the presence of interleukin 3 and SCF, Rh123-bright cells gave rise to greater than 15,000 granulocyte/macrophage CFC, greater than 1500 erythroid burst-forming cells, and greater than 700 mixed-cell CFC by day 5. In contrast, Rh123-dull cells proliferated only in the presence of interleukin 3 and SCF, but total cell numbers rose to a peak of 18,000 by day 21, and one-third of the cells were CFC. Thus, SCF, in combination with other growth factors, can generate large numbers of CFC from pre-CFC and appears to act earlier than hematopoietic growth factors described to date.\r"

Eosinophils bound specifically to both recombinant soluble ELAM-1 and recombinant soluble VCAM-1. Eosinophil binding to recombinant soluble VCAM-1 and to transfected CHO cells expressing VCAM-1 was inhibited with anti-VCAM-1 (4B9) and anti-very late activation antigen 4 (anti-VLA-4; HP1/2 or HP2/1) monoclonal antibodies. Eosinophils, but not neutrophils, expressed VLA-4 detected by cytofluorography. Eosinophil adherence to tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was partially blocked by monoclonal antibodies against ELAM-1 (BB11) and VCAM-1 (4B9) and against VLA-4 (HP2/1). Thus, while both eosinophils and neutrophils can bind to activated endothelial cells by adherence to ICAM-1 and ELAM-1, only eosinophils expressed VLA-4 and adhered to VCAM-1 on activated endothelial cells. Eosinophil adherence to VCAM-1 might provide a mechanism contributing to the selective recruitment of eosinophils into tissue sites of inflammation.\r"

Recently, a putative cDNA clone for tomato EFE (pTOM13) has been identified by inhibiting ethylene synthesis with an antisense gene expressed in transgenic plants. A direct test of its function has been made by expression of a pTOM13 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After cloning artefacts were discovered in the 5' region of the cDNA, a corrected cDNA (pRC13) was created by the fusion of the 5' end of a genomic clone to the 3' end of the cDNA and expressed in S. cerevisiae. Cultures of transformed yeast converted 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to ethylene, whereas control cells did not. This EFE activity displays similar characteristics to EFE found in plant tissue: it converts the trans isomer of the ACC analogue 1-amino-2-ethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid to 1-butene in preference to the cis isomer, and it is strongly inhibited by cobaltous ions and 1,10-phenanthroline. Furthermore, information gained from the activity of effectors on yeast EFE activity supports the hypothesis that EFE is one of a group of hydroxylase enzymes.\r"

Most cells from normal CNS, in contrast, lay within this latter, CD45low population. From previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated CD45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. Using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating CD45, CD4, and MHC class I molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of MHC class II molecules. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed CNS provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. In normal CNS, a very small population of blood-derived CD45high-expressing cells are present; most MHC class II expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia.\r"

Et-1 produced concentration-dependent pulmonary vasoconstriction at concentrations of 1 x 10(-10) M and higher. [Dpr1, Asp15]Et-1 (where Dpr is diaminopropionic acid), in which the outer disulfide was replaced by an amide bond and the inner disulfide was left intact, showed no agonist activity at 1 x 10(-6) M but 1 x 10(-7) M [Dpr1, Asp15]Et-1 inhibited Et-1-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction: effects of 1 x 10(-10) M 2 x 10(-10) M, and 1 x 10(-9) M Et-1 were inhibited by 98%, 75%, and 65%, respectively. Furthermore, this analog did not alter pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by thrombin, norepinephrine, or, most significantly, Et-3. A monocyclic Et-1 analog with the same sequence but in which the amide bond was not formed showed weak pulmonary vasoconstrictor activity (300-500 times less potent than Et-1) but had no antagonist activity. In addition, both the monocyclic control peptide and [Dpr1, Asp15]Et-1 competed effectively with 125I-labeled Et-1 for binding to cultured rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Thus, an Et-1 structural analog produced by replacement of the outer disulfide bond with an amide linkage displayed potent and specific Et-1 antagonism.\r"

We here bring genetical, biochemical, and cytological evidence that among the mitotic zygotes, a large proportion of them undergo cytokinesis without fusion of the nuclei-a process that has been termed \"cytoduction.\" By using appropriate genetic markers, haploid cytoductants that possess the nuclear genotype of one parent and the chloroplast marker of the other parent can easily be isolated. Genetical analysis and hybridization experiments moreover show that many haploid cytoductants transmit the chloroplast DNA molecules of both parents and that, as in diploids, these DNA copies occasionally recombine. This process of cytoduction extends the life cycle of Chlamydomonas and provides new tools for its genetic analysis.\r"

We have studied the peptide/lipid interactions of the amino-terminal amphipathic domain of SP-B by comparing the secondary conformations and surface activities of a family of synthetic peptides based on the native human SP-B sequence, modified by site-specific amino acid substitutions. Circular dichroism measurements show an alpha-helical structure correlating with the ability of the peptides to interact with lipids and with the surface activity of peptide/lipid dispersions. Amino acid substitutions altering either the charge or the hydrophobicity of the residues lowered the helical content and reduced the association of the aminoterminal segment with lipid dispersions. Surface activity of peptide/lipid mixtures was maximally altered by reversal of charge in synthetic peptides. These observations indicate that electrostatic interactions and hydrophobicity are important factors in determining optimal structure and function of surfactant peptides in lipid dispersions.\r"

Regardless of procedure performed, breast tissue was identified histologically in 5 percent of all biopsy specimens (159 and 161, respectively). One of every five operative fields was shown to have glandular elements in at least one of the biopsy sites; the positive biopsies did not form a discernible pattern.

We interpret these changes in morphology to be the result of differences in growth between the operated and unoperated groups. Periosteal elevation alone (n = 6) resulted in a minimal local growth increase. Coronal suture plating (n = 8) resulted in local growth restriction with contralateral and adjacent size increases. Frontal bone plating (n = 6) without crossing a suture line also resulted in local growth restriction and adjacent bone size increases. The timing of intervention in relation to the completion of bone growth may explain the magnitude of clinically apparent effects. Changes in bones adjacent to those directly manipulated may be an attempt to maintain a normal skull volume.\r"

The ear framework, exaggeratedly carved using autologous rib cartilage, could be inserted easily between the two flaps, simultaneously producing the auriculocephalic angle and the conchal wall. Intraoperative expansion of the skin flap and postoperative external ear molding also were performed to create aesthetically pleasing ears.\r"

The unilateral cleft lip and palate sample was treated by the same surgeon and orthodontist using the same techniques and appliances. Measures of overall facial proportions, facial convexity, and prognathism were not significantly different between the two groups. The primary group differences pertain to the posterior aspect of the maxilla, which is vertically short in the unilateral cleft lip and palate sample. Horizontally, the maxilla of the unilateral cleft lip and palate children was significantly longer, producing a steeper palatal plane. In addition, the zygoma and orbits of unilateral cleft lip and palate children were somewhat retruded; the posterior cranial base and total mandibular length also were longer in the unilateral cleft lip and palate children.\r"

This method has been used on more than 90 patients, and satisfactory outcomes have resulted in terms of maxillar development, the prevention of fistulation, and verbal functions. However, 14.3 percent of these patients exhibited a velopharyngeal incompetence that showed no potential improvement through training. In the majority of these patients, the entire raw surface of the oral cavity side could not be covered with a buccal musculomucosal flap, and as a result, postoperative contraction of the soft palate occurred. Thus a new surgical method has proven effective in which both buccal musculomucosal flaps are used as an oral lining, the nasal mucosa having been extended by Z-plasty. We have performed 25 operations using this new method and have observed no postoperative contractions of the soft palate, notwithstanding two cases (8.0 percent) of postoperative fistulation.\r"

  ".W": "The adverse effects of increased tension across a healing wound are well known. However, the effect of closing a wound in layers in order to decrease tension on the epidermis has been a source of controversy. It is hypothesized that deep tissue support decreases skin tension upon wound closure. In order to clarify this issue, a two-part study was designed to address the immediate effects of deep tissue support in vitro using fresh-frozen cadavers and in vivo on patients undergoing scheduled surgery. Closing skin tension was measured at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed with and without galeal closure and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) procedures, respectively. Deep tissue support was found to significantly (p less than 0.05) decrease skin tension at the time of skin closure at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed on fresh-frozen cadavers. Similar significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in closing skin tension also were found in vivo in patients undergoing similar surgical procedures. Stress relaxation was not found to play a significant role in contributing to this immediate decrease in closing skin tension. It would appear, therefore, that deep tissue support, in the form of galeal closure and an SMAS procedure in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures, respectively, provides increased viscoelastic support, producing immediate significant decreases in closing skin tension in these procedures. The beneficial effects on wound healing, scar formation, tension-related trophic skin changes, and possible improved long-term results are discussed.\r"

Contributing factors may have been sudden physical exertion in four of the five patients and in another salicylate ingestion. Several measures can help avoid late bleeding from the superficial temporal vessels or their branches; not using a too potent vasoconstrictive agent (epinephrine) in the local anesthetic so that the vessels will be easier to visualize; not injecting the local anesthetic too deeply or incising to deeply; dividing and ligating the superficial temporal vessel and its major branches if injured; using bipolar coagulation on small branches; and instructing patients repeatedly not to engage in strenuous activity or to ingest salicylates for at least 2 weeks after operation.\r"

The effect of these implants on the detection of early breast cancers in patients who have undergone augmentation mammaplasty remains unproven and controversial. Implants filled with medium-chain triglycerides (peanut oil) are radiolucent on mammographic examination and allow visualization of both soft-tissue masses and microcalcifications. To investigate the biocompatibility of radiolucent implants, 10 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil was injected subcutaneously into rats using silicone gel as a control. Twenty-one rabbits had two 125-cc silicone shell implants inserted on either side of the chest wall. The right-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile saline, and the left-sided shell was filled with 125 cc of sterile, nonpyrogenic peanut oil. Results were determined by both histologic and radiographic examination. Rats injected with peanut oil equivalent to 7 percent of their body weight rapidly absorbed the freely injected oil without detriment. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and tissues adjacent to the injection sites demonstrated no abnormalities. There was no evidence of allergic, toxic, inflammatory, or neoplastic response. Eighteen of 21 rabbits survived more than 3 months. Radiographs showed the oil-filled implants to be radiolucent, whereas the saline-filled controls obscured the surrounding soft and bony tissues. Histologic examination demonstrated a fibrous capsule surrounding both types of implants. Histologic examination of the lungs, liver, and kidneys showed no significant abnormalities. These and previous studies have shown peanut oil to be biocompatible when freely injected either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. This study demonstrates that a radiolucent, peanut oil-filled implant is biocompatible in animals and that further long-term studies for its use in humans are merited.\r"

  ".W": "Smooth-walled silicone implants have been widely used in breast surgery. Capsular contracture, causing undesirable firmness and spherical deformity, has been a common problem. Recent studies suggest that polyurethane-covered breast implants are associated with a lower incidence of capsular contracture. The statistical methodology employed in some of these studies, however, may be subject to criticism. Between July of 1984 and June of 1990 (72 months), 427 polyurethane breast implants were used in 279 patients and 439 smooth prostheses were used in 250 patients for a variety of aesthetic and reconstructive procedures. The occurrence of capsular contracture was carefully monitored and then analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. This method is particularly well suited to analysis of these types of clinical data because it allows for the fact that contractures occur at varying intervals after surgery and that follow-up of patients is incomplete. The probability of capsular contracture with smooth-walled prostheses was found to be significantly greater than with polyurethane-covered implants in each group of patients studied (p less than 0.05). Other complications occurred at a similar rate regardless of prosthesis type. This study supports the belief that polyurethane breast implants have a lower contracture rate; furthermore, it introduces the Kaplan-Meier method for analyzing the outcome of alternative plastic surgical therapies.\r"

Many grow to a very large size and produce significant morbidity. It is logical to assume that if these were ablated early, the life cycle could be aborted. The patient of this case study developed two spots that appeared to be typical evolving hemangiomas. One was treated and disappeared. The other was not treated and evolved into a typical strawberry hemangioma that eventually involuted. This would indicate that early treatment holds some promise.\r"

Based on our patient, the main advantage of this flap is the extreme width of the skin territory. The pedicle vessels are large and long, and the donor scar can be made in an unexposed area. This flap should be considered for use in one-stage reconstructions of large defects of both bone and skin in the leg region.\r"

Eighty-nine victims were admitted to 13 regional hospitals. Despite difficult access to the wooded crash site, early warning and prompt response by 37 volunteer fire and rescue units resulted in organized EMS triage and rapid hospital transport. This report reviews the specific injuries incurred, highlights the team management approach to a major aviation accident in a suburban area, and studies the likelihood of accidents of this magnitude. Thirty-eight patients triaged to two level I trauma centers, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center and Nassau County Medical Center, form the basis of this report. Seventeen patients were male; 21 were female. The average patient age was 33 years. Eight patients were children. The average length of stay was 30.9 days (range 2 to greater than 90 days). Twenty-six patients (including nonsurvivors) (68 percent) sustained significant multiple orthopedic injuries. The majority of fractures were open grade II to III tibia-fibula fractures. Bilaterality was commonly seen. Soft-tissue coverage of open long bone fractures was required in 10 patients (11 extremities) and included 3 microvascular muscle transfers, 7 muscle transposition flaps, and 3 skin grafts. Seven patients required open reduction and fixation of complex facial fractures (two of Le Fort II to III type, four of complex naso-orbital-ethmoid type). Plastic surgical repair of complex lacerations was common. Peripheral nerve exploration was required in three patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Even in expert hands, the diagnosis of emphysema by conventional radiography is 65% to 80% accurate, depending to a large degree on the clinical population studied. Although most patients with severe emphysema are diagnosed correctly, only half of those patients with mild-to-moderate levels of parenchymal destruction are detected. Emphysema is identified by CT as focal, unmarginated, hypodense areas unassociated with fibrosis. Emphysema also may be detected by computer programs selecting pixels with abnormally low attenuation values. By either method, CT is superior to chest radiography in detection of mild and moderate degrees of emphysema and has detection rates of more than 90% and correlation with extent and severity of disease in more than 80% of patients. CT may be more sensitive to the presence of mild emphysema than pulmonary function tests, which are global indications of lung function. HRCT appears to offer a small, but real, advantage over 10-mm collimation in identification of small areas of emphysema, but areas of emphysema smaller than 0.5 cm in diameter are commonly missed, even with HRCT. Wider use of CT for investigation of relatively asymptomatic smokers may allow early diagnosis of emphysema and provide more information of the natural history of this disease, information that is sorely lacking at this time. Assessment of potential therapy such as smoking cessation or antioxidants will only be possible with widespread use of a method that is of relatively low risk, easy to duplicate, and accurate.\r"

Although the mechanism of 67Ga localization is not established firmly, the isotope appears to act as a tracer for disturbed protein and cellular fluxes within the interstitium and alveolar spaces. The radiolabeled aerosol study may also be applied to the study of these fluxes as a reflection of inflammation and injury. Although Tc-DTPA clearance studies are highly sensitive to lung injury, they may be too nonspecific to separate lung injury from other physiologic processes effectively.\r"

  ".W": "The pneumoconioses, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, lung damage due to irritant gases, fumes, and smoke constitute the occupational lung diseases that affect the lung parenchyma. The pneumoconioses are diseases resulting from the accumulation of dust in the lungs. The ILO has established a standardized system for classification of these pneumoconioses that includes both descriptions of diffuse lung opacities and pleural disease. The most common of the fibrogenic pneumoconioses are silicosis, CWP, and asbestosis. The former two entities are characterized radiographically by the presence of small rounded opacities or nodules in the lung parenchyma. Eggshell calcification may occur in lymph nodes, and eventually the diseases may be complicated by the development of large massive areas of fibrosis in the upper lung zones. Asbestosis, on the other hand, demonstrates small irregular or linear opacities usually confined to the bases of the lungs. It is associated with significant respiratory symptoms and disability. High resolution CT has proved useful in characterizing the parenchymal changes and also in identifying early disease in all of these entities. Berylliosis is a systemic disorder that in its chronic form produces granulomatous disease in the lungs. Radiographically it is characterized by the development of either small rounded or occasionally irregular linear opacities usually confined to the bases. Chemical pneumonitis results from exposure to toxic fumes. The acute reaction may produce diffuse lung injury characterized by air-space disease typical of pulmonary edema. In the chronic form, bronchiolitis obliterans supervenes. This usually is associated with either a normal radiograph or evidence of hyperinflation. Finally, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a response of the lung to inhalation of antigens that may be present in the workplace. Either acute, subacute, or chronic disease may result. In the chronic form, a diffuse reticulonodular pattern with or without associated lymphadenopathy is characteristic.\r"

To identify the cause of this pattern, specimens of histologically defined HCC with high- (n = 21), iso- (n = 6), and low- (n = 22) intensity patterns were histologically evaluated for paramagnetic ionic forms of metals. The incidence of steatosis, clear cell formation, and copper accumulation was statistically (P less than .01) higher in tumors with the high-intensity pattern than in those with other patterns. Of 17 HCCs that stained positive for copper, 16 (94%) had a high-intensity pattern; the pattern of one tumor (6%) was isointense. All 21 tumors with the high-intensity pattern had at least one of the findings of steatosis, clear cell formation, or copper accumulation. These features were evident in only four of 28 tumors (14%) with an iso- or low-intensity pattern. Thus, copper accumulation might be a cause of the high-intensity pattern on T1-weighted images of small HCCs.\r"

Electron x-ray microanalysis of one of them revealed copper. The high attenuation value at nonenhanced CT may have been due to the abundant copper-binding protein in the cancer cells. The difference between orcein staining results and attenuation patterns at CT was statistically significant (chi 2, P less than .001). It could not be concluded that the paramagnetic effects of copper in HCC had an influence on signal intensity on MR images. The difference between orcein staining results and signal-intensity patterns on T1- and T2-weighted images was not statistically significant.\r"

  ".W": "The authors compared three T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging techniques that acquire images encompassing the entire liver in one breath hold. Twenty healthy volunteers were imaged--10 at 1.0 T and 10 at 1.5 T--and the results compared with those of regular short repetition time/echo time spin-echo imaging. Rapid acquisition spin echo was resistant to artifacts and had good image quality but had the lowest liver signal-to-noise (S/N) and spleen-liver signal-difference-to-noise (SD/N) values. Fast low-angle shot (FLASH) had the highest S/N and SD/N, very good image quality, and only mild artifacts. TurboFLASH had good S/N and SD/N, but reduced matrix size decreased image quality. All three sequences had better SD/N than regular spin echo, and FLASH and TurboFLASH had higher S/N. On the basis of this study, the FLASH sequence appears the most attractive for T1-weighted breath-hold imaging.\r"

Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted, spin-echo imaging was performed during a 23-second breath hold in 38 patients, with images acquired before, during, and at 1,2, and 5 minutes after bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Enhancement patterns of normal liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal gland, kidney, aorta, inferior vena cava, and fat were determined by visual evaluation and by performance of signal intensity measurements with an electronic cursor. Time-intensity curves demonstrated peak enhancement of all abdominal organs during or immediately after bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. MR enhancement patterns included visualization of renal cortical nephrogram and heterogeneous enhancement of the spleen during the bolus phase of contrast material administration. Peak enhancement of normal liver was 72%; spleen, 172%; pancreas, 82%; adrenal gland, 85%; and kidney, 291%. This study established reference data regarding abdominal organ enhancement that will be useful as dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging becomes clinically implemented.\r"

After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules.\r"

Successful hemostasis was achieved in all patients. The mean length of survival was 165 days in group A and 13 days in group B. A significant correlation (P less than .00003) between serum bilirubin level and prognosis was obtained. While tumor thrombus in the portal vein made the prognosis poor, there was no significant difference in prognosis between groups with and without tumor thrombus (P = .145). Emergency embolization is an effective treatment in patients with intraperitoneal hemorrhage from HCC. The prognosis for patients with HCC depends on the serum bilirubin level before embolization.\r"

All patients underwent subsequent hepatic tumor resection within 4 days. After computer-generated mapping of hepatic venous structures with high attenuation and metastases with low attenuation, 3D reconstruction was performed. Thirty-six of the 40 lesions (90%) were detected with 2D and 3D CTAP. The accuracy in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases was 78% (28 of the 36 metastases) for 2D CTAP and 94% (34 of the 36 metastases) for 3D CTAP. The difference in localization rates between 2D CTAP and 3D CTAP was statistically significant. The 3D CTAP technique provides vital data unattainable with other imaging modalities that improve the preoperative assessment of the resectability of hepatic metastases and allows planning a safer surgical approach.\r"

Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma. Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma. A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma. Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat. Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm.\r"

An injection of 0.25-0.50 cm3 of air, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide into the jejunal vein of nine dogs yielded identical portal venous sonographic and Doppler patterns. In addition, the liver parenchyma of the dogs became hyperechogenic after the injection of gas. Gas in the PV is accompanied by the following signs: echogenic, moving foci within the lumen of the PV; sharp spikes on Doppler spectral display; and hyperechogenic foci within the liver parenchyma.\r"

For most cardiac MR imaging protocols, either long TE and short repetition time or exogenous intravascular agents are used for generating contrast between the ventricular wall and cavity as well as detecting pathologic conditions of the ventricular wall. The major problem with long-TE images is that the motion of the heart degrades the spatial resolution of the image during the TE period. However, MTC is generated by an off-resonance irradiation during the interpulse delay period that is relatively insensitive to motion artifacts. Short-TE (5-15 msec) gradient-recalled echo sequences were used for imaging the heart with and without MTC. These studies revealed that MTC can be used to greatly improve the contrast between the myocardial wall and blood chamber in short-TE images and may provide useful parameters for tissue characterization in pathologic cardiac muscle.\r"

The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes. After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats. The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip. The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions. The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Findings at MR were compared with findings at Doppler echocardiography. Velocity measurements in a flow phantom with cine MR correlated well with direct measurements at Doppler echocardiography. Velocity-encoded cine MR enabled accurate and reproducible measurement of absolute blood flow in healthy subjects. Oblique-gradient flow encoding (ie, flow-encoding direction coinciding with the true direction of flow) was the method of choice for velocity measurements in the right and left pulmonary arteries.\r"
