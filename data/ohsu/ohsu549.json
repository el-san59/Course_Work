In the 2 cases with RV hypoplasia and in one case, in whom all chordae of the AV valve were connected to a single right ventricular papillary muscle (AVSD type Rastelli B), complete repair was not feasible. In addition, angiography revealed coronary artery variations in 5/18 (28%), which did not preclude surgical repair.

The cumulative patency rates of the former and the recent group at 5 years were as follows: aorto-femoral, 75.2% and 86.7% (P less than 0.05); femoral-distal, 34.6% and 61.5% (P less than 0.001); extra-anatomical, 63.6% and 80.2% (P = 0.06), respectively. Based on the various flow waveforms evidenced intraoperatively, the cumulative patency rate of cases in the recent group with type 0 and I flow waveform was compared to the rate of those with type II flow waveform. The cumulative patency rates at 5 years were as follows: aorto-femoral, 92% and 82.7% (P = 0.15); femoral-distal, 77.7% and 49.3% (P less than 0.001); extra-anatomical, 91.8% and 68.9% (P less than 0.05), respectively. These results indicate that intraoperative flow waveform analysis is a simple and useful indicator for predicting the long-term results of arterial reconstruction.\r"

Freezing of veins seems to decrease or abolish antigenicity by decreasing the viable cellular components of the grafts. To confirm its acceptance and consequently, the high patency rates of freeze-preserved vein grafts, we inserted segments of human veins preserved at -80 degrees Centigrade as arterial substitutes into rabbits, cats, and dogs and studied the morphological changes of these xenografts up to 2 years. In all the groups, the patency rate was satisfactory. In rabbits and dogs, the cellular inflammatory reaction around the grafts and suture lines disappeared after a few weeks; the endothelium was reconstructed at 2 months and a poorly differentiated cellular fibro-collagenous wall with prominent hyalin matrix was observed. In cats, however, the histio-lymphocytic infiltrate persisted in functioning grafts up to 2 years associated with adjacent prominent vascular and nerve proliferation. It is suggested that this inflammatory reaction has no deleterious effect on the graft; on the contrary, it promotes its neovascularisation and innervation. The cat proved to be a good animal model for vascular surgical experiments. Our study proved the poor antigenicity of freeze-preserved venous xenograft. It could, in the future, be used for human arterial substitutes.\r"

Distal embolization to the tibial arteries and to the foot arch and digital vessels is common but is not emphasized in the literature. This distal embolization may precipitate severe ischemia which may preclude reconstruction or compromise the results of repair of the popliteal lesion. Early repair of the muscle anomaly is advocated even in the asymptomatic limb.

  ".U": "89174953\r", 
  ".W": "Paraplegia secondary to spinal cord ischemia is a too frequent devastating complication of thoracic aneurysm surgery. We examined the ability of veno-arterial bypass (VAB) to ensure adequate spinal cord blood flow during aortic cross-clamping by monitoring spinal cord function via somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP's) and postoperative motor function. Dogs were placed on VAB using a heparin-bonded roller pump circuit without systemic heparinization. SEP latency and amplitude were monitored continuously. The respirator FIO2 was set at 100% while the aorta was cross-clamped for one hour with the bypass adjusted to keep distal arterial pressure at greater than 60 mmHg. After one hour the aorta was unclamped, bypass discontinued, and the animals recovered. SEP's were always present during VAB as long as the distal pressure was kept at greater than 60 mmHg. There were several transient hypotensive episodes (less than 5 min) which were accompanied by reversible loss of SEP's. None of the animals displayed any gait abnormalities post-op. These findings using this simple bypass technique suggest the following conclusions: (1) SEP's degenerate (increased latency and decreased amplitude) in response to hypoxia; (2) spinal cord function can be maintained for up to one hour during hypoxic conditions; (3) SEP's can be used to monitor sensory spinal cord function under these conditions; and (4) heparinless VAB can provide spinal cord protection while also allowing monitoring of SEP's to ensure adequate spinal cord perfusion.\r"

The 5-year recurrence rate for Mohs micrographic surgery is 5.6%. The recurrence rate for non-Mohs modalities of 19.9% is nearly four times higher. Individual recurrence rates for the non-Mohs modalities are 17.4% for surgical excision, 40.0% for curettage and electrodesiccation, and 9.8% for radiation therapy. There are no studies reporting 5-year data for cryotherapy. However, the recurrence rate is 13.0% for cryotherapy when the follow-up period is less than five years. The data support the following conclusions: (1) Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for recurrent BCC; (2) if the patient is not a surgical candidate and the lesion is small, radiation therapy is an alternative that offers a better chance for cure than the other non-Mohs modalities; and (3) curettage and electrodesiccation should not be used to treat recurrent basal cell carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Whether mitral insufficiency is a marker of decreased left ventricular function in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for sever aortic stenosis was examined. Hemodynamic measurements in 26 patients with pure aortic stenosis (Group 1), 17 patients with aortic stenosis and grade 1 or 2 mitral insufficiency (Group 2) and 19 control patients were compared. All patients were free of significant coronary artery disease. Ventriculograms were digitized for calculation of ejection fraction, ventricular volumes and wall stress. Despite similar aortic valve areas, Group 2 patients had more advanced symptoms. Cardiac index was comparably decreased in Group 1 (2.6 +/- 0.4 liters/min per m2) and Group 2 (2.7 +/- 0.8 liters/min per m2) compared with the control group (3.8 +/- 0.6 liters/min per m2). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes were increased only in Group 2 (119 +/- 35 and 73 +/- 36 ml/m2, respectively). Likewise, end-systolic wall stress was increased only in Group 2 (149 +/- 54 kdynes/cm2). Ejection fraction was decreased to a greater extent in Group 2 (42 +/- 17%) than in Group 1 (59 +/- 13%) as compared with values in the control group (68 +/- 5%). Although an inverse relation existed between ejection fraction and end-systolic stress in all groups, the ejection fraction (extrapolated to end-systolic stress = 0) was decreased in Group 2, and the slope of the relation was increased in Groups 1 and 2. The end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, an index of ventricular performance, was also decreased to a greater extent in Group 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the significance of hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression, 329 consecutive patients with angina and documented coronary artery disease who underwent hyperventilation and exercise tests during pharmacologic washout were studied. The hyperventilation test induced ST segment depression in 79 patients. In 36 of these 79 patients, the electrocardiographic changes occurred early during overbreathing (Group I), whereas in 26 they occurred late during recovery (Group II). Seventeen patients developed ST segment depression both during over-breathing and during recovery (Group III). Group I patients had a higher frequency of history of angina during exercise, multivessel disease and lower tolerance to exercise as compared with patients in Group II. In Group I, the rate-pressure product at the time to onset of ST depression during overbreathing was similar to that during exercise (152 +/- 24 versus 148 +/- 42; p = NS), whereas in Group II the rate-pressure product at the time to onset of ST depression during recovery was comparable with that under control conditions (104 +/- 30 versus 98 +/- 27; p = NS) and far less than that required to produce ischemia during exercise (104 +/- 30 versus 201 +/- 56; p less than 0.0011). In nine Group III patients, the acute administration of propranolol prevented the early hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression, whereas nifedipine abolished the delayed hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression. These findings suggest that early hyperventilation-induced ST segment depression is due to increased oxygen demand in patients with poor coronary reserve and may be prevented by beta-adrenergic blockers, which are useful for lowering oxygen consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Extent of left ventricular hypertrophy was assessed with two-dimensional echocardiography in 173 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who ranged in age from 21 to 74 years (mean 45) and had mild to severe cardiac symptoms. The overall study group was classified into five age subgroups (each corresponding to a decade); maximal left ventricular wall thickness and wall thickness index (a quantitative expression of the overall extent of hypertrophy) were assessed in each group. These two indexes were significantly higher in patients 21 to 30 years of age than in patients in each of the other four older age groups. The two indexes of left ventricular hypertrophy were also significantly higher in patients 31 to 40 years of age than in patients who were 61 to 74 years old. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the relation between wall thickness and age was not influenced by other clinical variables such as severity of symptoms, presence of subaortic obstruction, left ventricular cavity dimension and gender. In conclusion, the findings indicate that, in a population of symptomatic adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy is considerably more severe in younger than in older patients and that there is an inverse relation between left ventricular wall thickness and age.\r"

In 10 patients with mitral stenosis (1 man and 9 women; mean age +/- SD 47 +/- 7 years), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was measured through an 8F Goodale-Lubin catheter with its wedge position confirmed by oximetry (oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 95%). In addition, a transseptal left atrial pressure was measured through a Brockenbrough catheter and left ventricular pressure was measured through a pigtail catheter. The mean and phasic left atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar (mean left atrial pressure 18 +/- 6 mm Hg; mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 18 +/- 8 mm Hg; p = NS). When the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was used without adjustment for time delay, the transvalvular pressure gradient (9.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) and valve area (1.5 +/- 0.5 cm2) were significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the values obtained with use of left atrial pressure (7.2 +/- 2.9 mm Hg and 1.7 +/- 0.6 cm2, respectively). In contrast, when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was adjusted for the time delay through the pulmonary vasculature, the difference in gradients averaged only 1.7 mm Hg and the mitral valve areas were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ability to identify acutely and chronically injured tissue has been demonstrated in a number of animal studies, but data in humans are limited. The present study tested the hypothesis that quantitative echocardiographic texture analysis, a method of evaluating the spatial pattern of echoes in echocardiographic images, would differentiate amyloid and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from normal myocardium. Routine clinical echocardiographic data were obtained on 34 subjects at the Mayo Clinic (10 normal subjects, 10 patients with amyloid heart disease, 8 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 6 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension). Standard videotape recordings of these echocardiograms were analyzed at the University of Iowa. Echocardiographic data were digitized with use of a calibrated, 256 gray level digitization system. Quantitative texture analysis was performed on data from the ventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall in end-diastolic and end-systolic, short-axis and long-axis echocardiographic images. The gray level run length texture variables were able to discriminate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and amyloid heart disease from normal myocardium and from each other (p less than 0.0083 for comparisons of the quantitative texture features of amyloid versus hypertrophic cardiomyopathy versus normal by multivariate analysis of variance). The texture of the myocardium in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy not associated with amyloid or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was in general not significantly different from that of normal myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Radionuclide ventriculography before and after intravenous dipyridamole infusion was compared with the results of exercise radionuclide ventriculography in a prospective study of 31 patients undergoing coronary angiography. Among these patients, 21 (68%) had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis), 19 (61%) had severe coronary disease (greater than or equal to 70% stenosis) and 10 (32%) were \"normal\" (less than 50% stenosis). The left ventricular ejection fraction was calculated, and regional wall motion was scored on a 6 unit scale. In the normal patients, the ejection fraction (+/- SEM) increased 5.6 +/- 2% (units) during exercise and 7.9 +/- 1 units after dipyridamole (both p less than or equal to 0.004 compared with that during rest). However, in patients with coronary artery disease, the ejection fraction failed to increase during exercise or after dipyridamole. In the patients with coronary artery disease, regional wall motion decreased by 4.1 +/- 0.5 units during exercise (p less than 0.003) and by 1.8 units after dipyridamole (p less than 0.02). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated general comparability between the sensitivity and specificity of exercise and dipyridamole ventriculography, with \"optimal\" operating points that favored choosing high sensitivity for the former and high specificity for the latter. Specific subsets of patients with severe coronary atherosclerosis were analyzed with use of these criteria. In patients with severe stenosis (greater than or equal to 70%), the sensitivity of dipyridamole ventriculography was 67% compared with 89% for exercise ventriculography. However, at these levels of sensitivity, the specificity of dipyridamole ventriculography was 92% compared with 67% for exercise ventriculography. In this and other subsets of patients, the specificity of dipyridamole ventriculography exceeded that of exercise ventriculography. Thus, it is concluded that dipyridamole radionuclide ventriculography is moderately sensitive and highly specific for detecting severe coronary atherosclerosis. This technique provides a widely applicable, useful alternative to exercise ventriculography in the diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis in patients who have limited exercise tolerance.\r"

A more physiologic method of assessing the results of coronary angioplasty would involve assessment of myocardial perfusion in the affected coronary bed. Contrast two-dimensional echocardiography provides information about regional myocardial perfusion. To assess the correlation between pre- to postcoronary angioplasty changes in gradient or percent stenosis and the increase in peak contrast intensity, 23 consecutive patients were studied during coronary angioplasty. In 19 of the 23 patients, the coronary angioplasty was successful and in 15 (79%) of the 19, an adequate echocardiographic study was obtained. Mild and transient side effects of echo contrast were observed in 3 of the 15 patients. The gradient across the residual lesions decreased from 52 +/- 12 to 11 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD), the diameter of the stenotic lesion decreased from 89 +/- 10 to 25 +/- 16% and corrected peak contrast intensity (peak contrast - baseline contrast in gray level U/pixel) increased from 15 +/- 16 to 50 +/- 26. All these differences were significant at the p less than 0.001 level. Corrected peak contrast intensity correlated exponentially with the decrease in pressure gradient (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001). The correlation curve had a greater increase in peak contrast intensity at gradient decreases greater than 45 mm Hg. Corrected peak contrast intensity did not correlate with decrease in diameter of the stenotic lesion (r = 0.19).\r"

Forty patients with cardiomyopathy formed the study group (20 with an apical thrombus and 20 without). The groups did not differ with respect to age, gender, origin of ventricular dysfunction, ventricular size and ejection fraction. Guided by the Doppler color flow pattern, a quantitative analysis of flow velocity profile in the ventricular inflow and outflow \"compartments\" was performed by serial pulsed wave Doppler sampling. Inflow velocity at the ventricular apex was significantly lower in the thrombus group than in the no thrombus group (11.7 +/- 15.3 versus 28.3 +/- 10.5 cm/s, p less than 0.0001). Flow velocities were generally lower in the thrombus group at the other levels in the inflow compartment (that is, mitral anulus, leaflet tips and papillary muscle level). The systolic flow velocity at the apex was similarly significantly lower in the thrombus group than in the no thrombus group (7.1 +/- 8.1 versus 15.3 +/- 7.0 cm/s, p less than 0.001). Additionally, a higher prevalence of mitral regurgitation was noted in the no thrombus group (14 patients) than in the thrombus group (3 patients). Thus, specific abnormal flow profiles are associated with a left ventricular thrombus. Whether the abnormal flow is a primary event in the genesis of left ventricular thrombus or occurs secondary to development of the thrombus cannot be determined from this study.\r"

A new mapping grid, based on biplanar fluoroscopic imaging of the heart, was utilized for the definition of left ventricular endocardial sites. On the basis of QRS configurations resulting from left ventricular endocardial pacing at disparate sites in 22 patients (Group I), ECG features that were specific for particular sites were identified and used to construct an algorithm. Apical and basal sites were differentiated by the QRS configuration in leads V4 and aVR, anterior and inferior sites by that in leads II, III and V6 and septal and lateral sites were differentiated using leads I, aVL and V1. The algorithm was used to predict the site of earliest endocardial activation during 44 episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia in a second group of 42 patients (Group II) in a blinded fashion. Anterior sites were correctly predicted in 83% of cases, inferior sites in 84%, septal sites in 90% and lateral sites in 82% of cases. Apical and basal sites were each correctly predicted in 70% of cases, whereas intermediate sites were less well predicted (29 to 55%) on the basis of QRS configuration. Precise localization of the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia (in all three planes) was achieved in 17 cases (39%), and in 16 cases (36%) the site of origin was immediately adjacent to the predicted site. Prediction of the site of origin of ventricular tachycardia from the 12 lead ECG may serve as a useful, time-saving adjunct to, but not a substitute for, activation sequence mapping during ventricular tachycardia.\r"

Holter electrocardiographic monitoring revealed incessant ventricular tachycardia in one patient and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in three others. Exercise testing revealed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in one patient. Ventricular fibrillation was induced at the time of programmed electrical stimulation in four of the six patients. Documented recurrence of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular flutter occurred in three patients, but in only one patient receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. Four patients were treated with amiodarone and one received an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. All patients are alive after a mean follow-up period of 78 months after the first documentation of their arrhythmia and 37 months after programmed electrical stimulation. Ventricular fibrillation can occur in the apparently structurally normal human heart. Antiarrhythmic treatment can provide effective control of this malignant arrhythmia.\r"

The diagnoses were anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk in five patients, a coronary artery to left ventricle fistula or coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula in four patients with other complex defects, right ventricular sinusoids in two patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum and an isolated coronary artery fistula in two patients. In all cases, the abnormal coronary connection was recognized on the basis of an abnormal, continuous or to and fro flow pattern in the fistula and its connections as demonstrated by scanning in multiple views with Doppler color flow mapping.

In Protocol I, potassium chloride was administered into the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery at a rate of 0.125 mEq/min for either 20 min or until [K+]o = 20 mEq/liter, whichever came first. In Protocol II, the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded in one step and was reperfused 20 min later. Fifteen dogs were subjected to Protocol I, nine of which were also subjected to Protocol II. In the latter group, a recovery period of greater than or equal to 1 h separated the two protocols. Local K+ and intramyocardial activities were recorded with use of bifunctional ion-sensitive plunge electrodes at multiple sites located in the region of the left ventricle perfused by the left anterior descending artery and at one site outside of this region. The following variables were recorded and analyzed: Lead II electrocardiogram, heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, local [K+]o and its time derivative (dK+/dt), local electrograms and ventricular arrhythmias. Maximal [K+]o and dK+/dt were 23 +/- 3 mEq/liter and 9 +/- 1 mEq/liter per min in Protocol I and 14 +/- 1 mEq/liter and 3 +/- 1 mEq/liter per min in Protocol II, respectively. In both protocols, the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias correlated with [K+]o (p less than 0.02) as well as with dK+/dt (p less than 0.05). Ventricular arrhythmias were more frequent and more severe in Protocol II than in Protocol I (p less than 0.05). Therefore, whereas K+ dynamics were more pronounced in Protocol I, ventricular arrhythmias were more severe in Protocol II. This occurrence was apparently due, at least in part, to less heterogeneous changes in K+ gradients during constant K+ infusion. It was concluded that, in addition to the magnitude of [K+]o, the rate of change of this variable (that is, dK+/dt) apparently plays an important role in the genesis of ischemic ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

The filling fractions between 10% and 70% of the diastolic time interval were greater in patients with pericardial constriction than in those with restrictive cardiomyopathy (p less than 0.01 between 20% and 50%, p less than 0.05 at 10%, 60% and 70%), with no overlap. The filling fractions in patients with pericardial constriction were also greater than those in normal subjects between 10% and 60% of the diastolic time interval. The filling fraction was lower in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy than in normal subjects at 40% of the diastolic time interval (p less than 0.05).

Of the 70 patients, 36% were hospitalized and 64% were ambulatory at the time of evaluation. The average age was 37 years; 93% were homosexual men. Echocardiographic findings included dilated cardiomyopathy in eight patients (11%), pericardial effusions in seven patients (10%) (one with impending tamponade), pleural effusion in four patients (6%) and mediastinal mass in one patient (1%). Among the 25 hospitalized patients, echocardiographic abnormalities were noted in 16 (64%), whereas among the 45 ambulatory patients, the only abnormality noted was mitral valve prolapse in 3 patients (7%) (p less than 0.0001). Dilated cardiomyopathy was the only echocardiographic lesion more common in the 25 hospitalized patients than in 20 hospitalized control patients with acute leukemia. Symptoms of congestive heart failure responded to conventional therapy. Cardiac lesions were associated with active Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and low T helper lymphocyte counts. Dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown origin may be more common than was previously recognized in hospitalized, acutely ill patients with AIDS, but is uncommon in ambulatory patients with HIV infection. Echocardiography should be considered in the evaluation of dyspnea in hospitalized patients with HIV infection, especially those with dyspnea that is out of proportion to the degree of pulmonary disease.\r"

A significant reduction in the transaortic pressure gradient from 77 +/- 7.8 to 31 +/- 6.2 mm Hg (p = 0.002) and increase in calculated aortic valve area from 0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.3 cm2 (p = 0.05) was noted. Three of the seven procedures were performed anterograde with use of transseptal puncture: two of the three because of abdominal aortic aneurysm and one because of peripheral vascular disease. All seven patients underwent uncomplicated noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia 10 +/- 4.3 days (range 0 to 29) after aortic valvuloplasty. One patient had exploratory laparotomy, one underwent stabilization of a hip fracture and two underwent resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Of the three other patients who underwent colectomy, one had repeat aortic valvuloplasty and repair of a hip fracture 7 months later and one required exploratory laparotomy without repeat valvuloplasty 7 weeks later. Percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty is an effective and safe procedure that may reduce the risk of general anesthesia and major noncardiac surgery in elderly patients with aortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether pharmacologic coronary vasodilation could provoke new left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients with single vessel coronary artery disease, systemic hemodynamics, coronary blood flow velocity and left ventricular wall motion were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography during administration of 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine in 14 patients before and again immediately after left coronary angioplasty (group 1). As a comparison with an intravenous method, left ventricular wall motion was analyzed after 0.56 mg/kg body weight of intravenous dipyridamole in a separate group of 13 patients with single vessel coronary disease (group 2). Heart rate-blood pressure product increased 3% to 6% in papaverine-treated patients and 14 +/- 11% (p = NS) in dipyridamole-treated patients. No angiographic collateral vessels were present in either group. Although intracoronary mean flow velocity measured in the 14 group 1 patients and in 5 normal control subjects during papaverine treatment increased from 125% to 400% of basal flow velocity, papaverine induced new left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in only 5 of the 14 patients before coronary angioplasty. In three of five patients, left ventricular wall motion abnormalities persisted after successful coronary angioplasty. Four of the 14 patients demonstrated augmentation of left ventricular wall motion with papaverine. After intravenous dipyridamole, only 3 of the 13 group 2 patients developed new left ventricular regional asynergy. These data suggest that selective (papaverine) and, most likely, global (dipyridamole) augmentation of coronary flow alone does not reliably identify potential ischemic left ventricular regions affected by critical single vessel coronary artery disease.\r"

The subjects' ages ranged from 15 to 73 years. Mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation was observed in 15 of 20 patients in Group 1 and in all 16 patients in Group 2. M-mode Doppler color echocardiography demonstrated a mitral regurgitant signal throughout systole and isovolumic relaxation in all but 1 of these 31 patients regardless of the pattern of the systolic murmur. The regurgitant signal was recorded after the click in only one patient with mitral valve prolapse in Group 1. Two of the five patients in Group 1 without two-dimensional echocardiographic findings of mitral valve prolapse had the early systolic signal of mitral regurgitation. The timing and duration of the mitral regurgitant signal detected in patients in Group 1 with pulsed or continuous wave Doppler ultrasound varied with the site of the sample volume or beam direction. In the patients in Group 2, however, the signal was demonstrated throughout systole and isovolumic relaxation by both Doppler methods. Compared with M-mode Doppler color echocardiography, therefore, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler methods were less sensitive and thus inadequate to investigate the timing and duration of mitral regurgitation in mitral valve prolapse, especially in patients with a mid-systolic click or a late systolic murmur, or both, who had mild or eccentric mitral regurgitant jets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Segmental analysis was done in the right anterior oblique projection using a long axis with three perpendicular, equidistant chords. The apical segment in the 12 patients with coronary artery disease represented the ischemic region. In 5 of the 12 patients with coronary artery disease, the basal segment that showed no exercise-induced deterioration in wall motion was used as an intrapatient control (nonischemic segment). In the 12 patients with coronary artery disease, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased (from 65% to 50%, p less than 0.001), end-diastolic pressure increased (from 24 to 40 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and the lowest diastolic filling pressure increased (from 9 to 22 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) during exercise-induced ischemia. In normal subjects, ejection fraction increased (from 64% to 70%, p less than 0.01) with unchanged end-diastolic pressure, whereas the lowest diastolic filling pressure decreased during exercise (from 9 to 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Global left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume curves showed an upward and rightward shift during exercise-induced ischemia. Regional pressure-length curves of both nonischemic (n = 5) and ischemic (n = 12) segments were shifted upward in early diastole, but moved to a higher portion of the rest pressure-length curve without an upward shift during mid- to end-diastole. In contrast, the apical segment in normal subjects showed a downward shift during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the feasibility of using this new technique for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, 27 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for diagnosis of chest pain were evaluated. Fifteen patients had significant (greater than 50%) coronary artery stenosis by quantitative coronary angiography. One vessel disease was found in 12 patients and multivessel disease in 3. Fourteen (93%) of the 15 patients with significant coronary stenosis had a decrease in ultrafast computed tomographic ejection fraction during exercise from (mean +/- SD) 65 +/- 7% to 60 +/- 7% (p less than 0.001). The tomographic ejection fraction increased greater than 5% units during exercise in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients with normal coronary arteries. The mean tomographic ejection fraction in this group was 68 +/- 6% at rest and 75 +/- 6% at peak exercise (p less than 0.001). Regional wall motion was quantified by analyzing the segmental ejection fraction of 12 30 degree pie segments at each tomographic level of the left ventricle. A new regional wall motion abnormality developed during exercise in 12 (86%) of 14 patients with coronary artery disease; one patient was excluded because of a technical problem in data storage. Eleven (93%) of the 12 patients with normal coronary arteries had normal wall motion during exercise. In no patient with ischemic heart disease were both variables, ejection fraction response and regional wall motion, normal. Exercise ultrafast computed tomography appears to be a useful technique for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain and predominant single vessel coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three had a very small left ventricle and aortic anulus. In one infant, the aortic valve could not be passed, and in another infant, a technical error resulted in severe valvular damage, aortic insufficiency and death. Among the eight patients who had effective dilation, the stenosis was relieved in seven as assessed by a significant decrease in transvalvular pressure gradient, improvement of left ventricular contraction and eventual inversion of the ductal shunting. The procedure failed in the only patient whose dilation was performed with an undersized balloon. Aortic insufficiency occurred in three infants and was severe (perforated cusp) in one, moderate in one whose valve was dilated with an excessively large balloon and mild and transient in one. None of the three infants with a very small left ventricle recovered (two died and one underwent cardiac transplantation). Among the seven infants with a left ventricle of acceptable size, three underwent subsequent aortic valvotomy; one of these died and two bad good results. The remaining four are doing well 16 +/- 5 months later (mean +/- SD) with mild to moderate residual aortic stenosis and normal left ventricular function. In conclusion, percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is an acceptable alternative to surgery in neonates with critical aortic valve stenosis. Incidence of complications and good relief of the obstruction depend on a careful technique. Immediate results are similar to those of surgery. Late prognosis depends on the quality of the left heart structures.\r"

At valvuloplasty the patients ranged in age from 0.35 to 16 years and had undergone surgical valvotomy 0.3 to 12.5 years previously. Balloon valvuloplasty immediately reduced the peak systolic aortic stenosis gradient by 53%, from 88 +/- 9 (mean +/- SEM) to 41 +/- 6 mm Hg (p = 0.004). The left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 189 +/- 8 to 157 +/- 8 mm Hg (p = 0.001) and the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 17 +/- 1 to 14 +/- 2 mm Hg (p = 0.025). The heart rate and cardiac index remained unchanged. Before valvuloplasty, one patient had 1 + and two patients had 2+ aortic insufficiency. In six of nine patients, balloon valvuloplasty caused no change in the degree of valvular insufficiency. Two patients had a 1 + increase (from 0 to 1 + insufficiency in both), and one patient with no insufficiency developed 2+ aortic insufficiency. Elective follow-up catheterization was performed 0.8 to 2.5 years (mean 1.5 +/- 0.2) after valvuloplasty. At follow-up, the peak aortic stenosis gradient remained significantly reduced from the gradient before valvuloplasty (37 +/- 5 versus 85 +/- 10 mm Hg, p = 0.002). The gradient had not changed significantly from that measured immediately after valvuloplasty (37 +/- 5 versus 38 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = 0.75). At follow-up, aortic insufficiency had decreased from that immediately after valvuloplasty in three patients and had increased in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, 114 serial two-dimensional Doppler color flow mapping studies were performed to define ventricular septal defect anatomy, location and color flow diameter as an indicator of shunt size in 66 patients (over a 40 month period). Twenty-five patients first studied at 6 months of age (mean age at most recent study 15.9 months) had congestive heart failure and 41 (mean age 45 months) did not. In the congestive heart failure group, there were 24 perimembranous and 1 muscular ventricular septal defect and aneurysm formation was present in 17. Mean (+/- SD) color flow diameter was 8.2 +/- 1.9 mm and color flow diameter/aortic root diameter ratio was 0.63. In the 30 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, color flow diameter bore a close relation to angiographic diameter (r = 0.96) and pulmonary/systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) (r = 0.88). In the patients with congestive heart failure, 4 of the 25 ventricular septal defects, all with aneurysm present or positioned adjacent to the tricuspid valve, became smaller but none closed. Of the 41 patients without congestive heart failure, 21 had a perimembranous defect (15 with aneurysm), 18 had a muscular ventricular septal defect and 2 had a supracristal ventricular septal defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent randomized trials in acute myocardial infarction suggest that infarct size reduction need not be achieved for intravenous streptokinase to improve patient survival. If this is the case, attempts to achieve late revascularization may be justified. To assess the results of late primary coronary angioplasty performed in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, the clinical and angiographic data as well as hospital outcome of 139 consecutive patients treated with coronary angioplasty without prior thrombolytic therapy 6 to 48 h after the onset of chest pain (late group) were compared with those of 117 patients treated with primary angioplasty less than 6 h after the onset of chest pain (early group); time to angioplasty was assessed as a covariate of survival. In the 139 patients treated greater than or equal to 6 h after the onset of chest pain, the mean age (+/- SD) was 57 +/- 12 years and the median time to angioplasty was 15 h; 61% had multivessel disease, 14% were in cardiogenic shock and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 44 +/- 12%. Angioplasty was successful (final diameter stenosis less than 70% and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade greater than or equal to 2) in 78% of patients. Successful angioplasty was associated with a 5.5% in-hospital mortality rate, whereas unsuccessful angioplasty was associated with a 43% hospital mortality rate (p less than 0.001). Multivariate testing in all patients identified four independent predictors of in-hospital death: cardiogenic shock (p less than 0.001), unsuccessful angioplasty (p = 0.001), ejection fraction less than or equal to 30% (p = 0.002) and patient age (p = 0.004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Disopyramide was administered intravenously to 54 patients during atrial fibrillation and predominantly pre-excited QRS configuration at the time of electrophysiologic study. All patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and no patient had coexistent heart disease. The drug was given during sustained atrial fibrillation (n = 45) or during sinus rhythm before induction of atrial fibrillation for patients whose atrial fibrillation was self-terminating in the control state (n = 9). Atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm within 15 min after disopyramide in 37 (82%) of the 45 patients. The shortest RR intervals between two pre-excited cycles increased from 208 +/- 42 to 293 +/- 117 ms (p less than 0.0001). The average RR interval of all cycles prolonged from 332 +/- 60 to 396 +/- 117 ms(n = 45, p less than 0.0001). The 9 patients in whom pre-excitation was abolished after the drug had a significantly longer initial shortest RR interval than that of the 36 patients in whom pre-excitation persisted (246 +/- 47 versus 199 +/- 36 ms, p = 0.0022). No patients developed significant hemodynamic or other adverse effects after disopyramide. These data support the intravenous use of disopyramide in patients with normal ventricular function who have atrial fibrillation and a predominant ventricular response over an accessory atrioventricular pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Failure to objectively assess the effect of digitalis on exercise capacity has resulted in controversy regarding its use in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. To clarify this situation, maximal treadmill testing with respiratory gas exchange analysis was performed on 11 patients (mean age 57 +/- 9 years) with chronic congestive heart failure with and without digoxin therapy. Ten of the 11 had a consistent third sound gallop, and the mean ejection fraction of the group was 24 +/- 10%. Rest heart rate was significantly higher (91 +/- 16 versus 102 +/- 16 beats/min; p less than 0.05) and rest systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the absence of digoxin (130 +/- 23 versus 121 +/- 15 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). No differences in heart rate or blood pressure were observed during exercise. Significant increases in ventilatory oxygen uptake were observed with digoxin submaximally (3.0 mph, 0% grade), at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold and at maximal exercise (mean increase of 2.6 ml/kg per min; p less than 0.02). An improvement in the estimated ratio of ventilatory dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT), an index of physiologic efficiency, occurred throughout exercise during digoxin therapy, and there was a significant negative correlation between the change in maximal oxygen uptake and change in maximal estimated VD/VT (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05). Thus, digoxin therapy is associated with a significant improvement in exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure, most likely due to an improved matching of ventilation to perfusion.\r"

Because neutrophil leukocytes represent a potential source of oxygen radicals, the concept of whether depletion of neutrophils could attenuate myocardial stunning after 10 min of ischemia was examined. In 16 anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused by an extracorporeal circuit, either with (n = 8) or without (n = 8) neutrophil filters in the perfusion line. The group with filters had near total absence of neutrophils in blood perfusing the left anterior descending coronary artery territory (16 +/- 8 versus 1,826 +/- 399/microliters in the control group). Systolic myocardial shortening and end-systolic pressure-segment length relations were recorded during rest conditions and during incremental intracoronary infusion of dobutamine (5 to 15 micrograms/min) before and after 10 min of coronary flow occlusion. Before coronary occlusion, systolic myocardial shortening at rest was similar in control (15.4 +/- 1.7%) and neutropenic (12.4 +/- 2.2%) groups. Dobutamine (15 micrograms/min) resulted in increased shortening in both control (18.2 +/- 1.4%, p less than 0.01) and neutropenic (15.8 +/- 1.5%, p less than 0.05) groups and in a leftward shift of the end-systolic pressure-length relation. During coronary occlusion, collateral coronary flow to the left anterior descending coronary artery territory was not significantly different in the control (0.10 +/- 0.03 ml/min per g) and neutropenic (0.18 +/- 0.06 ml/min per g) groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To test these hypotheses with use of a non-laser thermal energy source, radiofrequency energy was delivered to postmortem human atherosclerotic vessels from a metal \"hot-tip\" catheter, block-mounted bipolar electrodes and from a prototype radiofrequency balloon catheter. Sixty-two radiofrequency doses delivered from a metal electrode tip produced dose-dependent ablation of atherosclerotic plaque, ranging from clean and shallow craters with histologic evidence of thermal compression at doses less than 40 J to tissue charring and vaporization at higher (greater than 80 J) doses. Lesion dimensions ranged between 3.14 and 3.79 mm in diameter and 0.20 and 0.47 mm in depth. Tissue perforation was not observed. To test the potential for radiofrequency fusion of intimal tears, 5 atm of pressure and 200 J radiofrequency energy were delivered from block-mounted bipolar electrodes to 48 segments of human atherosclerotic aorta, which had been manually separated into intima-media and media-adventitial layers. Significantly stronger tissue fusion resulted (28.5 +/- 3.3 g) with radiofrequency compared with that with pressure alone (4.8 +/- 0.26 g; p less than 0.0001). A prototype radiofrequency balloon catheter was used to deliver 3 atm of balloon pressure with or without 200 J radiofrequency energy to 20 postmortem human atherosclerotic arterial segments. In 10 of 10 radiofrequency-treated vessels, thermal \"molding\" of both normal and atherosclerotic vessel wall segments resulted with increased luminal diameter and histologic evidence of medial myocyte damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that postischemic contractile dysfunction of viable myocardium salvaged by reperfusion (\"stunned myocardium\") may be a consequence of abnormal calcium flux within the previously ischemic cells. Calcium channel blocking agents have been shown to enhance contractile function of stunned postischemic tissue, but it is not certain whether these improvements in function are due to the profound hemodynamic and vasodilator effects of these agents or to a direct effect on calcium flux within the stunned myocytes. Therefore, the effects of 1) high doses of nifedipine, given intravenously at 30 min after reperfusion, and 2) minute doses of nifedipine, infused directly into the coronary circulation at 30 min after reflow, were assessed and compared in anesthetized open chest dogs subjected to 15 min of transient coronary artery occlusion. As anticipated, intravenous nifedipine significantly reduced arterial pressure and increased regional myocardial blood flow. In addition, intravenous nifedipine restored systolic contractile function of the stunned, previously ischemic tissue to essentially normal preocclusion values: segment shortening averaged 102 +/- 8% versus 26 +/- 11% of baseline at 2 h after treatment in treated versus control dogs, respectively (p less than 0.003). Low dose intracoronary infusion of nifedipine did not alter hemodynamic variables or myocardial blood flow, but did improve segment shortening (90 +/- 9% versus 37 +/- 10% of preocclusion values at 1 h after treatment versus 25 min after reperfusion [that is, pretreatment], respectively; p less than 0.03). These data indicate that the calcium channel blocking agent nifedipine, given 30 min after reperfusion, enhances systolic contractile function of postischemic stunned myocardium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to assess the relative concentration dependence of beta-blocking and class III actions of sotalol and to relate the findings to concentrations achieved during oral sotalol therapy in humans. Measurements were made in anesthetized dogs under control conditions, and then in the presence of a series of stable sotalol plasma concentrations produced by sequential loading and maintenance infusions. Beta-blocking effects of sotalol, determined by attenuation of the chronotropic actions of isoproterenol, were seen at the lowest dose used. Increases in atrial and ventricular refractory periods (observed in dogs with autonomic blockade to exclude beta-receptor-mediated or reflex autonomic effects) required much larger doses of sotalol. Half-maximal beta-blocking effects occurred at an average sotalol concentration of 0.8 +/- 0.3 mg/liter, an order of magnitude lower than the concentrations required for half-maximal effects on atrial (6.9 +/- 1.2 mg/liter, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (6.8 +/- 2.8 mg/liter, p less than 0.05) refractoriness. These results show that substantially higher concentrations are needed for the class III effects of sotalol than for its beta-blocking action. These pharmacodynamic differences need to be considered in evaluating the antiarrhythmic efficacy and mechanisms of this unusual drug.\r"

There were transient rises in specific IgG1 and IgE during RIT, but the levels of both decreased thereafter. Specific IgG4 increased throughout the follow-up period. The data indicate that the levels of specific IgE and specific IgG1 were correlated with TP cell responses (inducers) and TS cells responses (suppressors) and therefore might be controlled by them; data also suggest that TS cell responses should play a role in the IgG4 response. These changes in TS and TP cell responses and antibody responses have been incorporated into a model of antibody-response regulation by cell-mediated immunity in this type of allergy.\r"

This would help explain why patients with recurrent, unexplained anaphylaxis have an anaphylactic response and, conversely, why patients with systemic mastocytosis can tolerate high levels of plasma histamine. To test this hypothesis, intradermal titrations (0.02 ml of solution from 1 ng/ml to 2 micrograms/ml) of histamine and morphine sulfate (MS) (10 ng/ml to 10 micrograms/ml) were administered to normal volunteers (N = 15), patients with recurrent, unexplained anaphylaxis (N = 10), and patients with systemic mastocytosis (N = 18). Antihistamines were stopped at least 72 hours before the study. Resultant areas of wheal and flare were determined with a computerized morphometric system. Comparison of any two given means at each dose of histamine or morphine with the two-sample Student's t test with Bonferroni inequality demonstrated no significant differences (p greater than 0.05) among the three groups. The median amount of MS or histamine required to produce a half-maximal response was compared for equality. None of the differences observed reached statistical significance, in agreement with the similarity of the dose-response curves. An analysis of the correlation between response to MS and to histamine in individual subjects revealed the responses to be significantly correlated in all cases, with the exception of wheal in patients with recurrent, unexplained anaphylaxis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Prior studies suggest that plicatic and abietic acids are responsible for the asthmatic reactions that occur in cedar-wood and colophony workers; however, the etiologic mechanism(s) of the chronic lung disease is unknown. To determine if plicatic acid from cedar wood and abietic acid from pine resin could directly damage lung cells, we exposed monolayers of rat type II and human A549 alveolar epithelial cells, intact rat lungs, and rat tracheal explants to solutions of plicatic and abietic acids. As indices of injury, we measured lysis of alveolar epithelial cells with a 51Cr technique, quantitative desquamation of epithelial cells from tracheal explants, and histologic alterations in tracheal explants and intact lungs. Plicatic and abietic acids both caused dose- and time-dependent lysis of alveolar epithelial cells. Instillation of plicatic and abietic acids into rat lungs produced bronchial epithelial sloughing. Abietic acid also caused destruction of the alveolar epithelium. The addition of either acid to rat tracheal explants caused epithelial desquamation that was dose- and time-dependent. Our results suggest that plicatic acid, a unique constituent of cedar wood, and abietic acid, the major constituent in pine resin, can produce lytic damage to alveolar, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells. We hypothesize that repeated occupational exposure to these substances might promote the chronic lung damage observed in some cedar- and pine-wood workers and in electronic workers exposed to colophony.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we examined the potential short-term effect of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on total respiratory resistance and forced expiratory volume in patients with nonallergic asthma. A group of nine adult subjects with nonallergic asthma, 55 years of age or older, were exposed to SO2 at 0, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm for 20 minutes at rest followed by 10 minutes during light-moderate exercise. The measures of pulmonary function assessed were FEV1, specific total respiratory resistance (SRT), and maximal expiratory flow rates at 50% (Vmax50) and 75% (Vmax75) of expired vital capacity. Measurements were made before exposure to SO2 (baseline), postresting exposure, postexercising exposure, and at 30 minutes thereafter (recovery). Repeat measure analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant dose-response effect of SO2 inhalation on FEV1 (p = 0.008), SRT (p = 0.033), Vmax50 (p = 0.017), and Vmax75 (p = 0.048). Eight subjects had repeat exposure to SO2 at 1.0 ppm after treatment with either placebo or ipratropium bromide, 60 micrograms by metered-dose inhaler. Inpratropium bromide treatment, compared to placebo treatment, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in all baseline measures of pulmonary function: FEV1 (p = 0.017), SRT (p = 0.027), Vmax50 (p = 0.018), and Vmax75 (p = 0.035). However, this drug did not significantly alter the proportionate change in pulmonary function caused by SO2 inhalation in these subjects. These findings indicate that adults with nonallergic asthma are sensitive to short-term low-level SO2 exposure and that treatment with 60 micrograms of ipratropium bromide causes significant bronchodilation but does not protect, completely, these patients from the effect of SO2 inhalation.\r"

  ".W": "The role played by leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human allergic reactions has been the subject of recent interest and speculation. To characterize further the role of this mediator, we quantitated LTB4 levels in nasal washing by radioimmunoassay in 13 atopic subjects during immediate and late reactions after nasal antigen challenge while the subjects were taking placebo or prednisone (20 mg every 8 hours for 48 hours) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol and compared these levels with levels of seven nonatopic subjects undergoing similar nasal antigen challenge. Nasal antigen challenge of atopic subjects resulted in an increase in LTB4 levels during the immediate reaction in 10 of 13 subjects (9/13 with a greater than 50% increase over baseline) with no similar increase observed in nonatopic subjects (p less than 0.05). An increase in LTB4 levels was observed in 12/13 atopic subjects (6/13 with greater than 50% increase over a second baseline) during late time periods (p less than 0.05), which was associated with an influx of neutrophils (from 65,000 +/- 43,000 to 1,246,000 +/- 829,000; p less than 0.05). However, nonatopic subjects appeared to demonstrate a similar late increase in LTB4 levels. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of immunoreactive LTB4 demonstrated that 84% of immunoreactive LTB4 coeluted with the biologically isomer during the immediate reaction, whereas 44% to 61% coeluted with the biologically active isomer during late reactions. Steroid pretreatment had no effect on either the early or late increase in LTB4 levels or on the neutrophil influx observed during the late reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The Basenji greyhound (BG) has been proposed as a model of atopic disease because of its chronic relapsing atopic dermatitis as well as airway hyperresponsiveness. We attempted to characterize this model further by comparing its skin wheal-and-flare responses to morphine sulfate and histamine with those of control, nonatopic mongrel dogs. We found that BG dogs had significantly smaller skin responses than did the control dogs to all but two concentrations of histamine used. In contrast, BG dogs demonstrated greater skin response to morphine at the three lowest concentrations used but had a significantly smaller skin response at the highest dose of morphine. Skin punch biopsy specimens revealed decreases in histamine content after morphine exposure but no difference in histamine content of the unexposed skin or of morphine-exposed skin for the two groups of dogs. When percent histamine release was compared, however, BG dogs were found to release a significantly greater proportion of histamine in response to morphine than control dogs. Although there was no significant difference in total mast cell counts for the two groups, the BG dogs had significantly fewer formalin-insensitive mast cells in unexposed skin than control dogs. We conclude that skin responses in BG dogs are characterized by decreased end organ responsiveness and greater releasability of mast cells in response to nonimmunologic stimulation.\r"

However, it is not clear whether the increased rosetting is due simply to increase in receptor numbers or whether other factors, such as cell adhesiveness, are involved. We have therefore enumerated granulocyte complement receptors, after asthma provoked experimentally, with monoclonal antibodies against the receptors and flow cytometry. There was a maximal 28.2 +/- 7.5% and 33.4 +/- 9.5% (mean +/- SEM; n = 15) increase in granulocyte CR1 and CR3, respectively, at 3 hours after asthma induced by antigen. There was a maximal 32.0 +/- 7.3% (mean +/- SEM; n = 7) increase in granulocyte CR1, but no change in granulocyte CR3, at 1 hour after exercise-induced asthma. No significant changes in granulocyte CR1 or CR3 were observed up to 6 hours after methacholine challenge, or after exercise in subjects who did not develop exercise-induced asthma. There was a maximal 33 +/- 9% (mean +/- SEM; n = 8) increase in granulocyte CR1 at 30 minutes, but no increase in granulocyte CR3, after histamine challenge of subjects with asthma. Incubation of whole blood with histamine in vitro did not lead to any enhancement in expression of granulocyte CR1. This suggests that antigen- and exercise-induced release of histamine may augment granulocyte CR1 expression through an indirect mechanism. These data indicate that there is increase in the numerical expression of CR1 on granulocytes, after asthma provoked experimentally, which is accompanied by increases in granulocyte CR3 after bronchoprovocation with antigen, but not histamine or exercise.\r"

The patients needed lower turbinectomy because of chronic hypertrophic rhinitis. Tissues of the lower turbinate were obtained at the time of surgery, fragmented, and subsequently challenged with house dust mite in vitro. Diffusates were collected for measurement of neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) and histamine. NCA and histamine were released in a dose-dependent manner, and the time course of release of these mediators was identical. Release of NCA and histamine correlated significantly (p less than 0.001). The prior administration of the antiallergic drugs, disodium cromoglycate or tranilast, significantly blocked the release of NCA and histamine from antigen-challenged tissues. NCA released from nasal tissues eluted as a single peak with estimated molecular size of between 669 kd and 440 kd in three subjects and as two or three peaks in two patients. These results provide evidence that NCA might be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that the neuropeptide, neurokinin A (NKA) (substance K), causes bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma. In a double-blind, crossover study we investigated the effect of nedocromil sodium on NKA-induced bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma. Twelve patients with mild asthma (mean FEV1 percent predicted +/- SE, 87.3 +/- 3.4) inhaled on 2 separate days either nedocromil sodium, 4 mg, or placebo, as two puffs from a metered-dose aerosol, 30 minutes before challenge with NKA. NKA was inhaled at three concentrations (10(-7), 3.10(-7), and 10(-6) mol/ml). The specific airway conductance (SGaw) and FEV1 were measured before and 5 and 15 minutes after each concentration step. On the placebo-treatment day, NKA caused a concentration-dependent decrease in SGaw and FEV1 (mean log for the provocative concentration of NKA causing a 35% fall in SGaw [10(-7) mol/ml], 0.49; mean log for the provocative concentration of NKA causing a 15% fall in SGaw [10(-7) mol/ml], 0.90). The inhalation of 4 mg of nedocromil sodium reduced the decrease in both SGaw and FEV1. The maximal percentage decrease in SGaw on the nedocromil sodium-treatment day was 27 +/- 5.2 (versus placebo, 53.3 +/- 5.4; p less than 0.05), and the maximal percentage decrease in FEV1 was 5.5 +/- 1.4 (versus placebo, 12.4 +/- 2.3; p less than 0.05). The dose-response curves for NKA after nedocromil sodium treatment were significantly shifted to the right compared to the curve after placebo-treatment. We conclude that nedocromil sodium protects against NKA-induced bronchoconstriction in subjects with asthma.\r"

In this study we used rodents to examine the relationship between vascular permeability (VP) and induration during LPR. Efflux of macromolecular tracers from the vasculature into skin was measured with the use of radiolabeled albumin and neutral dextran tracers having large molecular radii. To induce LPR immunologically, we used either intradermal injections of antirat IgE or passive cutaneous sensitization with IgE antidinitrophenyl followed 24 hours later by intravenous injection of albumin-dinitrophenyl. [125I]albumin and [3H]dextran tracers were injected intravenously before and at various intervals after the induction of LPR. Although a marked increase in VP occurred within the first 30 minutes after induction of mast cell degranulation, analysis of radiolabeled tracer accumulation at 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours failed to demonstrate any further increase in VP. These findings indicate that the induration observed in rodent LPR is not associated with increased VP beyond the immediate hypersensitivity stage and suggest that impairment of lymphatic drainage, cellular infiltration, and/or fibrin deposition are contributing factors.\r"

In both patients, long-term prophylaxis with C1 INH had become necessary because treatment with danazol and epsilon-aminocaproic acid was not effective or not tolerated. Consequently, both patients received a pasteurized concentrate of C1 INH continuously for a period of 1 year in a dosage that kept them free of symptoms. The patient with HAE was administered 500 units of C1 INH intravenously every 4 or 5 days, whereas the patient with acquired angioedema required 1000 units of C1 INH every 5 days. As a result of this long-term prophylaxis, both patients became free or nearly free from their episodes of cutaneous and internal edema. The low plasma levels of C1 INH, C4, and C2, rose. In the patient with acquired C1 INH deficiency, the swellings increasingly reappeared after 10 months, although the patient's antibody titer did not rise during treatment. No side effects were recorded during therapy. In particular, both patients remained HIV and hepatitis B antibody negative.\r"

Sensitivity was better with FFSPT for carrot, celery, cherry, apple, tomato, orange, and peach; better with CSPT for peanut, pea, and walnut; and better with RAST for hazelnut. Specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the three tests were determined for apple, carrot, hazelnut, orange, pea, peanut, and tomato. Specificity in the patient groups ranged between 40% (pea) and 100% (apple) for CSPT, between 61% (peanut) and 87% (carrot) for RAST, and between 42% (carrot) and 93% (peanut) for FFSPT. However, all tests were negative in the control group. Thus, false positive results may result from cross-reactivity with pollen allergens. The diagnostic accuracy of these tests in the population with OAS proved comparable for peanut, carrot, hazelnut, and pea. FFSPT proved more sensitive than CSPT or RAST in confirming a history of OAS to certain alimentary allergens, such as apple, orange, tomato, carrot, cherry, celery, and peach.\r"

Platelet activating factor (PAF) accumulated at concentrations of 1 pm to 90 mumol/L in six of eight subjects beginning at 3 hours and continuing for 9 hours after antigen challenge. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) was detectable at cutaneous sites of antigen challenge in five of five subjects throughout the 9-hour period at levels from 1 to 36 nmol, a range of 38% to 80% of which were omega-oxidation metabolites. Histamine levels peaked in the first hour at 106 +/- 18 ng/ml and decreased to a plateau of 11 to 13 ng/ml at 3 to 9 hours after antigen challenge. No PAF and only very low levels of LTB4 (0.1 to 1.3 nmol) and of histamine (less than 2 ng/ml) were detected at buffer-control sites during the 9 hours of study. Continuous antigen exposure thus results in the persistent release of histamine and LTB4 and the late appearance of PAF, all of which may contribute to the chronicity of allergic disorders and may have a bearing on the IgE-mediated, late-phase cutaneous response.\r"

By in vitro activation of Ts3-containing lymph node cells or a pTs3 hybridoma we now show that macrophages are also required for Ts3 activation. In addition, we demonstrate that IJ genetic restrictions control this activation process. Furthermore, we directly demonstrate Ts3 activation using cloned macrophage hybridoma cells. To further investigate the interactions between Ts3 cells and the accessory cells involved in their activation, we attempted to block the second order suppressor factor mediated activation of Ts3 cells with antibodies. The activation of Ts3 cells can be blocked by the addition of anti-IJ, anti-IJ idiotype or anti-NPb idiotype antibodies, but not by anti-CD8, anti-IA, or anti-IE antibodies. Anti-IJ mAb blocked Ts3 activation at the lymphocyte level whereas anti-IJ idiotype blocked activation at the accessory cell level. Finally we tested, whether these antibodies can also directly activate primed Ts3 cells. We demonstrate that cross-linked anti-IJ, anti-NPb and anti-CD3 antibodies can activate Ts3 cells. The results are discussed in terms of receptor-ligand structures on Ts and accessory cells which are required for the activation of Ts3 cells.\r"

The Ag-specific suppressor activity in these hybridoma supernatants was bound by anti-lipomodulin columns and could be recovered by elution at acid pH. Additional evidence for the expression of lipomodulin/GIF activity on these TsF molecules was demonstrated by the ability of the eluted fractions to inhibit the glycosylation of IgE-binding peptides during their biosynthesis. The same biologic activity is associated with GIF and lipomodulin. The relationship between TsF and lipomodulin/GIF was confirmed in a serologic assay, which showed that TsF1 and TsF3 molecules, whether purified over Ag, anti-IJ or anti-TsF columns, are recognized by the mAb. 141-B9. The combined results indicate that Ag-binding Ts factors share a common antigenic determinant with phospholipase inhibitory proteins such as lipomodulin and GIF.

To investigate the influence of the C5 deficiency of SWR in this resistance, crosses were made between SWR and A/J (C5 deficient, TCRwild, H-2a), and between SWR and C3H.A (C5 sufficient, TCRwild, H-2a). Upon immunization with bovine type II collagen in adjuvant, there was a similar incidence and severity of arthritis in H-2q-bearing mice in the back-crosses A x (SWR x A) ad C3H.A x (SWR x C3H.A). The absence of hemolytic complement was confirmed in the arthritic A x (SWR x A) back-cross mice by standard SRBC hemolytic assays. In addition C57L (H-2b) mice, which were C5 sufficient but had a V beta TCR deletion mutation similar to SWR, could not complement for CIA susceptibility in H-2q-bearing C57L x (SWR x C57L) back-crosses and in (C57L x SWR)F2 hybrids. These studies show that complement C5 does not play a significant role in CIA susceptibility, and further implicate the V beta TCR mutation in the resistance to CIA in SWR mice.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils express two types of receptor for the Fc region of IgG, FcRII and FcRIII. Per neutrophil, 10,000 to 20,000 molecules of FcRII (40 kDa) and 100,000 to 200,000 molecules of FcRIII (50 to 80 kDa) are expressed. Via these receptors, neutrophils bind IgG complexes that contain more than one IgG molecule. This binding activates functional processes, such as the respiratory burst and phagocytosis. We studied the contribution of FcRII and FcRIII in the activation of these processes, using well-defined complexes (both large and small) in combination with mAb against FcRII and FcRIII. Small (dimeric) IgG complexes appeared to bind via FcRIII. However, binding to FcRIII alone, when FcRII is blocked by an anti-FcRII mAb, did not induce a respiratory burst. Induction of the respiratory burst by a large immune complex, such as Staphylococcus aureus Wood opsonized with IgG antibodies, was mediated by binding to FcRII, because it was blocked by an anti-FcRII mAb but not by an anti-FcRIII mAb. This indicates that these IgG-opsonized bacteria can cross-link FcRII and activate the cells without the need to adhere to the FcRIII. The respiratory burst induced by IgG-latex was not inhibited by an anti-FcRII mAb, because the avidity for FcRII of IgG-latex, a particle of the same size as a Staphylococcus but with a two to three times higher IgG content, is increased by its simultaneous binding to FcRIII. This enhanced avidity results in removal of anti-FcRII mAb from the FcRII by IgG-latex. This increased avidity of large complexes for FcRII, created by concurrent binding to FcRIII, is not necessary for activation of human neutrophils, because neutrophils from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, with about 10% of the normal FcRIII expression, showed a normal metabolic response upon addition of IgG-latex. Phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized 14C-labeled S. aureus Wood was inhibited equally well by anti-FcRII mAb and by anti-FcRII in combination with anti-FcRIII mAb. Thus, FcRII is not only essential for the IgG-induced activation of the NADPH oxidase system, but also for the IgG-induced phagocytosis.\r"

  ".U": "89176254\r", 
  ".W": "Murine mAb to CD13, CD14, and class II MHC, are able to mobilize calcium in normal human monocytes and enhance superoxide production in primed cells. Antibodies to CD35 (CR1) also cause a minor calcium response in some individuals. Antibodies to CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD15, CD17, CD18, and CD45 do not activate monocytes. The ability of mAb to cause monocyte activation is not only dependent on the Ag with which they react but also on the isotype of the antibodies and the individual from whom the monocytes were obtained. It is shown that this is because the mAb that activate monocytes do so by formation of Ag-antibody-FcR complexes. F(ab')2 fragments of mAb to CD13 and CD14 do not therefore activate monocytes even when cross-linked with F(ab')2 anti-mouse Ig but do so when cross-linked with intact anti-mouse Ig. These data indicate that activation via the FcR requires perturbation of this receptor but does not necessarily require cross-linking of one FcR to another. Antibody-coated particles or cells able to bind to cell surface receptors on monocytes other than the FcR would thus augment FcR-mediated activation.\r"

  ".U": "89176255\r", 
  ".W": "Human C-reactive protein (CRP) is known to activate mouse macrophages (M phi) to a tumoricidal state and to serve as an opsonin for M phi. Therefore, cell surface receptors for CRP on mouse M phi were characterized and their relationship to the IgG FcR determined. The specific binding of 125I-CRP to resident or elicited mouse M phi was saturable, reversible, and involved both a high and a low affinity receptor population. Binding of CRP to the mouse M phi cell lines PU5 1.8 and J774 was nearly identical to that observed with peritoneal M phi. The high affinity receptor population had a calculated K of 10 nM and a receptor density of approximately 10(5) sites per cell. Mouse Ig of the IgG2a, IgG2b, or IgG1 isotypes inhibited binding of 125I-CRP to PU5 1.8 cells at concentrations five-fold greater than that of the homologous ligand. In the converse experiment, unlabeled CRP failed to inhibit specific binding of 125I-labeled IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG1. Isolation of CRP binding proteins from surface iodinated PU5 1.8 cells by ligand-affinity chromatography or chemical cross-linking yielded a major protein band of 57 to 60 kDa which appeared to be distinct from the IgG1/IgG2b FcR (FcR-II) membrane proteins. Removal of radiolabeled IgG2b/IgG1 binding membrane proteins by affinity chromatography did not remove CRP-binding proteins. The rat mAb 2.4G2 which inhibits binding of radiolabeled mouse IgG2b, did not inhibit the binding of CRP. A rat polyclonal antiserum to CRP-binding membrane proteins of PU5 1.8 cells inhibited 125I-CRP binding, but not 125IgG2b binding. The rat polyclonal antibody reacted with two 57 to 60 kDa membrane proteins from PU5 1.8 cells that appear to be of a similar size on Western blots. The 125I-CRP was internalized via endosomes and intact CRP subunits could be detected intracellularly. The findings suggest that binding of CRP occurs through a receptor that is distinct from the IgG FcRs, but that CRP-R activity may be influenced by an association with an IgG FcR.\r"

The mechanism(s) by which eosinophils mediate their effector functions was studied by incubation of human normodense eosinophils with Sepharose beads coupled to various Ig isotypes as targets. Controls included eosinophils incubated alone or incubated with uncoated beads, human serum albumin-, or OVA-coated beads. An eosinophil granule protein, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), was measured as an indicator of eosinophil degranulation. Eosinophils released eosinophil-derived neurotoxin when incubated with Sepharose beads coupled to Ig of the IgG or IgA isotypes, as well as IgA-Fc fragments. Mixtures of IgG and IgA on beads did not act synergistically. Secretory IgA (sIgA) provided the most potent signal for eosinophil degranulation and was two to three times more potent than IgG. Furthermore, 2 to 17% of the normodense eosinophils bound to IgG- or IgA-coated beads, whereas 24 to 27% of the eosinophils bound to sIgA-coated beads. Thus, sIgA may be the principal Ig mediating eosinophil effector function at mucosal surfaces in helminth infections and hypersensitivity diseases, especially bronchial asthma.\r"

  ".U": "89176259\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that the population of mesenteric lymph node cells from normal BALB/c mice infected 14 days with the rodent nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb-MLN) contains a nongranulated mast cell-committed progenitor (MCCP) which does not require IL-3 for proliferation and differentiation if either a fibroblast monolayer or soluble factors produced by monolayers of 3T3 fibroblasts or embryonic skin are present in the culture. When Nb-MLN were cloned in a methylcellulose culture system using fibroblast conditioned medium as the only source of growth factors, numerous colonies of pure mast cells developed. We wished to determine whether the mast cell deficiency of W/Wv or S1/S1d mice could be explained by the failure of these mice to make either the MCCP or the factor to support proliferation and differentiation of the MCCP. We found that Nb-MLN from W/Wv mice were only able to produce mast cell colonies in response to a source of IL-3 such as conditioned medium from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cells (CM), and cultures given fibroblast conditioned medium as the only source of growth factors did not produce mast cell colonies. In contrast, Nb-MLN from mast cell deficient S1/S1d mice developed many mast cell colonies in methylcellulose cultures supplemented with either fibroblast conditioned medium or conditioned medium from PWM-stimulated spleen cells. These data suggest that S1/S1d mice but not W/Wv mice produce the mast cell progenitor that responds to fibroblast conditioned medium. To determine if mast cell deficient mice make the fibroblast derived factors that support development of the MCCP, monolayers were prepared from skin connective tissues of S1/S1d and W/Wv mice and Nb-MLN from normal BALB/c mice were cloned in the presence of conditioned medium from these monolayers. Fibroblast conditioned medium from monolayers prepared from W/Wv but not S1/S1d mice supported development of numerous mast cell colonies. Taken together, these data demonstrate that W/Wv mice are incapable of producing normal MCCP whereas S1/S1d fibroblasts fail to produce the appropriate factor to support the MCCP. In accordance with these data, a candidate for the gene product of each of these mutant alleles is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "89176267\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated the in vitro activation of rat liver macrophages to a tumor-cytotoxic state with muramyl dipeptide (MDP), rough LPS (Re-LPS) and lipid A in both a free and liposome-encapsulated form. The tumor cytotoxic state of the liver macrophages was determined with a [methyl-3H]thymidine release assay using C26 colon adenocarcinoma cells as target cells. As was shown previously, the encapsulation of MDP within multi-lamellar phospholipid vesicles greatly enhanced the activating potency of the drug; by contrast, encapsulation of Re-LPS or lipid A significantly reduced the activation of macrophages as compared to the free form of these agents. At a dose of 1 ng of free Re-LPS per ml a significant induction of tumor cell lysis was observed whereas a maximal level was obtained at a concentration of approximately 10 ng/ml. By encapsulation of Re-LPS in liposomes the activating potency diminished 20- to 100-fold. The minimal concentration required to induce detectable macrophage activation with free lipid A was 10 ng/ml, while liposome-encapsulated lipid A did not induce any detectable tumor cell lysis up to a concentration of 200 ng/ml. After a 1-h pre-incubation with a lysosomal fraction from rat liver at pH 4.8, the macrophage-activating potency of Re-LPS and lipid A was diminished by up to 95% whereas MDP remained fully active under these conditions. We conclude that, due to endocytic uptake of liposome-incorporated Re-LPS and lipid A and subsequent intralysosomal degradation, these immunomodulators are inactivated with respect to their potency to activate liver macrophages to tumor cytotoxicity.\r"

These nonadherent, nonphagocytic macrophage precursor cells are present in the spleen of healthy mice only in a small quantity. However, high numbers of proliferating macrophage precursors are isolated from the spleen of Leishmania donovani-infected mice. Macrophage precursors from spleens of diseased animals are able to kill spontaneously the promastigote as well as the amastigote form of L. donovani. The mechanism of the spontaneous leishmanicidal activity of macrophage precursor cells derived from spleens of L. donovani-infected mice was investigated. This effector function could be defined in part as an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In addition we assessed the role of CSF-1-containing L cell-conditioned supernatant at the leishmanicidal activity of these immature cells of the macrophage lineage. For that purpose, nonadherent spleen cells from healthy mice were cocultivated with this CSF-1-containing medium for 4 days. These in vitro proliferated macrophage precursor cells from untreated mice showed an increased leishmanicidal activity. Thereby we established a further activation mechanism for proliferating splenic macrophage precursor cells responsible for the observed killing of L. donovani pro- and amastigotes. The spontaneous cytotoxicity of macrophage precursors from spleens of L. donovani-diseased animals is thus defined as a cooperative effect of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and Macrophage-CSF activation.\r"

  ".W": "Groups of lactating BALB/c mice were immunized in the immediate postpartum period with high doses of mAb (Ab-1) to the F-glycoprotein (F-gp) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This antibody possessed neutralizing activity against the whole virus. The immune response to F-gp was studied in the breast feeding infant mice of such mothers at regular intervals before and after weaning. All infant mice exhibited anti-F-gp activity in serum, which was detected until 6 wk of age. Splenic cells of such breast feeding infant mice collected after weaning exhibited in vitro synthesis of antibody against Ab-1, the antibody previously used for maternal immunization. Subsequent immunization with homologous purified RSV F-gp resulted in a booster response for IgG, IgM, and plaque-neutralizing antibody to the immunizing RSV protein and to the whole virus in the infants primed via breast feeding. The enhanced antibody response was specific for the antigenic epitopes of the virus protein recognized by the monoclonal antibody used for maternal immunization. Similar booster effect was seen in control infants of nonimmunized mothers who were immunized with a polyclonal Ab-2 prepared by repeated immunization with Ab-1 in DBA/2 mice. These data demonstrate induction of RSV-specific anti-idiotype antibody in the neonates via the process of breast feeding, secondary to maternal immunization after the delivery of the neonate. Use of idiotypic vaccines in the mother and the transfer of RSV-specific idiotypes may offer an alternate approach to the development of effective immunoprophylaxis for RSV infection in early infancy.\r"

NA activity was significantly higher than that observed in PBMC from normal adult donors. Using fractionation on nylon wool and Percoll gradient or C-dependent killing with mAb, it was found that cells of the monocyte-macrophage series and CD4+ T lymphocytes were capable of exerting NA activity in newborns, in contrast with results obtained in adults, where the effector cell was a CD4+ T lymphocyte. The capability of expressing NA activity by CD4+ T lymphocytes from cord blood was also confirmed by flow cytometry sorting. Pretreatment of cord blood mononuclear cells with F(ab')2 fragments against human IgG, but not against human IgA, abrogate the NA activity. Furthermore, human IgA anti-S. typhi cannot arm CD4+ lymphocytes in cord blood. Thus it can be suggested that in newborns, the immune system still being immature, NA activity might be the expression of a mechanism of defence against infections, acting as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity expressed by monocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes armed with preexisting maternal IgG antibodies. This differs from NA activity of adults which is only mediated by CD4+ T lymphocytes armed by IgA.\r"

HTLV-I seroprevalence is 4.2% (43 of 1,012) and is consistent with current estimates in endemic areas in the Caribbean. Age-dependent rise (P less than .01) and higher seroprevalence rates for females (P less than .01) are indistinguishable from the pattern in contemporary Caribbean and Japanese populations. HTLV-I seropositivity was 4 times higher in women (P less than .003) and 2.6 times higher in men (P = .32) with treponemal antibodies, supporting a role for sexual transmission. Children who were positive in a household were more likely to have a seropositive mother than a seropositive father. This pattern is consistent with transmission of the virus from mother to child. Our results document that rates of infection and modes of transmission of HTLV-I are persistent.\r"

Aqueous interferon administered under the same dosing regimen was ineffective. When given at 10(6) units/kg per dose twice daily for 10 d, however, it was highly effective in reducing viremia and rash. The antiviral efficacy obtained with the liposomal IFN-beta formulation given in two injections 5 d apart was thus significantly more efficacious than aqueous IFN-beta given in the same dosing regimen. However, it was not as efficacious as repeated, twice-daily injections of aqueous IFN-beta. Thus, im-injected liposomal IFN-beta, which results in sustained release of the IFN-beta from the injection site, exerts antiviral efficacy in a primate model superior to that obtained with the identical dosing regimen of aqueous IFN-beta.\r"

  ".W": "During a prospective clinical study of melioidosis in northeast Thailand, suppurative parotitis was observed as a characteristic presentation in children. Parotitis constituted 6.3% of all culture-positive melioidosis and 38% of melioidosis in children. Nine cases are described. None had apparent predisposition to infection, although two patients developed rising mumps virus antibody titers, suggesting a possible relation between these conditions. Complications included abscess formation (nine), spontaneous rupture into the auditory canal (five), facial nerve palsy (two), and septicemia and osteomyelitis with septic arthritis (one each). All children initially responded to surgical drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Pseudomonas pseudomallei parotitis should be considered in children from endemic areas with fever and facial swelling. It has a good prognosis with appropriate treatment. It may also prove to be a sensitive clinical indicator of the presence of melioidosis within a particular geographic area.\r"

Serotyping of 74 recurrent pairs of chlamydial isolates from patients attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic indicated that 47.1% (16 of 34) with gonorrhea at the time of recurrence harbored chlamydiae of the same serovar as at the initial infection, while only 22.5% (9 of 40) without gonorrhea had the same serovar (P = .03). The proportion of recurrences by the same serovar in the group without gonorrhea did not differ from the proportion predicted by a random exposure model (22.2% vs. 18.4%, P = .46), while the proportion in the gonorrhea group did (47.1% vs. 19.8%, P less than .0001). The possibility of reinfection did not appear more likely in the group with gonorrhea than in the group without. These observations support the hypothesis that concurrent gonorrhea can reactivate latent chlamydial infection.\r"

Isolates from sporadic infections belonged to eight taxonomic groups and displayed numerous multilocus enzyme genotypes, plasmid profiles, and heavy metal and antibiotic resistance patterns. Compared with 449 noncardiac wound isolates, 45 sporadic cardiac isolates were more likely to be Mycobacterium fortuitum and M. smegmatis and less likely to be M. chelonae. About 80% of cardiac and noncardiac isolates were from southern coastal states. Eight outbreaks of cardiac bypass-related infections were identified. Strains from each outbreak were genotypically distinctive, and five outbreaks involved more than one strain. In two outbreaks, isolates from environmental sources and noncardiac infections were similar or identical to isolates from sternal wound infections. The heterogeneity of these isolates suggests that most isolates are unrelated and are derived from local environmental sources rather than from contaminated commercial surgical materials or devices.\r"

The acute LD50 of amphotericin B-deoxycholate was 5.1 mg/kg versus 20 mg/kg for the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes. Amphotericin B-deoxycholate given iv at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg was more effective in sterilizing liver and kidney than the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes given iv at 1.5-4.5 mg/kg, but infection persisted in the lungs of all rabbits treated with those doses. Infection persisted even when the rabbits were given a lethal dose of amphotericin B-deoxycholate (4.5 mg/kg), but a dose of 15 mg/kg of the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes sterilized tissues and was associated with no acute lethality. Equivalent doses of the amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes were less effective than amphotericin B-deoxycholate, but a fourfold decrease in acute lethality improved the therapeutic index of amphotericin B. The amphotericin/cholesterol-sulfate complexes appear to be an improved means of amphotericin B delivery and may improve therapy for invasive aspergillosis.\r"

This test measures the antigen-binding avidity of toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies.

Patients with primary infection exhibited a low avidity of toxoplasma-specific IgG, which persisted for several months after the onset of symptoms of toxoplasmosis. In contrast, all subjects with past immunity had a high avidity of toxoplasma-IgG. This IgG avidity assay should assist in the diagnosis of acquired toxoplasmosis and may be used to identify pregnancies that are at risk for congenital toxoplasmosis.\r"

Although both the absolute and relative amounts of phosphatidylcholine were elevated in these red cells, the relative distribution of phosphatidylcholine on both sides of the membrane bilayer and the transbilayer mobility of phosphatidylcholine were normal. HPCHA erythrocytes showed elevated absolute amounts per cell of both protein and lipid and an increased cellular ratio of protein to phospholipid. Incubation of normal red cells with DMPC led to the formation of echinocytes, followed by the release of acetylcholinesterase-containing vesicles. Both echinocyte formation and vesiculation were markedly reduced in red cells from patients with HPCHA. Studies with red cells from patients with liver disease, cells that also have elevated relative amounts of membrane phosphatidylcholine and increased amounts of lipid per cell, revealed normal echinocyte formation and normal DMPC-induced vesiculation. We conclude that the altered lipid composition of HPCHA erythrocytes per se is not responsible for the observed reduction in DMPC-induced vesiculation, but that it is more likely the result of a modification in the protein moiety of these cells. This putative protein abnormality could enhance binding of phosphatidylcholine to red cell membranes and could explain the elevated phosphatidylcholine content of HPCHA erythrocytes and their inability to vesiculate.\r"

Cultures were established by using cells isolated by progressive enzymatic dissociation from the extreme outer cortex of the normal human kidney. Cells were subcultured and used at passages 3 through 8. Cell uptake of alpha-methyl-D-glucoside (AMG), inorganic phosphate (Pi) and L-alanine was found to be dependent on the presence of Na+ in the incubation medium, and uptake increased with incubation time up to 30 minutes. Na+-dependent AMG uptake was inhibited 67% by phlorizin (1 mmol/L), and Pi uptake was inhibited 89% by parathyroid hormone (PTH) (10(-6) mol/L). Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate was increased 28-fold after exposure to 10(-6) mol/L PTH but was increased only 2-fold by the same concentration of vasopressin. The cells exhibited endocytotic activity and possessed maltase, leucine aminopeptidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, enzymes located exclusively in the brush border membranes of proximal tubule cells. NHK-C cultures were structurally heterogeneous, made up of a mixed-cell population with predominant epithelial-like morphology. Epithelial cells had cuboidal form, solitary cilia, and short, irregularly distributed apical microvilli. These cultures also formed multicellular hemicysts, but only through passage 3. NHK-C cultures showed a dramatic attenuation of proliferative activity at passages 8 through 10. These data show that subcultured cells derived from the outer cortex of the normal human kidney retain a number of functional characteristics typical of the proximal tubule.\r"

Using an ex vitro isolated, perfused rabbit lung and a cultured porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayer (ENDO) as models, we asked whether neutrophil cathepsin G could decrease the barrier properties of the intact vasculature and cultured endothelial monolayers. After the addition of cathepsin G (10 micrograms/ml) to the perfusate of the isolated, perfused lung, there was a fourfold increase in net weight gain after a venous pressure challenge (p less than 0.01). The addition of cathepsin G to a cultured ENDO directly increased the movement of albumin across the monolayers in a dose-dependent fashion (10 micrograms/ml led to a 59% +/- 5% increase, 15 micrograms/ml to a 135% +/- 55% increase, 20 micrograms/ml to a 247% +/- 78% increase, and 30 micrograms/ml to a 381% +/- 89% increase, p less than 0.05 at all concentrations). Heat-inactivation of the enzyme only partially protected the ENDO, but exposure in the presence of either the polyanion heparin or the polyanion dextran sulfate completely protected the ENDO. Normal human serum also protected the ENDO, but serum from two patients with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) deficiency was only partially protective. The protection afforded by human serum was time dependent, because addition of the serum 5 or 15 minutes after the addition of cathepsin G offered no protection. Oxidation of alpha 1-PI, as may occur at sites of inflammation, also destroyed its protective effect. Cytotoxic injury of the porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayer by cathepsin G, which was also prevented by the polyanions, only partially explained these results, because cathepsin G increased albumin transfer across the ENDO at concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml, which were minimally cytolytic to the ENDO. Additionally, cathepsin G caused cell retraction, with the development of intercellular gaps visible on light microscopy of the ENDO. This effect was also prevented by the polyanions. These results demonstrate that cathepsin G has direct effects on a cultured ENDO that may be caused by the charge or charged site(s) on cathepsin G.\r"

  ".W": "Although there is considerable evidence that vasodilator prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) modulate renal hemodynamics in liver cirrhosis, the role of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is controversial. We measured renal hemodynamics and glomerular eicosanoid production in cirrhotic and control rats. Renal plasma flow, as estimated by para-aminohippurate clearance (CPAH) and glomerular filtration rate, as determined by inulin clearance (CIN), were comparable between groups; glomerular production of PGE2 and TXA2 (estimated by the metabolite thromboxane B2 [TXB2]) was slightly but not significantly higher in cirrhotic than in control rats (PGE2: 1060 +/- 142 pg/mg glomerular protein vs 854 +/- 288 pg/mg glomerular protein; TXB2: 782 +/- 103 pg/mg glomerular protein vs 468 +/- 104 pg/mg glomerular protein). Addition of serum from cirrhotic rats to the incubation media failed to increase eicosanoid production in glomeruli obtained from either cirrhotic or control rats. Cyclooxygenase inhibition with 5 mg/kg indomethacin, a dose sufficient to result in a 68% inhibition of glomerular PGE2 synthesis, decreased both CPAH (from 6.59 +/- 0.69 ml/min to 4.52 +/- 0.67 ml/min, p less than 0.05) and CIN (from 1.34 +/- 0.16 ml/min to 0.68 +/- 0.07 ml/min, p less than 0.01) in cirrhotic rats. Thromboxane synthesis inhibition with 1 mg/kg UK-38485, which resulted in an 84% decrease in glomerular TXB2, did not significantly affect either CPAH or CIN; however, there was a strong trend toward improvement in CIN (from 1.23 +/- 0.11 ml/min to 1.43 +/- 0.15 ml/min (0.05 less than p less than 0.1). Neither drug affected renal hemodynamics in control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a model of endotoxemic acute renal failure in the anesthetized male rat in which acute endotoxin infusion induces renal vasoconstriction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the absence of systemic hypotension. Because increased levels of platelet activating factor (PAF) have been observed in experimental models of endotoxemia, we pretreated rats with PAF receptor antagonist BN 52021 or SRI 63-675 before administering endotoxin. Compared with treatment with vehicle, treatment with BN 52021 led to significant preservation of RBF, GFR, and urine flow rate. Pretreatment with SRI 63-675 resulted in significant improvement in RBF while completely preventing the fall in GFR and urine flow rate. Intrarenal artery infusion of exogenous PAF (30 ng/kg/min) resulted in renal vasoconstriction, decreased GFR, and oliguria. These effects were also prevented by pretreatment with SRI 63-675. Thus, the adverse renal hemodynamic effects of endotoxemia were blunted or prevented by pretreatment with PAF receptor antagonists. We conclude that endogenously produced PAF is an important mediator of endotoxemic acute renal failure.\r"

With cholesterol less than 200 mg/dl, misclassification was arbitrarily identified by an LDL level greater than or equal to the 75th percentile, a triglyceride level greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, or an HDL level less than or equal to the 10th percentile. With the cholesterol level in the 200 to 239 mg/dl range, misclassification was identified by an LDL level greater than or equal to the 75th percentile, a triglyceride level greater than or equal to the 90th percentile, and an HDL level less than or equal to the 10th percentile or greater than or equal to the 90th percentile (or both). With a cholesterol level greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl, misclassification was identified by an HDL level less than or equal to the 10th percentile, or greater than or equal to the 90th percentile. With the cholesterol level less than 200 mg/dl, misclassification is rare, occurring in 14.5% of the subjects. With the cholesterol level in the 200 to 239 mg/dl range, and greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl, misclassification occurred in 46.7% and 17.6% of the subjects, respectively. The importance of routine lipoprotein analysis when the cholesterol level is greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl is emphasized by the finding that 65% of the subjects in this category had top quartile LDL levels, 8% had bottom decile HDL levels, and 30% had top decile triglyceride levels. To avoid misclassification, fasting HDL, LDL, and triglyceride levels should probably be measured in all subjects with screening cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 200. There is remarkably little misclassification with top quartile LDL or bottom decile HDL levels (or both) when the cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dl.\r"

Molecular analysis of MM.1 demonstrates that it is negative for the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus genome. Southern analysis of MM.1 detected a rearrangement of the lambda-light chain gene, and Northern analysis revealed high levels of lambda gene expression. Cytogenetic analysis of the MM.1 cell line revealed the presence of seven related chromosomally abnormal cell lines characterized by numerical and structural aberrations, and it revealed five nonclonal abnormal cells. The most notable abnormality is a reciprocal translocation involving band q24.3 of chromosome 12 and band q32.3 of chromosome 14; translocations involving 14q32 are frequently observed in neoplasms of B cell origin.\r"

After the injection of iron 59-labeled ferritin, hemoglobin, or human asialotransferrin, the proportions of the radioactive iron returned to the plasma and incorporated into stores were determined under various conditions. Iron 55-labeled rat transferrin was injected at the same time as the 59Fe-labeled compound, and storage iron release was calculated from the cumulative incorporation of the two isotopes in the red cell mass over 2 weeks. The various 59Fe-labeled compounds were processed differently by the hepatocyte, but the radioactive iron was incorporated in the same iron stores. About 6% of the hepatocyte storage iron was released daily in normal rats, but a pool of iron that is not mobilized spontaneously was clearly identified in iron overload. Iron turnover in the hepatocyte was regulated by the rate of erythropoiesis and iron status of the animal, and inflammation blocked hepatocyte iron release. A strong correlation between hepatocyte iron release and plasma transferrin receptor levels was observed (p less than 0.001), suggesting that plasma transferrin receptors could mediate the regulation of hepatocyte iron mobilization in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in postischemic renal injury. However, the source of these oxygen free radicals has not been well defined. One potential source is activated neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion was produced in rats by using two different techniques, and the effect on ischemic injury was examined. Rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with a Percoll gradient centrifugation-purified (approximately 90%) suspension of rat neutrophils. Rats received antineutrophil serum in one of four protocols and were subsequently subjected to 40 minutes of renal artery occlusion. Control animals received nonimmune rabbit serum. The serum creatinine levels 24 hours after ischemia were not different between control and immune serum-treated rats in any of the protocols despite significant reductions in absolute neutrophil count. In a separate study, nitrogen mustard was administered 40 hours before ischemia. Nitrogen mustard-treated rats developed moderate neutropenia and 24 hours after ischemia had lower serum creatinine levels and higher inulin clearance. However, nitrogen mustard-treated rats lost 31.5 +/- 5 gm body weight in the 2 days after nitrogen mustard administration, whereas control animals gained 5.9 +/- 5.9 gm during the same interval. Furthermore, among nitrogen mustard-treated rats there was no correlation between neutrophil count and postischemic renal function. It is thus possible that the beneficial effects of nitrogen mustard were caused by a mechanism other than neutrophil depletion. In summary, in four protocols that used antineutrophil serum, neutropenia did not protect against ischemic injury. Nitrogen mustard provided protection, but probably by a neutrophil-independent mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The glycocalyx was evident over the whole apical surface of both sensory and supporting cells. The entire length of the stereocilia of both inner and outer hair cells was seen to be covered by a glycocalyx, which interconnected the neighbouring stereocilia. In the gentamicin-treated animals, the fusion process between the stereocilia was revealed and a decrease of the glycocalyx was noticed at the point where fusion started. These findings suggest that the glycocalyx may play an important role in holding the stereocilia together in a bundle, yet prevent their close contact by means of its strong negative charge.\r"

A thorough analysis of these compounds in the gerbilline ES was carried out using both transmission electron microscopic (TEM) histochemistry, using dialyzed iron and periodic acid--chromic--silver staining techniques, as well as immunoflourescence with fluorescein-labelled lectins (FITC-lectins). N-acetylglucosamine was found to be one of the major carbohydrate components both of the epithelial layer of the ES and of the luminal precipitate. Proofs for a local secretory activity and its intracellular pathway are presented, suggesting to be involved in the regulation of pressure and volume of inner ear fluids.\r"

The actuarial tables showed a 50 per cent cumulative success rate for canal-up procedures versus a 90 per cent rate for canal-down operations. The successful canal-up procedures, however, demonstrated slightly better hearing results. These success rates seemed to be comparable to those using planned staged surgery. It was concluded that if single stage canal-up procedures were used with larger mastoids and canal-down procedures with smaller mastoids, 80 per cent of patients could be controlled without either residual or recurrent disease appearing. For the others, it was felt safe to wait for the disease to reappear rather than to do planned two-stage procedures for all patients. It was further urged that actuarial statistics be employed when reporting the results of surgery for cholesteatoma.\r"

Tensa retraction cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the whole pars tensa, whereas sinus cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the postero-superior part of the tensa. We present the long-term results obtained in tensa retraction cholesteatomas treated with one stage surgery from 1964 to 1980. Median observation time was 9 years, range 2 to 19 years. Sixty-one ears were treated without mastoidectomy, whereas 71 ears had canal wall-up mastoidectomy and 64 ears had canal wall-down mastoidectomy. The total recurrence rate was 13.3 per cent; 17 ears had residual cholesteatoma, and nine ears had recurrent cholesteatoma. The best results were obtained in ears with an intact ossicular chain where mastoidectomy was not performed. In 49 per cent of the cases, the cholesteatoma was confined to the tympanic cavity without reaching the aditus, antrum or mastoid process. About one-third to one-quarter of the ears had tympanoplasty only, with removal of the cholesteatoma through the ear canal.\r"

Twenty-five swabs were collected from patients suffering from Rhinosporidiosis and cultured in standard media. Positive results were obtained in 23 cases. The conidia produced from the colony were compared with the structures obtained from the patient material. Light microscopy using histopathological techniques were used. The consistent appearance of the organism in patient material, the repeatability of growth in subcultures and the negative growth in controls indicated that the organism grown in culture is the causative agent of the disease. The effect of parameters like pH, temperatures, etc, were also studied.\r"

Benign tumours were 378; primary and metastatic malignant tumours--100; non tumoral lesions--104. The benign tumours follow-up showed three recurrences only (two pleomorphic adenomas--one of them proved to be an adenoid-cystic carcinoma, and one monomorphic adenoma, which also proved to be an adenoid-cystic carcinoma), respectively 6, 6 and 8 years later. The malignant tumours were also treated by total parotidectomy with adequate management both of the facial nerve and the neck lymph nodes. The results thoroughly justify the nerve preservation, when preserved.\r"

This negative partial correlation was much stronger when the analysis was limited to subjects with total cholesterol greater than 5.20 mmol/L (200 mg/dL, r = -.51, P = .006). Subjects at high risk for atherosclerosis with total cholesterol greater than 7.25 mmol/L (280 mg/dL) have a glycosylated hemoglobin (6.32 percent) that is in the range of well-controlled diabetics. Subjects with moderately elevated cholesterol have moderately elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (5.92 percent) compared with normocholesterolemic subjects (5.53 percent). These results support the hypothesis that elevated blood glucose that is associated with hypercholesterolemia is responsible for some of the atherogenesis associated with high cholesterol levels.\r"

A randomized experimental study involving 24 private physicians and 109 pregnant smokers was conducted comparing the American Lung Association's Because You Love Your Baby smoking intervention (ALA) to a standard-of-care protocol (non-ALA). The non-ALA protocol was based upon the smoking interventions that study physicians said they commonly used among pregnant women. Self-reported smoking rates were obtained by questionnaire at the first prenatal visit, at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation, and at the six-week postpartum visit. By the time of the first prenatal visit, both groups reduced by half the number of cigarettes smoked. By 32 to 36 weeks, the groups decreased the daily average by an additional 2.3 (ALA) and 1.8 (non-ALA) cigarettes, a nonsignificant difference between the groups. Fifteen (28 percent) of the ALA group compared with 9 (16 percent) of the non-ALA group reported quitting at the 32- to 36-week visit (P = .10). Only 9 percent of the ALA group and 10 percent of the non-ALA were nonsmokers at the postpartum visit. Pregnancy alone is a powerful motivator for women to decrease their smoking. Although the difference between the ALA and non-ALA protocols did not attain statistical significance, the percentage of those who quit was comparable to the results obtained in other controlled trials. The ALA Because You Love Your Baby protocol should be used until more effective methods are available.\r"

The survey response rate was 60.4 percent. Almost 20 percent of all respondents reported that they have never provided obstetric care of any type. Another 40 percent have provided obstetric care previously but have now discontinued this care, while the remaining 40 percent currently offer obstetric care to their patients. The proportion of respondents who discontinued the practice of obstetrics because of increased risk of malpractice litigation increased significantly over the years from 1947 to 1986 (P = .0084). The proportion of respondents who discontinued obstetric practice because of increased malpractice insurance costs also increased significantly from 1945 to 1986 (P = .0002). The proportion of those entering practice during the past five years who decided not to offer obstetric services because of malpractice risks was significantly greater than the proportion entering practice earlier (21.0 percent vs 2.0 percent, P = .0090). Although the current patterns of obstetric practice showed regional variation, the accelerating impact of malpractice risk and insurance cost on these patterns was similar throughout the nation.\r"

  ".W": "This paper examines the spontaneous evolution of original work in family practice as published in The Journal of Family Practice over the 15-year period since it began publication in 1974. An analysis was carried out by principal content and type of paper for the last five years in a manner comparable to an earlier analysis of the journal's first ten years of publication. Trends that emerge from this reanalysis provide a window to observe the further development of family medicine as a scientific and academic discipline. The last five years have seen a marked increase in clinical content of papers (from approximately 60 to 80 percent of published papers) together with continued emphasis on health services subjects. There has been a concurrent sharp increase in research papers, continued strong representation of case studies, and some decrease in both reviews and methods papers. Descriptive research continues to predominate among research papers. Although experimental research still represents only 5 percent of published papers, this percentage has more than doubled over the last five years. The reanalysis also revealed a substantial decline in the proportion of educational papers, as other journals in the field have assumed the primary role for this content area. It appears that the manuscript supply represented by original work in the field is still limited and that there is at present adequate or even surplus journal capacity for publication of work carried out in family practice settings. The quality and type of work continue to mature consistent with the needs of family medicine as a scientific and academic discipline.\r"

It is limited by the nature of the lesion, which must be easily palpable, the physician's technical ability, and the availability of a reference cytopathologist. Complications are rare and usually very benign, such as local hematoma. With proper training and understanding of the procedure, many family physicians could easily introduce the procedure into their office practice.\r"

Prevalence of cerebrovascular risk factors was similar in patients with TGA and TIA, but significantly lower in the third group. CT showed more hypodense lesions in TIA patients than in those with TGA. In a mean follow-up of 36 months, five TGA patients experienced a TIA and three others had recurrence of TGA, but none suffered stroke or myocardial infarction. In the TIA group, four had recurrence of TIA, two suffered a stroke and two others a myocardial infarction, whereas none had TGA attacks. None of the patients of the third group had any ischaemic event during follow-up. The similar prevalence of risk factors, but the different prognosis between TGA and TIA patients, suggest that TGA is an ischaemic event, probably not triggered by thromboembolism but by a different, possibly vasospastic, mechanism.\r"

Clinical disability was assessed by Hoehn and Yahr scale, Northwestern University Disability Scale and Websterscore. All patients were on levodopa substitution therapy and used anticholinergics. Pulmonary function was investigated by spirography, determination of a maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curve and, when possible, maximal static mouth pressures were determined. Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow, maximal expiratory flow at 50% and maximal static mouth pressures were significantly below normal values. Vital capacity, forced inspiratory volume in 1 s and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and vital capacity were relatively normal. Nine patients had upper airway obstruction (UAO) as judged by abnormal values for peak inspiratory flow, the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and peak expiratory flow and the ratio of maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow at 50%. Flow-volume curves were normal in eight patients; four patients demonstrated flow decelerations and accelerations (type A) and 16 had a rounded off flow-volume curve (type B). Type A can be explained by UAO and type B by a combination of decreased effective muscle strength and possible UAO. Overall results of pulmonary function tests in patients without any clinical signs or symptoms of pulmonary disease point to subclinical upper airway obstruction and decreased effective muscle strength in a significant proportion of patients.\r"

Performances of control subjects on a wide range of tests exploring mnesic, visuo-constructive, linguistic and general intellectual functions (n = 21) did not differ from analogous performances of Parkinsonians without signs of diffuse mental deterioration. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was then used to verify the hypothesis that a selective impairment of cognitive functions subsumed by the integrity of frontal lobes could be demonstrated in Parkinsonian patients. Our results provide evidence that in this task, defective performances are obtained by Parkinsonians and even by patients without signs of diffuse cognitive impairment. These findings seem to confirm that a deficit in concept formation, maintenance and shifting is largely independent of the dementia frequently noticed in Parkinson's disease.\r"

The striking similarity between the pattern of contrast sensitivity loss in drug-induced Parkinsonism and that in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, suggests that generalised dopaminergic deficiency, from whatever cause, affects visual function in an analogous way.\r"

Ischaemic damage was found in the brains of 92% of the 1968-72 cases and in 88% of the 1981-82 cases: there was no statistical difference in the amount of moderately severe and severe ischaemic damage in the two groups, 55% and 54% respectively. There was evidence, however, that an increased number of patients with severe ischaemic brain damage was admitted in 1981-82 as a result of a changed admission policy of the Department of Neurosurgery that resulted in an increased detection of intracranial haematomas. It is concluded that ischaemic brain damage is still common after severe head injury, and it seems likely that it remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity.\r"

The findings compared with normal volunteers seem to demonstrate that, during ILS, (1) in non lesional patients, the suspected epileptic focus shows a significant rCBF increase (2) in lesional patients, the significant rCBF increases were not in the region of the suspected epileptic focus but in adjacent or in contralateral ones.

In those who recovered from hypoglycaemic coma, CSF lactate was markedly elevated to 2.45-4.43 m mol/l. CSF glucose concentrations, however, were substantially the same between treated hypoglycaemic and diabetes mellitus groups. These findings indicate that CSF lactate levels increase with glycaemic levels in diabetes mellitus owing to enhanced glucose influx into glycolytic pathway of the brain, and also increases in treated hypoglycaemic coma probably due to mitochondrial dysfunction or damage.\r"

The amount of postural sway seen while wearing the device at rest is intermediate between the \"normal vision\" and \"eyes closed\" conditions, and increases with increasing amounts of RIS. However, when large active head-and-eye movements are performed, postural sway is dramatically increased when using RIS, and is then worse than while performing the same task in the \"eyes closed\" condition. It is concluded that patients who use the partial-RIS device for the treatment of severe oscillopsia may benefit only when performing tasks in which the head is relatively still, such as reading, writing or watching TV. It is also proposed that the partial-RIS device can serve as a model in normal free-standing subjects for the postural effects of oculomotor disorders.\r"

This axonal dissolution was much less manifest above the ponto-medullary junction. Large pyramidal cells of Betz were not identified in the precentral gyrus, suggesting that the parental soma of the damaged axons had undergone atrophic changes. Furthermore, the involvement of the so-called aberrant pyramidal tract in the pontine medial lemniscus indicated that retrograde degeneration had occurred there as well.\r"

In nine of the patients tremor was not clinically obvious. When the tremor of these patients was recorded immediately after voluntary movement and subjected to instrumental analysis there were consistently observable differences from the controls. Such analysis may have diagnostic potential when there is clinical uncertainty. Surface EMG recordings were obtained from four patients. One patient had a large resting tremor with obvious reciprocating activity in flexors and extensors; in the others who had no symptomatic tremor there was reciprocating activity only after movement, and this died away in a few seconds as the induced tremor disappeared.\r"

  ".W": "Classical beliefs about the functions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord have been attacked following recent evidence that position and vibration sensations may be carried in the dorsal spinocerebellar tracts. There is evidence that the one specific function of the dorsal columns is for the transmission of information concerning the direction of tactile cutaneous movement. Thirty normal controls, 43 patients with spinal cord disorders and 10 patients with functional disorders were examined prospectively using an easily administered \"direction of scratch\" protocol. Interpretation of the direction of a 2 cm vertical tactile cutaneous movement over the lower limbs was found to be accurate in normal controls and grossly inaccurate in patients with functional disorders, exceeding the error rate of guessing. Detection of direction of 2 cm scratch was moderately impaired in 11 of 13 patients with spastic paraparesis and preserved sensation to all other modalities and 23 of 24 patients with spastic paraparesis and impaired proprioception and/or vibration sensations. Direction of 2 cm scratch, proprioception and vibration sensations were preserved in the three cases with anterior spinal cord syndromes. It is proposed that tactile perception of direction of 2 cm scratch over the lower limbs is a sensitive sign of posterior column function which can be usefully incorporated into the clinical sensory examination in the evaluation of spinal cord disorders.\r"

Simple RT and choice RT were tested in separate blocks, and the benefit afforded by advance information in the simple RT condition (choice RT minus simple RT) served as a measure of motor preparation. RT was longer in the \"bad\" hand in both the simple RT and choice RT conditions. There was no difference in the effect of advance information between the two hands. It is concluded that slowness in RT movement initiation in Parkinson's disease is not due to a deficiency in motor preparation, and that intact basal ganglia function is not required for this stage of motor programming.\r"

We used the pulse-detecting capability of the pulse oximeter to assess the presence of collateral circulation of the hand. Thirty-one patients undergoing radial artery cannulation for intraoperative monitoring were evaluated before cannulation with a modified Allen's test and by pulse oximetry. After the collateral circulation of the hand was tested by the modified Allen's test, a pulse oximeter probe was placed on the index finger. Both radial and ulnar arteries were occluded until no perfusion was detected by the pulse oximeter. The test was repeated twice on each hand, once for each artery. The time to reperfusion after arterial release was recorded. Reperfusion times greater than 15 seconds were considered abnormal. This sequence was repeated postoperatively after the radial artery cannulae were removed. A total of 68 tests were performed before cannulation; 3 showed an abnormal Allen's test, a finding confirmed by pulse oximetry evaluation. The Allen's test was indeterminate 13 times. In all of these cases, pulse oximetry demonstrated collateral blood flow. When collateral circulation was determined to be present by Allen's test, it was also found to be present with pulse oximetry. Three days after cannulation was discontinued, 8 patients had abnormal Allen's test results, a finding again confirmed by pulse oximetry evaluation. Of 15 patients with indeterminate Allen's test results, 12 had collateral blood flow determined by pulse oximetry and 3 had abnormal results. The ability of pulse oximetry to detect collateral circulation was significantly different (P less than 0.001) when compared with Allen's test both before and after radial artery cannulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Yet this difference between the interval recommended and that actually used indicates that sampling intervals are not defined clearly enough. Therefore, we present three methods with which to determine sampling intervals during monitoring. To explore the feasibility of these methods we examined data gathered every 7.5 seconds during three typical, noncatastrophic physiologic perturbations induced in an anesthetized dog. We chose hypercapnia secondary to rebreathing, hypotension secondary to deep anesthesia, and hypoxemia secondary to a low concentration of inspired oxygen as realistic examples of what can occur during operation and anesthesia. We studied three variables: respired carbon dioxide, femoral arterial blood pressure, and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (pulse oximeter). The data obtained during monitoring were subjected to three methods of analysis: (1) recording of sets of data, with various starting times, at five-minute intervals only (moving grid); (2) Fourier analysis; and (3) analysis of slopes. For the data of the experiment, the Fourier analysis yielded, on average, longer sampling intervals than did the analysis of slopes.\r"

The EEG was processed by means of aperiodic analysis. The pacemaker generated an artifact that was identified on the processed EEG display and on the raw EEG display. During the time of carotid cross-clamping, a loss of EEG activity was noted on careful examination of the processed EEG and confirmed by referring to the raw EEG. Nevertheless, because of the presence of the artifact, the activity edge remained essentially constant despite the change in underlying EEG activity. The cross-clamp was released based on the observed change in EEG activity, yielding a return to baseline EEG activity. The surgeon elected to shunt the patient. The patient awoke without neurologic sequelae. This case serves to demonstrate the importance of referring to the raw EEG signal and the limitations of the activity edge in the presence of artifact.\r"

An automated computer-controlled system was used to collect muscle contraction force waveforms and to analyze contraction waveforms for comparison of variables before and after drug administration. Two concentrations of halothane (0.5 and 1.5%) were administered to the atrial preparation for 30 minutes and followed by calcium chloride or magnesium sulfate. Six variables (latency, time to peak tension, peak tension, maximum rate of change of pressure, force time integral, and relaxation time) were automatically determined from averaged stimulus-response curves. Results were normalized and compared with controls administered only calcium and magnesium and with controls administered no drugs. The automated system greatly simplified data collection and accumulation and statistical analysis of multiple responses. The system made possible averaging and analysis of more data with less variability than is normally obtained with manual systems. The results confirm several known actions of these agents. Halothane prolongs latency (9 and 21% for 0.5 and 1.5% halothane, respectively) and shortens time to peak tension (6 and 17% for 0.5 and 1.5% halothane, respectively) and relaxation time (17 and 39% for 0.5 and 1.5% halothane, respectively). At high halothane concentrations (1.5%) calcium chloride shortens latency (10%) and prolongs time to peak tension (11%); magnesium sulfate prolongs latency (14%) and shortens time to peak tension (10%).\r"

  ".U": "89177422\r", 
  ".W": "The B-cell neoplasms, multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, frequently become drug resistant, despite initial responses to chemotherapeutic drugs. Tumor cells from eight patients with clinically drug-refractory disease were evaluated by immuno-histochemical staining for monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) expression, nuclear proliferation antigen, P-glycoprotein (P-gly) expression, and other cellular antigens. P-gly was detected on tumor cells from six of eight patients with drug-resistant disease. Of the six patients with P-gly-positive tumors, five patients had advanced multiple myeloma and one had a drug-refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cellular RNA analysis confirmed the over-expression of P-gly. In an effort to overcome drug resistance, a pilot study evaluated possible verapamil enhancement of chemotherapy in these eight patients. All patients had developed progressive disease while receiving a regimen containing vincristine and doxorubicin, and seven of eight patients had previously received continuous infusion vincristine and doxorubicin plus oral dexamethasone (VAD). At the time of progressive disease, continuous infusion verapamil was added to the VAD regimen. Three of the eight patients who were refractory to vincristine and doxorubicin alone responded when verapamil was added to VAD. The three patients who responded had P-gly-positive tumors. Verapamil increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and vincristine in vitro for both a P-gly-positive myeloma cell line and tumor cells from two patients with end-stage myeloma which over-expressed P-gly. The dose-limiting side effect associated with the addition of verapamil to chemotherapy was temporary impairment of cardiac function, manifest as hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. We conclude that P-gly expression occurs in drug-refractory B-cell neoplasms and may contribute to the development of clinical drug resistance. However, other factors, such as the proliferative activity of the tumor, may also play a role in determining response to chemotherapy. The administration of verapamil along with VAD chemotherapy may partially circumvent drug resistance in patients whose tumors over-express P-gly.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred seventy-nine patients with advanced measurable colorectal cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy were entered into a prospective randomized clinical trial by the Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program (MAOP) to compare two schedules of delivery for single-agent fluorouracil (5-FU). The \"standard\" treatment was a schedule commonly employed in clinical practice, namely, a daily bolus dose administered intravenously (IV) for five consecutive days and repeated at 5-week intervals. The investigational treatment was a continuous infusion of 5-FU administered 24 hours a day for a protracted time (10 weeks or more). Both treatments were continued until the development of disease progression or unless interrupted for toxicity. Using stringent objective criteria requiring independent confirmation of x-ray or scan-documented response, the tumor response rate reached 7% (six of 87) for the bolus arm and 30% (26 of 87) for the infusion arms (P less than .001). Toxicity was substantially different for the two arms with major leukopenia observed only on the bolus arm, 22% developing grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (life-threatening) leukopenia with four sepsis-related deaths. Hand-foot syndrome was observed only in the infusional arm, requiring treatment interruptions and dose reductions in 24% of patients, but with little impact on quality of life. In spite of the major difference in objective response rate, overall survival for the two groups was comparable. Administration of 5-FU as a continuous infusion for protracted periods clearly improves the therapeutic index for this agent in patients with advanced colon cancer with respect to response rate and reduced toxicity. This schedule appears workable in the community setting and yields response rates similar to those reported for 5-FU with high-dose leucovorin, but without the gastroin testinal toxicity profile of the latter combination.\r"

  ".W": "Using an immunocytochemical technique, micrometastases have been found in the bone marrow of approximately 26% of patients with primary breast cancer at the time of initial surgery. To determine the fate of these cells, both in patients receiving and not receiving adjuvant therapy, multiple bone marrow aspirates were repeated in 82 patients at a median time of 18 months after surgery but prior to overt relapse. In both treated and untreated patients micrometastases were only found in one of 45 (2%) and one of 37 (3%) patients, respectively. However, when multiple marrow aspirates were taken from patients with local recurrence the incidence of micrometastases was 19% (three of 16), and this increased to 30% (three of ten) in patients with disease at distant sites other than bone, and 100% (ten of ten) in patients with radiologically proven bony disease. Three of 11 (27%) patients in whom the primary tumor remained in situ while receiving adjuvant therapy before definitive surgery had micrometastases at the time of diagnosis and at follow-up 3 months later. These results suggest that many of the micrometastases from breast cancer patients are the result of \"shedding\" of cells from the primary carcinoma and that a proportion are not viable. The technique is currently insufficiently sensitive to accurately monitor adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients.\r"

There were 349 evaluable patients, of whom 176 received CP while 173 patients received CP plus doxorubicin (CAP). Hematologic toxicity was almost identical. There was no significant difference in progression-free interval (PFI) (median, 22.7 months and 24.6 months), frequency of negative second-look laparotomy (30.2% and 32.8%), or survival (median, 31.2 months and 38.9 months) between CP and CAP, respectively. Thus, doxorubicin in the dose schedule employed does not improve combination chemotherapy of optimal stage III ovarian carcinoma. Several other findings, independent of treatment arm, were of interest. There was a significant difference in PFI and survival by residual disease category (yes v no) and by grade of differentiation (1 v 2 + 3). In multivariate analysis, age, residual disease at entry, cell type (clear cell carcinoma), and time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy were significant predictors of survival. There was no difference in outcome comparing those who refused second-look with those who had a second-look.\r"

Major problems with dialysate inflow and egress occurred in ten patients and required discontinuation of therapy. An additional ten patients experienced hematologic toxicity with a median nadir WBC of 2,300/microL. Therapy was altered but not discontinued because of this complication. Other adverse sequelae, such as abdominal pain, were manageable with medication. IP 5-FU is technically feasible on a multiinstitutional basis in residual ovarian cancer, but its therapeutic role remains to be defined.\r"

This compound is known to inhibit the binding of growth factors (eg, epidermal growth factor [EGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], tumor growth factor-beta [TGF-beta]) to their receptors and thus antagonize the ability of these factors to stimulate growth of tumor cells in vitro. There were no complete responses (CRs), four partial responses (PRs) (two of ten adrenal cortex, one of four renal, one of one adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma [HTLV-1]), and two minimal responses (MRs) (two of ten adrenal cortex). Toxicity included proteinuria (14 patients), reversible liver function test abnormalities (eight), vortex keratopathy (five), adrenal insufficiency (three), coagulopathy secondary to increased circulating levels of glycosaminoglycans (11), and one case of a reversible acute demyelinating polyneuropathy resembling the Guillain-Barre syndrome. We conclude that suramin is an active agent in the treatment of metastatic cancer, and further work is necessary to define its scope.\r"

There was a positive relationship between degree of neurobehavioral and emotional abnormality.

The findings are discussed in relation to previous research and to their implications regarding posttraumatic emotional adjustment.\r"

  ".W": "Associated injuries to the neck, chest, or abdomen are found in approximately one-quarter of all civilians with penetrating spinal cord or cauda equina injuries. While the value of and indications for general surgical exploration and repair of these injuries are fairly self-evident, the value of neurosurgical intervention in terms of neurological outcome and infection prophylaxis remains the subject of debate. To study this issue, 160 civilian patients with penetrating spinal injuries and neurological deficits were retrospectively reviewed. Associated injuries of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi, or bowel were seen in 107 individuals (67%); 33 (31%) of these patients had abdominal injuries, 25 (23%) had neck injuries, 23 (21%) had thoracic injuries, and 26 (24%) had injuries occurring at multiple sites. Of these 107 patients, 67 (63%) had complete neurological injuries and the remaining 40 (37%) demonstrated incomplete deficits. All 107 patients underwent surgical exploration and repair of their visceral injuries; in 19 of them a neurosurgical procedure was also performed for decompression of the neural elements and/or debridement of the wound. Regardless of the presence of associated visceral injuries, the mechanism of injury, and the extent of the neurological deficit, no statistically significant difference in neurological outcome was found in patients with or without neurosurgical intervention. Complications associated with neurological injury were reported in 17 (11%) of the total group of 160 patients. Four (21%) of the 19 patients who had neurosurgical intervention suffered a related complication, compared to only six (7%) of the 88 patients who were managed conservatively (p less than 0.05). Within the limitations of a retrospective review, the results of this study do not clearly support the value of routine neurosurgical intervention as an adjunct to general surgical repair in cases of spinal injury associated with penetrating visceral trauma.\r"

  ".W": "A controlled randomized study of endoscopic evacuation versus medical treatment was performed in 100 patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral (subcortical, putaminal, and thalamic) hematomas. Patients with aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, brain tumors, or head injuries were excluded. Criteria for inclusion were as follows: patients' age between 30 and 80 years; a hematoma volume of more than 10 cu cm; the presence of neurological or consciousness impairment; the appropriateness of surgery from a medical and anesthesiological point of view; and the initiation of treatment within 48 hours after hemorrhage. The criteria of randomization were the location, size, and side of the hematoma as well as the patient's age, state of consciousness, and history of hypertension. Evaluation of outcome was performed 6 months after hemorrhage. Surgical patients with subcortical hematomas showed a significantly lower mortality rate (30%) than their medically treated counterparts (70%, p less than 0.05). Moreover, 40% of these patients had a good outcome with no or only a minimal deficit versus 25% in the medically treated group; the difference was statistically significant for operated patients with no postoperative deficit (p less than 0.01). Surgical patients with hematomas smaller than 50 cu cm made a significantly better functional recovery than did patients of the medically treated group, but had a comparable mortality rate. By contrast, patients with larger hematomas showed significantly lower mortality rates after operation but had no better functional recovery than the medically treated group. This effect from surgery was limited to patients in a preoperatively alert or somnolent state; stuporous or comatose patients had no better outcome after surgery. The outcome of surgical patients with putaminal or thalamic hemorrhage was no better than for those with medical treatment; however, there was a trend toward better quality of survival and chance of survival in the operated group.\r"

Neither histological parameters nor tumor location (median, paramedian, or lateral cerebellar) affected patient survival. The desmoplastic variant was encountered in 38% of these adult medulloblastomas and occurred in all three cerebellar locations. The degree of surgical resection did not have a major effect on long-term survival; long-term survival was possible even in patients who had received only a biopsy. The extent of initial radiation therapy was positively correlated with recurrence-free survival; full neuraxis irradiation was associated with a 13% incidence of delayed spinal metastases, whereas 75% of patients treated with irradiation of only the posterior fossa and/or the whole brain developed spinal deposits. A similar local recurrence rate (12.5%) was noted in both irradiation groups. Chemotherapy resulted in palliation in some patients with metastatic disease.\r"

Following surgery, all three received combined cobalt-60 irradiation and intrathecal colloidal radioactive gold (198Au) therapy, and died from rupture of the aneurysm 19, 9, and 17 years after the radiotherapy, respectively. Autopsy examination revealed no recurrence of the medulloblastoma, but widespread radiation-induced vasculopathy was found at the base of the brain and in the spinal cord, and saccular aneurysms arose from the posterior cerebral arteries at the basal cistern or choroidal fissure. The aneurysms differed from the ordinary saccular aneurysms of congenital type in their location and histological features. Their locations corresponded to the areas where intrathecally administered colloidal 198Au is likely to pool, and they originated directly from a segment of the artery rather than from a branching site as in congenital saccular aneurysms. It is, therefore, concluded that the aneurysms in these three patients were most likely radiation-induced.\r"

A total of 9295 angiograms were reviewed from January, 1980, to January, 1987, and, based on these, 278 patients with minimal bias for the presence of an aneurysm were selected. Three patients were found to have incidental aneurysms; thus, the angiographic frequency of patients with asymptomatic aneurysms in this series was 1%. This patient population is skewed toward the older age groups and probably over-represents the incidence of these aneurysms in the population at large. Comparing current subarachnoid hemorrhage statistics and the low frequency of asymptomatic aneurysms suggests that a larger percentage of these aneurysms than was previously thought subsequently rupture. This study contrasts sharply with previous reports quoting a high incidence of aneurysms, and significantly alters the concept and treatment of this disease.\r"

For this reason, patients treated at the authors' institution in whom a large portion of the aneurysm neck or sac remained after application of a clip or ligature have been subjected to reoperation. However, 1- to 2-mm residual necks seen in postoperative angiography have been thought to pose little risk. Some cases of aneurysms recurring from a narrow residual neck after clipping have been reported, and a few instances of recurrent aneurysm have been described after apparently complete occlusion of the neck (as observed angiographically or in the surgeon's judgment). In recent years, a surprising number of cases have been presented in which this seemingly unimportant remnant of the neck dilated over a long period to become a dangerous aneurysm. This finding stresses the importance of complete aneurysm occlusion and of postoperative angiography for the recognition of a residual aneurysm neck. This should be important not only in aneurysm clipping but also in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with detachable balloons.\r"

  ".W": "The authors review 42 consecutive cases of benign astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors of the cerebral hemispheres in children undergoing surgery in the pediatric service of the Hopital des Enfants Malades between 1975 and 1987. Epilepsy was the presenting sign in 76% of the children and remained the only clinical sign at diagnosis in 62%. Partial or complex partial seizures were observed in half of the cases, but other seizure types were also frequent. Diagnosis of the tumor as the etiological agent rested upon the results of computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative mortality (5%) and morbidity (16%) rates were low. The postoperative intelligence quotient was above 80 in 71% of the patients, and 77% of the children had no major problem in school. Although only two of the 42 patients were given postoperative radiotherapy, there were no recurrences in 82% of the survivors. The actuarial probability of nonrecurrence of the tumor was 95% at 5 years. Three patients with recurrent tumor underwent further surgery and are, at the present time, recurrence-free. The incidence of epilepsy fell from 76% before surgery to 19% after removal of the tumor alone; therefore, intraoperative electrocorticography and resection of the electrically abnormal cortex at the time of the first surgical procedure do not appear necessary. It is possible that tumor removal restores a mechanism that limits the spread of seizures and, thus, the clinical manifestations of epilepsy. Benign astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors of the cerebral hemispheres in children should not be treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, at least initially.\r"

This enzyme is a primary intracellular repair mechanism for lesions produced at the O6 position of guanine by a wide range of alkylating agents, including nitrosoureas and procarbazine. Its activity ranged from undetectable in five tumor lines to 2338 fmol/mg protein in N-1941, a human glioblastoma xenograft. The sensitivity of 10 of these xenografts to procarbazine was determined and it was found that four of the five tumor lines with AT levels of more than 100 fmol/mg protein had growth delays after procarbazine treatment of less than 20 days, whereas all five lines with undetectable AT levels had growth delays of over 30 days. The primary cytotoxic DNA adduct produced by procarbazine (namely, O6-methylguanine) was found to be significantly higher in two sensitive lines with low AT levels than in a highly resistant line with a high AT level. These data suggest that the AT levels of individual brain tumors can be used as predictive indicators of their susceptibility to drugs that exert their antineoplastic effect primarily by O6-alkylation of guanine in nuclear DNA.\r"

  ".U": "89177514\r", 
  ".W": "Safe and effective use of hyperthermia for the treatment of brain tumors requires precise control of the distribution of temperatures (that is, the thermal field) within the tumor and within the adjacent brain. Major influences upon the distribution of temperatures include the passive thermal properties of the brain, such as its specific heat (Cb), and the contribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Recently, an electrical-mechanical analog model of heat flow within the brain has been developed from which an expression for CBF has been derived: CBF = Cb/(tau rho c) where tau is the thermal decay constant, rho is the density of blood, and c is its specific heat. To test this model a series of experiments was carried out in adult dogs in which stereotaxically implanted microwave antennas operating at 2450 MHz, fluoro-optical thermometry probes, and platinum electrodes were used to simultaneously measure CBF by thermal washout and hydrogen clearance techniques. The correlation coefficient for estimates of CBF derived by the two methods in 52 paired observations was 0.89. Measurements of CBF were more reliable at increased distances from the microwave antenna, since CBF is sensitive to the degree of temperature elevation (delta T). The ratio of post-heating CBF to pre-heating CBF varies linearly with delta T and has a correlation coefficient of 0.86. When values of CBF determined by the hydrogen clearance method were employed in the above equation, it was possible to derive Cb as 0.70 +/- 0.08 cal/gm-degrees C. Use of this value for Cb in this equation produces estimates of CBF by thermal clearance that are within 10% of the values for CBF as measured by the hydrogen clearance method. It is concluded that this model of thermal flow within the brain may have heuristic value for treatment planning and that microwave antennas and fluoro-optical probes may represent a new methodology for the clinical estimation of CBF. These methods have recently been employed in patients undergoing combined hyperthermia and chemotherapy.\r"

The vasodilator activity of antithrombin III on rabbit arteries was first assessed in vitro using a myograph-arterial ring preparation. Antithrombin III (10 IU/ml) induced a 55.4% +/- 2.66% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) relaxation in basilar artery precontracted with serotonin (5-HT) in five specimens as compared with a 9.8% +/- 1.6% relaxation of common carotid artery in six specimens. For in vivo analysis, 21 New Zealand White male rabbits were separated into three groups: Group 1 served as normal controls; Group 2 received a subarachnoid blood injection (SAH) and were sacrificed on Day 3 thereafter; and Group 3 animals were subjected to SAH, then received a 2-hour intracisternal infusion of antithrombin III (100 IU) in saline prior to sacrifice on Day 3. Basilar artery caliber was determined using a morphometric method to analyze perfusion-fixed arterial segments. Control basilar artery diameter in Group 1 was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm. In Group 2 a 27% reduction in arterial caliber to 0.47 +/- 0.03 mm was observed by Day 3 post SAH (p less than 0.0001). Group 3 animals had a mean basilar artery diameter of 0.68 +/- 0.02 mm. This was significantly larger than the untreated SAH rabbits in Group 2 (p less than 0.0001), but not different from control artery diameters in Group 1. The findings demonstrate that antithrombin III in saline has a significant ability to reverse delayed narrowing of the rabbit basilar artery after SAH.\r"

  ".W": "Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy (MRS) allow the noninvasive in vivo study of a variety of anatomical, physiological, and biochemical alterations that may occur in different cerebral pathologies. The authors have investigated the use of MR imaging and MRS to monitor the evolution of experimental focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced in 36 rats, and 12 normal rats were used as a control group. Changes in high-energy phosphate metabolites were followed in vivo using MRS during the 1st hour and at 3 and 6 hours after ischemic insult. Changes in vivo MR images were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours after ischemic insult. Significant decreases (p less than 0.05) in phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratios and intracellular pH values occurred immediately after the induction of ischemia. The presence of an infarcted area seen on MR images was a constant finding at 3 hours after ischemic insult, and was well defined and localized at 12 and 24 hours. The location of areas of infarction seen on MR images correlated well with areas identified histopathologically. The T1 and T2 MR relaxation times were significantly increased 3 hours after ischemic insult and remained prolonged for at least 24 hours. The results show that MR imaging is a sensitive method to measure cerebral infarction, and that MRS is a sensitive measure of changes that occur in the early phases of ischemia, perhaps when cellular changes may still be reversible. At 3 and 6 hours after the ischemic insult, however, 31P-MRS spectra may appear to be \"normal\" despite the presence of well-documented areas of infarction.\r"

Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in both cases disclosed a suprasellar mass lesion in continuity with the hypothalamus. Removal of the lesions affected the endocrinological status and/or seizure control. Pathological examination revealed the lesions to be composed of well-differentiated neuronal and glial cells. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated the presence of beta-endorphin, corticotropin-releasing factor, oxytocin, and neurofilament protein (210 kD) in the neuronal cells of the first patient, but no neuropeptides were detected in the second. Electron microscopic examination on the second patient disclosed the presence of many nonmyelinated and some myelinated neuronal processes containing dense-core and clear vesicles. The morphological characteristics and the role of surgery for this lesion are discussed.\r"

Findings pertain to how patients deal with the interpersonal and social ramifications of diagnosis and surgical treatment. Fatalism, delays in help-seeking, responses to diagnosis, postsurgical anxiety, and adjustment were reported. Reassurance prior to surgery was sometimes found to limit understanding of postoperative impairment. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons were seen in heroic or imposing roles that impacted on their capacity to be supportive to patients coping with life change and \"handicap.\" The patient treatment decisions were found to be determined by attitudes about death, which motivated patients and surgeons to make difficult or extreme choices. Suffering, social changes, and postoperative uncertainty were patient concerns. Patient strategies for adjusting to disfiguration are examined, and specific recommendations for the oral and maxillofacial surgeon are made.\r"

  ".W": "Five anemic, transfusion-dependent patients aged 12 to 18 years, who had end-stage renal disease (mean hematocrit value 22 +/- 0.31%) and were on a regimen of peritoneal dialysis, were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo), which was self-administered at home by subcutaneous injections thrice weekly at an initial dosage of 150 U/kg. All patients had an increase in the reticulocyte count and hemoglobin concentration, and none required further transfusions. The hematocrit level rose to a mean of 33.04 +/- 1.86% within 3 weeks of rHuEpo therapy, and the dosage was adjusted to keep the hematocrit level between 32% and 38% indefinitely. Currently four of these patients require only one dose a week to sustain the hematocrit level. No antibodies to the rHuEpo were formed. Three patients had an exacerbation of hypertension, which required an adjustment in antihypertensive therapy. No other side effects were noted. The results demonstrate that rHuEpo is effective in correcting the anemia of end-stage renal disease, thereby eliminating the associated clinical symptoms and the need for further blood transfusions.\r"

The results generally confirmed those of other studies, with the exception of a higher incidence of SIDS among Chinese and Japanese babies and a lower incidence among Hispanic babies, all in comparison with white, non-Spanish (Anglo) infants. Median age at death was found to vary by birth weight, with very low birth weight babies being about 6 weeks older (postnatal age) than normal birth weight babies at time of death. The association of the risk factors with SIDS remained when birth weight data were statistically controlled; the association of these risk factors with SIDS cannot be explained by their relationship to birth weight. An interaction was found between race and maternal age and between multiparity and type of hospital of birth. There was no interaction between birth weight and the other risk factors.\r"

In four cases, including three reported elsewhere, a Taql restriction site alteration directly detected the mutation. In 10 additional cases, only an affected male was available, and results of DNA analysis using the Taql enzyme were normal. In 10 cases, family studies were performed with the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Prenatal diagnostic studies were performed for three informative pregnancies, and two affected male fetuses were identified. Analysis of two restriction fragment length polymorphisms, Mspla and BamHl, was informative in 14 of 19 (74%) known carrier females and in 21 of 35 (60%) females (the total number studied). One female previously predicted to be a noncarrier by protein-loading test was determined to be a carrier by analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The frequency of Taql site alterations was 4 of 24 families (17%). These data illustrate the importance of DNA analysis, pedigree analysis, and biochemical testing in families with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency to detect carriers and establish the diagnosis prenatally.\r"

Infants with asymptomatic severe posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus were managed with a predetermined protocol. Outcome between groups at 1 to 2 years and at more than 3 years was compared. The natural history study, restricted to the inborn population, revealed that posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus developed in 53 of 409 infants with intraventricular hemorrhage. The progression of hydrocephalus either was arrested or regressed in 35 of 53 infants; progression to severe hydrocephalus occurred in 18 of 53 infants. The severe posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus was asymptomatic in 16 of 18 infants. The management and outcome study included both inborn and outborn infants. Of 50 infants, 12 had symptomatic severe hydrocephalus and 38 had asymptomatic severe hydrocephalus. The 16 infants managed with close observation were as likely to remain shunt free as the 22 infants managed with serial lumbar punctures. Of 38 infants, 20 were managed without shunts. At 3 to 6 years, the outcome of infants in the close observation group did not differ from that in the lumbar puncture group. Long-term outcome of infants with progression to asymptomatic severe hydrocephalus did not differ from that of infants in whom disease progression was arrested. Poor outcome in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage and subsequent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus was related to severity of hemorrhage and gestational age at birth less than 30 weeks. Because long-term outcome of infants with severe hydrocephalus did not differ from that of infants in whom the progression of hydrocephalus was arrested or whose condition improved before hydrocephalus became severe, we currently attempt medical management of these infants.\r"

Infants were randomly assigned to receive either a 1:1 mixture of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide orally (n = 12) (3 mg/kg/day of both compounds) or no treatment (n = 9) for 6 to 8 days each. Dynamic lung compliance, total pulmonary resistance, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation were measured on the first and last days of each study period. Fluid intake and urine output were measured each day. Although the treatment significantly increased urine output, neither lung mechanics nor oxygenation were improved by the drug. The magnitude of the diuresis achieved with spironolactone-hydrochlorothiazide treatment was comparable to the diuresis achieved in a previous study of furosemide treatment (J Pediatr 1986:109;1034-9). Statistical analysis indicated that a type II error was an unlikely explanation for our failure to detect a beneficial effect. In three patients, doubling the oral dose did not improve lung mechanics or oxygenation. We speculate that diuresis per se is not responsible for lung function improvement during treatment with other drugs with diuretic properties.\r"

The mean difference between paired measurements with the two techniques in 26 subjects was negligible (less than 1 ml/kg/min), with 95% confidence limits being approximately 11% of the mean Doppler-derived cardiac output. In addition, the two techniques related well (correlation coefficient r = 0.94) over a wide range of Doppler-derived cardiac output measurements (120 to 530 ml/kg/min). In 8 of the 26 subjects, cardiac output was observed for 7 to 12 hours. The mean difference between the Doppler and impedance techniques was 6.1% to -0.7% of the Doppler value. Thoracic electrical bioimpedance is applicable to newborn infants and offers a continuous noninvasive method of cardiac output measurement.\r"

Psychologic assessments of each child were performed twice before intravenous administration of lorazepam (0.03 mg/kg), and 1 1/2 hours and 24 hours after lorazepam; there were no significant changes in long-term memory, attention, or somatic symptoms. There was a significant decrease in affective symptoms at 1 1/2 hours (p = 0.011), with a trend toward decreased anxiety at 1 1/2 and 24 hours after lorazepam (p = 0.026 and 0.028, respectively). There was also a selective anterograde amnestic effect in 5 of 16 children after lorazepam (p = 0.06). Mean (+/- SD) lorazepam systemic clearance was 1.3 +/- 0.4 ml/min/kg, with a terminal half-life of 10.5 +/- 2.9 hours and an unbound clearance of 15.9 +/- 5.2 ml/min/kg. A group of healthy adult volunteers who were given lorazepam had a mean systemic clearance of 1.0 +/- 0.4 ml/min/kg, somewhat less than that of the children (p = 0.069). There were no significant differences in any lorazepam pharmacokinetic parameter between those children who did versus those who did not have changes in affective symptoms or amnesia. These data should be helpful in establishing the dose of lorazepam in children, as the drug becomes more widely used as an antiemetic, premedicant, and anticonvulsant agent.\r"

An analysis of the data revealed that the risk factors were primiparity, a fundally implanted placenta and delivery of a macrosomic fetus. Also, patients who received oxytocin with or without MgSO4 were at higher risk of puerperal inversion. MgSO4 by itself did not appear to be a risk factor. A placenta attached at the time of inversion appeared to have a protective effect against the development of shock. The use of betamimetics or MgSO4 appeared to be an acceptable alternative to general anesthesia in relaxing the uterus and aiding in its repositioning. Those agents were more likely to be successful in acute cases than in subacute ones and in second-degree inversion than in third-degree.\r"

Results also indicate that GCS was superior to any other score in predicting outcome of patients and allowed better specificity and sensitivity. Regarding the level of care needed by patients, TISS was superior to any other scoring system. The difficulty in estimating individual prognosis is discussed, since scoring systems are aimed at classifying groups of patients, not individuals. It is concluded that GCS is a simpler and less time consuming method in predicting outcome of patients with head trauma.\r"

We have previously shown that complete white cell and platelet removal does not always occur and that the retained platelet-leukocyte deposit is potentially harmful (2). In this study we investigated the hydraulic conditions in the centrifuge bowl that allow activated platelets and leukocytes to adhere, the histology of the resulting cellular deposit, and the effects of reinfusing a saline extract of the deposit. Earlier work had suggested that the addition of calcium, of partially clotted blood, and of excessive saline should be avoided during intraoperative rbc salvage (2). The present observations explain, in part, why such measures would be expected to be beneficial.\r"

This study was undertaken to examine the risks and benefits likely to be found when such care is provided in a hazardous environment, such as the battlefield, or the scene of a terrorist attack or domestic criminal action. Data for casualties from the Vietnam conflict were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of cervical spine immobilization on the battlefield. In this population, penetrating cervical cord injury was always fatal and usually immediately so. Only 1.4% of all casualties who were candidates for immobilization might have benefitted from the care. However, the risk of performing immobilization in a hazardous environment is substantial since about 10% of casualties are incurred while helping other casualties. Mandatory immobilization of all casualties with penetrating neck wounds sustained in an environment hazardous to first aid providers has an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio.\r"

  ".W": "To prevent serious complications and facilitate efficient and effective management of patients admitted to the emergency department or intensive care settings, it is extremely important to differentiate, quickly, between elevated concentrations of alcohol in the blood and compromised neurological status due to brain injury or other pathology. This research analyzed the relationship between blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) estimated from venous blood samples and those estimated from breath samples that were obtained using the Alco-Sensor III device with an attached tube for passive nasal breath sampling. Blood and breath samples, as well as brief medical histories and demographic and environmental data, were obtained and recorded for 35 adult trauma patients admitted to two major urban emergency departments. Passively expired nasal breath provided an excellent estimate of BAC measured from venous blood (range, 0 to 0.32) as evidenced in the extremely high regression coefficient (r = 0.99; slope = 1.22; p less than 0.0001). BAC assessment and monitoring, through the application of passive nasal breath sampling, provides a means of rapidly estimating BAC, and thus can facilitate diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate management and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Inhalation injury complicated by bacterial pneumonia is now one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with thermal injury. We have investigated the use of high-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) as a means of ventilatory support for these patients. We propose that high-frequency ventilation may decrease the incidence of pulmonary infection following inhalation injury and decrease the incidence of iatrogenic barotrauma caused by conventional ventilation. High-frequency ventilation was instituted initially as salvage therapy in a group of five patients. In each case, normocapnia or arterial pO2 saturation of greater than 90% on a FIO2 of 60% or less was achieved with high-frequency ventilation but not with conventional ventilation. A second group of ten patients was prospectively entered into a study on the use of HFPV in patients with inhalation injury. One patient was removed from the study, and one patient was unable to be ventilated because of severely noncompliant lungs. Eight patients with a mean age of 29 years and a mean burn size of 38% of the total body surface completed the protocol. All patients survived, two developed pneumonia, and one developed subcutaneous emphysema. These results suggest that HFPV is effective in the treatment of patients with severe inhalation injury.\r"

  ".W": "Immunization with pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccines is advocated after splenectomy; however, experimental and clinical data suggest an impaired antibody response in splenectomized individuals. This study examined the value of splenic autotransplantation at various sites in augmenting the antibody response to Type III pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide in mice immunized 3 months after operation. Splenectomy resulted in impaired antibody responses compared to sham-operated mice (p less than 0.001) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice with intraperitoneal splenic autotransplants, but not mice with subcutaneous or intramuscular transplants, had greater antibody responses compared to splenectomized mice (p less than 0.05). Antibody responses were elevated only in mice autotransplanted with 50% or more of the original splenic mass. Since autotransplantation of splenic tissue augments the antibody response to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, the combination of splenic autotransplantation and pneumococcal vaccination may confer more protection than either modality alone in individuals who must undergo splenectomy.\r"
