  ".W": "The vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) are mediated via activation of guanylate cyclase; this process is believed to require the availability of free sulfhydryl groups. Previous studies in man have shown that the sulfhydryl donor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) potentiates the systemic and coronary vasodilator effects of NTG. Furthermore, interaction of NTG and NAC may lead to the formation of S-nitroso-NAC, which strongly inhibits platelet aggregation. The effects of intravenous NTG combined with intravenous NAC (5 g 6 hourly) were compared with those of intravenous NTG alone in a double-blind trial in 46 patients with severe unstable angina pectoris unresponsive to conventional treatment, which included calcium antagonists and cutaneous nitrates in all but one patient. Treatment with NTG/NAC (24 patients) and that with NTG alone (22 patients) was associated with a similar frequency of episodes of chest pain and of increments in NTG infusion rate for pain control (10 vs 17; p = NS). The NTG/NAC group had a significantly lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction than the NTG/placebo group (three vs 10 patients; p = .013). Symptomatic hypotension occurred frequently in the NTG/NAC group (seven vs 0 patients; p = .006). Lactate-pyruvate ratios and venous NTG concentrations were not significantly affected by NAC. Subsequently, another 20 consecutive patients were treated with intravenous NTG and continuously infused NAC (10 g/day). Seven remained pain free during the first 24 hr of NTG infusion; 11 required increments in NTG infusion rate for pain control. Acute myocardial infarction occurred in one patient, while none developed symptomatic hypotension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Accessory pathways showing decremental properties and inserting into the right ventricle have been frequently described as \"nodoventricular\" or Mahaim pathways. However, conclusive evidence for a nodal origination of such pathways is lacking. The patient in this study had characteristics typical of such a pathway. Antegradely, the pathway showed decremental, nodelike conduction properties. With the aid of right bundle branch recordings, the pathway was demonstrated to insert directly into the right bundle branch. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia could be readily initiated by atrial or ventricular pacing. The QRS morphology was normal during sinus rhythm and demonstrated a left bundle branch block pattern with normal axis during tachycardia. The reentrant circuit involved antegrade conduction over the accessory pathway and retrograde conduction via the bundle branches, His bundle, and the atrioventricular node. More significantly, late atrial stimuli delivered during tachycardia could preexcite the ventricle via the accessory pathway despite their inability to enter the atrioventricular node. Thus, the upper \"turn around\" of the reentrant circuit involved atrial tissue and the accessory pathway originated directly from the right atrium independent of the atrioventricular node. In view of these new findings and other recent observations during surgical resection of similar pathways, a reassessment of previous descriptions of \"nodoventricular\" fibers may be necessary. Many of these pathways may actually represent atriofascicular or atrioventricular connections with decremental properties.\r"

  ".W": "Previous evidence suggests that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) interferes with the autonomic control of circulation. In the present study we investigated whether ANF modulates forearm vasoconstriction reflexly induced by cardiopulmonary receptor unloading in man. For this purpose, the hemodynamic response to -20 mm Hg lower body negative pressure (LBNP) was assessed under control conditions and during the constant infusion of alpha-human ANF (0.5 micrograms/kg bolus followed by 0.05 micrograms/kg/min) in seven normal subjects. ANF infusion resulted in a slight reduction in blood pressure and right atrial pressure, did not modify heart rate or forearm vascular resistance, but significantly potentiated the reflex increase in forearm vascular resistance during LBNP (+25 +/- 9% under control conditions vs +40 +/- 12% during ANF, p less than .05). In an attempt to clarify the mechanisms underlying the enhanced reflex vasoconstriction during infusion of ANF, in five additional subjects we demonstrated that there was a comparable vascular reflex response to LBNP under control conditions and during nitroglycerin infusion at a dose that induced a reduction in atrial pressure comparable to that observed during ANF. Finally, in seven additional subjects we found that ANF infusion did not alter the reflex hemodynamic responses elicited by carotid baroreceptor unloading induced by a +60 mm Hg increase in external neck pressure. We conclude that during the infusion of a pharmacologic dose of ANF the reflex forearm vasoconstriction in response to selective cardiopulmonary receptor unloading is potentiated. This effect does not seem to be related to the hemodynamic actions of the peptide or to interference with the sympathetic control of peripheral circulation.\r"

  ".W": "Biochemical modification of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) designed to alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics offers promise for development of pharmaceuticals particularly suitable for treatment of specific disorders and for induction of coronary thrombolysis by intramuscular as well as intravenous administration. Accordingly, to identify biochemical determinants of clearance of t-PA from the circulation, we injected rabbits intravenously with three different preparations of t-PA synthesized from the same human gene and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells cultured under disparate conditions. Influences of glycosylation on clearance were defined by experiments with enzymatically treated t-PA in which clearance was assessed with concomitant administration of selected neoglycoproteins that compete with t-PA for specific glycoprotein receptors. The role of an intact active catalytic site, as reflected by differences in clearance with and without prior treatment of t-PA with the protease inhibitor PPACK, was defined also. Results indicate that clearance is altered by inhibition of the active site and that the nature and extent of glycosylation--not evident simply by analysis of peptide structure--influence clearance as well. These findings suggest that mannose/N-acetylglucosamine-specific glycoprotein receptors expressed on hepatic reticuloendothelial cells participate in clearance of t-PA from the circulation but that galactose-specific glycoprotein receptors probably do not. The observations may explain differences in clearance seen with different preparations of t-PA that have been seen in clinical pilot studies and may identify biochemical determinants of clearance amenable to modification for development of agents with potentially desirable, specific biological properties.\r"

Intraosseous pressure was recorded and lactate concentrations and pH were measured in blood samples obtained from the two femoral heads. The subchondral pO2 in the diseased hip was significantly lower than pO2 in the normal hip (43 torr versus 63 torr). The intraosseous pressure was significantly higher in the diseased than in the normal hip. The lactate concentration showed a 50% increase in the diseased hip. There were no differences in pCO2 and pH between the two locations.\r"

  ".W": "Forty male New Zealand white rabbits were treated with immobilization and forcible manipulation of the right knee known to cause ectopic bone formation in the quadriceps muscle. The animals were also treated with either: A) A total radiation dose of 1840 rad (18.4 Gy); B) A 0.5 mg/kg/day oral dose of prednisolone; C) 10 mg/kg/day of indomethacin, given in two oral doses; D) Ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate (EHDP) given in a 20-mg/kg/day oral dose; or E) with the vehicle given alone as a control. The experimental period was four weeks, and the amount of ectopic bone was determined by planimetry of serial transverse sections of the femur. The degree of knee stiffness was recorded during the experiment. The amount (mean +/- SEM) of ectopic bone was 1.412 +/- 0.264 cm3 in controls; it was insignificantly higher in the EHDP-treated group, but significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in rabbits treated with radiation (0.390 +/- 0.094 cm3), prednisolone (0.181 +/- 0.076 cm3), and indomethacin (0.314 +/- 0.112 cm3). In control animals and those given EHDP, the treatment invariably led to almost complete stiffness of the right knee. The rabbits treated with prednisolone and indomethacin offered the least resistance to the manipulations, and the group treated with radiation showed intermediate stiffness. Semiquantitative histologic evaluation demonstrated less inflammation in the group treated with prednisolone than in the control group.\r"

The study was carried out on 36 children between 2 and 16 years of age. The study group was divided into three groups, each comprised of 12 children. It was shown that the anemic children have lower PO2, higher PCO2 and higher levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine than the control group (p less than 0.05). There was a negative linear correlation between lactate levels and hemoglobin values (r = -0.6213; p less than 0.05), but no correlation between hemoglobin and the alanine and pyruvate levels. Levels of lactate, pyruvate and alanine were similar in the iron deficiency and the other anemia groups. In conclusion, iron has no direct effect on the levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, but the hypoxemia caused by anemia could be responsible for the higher levels of the lactate, pyruvate, and alanine. In cases with high levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, anemia has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hyperlactatemia.\r"

The body composition of the nonseptic patients, who received 51.9 +/- 1.5 kcal/kg.day, improved significantly, while that of the septic patients, receiving 46.8 +/- 1.1 kcal/kg.day was only maintained. The relationship between caloric intake and the restoration of a malnourished body cell mass (BCM) was determined for each group by correlating, using multiple linear regression, the mean daily change in the BCM with the caloric intake and the nutritional state, as determined by body composition. According to the resultant regressions, an intake of 35.1 and 50.7 kcal/kg.day was required to maintain the BCM of the septic and nonseptic patients, respectively. To restore a depleted BCM, caloric intakes in excess of this amount are required.\r"

Despite similar national demographic and hospital patient characteristics, there were substantial differences in the use of intensive care. The N.Z. hospitals designated 1.7% of their total beds for intensive care compared to 5.6% in the U.S. hospitals. The average age for N.Z. admissions was 42 compared to 55 in the U.S. (p less than .0001). The N.Z. ICUs admitted fewer patients with severe chronic failing health (N.Z. 8.7%, U.S. 18%) and following elective surgery (N.Z. 8%, U.S. 40%). Approximately half the N.Z. admissions were for trauma, drug overdose, and asthma while these diagnoses accounted for 11% of U.S. admissions. When controlled for differences in case mix and severity of illness, hospital mortality rates in N.Z. were comparable to the U.S. This study demonstrates substantial differences in patient selection among these U.S. and N.Z. ICUs that have equal technical and manpower capabilities and provide similar high-quality intensive care. Physicians from both countries justify the differences on medical criteria; however, both approaches to patient selection cannot be optimal. Additional outcome comparisons between acutely ill patients treated in the U.S. and N.Z. could help refine ICU selection criteria and improve the precision of clinical decision-making.\r"

Eight patients suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and had an admission Glasgow Coma Score of 3 or 4. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed on five of these patients. Three received cerebral resuscitation with controlled hyperventilation, hypothermia, pentobarbital, and mannitol because of intracranial hypertension. After CPR, a low cardiac index (CI) and high systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were found. When cerebral resuscitative therapy was initiated later, it caused a reduction of SVRI, CI, mean arterial pressure, and cerebral perfusion pressure. Fluid volume therapy and inotropic cardiac support was necessary to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. These observations indicate that cerebral resuscitative therapy can affect cardiovascular function. The hemodynamic depressive effects might even worsen the outcome. For this reason, it is advisable to obtain CI and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to optimize cerebral perfusion and potentially neurologic outcome.\r"

The ISI was measured by placing a PtcO2 electrode on the forearm and interrupting blood flow by inflating a cuff until the PtcO2 dropped to zero. After releasing the cuff pressure, the initial slope of the PtcO2 trace was determined in order to calculate the ISI. In the PtcO2 range between 40 and 100 torr, the ARI and ISI did not depend on the PtcO2 magnitude. In all groups, the ISI behaved similarly to the ARI. We conclude that the noninvasive ISI and invasive ARI are able to differentiate between stable and insufficient peripheral circulation (ISI less than 0.75, ARI less than 0.8; p less than .001).\r"

Of the 57 patients tested, 12 had tuberculosis (TB), 13 had malignant disease, 14 acute pneumonia or chronic destructive pneumonia, 13 had no demonstrable disease, and five had miscellaneous diseases. The mean optical density (OD) at 492 nm for a 1 in 40 dilution of serum of patients with TB was 0.338 +/- 0.218 and for control subjects was 0.162 +/- 0.098 (p = 0.0323). Values for neat BW were 0.317 +/- 0.122 for TB patients and 0.191 +/- 0.140 for control subjects (p = 0.0084). Using stepwise discriminant analysis, the ELISA on serum gave a sensitivity of 70.0 percent and specificity of 86.4 percent and 83.3 percent correct classification. When applied to BW, there was a 72.7 percent sensitivity, a 82.2 percent specificity, and patients were correctly classified in 80.4 percent of cases.

  ".W": "Alteplase is a human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is a relatively fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent, used primarily to lyse coronary artery clots. It has proven effective in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite continuous reevaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters for t-PA, limited distribution and clearance data mandate administration of t-PA as a continuous infusion. Tissue plasminogen activator is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism with an elimination half-life of five to ten minutes. Plasma levels show great interindividual variation but correlate with infusion rate and decrease in fibrinogen level. The current recommended dose is 100 mg administered as a 10-mg iv bolus followed by a continuous infusion over three hours. However, 40-150 mg has been used in clinical trials. The compound has undergone extensive testing, comparing it with placebo and streptokinase (SK), and combining it with angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery. Tissue plasminogen activator is effective at opening clotted coronary arteries in approximately 70 percent of AMI patients and has been shown to be approximately twice as effective as SK in one U.S. trial. Although there is considerable evidence of efficacy with t-PA, data evaluating the influence of t-PA on mortality are limited, but suggest a reduction to five percent. Currently, thrombolytic therapy is indicated for patients experiencing a transmural AMI with onset of symptoms within three to six hours before presenting to the emergency room. Active internal bleeding or conditions predisposing to serious hemorrhage are contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Six healthy adult volunteers were given a single dose of phenytoin capsules 400 mg po on two occasions. Blood specimens were collected for 48 hours after each dose. In a randomized, crossover fashion, each subject completed the following two phases: (1) phenytoin without enteral feedings, and (2) concomitant enteral feedings before phenytoin and continued at 100 ml/h for ten hours. The areas under the concentration versus time curves from 0-48 hours (AUC0-48) were not significantly different between the two phases (p greater than 0.5). The percent relative bioavailability of phenytoin with enteral feedings was 101.7 percent. This study suggests that enteral feedings do not affect the serum concentrations of phenytoin after a single dose given in capsule form.\r"

Although the prehospital use of thrombolysis is largely unexplored, the interhospital use appears to be safe and effective. The administration of thrombolytic therapy must be a coordinated effort between the emergency physician and the cardiologist. Indications for thrombolytic therapy are still evolving and adverse effects will no doubt increase in incidence once the availability and use of effective thrombolytic agents is widespread. The emergency physician, especially, needs to tread the fine line between \"minutes are myocardium\" and \"haste makes waste.\"\r"

Seizures were tabulated daily on seizure calendars by the patients. Three time periods were examined for seizure frequency, 90 days before VPA treatment and 90 and 180 days after VPA treatment. Twenty-two were \"controlled\" or \"improved\" (reduction of seizure activity by greater than or equal to 51%) 6 months following the initiation of VPA. VPA was particularly effective in 17 patients who had secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) as a subtype of partial seizures. Failure of response to VPA in eight patients appears to be related to their type of partial seizure (SPS or CPS alone, without GTCS) and duration of uncontrolled recurrent seizures. Etiology and compliance were not related to treatment failure. This study supports the need for a double-blind controlled trial with VPA in patients with partial seizures.\r"

The compound was effective in nontoxic doses following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration in mice and oral administration in both mice and rats. In mice, the i.p. administration of ADD 75073 resulted in an ED50 value of 2.6 mg/kg as compared with a value of 9.5 mg/kg for phenytoin (PHT) in the same assay. Compound ADD 75073 was ineffective in nontoxic doses against all other seizure models examined in this study, and thus has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of PHT.\r"

It has mixed dopaminergic-antidopaminergic and alpha 2-antiadrenergic activity, and has proved useful in the clinical management of hyperprolactinemia. However, no trial comparing its use with the standard dopamine agonist bromocriptine has been reported. We have therefore compared three doses of terguride with bromocriptine 2.5 mg and placebo in a randomized double-blind crossover trial in eight normal volunteers. Terguride showed a potent dose-dependent PRL-inhibiting and growth hormone (GH)-releasing effect, while no significant changes were observed in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or luteinizing hormone (LH) in comparison to placebo. The neuroendocrine profile of terguride 1 mg was identical to that of bromocriptine, with a significant reduction in PRL still evident at 24 hours. However, in this small group of normal subjects, the side effects experienced at any dose of terguride were significantly less than with bromocriptine. Terguride 1 mg was always preferred to bromocriptine, while the lower doses were indistinguishable from placebo. Terguride is therefore likely to play an important role in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia.\r"

General linear models procedures did not identify additional significant relationships between various combinations of parameters examined and the gestation type. The authors conclude that IUI with high numbers of motile sperm constitutes a risk factor in the genesis of multiple gestation. The risk of multiple gestation rises significantly when the inseminate contains more than 20 million motile sperm.\r"

The authors demonstrated that PRL (greater than or equal to 10 ng/ml) inhibits basal as well as FSH (10 ng/ml)-stimulated E2 and P secretion. This PRL effect was overcome only by FSH maximal stimulating doses (100 ng/ml). These results suggest a direct inhibitory effect of PRL on granulosa cell steroidogenesis acting as a negative modulator of FSH action.

Blood was drawn at the same time in many cases to compare hormonal levels in serum with those in the breast cyst fluids (BCF). The levels of beta-hCG in BCF were relatively high, with a mean (+/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) of 58.9 +/- 16.8 mIU/ml; serum levels of beta-hCG were negligible. LH and TSH also were elevated in BCF compared with serum levels, exhibiting mean values (+/- SEM) of 26.7 +/- 4.3 mIU/ml and 6.4 +/- 0.44 muIU/ml, respectively. The levels of FSH and PRL in BCF were equivalent to the levels in the serum. The presence of biologically active hCG was suggested in several BCF samples using the rat ovarian hyperemia test. Samples of BCF were assessed for the capacity to stimulate Leydig cell testosterone production in vitro in the presence or absence of an anti-hLH antiserum. Testosterone production was significantly (P less than 0.05) enhanced, even in the presence of the antiserum. These data suggest that BCF contains biologically active hCG.\r"

Clomiphene citrate (100 to 150 mg daily on cycle days 5 to 9) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; 75 to 150 IU daily from cycle day 6) were used for stimulation. Embryo transfer (ET) occurred in 164 (81.2%) of the LH surge cycles and 452 (84%; P = not significant [NS] of the hCG cycles. The first urinary rise in LH was detected in the 6 or 9 A.M. collections in 78 (47.3%) of the LH surge cycles, a greater number (P less than 0.01) than expected if LH surge onset was random. A total of 107 pregnancies was achieved, for an overall pregnancy rate of 17.4% per ET. The pregnancy rate in the hCG-stimulated cycles was 13.9% per ET (63/452) and, in spontaneous LH surge cycles, was 28.8% (44/166; P less than 0.001). The spontaneous abortion rate was 9.1% in LH surge cycles, compared with 25.4% in hCG-triggered cycles (P less than 0.001). The result was a 2.4 times increase in live births for LH surge cycles compared with cycles in which hCG was administered. In this program, occurrence of an LH surge is a favorable event, associated with higher pregnancy and live birth rates than hCG-stimulated cycles, and usually occurring in the early morning, allowing oocyte retrieval during normal working hours.\r"

Significant variation in hMG lots was observed using this assay. When subjected to chromatofocusing, hMG displayed five immunoreactive follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) isohormones and nine luteinizing hormone (LH) isohormones. The relative distribution of FSH, but not LH isohormones, was slightly but significantly different between the lots tested. These data indicate that significant differences exist in the ability of commercially available hMG to stimulate follicular development and ovulation. The biochemical basis for these differences in in vivo biopotency remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment course of a 31-year-old infertility patient due to PCO disease is presented. Because the patient failed to conceive after various treatment cycles with CC, she was subjected to a combined GnRHa/hMG/hCG therapy. After plasma E2 levels had reached 2400 pg/ml, three leading follicles, with diameters of 20 to 24 mm, were detected. Induction of ovulation was achieved by 10,000 IU hCG. The patient conceived and developed ovarian hyperstimulation. At 8 weeks of gestation, seven cystic structures were detected within the uterine cavity, five containing single embryos, and two with twin embryos. All nine embryos were vital, as evidenced by their heart beats. Embryo reduction was achieved by transabdominal puncture on three occasions. The three surviving fetuses were carried to the 34th week of gestation. After delivery by cesarean section, three healthy babies developed normally. This communication illustrates the complications that can be associated with ovulation induction in PCO disease: ovarian hyperstimulation, polyovulation, multiple conceptions, and their clinical management.\r"

  ".U": "88167588\r", 
  ".W": "We have investigated the mechanisms underlying prostaglandin inhibition of histamine-stimulated parietal cell function. Enzyme-dispersed canine parietal cells were enriched by elutriation. The accumulation of the weak base [14C]aminopyrine was used as an index of parietal cell function and cyclic adenosine monophosphate content was measured by radioimmunoassay. Step density gradients of the elutriator-enriched parietal cell fractions indicated that parietal cells accounted for the histamine stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and inhibition by the prostaglandin E analogue Enprostil. Pertussis toxin adenosine diphosphate-ribosylates a subunit with a molecular weight of 41,000, thereby inactivating the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein of adenylate cyclase. Pertussis toxin treatment of parietal cells in overnight suspension culture was used to determine if inhibitory guanosine triphosphate-binding protein mediated prostanoid inhibition. In control cultured cells, prostaglandin E2 and Enprostil markedly inhibited forskolin- and histamine-stimulated aminopyrine accumulation. In parietal cells treated with pertussis toxin (300 ng/ml) for 18 h, stimulation of parietal cell function by histamine, isobutylmethylxanthine, and forskolin was unaltered compared with control cells, whereas prostaglandin E2 and Enprostil inhibition was markedly reduced. In pertussis toxin-treated cells, histamine-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation was unaltered, whereas Enprostil inhibition of histamine-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate production was markedly reduced. Pertussis toxin treatment of membranes from control, but not from pertussis toxin-treated, cells induced the [32P]adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation of a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 41,000, presumably the alpha-subunit of inhibitory guanosine triphosphate-binding protein. We conclude that prostanoids inhibit parietal cell function by receptor-mediated interaction with the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein of adenylate cyclase.\r"

Accordingly, we studied the effect of nasogastric feedings on arterial oxygen tension in patients receiving nasogastric feedings. Eleven patients studied had heterogeneous symptomatic COPD with various requirements for either bronchodilators, oxygen, or ventilator support. Samples for arterial blood gas (ABG) determinations were drawn (first ABG value) at the time of interrupting continuous feedings (75 ml/hr) or just before a small bolus feeding (75 ml). A repeat ABG sample (second ABG value) was drawn 30 minutes later. There was a small but statistically significant difference between the first and second arterial oxygen tension values. This difference, however, was not clinically significant. Our preliminary results suggest that symptomatic COPD patients experience hypoxemia with nasogastric feedings.\r"

Both peptides induced more than 2-fold increases in urinary sodium, calcium, and magnesium excretion. Effective renal plasma flow was slightly reduced, glomerular filtration rate did not change, and renal filtration fraction increased during the ANP infusions. Plasma renin, angiotensin II, and aldosterone concentrations fell by about 50%. Arterial blood pressure and plasma catecholamines did not change. Hematocrit and serum albumin concentrations rose significantly. ANP effects on urinary electrolytes and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were sustained for over an hour after completion of the ANP infusions. The two peptides did not differ in their effects. These results are consistent with a physiological role for plasma ANP in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and demonstrate that minor N-terminal truncation of alpha hANP has little effect on its biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in plasma GH responses to GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) were assessed after dietary manipulations in obese and nonobese subjects to determine whether the impaired GH responsiveness to GHRH in obesity is the consequence of obesity per se or of altered food intake. The mean plasma GH response to GHRH in 10 obese subjects was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher after a 72-h fast than when they were eating their usual diet. Comparable increases were found when 6 of the subjects were studied after eating an 800 Cal/day diet for 6 weeks (P less than 0.05). Plasma glucose and insulin levels were lower and FFA levels higher after fasting, but not after the diet, compared to values on the usual diet. The mean plasma somatomedin-C (Sm-C) level was similar to that in nonobese subjects and was unaffected by dietary changes. The peak GH responses to GHRH before fasting were inversely correlated with plasma Sm-C levels (r = 0.64; P less than 0.05). Plasma GH responses to GHRH in normal weight subjects were also higher after fasting for 24 h (P less than 0.05) and 72 h (P less than 0.01) than after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose, insulin, and FFA changes were similar in the obese and normal weight subjects. Plasma Sm-C levels in the nonobese subjects were slightly lower after 72 h of fasting. We conclude that the increased plasma GH responsiveness to GHRH after fasting is not unique to obesity and is unlikely to reflect a reversal of the obesity-associated impairment of GH secretion. The increased plasma GH responsiveness to GHRH after as little as 24 h of fasting suggests that it is a consequence of acute nutrient deprivation rather than weight loss. The enhanced responses in obese subjects after 6 weeks of food restriction, in contrast, are probably a consequence of weight reduction.\r"

During the MLP, 10 women received 3 mg/kg RU486 for 3 days. During the LLP, a single dose of 600 mg RU486 was administered to 4 women, and in another 4 women a single dose of 3 mg/kg was given during corpus luteum rescue by hCG. Longitudinal studies with daily and frequent blood samples (every 10 min for 10 h) were conducted during 3 consecutive cycles (control-treatment-recovery). During the MLP, RU486-induced uterine bleeding occurred in all 10 women 36-72 h after the first dose. No histological evidence of endometrial breakdown was found in endometrial biopsies taken 12-24 h before the onset of bleeding. Significant decreases in LH secretion (P less than 0.001) and LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.006) and blunted pituitary responses to GnRH (P less than 0.01) were evident by the last treatment day, but LH pulse frequency did not change. Complete luteolysis occurred in 2 of the 10 women. Incomplete luteolysis occurred in 8 women and was associated with an initial decline of serum estradiol (P less than 0.001), but not progesterone levels, followed by rebound increases (P less than 0.001) in LH, estradiol, and progesterone levels 3 days later, which may have reversed the luteolytic processes and prolonged corpus luteum function. Spontaneous luteolysis ensued 3-5 days later with the onset of second episodes of uterine bleeding. For serum FSH, an early rise occurred during the luteal phase in advance of the onset of the second episodes of uterine bleeding. This rise may have resulted in early follicle recruitment and accounted for the shorter duration of the follicular phase during recovery cycles. During the LLP, the single RU486 dose resulted in significant decreases in LH pulse amplitude (P less than 0.03), frequency (P less than 0.05), and secretion (not significant) within 12 h. The recovery cycle was entirely normal. Corpus luteum rescue with incremental doses of hCG did not prevent uterine bleeding after RU486 treatment. These findings indicate that RU486 operates at multiple sites and implies that progesterone is important in the control of luteal function. Further, our data provide a basis for exploring the potential use of RU486 as a once a month birth control agent.\r"

Two patients were treated for hypothyroidism inappropriately, and one underwent unnecessary diagnostic testing. Immunoaffinity chromatography of serum from one patient indicated that the serum TSH level was truly low. Addition of mouse serum or immunoglobulin G (IgG) or absorption of patient serum with solid phase-bound mouse IgG-1 reduced the TSH content in the serum of the three patients to undetectable levels. Blocking studies revealed that all patients had antibodies directed at mouse IgG-1, the subclass of mouse antibody present in the assay kit. The serum of one patient who had autoimmune disease with elevated serum Igs had much broader species cross-reactivity than that of another patient who had known exposure to rats and mice. We hypothesize that such antimouse antibodies can arise either from endogenous autoimmunity or exogenous animal exposure. Serum TSH elevations also were found when the serum samples were tested in other mouse monoclonal immunoassays, underscoring the fact that antibody interference can potentially affect many assays used in endocrinology and other areas of medicine to make major diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Clinicians must be aware of such interactions; relatively simple laboratory maneuvers can differentiate true from false results in assays of this type.\r"

  ".W": "According to the 2-cell theory, ovarian steroidogenesis requires the coordinate action of both FSH and LH. To evaluate the relative importance of these hormones in follicular maturation, a randomized cross-over study was performed in 10 women with complete gonadotropin deficiency (absence of pulsatile LH secretion and no LH response to LHRH). Five women were treated with highly purified FSH (LH bioactivity, 0.09%) and 3 months later with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG; LH bioactivity, 65%), each given for 10 days at a daily dose of 225 IU FSH, im. The sequence was reversed in the other 5 women. hCG (5000 IU) was administered im 24 h after the last injection of FSH or hMG. Plasma estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), androstenedione (A), testosterone, LH, and FSH concentrations and urinary LH and FSH were measured daily by RIA. Ultrasonography was performed during each treatment and 2 days after each hCG injection. After FSH treatment, mean plasma and urinary FSH levels increased, mean plasma LH did not change, and urinary LH increased slightly but not significantly from 91 +/- 32 (SE) to 164 +/- 55 mIU/24 h (10(-3) IU/24 h). After hMG treatment, mean plasma and urinary LH and FSH levels increased accordingly. The mean basal plasma E2 [11 +/- 1 pg/mL (40 +/- 4 pmol/L)] and E1 [14 +/- 4 pg/mL (52 +/- 15 pmol/L)] levels increased after FSH treatment to 207 +/- 69 pg/mL (760 +/- 253 pmol/L) and 82 +/- 21 pg/mL (303 +/- 78 pmol/L), respectively (P less than 0.01), but plasma A did not change. In response to hMG, the mean plasma E2, E1, A, and testosterone levels increased more than during FSH treatment. Ultrasonography revealed multiple preovulatory follicles (greater than or equal to 16 mm) in 2 women after hMG and 1 woman after FSH treatment; therefore, hCG was not administered. In 3 women given FSH, hCG did not induce ovulation. hCG induced ovulation in 8 women given hMG and in 6 women given FSH, based on ultrasonography and plasma progesterone levels. Thus, in the presence of profound gonadotropin deficiency pharmacological doses of FSH, with minute LH contamination, are capable of stimulating ovarian follicular maturation, underlining the key role of FSH in folliculogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "88169942\r", 
  ".W": "The in vitro characteristics of iodide and cAMP metabolism have been compared in tissues from autonomously functioning thyroid nodules and their quiescent counterpart to test the hypothesis that autonomy may result from constitutive activation of the tissue's TSH, cAMP, and protein phosphorylation regulatory axis, as in vivo nodular tissue took up more iodide. This effect was entirely due to increased transport capacity, the affinity of iodide transport, and the fractional binding of iodide to protein remaining unchanged. However, at high concentrations total iodide binding to protein was similar in quiescent and nodular tissue. In both tissues, this metabolic step was enhanced by phorbol esters and the ionophore A23187. As evaluated by autoradiography of two-dimensional gel protein electrophoregrams, no differences in the patterns of protein synthesis or phosphorylation between quiescent and nodular tissue were found. Basal cAMP levels were similar in quiescent and nodular tissue. The cAMP response to TSH was lower in nodular tissue, with no change in sensitivity or kinetics; both tissues responded to forskolin. No systematic suppression of iodide inhibition or abnormal responses to other hormones or neurotransmitters were found. Three proteins (24K-1, 24K-2, and 26K) were phosphorylated only in the presence of TSH or forskolin in both quiescent and nodular tissue. One protein substrate (20K) was phosphorylated in the presence of TSH in the quiescent, but not in the nodular, tissue. In conclusion, 1) slices from autonomous thyroid nodules reproduce the in vivo characteristics of the lesion and are, therefore, a suitable in vitro experimental model for biochemical studies; 2) taken together with data from transplantation experiments, the reproduction in vitro or its in vivo characteristics suggest an inherent defect in the nodule; 3) the homogeneity of biochemical findings within each nodule is compatible with the clonality of the lesion; 4) the autonomous nodule is a minimal deviation tumor; and 5) the characteristics of the TSH, cAMP, protein phosphorylation cascade are qualitatively normal, and autonomy does not result from constitutive activation of this system; and 6) a 20K protein, not phosphorylated in response to TSH in the nodule, could represent an absent negative controlling element.\r"

Urinary glucose excretion decreased from 48 +/- 19 g/day before treatment to 20 +/- 9 g/day at the end of glyburide treatment and 2 +/- 1 g/day at the end of insulin treatment. Neither treatment affected mean postabsorptive resting metabolic rate (untreated 4.86 +/- 0.50 kJ/min; glyburide-treated, 4.63 +/- 0.45 kJ/min; insulin-treated, 4.70 +/- 0.46 kJ/min) or postprandial resting metabolic rate (untreated, 5.71 +/- 0.55 kJ/min; glyburide-treated, 5.60 +/- 0.39 kJ/min; insulin-treated, 5.70 +/- 0.51 kJ/min). However, the two patients with the largest decreases in urinary glucose excretion also had decreases in energy expenditure. These data indicate that many obese type II diabetic patients could have significant weight gain from reduced energy losses alone.\r"

The effects of feeding on GHRH-induced GH release were studied in 13 normal women, 14 obese women, and 9 women with anorexia nervosa. GHRH-(1-44) (50 micrograms, iv) was administered at 0900 h after an overnight fast or at 1300 h after a normal meal at 0800 h, and at the same times 45 min after a 800-Cal meal on different days. The mean peak plasma GH responses to GHRH administered before a meal at 0900 h were 52.8 +/- 5.6 (+/- SE) micrograms/L in normal women, 8.2 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L in obese women, and 53.2 +/- 7.7 micrograms/L in anorexic women. When GHRH was administered before a meal at 1300 h, the mean peak plasma GH levels were lower than those at 0900 h; this reduction was -64.2% in normal women, -64.9% in obese women, and -55.8% in women with anorexia nervosa. After feeding, the plasma GH responses to GHRH were blunted in normal women at 0900 h (-60.9%) and 1300 h (-34.6%) compared with the fasting peak responses. In obese women the plasma GH response to GHRH after feeding was increased compared with that when these women had fasted (+60% at 0900 h and +406.9% at 1300 h). Finally, differential effects of feeding were present in anorexic women; the response was lower at 0900 h (-46.4%) and greater at 1300 h (+50.8%). We conclude that there is an ultradian variation in GHRH-stimulated GH secretion and that the responses differ according to nutritional status and body weight.\r"

Antibodies raised in rabbits against a rat ANF N-terminal fragment [ANF-(11-37)] had 100% cross-reactivity with human ANF-(1-30) and purified plasma N-terminal ANF immunoreactivity. The ED80 and ED50 of standard curves prepared using [125I]human ANF-(1-30) and human ANF-(1-30) were 31.5 +/- 5.4 (+/- SD) and 132.5 +/- 20.4 fmol/tube, respectively. The plasma ANF N-terminal peptide concentrations were assayed directly, without extraction, since dilution of plasma and addition of standard to plasma yielded parallel dose-responses in the RIA and virtually 100% recovery of ANF-(1-30) added to plasma. Purification of ANF N-terminal immunoreactivity from 1.5 L human plasma by affinity chromatography and amino acid sequencing suggested that it was closely related to ANF-(1-98), although some degraded peptides were also detected. The mean basal plasma ANF N-terminal peptide level measured in 34 normal subjects was 420 +/- 157 (+/- SD) pmol/L. The values were higher in plasma from patients with congestive heart failure (grades III and IV; 7,041 +/- 6,136 pmol/L; n = 13) or chronic renal failure (10,079 +/- 4,942 pmol/L; n = 20). In 9 patients with chronic renal failure, hemodialysis resulted in a 30% (P less than 0.05) decrease in plasma ANF-(99-126) levels, from 34.7 +/- 12.3 (+/- SD) to 23.2 + 6.1 pmol/L, but no changes in plasma ANF N-terminal peptide concentrations. These data indicate that the N-terminal portion of pro-ANF is cosecreted with ANF-(99-126). Its higher plasma levels in the basal state and during chronic renal failure suggest a different process of elimination than that of ANF-(99-126), which may be partly mediated by the kidney.\r"

Only one of the two patients who did not respond to GHRH had an improvement in linear growth when they were subsequently treated with synthetic GH. The other patient, a 16.5-yr-old pubertal girl who had both satisfactory GH and somatomedin-C responses during GHRH therapy, did not respond to either GHRH or, later, synthetic GH. The pretreatment serum GH response to iv GHRH, the serum somatomedin-C concentrations, and the peak serum GH response during sc GHRH therapy were not reliable predictors of clinical response.\r"

  ".W": "Atriopeptin (AP), a natriuretic-diuretic and vasodilatory peptide, is synthesized and secreted from mammalian atria. The definitive role of this peptide on cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology has yet to be determined. We developed a population of autoimmune rats sensitized against their own AP to evaluate the consequences of prolonged AP deficiency on physiological and pathophysiological processes. Natriuresis in response to acute intravenous volume expansion was inhibited in the autoimmune rat, however, natriuresis produced by chronic oral salt loading was not suppressed in these animals. Plasma AP increased threefold in the spontaneously hypertensive rat when evaluated as a function of blood pressure. Immunization of these rats had no effect on the rate of development, magnitude of their developing hypertension, or their daily sodium excretion when compared with nonimmunized controls. Mineralocorticoid escape occurred during desoxycorticosterone acetate administration to rats. The ability of rats to escape from the sodium-retaining effects of this steroid was not affected by prior immunization against AP. These results suggest that AP is an important natriuretic substance in response to acute intravascular volume loading. However, atriopeptin does not appear to be involved in the natriuretic response to chronic intravascular volume loading, blood pressure regulation, or mineralocorticoid escape.\r"

  ".W": "We have used high-pressure freezing techniques to study exocytosis in rat anterior pituitary cells. The cells were either unstimulated or exposed to 1 nM growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) for 10 min before ultrarapid freezing. The magnitude of growth hormone (GH) release was then correlated with the number of exocytotic events observed with freeze-fracture electron microscopy. High-pressure freezing of unfixed and uncryoprotected specimens permits cryofixation of samples up to 1 mm diam (0.5 mm thick) without ice crystal damage, and arrests exocytotic events within 10 ms. Our studies comparing conventionally fixed specimens with those prepared by high-pressure freezing confirm that areas of intramembrane particle clearing at potential exocytotic sites are an artifact of conventional fixation and/or cryoprotection techniques. The cells exposed to 1 nM GRF released approximately fivefold more GH than did unstimulated cells. Morphologically, we have observed a 3.3-fold increase in the number of exocytotic events in GRF-stimulated cells, 33.7 events/100 micron2 compared with 10.4 events/100 micron2 for unstimulated cells. In additional experiments, we studied the effects of two inhibitors of GRF-induced exocytosis, somatostatin and sodium isethionate. Both compounds elicit the same response, a parallel decrease in exocytotic events and in secreted product. We conclude that high-pressure freezing, combined with freeze-fracture and freeze-substitution processing techniques, is an excellent tool for studying the morphological aspects of exocytosis. In the present investigation, it has allowed us to quantitatively relate the biochemistry and morphology of exocytosis in anterior pituitary cells.\r"

Stimulated cell cultures from each individual were also examined for proliferative ability, expression of membrane IL2R, membrane IL2R density, and for the amount of IL2R shed into the culture supernatant. Induction of IL2 and IL2R mRNAs were decreased in cells from elderly individuals, as were the levels of IL2 secretion, the percentage of IL2R+ T cells and the density of membrane IL2R per cell. The results suggest that decreased expression of both IL2 and IL2R mRNA contributes to the low synthesis of IL2 and membrane IL2R, respectively, and is partially responsible for the diminished proliferative activity observed in lymphocytes from the elderly.\r"

The objective of the present investigation was to examine the role of VIP in IAS relaxation in response to the rectoanal reflex in intact opossums with the use of VIP antagonists, [4CI-D-Phe6,Leu17] VIP and (N-AC-Tyr1,D-Phe2)-GRF (1-29)-NH2. Intraluminal pressures from the sphincter were monitored using low-compliance, continuously perfused catheters. VIP and the antagonists were administered close-intraarterially. The responses to VIP, rectoanal reflex, sacral nerve stimulation, and local intramural stimulation were examined before and after the VIP antagonists. The present studies in intact animals show: (a) VIP causes a dose-dependent fall in the IAS pressures by a direct action at the IAS smooth muscle; (b) VIP antagonists selectively and significantly antagonized the inhibitory action of VIP; and (c) VIP antagonists caused significant antagonism of the IAS relaxation caused by rectoanal reflex and the other neural stimuli. The antagonism of the IAS relaxation by the VIP antagonists, depending upon the volume of rectal distension used, ranged from 40% to 62% (P less than 0.05). From these results, we conclude that VIP acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter for IAS relaxation during the rectoanal reflex.\r"

  ".W": "The cause of the abnormal active cation transport in erythrocytes of some uremic patients is unknown. In isolated adipocytes and skeletal muscle from chronically uremic chronic renal failure rats, basal sodium pump activity was decreased by 36 and 30%, and intracellular sodium was increased by 90 and 50%, respectively, compared with pair-fed control rats; insulin-stimulated sodium pump activity was preserved in both tissues. Lower basal NaK-ATPase activity in adipocytes was due to a proportionate decline in [3H]ouabain binding, while in muscle, [3H]ouabain binding was not changed, indicating that the NaK-ATPase turnover rate was decreased. Normal muscle, but not normal adipocytes, acquired defective Na pump activity when incubated in uremic sera. Thus, the mechanism for defective active cation transport in CRF is multifactorial and tissue specific. Sodium-dependent amino acid transport in adipocytes closely paralleled diminished Na pump activity (r = 0.91), indicating the importance of this defect to abnormal cellular metabolism in uremia.\r"

Both activities were found to be an exclusive property of lymphocytes expressing type 3 complement receptors (CR3) identified by anti-CD11 monoclonal antibodies. CD11+ lymphocytes were then fractionated into three subsets by two-color flow cytometry. These included CD16+ cells, which display distinctive Fc receptors for IgG (CD16). Using anti-CD5, the CD11+ CD16- lymphocytes were separated into non-T cell and T cell subsets. The two non-T cell subsets (CD11+ CD16+ and CD11+ CD16- CD5-), but not the T cell subset (CD11+ CD16- CD5+), could proliferate in response to IL-2. Both CD11+ non-T cell subsets, but not the CD11+ T cell subset, had the capacity to mediate natural killer cell activity. However, all three CD11+ lymphocyte subsets were capable of generating LAK activity. These findings are consistent with the concept that two signals are required to stimulate T cells to proliferate. However, at least a small subset of blood T cells can be activated by IL-2 to become LAK cells.\r"

Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a rate of 15-30 micrograms/kg per min for 30 or 60 min in eight dogs induced coronary artery reperfusion within 23 +/- 7 min (mean +/- SD), but reocclusion occurred despite heparin anticoagulation in all but one of these dogs within 7 +/- 5 min. Intravenous injection of 0.8 mg/kg of the F(ab')2 fragment of a monoclonal antibody (7E3) directed against the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor, prevented reocclusion in 10/10 dogs during an observation period of 2 h (P less than 0.001 vs. rt-PA alone). The antibody abolished ADP-induced platelet aggregation and markedly prolonged the bleeding time. Intravenous aspirin or dipyridamole prevented reocclusion for 1 h or more in only 2/7 and 1/6 dogs, respectively. We conclude that the monoclonal antibody is very effective in preventing reocclusion after successful thrombolysis of occluded coronary arteries with rt-PA.\r"

Second, hearts from rats fed tungsten or treated with allopurinol had negligible XO activities (less than 0.5 mU/g wet myocardium compared with greater than 6.0 mU/g in control hearts) and increased ventricular function after ischemia and reperfusion.

  ".U": "88170066\r", 
  ".W": "Studies in man have shown that the episodic release of growth hormone (GH) is infrequent and erratic, and unlike that in the rat does not appear to have discernible ultradian periodicities. However, these observations in nonfasted subjects may be invalid since mixed nutrients have unpredictable effects on GH release. Moreover, in the fed state basal GH levels are frequently undetectable, thus rendering the identification of low amplitude pulses unreliable. Accordingly, the 24-h pulsatile pattern of GH secretion obtained from repetitive venous sampling in six normal adult male subjects was examined during a control fed day and during the first and fifth days of a 5-d fast. The GH data were analyzed using two distinct methods: a discrete pulse detection algorithm (Cluster analysis) and Fourier expansion time-series, which allows fixed periodicities of secretory activity to be resolved. The 5-d fast resulted in a significant increase in discrete GH pulse frequency (5.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.9 +/- 0.7 pulses/24 h, P = 0.028), 24 h integrated GH concentration (2.82 +/- 0.50 vs. 8.75 +/- 0.82 micrograms.min/ml; P = 0.0002), and maximal pulse amplitude (5.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 12.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml, P less than 0.005). While multiple low-amplitude sinusoidal periodicities were present on the control fed day, time-series analysis revealed enhancement of circadian and ultradian cycles on the first and fifth days of fasting. Concomitantly, fasting resulted in a decline (day 1 vs. day 5) in serum concentrations of somatomedin C (1.31 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.77 +/- 0.18 U/ml) and glucose (4.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter), and a marked rise in free fatty acid (0.43 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.55 +/- 0.35 mmol/liter) and acetoacetate (35 +/- 6 vs. 507 +/- 80 nmol/liter). We conclude that the acute nutritional status is an important determinant of spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion in man. Fast-induced enhancement of GH release is achieved through combined frequency (discrete pulses) and amplitude (sinusoidal periodicities) modulation. Such alterations in somatotropic hormone release may play an important role in substrate homeostasis during starvation.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo PTH administration to rats resulted in increased brain synaptosomal Ca++ transport, while parathyroidectomy (PTX) resulted in decreased transport. To determine the mechanism of action of PTH on Ca++ transport in rat brain synaptosomes, we performed transport studies by the Na-Ca exchanger and also measured cAMP generation in synaptosomes from PTX rats. Ca++ transport was studied after in vivo additions of either bovine (b)PTH, cAMP, or forskolin, and adenylate cyclase activity was assessed after additions of either bPTH, forskolin, sodium fluoride (NaF), or isoproterenol. In the presence of 1-34 bPTH [10(-7) M], Ca++ uptake was significantly increased by 55% (P less than 0.001) above control, while 3-34 bPTH [10(-7) M] had no effect on uptake. Both 8br,cAMP [10(-6) M] and dibut,cAMP [10(-6) M] also significantly increased (P less than 0.001) Ca++ uptake above control by 63 and 44%, respectively. Similarly, forskolin [10(-5) M], the adenylate cyclase activator, increased Ca++ uptake by 41%. We next evaluated Ca++ efflux, and found that 1-34 bPTH [10(-7) M], 1-84 bPTH [10(-7) M], and forskolin [10(-5) M] also increased Ca++ efflux by 50, 73, and 120%, respectively, above control. Since Ca++ transport was increased by either PTH, cAMP, or forskolin, we decided to determine if PTH action on Ca++ transport in synaptosomes was dependent on cAMP. This was investigated by measuring cAMP production during the conversion of 32P-ATP to 32P-cAMP in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (30 micrograms creatine phosphokinase, 10 mM creatine phosphate), and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor (1 mM IBMX). Whereas forskolin [10(-4) M] and NaF [100 mM] significantly increased (P less than 0.001) adenylate cyclase activity in synaptosomes by eight- and fourfold, respectively, neither 1-34 bPTH nor 1-84 bPTH increased synaptosomal cyclase activity. However, in canine renal cortical plasma membranes (CRCPM), we observed significant increases in cAMP production with either forskolin, NaF, or PTH. Finally, to determine if synaptosomes contain an intact adenylate cyclase system, we measured cAMP production in the presence of the beta adrenergic agent, isoproterenol. Isoproterenol significantly increased adenylate cyclase activity in both synaptosomes (90%) and CRCPM (50%). These data suggest that although there is an intact adenylate cyclase system in rat brain synaptosomes, PTH-stimulated calcium transport in synaptosomes appears to be independent of this system.\r"

Each patient and control received a single intravenous dose of 100 micrograms gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), and one week later, 10 U/kg body weight of human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) to stimulate ovarian function. The patients had decreased gonadotrophin reserves when compared with those of normal controls, only one of 23 patients had an intact luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone response. Most of the thalassaemic patients with delayed puberty showed normal gonad response to human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), but three had very low responses, when compared with that of controls. The gonadal failure was even more severe in four of six patients with primary amenorrhoea. It is important to assess hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function in young women with beta thalassaemia major, so that those with glandular dysfunction may be started on replacement therapy.\r"

This study focused primarily on information available early in the hospitalization phase. Data were available for 243 patients who received the full dose of rt-PA and who had assessable coronary angiograms 90 min after the start of the intravenous infusion. The infarct-related vessel was scored by an independent assessment committee as being patent in 65% of patients. The left anterior descending coronary artery was involved in 53% of patients, and proximal localization of the infarct-related vessel occurred in 65%. In the majority of patients (85%), the infusion was started within 4 h of the acute event. Neither the angiographic location of the infarct-related vessel nor electrocardiographic evidence of infarct severity or location appeared to have a bearing on thrombolysis with rt-PA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent predictors of coronary patency: hematocrit 43 to 47%, blood plasminogen level greater than or equal to 90% of normal and serum alkaline phosphatase greater than or equal to 82% of the local upper normal limit. In addition, the use of intravenous nitrates suggests a positive association with patency.\r"

The majority of patients (90%) received high dose intravenous thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase in addition to angioplasty. Similar follow-up data were obtained in 206 (90%) of 228 consecutive patients who had successful elective angioplasty during the same period. The interval from angioplasty to follow-up was 28 +/- 9 weeks for the myocardial infarction group and 30 +/- 11 weeks for the elective group. Baseline clinical variables were similar for both the myocardial infarction and elective groups except for a higher percentage of men in the infarction group (81 versus 63%, p = 0.001). The number of coronary lesions undergoing angioplasty and the incidence of intimal dissection were similar, but multivessel angioplasty was more common in the elective group (13 versus 4%, p = 0.02). The rate of in-hospital reocclusion was higher in the patients receiving angioplasty for myocardial infarction (13 versus 2%, p = 0.0001). At the time of late follow-up after hospital discharge, the patients with myocardial infarction were more often asymptomatic (79 versus 55%, p = 0.0001), and the rate of angiographic coronary restenosis was lower for the infarction group both overall (19 versus 35%, p = 0.006) and when multivessel angioplasty patients were excluded (19 versus 33%, p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The feeding regimen is designed to allow for adaptive increases in digestive enzymes and digestive surface area within the gut. Small advances in volume are made first; increases in concentration of the formula follow.

Others suggest that these thyroid hormone alterations were secondary to associated disorders rather than old age, and questioned the \"healthy\" status of the subjects studied in the earlier reports. Therefore, to assess the possible effect of aging we studied T3 resin uptake, T4, free T4, T3, and rT3 concentrations in 152 euthyroid healthy adult subjects. These subjects were selected carefully and were therefore devoid of any illness, acute or chronic, and were not treated with any medications at the time of study. No significant alterations were noted in any of the thyroid hormone concentrations in subjects divided into groups according to age. Nor was there a significant difference in these parameters between men and women of any individual age group or for all ages combined. Therefore, old age per se may not influence thyroid hormone metabolism and hence may not induce changes in serum thyroid hormone concentrations. The changes in thyroid hormones noted previously in elderly subjects may be a reflection of concurrent disorders and not old age.\r"

  ".W": "rIFN-gamma strikingly enhances the secretion of IgG2a by murine splenic B cells stimulated with bacterial LPS in vitro and concomitantly suppresses the production of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE while sparing IgM secretion. IFN-gamma stimulates highly purified B cell populations to secrete IgG2a, strongly suggesting that it acts directly on B cells. It increases the frequency of precursors of IgG2a-expressing soft agar colonies and enhances the number of IgG2a+ cells in colonies indicating that it both increases the frequency of precursors of IgG2a+ cells and enhances the number of IgG2a+ daughter cells emerging from each precursor. IFN-gamma completes its action within the first 24 to 48 h of a 6-day culture with LPS and its addition cannot be delayed beyond the first 48 h. Preincubation of resting B cells in the presence of IFN-gamma leads to a time dependent increase, up to 42 h, in IgG2a secretion upon subsequent addition of LPS. IFN-gamma can exert this action on resting B cells that have been selected for absence of membrane IgG expression by cell sorting. The promotion of IgG2a secretion appears to be a specific property of IFN-gamma in that IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, granulocyte-CSF, and CSF-1 fail to enhance IgG2a secretion by LPS-stimulated B cells.\r"

In contrast, anti-2H1 did not react with B cells, macrophages, null cells, or hematopoietic stem cell lines. More importantly, anti-2H1 antibody can induce T cell activation and proliferation in synergy with PMA or anti-T11(3). SDS-PAGE analysis of polypeptides immunoprecipitated with anti-2H1 showed two major polypeptides of 140 and 105 kDa. Thus, the 2H1 Ag can be distinguished from T3, T11, and 9.3 Ag.

  ".W": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP), a nine-amino acid neurohypophyseal hormone, is capable of replacing the helper cell requirement for IFN-gamma production by Lyt-2+ mouse splenic lymphocytes. We present data here showing that the AVP helper signal occurs via interaction with a novel R on splenic lymphocytes and involves primarily the N-terminal six-amino acid cyclic ring (pressinoic acid) with the C-terminal three-amino acid end of AVP playing a minor role. Pressinoic acid was capable of providing help at concentrations similar to those of AVP, whereas oxytocin and isoleucine pressinoic acid were 10- and 100-fold less effective, respectively. Isoleucine pressinoic acid has the same structure as pressinoic acid except for the substitution of isoleucine for phenylalanine in position 3 of the sequence. Consistent with the function data, R binding competitions with splenic lymphocyte membrane preparations showed that AVP and pressinoic acid competed similarly with [3H]AVP, whereas oxytocin and isoleucine pressinoic acid were much less effective competitors. Further characterization of the AVP lymphocyte R was performed using AVP analogues having well defined agonist and antagonist activities on either V1 (vasopressor) R or V2 (antidiuretic) R. The AVP helper signal was blocked by the V1 antagonist [d(CH2)1(5) Tyr(methyl)]AVP but not by another V1 antagonist, [d(CH2)1(5)D-Tyr(ethyl)2Val4]AVP. Both V1-R antagonists were able to block [3H]AVP binding to the V1-R on liver cells, whereas only the V1 antagonist that blocked AVP help was able to compete effectively for the spleen AVP-R. Neither a V2 agonist nor a V2 antagonist had any effect on AVP help in IFN-gamma production. These data strongly indicate the presence of a novel AVP-R on spleen lymphocytes, which is related to the classic V1-R on liver cell membranes.\r"

Granulomas induced by i.v. embolization of Schistosoma mansoni eggs (hypersensitivity type) or Sephadex beads (foreign body type) both caused reduced NK activity, although hypersensitivity granulomas induced a significantly higher level of NK suppression. Kinetic analysis of hypersensitivity lesions at 4, 8, 16, and 32 days post-embolization indicated that NK activity was significantly suppressed by day 8, maximally suppressed by day 16 (at the peak of the inflammatory response) then returned to near control values by day 32 (as the granulomas resolved). Suppression of NK activity ranged from three- to 15-fold in different experiments. NK cells obtained from both spleen and peripheral blood demonstrated reduced NK activity with kinetic patterns similar to the granuloma NK cells. Suppression was not due to reduced splenic NK cells as the frequency of YAC-1 binding cells, as well as asialo GM1+ or laminin+ cells remained constant over the entire study period. Suppression of NK activity did not appear to be due to serum components or suppressor cells present in the spleen preparations. However, the suppression of NK activity could be reversed by overnight incubation of spleen cells at 25 or 37 degrees C or daily treatment of the mice with indomethacin. Suppression also appeared relatively specific for NK cells as the generation and expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was not affected.\r"

  ".W": "IL-2R on activated lymphocytes contain the Tac protein. As part of an effort to characterize this molecule, we examined the structure-activity relationship for each of its 12 Cys residues. A preliminary map of intramolecular disulfide bonding was derived by analysis of cystine-linked enzymatic fragments of the Tac protein. The results indicated that disulfide bonds linked Cys-3 with Cys-147, Cys-131 with Cys-163, and Cys-28,30 with Cys-59,61. The contribution of the Cys residues to an active protein conformation was tested by site-specific mutagenesis, followed by expression of the modified molecules in murine L cells. The results indicated that Cys-192 and -225 could be replaced without affecting ligand binding. In contrast, modification of any of the other 10 Cys residues, either singly or in combinations corresponding to the predicted disulfide bonds, greatly reduced the ability of the corresponding protein to bind IL-2 or either of two mAb (anti-Tac and 7G7/B6) which recognize the Tac protein. Each of the latter mutations also interfered with the molecule's post-translational modification and cell-surface expression. Consistent with these findings, transfection of the L cells with vectors containing truncated Tac cDNA inserts resulted in secretion of Tac fragments capable of ligand binding when the polypeptide chains terminated after Cys-163 (the 10th Cys residue in the full length molecule), but resulted in inactive fragments of Tac which were poorly secreted when they terminated before Cys-163. These findings emphasize the remarkable sensitivity of the active conformation of the Tac molecule to each of the postulated intramolecular disulfide bonds.\r"

Amino acid sequence of human IL-3 deduced from DNA sequence of these cDNA clones agrees with that predicted from genomic sequence except at amino acid position 27. Northern blotting analysis and S1 nuclease analysis show that almost all activated T cell clones express IL-3 mRNA with kinetics similar to that observed in mouse T cell clones. However, striking difference was found in the level of granulocyte-macrophage-CSF and IL-3 mRNA expressed in activated human T cells. In contrast to mouse T cell clones, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF mRNA is expressed at least two orders of magnitude more abundant than IL-3 mRNA. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying human IL-3 cDNA fused downstream to alpha-factor leader sequence expressed and secreted biologically active IL-3. Several different rat anti-peptide antisera have been used to confirm the presence of human rIL-3 immunochemically. The immunoreactive human IL-3 expressed in transiently transfected COS7 cells or in yeast was observed to be heterogeneous. Human rIL-3 expressed in COS7 cells has multipotential CSF activity in semisolid cultures of bone marrow cells, and selectively induced the proliferation of My-10+ marrow or cord blood cells in liquid cultures.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid hormones, although able to exert profound immunosuppressive effects, do not suppress mononuclear phagocyte activation by IFN-gamma and may even enhance it. For example, expression and functional activity of the high affinity FcR for IgG on human mononuclear phagocytes (FcR gamma I) is increased by IFN-gamma and is maximal after co-treatment with IFN-gamma plus the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX). To determine whether there are other mononuclear phagocyte surface Ag that are regulated in this manner, hybridomas were prepared using IFN-gamma-plus-DEX-treated human monocytes as immunogen. Five IgG1 mAb (Mac 2-8, 2-38, 2-48, 2-49, and 2-158) were developed that recognize a trypsin-sensitive mononuclear phagocyte-specific surface Ag of Mr 155,000. There was no detectable reactivity of these mAb to lymphocytes or granulocytes or to several cell lines, including U-937 and HL-60. The p155 Ag was detected on monocytes and increased significantly with time of culture or after treatment with DEX. Expression was maximal after co-treatment with rIFN-gamma plus DEX, but was inhibited or unaffected by treatment with IFN-gamma alone. For freshly isolated cells, expression of the p155 Ag was highest on peritoneal macrophages. Our results indicate that the p155 Ag is a newly identified Ag of the human mononuclear phagocyte lineage and may represent, in the least, a phenotypic marker of monocyte differentiation or maturation.\r"

Human b2m was reacted with FITC under mild conditions and separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography into three peaks containing single labeled derivatives of b2m peaks A, B, and C, and a peak containing the unmodified protein. The three fluorescent derivatives labeled the surfaces of cells bearing class I MHC Ag. The labeling was specific for class I MHC Ag as indicated by failure to label cells in the presence of excess unlabeled b2m and failure to label the HLA-negative cell lines Daudi and 721.221. Mouse cells labeled with fluorescent human b2m were recognized by mAb to the class I MHC Ag and by virus-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suggesting that labeling with the fluorescent b2m does not significantly alter the structure of class I MHC Ag or impair their ability to present viral antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. We determined the kinetic and equilibrium binding parameters for the fluorescent b2m derivatives associating with the class I H chains of mouse and human cells. Peaks B and C exhibited biphasic binding to the mouse lymphoma cells EL-4(G-CSA-) (Kd1 = 1 x 10(-9) M; K2 = 1.5 to 3.0 x 10(-8) M whereas peak A bound to a small number of low affinity binding sites. In contrast to the biphasic binding observed with EL-4(G-CSA-), only monophasic binding was observed for peak C binding to RDM4 cells. Biphasic binding was also observed with the human B cell line LCL 721. Analysis of a series of LCL 721 class I MHC loss mutants and gene transferents revealed that the heterogeneity in binding is due to differences in the affinity of different class I encoded H chains for b2m.\r"

  ".W": "Various murine macrophage populations synthesize and secrete large amounts of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) derived eicosanoids (cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase products). These metabolites are known to possess a wide variety of functions with regard to the initiation and regulation of inflammation and tumorigenesis. Because the dietary intake of 20:4n-6 is usually low, tissues are largely dependent upon dietary linoleic acid (18:2n-6) as an initial unsaturated precursor for the biosynthesis of 20:4n-6. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether resident or responsive murine macrophages possess desaturase and elongase activities capable of in vitro conversion of 18:2n-6 into 20:4n-6. Peritoneal exudate macrophages were purified by adherence and incubated in serum-free medium containing fatty acid-free BSA with [1-14C] 18:2n-6. Approximately 90 to 98% of the [14C]18:2n-6 at 4 and 16 h was recovered in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The metabolism of [14C]18:2n-6 was determined after transesterification and separation of the 14C-fatty acid methyl esters by argentation TLC, reverse phase HPLC, and electron impact gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resident and responsive macrophages lacked the capacity to transform [14C]18:2n-6 into 20:4n-6. In addition, prelabeled macrophages incubated with soluble, calcium ionophore A23187 or phorbol myristate, or particulate, zymosan, membrane perturbing agents also lacked delta 6 desaturase activity. All macrophages tested were capable of elongating [14C]18:2n-6 into [14C]20:2n-6. These observations suggest that 20:4n-6, present in macrophage phospholipids, is biosynthesized elsewhere and transported to the macrophage for esterification into the phospholipids. In addition, these findings demonstrate that elongase activity is present in both the resident and responsive peritoneal macrophage.\r"

Pulsed Bcgr spleen cells were shown to induce a stronger proliferation of the T cell-indicator system than their Bcgs counterparts. No difference in Ag-presenting ability could be shown between Bcgr and Bcgs peritoneal macrophages from normal animals. However, elicited peritoneal macrophages from immune Bcgr mice were superior in their Ag-presentation ability. Differences at the level of Ag presentation of Bcgr and Bcgs splenic cells were investigated further. Depletion of T cells and B cells did not alter the differences in Ag-presenting ability between Bcgr and Bcgs spleen cells. Furthermore, splenic dendritic cells of Bcgr or Bcgs allelic types were equally efficient in presenting bacillus Calmette-Guerin Ag to accessory cell-depleted T cells. In a final experiment, it was shown that spleen macrophages were the cell type involved in the superior Ag presentation by Bcgr splenic cells.\r"

  ".W": "We previously have shown that former patients and patients with active cases of schistosomiasis mansoni have T lymphocytes in their PBMC that proliferate when exposed to immunoaffinity-purified antibodies against Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA). These T cell anti-idiotypic responses required the participation of adherent cells, but the role of these cells in the response to the Id has been unclear. We now show that chloroquine does not interfere with Id-elicited stimulation of cells from former patients but completely inhibits their response to the SEA. F(ab')2 fragments of anti-SEA Id are stimulatory, and excess normal human IgG does not alter anti-Id responses. Soluble Id F(ab) fragments are not stimulatory, but rather inhibit stimulation by the intact Id from which they were made. Either intact Id or their F(ab')2 fragments can stimulate non-adherent T cells in the absence of adherent cells if an exogenous source of purified or recombinant human IL-1 is supplied. Nonstimulatory F(ab) fragments can stimulate nonadherent cells if they are bound first to Sepharose 4B and presented in conjunction with IL-1. Thus, T cells from former schistosomiasis patients can react with polyclonal anti-SEA-related Id directly. Under these conditions T cell proliferation requires receptor cross-linking and a source of IL-1 but does not require either \"processing\" of Id or MHC co-presentation.\r"

  ".W": "The tremendous diversity of the antibody specificity repertoire stems from the ability of each developing B cell to select one out of many possible variable, diversity, and joining gene segments by specific rearrangement of the DNA. The mechanism by which V region gene segments is selected is not known. Moreover, evidence for both random and nonrandom expression of VH genes in mature B cells has been presented previously. In this report, the technique of in situ hybridization is used to accurately measure at the single cell level VH gene family expression in LPS-induced cells from several strains. In this way, at least one-third of the B cells are stimulated and a large sampling of activated splenocytes from each strain analyzed. The use of in situ hybridization eliminates any potential biases resulting from transformation protocols. In addition, because all populations of cells are analyzed by both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical staining with anti-IgM, the proportion of cells detected by in situ hybridization could be compared with the proportion of B cells, blasts, and plasma cells in the population. It was concluded from these comparisons that the cells being detected by in situ hybridization under the conditions described are plasmablasts and plasma cells. Therefore, an accurate measure of the functional and expressed VH gene repertoire could be made. The results clearly demonstrate strain-dependent variation in VH gene family expression, particularly VH 7183 and VH J558 with up to three-fold differences observed. Thus, either there is considerable strain variation in the number of functional VH gene family segments or the expression of VH genes is not entirely random.\r"

The activity of prostaglandin D synthetase, which isomerizes prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2, was detected in the 100,000 g supernatant of the homogenate of adult rat skin. Whole skin showed considerable activity (1.9 nmol/min/mg protein), and prostaglandin D2 was the major prostaglandin among those formed from prostaglandin H2 in the presence of glutathione. The epidermis, which was separated from whole skin by heating (55 degrees C, 30 s), exhibited about three times higher activity (3.5) than the dermis (1.0). The enzymatic properties of both layers were similar; they were absolutely glutathione-dependent, were inhibited only a few percent by 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitro-benzene, and were completely absorbed by anti-rat spleen prostaglandin D synthetase antibody. Immunohistochemical studies, using anti-rat spleen prostaglandin D synthetase antibody and the immunoperoxidase method, showed that prostaglandin D synthetase was localized in Langerhans cells (not in keratinocytes) in the epidermis, in macrophages or histiocytes, and also in mast cells in the dermis. Immunoelectron microscopy also supported these findings. These results suggest that prostaglandin D2 is one of the most important arachidonic acid metabolites and plays a significant role in immunological function in the skin via Langerhans cells and macrophages.\r"

Whole blood cultures of 30 psoriatic patients showing moderate to severe disease activity and 21 cultures from healthy controls were stimulated with the mitogens PHA, ConA, and PWM, with PPD and Tetanus Antigen as IFN gamma inducers and with C. parvum, PolyI-PolyC, and Herpes simplex virus as inducers of IFN alpha. Interferon activity was tested in the supernatant of 48-h cultures by using an antiviral assay. Lymphoproliferation was assayed in 5-d cultures in parallel. Psoriatic patients showed a significantly decreased IFN production to all the stimuli tested. There were no significant differences in the lymphoproliferative responses; only the response to PWM was slightly decreased. The decreased IFN production by leukocytes from psoriatic patients seems to be very remarkable since increased susceptibility to infections is not generally known in these patients.\r"

No reaction was found with keratinocytes, lymphoid cells, fibroblasts, and nonmelanoma cell lines. The 5C12 antibody was used to affinity-purify tyrosinase directly from a cell lysate, giving a single protein of 60,000 daltons, electrophoretically identical with enzyme activity and immunoreactivity with 5C12 antibody. Treatment of melanoma cells with periodate significantly reduced antigenicity. It can be inferred from these results that 5C12 antibody is directed against a carbohydrate moiety present in active and inactive tyrosinase, and that amelanotic melanoma cells may contain significant levels of the latter protein.\r"

We examined alveolar macrophages from nonsmoking patients with sarcoidosis undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for evaluation of disease activity. We compared these cells with macrophages from smoking and nonsmoking control patients. The amount of hydrogen peroxide released by the macrophages either spontaneously or after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate was measured. The alveolar macrophages from smokers spontaneously released hydrogen peroxide, as we previously observed. The macrophages from the patients with sarcoidosis also released detectable amounts of hydrogen peroxide, but the macrophages from the non-smokers did not. Alveolar macrophages from all three groups released hydrogen peroxide when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. The macrophages from all three groups were examined for the presence on the surface membrane of beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that appears on the surface of older, activated macrophages. The macrophages in the BAL fluid of the patients with sarcoidosis had less beta-galactosidase staining than did those from the smokers, although they released comparable amounts of hydrogen peroxide. These findings suggest that alveolar macrophages in the BAL fluid of patients with sarcoidosis are younger, more monocyte-like, and activated by various factors, including gamma-interferon.\r"

MKN 28 monolayers and monolayers of human gastric epithelial cells from surgical specimens were studied morphologically and functionally. The protective effect of acetaminophen against taurocholate-induced damage was evaluated as was its effect on prostaglandin production. Both types of cultures showed similar morphologic and histochemical characteristics. Indomethacin inhibited and arachidonic acid stimulated prostaglandin production by both types of monolayers similarly. Both monolayers responded similarly to drug-induced damage. Acetaminophen decreased taurocholate-induced damage by 33% and 40% in MKN 28 cells and in primary human gastric cell culture, respectively. Indomethacin did not prevent acetaminophen protection nor did the amount of prostaglandin produced by cells increase after incubation with acetaminophen. In conclusion: (1) in the MKN 28 cell line model acetaminophen protected against taurocholate-induced damage; the percentage of protection was similar to that in primary cultures of human gastric epithelial cells; (2) acetaminophen protection in both models was not related to increased prostaglandin production; (3) the MKN 28 cell line is a suitable model to study damage to and protection of gastric epithelial cells in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the contractile effect of angiotensin II on isolated rat glomeruli and cultured glomerular mesangial cells, as well as the possible involvement of calcium in this contraction. In addition, the effect of rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on angiotensin II-induced contraction was studied. Computer-assisted image analysis was used to measure glomerular cross-sectional area and planar mesangial cell surface area in several experimental conditions. Angiotensin II induced a decrease in glomerular cross-sectional area and planar mesangial cell surface area that was both time and dose dependent. This effect was partially blocked by preincubation with verapamil or TMB-8, the latter compound being more effective. Incubation with ANP prevented angiotensin II-induced reduction of glomerular cross-sectional area and planar mesangial cell surface area and reversed contraction in mesangial cells. Incubation with TMB-8 impaired the effect of ANP. These data suggest that angiotensin II could exert part of its physiologic effects in the kidney through calcium-dependent mesangial and glomerular contraction. ANP inhibited this contraction, possibly explaining some of its renal effects.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of alcohol intake on the serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-ch), apoprotein A-I (apo A-I), and apoprotein A-II (apo A-II) was investigated in 15 habitual alcohol drinkers without liver injury (group A), 17 with mild hepatic damage (group B), and five with advanced liver disease (group C). The serum level of HDL-ch was higher in group A than in 10 nondrinkers (P less than 0.01) but lower in group B (P less than 0.05) and markedly lower in group C (P less than 0.01). The level of apo A-I was also higher in group A (P less than 0.05), although the level of apo A-II was not. To elucidate the effect of alcohol on apo A-I production by hepatocytes, the synthesis of apo A-I and albumin by cultured rat liver cells in the presence of ethanol was also investigated. Ethanol enhanced the production of apo A-I but not that of albumin. The results suggest that serum HDL is elevated in habitual alcohol drinkers without liver injury and that the elevation of HDL in blood is mainly dependent on the increase of apo A-I synthesis in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to determine an immunologically active regimen for the administration of recombinant gamma-interferon (rIFN-gamma). The patient population included patients with completely resected melanoma, stage I (Clark's level IV or V) or stage II. All patients exhibited no evidence of disease (NED) at the time of the study. Patients received rIFN-gamma by intramuscular (IM) injection daily for 15 days at 0.0001 mg/m2, 0.001 mg/m2, 0.01 mg/m2, 0.1 mg/m2 (ten patients/group), or 0.25 mg/m2 (five patients). Interferon (IFN) was well tolerated, with non-dose-limiting constitutional symptoms occurring in the majority of patients at 0.1 mg/m2 and 0.25 mg/m2. All five patients receiving 0.25 mg/m2 developed elevated transaminase levels, which led to a discontinuation of therapy in one patient. Immunological activity was assessed by serial measurements of natural killer (NK) cell activity, hydrogen peroxide production by monocytes, and changes in expression of Fc receptors and human leukocyte class II antigen (HLA-DR) on monocytes. These changes were determined at baseline (X2), six to seven time points during rIFN-gamma therapy, and two times after the last dose of rIFN-gamma. No changes were observed at the two lowest doses. At the 0.01 mg/m2 dose, all parameters were elevated but not as consistently nor to the same levels as seen following administration of 0.1 mg/m2. At 0.25 mg/m2, H2O2 production was enhanced, but unlike at 0.1 mg/m2, it declined during the last few days of IFN therapy. Subcutaneous (SC) administration was compared with IM administration using the 0.1 mg/m2 dose. SC administration resulted in enhanced H2O2 production and Fc receptor expression by monocytes. More consistent elevations in peroxide generation and higher levels of Fc receptor expression were seen following SC administration. No significant difference was found between the two routes of administration. A comparison of two schedules, daily and three times weekly, suggested that monocyte activation may return to normal 72 hours after IFN administration. Of the doses tested, 0.1 mg/m2 administered daily appeared to be the most effective biological response modifier (BRM) regimen, and because of ease of administration, we favor the SC route.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight patients with stage III ovarian carcinoma were treated with a protocol consisting of an initial phase of induction of remission with cyclophosphamide, hexamethylmelamine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CHAD) combination chemotherapy and a second laparotomy for resection of residual tumors, followed by a consolidation phase with curative doses of whole abdominal radiation. Six patients (16%) had stage IIIA disease, ten (26%) IIIB, and 22 (58%) had stage IIIC disease. All patients received three to 14 courses of CHAD chemotherapy with a clinical response rate (complete [CR] and partial [PR]) of 91%. Thirty-three patients underwent the second operation. In 14 patients no residual tumor was found, and in another 11 residual tumors found were totally resected. Thus, 25 of 33 (76%) were classified as in pathological complete remission (PCR) after this operation. Whole abdominal irradiation was well tolerated, although 12 of 29 (42%) of the irradiated patients required more than a 2-week interruption of the treatment course because of leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. The actuarial 5-year survival and disease-free survival rates for the whole group were 27% and 17%, respectively, and for the 29 patients who received the complete sequence of the prescribed protocol treatments, 35% and 20%, respectively. A univariate analysis of clinical parameters showed that inherent biological features, such as histology and grade, were the most dominant factors affecting prognosis, and that neither the aggressive surgical approach employed, nor the high-dose whole abdominal irradiation, significantly affected the outcome. The long-term results suggest that although our combined modality protocol was well tolerated, it failed to enhance the cure of stage III ovarian carcinoma. The possible biological and therapeutic vectors affecting this outcome are discussed.\r"

The study reported here was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using this technique in patients with lymphoid cell malignancy. Up to 22.7 MBq was administered to seven patients with active non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the spleen and the behavior of the radioactive material was followed over subsequent months. Estimates of the activity in peripheral blood, bone marrow, excreta samples, and of the variation in the whole-body distribution were obtained. The administered radioactive material cleared rapidly from the blood, 85% being removed within the first 30 min. There was an almost immediate uptake of most of this by the spleen and liver with less than 5% of administered activity accumulating in the bone marrow. After 48 hr, the whole-body distribution changed only slowly and there was a regular decrease of the activity in the spleen. Excretion of radioactive material occurred via both the urine and feces and amounted to less than 1% of administered activity per day. This pharmacokinetic data was used to calculate radiation absorbed doses to various organs for a standard man. It is concluded that this represents a feasible technique for the targeting of radioactive material for the treatment of lymphoid malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Feeding medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) is reported to result in less weight gain as fat than feeding long-chain triglycerides (LCT). In this experiment, fatty acid metabolism was studied in hepatocytes isolated from rats fed high fat diets containing MCT (70.9% of total energy), LCT (72.3% total energy) or a low fat (LF) (10.8% total energy). In the MCT group, hepatocyte utilization of [1-14C]oleate or [1-14C]octanoate, unlabeled ketone body (KB) production and lipogenesis (LG) were greater than in the other groups. Esterified products (EST) from both fatty acids were greater in the MCT groups, and 5-tetradecycloxy-2-furoic acid, an effective inhibitor of LG, did not abolish this. Lactate/pyruvate increased EST from octanoate and total LG but had little effect on octanoate oxidation. These data suggest that the capacity of medium-chain fatty acid esterification is adaptable to MCT content of the diet and may help regulate their metabolic fate. Despite high rates of KB production in the MCT group, the NADH-NAD ratio was not elevated. Rapid lipogenesis may contribute to the utilization of the excess energy equivalents formed. High LG and EST in the presence of a glycerol precursor may limit the usefulness of MCT in dietetic products for weight control. The animal fed an MCT diet is unusual in that the antithetical pathways of fatty acid catabolism and anabolism are being carried out simultaneously and at rapid rates. The lesser food efficiency of MCT may be related to the energy losses necessarily associated with cycling between these processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "When Drosophila melanogaster larvae were fed a defined fat-free, low sucrose medium, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was increased to a higher activity with a moderate, nontoxic level of ethanol (2.5% vol/vol) within 5 h. Ethanol-stimulated increases in ADH activity and cross-reacting material in late third-instar larvae were paralleled by increases in the larval ADH mRNA as indicated by dot blot analysis. Northern blot observations indicated that both adult and larval ADH messages were increased by dietary ethanol. The increased levels of the ADH mRNA transcribed from the proximal and distal promoters of ethanol-fed larvae argue that the induction is a consequence of elevated levels of mRNA, not a result of changes in enzyme stability or synthesis. To determine whether the induction is of nutritional significance to larvae, the rate of flux from ethanol to lipid was estimated in control larvae and larvae that were pre-fed ethanol. Flux changes occurred; the rate of incorporation of [14C]ethanol into body lipid showed a strong association with larval ADH activity. Because the induced increase in larval ADH activity did not extend into the adult stage and attempts to stimulate ADH activity by exposing adults to ethanol were unsuccessful, the modulation of ADH activity by dietary ethanol may be a mechanism by which larvae utilize environmental ethanol as a resource, especially when free sugar levels are low. In addition, ADH in larvae is postulated to perform a second, nonethanol function that expedites the conversion of sugars to lipid when habitats are low in fats, low in ethanol and high in sugars.\r"

The costs and outcomes of managing such children with splenectomy and IVGG were modeled with Markov processes. Children unresponsive to one treatment were considered to have received the alternative. The model accounted for spontaneous remissions, therapeutic responses, traumatic events, episodes of sepsis, and operative deaths. For a 10-year-old child with chronic ITP, the strategy of initial treatment with splenectomy had associated costs of $17,000 and a 97.9% ten-year survival rate, whereas the strategy of initial treatment with IVGG had associated costs of $21,000 but a 98.6% survival rate. Each additional life saved by employing the IVGG strategy cost $540,000, or $8,000 per year for a life expectancy of 70 years. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that for older children the IVGG strategy continued to result in improved survival rates but was more costly than the splenectomy strategy. For younger children, the IVGG strategy dominated, with improved survival rates and lower costs.\r"

  ".W": "We sought to define objective indicators of the resolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa endobronchial infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. We prospectively studied 75 patients admitted for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation and quantitated sputum bacterial density, DNA content, and the concentration of albumin and total protein in sputum, and compared these values with clinical evaluation. Eleven of the 75 patients had systemic signs, fever, and leukocytosis, which we arbitrarily defined as due to endobronchial infection. At the end of hospitalization, these 11 patients were afebrile, had peripheral leukocyte counts in the normal range, and were judged improved. Sputum P. aeruginosa density, DNA content, and total protein content on admission were similar in the two illness groups. Hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic administration for an average of 14.6 days were associated with improved pulmonary function in all 75 subjects (P values for forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume at 1 second, and peak expiratory flow rate were all less than 0.001). With improvement, there was a decrease in sputum P. aeruginosa density (mean of both groups decreased from 10(7.80) CFU/g on admission to 10(5.96) CFU/g; P less than 0.001), and a decreased DNA concentration (overall mean 4.73 +/- 4.75 on admission to 2.76 +/- 2.49 mg/g; P less than 0.002). The decrease in sputum total protein concentration for both groups was not significant (overall mean 60.5 +/- 48.4 to 43.9 +/- 38.2 mg/g; P = 0.06). Sputum albumin concentrations did not change in either group. We conclude that in cystic fibrosis subjects with a pulmonary exacerbation, bacterial density, sputum DNA and protein content decrease with hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic therapy. At the end of treatment, these indices of sputum infection and inflammation correlate with improved pulmonary function and clinical improvement. These changes are independent of the presence or absence of fever on admission.\r"

Both groups initially received the majority of their calories by parenteral alimentation. The groups were similar with respect to birth weight, gestational age, sex, Apgar score, and major neonatal diagnoses. The early enteral feeds proved to be significantly beneficial without an increased incidence of complications. The PO group reached full enteral feedings faster than the NPO group (31.2 vs 47.3 days). The PO group had a greater decline in serum bilirubin concentration over the first 2 weeks of life and spent less time under phototherapy (6.8 vs 9.5 days). Less cholestasis was observed among the PO infants (6.7% vs 33%), and peak direct bilirubin levels were also lower (0.7 vs 2.5 mg/dL). Osteopenia of prematurity, manifested by significantly lower alkaline phosphatase activity, was also decreased in the PO group, perhaps because of greater calcium intake during the first month among PO infants (1.3 vs 0.8 g). Compared with complete bowel rest, early onset of hypocaloric enteral feedings has beneficial effects on indirect hyperbilirubinemia, cholestatic jaundice, and metabolic bone disease of very low birth weight infants.\r"

An overgrowth of bacteria was observed over the entire surface of the clips. The mating surfaces of the Lactomer clips and the locking mechanisms of both types of clip were more heavily infected--that is, provided better support for bacterial growth--than other areas of the clips in the initial postimplantation period. However, with longer periods (up to seven days), the initial bacterial deposits developed into a thick, plaquelike layer. This layer appeared to restrict access to the surfaces such that the infected clips degraded at a much slower rate than did the noninfected clips, particularly Lactomer clips, on which little morphologic change was detectable seven days after implantation.\r"

The inflammatory response and tissue reactions to the implanted clips and their effects on clip breakdown were studied. By the first week after implantation, numerous inflammatory cells adhered to the clip surfaces, with occasional fibroblasts present. By two weeks after implantation there was a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells, but the number of fibroblasts gradually increased, resulting in encapsulation of the clips. The thickness of the fibrous tissue capsule, formed by a variety of collagen fibers, gradually increased 5-25 weeks after implantation. Residues from the Lactomer clips were still present within the encapsulating tissue at 25 weeks. In contrast, clips enclosed in nylon pouches were totally degraded, and no residues were detectable at 25 weeks. Tissue reactions similar to those observed for nonpouched implanted clips were seen over the entire external surface of the pouches.\r"

Different investigators, using different methods of chorionic biopsy, perform the sampling at various gestational ages. Accurate interpretation of results is dependent on reliable normal values, which could differ on the basis of gestational age. The enzymatic activities of arylsulfatase A, B-glucosidase and hexosaminidases were compared in trophoblast from six-, eight- and ten-week gestations. No significant differences in activity levels were detected. This finding confirms the accuracy of metabolic diagnosis for these enzyme-deficiency syndromes in trophoblastic tissue at gestational ages of six to ten weeks without a requirement for gestational-age-specific normal values.\r"

The absorption spectra and the uric acid, allantoin and urea concentrations were determined before and after in vitro exposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals to superoxide anion (O2) photochemically generated. The results showed a complete dissolution of MSU crystals after incubation under O2-, with decrease of uric acid and increase of allantoin and urea concentrations. Our results were confirmed by polarizing, electron microscopy and calorimetric techniques. The results obtained seem to confirm that the spontaneous resolution of acute gout attack could be attributed to the dissolving effect on urate crystals and the modification of coated proteins by O2- released by phagocytizing PMN.\r"

Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed induction of H-2Kk and beta 2m 3 days after culture of YAC-1 with DMSO, whereas optimal H-2Dd induction required more than 1 week. H-2Kk and H-2Dd induction by DMSO was equal to pretreatment of YAC-1 cells with 50-100 and 10-20 U/ml interferon (IFN)-gamma, respectively, but the T-cell differentiation antigens Lyt-1, Lyt-2, Thy-1, and L3T4 remained unaffected. DMSO protected YAC-1 cells from NK lysis as efficiently as 10-20 U IFN/ml, whereas susceptibility to anti-H-2a-, H-2Kk-, and H-2Dd-specific CTLs was augmented as in IFN-treated YAC-1 cells. In contrast, the beta 2m-deficient variant, which remained H-2 negative at the cell surface after DMSO treatment, also remained NK sensitive. Thus DMSO can induce H-2 expression and alter the sensitivity of murine lymphoma cells to different effector cells.\r"

Corroborative data were obtained by freezing brains with liquid nitrogen and measuring cortical concentrations of ATP, creatine phosphate (CP), and lactate. Immediately postimpact there was a rise in mean arterial pressure with a 38% increase of highly oxygenated blood and a shift toward oxidation in the cytochrome a, a3 redox state. By 4 hours postimpact, cytochrome a, a3 was becoming progressively reduced despite the persistence of hyperemia. This was associated with a significant (p less than 0.01) decrease in ATP and CP concentration. Additional studies in which a 0.5-sec, 100-v electrical seizure was induced before and after fluid percussion demonstrated significant differences in seizure response, indicating a failure of autoregulation.\r"

The P.A. assay involved incubating plasma with a radioiodinated protein substrate and counting the isotopic activity of the hydrolyzed fragments in the acid-soluble fraction. In patients, plasma P.A. increased in direct proportion to the extent of burn injury. To examine additional trends in plasma P.A. suggested by the patient P.A. data, we measured plasma P.A. in a burned rat model: circulating P.A. was significantly elevated at 6 hours and until at least 2 weeks postburn; infection with Pseudomonas and use of the proteolytic debriding agent, Travase, each further elevated this activity; the plasma P.A. was not directly derived from the burn site. We postulate that this elevated circulating P.A. triggers some of the pathologic as well as some physiologic sequelae which follow burn trauma.\r"

There was no significant difference in those immunized 30 days after the operation and reimmunized 7 days later. In mice immunized before splenectomy and reimmunized 30 days after splenectomy, the level of IgG anti-LPS antibodies was low, even in the mice splenectomized 30 days after primary immunization.

Only 11 of 283 admitted traumatized patients were Medicare patients. Yet, these 11 Medicare patients left the trauma center with a deficit of $249,601. No significant differences were found between the Medicare and non-Medicare groups for Trauma Score, CRAMS Score, Glasgow Coma Score, Injury Severity Score, ICU or hospital length of stay, disability, or mortality. Under DRG's, Medicare payments ($4,237 +/- 2,351/patient) have fallen to 20% of prior cost-based Medicare reimbursements ($21,542 +/- 34,170/patient), are providing only 16% of hospital costs ($26,928 +/- 42,713/patient), and are significantly (p less than 0.0001) less than non-Medicare reimbursements ($15,288 +/- 17,111/patient). Despite the high financial losses occurring when the trauma center treats referred traumatized Medicare patients, when all referred Medicare and non-Medicare patient trauma reimbursements are combined, overall trauma revenues have declined by only 4.3% under DRG's. If Medicare DRG payments were to be adopted by all third-party payers, reimbursement ($5,058 +/- 4,090/patient) would be significantly (p less than 0.0001) less than current hospital reimbursements ($14,801 +/- 16,537/patient) and costs ($16,121 +/- 17,624/patient). These results indicate that although high financial losses result when caring for traumatized Medicare patients, DRG's have not had a major financial effect upon centers receiving referred trauma patients because of the low numbers of admitted traumatized Medicare patients. However, if third-party payers were to enact the Medicare payment system, devastating economic losses would be inflicted upon major trauma centers.\r"

Since free radicals are closely associated with thromboxane (Tx) synthesis, this study examines the thesis that free radical scavengers inhibit formation of Tx. Anesthetized rats (n = 42) underwent right nephrectomy. By random choice, before 45 min of left renal pedicle clamping, rats received: 0.5 ml dextrose placebo IV (n = 6); the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl-thiourea (DMTU), 500 mg/kg IV (n = 10); or the superoxide scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD), 24,000 Sigma Units (SU)/kg IV (n = 12). This dose of SOD was repeated before release of the clamp. Treatment with DMTU and SOD decreased plasma TxB2 levels following 5 min of reperfusion from 2,480 pg/ml in dextrose treated controls to 1,155 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and 1,419 pg/ml (p less than 0.03), respectively.

At 24 hr, DMTU but not SOD decreased left renal weight from 113 to 94% (p less than 0.0003) of the weight of the previously removed right kidney, and histologically prevented acute tubular necrosis (p less than 0.05). In nephrectomized but nonischemic sham control rats (n = 7) plasma TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations were 757 pg/ml and 82 pg/ml, creatinine level 0.9 mg/dl and kidney weight 94% of the previously removed right kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All tumors were resected and all patients were presumed to be free of tumor at initiation of the prophylactic instillations. Before the bladder instillation program was begun all patients in the keyhole-limpet hemocyanin group Ia were immunized with 1 mg. keyhole-limpet hemocyanin intracutaneously and then monthly bladder instillations of 10 mg. were given. The control group Ib received 20 mg. mitomycin C monthly. Of the 21 patients in the keyhole-limpet hemocyanin group Ia (mean followup 20.7 months) 3 (14.2 per cent) had recurrences, compared to 9 of 23 (39.1 per cent) in the mitomycin C group Ib (mean followup 18.3 months). The over-all preventive effect was significantly better (p less than 0.05, chi-square) in keyhole-limpet hemocyanin-treated patients than in those given mitomycin C. In 1984 a new single drug study (group II) was started with keyhole-limpet hemocyanin alone, administered as in group Ia. Of 81 patients in group II (nonrandomized, mean followup 22.8 months) 17 (20.9 per cent) had recurrences. Of the patients given keyhole-limpet hemocyanin 20 of 21 (95.2 per cent) in group Ia and 70 of 81 (86.4 per cent) in group II had complete and partial prevention (downgrading), compared to 16 of 23 (69.5 per cent) in group Ib. Our study was established to analyze the effect of a new method of immunotherapy; no adverse local or systemic side effects were noted.\r"

Fifty mongrel dogs underwent in vitro platelet aggregation studies with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, and AA used as inducing agents.

Platelet aggregation in response to AA stimulation occurred in 16 (responders) and 16 showed no aggregatory response (nonresponders). The animals were divided into four groups. Group I received no antiplatelet agents (control); group II received U-63,557A, a specific thromboxane synthetase inhibitor (TSI); group III received aspirin; and group IV received aspirin and TSI. Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were implanted in the carotid and femoral arteries of the dogs in all four groups. Plasma thromboxane (TxB2) levels were drawn before drug treatment and 4 weeks after surgery. Platelet deposition on the luminal surface of the implanted grafts was studied in vivo with a technique that uses both 111In-labeled platelets and 99mTc-labeled red blood cells and was expressed as percentage of indium excess (%IE). Group I (control) dogs whose platelets aggregated in response to AA stimulation had significantly higher 24-hour platelet deposition (%IE) on the luminal surface of implanted grafts (p less than 0.02), lower 4-week graft patency (p less than 0.002), and higher plasma TxB2 levels (p less than 0.01) than those dogs whose platelets did not aggregate. In contrast to the results of AA stimulation, neither ADP nor collagen responsiveness was discriminatory for the thrombotic potential of canine arteries as measured by 24-hour platelet deposition (%IE), 4-week graft patency, or plasma TxB2 levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We simulated a program for lowering cholesterol levels that was similar to that of the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, and then used the outcomes of the trial to calculate the incremental cost per year of life saved (YOLS) from the perspective of society. Our findings suggest that the cost per YOLS ranges from $117,400 (cholestyramine resin packets) to $70,900 (colestipol packets) and $17,800 (oat bran). Using bulk drug reduces the cost per YOLS to $65,100 (cholestyramine resin) and $63,900 (colestipol). Targeting bulk colestipol treatment only to smokers has a cost per YOLS of $47,010; the incremental cost of treating nonsmokers would be $89,600 per additional YOLS. Although pharmacologic therapy has substantial costs, it may be more cost-effective when low-cost forms are applied to particular high-risk groups, such as smokers. However, a broad public health approach to lowered cholesterol levels by additional dietary modification, such as with soluble fiber, may be preferred to a medically oriented campaign that focuses on drug therapy.\r"

We conducted a study of the cost-effectiveness of a cervical cancer screening program for infrequently screened elderly women attending an urban municipal hospital clinic. The results of Papanicolaou testing were abnormal (malignant or premalignant) in 11 of 816 women screened. This early detection of cervical neoplasia saved +5907 and 3.7 years of life per 100 Papanicolaou tests. When average medical costs per year of life extended by screening were included, the program cost +2874 per year of life saved. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses performed on competing medical and economic points of view did not change the conclusion of a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio for screening. Our findings indicate that the benefits from some prevention programs for the elderly can offset the costs of these programs. More research is needed to guide public policy on prevention for selected population groups.\r"

Resource use was measured in constant 1982 dollars adjusted for differences in clinical severity of the patients. Although average length of stay decreased by almost 40% during this period, the number of physician services doubled and total physician costs increased almost threefold. The increase in physician costs was due primarily to the use of complex diagnostic technologies and to the provision of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The results of this study suggest that as hospital costs are constrained by prospective payment, physician costs may continue to rise as new diagnostic and therapeutic services are introduced into practice and as more care is shifted to the outpatient setting.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative renal failure and insufficiency are important complications of operations that require thoracic aortic cross-clamping. Successful application of pharmacologic methods to protect renal function would be clinically useful. The ability of mannitol and dopamine to prevent renal dysfunction in a canine model of thoracic aortic cross-clamping was studied. Twenty animals were divided into four equal groups, and all underwent thoracic aortic cross-clamping for 60 minutes. An intra-aortic infusion of saline (control), mannitol, dopamine, or mannitol plus dopamine was started before, and continued during, the period of aortic occlusion. Glomerular filtration rate was significantly depressed 60 minutes after clamp release, and although there was some recovery in treated animals 150 minutes after clamp release, it remained significantly decreased (52% to 73% of baseline values, p less than 0.01). Renal blood flow was significantly reduced 60 minutes after clamp release, and there was no recovery in any group at 150 minutes (38% to 56% of baseline values, p less than 0.01). No significant differences in osmolar clearance or fractional excretion of sodium were evident between groups. These data reveal that the profound reductions in glomerular filtration and renal blood flow induced by thoracic aortic cross-clamping were not attenuated by mannitol or dopamine and suggest that efforts to protect renal function should be directed toward improving renal blood flow in the post-clamp period.\r"

All women had completed a menstrual history questionnaire. 99 women were on oral contraceptives at the time of the study. Of the 158 subjects who were not on oral contraceptives 18% had irregular cycles. 116 (73%) women had normal ovaries and 36 (23%) had PCO. 5 women had multifollicular ovaries and 1 had small, unstimulated ovaries. Only 1 woman with normal ovaries had an irregular menstrual cycle. Of the women with PCO, 76% had irregular cycles, and 6 of the 8 with regular cycles were hirsute. Women with and those without PCO differed in distribution of serum LH concentrations although the median values were similar. 25% of women with PCO had LH concentrations which exceeded the upper limit of the normal range. Thus PCO are common in normal women. Some of these women may have clinical and biochemical markers of PCO, which suggest that PCO in women who consider themselves to be normal is part of the same clinical spectrum as the classic Stein-Leventhal syndrome.\r"

Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with local tumor control than for patients who failed locally (31% vs. 0%).\r"

In 7 of the 8 hereditary cases, RTA-1 appeared to be a complication of hereditary hypercalciuria. The majority of acquired cases (61%) were secondary to immune-mediated diseases. All of the 14 infants with RTA-1 were classified as idiopathic. All of the idiopathic cases in children and adults were associated with nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, 33% of which had a family history of nephrolithiasis. The 14 infants presented with failure to thrive. Seventy-seven percent of children and adults with RTA-1 had nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis and usually presented with symptoms related to this problem. Adults without nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis usually presented with electrolyte disturbances or acidosis. Hypokalemia, the most common electrolyte disturbance, was present in 28% of the entire series. Acidosis was present in all infants and in 70% of children and adults. Clinically apparent bone disease was observed in 3 infants, and in 1 adult with nephrolithiasis. Glomerular function was normal in infants and in the 2 children, but depressed in 40% of adults. Recurrent urinary tract infection was a contributing factor but was not the sole cause of renal failure. Surprisingly, kidney stone number, the number of surgical procedures, and the presence of nephrocalcinosis had no apparent effect on the development of renal failure. Glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in patients with incomplete RTA-1, and serum total CO2 was significantly correlated with creatinine clearance and minimum urinary pH. Hypercalciuria was present in 32% of patients with nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, and urinary citrate excretion was low in all of 16 patients in whom it was measured. Hypocitraturia appeared to be due in most cases to potassium depletion and renal failure, but may have occurred as a primary defect in 1 patient with hereditary RTA. Urinary uric acid excretion was elevated in 23% of patients with stones in whom it was measured. The mean number of stone-forming events was 51 +/- 14. Although a weak correlation between urinary calcium excretion and stone number was observed, the cause for prodigious stone formation could not be explained. This series emphasizes the variable degree to which the common clinical manifestations of RTA-1 (metabolic acidosis, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and potassium depletion) are expressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin interacts with two types of receptors: V1, which mediates the effects of vasopressin on vascular smooth muscle, and V2, which mediates the antidiuretic effects on renal tubules. Resistance of the renal tubules to arginine vasopressin and to the antidiuretic V2-specific agonist 1-desamino[8-D-arginine] vasopressin (dDAVP) occurs in congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a rare X-linked disease, although the V1-receptor responses remain intact. The extrarenal actions of dDAVP in normal persons are a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in plasma renin activity, and stimulation of the release of factor VIIIc and von Willebrand factor. We measured the response of mean arterial pressure, pulse rate, plasma renin activity, factor VIIIc, and von Willebrand factor to an infusion of dDAVP (0.3 microgram per kilogram of body weight) in seven male patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, six obligatory carriers of the gene for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, five patients with central diabetes insipidus, and four normal subjects. In the normal subjects and the patients with central diabetes insipidus, dDAVP decreased mean arterial pressure (by 10 to 15 percent) and increased pulse rate (by 20 to 25 percent), renin activity (by 65 percent), and the release of coagulation factors (twofold to threefold) (all changes were significant, P less than 0.01). None of these changes were observed in the patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and minimal responses were observed in the obligatory carriers. These results confirm the existence of extrarenal vasopressin V2-like receptors, which may be defective in patients with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\r"

  ".W": "We discontinued anticonvulsant drugs in 92 patients who had been free of seizures during two years of treatment with a single drug. All the patients had epilepsy that had previously been untreated, and had been randomly assigned to receive carbamazepine, phenytoin, or sodium valproate. Thirty-one patients relapsed, and 61 remained free of seizures. The mean duration of the follow-up in the patients remaining free of seizures was 35 months (range, 6 to 62). There was no significant difference between the relapse rate among adults (35 percent) and that among children (31 percent). Our results suggest that the number of seizures a patient had before control was achieved, the number of drugs tried as single-drug therapy, and the type of treatment withdrawn all influenced the outcome. Among the various types of seizures, complex partial seizures with secondary generalization carried the worst prognosis. In comparison, the risk of relapse was 65 percent lower in patients with generalized seizures and 97 percent lower in patients with complex or simple partial seizures in the absence of secondary generalized attacks. Among the four electroencephalographic classes, class 4 (abnormal before treatment and unchanged before withdrawal) carried the worst prognosis. The risk of relapse was 94 to 99 percent lower in patients in the other three electroencephalographic classes. Among the three anticonvulsants, withdrawal of sodium valproate carried the worst prognosis. In comparison, the odds of relapsing were 28 percent lower after withdrawal of phenytoin and 85 percent lower after withdrawal of carbamazepine. We conclude that withdrawal of anticonvulsant medication should be considered in patients free of seizures for two years.\r"

We successfully induced immune tolerance in patients with such antibodies with a new treatment protocol, which combined factor VIII, cyclophosphamide, and high-dose intravenous IgG, followed by regular prophylactic treatment with factor VIII. This protocol has now been used in 11 patients with hemophilia A, of whom 9 had a strong antibody response. When the initial concentration of antibodies exceeded 3 Malmo inhibitor units (corresponding to about 10 Bethesda units) per milliliter, treatment was preceded by adsorption of antibody to protein A. After two to three weeks of the combined treatment, factor VIII coagulant antibodies had disappeared in 9 of the 11 patients; in 8 of these 9 patients the half-life of infused factor VIII had normalized. The tolerant state appears to be stable after a median of 30 months. Two patients did not respond to the treatment. Because earlier treatment with factor VIII and cyclophosphamide or with factor VIII and IgG had been ineffective in these patients, our experience suggests that all three components of the protocol are required for the successful induction of tolerance to factor VIII.\r"

Data were obtained from the records of 214,839 patients who received care in 981 hospitals in 45 states from July 1, 1983, through June 30, 1984. We found significant associations between higher mortality rates among inpatients and the stringency of state programs to review hospital rates (P less than or equal to 0.05), the stringency of certificate-of-need legislation (P less than or equal to 0.01), and the intensity of competition in the marketplace, as measured by enrollment in health maintenance organizations (P less than or equal to 0.05). Hospitals in the states with the most stringent review procedures for hospital rates had ratios of actual to predicted death rates that were 6 to 10 percent higher than those of hospitals in states with less stringent rate-review programs (P less than or equal to 0.001). Hospitals in the states with the most stringent procedures for reviewing applications for certificates of need had ratios of actual to predicted death rates that were 5 to 6 percent higher than those of hospitals in states with less stringent certificate-of-need procedures (P less than or equal to 0.05). There was no statistically significant association between mortality rates among inpatients and either the type of hospital ownership or the number of hospitals competing in the market area. Additional analyses, which examined alternative explanations for these findings, failed to change the results. These findings raise serious concerns about the welfare of patients who are admitted to hospitals in highly regulated areas and those admitted to hospitals in relatively competitive markets. They suggest that it is important to incorporate quality-assurance procedures and systems to monitor patients' outcomes into public and private programs designed to contain costs or promote competition, or both.\r"

  ".W": "Cytosolic free calcium has recently been implicated in the regulation of mitosis in plant and animal cells. We have previously found correlations between increases in the levels of intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i and visible transitions of structure at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and the onset of anaphase during mitosis in sea urchin embryos and tissue culture cells. To go beyond correlations it is necessary to manipulate [Ca2+]i, and in sea urchin embryos this requires the injection of calcium-chelator buffer solutions as the changes in free calcium in the cell cycle are dependent on intracellular stores. We report here that blocking the increase in [Ca2+]i which just precedes NEBD prevents this from taking place and halts mitosis. Subsequent injections which momentarily increase [Ca2+]i, or a natural recovery of the higher calcium levels, result in NEBD and the successful continuation of mitosis. Similarly, artificially increasing calcium by early injections results in early NEBD. We conclude that the increase in [Ca2+]i preceding NEBD is an essential regulatory step required for entry into mitosis.\r"

Changes in the concentration of free calcium (Cai) in the cytoplasm control a variety of cellular functions and it has thus been suggested that observed variations in Cai during the cell cycle may be the cytoplasmic signal that co-ordinates nuclear and cytoplasmic division. We show here that increases in Cai induced by the calcium-releasing second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), or by calcium buffers, cause premature chromatin condensation and breakdown of the nuclear envelope in sea urchin (Lytechinus pictus) early embryos. Both natural and induced chromatin condensation are prevented by calcium chelators. The nucleus becomes sensitive to the Cai signal 45 min after fertilization, but remains insensitive if protein synthesis is prevented. Our experiments demonstrate that Cai regulates the behaviour of the nucleus during the cell cycle, suggest that Ins(1,4,5)P3 is a cell cycle messenger and indicate that there is an interaction between the protein and ionic signals that control the state of chromatin during the cell cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Many studies have established that a select subset of normal cellular genes are altered in cancer by point mutations, translocations or gene amplification. However, the vast majority of genetic changes that occur in neoplastic cells have not yet been identified. In an attempt to identify some of these other genetic changes, we have recently isolated a gene, GLI, by virtue of its amplification in a human glioblastoma. Subsequently, GLI was found to be amplified in other human glioblastomas (ref. 3 and unpublished data). To understand better the role of GLI in human neoplasia, we have now cloned the GLI complementary DNA (cDNA) and determined its nucleotide sequence. Analysis of the predicted translation product reveals that it contains five repeats of a DNA binding consensus sequence (zinc finger) originally described in Xenopus Transcription Factor III A (TFIIIA). Furthermore, these zinc fingers contain sequence elements that suggest the GLI gene product is a member of the recently described Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins. Additional experiments demonstrate that GLI is an evolutionarily conserved gene that is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in most adult tissues. The link between the developmentally important Kruppel family of genes and GLI is interesting considering the similarities between developing embryonic and neoplastic tissue.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine resource utilization for hospitalized neurology patients treated during a 2-year period at an academic medical center. All patients (N = 1,993) were stratified by payor (Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross, and other) and age (0-35 years, 35-65 years, and 65 years and above). Mean hospital cost per patient (exclusive of MD fees) for each payor generally rose with age. Patients 35 years of age and over consumed a disproportionately larger share of resources than younger patients. DRG payment under an all payor system would have produced a substantial deficit for this group of patients. The mean hospital length of stay, number of diagnoses per patient, and mortality, as well as percent of admission through the emergency department generally rose with age. This study demonstrated that neurology patients 35 years of age and older generated higher resource utilization than their younger counterparts and were underpaid by the current DRG reimbursement. In this study, DRG payment appeared to provide significant financial disincentives to treat older neurology patients. If our findings are widespread, the quality of neurologic care and the elderly's access to it could become limited in the future.\r"

The kinetics of the enzyme were also investigated, and the enzyme activity related to different degrees of pathology. A marked reduction of the enzyme activity was found in hypertensive patients, compared with controls. This reduction was greater when hypertension was associated with worse prognostic signs, such as proteinuria. These features are in agreement with the increased sodium content and the increased vascular reactivity found in pregnancy-induced hypertension. The enzyme activity appears to be decreased by means of a conformational modification of the enzyme sites, a phenomenon related to the hypertensive condition.\r"

The development of human menopausal gonadotropins in the early 1960s gave us a much more powerful tool with which to influence ovulation in all forms of ovulatory disturbances. Elucidation of the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone together with its isolation and synthesis has allowed us to streamline our methods of inducing ovulation in hypothalamic amenorrheic patients by using endogenous control mechanisms to maximize both safety and effectiveness. However, there are problems yet to solve. Polycystic ovarian disease has long eluded our efforts to resolve its pathophysiology as well as to devise a consistently effective and safe means of treatment. Methods to restore ovulation in patients with polycystic ovarian disease refractory to clomiphene citrate is the quest of future investigations.\r"

As well as obtaining the dimensions--such as length and area--of the utricular and saccular maculae, we also found that (1) most of the utricular macula lies in one plane, which is the same as the plane of the lateral semicircular canal, (2) the saccular macula is shaped like part of a sphere, and (3) the angle between the two maculae is less than a right angle. Such knowledge is indispensable to the evaluation of the function of the utricular and saccular maculae.\r"

Benson and Hyden et al. noted a steady increase in VOR gain in the higher-frequency range (2 to 5 Hz), where visual feedback has little effect. Similar behavior has also been reported in the monkey models. Eleven patients with diagnoses of Meniere's disease had tests of VOR and VOR cancellations performed with the use of pseudorandom oscillations as high as 5 Hz. The responses at various frequencies were compared with normal data from 17 subjects. The VOR gain in patients exhibited a more rapid rise at high frequencies than that observed in normal subjects. For example, at 3.5 Hz the normal gain was 1.09, whereas patients exhibited a gain of 1.35 (mean of 11 subjects). When the performance during VOR cancellation tasks was compared, Meniere's patients appeared to be less able to perform these tasks; however, when the values were compared by use of a cancellation index that compensates for any difference in VOR gain, this apparent difference disappeared.\r"

Twenty-seven of 52 patients with diagnosed autoimmune inner ear disease (52%) manifested endolymphatic hydrops, usually bilateral. Treatment consisted of low salt diet, diuretic, vestibular suppressant, and usually prednisone. Cytotoxic drugs and lymphocytoplasmapheresis were reserved for refractory cases. Audiometric followup (average, 23 months) was available in 12 patients. Using American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, hearing improved or stabilized in at least one ear in nine patients and deteriorated bilaterally in three patients. Vestibular treatment results paralleled auditory treatment results. Autoimmune endolymphatic hydrops should be considered in the differential diagnosis when symptoms are bilateral and do not respond to conventional therapy or when immune laboratory tests are positive. In suspect patients, medical therapy with prednisone, and rarely cytotoxic drugs and lymphocytoplasmapheresis, should be recommended. Further research is needed to determine whether surgery should be performed in medically unresponsive cases.\r"

After the squamous carcinoma lines on fetal rat skulls were implanted the explants with their added tumor were maintained in long-term tissue culture by use of the procedures developed for growing these tumor cells. Results confirm direct interaction with the bone by the malignant cells. Specific surface and cytoplasmic markers have been demonstrated by use of monoclonal antibodies against the tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor angiogenesis without the addition of any endogenous endothelial components has been verified. Investigations into the degree of bone infiltration and susceptibility of these interacting tumor cells to various factors, radiation therapy, and chemotherapeutic agents have been carried out. The establishment of a model system for bony invasion by squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck permits the investigation of the mechanism of tumor invasion and the study of various potential treatment modalities.\r"

Both are mosaics of many different middle-repetitive DNA sequences interspersed with single-copy DNA sequences. Sixty percent of cloned inserts derived from division 20 and about 40 percent from subdivisions 19EF of the X chromosome harbor at least one repetitive DNA sequence in an average insert of 4.5 kilobases. No repeats have significant cross-hybridization to any of the eleven satellite DNAs, or to the clustered-scrambled sequences present in pDm1. The repetitive elements are, in general, confined to the beta-heterochromatic regions of polytene chromosomes, but some are adjacent to nomadic elements. Chromosome 4, however, has some repeats spread throughout its entire euchromatin. These data have implications for the structure of transition zones between euchromatin and heterochromatin of mitotic chromosomes and also provide a molecular basis for reexamining some of the unusual classical properties of chromosome 4.\r"

The enzyme mainly produced a linear monomer recombinant DNA that can be packaged in vitro. Novobiocin and anti-calf thymus DNA topoisomerase II antibody inhibit this ATP-dependent recombination. The recombinant molecules contain duplications or deletions, and most crossovers take place between nonhomologous sequences of lambda DNA, as judged by the sequences of recombination junctions. Therefore, the recombination mediated by the calf thymus DNA topoisomerase II is an illegitimate recombination that is similar to recombination mediated by Escherichia coli DNA gyrase or phage T4 DNA topoisomerase. The subunit exchange model, which has been suggested for the DNA gyrase-mediated recombination, is now generalized as follows: DNA topoisomerase II molecules bind to DNAs, associate with each other, and lead to the exchange of DNA strands through the exchange of topoisomerase II subunits. Illegitimate recombination might be carried out by a general mechanism in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes.\r"

  ".W": "The gene for Gs alpha (the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs) was isolated from human genomic libraries using rat Gs alpha cDNA as a probe. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the human gene with that of the rat cDNA revealed that the human Gs alpha gene spans approximately equal to 20 kilobases and is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns. Genomic Southern blot analysis suggests that the human haploid genome contains a single Gs alpha gene. Previous reports indicated the presence of multiple species of Gs alpha cDNA. The structure of the human Gs alpha gene suggests that four types of Gs alpha mRNAs may be generated from a single Gs alpha gene by alternate use of exon 3 and/or of two 3' splice sites of intron 3, where an unusual splice junction sequence (TG) instead of the consensus (AG) is used. S1 nuclease mapping analysis of human Gs alpha mRNA identified multiple transcriptional initiation sites. The promoter region of the human Gs alpha gene has extremely high G + C content (85%). It contains 4 \"GC\" boxes, but no typical \"TATA\" or \"CAAT\" box sequence. In the 5' flanking region, there are several blocks of sequences that are similar to the sequences of the 5' flanking region of the human c-Ki-ras2 gene.\r"

Yet progress in understanding ecdysone receptors has been inhibited by the lack of a suitable highly radioactive hormone analog with high affinity for the receptor. Here we report that the synthetic ecdysteroid 26-iodoponasterone A is one of the most active ecdysones known, inducing half-maximal morphological transformation in Drosophila Kc167 cells when present at 0.5 nM. 26-[125I]Iodoponasterone A can be prepared at a specific activity of 2175 Ci/mmol (1 Ci = 37 GBq) by reaction of the precursor 26-mesylinokosterone with carrier-free Na125I. The radiolabeled material binds to Kc167 cell ecdysone receptors specifically and with affinity (Kd ca. 3.8 X 10(-10) M). Thus, 26-[125I]iodoponasterone A appears to be a superior radioligand for ecdysone receptors on grounds both of affinity and of specific activity. Its ready availability should greatly facilitate studies of these receptors.\r"

Cytoplasmic extracts from rat tissues and hepatoma cells were shown by an electrophoretic separation procedure to form RNA-protein complexes involving a highly conserved sequence in the 5' untranslated region of both ferritin heavy- and light-subunit mRNAs. The pattern of complex formation was affected by pretreatment of rats or cells with iron. Crosslinking by UV irradiation showed that the complexes contained an 87-kDa protein interacting with the conserved sequence of the ferritin mRNA. We propose that intracellular iron levels regulate ferritin synthesis by causing changes in specific protein binding to the conserved sequence in the ferritin heavy- and light-subunit mRNAs.\r"

Sites of carcinogen modification of DNA were identified by polyclonal rabbit antibodies elicited against DNA modified with B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I in vitro. This antigenic DNA contained trans-(7R)-N2-[10-(7 beta,8 alpha,9 alpha-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[alpha]pyrene)-yl]- deoxyguanosine; other adducts were not detected by liquid chromatography. In this study, DNA replication forks with antibodies bound to B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I adducts were detected by electron microscopy. The frequency of replication forks containing carcinogen adducts associated with the fork junction was found to be 8-fold higher than expected for an average distribution. The proportion of replication forks that were apparently blocked at the site of the DNA damage increased when replication was allowed to occur after carcinogen exposure. These results support the conclusions that the fork junction is particularly vulnerable to adduction by B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I and that B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I adducts block the displacement of replication forks during DNA synthesis in intact cells.\r"

Analysis of purified populations of spermatogenic cell types indicates that the 2.4-kb transcript is selectively expressed in haploid postmeiotic early spermatids. The evidence for a developmentally regulated expression of pim-1 in haploid spermatids suggests a possible developmental role for this protooncogene product. The 2.4-kb pim-1 transcript present in postmeiotic cells differs in size from the 2.8-kb transcript usually detected in somatic tissues. Similar testis-specific transcripts have been seen for mos and abl genes. These data suggest specificity in transcription or processing of certain genes in haploid male germ cells. We have also analyzed other representative protooncogenes, including examples of protein kinases, the ras family, and the \"nuclear\" protooncogenes. The results indicate that additional protooncogenes are preferentially expressed in either meiotic pachytene cells or postmeiotic early spermatids. These findings suggest a differential regulation of gene expression in these two developmental stages of germ cells. In particular, analysis of expression of the three members of the ras gene family indicates a distinct temporal differential regulation in the expression of the Harvey, Kirsten, and N-ras genes in these germ cells.\r"

We have isolated a genomic DNA clone encompassing the human cellular counterpart of the gene, JUN, and used this DNA to determine the chromosomal location of the gene. A panel of DNA preparations derived from rodent-human somatic cell hybrids with defined chromosome complements was first screened with the JUN probe. This Southern blot analysis indicated that JUN is situated on the short arm of chromosome 1. In situ hybridization then assigned JUN to chromosome region 1p31-32, a chromosomal region involved in both translocations and deletions of chromosomes seen in human malignancies.\r"

Terminal differentiation in plasma cells is, however, accompanied by a loss of class II gene expression. In B cells this gene system is under the control of several loci encoding transacting factors with activator function, one of which, the aIr-1 gene product, operates across species barriers. In this report human class II gene expression is shown to be extinguished in somatic cell hybrids between the human class II-positive B-cell line Raji and the mouse class II-negative plasmacytoma cell line P3-U1. Since all murine chromosomes are retained in these hybrids and no preferential segregation of a specific human chromosome is observed, the results are compatible with the presence of suppressor factors of mouse origin, operating across species barriers and inhibiting class II gene expression. Suppression seems to act at the level of transcription or accumulation of class II-specific mRNA, since no human, and very few murine, class II transcripts are detectable in the hybrids.\r"

  ".U": "88176921\r", 
  ".W": "Present understanding of the evolution of immunoglobulins is derived almost entirely from studies of a few mammalian species. To obtain information about immunoglobulin genes in Xenopus laevis, a cDNA library was prepared in the expression vector lambda gt11 from mitogen-stimulated splenocytes of this species. Of approximately equal to 50,000 clones screened, 18 were found to express IgM epitopes. One of these, lambda XIg14, hybridized with RNA of RNA of approximately equal to 2 kilobases from splenocytes. The insert of this clone appears to encode a variable region and part of a mu constant region; that of another clone, lambda XIg8, appears to encode a variable region and a complete mu constant region. Both inserts contain sequence corresponding to the three gene segments (VH, DH, and JH) that encode heavy-chain variable regions. The heavy-chain constant region (CH) encoded by lambda XIg8 has the characteristic features of C mu, including a four-domain structure and a carboxyl-terminal tail. The amino acid sequences of two mu-chain peptides agree with the cDNA sequence. The identity in amino acid sequence between the corresponding Xenopus and mouse C mu domains ranges from 31 to 47%. The C mu domains vary in the extent to which their sequences resemble the sequences of other immunoglobulins, consistent with previous suggestions that the immunoglobulin domains have an independent evolutionary history.\r"

  ".W": "A cDNA library was constructed from size-fractionated poly(A)+ RNA prepared from a murine pre-B-cell hybridoma expressing high levels of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) and mu heavy chains. Transformed bacterial colonies were screened for recombinant plasmids containing cDNA coding for BiP by hybrid-selected mRNA translation. A clone, pMBiP, containing a 736-base-pair insert was shown to encode the protein. Translation in vitro of hybridoma mRNA selected by hybridization to the pMBiP cDNA yielded a single polypeptide of BiP-like size. The authenticity of this mRNA was verified by comparing the peptides obtained by the limited proteolysis of its in vitro translation product with those obtained from the in vivo produced BiP. Likewise, the authenticity of the cDNA insert was verified by an RNase A protection assay of heteroduplex molecules obtained by annealing a uniformly labeled single-strand copy of the cDNA clone with the same mRNA selected by hybridization and tested by translation. The nucleotide sequence of this clone enabled us to deduce the carboxyl-terminal 142 amino acids of BiP and to establish its kinship with the 70-kDa heat shock protein family. The finding of a single copy of the BiP gene in DNA blots of mouse and rat implies that the BiP-related RNA transcripts constitutively expressed in various murine tissues and cell lines are indeed products of the same gene. These findings imply that BiP plays a more general role than previously anticipated on the basis of the discovery of its association with immunoglobulin heavy chains.\r"

  ".U": "88176927\r", 
  ".W": "Mutagen treatment of mouse P815 tumor cells produces tum- variants that are rejected by syngeneic mice because these variants express new surface antigens. These \"tum- antigens\" are recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes but induce no detectable antibody response. Transfection of P815 cell line P1.HTR with DNA of tum- variant P91 yielded transfectants expressing tum- antigen P91A. They were detected by their ability to stimulate proliferation of cytolytic T lymphocytes [Wolfel, T., Van Pel, A., De Plaen, E., Lurquin, C., Maryanski, J. L. & Boon, T. (1987) Immunogenetics 26, 178-187]. A cosmid library of a cell line expressing antigen P91A was transfected into P1.HTR. Transfectants expressing the antigen were obtained. By packaging directly the DNA of a transfectant with lambda phage extracts, we obtained a small cosmid population containing as major component a cosmid that transferred the expression of P91A. The assay of various restriction fragments of this cosmid led to the isolation of an 800-base-pair fragment containing the P91A sequence required for transfection. Comparison with a homologous cDNA showed that this fragment contained only one of the several exons of the P91A gene. The normal and the tum- forms of the gene differ by one nucleotide located in this 137-base-pair exon. The essential role of this mutation, which produces an amino acid change, was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. No significant sequence similarity was found between the 800-base-pair fragment and any recorded gene.\r"

  ".W": "Intravital microscopy and determination of in vivo histamine release revealed that the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin reduced antigen-induced vasodilation while enhancing plasma extravasation, leukocyte accumulation, and histamine release in cheek pouches of immunized hamsters. Topical application of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 30 nM) totally reversed the indomethacin-induced potentiation of the inflammatory reaction to antigen challenge and suppressed both the histamine release and plasma leakage also in the absence of indomethacin. On the other hand, PGE2, which per se caused vasodilation, markedly potentiated the postcapillary leakage of plasma induced by histamine or leukotriene C4, as well as the leukocyte activation and subsequent plasma extravasation evoked by leukotriene B4. Taken together, the data indicate that PGE2 reduced the antigen response by suppression of mediator release from the numerous mast cells present in the cheek pouch. Moreover, the PGE2-sensitive potentiation by indomethacin of the antigen response suggests that endogenous vasodilating prostaglandins (possibly PGE2) predominantly were anti-inflammatory.\r"

  ".U": "88177743\r", 
  ".W": "For more than 50 years, experimental studies on fever have focused on a substance from leukocytes called leukocytic or endogenous pyrogen. Various investigators concluded that changes associated with infection--such as numbers of circulating leukocytes; levels of trace metals, amino acids, and hepatic proteins; and altered lymphocyte function--were also caused by endogenous leukocyte mediators. There was reasonable evidence that fever and these other changes were brought about through the action of a single endogenous pyrogen, now known as interleukin 1 (IL-1). Two forms of IL-1 have been cloned (IL-1 beta and IL-1 alpha), and studies of recombinant IL-1 preparations have confirmed that fever and the broad spectrum of host responses to infection and injury are indeed mediated by this substance. However, IL-1 is not the only leukocyte product that induces fever: tumor necrosis factor (cachectin) and interferon produce fever in humans and animals. Accordingly, the concept of a single endogenous pyrogen now requires modification. Nature has conferred the ability to produce fever on no fewer than three structurally distinct molecules. Investigators trying to determine what triggers the hypothalamus to initiate fever in a particular disease must now consider these three endogenous pyrogens, either alone or together, as mediators of fever.\r"

Biochemical analysis of the mutant subunit indicates a 100-fold decreased affinity for the regulatory subunit. The mutant catalytic subunit exhibits approximately a threefold increase in Michaelis constant for adenosine triphosphate and peptide cosubstrates, and is essentially unchanged in its catalytic rate. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant gene contains a single nucleotide change resulting in a threonine-to-alanine substitution at amino acid 241. This residue is conserved in other serine-threonine protein kinases. These results identify this threonine as an important contact between catalytic and regulatory subunits but only a minor contact in substrate recognition.\r"

  ".W": "In Hawaii, flies of the genus Drosophila have undergone spectacular adaptive radiation, resulting in the evolution of more than 500 species of Drosophila that are found nowhere else on earth. This taxonomic uniqueness is reflected in behavior and morphology. Hawaiian Drosophila sing songs, as do continental Drosophila; however, the Hawaiian songs have diverged strongly in form and mechanism of production. The click-song of D. fasciculisetae's (Maui) has a carrier frequency an order of magnitude higher than those reported in familiar continental species, such as D. melanogaster (170 hertz). Drosophila fasciculisetae's song resembles a cicada's more than a fly's song. The song of D. cyrtoloma (Maui) has a complex pulse rhythm more typical of crickets than flies. The pulse song of D. silvestris (Hawaii) closely resembles that of D. melanogaster in both pulse rhythm and carrier frequency, but D. melanogaster sings by vibrating its wings, whereas D. silvestris sings through abdominal vibrations. These mechanisms are radical departures from the continental wing song mechanism and are further examples of the remarkable behavioral innovation that has occurred in the Drosophila of Hawaii during their evolutionary transit through these islands.\r"

To distinguish whether these factors bound to UAS2 cooperatively or formed a complex in the absence of DNA, HAP2 and HAP3 were tagged by gene fusion to LexA and beta-galactosidase, respectively, and purified through four chromatographic steps. The copurification of LexA-HAP2, HAP3 beta-galactosidase, and UAS2 binding activity shows that HAP2 and HAP3 associate in the absence of DNA to form a multisubunit activation complex.\r"

Seventy-four per cent of the SIP were surgically implanted while patients were hospitalized. The SIP were used for chemotherapeutic agents (83.0 per cent), blood products (29.0 per cent) or hyperosmolar total parenteral nutrition (8.5 per cent) and accessed a median of three occasions. Eighty-four per cent were used in an outpatient setting at least part of the time. Thirty-nine per cent of SIP were associated with complications, including local infection or sepsis (16.4 per cent), thrombosis of the catheter or central vein (9.7 per cent) and extravasation from the port secondary to needle dislodgement (6.4 per cent). The risk of complication was slightly higher in those SIP first used ten to 14 days after placement as compared with those used earlier or later (p less than 0.05). In 23 of 32 episodes, clinically diagnosed local infection unassociated with systemic sepsis or skin necrosis was successfully treated without removal of the port using aggressive intravenous and oral antibiotics. Treatment of thrombosis of the catheter with either urokinase or streptokinase infusion was successful in ten of 15 attempts. Seventy-two (22 per cent) of SIP were eventually removed, either after completion of the chemotherapy (20) or because of a complication (52) with 29 SIP being replaced. There was no correlation between the risk of infection or thrombosis and the perioperative use of antibiotics, frequency of SIP use or preoperative white blood cell count, platelet count, coagulation profile, blood urea nitrogen or albumen concentration. SIP provide an excellent method of chronic venous access, having a lower rate of infection and thrombosis in historical comparison with external vascular access devices.\r"

  ".W": "Repair of full-thickness burns requires replacement of both the dermal and the epidermal components of the skin. Use of tissue culture methods allows very large expansions of surface area to be covered by cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes (HK). Porous and resorbable materials, such as collagen and chondroitin-6-sulfate membranes, may be expected to adhere to wounds and promote fibrovascular ingrowth better than grafts of cultured epidermal keratinocytes alone. This article demonstrates the in vitro formation of biologic attachments between HK and a collagen and chondroitin-6-sulfate dermal skin replacement. Dermal membranes are prepared as generic acellular sheets and stored in the dry state for extended periods. Subconfluent HK cultures in logarithmic phase growth can attach quickly to dermal membranes in vitro, form a confluent epithelial sheet on the surface of each membrane, and exhibit mitotic cells for at least 1 week in vitro. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates the formation of hemidesmosomes, extracellular matrix, and banded collagen at the interface of the epidermal cells and the dermal membrane. By comparison, HK cultures as confluent sheets released enzymatically with Dispase do not attach to the dermal membranes in vitro, under the conditions tested, although complete coverage of the membrane by the cell sheets is obtained. Growth assays show that subconfluent HK cells retain sufficient growth potential to maintain logarithmic phase growth, but that HK cells disaggregated from confluent sheets become growth arrested in comparison. The composite material has discrete dermal and epidermal compartments, has total thickness comparable to split-thickness skin graft, and can be applied to full-thickness skin defects in a single procedure.\r"

Male inbred Lewis rats sensitized to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were fed either a normal diet or a 2% protein diet for 1, 6, and 10 weeks. Two additional groups were fed a 2% protein diet for 10 weeks but were refed with a normal diet for 1 or 4 weeks. At the end of each diet period rats were injected intradermally with KLH, Staphylococcus aureus 502A, and saline solution at different sites at from 1 to 24 hours. Technetium-99m-colloid labeled PHAGS (99PHAG) were injected intravenously and used to assess in vivo PHAG cell delivery. In normally fed rats the peak influx of 99PHAG was at 2 to 4 hours. After 1 week of protein-deficient diet there was a significant drop in early (2 to 4 hours) 99PHAG influx to both the DTH and bacterial reactions. After 10 weeks of protein deprivation (severe malnutrition) there was a further drop and a delay in the peak 99PHAG influx (from 2 to 4 hours, to 8 hours). A return to normal 99PHAG influx occurred only after 4 weeks of refeeding, and it coincided with a return to normal body weight and a normal DTH reaction. There was a direct correlation between total 99PHAG delivery to a DTH reaction and a bacterial abscess (rs = 0.87, Spearman rank; p less than 0.001). We conclude that both moderate and severe protein deprivation is associated with reduced in vivo phagocytic cell delivery to both a DTH reaction and a bacterial skin abscess, which can be restored with refeeding.\r"

The myocardium extends into the extrapulmonary part of the pulmonary veins in many species, including man. In some small mammals, however, such as the rat, mouse, and bat, it extends further to veins in the peripheral parts of the lung. Since this myocardial layer is continuous with that in the atrium, we have looked for the possible expression of the atrial natriuretic peptide gene in this tissue in rats. Strong immunoreactivity was seen for both the peptide and the N terminal sequence (cardiodilatin) of its precursor in extrapulmonary veins and in intrapulmonary veins extending into the lung as far as the second branching point, where it was localised in the dense cored granules by electron microscopy; in situ hybridisation showed atrial natriuretic peptide messenger RNA at identical sites. Chromatography and radioimmunoassay of extracts of extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary veins showed most of the atrial natriuretic peptide immunoreactivity to be in the uncleaved (precursor molecule) form. Thus the peptide is synthesised in veins both outside and inside the lung, and these extra-atrial sites may be an important additional source of circulating atrial natriuretic peptide.\r"

A study was therefore designed to examine the effect of acetazolamide (250 mg/day) on sleep events and ventilatory control during wakefulness in nine patients with the sleep apnoea syndrome. In eight of the nine patients the apnoea index and the total duration of apnoea were reduced by acetazolamide, and the mean (SEM) apnoea index of all patients changed from 25.0 (6.7) to 18.1 (5.8) episodes an hour. Furthermore, the total time of arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2)--more than 4% depression in SaO2 from the baseline sleeping level--divided by total sleep time was also significantly decreased and its mean (SEM) value improved from 24.1 (7.9) to 13.6 (4.8)% of total sleep time. Five of the seven patients with varying degrees of daytime hypersomnolence had their symptoms obviously improved. There was no patient whose predominant type of apnoea was converted from the obstructive to the central type, or vice versa. In the studies of wakefulness, metabolic acidosis, an increase of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and a decrease of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) were observed. The slopes of the occlusion pressure response and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide increased, and the carbon dioxide ventilatory response line shifted to the left. It is suggested that acetazolamide cannot remove apnoea completely but has a beneficial effect in mild cases of obstructive sleep apnoea through an augmentation of central (CO2, H+) drive and a stabilising effect on ventilatory control.\r"

The assays use four mouse monoclonal radioiodinated antibodies, one that reacts equally well with all four human IgG subclasses and three that are specific for human IgG subclasses 1, 2, or 3. The assays were used to analyze IgG subclass composition in 21 high-titer anti-D samples from Rh-negative volunteers immunized for Rh immunoglobulin production. Anti-D activity was restricted primarily to the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. Eleven of 21 sera demonstrated red cell antibodies with a marked predominance of IgG1 (87 +/- 3.6% of total IgG antibody, +/- SEM) and low levels of IgG3 (1.4 +/- 0.73%). In the remaining 10 sera, IgG3 made up a greater proportion of total IgG antibody (32 +/- 3.8%), although IgG1 was still predominant (61 +/- 4.1%). This observed dichotomy in the IgG subclass profiles of different anti-D sera may be a consideration in the selection of anti-D sera for the production of the immunoglobulin used in the prophylaxis of Rh-incompatible pregnancies.\r"

Each period lasted for 2 weeks. A total of 70 patients (58 men and 12 women) with stable exertional angina pectoris on beta-blockade, mean age 59 years (range 39-71), were included. Exercise testing was performed on a bicycle ergometer 3 hours after the dose at the end of each period. Anginal attacks and intake of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets were noted. Imdur in combination with a beta-blocker significantly increased the total exercise capacity, the time and total work until the onset of chest pain and at 1 mm ST-depression compared with beta-blockade alone. The attack rate and the nitroglycerin consumption were significantly decreased. Headache was the only significant side-effect. In conclusion, the addition of Imdur once daily to beta-blockade significantly increased the anti-anginal effect.\r"

Exercise protocol consisted of three fixed workloads (25, 50, and 75 watts) every 4 minutes with the use of a supine bicycle ergometer. Plasma ANF levels and hemodynamic indices were measured before, during, and 10 minutes after exercise. In the MI group, plasma ANF levels significantly increased at the 75-watt workload and significantly decreased at 10 minutes after exercise, whereas in the control group, the increase in plasma ANP levels after a 75-watt workload, compared with those at rest, was not significant. Significant correlations of pulmonary artery wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate to plasma ANF levels were observed at four points obtained before and during each stage of exercise in the MI group. Furthermore, a significant correlation between maximal creatine kinase levels and plasma ANF levels at a 75-watt workload and a significant inverse correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction and plasma ANF levels at a 75-watt workload were observed. These results suggest that the increase in the circulating ANF level during exercise in MI is associated with elevated atrial pressure resulting from left ventricular dysfunction and that measurement of ANF during exercise may be an indication of the severity of MI and associated left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

Mean PAI activity was significantly higher, and mean t-PA activity after venous occlusion of the upper arm (a standard test of the capacity of vascular endothelium to release t-PA) was significantly lower in subjects with CAD than in subjects with normal coronary arteries. The mean increment in t-PA antigen after venous occlusion was significantly lower than normal in subjects with CAD with onset of symptoms before age 45 years. Subjects with CAD had a significantly increased mean plasma fibrinogen level compared with control subjects, and a significant positive correlation was observed between PAI activity and plasma fibrinogen in subjects with CAD. No significant abnormalities of plasminogen or alpha-2 PI were observed in any subset of subjects with CAD. These data support an association between impaired fibrinolysis and CAD, with contributions from both increased PAI activity and in younger subjects from reduced endothelial t-PA release.\r"

  ".W": "Using serial invasive hemodynamics in concert with noninvasive radionuclide monitoring of left ventricular (LV) function, 20 patients with unstable angina were evaluated during incremental infusion of intravenous nitroglycerin. Of 20 patients, 17 demonstrated a favorable hemodynamic response and dose responses could be determined for individual patients. There was excellent agreement between hemodynamic and noninvasive radionuclide measurements, and patient responses could be inferred from the radionuclide data alone. Cardiac output improved by 29% (mean 4.7 +/- 1.2 to 6.0 +/- 1.3), LV ejection fraction increased an average of 0.11 (0.39 +/- 0.14 to 0.50 +/- 0.16) and diastolic function as assessed by peak filling rate improved from 1.80 +/- 0.60 end-diastolic volumes/s to 2.70 +/- 0.90. Changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were not predictive of hemodynamic response. The dose of nitroglycerin necessary to produce maximal hemodynamic benefit was variable (mean 98 micrograms/min, range 48 to 144). In 7 patients, nitroglycerin caused excessive decreases in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and adverse hemodynamics that corrected with intravenous fluids, allowing continued administration of intravenous nitroglycerin with improvement in hemodynamic status. In 15 patients, peak systolic pressure--end-systolic volume relations were assessed to define possible changes in LV contractility induced during nitroglycerin infusion. In 12 of these patients, this relation was linear, suggesting altered loading rather than augmented contractility as nitroglycerin's mechanism of action. In 3 patients a downward and rightward shift of the systolic relation was seen, suggesting that significant underloading with nitroglycerin was associated with depressed contractility.\r"

Two hundred fifty patients with AMI were transported from within a 150-mile radius to Duke University Medical Center over a 15-month period. All patients were within 12 hours of onset of symptoms. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 240 (96%) patients (72% before or in-flight). The time to administration of thrombolytic therapy ranged from 30 to 120 minutes (median 180), while the time to arrival in the interventional catheterization laboratory ranged from 105 to 815 minutes (median 300). The flight time was 12 to 77 minutes (median 31). Most patients had 1- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease; the baseline ejection fraction ranged from 27 to 70% (median 42). Transient hypotension was the most common complication both pre-flight and in-flight. Third-degree atrioventricular block and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were the next most common complications. Ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred before takeoff in 38 patients (15%). No patients had ventricular fibrillation, asystole or respiratory arrest during transport. Fluid boluses for hypotension were the most common intervention. Five patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation in-flight; 3 before lift-off and 2 required a brief period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation during sustained ventricular tachycardia. Fourteen patients had pressor therapy, military antishock trousers or both to maintain adequate blood pressure. Neither cardioversion, defibrillation nor intubation were performed in-flight. Thus, inflight complications are infrequent and can be managed en route to an intervention center.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For the first 178 patients (group A), 60 mg were given in the first-hour dose and the remaining 90 mg were infused over 7 hours. In the subsequent 208 patients (group B), the first-hour dose was 1.0 mg/kg and the remaining 150 mg were given over 5 hours. At initial angiography 94 +/- 30 minutes into therapy, the infarct vessel patency was 64% in group A versus 75% in group B (p = 0.02). By final angiography with up to 4 selective contrast injections, patency was 68% versus 77%, respectively (p = 0.06). Repeat angiography at 7 to 10 days demonstrated reocclusion in 17% of group A and 13% of group B patients (p = 0.35).

Electrophysiologic studies were performed twice in each of 15 patients (mean age 59 years) with normal resting and intrinsic heart rate and normal A-H interval. In the first study, the variables of sinus node and atrioventricular node were evaluated both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (propranolol 0.2 and atropine 0.04 mg/kg). Oral flecainide was administered for 4 to 5 days (200 to 250 mg daily) and the study was then repeated using the same methods. From comparison of data obtained in the 2 studies in the basal state, the overall effect of flecainide was evaluated and by comparing those obtained after autonomic blockade, the direct action of the drug was assessed. The overall effect of flecainide on sinus node was slight; sinus cycle length, corrected sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time did not change significantly after the drug. In contrast, after autonomic blockade the variables of sinosal automaticity were increased significantly (p less than 0.01). Flecainide significantly prolonged the atrioventricular node variables both in the basal state and after autonomic blockade (p less than 0.01), but the degree of increase was more marked after autonomic blockade (p less than 0.05). These data show dual effects of oral flecainide: a direct depressant action and an autonomically mediated opposing action, likely of vagolytic type.\r"

At the end of the feeding period the IGP group had significantly less colonic inflammation and/or necrosis than either IV (p less than 0.03) or IG (p less than 0.04) groups. Nitrogen balance, serum albumin, total iron-binding capacity and body weight did not differ significantly among dietary regimens.

However, these markers label angiosarcomas inconstantly, which has prompted the search for more reliable markers, especially monoclonal antibodies specific for endothelial cell specific antigens. BMA 120 (formerly designated BW 200) is an endothelial cell specific monoclonal antibody detecting an epitope of a formalin resistant antigen. This marker labels a considerable number of angiosarcoma cells and it was compared with the staining patterns of anti-FVIIIR:Ag and UEA I in 19 angiosarcomas. Special regard was given to the distribution of antibodies in different parts of angiosarcomas.\r"

  ".W": "The literature describing the fall in PaO2 during dialysis is intensively and critically reviewed. This phenomenon is related to both the type of membrane used (cellulosic v noncellulosic membrane), and to the composition of the dialysate (acetate v bicarbonate). It appears that a ventilation/perfusion mismatch due to pulmonary leukostasis can, in part, explain hypoxemia in patients dialyzed with cellulosic membranes. This phenomenon is especially apparent in patients with preexisting pulmonary abnormalities. However, hypoventilation remains the major cause of hypoxemia. This hypoventilation is mainly due to CO2 consumption during acetate metabolism (acetate dialysis), or alkalinization of the blood (bicarbonate dialysis). The metabolic consequences of acetate metabolism, and of bicarbonate and CO2 losses through the dialyzer are critically analyzed. The cause for the increment in oxygen consumption during acetate dialysis is examined. Finally, the respective role of these combined factors are described and used to explain the changes in VCO2, VO2, respiratory quotient (RQ), and PaO2 reported in the literature during dialysis against acetate and/or bicarbonate.\r"

In both the human and baboon placentas, the transport of each agent was similar whether administered singly or in combination with the other drugs. Drug transport was the same in both directions, maternal-to-fetal and vice versa, indicating a lack of preferential transfer. The H2-receptor antagonists were transported at about 40% the rate of the freely diffusable reference compound, antipyrine. There were no significant differences between the human and baboon in any of the parameters of placental function evaluated. Placental glucose and oxygen consumptions, and lactate production were comparable in the human and baboon preparations. The transport and clearance of each of the H2-antagonists were similar in each species.\r"

Prophylaxis was successful in 69 of 70 (98.6%) receiving cefotetan and 32 of 33 (97.0%) receiving cefoxitin who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. Prophylaxis was successful in 160 of 169 (94.7%) receiving cefotetan and in 79 of 83 (95.2%) receiving cefoxitin who underwent abdominal hysterectomy. Both drugs were well tolerated and without serious side effects or complications.

  ".W": "To examine whether keratinocytes (KC) may be a cellular target for the action of cyclosporin A (CsA) in psoriasis and other skin diseases, the direct antiproliferative effect of CsA was examined on rapidly proliferating KCs grown on plastic in serum-free media. CsA at concentrations of 1-10 micrograms/ml directly inhibited KC proliferation over an 8-day incubation period. CsH, an immunologically inert stereoisomer, also inhibited KC proliferation at 5-10 micrograms/ml. When CsA (1 microgram/ml) was combined with gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN; 100 units/ml), there was an additive cytostatic effect on KC proliferation. The potentiating properties of gamma-IFN (100 U/ml) were additive when combined with CsA (1 microgram/ml) and synergistic at a higher concentration of CsA (5 micrograms/ml). The cytostatic effect of CsA (5 micrograms/ml) on KC proliferation was reversible after removal of the drug. Exposure of KCs to CsA resulted in numerous lipid-laden cytoplasmic vacuoles, which began to appear after 24 hours of CsA treatment. The fact that previous reports have documented 1-3 micrograms/ml of CsA and 100 U/ml of gamma-IFN in skin lesions of psoriasis patients suggests that our in vitro results were obtained with the use of physiologically relevant concentrations of these molecules. The direct antiproliferative effects by CsA on KCs suggest that both KCs and lymphocytes may be cellular targets in vivo for the mechanism of action of CsA in psoriasis.\r"

  ".W": "In this study was examined the interaction between schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni and human monocyte-derived macrophages activated with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Peripheral blood monocytes were matured for 6 days and activated by further culture with IFN-gamma (600 U/ml). These IFN-gamma-treated monocyte-derived macrophages are cytotoxic for the tumor cell line K562, which is not killed by nonactivated monocyte-derived macrophages. Activated monocyte-derived macrophages were incubated with schistosomula at ratios of 10(3):1 and 10(4):1 in the presence of serum pooled from patients with schistosomiasis. This antiserum promoted an increased adherence of cells to the parasite. However, the activated monocyte-derived macrophages failed to kill the schistosomula under all conditions tested. On the contrary, the monocyte-derived macrophages were killed by schistosomula in a time-dependent and antibody-dependent manner, which was most evident at a lower effector/target ratio, 200:1. Electron microscopy showed that monocyte-derived macrophages were lysed on the surface of schistosomula. Further, both monocyte-derived macrophages and contaminating blood platelets fused with the parasite surface membrane, so that the cell plasma membrane and the outer tegumental membrane formed a hybrid membrane. The results indicate that matured human monocyte-derived macrophages activated by IFN-gamma are unable to kill schistosomula. Instead, the effector cells fuse with the parasites and are lysed by them.\r"

Medicare discharges as a per cent of total discharges remained constant between 1983 and 1985, but the per cent of uninsured patients increased, especially at large public hospitals. The number of Medicare and total discharges per hospital declined. The number of complex diagnosis related groups (DRGs) increased, both for Medicare and non-Medicare. This trend began before the implementation of PPS and affected all types of hospitals. There was also an appreciable increase in case mix types of hospitals. There was also an appreciable increase in case mix severity within specific DRGs during 1980-85. The proportion of total patients received from or transferred to other hospitals rose after 1983, but these increases were very small. The per cent of Medicare patients admitted through the emergency room increased, especially after 1983. By contrast, the share of total non-Medicare admissions through the emergency room (ER) remained stable. Although the growth of the number of uninsured and Medicare patients admitted through the ER predate PPS, they may be influenced by it and warrant further monitoring.\r"

Sera from patients with schistosomiasis mansoni also contain these activities. Because these three helminthic infections often occur in the same areas, and concomitantly in patients, anti-schistosomular reactivity should not be ascribed only to exposure to schistosomes. The demonstration and definition of these surface-specific cross-reactivities point out the problems of serodiagnosis, and the potential of interactive influences in the common occurrence of multiple helminthic infections in humans.\r"

The receiver operating characteristic for each test showed that the indirect immunoperoxidase and indirect fluorescent antibody tests were more sensitive and specific than the Weil-Felix test using convalescent and acute as well as paired sera. The indirect immunoperoxidase test showed no cross-reactivity when R. tsutsugamushi antigen was tested against sera collected from patients living outside the scrub typhus-endemic area with diseases other than scrub typhus. The indirect immunoperoxidase and indirect fluorescent antibody tests were comparable in measured response to R. tsutsugamushi, R. typhi, and TT-118 (spotted fever group) antigen.

Thirty-seven (44%) were identified as Toscana virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus) and 47 (56%) as a new member of the Phlebotomus fever serogroup, Arbia virus. The characteristics of this new serotype are described. The overall virus isolation rate from sand flies was 0.5 per 100 insects processed. Virus isolation rates for both viruses were similar in different years and in the two localities, suggesting that the two virus types were active in the sand fly population simultaneously. Each year, the largest number of isolates were obtained during July, corresponding to the period of maximal sand fly population density. Both viruses were repeatedly isolated from male sand flies, suggesting transovarial transmission in nature. Serologic data showed no evidence of infection among domestic and wild animals. However, a strain of Toscana virus was isolated from the brain of a bat (Pipistrellus kuhli), indicating a possible involvement of this species in the ecology of the virus. Serologic tests did not provide definitive evidence for human infection by Arbia virus.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that a decrease in cardiac output during infrarenal aortic cross-clamping is related to a decrease in oxygen consumption in the perfused tissues (cross-clamp-adapted oxygen consumption) rather than to deterioration of myocardial performance has been tested. Twenty-two patients undergoing excision of an aortic abdominal aneurysm were randomly divided into two groups of equal number. During aortic cross-clamping, Group 1 patients received nitroglycerin infusion, 1 to 2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, whereas Group 2 patients did not receive a nitroglycerin infusion. During aortic cross-clamping, cross-clamp-adapted body oxygen consumption decreased equally in both groups by 40 to 42 percent of baseline values, whereas cardiac output decreased by 17 percent in Group 2 but did not change significantly in Group 1. Mixed venous oxygen content increased significantly after induction of anesthesia and prior to aortic cross-clamping in both groups. During cross-clamping, the values of mixed venous oxygen content remained increased in Group 2 and increased further in Group 1. The data support our hypothesis since a decrease in cardiac output was not associated with an increase in filling pressures during aortic cross-clamping, but was instead associated with an increase in mixed venous oxygen content and a decrease in the arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Nitroglycerin infusion was associated with a further increase in mixed venous oxygen content during aortic cross-clamping and a decrease in the arteriovenous oxygen content difference, without a concomitant increase in oxygen utilization.\r"

The 40% Ventimask gave the most consistent, satisfactory postoperative values of PaO2 but the much cheaper nasal cannula at 6 or 9 litres/minute was generally adequate in conscious patients. The performance of the intermediately priced Hudson mask was similar to that of the nasal cannula at these flows. The unconscious state was associated with a 45% lower PaO2 than the rousable or awake states. Differences between the treatments with regard to postoperative PaCO2 were small and non-significant.

Fifteen minutes after IM injection, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 decreased significantly (from 2.72 +/- 0.34 to 1.8 +/- 0.20 L.min-1.mmHg-1) while assessment of periosteal analgesia showed no change. After epidural injection, the slope of the ventilatory response to CO2 decreased significantly (from 2.32 +/- 0.42 to 1.61 +/- 0.29, 1.51 +/- 0.29, and 1.53 +/- 0.21 L.min-1.mm Hg-1) at 15, 45, and 90 minutes (x +/- SD, P less than 0.05), and there was significant periosteal analgesia of the tibia (15 and 30 minutes after injection) and of the radius (30 to 90 minutes after injection). Throughout the study, plasma alfentanil levels were similar after intramuscular and epidural injection. These results suggest that epidural alfentanil induces ventilatory depression due to the rostral spread of the drug rather than to systemic absorption.\r"

  ".W": "Regional (frontal, parietal, occipital, cortical, and basal ganglia) cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was examined at 1.5 and 3.5 MAC inspired isoflurane/O2 anesthesia in the rat using the radioactive microsphere technique to determine the effects of controlled hypotension with deep isoflurane anesthesia on rCBF and the response of rCBF to changes in PaCO2 when mean blood pressure (BP) was decreased to levels below the lower limit of the autoregulatory threshold. Four groups of six rats were studied with rCBF 1 determined at 1.5 MAC (mean BP 80-90 mm Hg) followed by two rCBF determinations at 3.5 MAC (mean BP 46-48 mm Hg). For CBF 1 the regional CO2 response was a 3.1-3.9% increase in rCBF/mm Hg increase in CO2. Regional cerebral blood flow (ml/g/min) ranged from 0.64 +/- 0.05-0.83 +/- 0.15 at PaCO2 of 19 mm Hg to 1.34 +/- 0.11-1.80 +/- 0.33 at PaCO2 of 41 mm Hg to 2.61 +/- 0.26-3.72 +/- 0.37 at PaCO2 of 59 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). With controlled hypotension (CBF 2) rCBF was unchanged during normocarbia, increased 100% during hypocarbia, P less than 0.01 vs CBF 1 and decreased 30% during hypercarbia, P less than 0.01 vs CBF 1. For rCBF 3 measurements, the BP and inspired concentration of isoflurane were kept constant, while PaCO2 was increased in two and decreased in two of the four groups. Within-group comparisons between rCBF 2 and rCBF 3 results demonstrated loss of CO2 responsiveness of the rat cerebrovasculature in every region during controlled hypotension to below the autoregulatory threshold at 3.5 MAC isoflurane/O2 anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using this model, the pulmonary and systemic effects of nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, hydralazine, and prostaglandin E1 were compared at doses producing equivalent reductions in systemic blood pressure. Although all four drugs decreased pulmonary artery pressure and resistance, different drug hemodynamic profiles were found. Prostaglandin E1 demonstrated the greatest pulmonary specificity and resulted in the largest decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (from 33 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 1 mmHg). Nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside demonstrated intermediate pulmonary specificity and did not affect cardiac output. Hydralazine demonstrated the least pulmonary specificity and resulted in a large decrease in systemic vascular resistance, with only a moderate decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance. Rational selection of pulmonary vasodilators for clinical application will vary depending on baseline heart rate and rhythm, pulmonary artery pressure, systemic artery pressure, and cardiac output.\r"

We here report the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) as a measure of T-cell activation in serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in 15 patients with active sarcoidosis. The geometric mean (x divided by SEM) value for soluble IL-2R in serum samples from patients with sarcoidosis was 1,110 (x divided by 1.17) versus 224 (x divided by 1.08) U/ml for normal control subjects (p less than 0.001). Detectable levels of soluble IL-2R were present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from 10 of 15 patients with sarcoidosis versus only 2 of 36 normal control subjects (p less than 0.001). Levels of soluble IL-2R in serum samples from untreated patients with sarcoidosis correlated with 67gallium lung scanning scores (p less than 0.05) but not with serum angiotensin-converting enzyme concentrations or constituents of bronchoalveolar lavage. In 5 patients, the level of soluble IL-2R in serum samples fell from 1,499 (x divided by 1.20) to 476 (x divided by 1.58) U/ml (p less than 0.05) after 6 wk of successful treatment with corticosteroids, whereas the changes in soluble IL-2R in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were more variable. These observations suggest that measurements of soluble IL-2R, particularly in serum samples, may reflect disease activity and be clinically useful in the management of patients with sarcoidosis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to characterize hospital resource consumption and outcome by age for pulmonary patients. All pulmonary medicine admissions treated at a large academic medical center from January 1, 1985 through December 31, 1986 were analyzed using the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) format. Total costs (exclusive of physician fees) for the 2,647 pulmonary patients studied were $19,751,192. Mean hospital cost per patient, hospital length of stay, percentage of outliers, and mortality increased with age. Under the DRG reimbursement mechanism (i.e., All Payor System), a loss was incurred for all patients 45 yr of age and older, which led to an overall fiscal deficit for pulmonary medicine admissions. Medicare patients (n = 930) demonstrated a stronger expression of these trends. DRG case-mix index and the mean number of diagnoses per patient increased steadily with age. Emergency admissions were highest for the young (i.e., 18 to 35 yr of age), for some middle-aged (i.e., 45 to 65 yr of age), and for the very old (80 yr of age). Utilization of the intensive care unit and blood transfusions was higher for older patients; utilization of plasma products showed a more variable pattern, although older patients had greater consumption than their younger cohorts. This study demonstrated several trends with regard to resource utilization and age for pulmonary patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All laboratory tests ordered, the results of those tests and the number of test results available before patient disposition from the ED were reviewed. A total of 626 laboratory studies were ordered in 166 patients. Results from only 68.5 per cent of the laboratory tests were available in the ED prior to the patient's transfer from the ED. Only 6.4 per cent of these results were abnormal. This low incidence of abnormal test results and preadmission availability questions the utility of extensive initial routine laboratory evaluations of the pediatric trauma patient. Based on this data, the current protocol has been revised to include hemoglobin/hematocrit determinations, type and screen, and urinalysis. Additional blood is obtained and appropriately labeled so that further studies can be performed if the patient's management should require baseline laboratory evaluations. This approach is more efficient, cost-effective, and no less sensitive in the initial evaluation and management of the injured child.\r"

The first urine samples of the morning were collected and excretion of proteins measured was expressed as ratio of protein to creatinine. There was a strong correlation between excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin and chi light chains and their excretion was significantly higher in diabetic children indicating decreased proximal tubular reabsorbtion. The excretion of beta-2-microglobulin was found to be an unsatisfactory index of proximal tubular function. Urinary albumin excretion was not significantly raised in diabetic children and did not correlate with urinary alpha-1-microglobulin or chi light chain excretion. Glycaemic control might influence proximal tubular function as both urinary glucose concentration and glycosylated haemoglobin showed correlations with urinary alpha-1-microglobulin excretion and with urinary chi light chain excretion.\r"

Analyses of human adipose tissues for these congeners revealed 94-860 pg/g of T4CB, 120-730 pg/g of P5CB, and 36-200 pg/g of H6CB on wet weight basis. These were significantly higher than 2,3,7,8-T4CDD detected in the same samples (less than 1-18 pg/g). On the basis of in vitro and in vivo induction of hepatic microsomal benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase (AHH) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), \"T4CDD toxic equivalents\" were calculated for coplanar PCBs in humans. \"T4CDD toxic equivalent\" for 3,3',4,4',5-P5CB was one order of magnitude higher than 2,3,7,8-T4CDD. Considering the extreme toxic potential and persistence of coplanar PCBs, their presence in the human body may pose a greater toxic threat than dioxins and dibenzofurans.\r"

  ".W": "A cross-over design study was used to examine the metabolic consequences of enteral feeding for 48 to 96 hours with either a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched (44% BCAA) or a conventional egg protein formulation in 12 severely burned adult patients. A stable isotope labeled leucine (L-1-13C-leucine) tracer approach was used to measure leucine flux and oxidation and to estimate rates of whole body protein synthesis and breakdown. Additionally, 15N2-urea and 6,6-2H-glucose were administered to assess the status of urea and glucose kinetics with these two nutritional treatments. Average patient age was 54 years, and average burn surface area was 36%. Studies were conducted at an average of 25 days postburn. Leucine flux and oxidation were significantly (p less than 0.01, by paired t-test) elevated with BCAA feeding as compared to the egg protein formulation. However, there were no significant differences in the rates of leucine incorporation into, or release from, proteins (p greater than 0.05) between the two dietary periods. Mean rates of body protein synthesis and breakdown for each diet were about twice the rates reported for healthy young adults. Apparent nitrogen balance measurements were not statistically different (p greater than 0.1) between the two diet periods. Furthermore, urea and glucose kinetics failed to show significant differences between the two diet periods. It appears from these results that the major consequences of increased intake of leucine from the BCAA formula is an enhanced rate of leucine oxidation. In conclusion, (1) the availability of BCAAs is not rate-limiting for enhanced protein synthesis in burn patients, and (2) the use of enriched BCAA formulas in burn therapy does not appear to offer advantages over a routinely used enteral egg protein formula, at least based on the present determinations.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to analyze hospital resource consumption for Medicare patients in non-age- and age-stratified medical diagnosis related groups (DRGs). This study of patients in 74 non-age-stratified DRGs (N = 3643) and 113 age-stratified DRGs (N = 2898) demonstrated that older medical patients (usually greater than or equal to 75 to 80 years of age) had (on average) higher total hospital costs, a longer hospital length of stay, more diagnoses per patient, a greater percentage of outliers, and a higher mortality compared with younger patients in these same DRGs. These findings raise the question of the equity of DRG payment vis-a-vis older Medicare patients in both non-age- and age-stratified medical DRGs. Financial disincentives to treat older medical patients may limit both their access and quality of care in the future.\r"

The procedure was performed on 82 patients with biopsy-proved systemic amyloidosis and 72 normal adult volunteers. Slides from 71 of the 72 controls were read as negative. Slides from 59 (72%) of the 82 patients with amyloidosis were read as positive or weakly positive after staining with alkaline Congo red. Subcutaneous fat aspiration was as sensitive as rectal biopsy and substantially more sensitive than bone marrow biopsy in diagnosing amyloidosis. In six instances fat aspiration would have obviated the need for a more invasive diagnostic biopsy. Subcutaneous fat aspiration is sensitive (72%) and specific (99%) for amyloidosis. It is technically simpler and less expensive than rectal biopsy and permits immediate assessment of specimen adequacy. The concordance rate for two independent pathologists was 95%. Equivocally positive stains should be interpreted with caution because weak nonspecific staining may be seen.\r"

We tested the effects of tPA in several models of embolic stroke and found that neurologic damage was reduced when the drug was administered as late as 45 minutes after cerebral embolic occlusion. The mechanism of therapeutic efficacy of tPA was probably thrombolysis. Drug-induced hemorrhages did not occur when therapy was started within four hours after the onset of vascular occlusion. These results suggest that tPA may be useful for thrombolytic therapy of embolic stroke if the drug is administered rapidly after the onset of vascular occlusion.\r"

This article focuses on the cost-effectiveness of systems staffed with each type of EMT. Data were collected from all 50 states and from the District of Columbia to determine the number of hours and estimated cost of initial training for the three types of EMTs in the United States in 1986. The median initial training hours for basic EMTs, EMTs trained in defibrillation, and paramedics were 110, 129, and 700, respectively. Median costs for initial training at each EMT level were +123, +150, and +1580/student. According to published survival data for emergency medical systems staffed with EMTs at each level, the total initial training personnel and equipment cost per life saved from ventricular fibrillation was +7687, +2126, and +2289 for systems staffed by the respective EMTs. The initial cost per life saved from ventricular fibrillation is more than three times greater in systems staffed by basic EMTs than in systems staffed by EMTs trained in defibrillation or paramedics. From a medical and a cost-effective standpoint, all communities served by basic EMTs should consider upgrading them to at least the defibrillation-trained EMT level.\r"

Under a prospective payment system, the charge per patient was +1187 greater, the reimbursement per patient was +1137 greater, and the profit per patient was +1063 greater for observing patients in the hospital rather than in the observation unit (p less than 0.001). This difference in reimbursement can be a great financial incentive for hospitals to admit patients rather than to observe them in the emergency department. Significant savings might be realized for the health care payer by optimal use of observation units under a prospective payment or cost reimbursement system.\r"

Values of cardiac output obtained by electrical bioimpedance cardiography (BoMed NCCOM3 machine) were compared with values derived from an indirect Fick technique that uses carbon dioxide rebreathing (Gould 9000 IV system) during 103 simultaneous measurements made at rest in 19 randomly selected subjects and on exercise in 11 subjects. Cardiac output values obtained with impedance cardiography were significantly correlated with those measured by the indirect Fick method, although there was a wide scatter with over 73% of the readings lying outside the limits defined by the line of identity +/- 20%. This correlation was greatly reduced when stroke volume index was used instead of cardiac output. Indirect Fick results were linearly related to oxygen uptake both at rest and on exercise, while impedance cardiography results did not correlate with oxygen uptake. Impedance cardiography gave consistently lower results for cardiac output than indirect Fick at all levels of exercise. Both machines were easy to use and produced acceptable mean (SE) coefficients of variation (BoMed NCCOM3 7.7 (1.0)%, Gould 9000 IV 10.6 (1.4)%). Further validation is required before either of these machines can be recommended as an alternative to invasive monitoring in clinical practice.\r"

Following the induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone (given over 2 min) and the administration of atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1, patients received alfentanil 400, 600, 800 or 1000 micrograms. Intubation of the trachea was performed 90 s later. Heart rate was monitored continuously and systolic arterial pressure was measured at 1-min intervals for 3 min before induction, and both variables were monitored until 10 min had elapsed after tracheal intubation. In each of the groups there was a significant decrease in systolic arterial pressure and a significant increase in heart rate on induction of anaesthesia. In those patients who received either 400 or 600 micrograms of alfentanil, arterial pressure increased immediately after tracheal intubation, whereas in those receiving alfentanil 800 or 1000 micrograms, arterial pressure decreased immediately after tracheal intubation, and when measured 10 min after intubation. It is suggested that alfentanil 600 micrograms (10 micrograms kg-1) constitutes the optimal dose with which to obtund the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation in elderly patients, and to minimize cardiovascular depression after tracheal intubation.\r"

Rectal, muscle and skin temperatures, blood lactate concentration and venous PCO2 were measured before, during and after anaesthesia. Susceptibility to MH was established by in vitro contracture tests according to the protocol of the European MH Group. Twenty patients were susceptible to MH (MHS), 19 were MH non-susceptible (MHN) and five MH equivocal (MHE). No adverse effects of the drugs were observed. There were no differences between the three groups in rectal or muscle temperature, blood lactate concentration or venous PCO2 at any time. Doxapram did not prevent an increase in postoperative PCO2. It is concluded that vecuronium and doxapram may be safely administered to patients susceptible to MH.\r"

They allow for the selective elimination of alveolar gas in association with both spontaneous and controlled ventilation. A comparison with the Bain system in controlled ventilation demonstrates greater efficiency in eliminating carbon dioxide. A fresh gas flow (VF) of 70 ml kg-1 min-1 using an EAR system gave mild hypocarbia which equated to a VF of 100 ml kg-1 min-1 using the Bain system. Smaller minute volumes of ventilation are required for optimal performance than with the Bain system. The minimum recommended minute volume of ventilation (VI) should equal VF plus anatomical deadspace ventilation (VDanat). The pattern of ventilation appears to have little influence upon the efficiency of carbon dioxide elimination when using an EAR system, whereas the Bain system does appear to be affected.\r"

In the present study, prostaglandin E, a hormonal activator of adenylate cyclase that has antiproliferative activity in myeloid cells, and cholera toxin, an adenylate cyclase agonist that functions at a postreceptor site by activating the adenylate cyclase stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs), were studied for antiproliferative activity in two murine myeloid cell lines. FDC-P1, an interleukin 3 (IL 3)-dependent myeloid cell line and a tumorigenic IL 3-independent subline, FI, were resistant to these antiproliferative agents. The in vitro ability of the \"differentiation\" agent, sodium butyrate, to reverse their resistance to adenylate cyclase agonists was studied. The antiproliferative action of butyrate involved augmentation of transmembrane adenylate cyclase activity. Increased adenylate cyclase catalyst activity was the primary alteration of this transmembrane signaling group leading to the functional inhibitory effects on leukemia cells, although alterations in regulatory G-proteins appear to play a secondary role.\r"

Sixty HTLV-I seronegative, age-matched controls showed a normal range of form 63.2 to 480.8 U/mL. All asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-I had sIL 2R in their sera within the normal range. sIL 2R in sera was not related to the anti-HTLV-I antibody titer. Eleven patients with acute ATL, a clinical phenotype with median survival rate of 4.4 months, had markedly elevated sIL 2R (11,100 to 99,000 U/mL), but eight patients with smoldering ATL had low sIL 2R values (less than 480.8 U/mL) comparable to controls. Eleven patients with chronic ATL had intermediate elevated levels of sIL 2R (480.8 to 37,300.0 U/mL). Serum levels of sIL 2R correlated with the number of ATL cells (r = 0.812) and CD25-positive cells (r = 0.725) circulating in the peripheral blood. Longitudinal studies performed in four patients with ATL showed significant correlation between serum concentration of sIL 2R and activity of the malignancy. These findings suggest that the level of sIL 2R in serum indicated tumor load and, possibly, prognosis.\r"

These parameters were analyzed following a five-day culture with the cytokines. Chemotactic peptide receptor expression was studied using the fluoresceinated hexapeptide, formyl-norleucyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-norleucyl-tyrosyl-lysine and flow cytometry. Actin polymerization, an important event required for chemotaxis and phagocytosis, was studied using NBD-phallacidin labeling, following stimulation with the chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). TNF increased the expression of chemotactic peptide receptors in a dose-dependent fashion, and there was good correlation between the receptor expression, stimulus-induced actin polymerization, H2O2 production, and NSE positivity. IFN-gamma was less potent in inducing all the parameters studied but exerted a positive cooperative effect when combined with TNF. IFN-gamma at high concentrations induced chemotactic peptide receptors comparable in magnitude to that seen with TNF but failed to prime these cells to undergo actin polymerization in response to FMLP or PMA. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells showed a decrease in F-actin content on stimulation with PMA. This suggests that protein kinase C might have a negative regulatory role in stimulus-induced actin polymerization. The observations reported here indicate that appropriate combinations of different inducing agents with different modes of action might be necessary to duplicate the functional abilities of mature phagocytic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoglobulin (Ig) or idiotype (Id) is a tumor-specific target in those B cell malignancies that express this molecule on their surface. We explored the biology of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B cell ALL) using Id as a tumor marker. In this report we describe the development of anti-Id monoclonal antibodies (MAB) for two children with B cell ALL. These reagents were used retrospectively to study tumor kinetics and to detect residual disease after chemotherapy. In both cases serum Id values were strikingly high at diagnosis (1.2 mg/mL and 10.8 mg/mL), suggesting that the tumor cells were relatively mature B cells capable of significant antibody production. In both patients the serum Id levels fell with the institution of therapy and confirmed that the patients were in remission. Increasing serum Id predicted relapse four months before conventional methods in patient 1, and Id proved to be a more sensitive measure of tumor burden than Southern blot analysis of rearranged Ig genes in bone marrow samples. Surprisingly, low levels of Id were redetected in the second patient just before completing therapy and have persisted for over a year despite the absence of clinical evidence of recurrent disease. Thus, serum Id levels reflect tumor burden during initial therapy but may not necessarily predict tumor progression after a complete clinical remission.\r"

  ".W": "Human liver transplantation is frequently associated with a coagulopathy and bleeding diathesis developing during the anhepatic phase of surgery. The hemostatic defect has been attributed in part to accelerated fibrinolysis. In this study we evaluated changes in specific blood fibrinolytic parameters occurring in eight adult patients undergoing first-time orthotopic liver transplantation. Five of the eight patients experienced moderate to severe systemic fibrinolysis as reflected by alpha 2-antiplasmin consumption and fibrinogen degradation with the concomitant appearance of fibrin(ogen) degradation products. In association with these changes, an increase in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and t-PA antigen levels was also observed. Fibrinolysis was most pronounced during the anhepatic phase of surgery and decreased after revascularization of the grafted liver. Three additional patients who underwent the same procedure manifested much less evidence of systemic fibrinolytic activation and had minimal elevation of t-PA antigen levels or activity. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator levels, although elevated in three patients, were disassociated from increased t-PA levels and concomitant systemic fibrinolysis. The operative course of those patients developing t-PA-associated fibrinolysis was characterized by shock, acidosis, generalized bleeding, and a need for substantially greater blood product support during surgery. These findings suggest that the observed fibrinolytic defect is related to increased circulating plasma levels of t-PA, presumably resulting from a combination of increased intravascular release and decreased hepatic clearance of t-PA. These observations may have implications for intraoperative therapy for the transplant-related coagulopathy and its associated bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical significance of interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) concentrations in serum was determined for 344 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Serum levels of IL2R in patients (267 to 80,000 U/mL, median 2,007 U/mL) were significantly higher than normal control values (170 to 738 U/mL, median 347 U/mL) (P less than .0001). Measurements in cases of T cell ALL were lower than in the non-T, non-B cases (P = .02). Among the 264 patients with non-T, non-B ALL, but not in those with T cell disease, higher serum IL2R levels (greater than 2,000 U/mL) were associated with a poorer treatment outcome (P = .04). In a multivariate analysis, serum IL2R level contributed independent prognostic information beyond that conveyed by leukocyte count, race, and age (P = .04). One explanation for these results is that soluble IL2R competes with normal lymphocyte-integrated IL2R for the ligand and thus could suppress host antitumor immunity.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) on leukemic cells of natural killer (NK) and T cell lineages in two patients with large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia was examined. The p55 Tac IL-2R was not detected by the indirect immunofluorescence method and it did not participate in the IL-2 binding to the surface of these cells. However, these leukemic cells proliferated in a IL-2 dose-dependent manner and expressed p55. A p75 IL-2 receptor (IL-2-R) subunit was detected on the LGL leukemic cells of both NK and T lineages in a crosslink assay. Thus, it is suggested that the primary signal of IL-2 is mediated by the p75 alone. A study of the inhibitions of the proliferative response of LGL leukemia cells by anti-Tac revealed that both p75 and secondarily induced p55 are required for the cell proliferation.\r"

Because of previous discrepant results, all purification steps and CHO modifications by various enzymes were critically evaluated. Under our conditions, CHO-modified vWF preparations contained less than 5% of the initial sialic acid ([Neu]-ase-vWF) and less than 45% ([Neu-Gal]-ase-vWF) or 21% ([Neu-Gal-eF]-ase-vWF) of the D-galactose. These preparations usually showed increased electrophoretic mobility but no significant loss of high-mol-wt multimers when proteolysis had been prevented. Some degree of proteolysis was noted in some carbohydrate-modified vWFs, but the degree of degradation observed did not correlate with the removal of D-galactose. Platelet adhesion to various matrices increased after removal of the terminal sialic acid ([Neu]-ase-vWF) and approximately 45% of the D-galactose ([Neu-Gal]-ase-vWF), but returned to normal values when greater than 70% of the total carbohydrate had been removed by endoglycosidase F [Neu-Gal-ef]-ase-vWF). These changes in reactivity were also reflected in the spontaneous aggregation in normal platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after CHO removal.\r"

Earlier workers reported rearrangement of this gene (located on chromosome 18) in a major fraction of follicular lymphomas, lymphomas in which a 14;18 chromosome translocation is frequently observed. In the present study, bcl-2 was rearranged in 30% (11 of 37) of follicular lymphomas and 19% (11 of 58) of diffuse lymphomas of follicle center cell lineage. In 18 of 19 samples studied, the rearranged bcl-2 fragment also hybridized with a probe for the joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene located on chromosome 14, indicating a 14;18 translocation. In lymphomas not derived from follicle center cells, ie, diffuse lymphomas of small B lymphocytes, B-CLL and T cell neoplasms, the bcl-2 gene was always in germline configuration. The frequent rearrangement of bcl-2 in a variety of B cell lymphomas of diffuse morphology (small cleaved cell, large cell, small noncleaved cell and immunoblastic) is noteworthy.\r"
