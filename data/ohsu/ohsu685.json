Artistic skills are needed, along with knowledge of anatomy and physiology of the nose, and recognition of factors that produced the problem. The standards of our society demand consistently good results: a surgeon performing rhinoplasty is considered proficient only after approximately 8 years of experience and continuing education. The unpredictable response of nasal tissues to the surgery can present a humbling experience to the surgeon who critically evaluates his or her results.\r"

The mandibular molar teeth were extracted in five adult female monkeys, followed by massive alveolectomy. Five to eight months later, PPSF + DBP was inserted subperiosteally on the left side, while PPSF alone was inserted on the right side. The animals were killed 42, 60, and 90 days following implantation. Specimens were processed for light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, tetracycline labeling, and histomorphometric measurement of new bone. The 42-day specimens of the PPSF + DBP and PPSF revealed penetration of fibrous tissue rich in fibroblasts and blood vessels into the pores of the PPSF. At 60 and 90 days, the PPSF side showed organized fibrous tissue, but bone grew only for a short distance into the implant. In contrast, the PPSF + DBP side showed large amounts of bone formation, and bone almost covered the implant. The qualitative results were confirmed by histomorphometric examination.\r"

Using a smoking continuum developed from that survey as an index, it was postulated that a hard-core group of smokers would be overrepresented in some categories of this continuum in certain groups of the population. In this survey, more women than men who had quit in the preceding year had relapsed to smoking by the time of the survey. However, the fact that similar proportions of men and women had quit smoking for between one and five years suggested that the difference might not have involved the proportion who relapsed but only the timing of that relapse. Smokers over the age of 65 are more likely both to attempt to quit and to continue abstaining than those between ages 25 and 64. Results from this survey do not indicate a major group of smokers who either resist change or who feel unable to quit successfully.\r"

Previous studies have found smoking to be highly correlated with age, social class, and occupational stress, among other factors. It is uncertain whether race is an independent predictor of smoking rates or whether it is primarily a correlate of other demographic variables. Loglinear modeling and logit regression analysis suggested that racial differences between Blacks and Whites in smoking may be spurious. The multivariate analysis established that class and stress differences remained more potent than race in accounting for variations in smoking behavior.\r"

Age-specific prevalence rate curves were constructed by using the estimated smoking rates among 8-, 18-, 28-, 38-, 48-, and 58-year-olds from 1923 to 1983. Age-specific rates were higher for men than for women. However, rates declined over time among all age groups of Mexican-American men, and among Cuban-American and Puerto Rican-American men older than 18 years. In contrast, rates for Mexican-American women did not change appreciably over time, but they increased markedly for 28- and 38-year-old Cuban-American women and most age groups of Puerto Rican-American women. These results suggest that rates of cigarette smoking among Hispanic women are beginning to converge with those of Hispanic men, and that rates of smoking initiation among Cuban-American boys and Puerto Rican-American boys and girls have either remained unchanged or increased markedly over time.\r"

There is no corresponding increase in the overall incidence of lung cancer in the general population of the United States. Cigarette smoking is clearly the primary risk factor in this group and the role of passive smoking remains controversial. Various other etiologic factors, including a shift in occupational exposure, may play a minor role in the development of lung cancer in years after smoking cessation. If the incidence of smoking in American women was reduced to pre-1950 levels, it is estimated that lung cancer in women would once again become a rare finding after the year 2000.\r"

During the 28 months of the study, 526 cases of pertussis were identified (overall yearly incidence: 74 cases per 100,000 population). Laboratory confirmation was obtained in 168 (32%) cases, including 111 (21%) by culture. Peak incidence occurred among children 2 to 5 years of age; the highest morbidity rate was seen in children less than 1 year of age. Hospitalization was required for 22 (4.2%) patients; 14 (64%) of those hospitalized were less than 1 year of age. Most (91%) patients had received at least three doses of pertussis vaccine; vaccine efficacy was estimated at 45%. The surveillance program demonstrated that the incidence of pertussis in Nova Scotia, although among the highest in North America, is still underestimated. A ninefold increase in cases was identified over the comparable period of the previous year, largely because patients meeting clinical criteria were reported. By supplementing culture techniques with immunofluorescent staining and serologic methods, we increased the rate of laboratory confirmation from 17% to 65%, suggesting that strict clinical criteria accurately reflect accurately reflect incidence. We conclude that pertussis remains a significant health problem in Nova Scotia, despite nearly universal vaccination.\r"

In the multivariate analysis, day care outside the home was found to increase the risk of invasive Hib disease (odds ratio 5, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 11), with the highest risk among children less than 2 years of age; this risk was significantly higher within the first month of attendance than later on (p = 0.02). The existence of siblings less than 7 years of age was found to be a risk factor, especially for the younger children (odds ratio 8.6, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 52 for children less than 1 year of age), and the odds ratio increased approximately twofold with each additional sibling. A history of otitis media and previous hospitalizations were further risk factors for invasive Hib disease (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.9, and odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 3.4, respectively). Breast-feeding for longer than 6 months was found to be protective (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 0.9). The amount of Hib disease in different populations will vary with the incidence of these risk factors.\r"

Forty-five patients had esophagitis; in 18 (40%) of these patients, pain replicating their usual symptoms developed during esophageal acid perfusion, whereas in 15 patients without esophagitis, chest pain did not develop during esophageal acid perfusion. In three patients with esophagitis, esophageal manometric abnormalities and chest pain developed as a result of esophageal acid perfusion. Treatment with either ranitidine or antacids had equivalent effectiveness. We conclude that a positive Bernstein test result in children with nonspecific chest pain indicates that the pain is likely associated with esophageal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty short, slowly growing children with normal plasma growth hormone response to standard provocation tests were randomly assigned to a group (n = 20) undergoing therapy with methionyl growth hormone, 2 IU/m2 subcutaneously once daily, (group 1) or a control group (n = 10, group 2). The mean (+/- SD) height velocity increment in group 1 was 3.0 +/- 1.9 cm/yr in the first year, compared with -0.2 +/- 0.7 cm/yr in group 2. Of the 18 children who completed the first year of treatment, 12 had a height velocity increment of more than 2 cm/yr and 11 of them continued treatment for a second year (group 1A). The remaining six children also reached height velocities greater than the mean for bone age, but because of a low height velocity increment they were termed nonresponders and their growth hormone dosage was increased to 4 IU/m2/day (group 1B). Of the 10 children in the control group, seven received authentic biosynthetic growth hormone in the second year of the study (group 2); the remaining three received no therapy (group 3). The mean height velocities (measured in centimeters per year) before and during the first and second years of therapy were 3.6, 7.6, and 6.1 in group 1A; 5.7, 6.9, and 7.3 in group 1B; 4.2, 4.0, and 6.7 in group 2; and 5.0, 4.9, and 5.2 in group 3. The effect of doubling the dosage was a further increase of 1.9 cm/yr. Bone age advance paralleled growth acceleration, resulting in an unchanged height standard deviation score for bone age and ambiguous results on final height prediction. Growth hormone therapy in such short children appears to be safe and efficacious in increasing growth velocity for 2 years, but its efficacy in terms of increasing final height is uncertain.\r"

  ".W": "The relative importance of endogenous metabolism and urinary metabolite excretion was assessed in vivo in six children with methylmalonic acidemia by examining the kinetics of the immediate precursor to methylmalonate, propionate. Total production and oxidation of propionate were measured by means of a continuous infusion of (1-13C)propionate and were compared with the urinary excretion of propionate metabolites. Propionate oxidation was substantial (mean 48.9 mumol/kg/hr +/- SD 18.0) and, in four children, exceeded urinary metabolite excretion (mean urinary excretion in all subjects 40 mumol/kg/hr +/- 25). The sum of urinary excretion and oxidation rates (88 mumol/kg/hr +/- 29) approximated the total propionate production (93.4 +/- 37.0), suggesting that these routes together constitute the major mechanisms of propionate disposal. These results suggest that propionate oxidation is an important route of disposal in methylmalonic acidemia. Variations in the relative proportions of propionate disposal through oxidation and urinary excretion may be one reason for the often poor correlation between clinical status and urinary metabolite excretion. Measurement of urinary metabolite concentration alone may not always reflect clinical status and responses to treatment accurately.\r"

After 6 weeks, radiographs from all infants were scored blindly for degree of radiographic bone disease, and serum osteocalcin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured. Mean vitamin D intake was 360 +/- 141 (SD) IU/day in the control group and 2170 +/- 144 (SD) IU/day in the experimental group. Median 6-week serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 24 ng/ml (range 3 to 60 ng/ml) in the control group and 68 ng/ml (range 9 to 150 ng/ml) in the experimental group (p less than 0.001). Overall, 20% of the infants had evidence of moderate radiographic bone disease and only 2% were severely affected. The radiographic bone score (median = 2.5) and serum osteocalcin concentration (mean = 21.7 +/- 8.7 ng/ml) in the control subjects did not differ significantly from those in the experimental group (median bone score = 2.0; mean osteocalcin level = 24.1 +/- 7.9 ng/ml). Although there may be a subset of very low birth weight infants who would benefit from high doses of vitamin D, we conclude that no generalized clinical improvement can be attributed to this regimen alone.\r"

  ".W": "Because 10% and 20% intravenously administered lipid emulsions (intralipid preparations) differ in their phospholipid/triglyceride ratio (0.12 and 0.06, respectively), 28 low birth weight infants requiring parenteral nutrition for at least 1 week were selected at random to receive either emulsion to determine the effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Triglyceride intake was progressively increased to reach 2 gm/kg per day between days 4 and 7. During that period, all plasma lipids in samples taken 6 hours after infusion were higher in the 10% intralipid group. In comparison with day 0 values, triglyceride concentrations decreased (63 +/- 7 to 45 +/- 4 mg/dl; p less than 0.05) in the 20% group. Cholesterol levels increased in both groups, but the rise was more than twofold higher in the 10% group. Phospholipid increase was approximately 25% in the 20% group but more than 125% in patients receiving the 10% emulsion (p less than 0.005). The changes in plasma cholesterol and phospholipid levels were almost entirely in low-density lipoproteins. After 7 days, eight infants from each group were given the alternate emulsion, which resulted in a reversal of lipid patterns in each patient. We conclude that the higher phospholipid intake in 10% than in 20% intralipid is associated with higher plasma triglyceride concentrations and leads to accumulation of cholesterol and phospholipids in low-density lipoproteins. Emulsions with lower phospholipid content may be preferable for low birth weight infants and perhaps other patient populations with impaired removal of parenteral fat emulsions.\r"

The sample consisted of 985 inborn preterm low birth weight infants enrolled at eight participating sites in a randomized clinical trial using uniform sampling criteria. When gestational age was used as the reference standard, striking differences were found by ethnicity and site in the prevalence of low weight infants at birth. These differences, as well as the potentially false overlap of classification, were attenuated when the use of gestational age as a reference standard was used only for birth length, while length itself was used (as an alternative to gestational age) as the reference standard for birth weight, and weight was used as the reference standard for head circumference. These results raise questions about the use of gestational age as the primary or only reference standard in assessing weight and head circumference at bith.\r"

  ".W": "The multiple actions of nicotine enantiomers at the peripheral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were evaluated using electrophysiological and biochemical techniques. The alpha-bungarotoxin binding site showed a 6-fold greater affinity for (-)-nicotine than for the (+)-isomer, and this stereoselectivity was reflected in differences in the ability of the alkaloids to activate physiological responses in the forms of single ion channel currents, endplate depolarizations and muscle contractures. (-)-Nicotine was also more potent to induce slow desensitization. In contrast, both (-)- and (+)-nicotine were equipotent as ion channel blockers. Ion channel blockade occurred at effective agonist concentrations for (+)-nicotine but above the effective concentration for (-)-nicotine. The rapid and reversible interaction of nicotine enantiomers with the ion channel occurred at concentrations which implicate a significant contribution of channel blockade to the inhibition of indirect muscle twitch. The agonistic and ion channel blocking effects of the nicotine enantiomers provide important clues regarding the mechanisms by which nicotine may affect central nervous system nicotinic receptors.\r"

Morphine treatment resulted in a decrease in the maximal excitation produced by both mu and delta selective agonists, [N-MePhe3,D-Pro4]-morphiceptin and [D-Pen2,L-Pen5]-enkephalin. The opioid antagonist naloxone did not produce apparent signs of withdrawal in hippocampal slices from morphine-treated rats as shown by a lack of change in the evoked population spike in the presence of 500 nM naloxone. Brain slices from morphine-treated rats that were maintained in the absence of morphine showed signs of tolerance reversal when monitored over an 8-hr period after dissection. If morphine-tolerant slices were maintained in vitro in the presence of 5 microM morphine (the concentration found by high-performance liquid chromatography to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid of morphine-treated rats), there was no significant reversal of tolerance. Furchgott analysis of the [N-MePhe3,D-Pro4]-morphiceptin concentration-response curve shifts induced by the irreversible opioid receptor antagonist beta-chlornaltrexamine revealed an apparent 50% spare receptor reserve for the mu selective agonist in slices from drug-naive rats. beta-Chlornaltrexamine (20 nM) treatment and chronic morphine exposure resulted in a similar reduction in the maximal response to [N-MePhe3,D-Pro4]morphiceptin. This observation indicates that the development of morphine tolerance resulted in an elimination of the spare opioid receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of nicotine to induce antinociception after subcortical administration was investigated in the rat. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with guide cannulas aimed at the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of the mesopontine tegmentum. After 1 week, nicotine was injected in 0.5 microliter of 0.2 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. Antinociception was assessed using the 52 degrees C hot-plate test and the tail-flick method; for the most part, the results in the hot-plate test parallelled those in the tail-flick test. Nicotine inhibited nociceptive responses at a median effective antinociceptive dose (A5O) of 1.6 nmol in the hot-plate test and 3.4 nmol in the tail-flick test. Mecamylamine, 0.8 nmol coadministered with nicotine, antagonized nicotine antinociception as evidenced by 5- to 8-fold increases in the nicotine A5O. Nicotine antinociception was also antagonized by coadministrations of either 0.8 nmol of (-)-scopolamine or 0.4 nmol of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine by over 12-fold in the hot-plate test and 5-fold in the tail-flick test. The M2 antagonist methoctramine had antinociceptive effects of its own when injected into the mesopontine tegmentum at a dose of 0.1 nmol; when coinjected with nicotine, the effects of the methoctramine-nicotine combination appeared to be additive. One hour preinjection into the mesopontine tegmentum with 13.5 nmol of (-)-vesamicol, an agent which interferes with acetylcholine storage and/or release, markedly inhibited nicotine antinociception; only a 24% antinociceptive response could be elicited by nicotine in the hot-plate test whereas the nicotine A5O was increased 3-fold in the tail-flick test. Pretreatment with the inactive isomer (+)-vesamicol had no effect. In other experiments, mesopontine tegmental injection of (+)-cis-dioxolane, a high affinity muscarinic cholinergic agonist, elicited strong antinociceptive responses which were potently antagonized by coadministration with 0.5 nmol of pirenzepine but not by 0.8 nmol of mecamylamine. The data indicate that nicotine-induced antinociception may depend upon intact neurotransmission at M1 sites in addition to nicotinic sites within the mesopontine tegmentum.\r"

The study involved administration of naloxone to rats at doses of 5, 20 and 40 mg.kg-1.hr by either the intravenous or enteral routes. Blood samples were collected throughout the period of restraint and gastric stress-lesions were counted at the end of the experiments. Both routes of administration were equally effective in preventing stress-ulceration, with only rats receiving drug intravenously showing the presence of naloxone in blood samples. Inverse linear relationships existed between mean trough blood concentrations and lesions (P = .0003), as well as a linear correlation between area under the time-concentration curve and mean trough concentrations (P = .0001). Although our results show tight correlation between blood levels and effect on lesions in the group given drug intravenously, the effect must be on peripheral rather than central opiate receptors as no detectable blood levels were found when naloxone was given enterally.\r"

In this study, the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of S-(6-purinyl)-L-cysteine, the potential precursor of the antitumor and immunosuppressant drug, 6-mercaptopurine, was examined. With renal subcellular fractions, 6-mercaptopurine was identified as a metabolite of S-(6-purinyl)-L-cysteine by its electronic absorption spectrum and by high-performance liquid chromatography. The rate of enzymatic 6-mercaptopurine formation was dependent upon incubation time, substrate and protein concentrations. Aminooxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of renal beta-lyase, inhibited the reaction. The total renal beta-lyase activity with S-(6-purinyl)-L-cysteine as substrate was distributed equally between the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and constituted nearly 54% of the activity measured with the prototype substrate, S-(2-benzothiazolyl)-L-cysteine. The apparent Vmax value for the mitochondrial beta-lyase-dependent metabolism of S-(6-purinyl)-L-cysteine to yield 6-mercaptopurine was 4-fold greater than the rate measured with cytosol, whereas the rates of metabolism of S-(2-benzothiazolyl)-L-cysteine by the cytosolic and mitochondrial beta-lyase were similar. When rats were given S-(6-purinyl)-L-cysteine (31.2 mg/kg i.p.) and were sacrificed at 30 min after treatments, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-methyl-mercaptopurine and 6-thiouric acid were detected in the kidney, liver or plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Apparent pA2 analysis was used to determine whether the short-duration opioid agonist, alfentanil, acts at mu receptors in the positive reinforcement of operant behavior in the rhesus monkey. In test sessions a red light signaled the availability of alfentanil injections. If a monkey pressed a response lever 30 times, a specific dose of alfentanil was injected i.v., and the red light was extinguished for 10 min. This cycle could be repeated for up to 130 min, the maximum length of a session. Between successive test sessions at least three maintenance sessions were held; in these sessions injections of 0.32 mg/kg/injection of codeine were made available. The dose of alfentanil was changed from one test session to the next, and dose-dependent changes in rates of responding resulted. Rates reached 3.05 responses/sec at 0.010 mg/kg/injection, the highest dose tested. The opioid antagonist, quadazocine, produced dose-dependent, parallel shifts to the right in the alfentanil dose-response curve. In Schild Plot analysis the regression line fit to the antagonism data had a slope of -1.1; the apparent pA2 value for quadazocine was 7.6. This value was close to apparent pA2 values obtained with mu agonists in studies of other behavioral effects of opioids, but distinct from values obtained with kappa agonists in those studies. Thus, it is likely that mu receptors mediate the positive reinforcing effect of alfentanil.\r"

Analgesic studies in mice examining increasing doses of NalBzoH with a fixed dose of morphine revealed a biphasic curve. NalBzoH at doses as low as 1 microgram/kg partially antagonized morphine analgesia. Higher NalBzoH doses continued to inhibit morphine analgesia in a dose-dependent manner, with the 1-mg/kg dose antagonizing completely morphine analgesia. As the NalBzoH dose increased beyond 1 mg/kg analgesia returned. NalBzoH also prduced a similar analgesic response when administered alone in mice and also was active in rats. NalBzoH had excellent p.o. activity, with an analgesic potency in mice equivalent to s.c. administration. Naloxone reversed NalBzoH analgesia far less effectively than morphine analgesia. In contrast, Win44,441 antagonized both morphine and NalBzoH analgesia with a similar potency, consistent with a kappa mechanism for NalBzoH analgesia. Repeated administration of NalBzoH resulted in tolerance. There was no analgesic cross-tolerance between NalBzoH and either morphine or the kappa 1-selective agent U50,488H, implying a selective kappa 3 mechanism of analgesia. In addition to blocking morphine analgesia, low doses of NalBzoH also partially reversed the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit in mice produced by morphine, antagonized completely morphine lethality and precipitated withdrawal in morphine-dependent mice, confirming its antagonist activity in mu receptors. The duration of NalBzoH's kappa and mu actions differed dramatically. In mice, analgesia typically lasted less than 2 hr whereas the same NalBzoH dose antagonized completely morphine analgesia, a mu action, for 16 hr. Full sensitivity to morphine did not return for 32 hr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Morphine-6 beta-glucuronide is a major metabolite of morphine with potent analgesic actions. To define more fully the importance of this compound in morphine action, we have compared the analgesic actions of morphine and its 6 beta-glucuronide metabolite after both peripheral and central administration. Given s.c., morphine-6 beta-glucuronide elicited analgesia with an effect approximately twice that of morphine due, in part, to its long duration of action and also inhibited gastrointestinal motility. Both actions were easily reversed by naloxone (s.c.). However, when injected either i.c.v. or intrathecally, morphine-6 beta-glucuronide was approximately 90- and 650-fold more potent an analgesic than morphine, respectively. Whereas morphine in these studies was equipotent at both levels of the neuraxis as an analgesic, the 6 beta-glucuronide was approximately 5-fold more effective at the level of the spinal cord than supraspinally. The mu 1-selective antagonist naloxonazine blocked the analgesic effect of systemic and i.c.v. morphine-6 beta-glucuronide much as it blocked morphine, implying a role for mu1 receptors in these actions. Like morphine, morphine-6 beta-glucuronide analgesia after intrathecal injection was not sensitive to naloxonazine, suggesting a mu2 mechanism within the spinal cord. Together, these results imply that morphine-6 beta-glucuronide elicited its analgesic actions through the same receptor mechanisms as morphine. Mice highly tolerant to morphine after implantation of morphine pellets showed cross-tolerance to morphine-6 beta-glucuronide (s.c.). The high potency of morphine-6 beta-glucuronide strongly suggests that this metabolite plays an important role in morphine's actions.\r"

Changes in short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (G1) and unidirectional and net Na+ and Cl fluxes measured in the absence or presence of SK&F 104353 (1 microM) revealed that serosal addition produced a decrease in net Na+ absorption and serosal-to-mucosal Cl- flux. Serosal addition of leukotriene (LT)D4 (10 muM) or LTE4 (10 microM) elicited transient increases in Isc and sustained decreases in G1 which were antagonized by serosal addition of SK&F 104353 in a concentration-dependent manner. Mucosal addition of SK&F 104353 (1 microM) also reduced the increase in Isc elicited by LTD4 (10 microM). LTD4 (10 microM) decreased unidirectional and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes along with G1 in the steady state. All of these changes were abolished by pretreatment with SK&F 104353 (1 microM). The intestinal secretagogues prostaglandin F2 alpha, histamine, serotonin, substance P and the thromboxane mimic, U46619, produced changes in Isc qualitatively similar to those of LTD4. However, the transient increase in Isc produced by these secretagogues was not antagonized by SK&F 104353 (1 microM). Additionally, lysbradykinin- and prostaglandin E1-induced increases in Isc were not antagonized by SK&F 104353 (1 microM). Stimulation with histamine (10 microM) or pretreatment with LTB4 (5 microM) did not alter the increase in Isc or decrease in Gt produced by the subsequent addition of LTD4 (10 microM). Pretreatment of the tissues with mepyramine (10 microM) also did not reduce the increase in Isc elicited by LTD4 (10 microM), although it inhibited completely the increase in Isc produced by histamine (10 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two types of experimental paradigms were used, the first of which separated the toxin binding step from subsequent events in paralysis and the second of which did not. In both paradigms the toxin produced concentration-dependent blockade of transmission. However, the results with low concentrations were variable, and in some cases complete neuromuscular blockade did not develop. The isolated acidic and basic subunits possessed little toxicity. In experiments designed to characterize binding, the intact toxin displayed the following properties: 1) the apparent half-time for tissue association was about 22 min; 2) binding was not affected by low temperature, the presence or absence of nerve stimulation and the substitution of strontium for calcium; and 3) when binding was allowed to go to completion, reversibility was negligible. Pretreatment of tissues with the isolated subunits of crotoxin did not enhance or inhibit the binding of the parent molecule. Modification of one histidine residue in the isolated basic subunit, followed by reconstitution with unmodified acidic subunit, generated a molecule that possessed only about 10% of the neurotoxicity of the native toxin. The modified toxin could not be used to antagonize binding of the native toxin. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated that neutralized the biologic activity of crotoxin. In experiments that separated the binding step from later events in paralysis, the polyclonal preparation continued to locate and partially neutralize tissue-bound toxin. In experiments that initiated events that follow binding, polyclonal antibodies were progressively less effective with time in neutralizing toxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The possible interaction between activation of prejunctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and the release-inhibiting opioid receptors as well as the effect of changes in Ca++ entry into adrenergic varicosities during repetitive stimulation were investigated by recording vasoconstriction of the rabbit ear artery perfused in vitro. Neither the activation of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated negative feedback by clonidine nor its inhibition by yohimbine altered the neuroinhibitory potency for dynorphin 1-13 or Met-enkephalin at any stimulus train length. Experimental conditions known to increase the entry of calcium into the varicosities mimicked the effect of the increase in the stimulation train length on the modulation of norepinephrine release by opioids. Increasing the extracellular calcium concentration (from 1.6-5 or 8 mM) diminished the inhibitory effect of opioids and tended to abolish the dependence on stimulation train length. Conversely, lowering the calcium concentration (from 1.6-1 mM) increased the inhibition by opioids and enhanced the dependence on train length. These results do not suggest a direct interaction between activation of opioid receptors and alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Rather, they indicate the role of opioid receptor activation in a primary modulation of Ca++ influx which becomes masked by the high levels of axoplasmic calcium which are achieved during a continued stimulation train.\r"

Studies were carried out in male Wistar rats to determine if the mechanism is inhibition of intestinal bile acid absorption or cholesterol esterification. Bay o 2752 did not alter intestinal bile acid absorption as measured by in vitro uptake of [14C]taurocholic acid into ileal everted sacs (0.01 and 1.0 mg/ml of Bay o 2752) or the biliary excretion of radioactivity after in vivo ileal perfusion of the bile acid and drug (1.0 mg/ml at 1.0 ml/min for 1 hr). Cholesterol esterification was determined by measurement of in vitro activity of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase from hepatic microsomes and cholesterol ester hydrolase from pancreatic supernatant, and the in vivo lymphatic output of cholesteryl ester after intraduodenal cholesteryl infusion. Addition of Bay o 2752 (0.01-10 micrograms/ml) to hepatic microsomes produced a concentration-dependent decrease in acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity with an IC50 of 0.95 micrograms/ml. Cholesterol ester hydrolase activity was unaffected by the drug (1.0-100 micrograms/ml). Intraduodenal infusion of Bay o 2752 (10 mg/ml at 0.9 ml/hr for 8 hr) reduced markedly the flux of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into the mesenteric lymph, especially the lymphatic output of the esterified form of both radioisotopically labeled and total cholesterol. These data suggest that Bay o 2752-induced reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption results from its potent inhibitory effect on acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase activity.\r"

Chronic exposure to excessive amounts of opioid antagonists results in a doubling of the number of binding sites. However, the direct electrophysiological significance of this increased number of opioid receptors in the central nervous system remains uncharacterized. We examined the effects of an opioid peptide with high affinity and high specificity for mu receptors, DAMGO (D-ala2-mePhe4-gly-ol5 enkephalin), under normal conditions and after 1 or 2 weeks of continuous infusion of the opiate antagonist naltrexone. Chronic infusion of naltrexone administered to the whole animal resulted in significant up-regulation (71%) of mu opioid receptors in the rat hippocampus. Slices of the hippocampus were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid while recording population spikes in stratum pyramidale, excitatory postsynaptic potentials in stratum radiatum and while stimulating afferents in the Schaffer collaterals. Superfusion of slices with DAMGO produced a concentration-dependent increase in the amplitude of population spikes. No significant change was observed in the simultaneously recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential slope. This selective increase in population spike amplitude led to a leftward shift (19%) in the derived input-output curve. In addition, DAMGO superfusion produced extra spiking at higher stimulus intensities. Naltrexone reversed the DAMGO-induced increase in excitability, as well as prevented additional spikes. DAMGO superfusion of slices taken from chronically treated rats produced a much greater shift (42%) in the input-output curve than it did in untreated controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of aging on muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in the brain were investigated in Fischer-344 rats. Oxotremorine-M stimulated this response to the same magnitude in young and old rats in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and cerebellum, although maximal stimulation varied among brain regions within each age group. The PI response was also equally potentiated by elevated K+ or suppressed by tetrodotoxin in both age groups. In addition, a phorbol ester attenuated muscarinic receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis in the cerebral cortex to the same extent in young and aged rats. Moreover, preincubation with oxotremorine-M resulted in a similar down-regulation of cell-surface receptors and desensitization of receptor function regardless of age. Therefore, under our experimental conditions, PI hydrolysis in response to activation of brain muscarinic receptors does not appear to be sensitive to aging-related alterations.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that the increase in gastric mucosal blood flow during pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion in the rat is mediated partly by endogenously generated adenosine. In in vivo microscopic studies, topical 10(-5) to 10(-3) M adenosine dose-dependently dilated the submucosal arterioles, the vessels that control mucosal blood flow. The adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline, significantly reduced adenosine's vasodilatory response. An adenosine analog with a high A2 receptor affinity was 100 times more potent as a vasodilator than one with a high A1 receptor affinity but lower A2 receptor affinity. We then examined the effect of i.v. 8-phenyltheophylline, 10 mg/kg, on the pentagastrin-stimulated increase in gastric blood flow and gastric acid secretion. Mucosal blood flow was estimated by the hydrogen clearance technique. Pentagastrin increased mucosal blood flow from 26.6 +/- 2.6 to 42.7 +/- 4.9 ml/min/100 g and this was reduced to 31.9 +/- 3.1 ml/min/100 g upon the addition of 8-phenyltheophylline. Gastric acid secretion upon the addition of 8-phenyltheophylline. Gastric acid secretion was stimulated by pentagastrin and stimulated further by the addition of 8-phenyltheophylline from 2.06 +/- 0.34 mEq of H+ per min to 2.84 +/- 0.49 mEq/min. 8-Phenyltheophylline had no effect on basal mucosal blood flow or gastric acid secretion. In contrast, the nonmethylxanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724 stimulated acid secretion and increased gastric mucosal blood flow during pentagastrin administration. The data suggest that gastric submucosal arterioles contain adenosine receptors of the A2 subtype that vasodilate when activated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The former effect is caused by blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors whereas the latter effect has been shown to occur in the medulla, specifically at the intermediate area on the ventral surface of the medulla. The receptor mediating the central effect is not the alpha-1 adrenoceptor, but has been postulated to be the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor. To determine whether urapidil lowers blood pressure by stimulating 5-HT1A receptors at the intermediate area, we applied urapidil bilaterally (50 micrograms/side) to the intermediate area of chloralose-anesthetized cats while monitoring arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Application of urapidil caused decreases in mean blood pressure and heart rate of 66 +/- 8 mm Hg and 31 +/- 7 beats/min, respectively. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, spiperone (30 micrograms/side), counteracted the effects of urapidil. Pretreatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, did not alter the hypotensive effect of urapidil. Urapidil given i.v. in a dose of 2 mg/kg decreased mean blood pressure and heart rate by 53 +/- 6 mm Hg and 10 +/- 2 beats/min, respectively. At the peak of the i.v. response, spiperone (30 micrograms/side) was applied to the intermediate area and increased mean blood pressure and heart rate by 52 +/- 6 mm Hg and 20 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively, thus effectively reversing the effects of i.v. urapidil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was performed in conscious animals 3 to 5 days after a 2-hr occlusion/reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Dogs in which PES resulted in a reproducible nonsustaining or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were randomized to receive i.v. celiprolol (3 mg/kg, n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10). PES and measurement of electrophysiologic (parameters were repeated after 30 min and the animals were entered into the sudden death protocol by introducing a 150-microA anodal current to the lumen of the left circumflex coronary artery via a surgically implanted silver wire electrode. Celiprolol failed to prevent the induction of VT, and the outcome of the sudden death protocol did not differ from vehicle with respect to either sudden (within 1 hr of ischemia) or delayed (greater than 1 hr) mortality. VT cycle length and ventricular refractoriness were prolonged (P less than .05) by celiprolol, but other electrophysiologic parameters were unaffected. Heart rate was not altered after drug, but celiprolol antagonized the ischemia-induced increase in rate seen in the vehicle group. Similar electrophysiologic results and mortality data were apparent in a third group of dogs which received pindolol (0.09 mg/kg, n = 8). The failure of both drugs to protect against ischemic ventricular fibrillation in a model in which beta adrenoceptor antagonism has previously proved beneficial may be due in part to related cardiostimulant properties shared by celiprolol and pindolol.\r"

In contrast, there was no significant correlation (P greater than .5) among the potencies of the drugs to depress bladder contractile responses (in vitro and in vivo in the cystometrogram) and their potencies as antispasmodic or local anesthetic agents. Based on these correlations, we suggest that the anticholinergic component of the drugs' action is important in current effective therapies of bladder dysfunction. However, the possibility that other ancillary activities may also contribute to the specific mechanism of action of these agents in the urinary bladder is not ruled out.\r"

These antibodies were used to develop a radioimmunoassay ranging from 0.2 to 15.0 ng/ml of physostigmine in a 0.1-ml plasma sample. A typical standard curve gave an r2 value of 0.992. This assay measures physostigmine in plasma with better sensitivity and much greater through-put than do current state-of-the-art, high-performance liquid chromatography techniques.

This study examined the effects of continuous systemic infusion of physostigmine using osmotic minipumps. One week of continuous physostigmine infusion in normal animals inhibited cortical AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner. Doses causing near maximal (0.06 mg/kg/hr) and ED50 (0.0075 mg/kg/hr) inhibition of cortical AChE activity were used to determine the effects of continuous physostigmine administration on spatial learning in the water maze in rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the NBM. Physostigmine had no effect on the acquisition of the maze task but prevented the retention deficit measured in untreated NBM-lesioned rats. Physostigmine treatment also improved the search strategy during the spatial probe trial compared to the untreated NBM-lesioned rats. The two doses of physostigmine examined did not produce differential responses on behavioral measures. Although NBM lesions significantly depleted cortical AChE activity, physostigmine treatment reduced the activity further in a dose-dependent manner. Whereas neither the lesion nor the low dose of physostigmine altered cortical receptor binding, the higher dose of physostigmine significantly down-regulated cortical muscarinic receptor binding by 28%. These data demonstrate that enhancement of acetylcholine neurotransmission can improve memory loss and spatial strategy associated with excitotoxic NBM lesions.\r"

An analogous contractile derangement occurs in the posthypoxic heart in vitro. This study determined the role of neutrophils in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiac dysfunction in the isolated buffer-perfused rabbit heart utilizing a recirculating system with or without neutrophils present. In control hearts perfused with a neutrophil-free buffer, reoxygenation after 20 min of hypoxia was associated with a slow recovery of contractility which returned to prehypoxic values by 30 to 45 min. Although perfusion with buffer-containing neutrophils did not affect the hypoxia-induced decrease in myocardial contractility, the recovery of contractile function during subsequent reoxygenation was significantly diminished (P less than .01 vs. control), remaining depressed by 30 to 35% at 45 min. The myocardial neutrophil content increased approximately 2-fold in response to hypoxia and reoxygenation, as assessed using 51Cr-labeled neutrophils. The deleterious effects of neutrophil perfusion on cardiac function could not be attributed to neutrophil-mediated plugging of coronary vessels or enhanced myocellular damage. These results support the concept that neutrophils contribute to the cardiac dysfunction described in this model.\r"

Infusion of 12-o-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) at 5 x 10(-7) mM produced renal vasoconstriction and a rise in basal perfusion pressure without any consistent effect on the rise in tritium efflux or the perfusion pressure elicited by RNS. Higher concentrations of TPA (5 x 10(-6) to 5 x 10(-5) mM) increased both the basal as well as RNS-induced efflux of tritium; the basal perfusion pressure was increased so dramatically that the effect of RNS to raise perfusion pressure was reduced compared to that observed in the vehicle group. Infusion of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate at 6 x 10(-6) mM reduced the basal but increased the RNS-induced efflux of tritium; the basal as well as the rise in perfusion pressure caused by RNS was increased. Phorbol-13-monoacetate that does not activate PKC failed to alter the basal or the increase in tritium efflux and perfusion pressure elicited by RNS. The rise in perfusion pressure produced by TPA or phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate was reduced by nifedipine (1.4 x 10(-6) mM) but it was abolished by omission of Ca++ from the perfusion medium.

The human platelet and the HT29 human colonic adenocarcinoma cell contain alpha-2A adrenergic receptors, whereas the neonatal rat lung and the NG108 neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell contain the alpha-2B adrenergic receptor. Using the attenuation of the cyclic AMP accumulation as a functional assay, the affinities of various antagonists for the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor were determined in HT29 and NG108 cell lines. Dose-response curves to 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazoline-2-yl-amino)quinoxaline (UK 14,304) an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, were generated in the absence and presence of three concentrations of various antagonists. Schild regressions were used to determine pA2 values and then dissociation constants (KB value) were calculated. Whereas phentolamine and yohimbine were equipotent at the receptor in the two cell lines, 2-(2,4-(O-methoxyphenyl)-piper-azin-1-yl)ethyl-4,4-dimethyl-1,3-(2 H,4H)- isoquinolindione (ARC-239) and prazosin were 100- and 30-fold more potent in the NG108 cell line than in the HT29 cell. These potency ratios determined from functional experiments are the same as those obtained from radioligand binding experiments. These functional data are consistent with the previous and more extensive binding data, and thus support the existence and definition of alpha-2A and alpha-2B adrenergic receptor subtypes.\r"

Amiodarone, 5 microM did not significantly alter the time course of ICa decay, but did shift the steady-state inactivation curve for lca in the hyperpolarizing direction by 9.2 +/- 3.1 mV. Development of block at depolarized potentials was voltage-dependent between -20 and 10 mV with time constants of 112 +/- 33 and 755 +/- 212 msec at 10 mV. In the presence of 0.2 microM amiodarone, recovery from inactivation was fitted by a double exponential most likely indicating rapid recovery of the drug-free Ca++ channels and slow recovery of the drug-associated Ca++ channels with time constants of 44 +/- 12 and 108 +/- 403 msec, respectively, at -80 mV. The proportion of the current recovering via the slow phase was 36 +/- 7%. By using this value, we estimated the dissociation constant in the inactivated state to be 0.36 microM. Amiodarone's marked use-dependent block of lca is explicable in terms of its high affinity for, and slow dissociation from, Ca++ channels in the inactivated state. These results suggest that amiodarone blocks lca in both the resting and inactivated states.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When measured by the competitive inhibition of the binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-[3H]methylscopolamine, the binding properties of selective muscarinic antagonists in the corpus stratum and cerebral cortex were consistent with a model incorporating a minimum of three populations of muscarinic receptors, a high affinity site for pirenzepine (M1), a high affinity site for AF-DX 116 [11] [2-[ (diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl] -5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b] 1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one (M2) and a third population (non-Ml, non-M2 sites) displaying low affinity for the latter antagonists. The results of similar experiments on the heart showed that this tissue contained a uniform population of M2 muscarinic receptors. The binding properties of the M2 receptor in cerebral cortex and corpus stratum were also investigated directly in antagonist [3H] AF-DX 116 competition experiments and, although the high affinity AF-DX 116 site in brain (M2) exhibited selectivity for the cardioselective antagonists AF-DX 116 and gallamine, some differences were noted between M2 sites in brain and heart. The muscarinic adenylate cyclase response in the corpus striatum was relatively insensitive to the M2 selective antagonists AF-DX 116 and gallamine as well as the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine, suggesting that non-M1, non-M2 sites inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in the corpus striatum. In contrast, the effects of muscarinic antagonists on the muscarinic adenylate cyclase response in the heart were consistent with the postulate that M2 receptors inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in this tissue.\r"

At concentrations of 0.65 to 2 microM Bay K 8644 caused significant increases in end-plate potential amplitude and mean quantal content in cut muscle preparations, but no effect in uncut preparations in which contractions were blocked by using d-tubocurarine (1 microM). The dose-dependence of this effect occurred over a very narrow concentration range. This increase in quantal content, which occurred within 5 to 10 min of application of Bay K 8644, could be blocked by pretreatment or reversed by subsequent treatment of the preparation with nimodipine, a DHP antagonist. Nimodipine itself had no effect on quantal content. At concentrations of Bay K 8644 in excess of 1 microM, increase quantal content was usually followed by a subsequent complete failure of nerve-evoked release of transmitter. Administration of Bay K 8644 was also associated with an increase in the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs). This effect was observed in 5 of 6 \"cut\" and only 1 of 6 \"uncut\" preparations. Increase of MEPP frequency occurred after a latent period of 15 to 25 min of treatment with Bay K 8644, and was not prevented pretreatment with nimodipine. Nimodipine itself had no effect on MEPP frequency. Increased MEPP frequency occurred in cut preparations treated with Bay K 8644, but with solutions to which no extracellular Ca++ was added.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One approach, as reported in the literature, may be to determine the clearance rates of the antipyrine metabolites, which are formed by different isoenzymes of cytochrome P-450. Pharmacokinetics of antipyrine were determined in 3-, 12-, 24-, 30- and 36-month-old male BN/BiRij rats. The elimination T1/2 did not change with age, or were changes found in apparent volume of distribution. The systemic clearance of 24-month-old rats, when expressed as milliliters per minute-1 was higher than that of 3- and 12-month-old ones. When expressed as milliliters per minute-1 per kilogram-1, the systemic clearance decreased between 3 and 12 months. Thereafter, no change occurred. The partial clearance, expressed as milliliters per minute-1, did not change with age. Expressed as milliliters per minute-1 per kilogram-1, the partial clearance of the metabolites also did not change for hydroxymethylantipyrine (HMA) and 4-hydroxyantipyrine (4-OHA) but for norantipyrine (NORA) a decrease was found between 3 and 24 months, followed by a tendency to increase between 24 and 36 months.

However, acetylcholine (ACh) release from the striatum (1 Hz, 2 min), was only enhanced slightly by PDBu. The increase in DA release induced by PDBu was reduced markedly at higher frequencies of stimulation. Sulpiride (10 microM) alone, a D2 DA-receptor antagonist, or combined with nomifensine (3 microM), a neuronal-uptake inhibitor, did not prevent PDBu-induced facilitation of DA release from prefrontal cortex or striatum. The D2 DA agonists (LY-171555, bromocriptine and apomorphine) inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the stimulation-evoked overflow of DA and ACh from the striatum, and of DA from the prefrontal cortex. Pretreatment with PDBu antagonized the inhibitory effect of the three agonists on DA and ACh release. A reduction both in Emax and IC50 was observed in PDBu-treated slices. Removal of endogenous DA by pretreatment with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, failed to prevent PDBu-induced antagonism of apomorphine effects on ACh release, indicating that the antagonism of agonist effects was not due to higher synaptic levels of endogenous DA. The inactive enantiomer of PDBu, 4-alpha-12,13-dibutyrate did not enhance DA release and failed to modify the effects of D2 agonists on DA release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Whereas water deprivation induced an increment in urine osmolality both in control and vehicle-treated animals, this response was blocked by benzylimidazole and acetaminophen in the 5-day-old rats. No effect was observed in the older rats. Benzylimidazole also increased sodium excretion in the newborn rat. To assess the effect of benzylimidazole on epithelial cells deprived of the influence of hemodynamic factors, sodium transport and water flow were studied in the frog skin and in the toad bladder, respectively. In the frog skin epithelium, benzylimidazole (10(-4) M) inhibited the vasopressin-stimulated (100 mU/ml) sodium transport and in the toad bladder it decreased the vasopressin-stimulated (5 mU/ml) hydroosmotic flow. Our results suggest that thromboxanes are necessary for a full development of the response to vasopressin in sensitive epithelia.

  ".W": "The disappearance of high-energy phosphates (HEPs) in the rat brain during global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest is slowed down significantly by dihydropyridine Ca antagonists (DCAs) compared to controls. Two mechanisms might account for this effect: increased HEP production via anaerobic glycolysis or decreased HEP consumption. In order to obtain more insight into the underlying mechanisms of ATP preservation we have studied in the rat the effect of the DCAs isradipine, darodipine and nimodipine on the cerebral steady-state levels of HEPs and lactate as well as the intracellular pH value during global ischemia using combined 31P/1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We have found that the ATP preservation in DCA-treated animals is not associated with significantly higher postischemic lactate levels (lactate/N-acetylaspartate 0.97 +/- 0.08 for isradipine at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg i.p.) or lower pH values (6.40 +/- 0.03) as compared to control rats (lactate/N-acetylaspartate 0.94 +/- 0.13, pH = 6.49 +/- 0.03). This is in contrast to hyperglycemic rats, in which similar preservation of ATP levels during ischemia was observed; however, at the expense of a larger drop in brain pH (6.22 +/- 0.09) and a concomitant increase in cerebral lactate (lactate/N-acetylaspartate = 1.40 +/- 0.09). These results strongly favor reduced ATP consumption to be the cause for the protective effect of DCAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the fasting state, EM-523 given i.v. or i.d. at 3 micrograms/kg or more induced contractions in the stomach that migrated along the small intestine. The pattern of the contractions was very similar to that induced by motilin. In the digestive state, EM-523 increased the amplitude of gastric contractions. Cisapride and metoclopramide increased gastrointestinal motility both in the fasting and digestive states; however, their contractile pattern was different from that of EM-523. Trimebutine did not induce gastric motility in the fasting state but rather decreased gastric motility in the digestive state. The contractions induced by EM-523 and motilin were inhibited by atropine but were not affected by naloxone, suggesting that the cholinergic pathway is important in the exertion of their action. These results indicate that EM-523 mimics motilin in stimulating gastrointestinal motility and that this agent may be useful treat gastrointestinal disorders such as gastric stasis, gastroesophageal reflux, and postoperative ileus, and so forth.\r"

The antagonism caused by this new analog was compared to that obtained with the substance P analog [D-Arg1,D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9,Leu11]Substance P [( APTTL]SP), which has been used until now to characterize bombesin receptors on smooth muscle cells. psi 13,14-BN resulted to be more potent than [APTTL]SP as antagonist of bombesin action on smooth muscle. Comparing the IC50, psi 13,14-BN (IC50 70 nM) was 8 times more potent than [APTTL]SP (IC50 600 nM). In contrast to [APTTL] SP, the action of psi 13,14-BN was shown to be specific toward bombesin receptors in that it does not interfere with receptors for other agents (i.e., cholecystokinin, acetylcholine or substance P). The antagonism induced by both compounds was competitive inasmuch as the slope of the regression lines obtained by Schild plot analysis were not significantly different from the unity. The apparent affinity for the bombesin receptor was 0.8 nM for psi 13,14-BN and 7.8 nM for [APTTL]SP. These results indicate that psi 13,14-BN acts on isolated gastric smooth muscle cells as a competitive bombesin receptor antagonist, with a higher affinity and specificity than the substance P analog used previously.\r"

The ligand selectivity profile observed in this study suggests that [125I] hCGRP binding sites present in rat brain and spleen are similar. The high affinity of the analogs [Cys(ACM)2.7]hCGRP and cyclo2.7 [Asp2, Lys7]hCGRP indicates that the disulfide bridge between positions 2 and 7 is not essential for the binding of the ligand to the CGRP receptor. On the other hand, the lack of affinity of various N-terminal fragments in the binding assays demonstrates the importance of amino acids 9-37 in maintaining appropriate receptor recognition. The existence of CGRP receptor subtypes is supported by data obtained in various in vitro bioassays. For example, the linear analog, [Cys(ACM)2.7]hCGRP, which retained high potency in the rat vas deferens bioassay displayed no agonistic activity in the right and left guinea pig atrial preparations. Additionally, the C-terminal fragment hCGRP 12-37 possessed some antagonist properties in atrial but not vas deferens preparations. Thus, it appears that it is possible to differentiate between CGRP receptor subtypes on the basis of differential agonistic (e.g.[Cys(ACM)2.7]hCGRP) and antagonistic (e.g., hCGRP 12-37) potencies in various isolated tissues. Moreover, the weak but significant antagonistic properties of hCGRP 12-37 may be most useful in order to design more potent CGRP receptor antagonists.\r"

Self-administration interacted with weight loss and indicated that: 1) a minimum level of 15 to 25% weight loss was required to obtain cocaine self-administration; 2) weight loss-induced potentiation of cocaine self-administration resulted from an interaction of increased nonspecific lever pressing activity and increased reinforcing effects of the compound; and 3) optimal differentiation between cocaine- and saline-induced responding was obtained at 15 to 25% weight loss. Daily pretreatment during the five test sessions, with 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg of naltrexone or 43 to 375 micrograms/kg of haloperidol, dose-dependently decreased the number of cocaine (0.12 mg/ml) self-injections. Naltrexone pretreatment, and to a lesser extent haloperidol pretreatment, appeared to affect cocaine self-administration in a specific manner; both treatments affected responding on the reinforced lever, but not responding on the nonreinforced lever. Self-administration of 0.06 mg/ml of cocaine tended to be decreased by naltrexone (1 mg/kg) and haloperidol (375 micrograms/kg); whereas self-administration induced by 0.25 mg/ml of cocaine was not significantly affected by naltrexone or haloperidol.

Delivery rate appeared to be an important factor in the effect of 4% w/v of STDHF on DGAVP bioavailability; on infusion a mean DGAVP bioavailability (+/- S.D.) of 47 +/- 12% was obtained, whereas after bolus delivery it amounted to 27 +/- 6%. For both compounds the effect of STDHF was significant at 0.5% w/v. It is concluded that STDHF is capable of actively enhancing the rectal absorption of poorly absorbed drugs, including small peptides.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine specific reagent, on H+ coupled transport of cephradine via dipeptide carriers in the intestinal brush-border membranes, in comparison with the effects of other chemical modifiers. Pretreatment of membrane vesicles with DEPC resulted in the inhibition of cephradine transport in the presence or absence of an inward H+ gradient. This inhibition was reversed by subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine, but not with dithiothreitol. The inactivation by DEPC pretreatment was abolished by the presence of cephradine or glycylsarcosine. In the DEPC-pretreated membranes, the V(max) value of cephradine uptake was decreased without any change in the Km value. In contrast, cephradine uptake was not changed by the pretreatment with N-acetylimidazole, a tyrosine specific reagent, or p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, a sulfhydryl reagent. These results suggest that histidine residues in the carriers are essential for H+ coupled transport of amiocephalosporins.\r"

  ".U": "90040242\r", 
  ".W": "The renal handling of salicyluric acid (SU) was studied over a broad concentration range (0-400 micrograms/ml) in the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK). The accumulation of SU was determined by difference calculations between the SU dose given and the SU amount present in the perfusate and excreted into the urine. SU accumulates highly in the IPK and this accumulation is concentration-dependent. At low perfusate concentrations (5-20 micrograms/ml) there is a sharp increase in the accumulation (100-400 micrograms/g), whereas at higher concentrations (20-100 micrograms/ml) a small increase (400-500 micrograms/g) is seen. The largest part of the accumulation is probably caused by accumulation of SU in the tubular cells. This is a result of the active uptake of SU over the basolateral membrane followed by facilitated diffusion over the brush-border membrane. As a result of the saturation of the active SU uptake, accumulation reaches a maximal value. Excretion of SU in the IPK involves glomerular filtration, active secretion and reabsorption. Reabsorption is probably a passive process, dependent on the urinary flow and pH. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant of the excretion is 18.7 +/- 1.8 micrograms/ml and the maximum transport capacity is 69.8 +/- 1.4 micrograms/min. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the excretion of SU were in good agreement with previously reported in vivo values.\r"

  ".W": "The modes in which quinidine blocks the delayed K+ current (IK) of rabbit sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes were investigated by voltage clamp experiments using small preparations. Depolarizing pulses were applied from a holding potential of -50 mV and resultant IK current was evaluated. At a concentration of 2 x 10(-6) M, quinidine blocked 52 +/- 5% of IK with a 1000-msec test pulse of 0 mV, whereas it inhibited the slow inward current by only 5 to 10%. IK inhibition was enhanced with increasingly larger depolarizations. The activation curve obtained with the use of 1000-msec test pulses shifted toward hyperpolarization by 3.0 mV and its slope factor increased from 7.3 to 8.8, suggesting a voltage-dependent mechanism for IK blockage. Short and small depolarizing pulses from the holding potential of -50 mV hardly affected II. The activation of IK in the presence of quinidine did not show any delay. These results indicated a low affinity of quinidine to the closed (deactivated) channels. The deactivation time constant of IK was significantly prolonged from 120 to 145 msec at -50 mV. By applying the modulated receptor model to the K+ current, the tail current in the presence of quinidine was well reconstructed when the time constant of drug-channel interactions was 300 msec at -50 mV and 2000 msec at -30 mV. It is suggested that the unblocking of quinidine slows the decay of the IK tail current.\r"

  ".U": "90040244\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the usefulness of calmodulin antagonists in intact cell systems, effects of three calmodulin antagonists, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), chlorpromazine (CPZ) and calmidazolium on isometric tension development and myosin light chain (P-LC) phosphorylation in bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were compared to inhibition of purified myosin light chain kinase activity. These antagonists inhibited the Ca++-calmodulin-induced activation of myosin light chain kinase in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 1.0 (calmidazolium), 25 (W-7) and 65 microM (CPZ), respectively. Inhibitory effects of these antagonists were abolished with increasing concentrations of calmodulin. However, when these antagonists were used in intact smooth muscle strips, the gradation of potencies did not parallel the anticalmodulin activities. W-7 (100 microM) exhibited a similar extent of antagonism between the contractile responses to carbachol and KCl. The increase in P-LC phosphate content in response to 1-min stimulation with 10(-5) M carbachol was inhibited by W-7. CPZ exhibited an unexpectedly potent antagonism on carbachol-induced isometric tension development and P-LC phosphorylation. Atropine showed an antagonism similar to CPZ. CPZ and verapamil had similar antagonistic effects on KCI-induced contractions. Calmidazolium (50 microM) produced no significant inhibition on carbachol-induced isometric tension development and P-LC phosphorylation in intact smooth muscle strips. It may be concluded that 1) W-7 antagonizes the smooth muscle contraction through the inhibition of the initial increase in the P-LC phosphorylation; 2) CPZ produces effects other than calmodulin antagonism; and 3) calmidazolium is not effective in intact smooth muscle strips.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concentration-dependent effects were assessed by exposing embryos from fertilization through the late gastrula/prism stage and scoring abnormal development via light microscopy. Malformations were observed as early as the first cleavage, when asymmetric, incomplete and arrested cleavage were noted, and also at the prism stage. These effects were concentration-dependent with an EC50 value of approximately 40 microM at both the cleavage and prism stages. Several phenytoin analogs of varying toxicity were identified. Comparison of zygote uptake of phenytoin and one nonteratogenic analog found that toxicity was not limited by uptake as the analog achieved intracellular concentrations which would have been sufficient to induce abnormal development if it had an intracellular potency equal to that of phenytoin. Periods in sea urchin embryogenesis susceptible to phenytoin actions were identified by exposing embryos to phenytoin (120 microM) for discrete intervals after fertilization and scoring development at the prism stage. A critical period of unique susceptibility coincided with the cleavage and morula stages (0- approximately 64 cells/embryo, 0-5 hr after fertilization). Drug exposure after this period did not alter development. Studies examining phases of the cell cycle for susceptibility to phenytoin effects on cleavage found that drug exposure confined to M phase was necessary and sufficient to manifest developmental toxicity. Drug uptake was similar during the sensitive and insensitive developmental stages and cell cycle phases and thus was not responsible for the variations in susceptibility observed. We conclude that the direct effects of phenytoin on sea urchin embryogenesis are confined to the cleavage and morula stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the cytologic follow-up all the patients revealed borderline lesions (mild to moderate dysplasia) of the epithelium with koilocytosis. Since DNA aneuploidy is widely accepted as a marker for malignancy, an attempt was made to obtain a DNA diagnosis of prospective malignancy in these cases on the basis of the detection of single aneuploid cells. Because koilocytosis strongly suggests human papillomavirus infection, euploid polyploidy might result in up to 8c (c = haploid amount of DNA). Therefore, the aneuploidy detection threshold was set to 9c, excluding values around 16c and 32c (+/- 12.5%) to avoid false-positive diagnoses in cases of higher polyploidy values. The DNA diagnosis of malignancy was made in 13 patients. In 12 of them, carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in the histologic follow-up, resulting in 100% sensitivity of the DNA diagnosis. In five patients no cells greater than 9c were measured, leading to a benign DNA diagnosis. In the histologic follow-up, six patients revealed normal epithelium or moderate dysplasia. Thus, the specificity of the DNA diagnosis was 83.3%.\r"

In conjunction with a localized reversal of the T4:T8 ratio of T-lymphocytes, that finding provides evidence of the association of epithelial immunosuppression with both HPV infection and CIN. To investigate whether that phenomenon occurs primarily because of HPV alone or might be caused by a cofactor (e.g., cigarette smoking, oral contraceptive use, chlamydial infection), we performed a study of the effect of those cofactors on the immune defenses of the cervical epithelium. In a study of Langerhans' cells we showed that infection with HPV type 16 and current cigarette smoking both exert effects that cause a reduction in those cells. That diminution of the major antigen-presenting cells in cervical epithelium may constitute a mechanism that explains the observed role of those agents in the etiology of cervical neoplasia.\r"

Two hundred two women (18.8%) had abnormal cervical or vaginal biopsies, 74 had human papillomavirus, and 128 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with or without associated papillomavirus infection. Invasive cancer was not detected. Repeat cytology suggested intraepithelial neoplasia in 60 women, 37 (61%) of whom had positive biopsy findings. Such biopsy findings were obtained in 89 of 306 women (29.1%) with repeat squamous atypia on cytology and in 76 of 708 women (10.8%) with repeat negative cytology. When the data were stratified in terms of age, 184/787 (19.6%) abnormal biopsies occurred in women less than or equal to 40 years of age and 18/287 (6.3%) in women greater than or equal to 41.

We compared MC to cone histology in evaluating the endocervix in women with inadequate colposcopy or positive endocervical curettage (ECC). Thirty-one patients were studied. All had standard colposcopic examinations that were deemed inadequate or resulted in positive ECC. MC was then performed and followed by cervical conization. Histologic specimens were obtained from serial sections of the surgical specimen. All 31 patients had adequate MC examinations. MC had a positive predictive value of 87% in evaluation of the endocervix as compared to cone histology specimens. Sensitivity and specificity were 99% and 70%, respectively. MC had a sensitivity of 92% in identifying the cervical segment with the worst histologic diagnosis. MC can evaluate the endocervix in patients with inadequate colposcopy or positive ECC. Biopsy of the worst histologic region in those patients can be guided by MC examination; thus, conization of the cervix can be avoided.\r"

This study compared the sampling accuracy of the modified Ayre spatula/Zelsmyr cytobrush versus the modified Ayre spatula/cotton swab in the detection of cervical lesions with koilocytotic features. The histologic categories consisted of koilocytotic lesions (flat condylomas) with minimal cellular atypia and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, II and III with surface koilocytes showing cellular atypia (atypical koilocytosis). Using the spatula/cytobrush there was 88% concurrence (118/134 cases) between the cytologic/histologic diagnosis of flat condyloma and CIN with atypical koilocytosis. Using the spatula/swab there was a cytologic/histologic concurrence of 68% (71/104 cases). Statistical analysis confirmed the difference between the two techniques to be significant. In addition, a higher percentage of CIN II and III lesions with koilocytotic features was detected with the spatula/cytobrush--54% (19/35 cases) as compared to 30% (14/46 cases) for the spatula/swab. The results of this study support the use of the spatula/cytobrush in the detection of cervical lesions with koilocytotic features.\r"

Recent molecular biologic studies strongly suggested that HPV acts at least as a cocarcinogen in the female genital organs. Thus, a study of the presence of HPV DNA in adenocarcinoma in situ, endocervical glandular dysplasia and microglandular endocervical hyperplasia, three lesions suggested as possible precursor lesions of adenocarcinoma of the cervix, would clarify some aspects of the histogenesis of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The presence of HPV-6, HPV-16 and HPV-18 in those precursor lesions was studied with highly sensitive in situ DNA hybridization. Fourteen of 21 cases of adenocarcinoma in situ (67%) contained HPV DNA; approximately the same proportion of HPV DNA was seen in invasive adenocarcinoma. Two of 36 cases of endocervical glandular dysplasia contained HPV DNA; both of them were lesions coexisting with adenocarcinoma in situ and thus might have been well-differentiated lesions of adenocarcinoma in situ. HPV DNA was not present in 16 cases of microglandular endocervical hyperplasia. Adenocarcinoma in situ may be the earliest event in HPV infection of the endocervical cells to lead to the development of adenocarcinoma of the cervix.\r"

Radiolabeled proteins of variable molecular weight (14-150 kDa) and charge (isoelectric point (pI) 4.5-10) were administered by intravenous and intraarticular routes, and localization studies in the first 2 and at 24 h were done with autoradiography. Small cationic proteins rapidly penetrated joint tissues after intravenous injection and persisted in larger amounts compared to anionic proteins of corresponding size. Small cationic proteins easily penetrated the matrices of both epiphysial and articular cartilage. In contrast larger cationic proteins (cBSA, cIgG) persisted for the greater part in the tissues just around the vessels and cartilage association was less striking. After intraarticular injection it was found that low molecular weight proteins (14 to 47 kDa) are rapidly cleared from the joint. Small cationic proteins persisted somewhat better than anionic ones, but impressive retention was only found with cationic proteins with higher molecular weight (67 to 150 kDa). Our data help to define prerequisite properties of proteins for penetration and interaction with joint structures after systemic supply or local production.\r"

The mean proliferative response to the collagen was somewhat greater (p less than 0.05) with SF, compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, the magnitude of this response was relatively weak as determined by stimulation indices, and it did not approach that observed with peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to tetanus toxoid. Sixty-seven percent of peripheral bloods and 50% of SF demonstrated positive responses to the control antigen, tetanus toxoid. In contrast, only 6 and 28%, respectively, were positive in response to type II collagen. The addition of exogenous interleukin 2 augmented responses to the tetanus toxoid, however, no such enhancement with type II collagen was noted in our patients. Our collagen was arthritogenic in experimental animals. These observations do not support the existence of T cell specificity toward type II collagen as a common mechanism for the expansion of synovial lymphocytes in RA.\r"

The percentage of the total CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in all patients with active SLE. Of interest, however, all the patients with active SLE and central nervous system (CNS) disease had a selective decrease in the percentage of CD4+ 2H4+ T cell subsets in circulating blood that is responsible for induction of the CD8+ suppressor T cells. This loss of the CD4+ 2H4+ T cells was accompanied by an increase in the CD4+ 4B4+ T cell subsets, that are the true helper/inducers providing help for B cell immunoglobulin production. A marked decrease in the CD4+ 2H4+ cell subsets in the circulating blood of all patients with severe active SLE and CNS disease is related with meaningful functional properties of the T cells in an abnormal immune system.\r"

The more active the disease, the greater the decrease in erythrocyte CR1. The level of erythrocyte CR1 was inversely correlated with the level of circulating immune complexes (CIC) and was positively correlated with C3, CH50, factor B, and factor H. We also found lupus nephritis more frequently in patients with decreased erythrocyte CR1 than in those with normal levels of erythrocyte CR1. Our results suggest that the deficiency of erythrocyte CR1 in patients with SLE is acquired and may serve as a variable of clinical disease activity and may play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE.\r"

Antibody levels were assessed by isotype-specific ELISA and compared with 15 pediatric disease controls and 36 healthy adult controls. These determinations revealed significant differences in the pattern of IgG and IgM autoantibody expression in adult and pediatric patients. IgM aCL were more common in the pediatric than adult SLE population with 11 of 32 pediatric patients being positive compared to only 4 of 36 in the adult group (p less than 0.05). Conversely, enhanced IgG autoantibody production was observed in the adult group as 27 of 36 adult patients were positive for IgG anti-DNA compared to only 16 of 32 children (p less than 0.05). Analysis of sequential sera showed differences in the temporal expression of IgG and IgM autoantibodies as well as variability between anti-DNA and aCL responses over time.

In both groups of children, decreasing concentrations of proteoglycans were seen during growth. Changes were most marked at the age of 12-13. The serum levels were higher in the healthy children. Our results suggest an age related metabolic change of articular cartilage, resulting in diminished release of proteoglycans to SF and blood with growing age up to 20 years.

  ".W": "Increased intraarticular hydrostatic pressure (Pia) may inhibit juxtaarticular muscle function, obstruct blood supply to joint structures and promote anoxic joint destruction in chronic arthritis. Joint capsular stiffness together with synovial fluid volume determines Pia at rest. Seventeen knee joints with effusive arthritis and different degrees of radiological cartilage involvement in 13 patients with chronic arthritis were examined. Since capsular elastance was difficult to standardize, we introduce a measure of joint capsular stiffness where the intraarticular volume yielding a pressure of 50 mm Hg (V50) is used. After normalization of injected volumes according to the V50, pressure volume curves became similar. Intraarticular hydrostatic pressure and maximal voluntary isometric extensor torque were measured simultaneously, while altering the intraarticular fluid volume in 9 knee joints. In 5 of these, quantified electromyography (EMG) of the vastus medialis and lateralis portion of the quadriceps muscle was also monitored. Progressive inhibition of extensor torque and EMG was found as the intraarticular pressure volume was increased in both intact and destroyed joints. No difference in inhibition was found for the 2 portions of quadriceps muscle tested. Increased intraarticular hydrostatic pressure Pia levels between 200 and 1150 mm Hg were observed during maximal voluntary activation of extensor muscles. The reproducibility was good for all variables studied. In a few instances evidence of intraarticular compartmentalization was found at low volumes. We conclude that the V50 is a convenient expression of capsular stiffness. Furthermore, increasing Pia caused by joint effusion inhibits knee extensor muscle function and impairs synovial blood flow. Awareness of these relations will facilitate more rational therapeutic approaches in chronic arthritis.\r"

After one year of corticosteroid treatment he experienced increasing pain in both legs and fluctuating serum creatinine kinase levels. Direct measurement showed elevated resting intracompartment pressure and both static strain and dynamic exercise provoked the typical pain. At operation all 4 compartments of both legs were decompressed and he recovered uneventfully. The compartment syndrome may be a hitherto unknown, but expected complication of severe EF.\r"

Further, splenectomized mice were found to be susceptible to collagen induced arthritis with a similar disease incidence to sham operated controls.

Patients had significantly increased amounts of IgA RF and all complexes when compared to controls (p less than 0.0005). IgA-IgG complexes, thought to be IgG-IgA RF complexes, were inversely correlated to tissue pathology (p less than 0.001) and peripheral white blood cell counts.

Data obtained by recall of events during the 12 months before disease onset in cases, and an identical time period in sex matched sibling controls, suggest that important questions for further study include the roles of antecedent heavy muscular exertion and emotional stress as risk factors for PM-DM. Furthermore, it appears that vaccinations, toxic exposures and symptoms of allergic phenomena, throat infection, and upper respiratory infection are either neutral or are negatively associated with risk of PM-DM, findings which also raise important new etiologic questions, or perhaps lay old ones to rest.

We studied the protection afforded by synovial fluid (SF) against an important reactive oxygen species intermediate, hydrogen peroxide, quantitating SF-H2O2 scavenger levels and testing their functional capacity. Mean H2O2 scavenger levels in noninflammatory SF were low -3.9 mumol H2O2/ml-and similar to those found in plasma. Higher levels were found in inflammatory SF (24.6 mumol H2O2/ml), but still far below those found in whole blood (1,145.2 mumol H2O2/ml). SF with higher scavenger levels protected lymphocytes from H2O2 mediated damage and reversed lymphocyte suppression mediated by activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes. SF-H2O2 scavengers could be augmented by addition of certain blood cell subtypes, known enzymatic and chemical scavengers and also by several slow acting antirheumatic drugs. Our results indicate that the adaptive response of inflamed SF to reactive oxygen species is suboptimal. However it also appears that SF antioxidant levels could be augmented by certain slow acting antirheumatic drugs if sufficient tissue levels were obtained.\r"

After controlling for age, we found a modestly increased rate of radiographic OA in those with chondrocalcinosis (relative risk = 1.52 (95% CI 1.22, 1.90). There was a similar link between chondrocalcinosis and severe radiographic OA (relative risk = 1.52). Chondrocalcinosis was positively associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic radiographic OA. The proportion of radiographic OA potentially attributable to chondrocalcinosis was only 4.4%.

Results from our study suggest that cimetidine may provide an effective prophylactic therapy against both NSAID related symptoms and gastroduodenal mucosal lesions.\r"

All patients had markedly elevated proportions of OKM1 positive mononuclear cells and some of the healthy consanguineous relatives also exhibited the same abnormality. Proliferative responses of lymphocytes to phytomitogens were generally normal.

Nineteen infusions of radiolabeled TIL were given to 18 patients, while five patients received radiolabeled autologous PBL during TIL therapy. Clear tumor localization was seen on 13 of 18 nuclear scan series performed on 111In-TIL recipients, while tumor was imaged in only one of four scan sequences on patients given 111In-PBL. Nineteen paired biopsies of tumor and normal skin were completed on 10 patients receiving 111In-TIL, while eight biopsies were done on three PBL patients receiving 111In-PBL. The mean percentage of total injectate activity localizing per gram of tumor tissue was 0.0049% in the TIL group and 0.0010% in the PBL group (P2 = .0004). The mean of the tumor to normal skin ratios of the 111In-TIL group was three times that for 111In-PBL (P2 = .0072). One patient was studied by nuclear scanning on three consecutive treatment courses of CPM, TIL, and IL-2. He initially demonstrated clear tumor localization by 111In-TIL at several sites, then faint localization with 111In-PBL at a single site, and subsequently positive tumor imaging on repeat 111In-TIL infusion at multiple sites. These results confirm and expand our initial data demonstrating that human TIL transferred with CPM pretreatment and followed by IL-2 preferentially localize to tumor sites and indicate that this localization is greater for TIL than PBL.\r"

The relative risk (RR) of cancer was elevated for men with a history of homosexual activity (RR = 12.4, P less than .001). However, after adjustment for other risk factors, this risk was reduced to 2.7 (P = .28). Risk was elevated for homosexual male patients who reported a history of genital warts (RR = 12.6, P = .03), anal fissure or fistula (RR = 9.1, P = .05), and cigarette smoking (RR = 1.9 for 20 pack-yr, P less than .001; RR = 5.2 for 50 pack-yr, P less than .001). (Pack-year is a unit of cigarette use equal to 365 packs.) There was also elevated risk for heterosexual male and female patients who reported a history of genital warts (RR = 4.4, P = .003), anal fissure or fistula (RR = 2.4, P = .03), and more than 12 episodes of hemorrhoids (RR = 2.6, P less than .001). These findings suggest that anal cancer risk is etiologically related to human papillomaviruses that cause genital warts. In addition, constant irritation, chronic inflammatory changes, and repeated epithelial regeneration that accompany noninfectious conditions may be related to risk of anal cancer. The higher risk among homosexual men is related to the higher prevalence of anal cancer risk factors for this group.\r"

The resistant cells contained reduced levels of topoisomerase activity and messenger RNA. The topoisomerase gene of these cells was rearranged (only in one allele) and hypermethylated. These topoisomerase gene alterations probably resulted in reduced transcription and, thus, enzyme production, which was correlated with resistance to the topoisomerase inhibitor.\r"

  ".W": "Recent clinical reviews have helped to clarify the role of Emergency Department (E.D.) thoracotomy in critically injured adults. However, guidelines in the pediatric population remain ill defined. The purpose of this report is to examine the yield of E.D. thoracotomy in patients less than or equal to 18 years of age to allow for a more cost-effective application of this heroic measure. From an 11-year experience of 689 consecutive E.D. thoracotomies, 83 patients (12%) were less than or equal to 18 years old. Mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in 57%, gunshot wound in 30%, and stab wound in 13%. Mean age was 15 years and 71% were male. Survival by injury mechanism was 9% (1/11) for stab wound, 4% (1/25) for gunshot wound, and 2% (1/47) for blunt trauma. Sixty-nine patients presented to the E.D. without vital signs and only one, a 16-year-old with stab wounds to the chest and abdomen, survived. In contrast, two (14%) among 14 patients presenting with vital signs were salvaged. As in adults, outcome was largely determined by injury mechanism and physiologic status on E.D. presentation. Blunt trauma, the predominant mechanism of lethal injuries in children, had a dismal outcome, with only 2% salvage and no survivors when vital signs were absent. This study demonstrates a similar outcome for E.D. thoracotomy in children compared to adults, and supports a selective policy of liberal use in penetrating injury irrespective of physiologic status but limited in those arriving lifeless following blunt trauma.\r"

The most common physical findings were tachypnea (13 patients) and subcutaneous emphysema (nine patients). Eight patients presented with airway obstruction. All patients with penetrating cervical tracheal injuries underwent neck exploration and primary repair. All blunt injuries were diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Three patients with blunt injuries were treated with primary repair. Two patients with blunt chest trauma and small bronchial tears were treated nonoperatively with good results. All three deaths (14% mortality rate) were due to associated injuries. We conclude that patients with penetrating tracheobronchial injuries should be managed by surgical exploration and primary repair, although selected patients with blunt injury may be treated nonoperatively.\r"

Twenty-two patients (0.2%) suffered 14 blunt and eight penetrating lower extremity orthoarterial injuries. In all, more than 90 extremity operations were performed within 30 days of admission. The mechanism of injury, ISS, sequence of orthopedic and vascular procedures, use of temporary arterial shunts, the nature of the arterial reconstruction, length of ischemic time, and the presence of open fractures did not affect limb salvage or outcome. The presence of neurosensory/motor impairment and/or serious soft-tissue loss and injuries at or distal to the popliteal artery were associated with a high frequency of disability and amputation. Tremendous effort was expended to achieve limb salvage in the patients of this review. Patients who underwent amputation had the more uneventful hospitalizations and the lower rates of disability. The notion that limb salvage need to be obtained in all patients at all costs may often lead to the triumph of technique and technology over reason.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 98 patients with transpelvic gunshot wounds from 1983 to 1988 were reviewed: 22 patients were admitted in shock and required aggressive resuscitation and immediate exploration, and 76 patients were normotensive and were evaluated with diagnostic peritoneal lavage, angiography, cystography, proctoscopy, CT scan, and contrast-enhanced CT enema in various combinations as indicated. Using this approach, 40 stable patients were observed without operation and discharged without complications. Fifty-eight patients were explored: 20 had both arterial and hollow viscus injuries. Thirty-nine major vascular injuries were evaluated: 27 were ligated and 12 repaired. Other injuries were colon, 27; including seven rectal perforations, multiple small bowel perforations, five bladder, one ovarian, four ureteral, three caval, three renal, and two distal aortic injuries. Colon injuries associated with vascular injuries were treated with colostomy and ligation of the vessel with extra-anatomic bypass when revascularization was required. Overall 12 patients died as a result of their injuries, a mortality of 12.2%. However, 50% of the patients who were admitted in shock died. Two external iliac artery injuries and two ureteral injuries were missed at initial operation. Penetrating trauma to the pelvis presents a serious challenge because of the complex anatomy of the region. Patients in shock have a high incidence of vascular injury and subsequent exsanguination, and associated visceral injuries may complicate their management. However, stable patients may be managed without operation, when appropriate diagnostic techniques fail to demonstrate an injury. Arterial ligation and extra-anatomic bypass should be considered for vascular injury with gross fecal contamination.\r"

We compared the effects of naloxone alone versus incomplete volume resuscitation on survival and splanchnic blood flow. Dogs were bled to a MAP of 35 mm Hg for 2 hours. In eight dogs, shed blood was returned; eight dogs received naloxone (2 mg/kg bolus and 2 mg/kg/hr in 0.5 ml/kg/hr normal saline) with no shed blood returned. Seven dogs received normal saline alone without shed blood or naloxone and served as untreated controls. Untreated dogs survived a mean of 18.6 minutes. All other dogs survived for 180 minutes. Naloxone and shed blood were equally effective in improving hepatic and renal blood flow; gastric, intestinal, pancreatic, and splenic blood flow remained unchanged from shock values in both groups. These data indicate that in the face of hypovolemia naloxone improves survival and blood flow (ml/min/gm) to splanchnic organs despite no return of shed blood.\r"

We prospectively studied prophylactic amikacin and clindamycin in 150 abdominal trauma patients requiring laparotomy, analyzing the effects of duration of coverage, dosing interval, and dose. No difference in infection rates was noted when 72-hour coverage was compared with 24-hour coverage (19% vs. 21%). Clindamycin dosed at 1,200 mg every 12 hours achieved acceptable serum concentrations; infection rates were not significantly higher than seen with 600 mg every 6 hours (21% vs. 12%, p greater than 0.05). High-dose (11 mg/kg) amikacin reduced infection rates in patients with high blood loss (p less than 0.025), high Injury Severity Scores (p less than 0.025), and no colon penetration (p less than 0.005). These data suggest that high doses are more effective than long courses of antibiotics in reducing infections in trauma patients undergoing laparotomy.\r"

This study reviews the incidence of fatal sepsis in our burn center and attempts to analyze factors which may predict septic mortality. From January 1, 1978, through May 31, 1988, 1,913 patients were admitted, with a mean age of 24.8 +/- 0.5 years, a mean burn size of 17.7 +/- 0.4% total body surface area (%TBSA), and a mean 10.1 +/- 0.5% TBSA full-thickness injury. Nine per cent of patients sustained concurrent inhalation injuries. Overall mortality was 7.4%, and 1.6% of patients died from sepsis. Regression analysis showed that overall burn size, presence of inhalation injury, and the extent of full-thickness burn injury were significant independent predictors of death from sepsis, in decreasing order of relative importance. During the period 1983-1988, the incidence of septic mortality was 0.7%, which was significantly lower than the earlier half (1978-1982) of the study period (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that fatal infections are becoming increasingly uncommon after thermal injury. The reasons for this decline are probably multiple, and they include the widespread practice of early excision, and improvements in fluid resuscitation and the general medical care of burned patients.\r"

  ".W": "Tube thoracostomy (TT) is required in the treatment of many blunt and penetrating injuries of the chest. In addition to complications from the injuries, TT may contribute to morbidity by introducing microorganisms into the pleural space or by incomplete lung expansion and evacuation of pleural blood. We have attempted to assess the impact of TT following penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma by examining a consecutive series of 216 patients seen at two urban trauma centers with such injuries who required TT over a 30-month period. Ninety-four patients suffered blunt chest trauma; 122 patients were victims of penetrating wounds. Patients with blunt injuries had longer ventilator requirements (12.6 +/- 14 days vs. 3.7 +/- 7.1 days, p = 0.003), longer intensive care stays (12.2 +/- 12.5 days vs. 4.1 +/- 7.5 days, p = 0.001), and longer periods of TT, (6.5 +/- 4.9 days vs. 5.2 +/- 4.5 days, p = 0.018). Empyema occurred in six patients (3%). Residual hemothorax was found in 39 patients (18%), seven of whom required decortication. Recurrent pneumothorax developed in 51 patients (24%) and ten required repeat TT. Complications occurred in 78 patients (36%). Patients with blunt trauma experienced more complications (44%) than those with penetrating wounds (30%) (p = 0.04). However, only seven of 13 patients developing empyema or requiring decortication had blunt trauma. Despite longer requirements for mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and intubation, victims of blunt trauma seemed to have effective drainage of their pleural space by TT without increased risk of infectious complications.\r"

  ".W": "Of 210 patients with major intra-abdominal vascular injuries, 111 (53%) survived more than 48 hours. Of these, 41 (37%) developed serious infections resulting in death or a hospital stay exceeding 14 days (mean, 55 +/- 49) in the 33 who survived. The most frequent serious infections were intraperitoneal and resulted in a 35% mortality rate (8/23). The 111 patients surviving 48+ hours were divided into two groups based on their initial E.D. BP and injuries. The \"high-risk\" patients (with no obtainable blood pressure on admission, five or more injuries or a colon injury with a systolic BP of 40 to 89 mm Hg) had a serious infection rate of 63% (25/40). This was significantly higher than the serious infection rate of 23% (16/71) in the remaining 71 \"low-risk\" patients (p less than 0.001). The patients were then evaluated for factors which surgeons might control. In the high-risk group, resuscitation adequate to produce an initial operating room (O.R.) systolic BP greater than 70 mm Hg and early control of bleeding so that less than 10 units of blood were used resulted in a serious infection rate of only 20% (2/10) versus 77% (23/30) in the other high-risk patients (p less than 0.01). In the low-risk patients, having an initial O.R. systolic BP greater than 70 mm Hg and using less than 10 units of blood resulted in a serious infection rate of 13% (6/48) versus 43% (10/23) in the others (p less than 0.05). High-risk patients failing to meet these resuscitation goals must be watched particularly carefully for development of infections.\r"

A retrospective review of blunt trauma patients at the Washington Hospital Center Trauma Unit and data from the Major Trauma Outcome Study identified a two- to fivefold increase in the incidence of aortic injury among patients with pelvic fracture. Twenty to forty-five per cent of patients with aortic rupture had associated pelvic fracture. Our study documents that pelvic fracture is as reliable an indicator of associated aortic rupture as many currently accepted injuries. Its presence should raise suspicion for aortic injury.\r"

With rapid deceleration, however, parenchymal lacerations can result in cavities best termed post-traumatic pulmonary pseudocyst (PPP). This report discusses eight adult PPP cases encountered at the Denver General Hospital over the past 30 months. Five were males and the mean age was 29 years (range, 18 to 54). Injury mechanism was motor vehicle accident in four, industrial machinery in two, autopedestrian accident in one, and large-animal rodeo rollover in another. Review of daily portable anteroposterior chest roentgenograms revealed parenchymal infiltrates consistent with pulmonary contusion that typically cavitated within the first week. Computed tomography of the chest was pursued in complicated patients and clearly influenced therapy. Three (38%) pseudocysts developed into lung abscesses; two required resection and the other responded to percutaneous drainage. Although previously described as a benign pediatric entity, in our adult experience, PPP may result in a recalcitrant lung abscess requiring aggressive intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The immunologic value of the spleen is now unchallenged; recognition of this fact has changed the management of splenic trauma radically over the past decade. This review describes our clinical experience in adults during this metamorphosis. In the 10-year period ending December 1987, 314 adults had splenic injury identified at emergent laparotomy. Mean patient age was 30.1 years and 81% were men. Injury mechanism was blunt in 227 (72%), stab wound in 49, and gunshot wound in 38. In 1978 splenorrhaphy was accomplished in nine (29%) of 31 patients; during 1982-1987 the rate of operative splenic salvage has been 63% (107/170). Splenorrhaphy was achieved with hemostatic agents in 40%, debridement and suturing in 40%, formal splenic resection in 13%, and mesh bag in 7%. Grade I splenic injuries were amendable to hemostatic agents alone, and suturing or mesh enclosure was necessary in 43% of Grade II and in all Grade III injuries. Grade IV disruption required anatomic splenic resection for hemorrhage control in 88% of the cases. During this period 63 patients underwent splenectomy; 48 (76%) had Grade V injuries that were technically unapproachable. The remaining splenectomies were performed expeditiously in multisystem injured patients harboring other critical injuries. This decade perspective documents the feasibility of operative splenic salvage in nearly two thirds of acutely injured adults. Conversely, more than one third require prompt splenectomy due to massive splenic disruption or the presence of concomitant life-threatening injuries.\r"

  ".U": "90040852\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed the hospital records and autopsy data of all deaths occurring at a Level I Trauma Center during a 1-year interval to determine the epidemiology of traumatic death in a regionalized system of care: 1,581 patients were admitted and 106 died (6.6%). Nonsurvivors (NS) differed significantly from survivors (S) in age, Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and probability of survival, but there was no difference between NS and S in scene time or transport time. Of the NS 91.4% died within 7 days; only 8.6% died after 7 days. Central nervous system (CNS) injury was responsible for 48.1% of deaths, followed by hemorrhage (36.8%) and cardiovascular disease (5.7%). Sepsis was responsible for 5.5% of deaths. Secondary brain injury was found at autopsy in 66% of patients dying of CNS injury. The relatively small number of septic deaths may be due, in part, to improvements in treatment associated with regionalization of trauma care. The frequency of secondary brain injury, despite rapid transport and evacuation of mass lesions, suggests that it may play a major role in the pathophysiology of CNS death occurring in a trauma system.\r"

When the significance of all injuries and major complications was evaluated using simultaneous ANOVA techniques, only brain and chest trauma together were significant (p less than 0.03) as injuries occurring in subsequently fatal cases for all classes of blunt hepatic injury. Sepsis (p less than 0.05) and ARDS (p less than 0.005) were significant complications associated with death in the patients who survived the initial operative intervention, and only brain deterioration and exsanguinating hemorrhage were significant (p less than 0.0001) as direct causes of death in all groups of patients. It was of interest that neither associated bowel, spleen, stomach, or pancreatic injuries had a significant difference in incidence between survivors and deaths. Overall, the most important single injury determining ultimate outcome was blunt traumatic injury of the brain. Review of the resuscitation and operative intervention strategies, postoperative complications, and causes of death shows that the interactions between the class of liver injury and the injuries to other organs, primarily brain and lung, are the determinant of the optimization of postinjury therapy of both a surgical and critical care nature.\r"

The PT, aPTT, thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FI), factors V (FV) and VIII (FVIII), fibrin(ogen) split products (FSP) and fibrin monomers were measured in OR and after OR at 6 and 15 hours, days 2 and 4, and at convalescence (25 days). The TT, PT, and aPTT were were prolonged in OR and reflected the low FI, FV, and FVIII, respectively. After OR, clotting times and factor levels returned toward normal. By day 4 and convalescence, FI, FV, and FVIII exceeded normal levels. FSP levels were normal in OR. After OR FSP rose progressively through day 4 when all patients had levels greater than 10 mcg/ml and most patients had levels above 40 mcg/ml. Fibrin monomers were absent until the 15-hour study after which a small number of patients had monomers through the convalescent study. The acute fall in clotting factors is likely due to increased hemostatic demands, plasma dilution from resuscitation, and extravascular relocation from shock-induced extravascular expansion. Later factor restoration likely reflects enhanced hepatic synthesis, factor half-life, capillary selectivity retaining large molecular weight factors, and intravascular relocation from abundant extravascular stores. Throughout this biphasic response, the clotting times reflect factor levels. Fibrinolysis contributes little to these changes.\r"

Beta blocking and low doses of ganglionic blocking agents failed to control cardiovascular instability even when combined. High doses of ganglionic blockers stabilized hemodynamics for a short period, but caused the elevation of transaminases. After unsuccessful treatment with cardiovascular drugs, continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) was applied to five patients. For 5 to 23 days circulation was regulated artificially under complete blockade of the autonomic nervous system by infusing isotonic 0.5% bupivacaine intrathecally. Catecholamine was added intravenously to maintain adequate blood pressure. Before the introduction of CSA, three patients died of circulatory failure. In contrast, CSA dramatically suppressed the cardiovascular instabilities, and all five treated patients survived. This suggests that both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems need to be blocked to stabilize hemodynamics in severe tetanus.\r"

Trauma surgeons most often encounter shock secondary to hypovolemia or cardiac tamponade, and the effectiveness of CCCPR in that setting has not been established. To determine the hemodynamic effects of external massage in profound shock, hypotension was induced in baboons. Pressures obtained with external massage were compared to spontaneous intra-arterial pressures before compression. Although external massage increased systolic pressures in both tamponade and hypovolemia, diastolic pressures were consistently decreased. We conclude that CCCPR does not augment arterial pressure in the clinical situations associated with decreased LVEDV and is unlikely to provide organ perfusion for trauma victims.\r"

In addition, image analysis was used to study the potential risk of this combination for exacerbating intramedullary hemorrhage in the injured spinal cord. SCBF, mSAP, and other physiologic parameters were measured preinjury, postinjury, and post-treatment. A 53.0-gram clip compression injury at the T1 spinal segment was delivered for 1 minute to three treatment groups (saline, adrenalin, and adrenalin plus nimodipine) comprised of five rats each. Injury caused a marked decline in SCBF and mSAP. Treatment with adrenalin alone or combined with nimodipine (1.5 micrograms/kg/min IV) improved mSAP to 100-125 mm Hg. However, adrenalin alone failed to improve SCBF, whereas nimodipine plus adrenalin produced a marked improvement of approximately 60% in post-traumatic SCBF. Morphometric analysis showed no significant difference between per cent area or volume of hemorrhage between the three treatment groups, although there was a trend for increased hemorrhage in the adrenalin-alone group perhaps due to the higher post-traumatic mSAP in this group. Further studies are required to find the minimal elevation in mSAP produced by a vasopressor that would still cause an improvement in post-traumatic SCBF by nimodipine, and to determine whether this combination improves function after spinal cord injury.\r"

To assess the magnitude of problems associated with ocular contamination involving cyanoacrylates, a 12-month prospective study was conducted. 34 cases (21 adult and 13 pediatric) were collected. In all cases, contaminated eyes were thoroughly irrigated with tepid water for 15 minutes. 15 patients (44%) suffered a corneal abrasion, as determined by ophthalmic exam, necessitating treatment with antibiotics, cycloplegics, and patching. Individuals reporting complete resolution were irrigated with 20 minutes of exposure, while patients suffering mechanical injury delayed decontamination for a minimum of 15 minutes. In addition to immediate irrigation of eyes exposed to cyanoacrylates, we recommend an ophthalmologic evaluation to rule out the possibility of mechanical injury.\r"

Immunoassay of semen samples for CTX were not diagnostic, but the sensitivity and timing of the test employed may have precluded detection of small quantities of the toxin. We conclude that CTX may be present in the semen of men affected with ciguatera toxicity and be capable of producing symptomatology in both males and females during sexual intercourse.\r"

  ".W": "The major problem in clinical transplantation is the imbalance between the need for cadaveric organs and the available numbers of donors. If pediatric kidneys were transplanted into adult recipients when no pediatric recipient was available, the potential number of renal donors would be increased by 15 to 20%. Some centers are reluctant to use pediatric kidneys for adult recipients because of recent reports indicating poorer patient and allograft survival, increased delayed graft function, increased post-transplant hypertension and increased technical complication. (There also has been concern that the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporine A would retard the organ growth that is necessary to provide normal renal function in adults.) A retrospective analysis was performed on 18 adult recipients who received kidneys from cadaver donors 14 months to 12 years old (group 1). These patients were compared to 106 adult recipients who received kidneys from donors greater than 12 years old (group 2). Actuarial patient survival at 1 year was 85% for group 1 and 95.8% for group 2 (p equals 0.13), while 1-year actuarial allograft survival was 83.1% for group 1 and 81.1% for group 2 (p equals 0.87). There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in the frequency of delayed graft function, serum creatinine at 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation, incidence of post-transplant hypertension or frequency of surgical complications. It is of interest that the pediatric kidneys had significant growth during the initial post-transplant month. Sonographic examination at postoperative days 1 and 30 demonstrated a mean increase in size from 80.7 to 143.5 cm. (p less than 0.001). In this series pediatric kidneys were safe and effective donor organs in adult recipients, and increased the available number of organs by 15%.\r"

If ureteroscopy was successful a ureteral stent was placed and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was applied to more proximal renal and upper ureteral calculi. Of 28 renal units 25 (89%) were rendered free of stones or had passable calculi of less than 3 mm. in diameter after a single combined treatment. This combined approach appears to be safe, effective and efficient.\r"

  ".W": "In 210 patients with urolithiasis extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed without regional, general or infiltration anesthesia by means of a technically unmodified Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. The stone burden varied from small ureteral stones to complete staghorn stones. All patients were given premedication with pethidine and diazepam, and a lidocaine-prilocaine-containing cream was applied on the skin at the entry site of the shock wave. Energy usually varied between 14 and 16 kv. More than 90% of the patients reported the pain to be at most of moderate intensity and acceptable. Less than 3% found the treatment unpleasant. The results were compared to those obtained in 250 patients treated with anesthesia according to the original procedure, with a generator voltage of 18 to 23 kv. The number of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy sessions for ureteral and large stones was somewhat higher with the low energy method than with the original procedure. However, the therapeutic result in terms of renal units without stones after 4 weeks was similar to that recorded for patients treated with the anesthesia method. According to these promising results we believe that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy without anesthesia in an unmodified Dornier HM3 lithotriptor can be performed successfully in a majority of patients and is an attractive alternative to other technical modifications of the equipment.\r"

The different forms of urinary diversion were compared for patient selection, operative technical demands, postoperative complications, perioperative renal function and short-term followup, including rehospitalizations, revisions and pouch function. Patient selection was the same for the ileal conduit and Indiana pouch groups. Kock pouch patients were more highly selected for youth and health status. The operative technical demands of the ileal conduit and Indiana pouch were similar. The average operative time and blood loss for cystectomy and ileal conduit were 5 hours 27 minutes and 1,290 cc versus 5 hours 30 minutes and 1,201 cc for the Indiana pouch group. Postoperative complications and changes in renal function were similar among all 3 groups except for an increase in urinary anastomotic leaks in heavily irradiated ileal conduit patients. The ileal conduit patients required no rehospitalizations or revisions, the Indiana pouch group had 4 rehospitalizations and no revisions, and the Kock pouch group had 9 rehospitalizations and 3 revisions. The day and nighttime continence rate was 100% in the Indiana and Kock pouch groups. The Indiana pouch has similar technical demands as the ileal conduit, similar postoperative complications as the ileal conduit or Kock pouch, and functions well with a low revision rate. We conclude that the modified Indiana pouch can be accomplished safely and effectively in any patient requiring an ileal conduit.\r"

Encouraging results have been obtained with the Kock pouch, which offers a low pressure reservoir, safe reflux protection and a reliable continent abdominal wall stoma. If urethral function could be saved without risk, anastomosis of a bowel bladder to the urethral stump is more favorable as far as cosmetics and continence are concerned. The S bladder, developed on the basis of the S pouch, is conceptualized to be a complete replacement of the lower urinary tract that offers a low pressure reservoir, safe antireflux mechanisms, continence and voiding per urethram with abdominal straining. We treated 78 patients with continent urinary diversion (Kock pouch in 46 and S bladder in 32). Continence was achieved in 87% of the patients treated with a Kock pouch, while 93.8% were continent in the S bladder group. In an effort to achieve continence day and night 43.8% of the patients treated with an S bladder required an artificial sphincter. The over-all complication rate (12.5 compared to 41.8%) and the operative complication rate (6.3 compared to 23.9%) were significantly lower in patients treated with the S bladder. Emptying by abdominal straining was possible in all patients with an S bladder. Residuals were less than 50 cc, even in patients with an artificial sphincter.\r"

A total of 19 patients underwent cystectomy after chemotherapy.

The over-all survival for patients with a pathological or surgical complete response is 76.9%. In the patients not operated upon because of persistent or advanced disease after chemotherapy survival was brief (less than 4 months). Prolonged survival in patients achieving a pathological or surgical complete response with neoadjuvant chemotherapy occurs, and this modality may have a role in patients with invasive tumors.\r"

To avoid complications, meshed split thickness skin graft or foreskin was used to construct a neourethra. In stage 1 split thickness skin graft is harvested and transplanted along the opened urethra. In stage 2 the neourethra is formed 8 to 12 weeks later. Since 1977 mesh graft urethroplasty has been performed in 96 patients using meshed foreskin (76) or split thickness skin grafts (23). In all but 1 patient excellent anatomical and functional results were achieved regardless of which type of graft was used. This technique was most useful in exceedingly long or problematic strictures, for example in spinal cord injury patients.\r"

The occurrence of incontinence is unpredictable and the relationship of incontinence to operative technique is unclear. We compared urinary continence in 68 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. In 34 patients nonnerve-sparing radical prostatectomy was performed and in 34 subsequent patients a nerve-sparing operation was done. Patient age, Gleason score and stage of the tumor, and operative time were not significantly different between the groups. In the nonnerve-sparing operated group there were 4 patients (12%) with total and 6 (18%) with stress incontinence requiring absorbent pads, compared to 0 and 2 (6%), respectively, in the nerve-sparing group. The postoperative functional urethral length in the nonnerve-sparing group was 1.9 +/- 0.6 cm. (standard deviation) and in the nerve-sparing group it was 2.3 +/- 0.5 cm., which was significantly different (p less than 0.05). The peak resting urethral pressure of the nonnerve-sparing group was 35.4 +/- 14.2 cm. water and in the nerve-sparing group it was 46.5 +/- 12.3 cm. water, which also was significantly different (p less than 0.05). The study indicates that preservation of the pelvic nerves during radical prostatectomy has a major role in the functional preservation of urinary continence.\r"

Surgery included retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in 92 patients, thoracotomy in 19 and hepatic resection in 1 (11 patients underwent 2 operations). Complete necrosis and/or fibrosis was found in 52 operative specimens, mature teratoma in 37 and vital malignant tumor in 12. Of the 11 patients who underwent 2 operations 4 had complete necrosis and/or fibrosis in both histological specimens. After a median observation of 55 months 83 of 89 patients with complete necrosis and/or fibrosis or mature teratoma were without evidence of disease. Only 7 of 12 patients with vital malignant tumor in the operative specimen survived without evidence of disease. Relapses were observed in 16 patients, 4 of them in the retroperitoneal space. Of the 16 relapses 5 were in 12 patients with residual vital malignant tumor, 5 in 37 patients with post-chemotherapy mature teratoma and 4 in 52 patients with complete necrosis and/or fibrosis after chemotherapy. Two patients with recurrence did not undergo an operation. In patients in whom post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is considered complete necrosis and/or fibrosis can be predicted by the combination of several factors, including absence of teratomatous elements in the testicular tumor, complete response on post-chemotherapy computerized tomography, and normal alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin levels after chemotherapy (sensitivity 83%, specificity 76% and correctly predicted 79%). With the knowledge of these factors it seems possible to omit post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in approximately 20% of the patients with advanced metastatic nonseminomatous testicular cancer with initial retroperitoneal tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of stage A2 prostate cancer is unknown. Previous studies from this institution have shown that, without treatment, a third of the men with clinically localized stage A2 prostatic adenocarcinoma will have disease progression within 4 years. Presently, most patients who present with stage A2 prostate cancer receive surgical or radiation therapy. The degree of differentiation of the tumor (Gleason score) presently is used to predict the prognosis among patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. The Gleason score does well to predict the prognosis for patients with scores of 2 to 4 and 8 to 10. Unfortunately, the majority of patients fall within the range of Gleason scores of 5 to 7. Better methods are needed to predict which patients diagnosed with stage A2 prostate cancer have a high probability of disease progression. Several studies have reported that morphometrically determined nuclear shape descriptors provided accurate separation of these patients that was superior to Gleason grading methods. To evaluate critically the usefulness of nuclear morphometry for prediction of prognosis we developed a system. The Hopkins Morphometry System, that calculated and compared 15 different shape descriptors that were analyzed by 17 different statistical tests. We tested this system on 18 untreated patients with stage A2 prostate cancer with an average followup of 10.5 years (range 5 to 18 years). For each patient 17 statistical analyses of the 15 shape descriptors (255 total) were evaluated and 50 analyses (50 of 255, 19.6%), including average nuclear roundness factor, provided significant separation (p less than 0.01) of the patients on the basis of outcome, whereas the Gleason score (p equals 0.076) did not. The best separation (p less than 0.01) was provided by the lower quartile analysis of the ellipticity shape descriptor.\r"

  ".W": "From 1966 to 1980, 315 patients underwent bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy without adjuvant treatment for clinically and pathologically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Followup was 5 to 21 years, with a median of 8 years. The disease was pathological stage A in 24 patients (8%) and pathological stage B in 291 (92%). A total of 45 patients (14.2%) experienced progression. Over-all, 28 patients (8.9%) suffered local recurrence at a mean of 6.6 years postoperatively (median 5.5 years). Local recurrence was noted as late as 15 years postoperatively. Over-all, systemic progression was observed in 25 patients (8%) after a mean of 4.7 years (median 6 years). Eight patients (2.5%) experienced local and systemic failure. The projected local and systemic failure rates at 15 years were 22% and 15%, respectively. Disease-specific survival at 15 years was 93%, since only 11 patients (3.4%) died of prostate cancer. In an age-matched case control analysis, after all prognostic variables were analyzed (Mayo grade, Gleason score, capsule involvement, number of foci, volume of tumor and deoxyribonucleic acid tumor ploidy), progression was related to nondiploid deoxyribonucleic acid tumor ploidy (p less than 0.0004) as determined by flow cytometry in 63% of the patients who evidenced progression versus 8% of the nonrecurrent group.\r"

A total of 31 consecutive patients with pathological stage C disease received 45 to 55 Gy. adjuvant external beam radiation postoperatively. Actuarial 5 and 10-year survival rates free of disease were 92%, with a local recurrence rate of 3% and a distant recurrence rate of 6% at a mean followup of 5 years. Sixteen consecutive pathological stage D1 cancer patients received 45 to 60 Gy. adjuvant external beam radiation alone (4), adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy alone with cyclophosphamide (5) or combined adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy (7). Actuarial 5 and 10-year survival rates free of disease were 86% with no local recurrences and a distant recurrence rate of 12% at a mean followup of 5 years. These results provide further evidence to support the use of adjuvant external beam radiation therapy in the management of pathological stage C disease. Our preliminary results suggest that an aggressive, multidisciplinary approach is warranted in pathological stage D1 disease and that adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without adjuvant radiation, may have a role in prolonging survival free of disease in this high risk group.\r"

The magnesium-to-calcium ratio in the basalt areas was higher than in the other areas, while ratio in the granite areas was low. In the sedimentary rock areas calcium and magnesium concentrations were high; the magnesium-to-calcium ratio in these areas was between those of the basalt and granite areas. The limestone areas had a much higher calcium concentration. The incidence of urinary stones in the sedimentary rock and basalt areas was lower than that of the granite areas, while that in the limestone areas was the highest. Thus, the incidence of urinary stone is related to the magnesium-to-calcium ratio in tap water and the geological area.\r"

This difference was statistically highly significant. Each of these patients ingested approximately 120 cephalexin tablets per year of postcoital prophylaxis. Postcoital oral cephalexin prophylaxis is highly effective in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection in the nonpregnant as well as pregnant premenopausal women because of easy compliance, the high urine concentration achieved and the minimal induction of resistance to cephalexin in the introital gram-negative bacterial flora. Postcoital cephalexin prophylaxis achieves identical results to daily cephalexin prophylaxis but uses only a third of the tablets required in the daily regimens. Finally, cephalexin represents an additional valuable antibacterial drug in postcoital prophylaxis along with cotrimoxazole, nitrofurantoin and cinoxacin.\r"

Although endopyelotomy or ureteropelvic junction dilation should be considered in patients who fail pyeloplasty, ureterocalicostomy continues to be a reliable salvage procedure in these patients; it bypasses extensive peripelvic scarring, provides for dependent drainage and compensates for lack of adequate ureteral length.\r"

The majority of these patients will undergo treatment without knowledge of whether the tumor would have progressed during their lifetime. Because more patients are being diagnosed yearly with early stage prostate cancers it is becoming increasingly important to delineate factors that will clarify which patients have tumors with invasive potential. Using the Dunning R-3327 rat prostate animal tumor model we have previously shown that an increase in cell surface charge, as measured by individual cell electrophoresis, is associated with an increase in metastatic ability. This electrophoretic technique is limited by the small number of cells that can be analyzed during each assay. Therefore, we adapted a flow cytometric method for measurement of cell surface change, utilizing a large molecule (cationized ferritin) that binds quantitatively to the negative charges at the cell surface. With a fluorescent tag attached to the ferritin molecule, flow cytometric quantification of surface charge was possible, and this method was successful in identifying tumors with high metastatic ability in the Dunning prostate tumor model.\r"

This antibody is specific for a proliferation-associated nuclear antigen. In BPH tissues about 0.3% of nuclei of epithelial cells was reactive with Ki-67. The Ki-67 positive nuclei were distributed equally among the basal and luminal cells of the hyperplastic prostatic acini. In prostatic cancer the Ki-67 defined growth fraction ranged from 0.4% to 9.1% (mean value 2.9%). Cancers with a cribriform growth pattern and tumors composed of solid areas of undifferentiated cancer cells showed the highest growth fraction (average values 4.0%, respectively 7.6%). The investigated four tumors composed of undifferentiated solitary tumor cells with diffuse infiltration of the stroma demonstrated an unexpectedly low growth activity (average 1.2%). In cancers with a glandular growth pattern the Ki-67 defined growth fraction of tumor cells varied from 2.2% to 5%. Compared with other epithelial tumors these values are low, but they are in agreement with the earlier findings on prostatic cancer obtained with 3H-thymidine labeling and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. The observed variation in the level of Ki-67 defined growth activity partly related to the histological tumor pattern suggests that Ki-67 labeling may serve as a prognostic factor additional to the current histopathological grading criteria of prostatic cancer.\r"

Precipitates were identified by X-ray powder diffraction and the artificially encrusted surfaces examined by scanning electron microscopy. In the presence of protein, hydroxyapatite was precipitated as a poorly crystalline form which aggregated to form a crust. Struvite crystals could be easily identified under the scanning electron microscope by their relatively large size and characteristic appearance. Fifteen encrusted catheters from patients were also examined by scanning electron microscopy, and a further six using X-ray microanalysis. Their appearance was very similar to that of the materials encrusted in vitro. Encrustation involves the formation of hydroxyapatite and the growth of struvite crystals, intimately associated with bacteria.\r"

A modified cystoscope admits an isotropic light source (fiber with diffusing tip, connected to a dye laser) and three translucent nylon catheters that are unfolded in three directions along the bladder wall. An isotropic light detector (0.8 mm. diameter probe on 200 microns. fiber) is inserted into each catheter and connected to an amplifier displaying light dose rate (in mW/cm.2) and integrated light dose (in J/cm.2) for each probe. Before treatment a low light level is used to optimize the position of the light source, requiring equal readings by each of the three dosimetry probes. Uniformity of irradiation is checked by moving the probes through their respective catheters along the bladder wall. With red light (wavelength 630 nm.) a dose rate uniformity of +/- 20% could be achieved in vivo in dog bladder. With green light (514.5 nm.) uniform irradiation was difficult, most likely due to a much smaller contribution of scattered light. Measurements during clinical PDT show that optimizing the light source position by suprapubic transvesical ultrasound may not secure uniform irradiation. Half-way into the treatment a difference of 100% between the readings of two probes was noted. Adjusting the position of the light source resulted in integrated light dose variations of less than 20% among the three probes at the end of treatment.\r"

Tension on the anchors was measured and maintained by springs positioned between pairs of anchors. At two months evaluation, vascular graft and loops of suture retained 40% of the starting tension, while two sizes of screw anchors lost all tension. Silicone pads and kink free silicone tubing rapidly pulled through the tissue in 83% and 100% of the cases, respectively. Local tissue reaction with scar formation, physical characteristics of the anchor material (silicone, stainless steel, dacron or polypropolene) and cross sectional area of the anchor were identified as the important factors for anchor stabilization of tissue which has been repositioned under tension.\r"

EGFr binds the mitogenic polypeptide hormone epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as EGF-related transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). Increases in EGFr gene expression and protein production have been implicated in the development of the malignant phenotype for certain cancers. To determine if alterations in EGFr gene expression are present in human renal cell carcinoma, paired samples of normal and neoplastic renal tissue from ten patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma were analyzed for EGFr mRNA content by Northern blot hybridization. The EGFr gene was constitutively expressed in 90% of normal kidney samples. In seven out of nine evaluable patients, tumors expressed 1.7 to 8.4 times more EGFr mRNA than corresponding normal tissue. Two patients showed no elevation of tumor EGFr mRNA and one patient had no identifiable EGFr transcripts in either neoplastic or normal kidney. Expression of EGFr mRNA was also detected in three tumor-derived and two established renal cell carcinoma cell lines. EGFr transcripts were not found in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). These findings suggest that overexpression of EGFr mRNA may be associated with malignant transformation in renal cell carcinomas.\r"

In the present study, we have determined whether or not left adrenal products are important to the changes induced by ELV and whether or not reflux of left renal vein content occurs in the ELV rat. In the first study, testicular blood flow and temperature were studied in control animals and those with ELV, left adrenalectomy (LAX), or ELV + LAX. Control left and right testicular blood flow (33.6 +/- 0.8 and 33.6 +/- 1.5 ml./min./100 gm. tissue respectively) was significantly elevated by ELV (to 39.9 +/- 0.9 and 41.2 +/- 2.7 ml./min./100 gm. tissue, respectively) and the difference between abdominal and testicular temperatures (delta T) was significantly reduced. Control delta T's for right and left testes were 3.2 +/- 0.2C and 3.2 +/- 0.2C, respectively, and right and left delta T's for ELV animals were 2.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C and 2.0 +/- 0.3C, respectively. These blood flow and temperature changes also occurred when ELV animals were subjected to simultaneous LAX. Additionally, when 85Sr-labelled microspheres were infused into the left renal vein, they did not appear in either left or right testes of ELV animals. We conclude that there is no evidence for reflux down the spermatic vein in ELV in rats and adrenal products do not reach the testis via this route after being secreted into the renal vein. We raise the suggestion that the same may be true in the human.\r"

  ".W": "The immunomodulator ABPP (2-amino-5-iodo-6-phenyl-4(3H) pyrimidinone) is an interferon inducer and has been shown to have in vivo activity against the murine bladder tumor MBT-2. Two experiments were performed to determine if ABPP might enhance the in vivo anti-tumor activity of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). First, in vivo stimulation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity by BCG and ABPP was measured in C3H mice using a chromium-release assay. An earlier, greater, and longer-lasting increase in cytotoxicity was caused by ABPP than by BCG. Based on the differing times to peak cytotoxic stimulation, groups of 15 mice each were pretreated intraperitoneally at different times prior to inoculation with MBT-2. Compared to saline, ABPP alone did not increase survival, while BCG alone did increase survival (p less than 0.01), and the combination of BCG and ABPP yielded the highest survival (p less than 0.001). These results indicate that 1) ABPP affects the immune system differently than BCG, and 2) while ABPP may have less single-agent activity against MBT-2 than BCG, ABPP may serve to potentiate the activity of BCG.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate prospectively those patients with popliteal artery entrapment. To define the syndrome, the methods used in diagnosis and the type of anatomic anomaly were established for each patient. From 1977 to 1988, 12 patients were found to have popliteal artery entrapment. The average age was 27 years, with all but three patients under age 40 years. All patients complained of calf claudication, and one had acute ischemia. The ankle pulses decreased with maneuvers in 10 patients; four patients had a resting ankle/brachial index less than one. All had diminished ankle/brachial indexes when a treadmill test was performed at 4.2 mph, 10% grade, for 10 minutes. All patients had biplanar arteriography with passive dorsiflexion and active plantar flexion. All results showed abnormal extrinsic compression or occlusion of the popliteal artery. Twenty limbs were affected; eight of 12 patients (67%) had bilateral entrapment. Type IV (37%) lesions were the most common, with type II (32%) and type III (26%) following closely. One (5%) type I lesion and no type V lesions were found. This is the largest single series of patients with popliteal entrapment in the United States. A treadmill test followed by biplanar arteriography established the diagnosis in all patients. Bilateral involvement was twice that reported in previous studies. Popliteal artery entrapment should be considered in the young adult with claudication and may be seen with greater frequency in an increasingly active population.\r"

Double-blind, randomized, perioperative prophylaxis (1 gm intravenously every 6 hours for nine doses) with cefamandole or cefazolin was administered to 47 patients. Specimens of blood serum, subcutaneous fat, thrombus, atheroma, and arterial wall were obtained for culture and minimal inhibitory concentration and drug level analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The serum half-life (hr +/- SEM) was 1.43 +/- 0.36 for cefamandole and 2.22 +/- 0.40 for cefazolin. Over the first 2 hours of surgery and for all time intervals combined, the serum concentration of cefazolin was significantly higher (p less than 0.025) than cefamandole. Irrespective of sampling time, the tissue concentration of cefazolin was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) than cefamandole. Positive arterial tissue cultures were obtained in 12 of 29 patients (41.4%) from 23 of 116 (19.8%) arterial tissue specimens. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was the predominant isolate, 64 of 93 (68.8%). Twenty-five of the 51 coagulase-negative staphylocci tested (49%) were slime-producers. During surgery, the arterial tissue concentration of cefamandole fell below the geometric mean minimal inhibitory concentration against all organisms combined, and against S. aureus (with the highest minimal inhibitory concentration of the prevalent isolates), significantly more often than the concentration of cefazolin. The data show that a significant number of primary elective aortoiliofemoral/infrainguinal reconstructions are associated with positive arterial tissue cultures, which represent a potential source of graft infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The median age was 65 years. All except two patients had diabetes; eight were treated with insulin. One patient had Buerger's disease, and another had vasculitis with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. History of smoking (65%), hypertension (53%), heart disease (71%), and osteomyelitis in the foot (35%), were noted. Cultures were positive in 15 gangrenous feet, 11 with gram-negative bacilli. Four long femoroplantar bypasses were placed. Ten short grafts were placed from the popliteal artery, and six jump grafts were placed distal to a femoropopliteal or tibial bypass. Hospital stay ranged from 8 to 38 days (median 16 days), and there were two in-hospital deaths. Transmetatarsal or button toe amputations were performed in nine feet. There were two below-knee amputations, one with a patent graft, for a foot salvage rate of 89% at 2 months. In four instances the gangrenous ulcers took longer than 6 months to heal; all other wounds healed within 6 months. The primary and secondary patency rates were 85% at 1 month, and 73% at 3 months and thereafter. Four of five graft failures occurred in the two legs with repeat bypass graftings. All patients with successful revascularization are able to walk, and seven returned to work full time.\r"

Primary thrombectomy and balloon dilation were performed in 14 patients, and additional reconstruction was performed in three patients. The superficial femoral artery was the site of thrombectomy and dilation in 13 patients, and the external iliac artery was the site in the remaining five patients. Successful dilation was accomplished in all patients, with stenotic sites reduced below 30% by angiography, and ankle/brachial indexes increased by 0.15 or more. No operative deaths or complications occurred. Follow-up of superficial femoral artery dilations showed a 90% patency rate continued out to 4 years and a 40% patency rate at 5 years. Combined thrombectomy and interventional catheter therapy may aid in the care of this difficult to treat vascular patient group.\r"

We have since encountered three additional patients with nonunited lower extremity fractures occurring in limbs with arterial ischemia. In each of these four patients limb revascularization was undertaken in an effort to stimulate healing of the fracture. These patients had chronic (mean 6 months) nonunion of tibial (three) or femur (one) fractures associated with severe lower extremity ischemia (ankle/brachial index m = 0.33; range 0.24 to 0.5). All patients had histories of chronic lower extremity ischemia before the fracture (ischemic rest pain, 2; claudication, 2). All patients underwent angiography followed by lower extremity revascularization. Restoration of normal arterial supply to the fracture site was followed by healing of the fracture in all patients. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported series of patients undergoing elective limb revascularization to stimulate healing of the fracture. Widespread appreciation of this relationship by orthopedic surgeons may be of considerable clinical importance.\r"

The occlusions were associated with ipsilateral strokes in six (25%), ipsilateral transient ischemic attacks in four (16%), and the onset of nonhemispheric symptoms in one (5%). Thirteen patients had no symptoms. Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 96 months (mean 39.4 months). Late neurologic events comprised two strokes, three transient ischemic attacks and the onset of nonhemispheric symptoms in six, which in some were disabling. Thirteen patients had no symptoms. Three deaths occurred (one was stroke related). For late events by life-table analysis, the average annual rate over the first 2 years for stroke was 10% and for transient ischemic attack 13%. The combined rate for transient ischemic attack and stroke was 20% per annum. For nonhemispheric symptoms the rate for the first year was 31%. It is concluded that unilateral carotid artery occlusion is associated with an unacceptable incidence of immediate neurologic sequelae and that such patients continue to have a high rate of late neurologic deficits at follow-up. Therefore it seems appropriate that patients who are observed to progress to high-grade stenosis and are therefore at risk for immediate occlusion should undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated aneurysms of the internal iliac artery are rare. Their anatomic location makes them true pelvic aneurysms and they may grow to a large size undetected. Their late recognition may be prompted by rupture or symptoms related to compression of neurologic, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or venous structures. We have encountered three isolated hypogastric artery aneurysms with unique presentations. In one patient with bilateral isolated hypogastric artery aneurysms, one ruptured into the bladder, and at a later time the other caused ureteral obstruction. Another patient had obturator neuropathy as a result of his aneurysm. In the patient with large bilateral aneurysms, one was detected by rectal examination, and the other was found by palpation of the abdomen. The second patient with a smaller aneurysm required examination of the pelvis by CT scanning to establish the diagnosis. Awareness of the existence of these lesions is required to identify such patients who describe symptoms uncommonly associated with abdominal aneurysms. Operative management consisted of exclusion of the aneurysm and partial or complete aneurysmorrhaphy with preservation of iliac arterial flow to maintain extremity perfusion. Recovery was complete in each instance. A review of published cases is presented.\r"

Prevalence rates of Alzheimer's disease were calculated for the community population from the sample undergoing clinical evaluation. Of those over the age of 65 years, an estimated 10.3% (95% confidence limits, 8.1% and 12.5%) had probable Alzheimer's disease. This prevalence rate was strongly associated with age. Of those 65 to 74 years old, 3.0% (95% confidence limits, 0.8 and 5.2) had probable Alzheimer's disease, compared with 18.7% (95% confidence limits, 13.2 and 24.2) of those 75 to 84 years old and 47.2% (95% confidence limits, 37.0 and 63.2) of those over 85 years. Other dementing conditions were uncommon. Of community residents with moderate or severe cognitive impairment, 84.1% had clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease as the only probable diagnosis. These data suggest that clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease is a common condition and that its public health impact will continue to increase with increasing longevity of the population.\r"

By 6 months, 90% of the subjects had developed protective levels of antibody to HBsAg (greater than or equal to 10 mIU/mL). Follow-up at 1 year showed a geometric mean concentration of antibodies to HBsAg of 396 mIU/mL for the group, and 95% had levels of antibody to HBsAg greater than or equal to 10 mIU/mL. A level of antibody to HBsAg of greater than 100 mIU/mL also was observed in more than 75% of subjects. Side effects included induration of the inoculation site in 18% at 6 months, which disappeared by 12 months, and macules that persisted at 1 year in 63%. The administration of hepatitis B vaccine intradermally is an attractive, low-cost alternative in the United States, where universal vaccination of preschool children or adolescents is being contemplated, and where booster doses are being considered.\r"

The possible advantages of enrolling HIV-1-positive persons into long-term follow-up are early treatment of clinical conditions and resulting gains in life quality and life expectancy, decreased transmission of HIV-1 to uninfected persons, more efficient use of scarce patient-care resources, and improved estimates of the total number of HIV-infected persons. The possible disadvantages of such a program are adverse psychological reactions to knowledge of HIV-1 infection, adverse societal actions against infected persons, and, finally, the economic cost of the program. These facilities, with the proper expertise and safeguards of confidentiality and trust, could prolong and improve the lives of infected persons while preventing infection of others.\r"
