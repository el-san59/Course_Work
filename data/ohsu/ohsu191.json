  ".W": "Measurement of coronary flow reserve has been suggested as an adjunct to anatomic assessment of coronary stenoses in patients with ischemic heart disease. We compared papaverine hydrochloride and radiographic contrast to determine which agent was superior for the determination of coronary flow reserve. Coronary flow reserve was determined during cardiac catheterization by means of digital coronary angiography and parametric imaging. Two groups of patients were studied. Among patients in group 1, coronary flow reserve was determined by means of both papaverine and contrast. In group 1 patients with normal coronary arteries, papaverine-induced flow reserve was greater than contrast-induced reserve in all but one vascular region (n = 9, 4.98 +/- 1.15 vs 3.56 +/- 0.89; p = 0.29). Group 1 patients with coronary disease also demonstrated significantly greater flow reserve with papaverine (n = 25, 2.57 +/- 0.20 vs 1.83 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.01). Group 2 included patients with single-vessel coronary artery stenoses. These patients were studied by means of either papaverine or contrast to determine coronary flow reserve for both the stenotic \"ischemic\" region and an adjacent nonstenotic, \"nonischemic\" region. Those patients in group 2 who were studied by means of contrast had a modest difference between flow reserve values in the nonischemic and those in the ischemic regions (n = 15, 1.78 +/- 0.10 vs 1.26 +/- 0.09; p less than .0001) with considerable overlap. Patients studied by means of papaverine had a much greater separation in flow reserve between nonischemic and ischemic regions (n = 22, 2.78 +/- 0.19 vs 1.46 +/- 0.14; p less than 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Segmental wall motion was scored with a five-point system (3 = normal; -1 = dyskinesis); a decrease of one score defined the onset of wall motion abnormality. The onset of wall motion abnormality at less than or equal to 70% of maximal predicted heart rate had 100% predictive accuracy for coronary artery disease and higher sensitivity than the onset of ischemic ST segment depression at similar heart rate during exercise: 36% (25 of 69 patients with coronary disease) vs 19% (13 of 69 patients), p = 0.01. Wall motion abnormality occurring at less than or equal to 70% of maximal predicted heart rate was present in 49% of patients (23 of 47) with critical stenosis (greater than or equal to 90% luminal diameter narrowing), and in only 5% of patients (2 of 42) without such severe stenosis, p less than 0.001. The sensitivity of exercise-induced wall motion abnormality occurring at a low heart rate for the presence of severe coronary artery disease was similar to that of a deterioration in wall motion by more than two scores during exercise (49% vs 53%) or an absolute decrease of greater than or equal to 5% in exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (49% vs 45%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We sought to characterize the effect of augmented preexcitation on the phase image pattern associated with scintigraphic acquisition during conduction via accessory arteriovenous connections. For this reason we assessed phase image scintigraphy, acquired in sinus rhythm and during rapid atrial pacing in 12 patients with documented right (five patients) or left (seven patients) lateral accessory pathways. Augmented preexcitation during atrial pacing was documented at electrophysiologic study in all patients during atrial pacing at similar rates. Phase analysis was abnormal in only 8 patients during sinus rhythm but in all 12 patients during atrial pacing. Atrial pacing brought a significant delay in both mean left and right ventricular phase angles, LV phi and RV phi, respectively. With atrial pacing, the site of earliest phase angle, interpreted to indicate the site of earliest excitation, shifted to the site of the accessory pathway. There was increased relative \"prematurity\" of the mean phase angle of the ipsilateral ventricle and an absolute increase in the difference between mean and earliest left and right ventricular phase angles, delta phi (LV-RV) and delta phi 0 (LV-RV), respectively. In patients with right-sided pathways, delta phi (LV-RV) increased from 9.5 +/- 12.6 degrees to 47.9 +/- 22.8 degrees, whereas delta phi 0 (LV-RV) increased from 28.1 +/- 18.0 degrees to 67.6 +/- 25.0 degrees (both p less than 0.05). Patients with left-sided pathways demonstrated similar changes in which delta phi (LV-RV) decreased from 2.9 +/- 10.8 degrees to -26.5 +/- 9.0 degrees and delta phi 0 (LV-RV) decreased from 3.4 +/- 14.2 degrees to -27.4 +/- 17.9 degrees (both p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hemodynamics were measured at AV intervals of 130, 0, and -130 msec during ventricular pacing at a baseline rate that was 10 pulses/min greater than the resting heart rate, at 130 pulses/min alone, and at 130 pulses/min during continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine. During baseline ventricular pacing and during ventricular pacing at 130 pulses/min with and without dobutamine, both groups of patients had a significant decrease in cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index when the AV pacing interval was decreased from 130 to 0 msec. The observed decrease in these three hemodynamic variables was similar when patients with diminished LVEF were compared to patients with normal LVEF. No further significant decrease in cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index occurred in either group when the AV interval was changed from 0 to -130 msec during baseline ventricular pacing or during ventricular pacing at 130 with and without dobutamine. Beneficial hemodynamic effects occur during ventricular pacing when AV synchrony is maintained at resting heart rates and during increases in heart rate and inotropic state in patients with normal and diminished LVEF.\r"

To test whether nicotine and bradykinin produced site-specific vagal vasodepressor and sympathetic vasopressor responses, respectively, we compared blood pressure and heart rate responses to these drugs applied topically at six epicardial sites of the canine left ventricle: midanterior, apical anterior, midlateral, apical lateral, midposterior, and apical posterior left ventricle. In alpha-chloralose-anesthetized dogs with open chests a felt pad soaked in bradykinin (25 micrograms) or nicotine (50 micrograms) was applied to the test sites. Previous studies indicated that epicardial application of these drugs elicited a sympathetically mediated pressor response and a vagally mediated depressor response, respectively. Vasopressor response to bradykinin did not differ among six test sites in 10 dogs. However, vasodepressor response to nicotine was greater in the midposterior left ventricular epicardium than at other test sites in 16 dogs. A hypertensive response after the initial hypotensive response to nicotine was observed in the midanterior left ventricle and not in any other site. These data indicate that vagal vasodepressor responses to epicardial nicotine are greater in the canine midposterior left ventricle and are compatible with the higher incidence of bradycardia or hypotension during acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction in patients. Sympathetic vasopressor responses to epicardial bradykinin are not site specific. Half of the dogs showed no response to bradykinin or nicotine.\r"

Deactivation of the carotid baroreceptors by a decrease in carotid transmural pressure produced a greater (p less than 0.001) increase in mean intra-arterial pressure at rest (+11.2 +/- 0.2 [SE] mm Hg) than during moderate (+9.0 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) and severe (+6.1 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) exercise. Heart interval decreased less (p less than 0.005) at rest (-73 +/- 3.2 msec) than during exercise (-0.7 +/- 0.7 msec and -4.6 +/- 0.2 msec, respectively). Furthermore, activation of the carotid baroreceptors by an increase in carotid transmural pressure provoked a greater (p less than 0.005) reduction in mean intra-arterial pressure at rest (-11.5 +/- 0.2 mm Hg) than during exercise (-9.8 +/- 0.1 mm Hg and -7.5 +/- 0.1 mm Hg, respectively), while the lengthening of heart interval was also more (p less than 0.005) pronounced at rest (+97 +/- 4.3 msec) than during moderate (+44 +/- 1.2 msec) and severe (+7.6 +/- 0.3 msec) exercise. Finally, carotid baroreceptor sensitivity was defined as the slope of the changes in blood pressure and heart interval that occurred with increasing (baroreceptor deactivation) and decreasing (activation) neck tissue pressure. On average, baroreceptor sensitivity was consistently smaller (p less than 0.05) during exercise, as compared to rest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies in animals have demonstrated that calcium channel blocking agents exert important influences on autonomic mechanisms in addition to their direct vascular effects. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that clinical doses of nifedipine sensitized baroreceptor-mediated control of peripheral vascular resistance in normal human subjects. However, baroreflex control of vascular tone does not necessarily imply parallel control of heart rate. A series of experiments was therefore performed to test the hypothesis that therapeutic doses of nifedipine would potentiate arterial baroreflex modulation of heart rate during ramp increases of arterial pressure in normal volunteers. Arterial baroreflex control was assessed by measuring heart interval (HI) responses to dynamic ramp elevation of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) with bolus administration of phenylephrine (PE) before and after nifedipine or placebo in 19 normal subjects. Arterial baroreflex control was calculated from the slope of the regression of SAP on succeeding HI during the first 18 cardiac cycles following onset of rise of SAP after PE bolus. In 13 subjects, bolus PE produced an increase in SAP from 125 +/- 3 mm Hg to 152 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), with a resultant increase in HI from 1110 +/- 57 msec to 1541 +/- 87 msec (p less than 0.01). The baroreflex response was linear (r greater than 0.80, p less than 0.025) and = 17.8 +/- 3.3 msec/mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the structure and function of the right ventricle have received little attention. The present study was designed to assess right ventricular structural changes in patients with established essential hypertension. To accomplish this, M-mode echocardiograms were obtained from 15 healthy normotensive subjects and 35 patients with essential hypertension-15 with normal left ventricles and 20 with clear-cut echocardiographic evidence of LVH. In comparison with the normotensive subjects, right ventricular wall thickness was increased almost twofold in the hypertensive patients with LVH (7.0 +/- 2.1 mm vs 3.7 +/- 0.8 mm; p less than 0.001); there was a significant, direct correlation between right and left ventricular wall thickness in the entire patient population (r = 0.65; p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the left atrial emptying index was significantly reduced in all patients with hypertension regardless of whether LVH was present (p less than 0.001) and suggests early diastolic functional involvement of the left ventricle in hypertension. We therefore conclude that right ventricular hypertrophy is associated with LVH in patients with hypertension, although the changes of LVH are frequently more obvious to the clinician.\r"

The score was derived from the integrated area of ST segment depression and ST slope in two leads (V5 and a VF), corrected for R wave amplitude, exercise time, and percent of maximum predicted heart rate. The ST segment depression was measured at 80 msec after the J point. There were 34 patients with no significant CAD, 38 patients with one-vessel CAD (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis), and 58 patients with multivessel CAD. The TES showed a considerable scatter in patients with and without CAD. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed different levels of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the cut-point. The TES was similar to ST segment depression in detecting CAD (predictive accuracy, 77% vs 78%, p = NS). A markedly abnormal score (less than -1.0) was seen in 41 patients, of whom 32 (78%) had multivessel CAD. On the other hand, a score greater than 0 was seen in 49 patients, of whom 40 (82%) had no or one-vessel CAD. In 40 patients with TES between -1.0 and 0, 17 (43%) had multivessel CAD and 23 (57%) had no or one-vessel CAD. In 51 patients with nondiagnostic ST changes, the TES correctly classified the extent of CAD in 20 patients (40%). Thus, the TES has a similar accuracy to the ST segment depression criteria in detecting CAD. The extent of CAD can, however, be ascertained in 80% of the patients with very high or very low TES.\r"

Adiposity, heart rate, alcohol intake, hematocrit, blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides are all related to the occurrence of hypertension in one or both sexes. These factors also contribute to the occurrence of the cardiovascular sequelae of hypertension. The influence of blood pressure on the incidence of cardiovascular disease is independent of other predisposing cofactors but is greatly affected by them. Elevated pressures are often accompanied by hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, elevated fibrinogen, and ECG abnormalities, all of which augment the risk. Coronary disease is now the most common sequela of hypertension, and the excess risk is concentrated in those with an increased low-density lipoprotein/high density lipoprotein ratio, impaired glucose tolerance, and ECG abnormalities, and in cigarette smokers. Hypertension is only a component of a multifactorial coronary risk profile which must be considered when implementing optimal therapy. Both the urgency for treatment and judgment of efficacy should be guided by the multivariate risk profile.\r"

  ".W": "Like tissues in other parts of the body, those of the heart and blood vessels can rapidly adapt their design. The principles of these differentiated structural changes in response to altered functional demands will be outlined in this report. With respect to arterial resistance vessels in hypertension, any sustained arterial pressure elevation leads to wall (w) hypertrophy, whereas the average inner radius (ri) decreases. The reverse occurs at sustained pressure reductions, and this process is aptly termed \"structural autoregulation.\" By means of this structural autoregulation, wall tension per unit layer (T) remains largely constant when pressure (P) increases (decreases), according to Laplace's law: T = P X r/w. Furthermore, this structural w/ri increase, because it is a local vascular response although it is often considerably modified by neurohormonal \"trophic\" influences, results in a geometrically based vascular hyperreactivity affecting the systemic precapillary resistance vessels, whereas the structural ri reduction leads to an upward resetting of systemic resistance to flow which is present even at maximal vasodilation (Rmin). Because of this \"structural amplifier\" principle, an increased systemic resistance can be maintained even at normal vascular smooth muscle activity, and smooth muscle activations may then lead to exaggerated resistance elevations. Thus, a most important positive-feedback interaction is created between even mild functional \"pressor\" influences, if adequately sustained, and this normal process of structural adaptation. This positive-feedback interaction therefore gradually tends to accentuate the latter element until it entirely dominates the hemodynamics of established hypertension. As the process is induced early and established rapidly, and in primary hypertension often even seems to be genetically reinforced in various ways, it becomes of utmost pathogenetic significance. With respect to the aorta-large conduit arteries, their \"Windkessel function\" becomes reduced by the same process of adaptive wall thickening. This increases the pulse amplitude and thereby accentuates the systolic afterload of the left heart, the load of which is raised also because of the upward structural resetting of systemic precapillary resistance. Furthermore, the same type of structural adaptation also contributes to the upward resetting of the cardiac, arterial, and renal \"barostat\" mechanisms, as cardiac and arterial walls become thicker and stiffer, whereas renal preglomerular resistance vessels participate in the upward structural autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Usually, when antihypertensive therapy is considered in the hypertensive patient, structural cardiovascular changes are already well established and the structure of the cardiovascular system is redesigned to maintain higher than normal pressure. Left ventricular hypertrophy has been shown to be an independent risk factor for all manifestations of coronary heart disease. In hypertension, the increased pressure load over a long period of time induces degenerative changes in, for example, cerebral, renal, and coronary vessels, with well-known clinical consequences. Independent of the primary cause of hypertension, full reversal to normotension will probably occur only when the structurally reset cardiovascular system has been returned to normal dimensions by regression of structural vascular changes. In animal models several forms of antihypertensive treatment have prevented the development of or induced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy as well as medial hypertrophy of the vessels. These effects have been related both to the extent of blood pressure reduction and to the degree of inhibition of neurohormonal trophic influences. In humans the results have been somewhat contradictory. Plethysmography has demonstrated a reduction of resistance at maximal dilatation with either combination therapy or pindolol but not with mefruside or atenolol. There may be several explanations for the difficulties in showing regression of structural vascular changes in humans: (1) inadequate treatment of high blood pressure, (2) reflexogenic activation of neurohormonal trophic factors, (3) investigation of an unsuitable vascular bed, or (4) treatment started too late. The ultimate goal in the treatment of hypertension is, of course, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but normalization of structural cardiovascular changes is clearly the second most important therapeutic goal.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in humans have shown that chronic elevation of blood pressure induces early alterations in the large arteries, consisting mainly of increased diameter, increased pulse wave velocity, and decreased arterial compliance. Acute reduction of blood pressure, per se, does not necessarily correct these alterations homogeneously. For instance, cadralazine reduced brachial artery diameter and urapidil decreased pulse wave velocity, without accompanying changes in forearm arterial compliance. In contrast, acebutolol, isosorbide dinitrate, nicardipine, and nitrendipine, for the same acute decrease in blood pressure, improved forearm arterial compliance by a concomitant decrease in pulse wave velocity and increase in arterial diameter. To determine whether or not these vascular effects persist with long-term acebutolol therapy, nine hypertensive patients were treated for a period of 3 months. Forearm hemodynamic and cytosolic free calcium concentrations in platelets were simultaneously assessed before and after treatment. Compared with placebo baseline values, chronic acebutolol therapy significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), pulse wave velocity (p less than 0.01), and platelet free calcium concentration (p less than 0.05); forearm arterial compliance was increased (p less than 0.01), but brachial artery diameter did not change. Platelet calcium concentration correlated closely with pulse wave velocity even at constant mean arterial pressure. These findings suggest a relaxant effect of acebutolol on the smooth musculature of large arteries, which is independent of changes in blood pressure and arterial diameter, and possibly mediated by changes in cytosolic calcium levels.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about whether cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is of long-term prognostic significance. The mortality rate in 849 patients with confirmed AMI was analyzed. The mortality rate during the initial hospitalization was higher for patients in whom VT/VF occurred (27% vs 7%, p less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality rate for patients with primary VT/VF, that is, VT/VF occurring in the absence of hypotension or heart failure, was similar to that of patients who did not have VT/VF (8% vs 7%, difference not significant), whereas the rate for patients with secondary VT/VF was significantly greater than that for patients with no VT/VF (51% vs 7%, p less than 0.001). The timing of occurrence of VT/VF also influenced mortality: Patients in whom VT/VF occurred more than 72 hours after admission had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than did patients in whom it occurred within 72 hours (57% vs 20%, p less than 0.05). All cases of primary VT/VF occurred within the first 72 hours of admission. The long-term mortality rate for hospital survivors was not significantly different for patients who had had VT/VF during acute infarction compared with those who had not (19% vs 21%) (mean follow-up 32 months). Thus, cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate but was not a prognostic factor among hospital survivors. Patients resuscitated from primary VT/VF, which characteristically occurs early after AMI, do not have an adverse prognosis.\r"

Only 1 (1%; 95% confidence limits 0.02 to 5%) and 4 (6%; 95% confidence limits 2 to 15%) of those with normal and nonspecific initial electrocardiographic findings, respectively, had a complication for which they potentially benefited from intensive care unit intervention, although many patients received prophylactic therapy. Thus, the initial emergency room electrocardiogram can effectively separate patients into high- and low-risk groups for AMI and serious complications. Admission to a monitored intermediate care ward may be an acceptable practice in patients with chest pain and a normal or minimally changed initial electrocardiogram.\r"

To study the prognostic implications of \"silent\" myocardial ischemia induced by exercise, exercise electrocardiography and radionuclide angiography were performed in 131 consecutive patients with CAD, preserved left ventricular (LV) function at rest and mild or no symptoms during medical therapy. All patients who died during medical therapy were in the subgroup of patients with 3-vessel CAD in whom exercise-induced ischemia developed, which was characterized by both a decrease in LV ejection fraction and ST-segment depression. Patients in whom angina pectoris developed during exercise (54% of all patients) had a greater prevalence of this combined ischemic response to exercise than patients without angina (61% vs 27%, p less than 0.001) and also a greater prevalence of left main or 3-vessel CAD (59% vs 25%, p less than 0.001). However, when inducible ischemia was demonstrated, risk stratification and prognosis were the same whether the ischemic episode was symptomatic or silent. Among patients having both a reduction in ejection fraction and a positive ST-segment response, the likelihood of significant left main narrowing (13% vs 26%), 3-vessel CAD (56% vs 51%) and death during subsequent medical therapy (16% vs 9%) was similar in patients with silent compared to those with symptomatic ischemia. These data indicate that patients in whom angina develops during exercise have a greater prevalence of high-risk coronary anatomy and of inducible ischemia than patients without angina. However, once inducible ischemia is documented, the symptomatic response to exercise appears irrelevant for prognostic or risk stratification considerations.\r"

Among the first 150 patients in whom coronary arteriography was performed by a physician assistant, no patient died or had a myocardial infarction or stroke. Two patients (1.3%) had minor complications: a retinal embolus and an infected puncture site. The complication rate in 150 consecutive cases performed by fellows was also 1.3%, a small myocardial infarction and a transient ischemic attack. Procedure times for the physician assistant and for the fellows were 41 +/- 13 and 44 +/- 18 minutes for preoperative patients and 62 +/- 24 and 70 +/- 20 minutes for postoperative patients. Corresponding fluoroscopy times were 11 +/- 5 and 12 +/- 7 minutes for the preoperative and 22 +/- 12 and 20 +/- 6 for postoperative patients.

The clinical and angiographic features of the 2 groups were similar. More sites per patient were attempted among those who underwent multilesion PTCA. Primary success rate per lesion was 86% (236 of 274) among those who underwent multivessel and 73% (155 of 211) among those who underwent multilesion PTCA (p less than 0.001). A success rate of 81% (101 of 124) for proximal lesions among those with multilesion PTCA was not significantly worse than that for those with multivessel PTCA; however, lesions distal to proximal sites had a success rate of only 62% (54 of 87), worse than either those with proximal stenoses or multivessel PTCA (p less than 0.005). Arterial diameter, severity of stenosis or procedural variables did not account for this difference. Complication rates were similar in the 2 groups. Despite a poorer success rate among patients with multilesion PTCA, clinical improvement to functional class 0 or 1 occurred in more than 70% of patients in both groups and was equal in patients with and without successful distal dilatations.

The groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, number of inflations performed, peak inflation pressure or in the pre- or post-PTCA stenosis or gradient. The time from PTCA to onset of recurrent angina was the most powerful predictor of angiographic outcome. Patients in whom symptoms developed within 1 month of PTCA usually had incomplete revascularization or no coronary narrowing. Restenosis was the most common explanation for chest pain 1 to 6 months after PTCA. Angina recurring more than 6 months after PTCA was usually due to development of new, significant coronary artery narrowings.\r"

All patients presented with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and stable or unstable angina pectoris. ST-segment analysis was based on high-resolution trend recordings. During balloon inflations all patients had significant (at least 0.1 mV) ST-segment changes in lead CM5. In lead CC5, associated ST-segment deviations were found in 22 of 26 patients. During 29.2 +/- 13.6 hours before PTCA, 90 spontaneous episodes with significant ST-segment deviations were detected in 10 patients. Of these episodes, 17% were characterized by ST-segment deviations in lead CC5 only, 57% by ST-segment deviations in lead CM5 only, and 27% by simultaneous ST-segment deviations in both leads. Asymptomatic episodes occurred twice as frequently as symptomatic episodes (66 vs 34%). Symptomatic episodes were more often characterized by ST-segment deviations of at least 0.15 mV (48 vs 9%, p less than 0.001) and by ST-segment deviations observed in both leads simultaneously (48 vs 15%, p less than 0.001). During 34.8 +/- 10.6 hours after successful PTCA, 5 spontaneous asymptomatic episodes with significant ST-segment deviations were detected in 2 patients.\r"

Analysis was based on mortality data collected in a standardized manner for the past 38 years for each death among the 5,209 persons in the original cohort. The necessary assumptions about the cause and timing of unwitnessed deaths were made in a manner likely to diminish the possibility of detecting an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death during the morning. In the Framingham study, analyses using these assumptions reveal a significant circadian variation (p less than 0.01) in occurrence of sudden cardiac death (n = 429), with a peak incidence from 7 to 9 AM and a decreased incidence from 9 AM to 1 PM. Risk of sudden cardiac death was at least 70% higher during the peak period than was the average risk during other times of the day. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding in other populations, to collect data regarding medications and to determine activity immediately before sudden cardiac death. Investigation of physiologic changes occurring during the period of increased incidence of sudden cardiac death may provide increased insight into its causes and suggest possible means of prevention.\r"

Detailed records of catheter testing and use were maintained. No complications were encountered during the study period. All re-used catheters functioned for cardiac pacing and electrographic recording. Surveillance cultures and biologic indicators revealed that adequate sterilization procedures were used. Thus, electrode catheters may be safely re-used provided a thorough cleaning, testing and record-keeping system is instituted.

  ".W": "Preexcitation of the atria during reciprocating tachycardia (RT) by a premature ventricular complex occurring when the His bundle is refractory provides direct evidence of the presence of accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. The impact of ventricular stimulation site and RT cycle length on inducibility of atrial preexcitation was assessed in 38 patients with RT utilizing a single accessory AV connection (right free wall in 5 patients, left free wall in 21 and posterior septal/paraseptal in 12). Extrastimuli were inserted at right ventricular (RV) apical, left ventricular (LV) septal and LV free wall sites. Inducibility of and magnitude of atrial preexcitation increased as stimulation site approached accessory AV connection site. Thus, for RV free wall connections, RV extrastimuli preexcited the atria in 5 of 5 patients, LV septal in 1 of 5 and LV free wall in 0 of 4. For LV free wall accessory connections, RV extrastimuli preexcited the atria in only 3 of 21 patients, compared with 12 of 17 with LV septal and 20 of 21 with LV free wall stimulation. Additionally, the magnitude of atrial preexcitation achieved was related to RT cycle length, diminishing as cycle length shortened. Finally, in a few instances both RV apical and LV free wall extrastimuli failed to elicit preexcitation in patients with a posterior septal connection. Thus, ventricular pacing site and RT cycle length contribute importantly to induction of atrial preexcitation by ventricular extrastimulation technique and should be considered during evaluation of patients with RT in whom accessory AV connections may be present.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term efficacy and tolerance of spironolactone in essential hypertension was evaluated among 20,812 patients referred to the Broussais and St. Joseph systemic hypertension clinics between 1976 and 1985 by using information prospectively collected in the computerized ARTEMIS data bank. In 182 patients (51 men, 131 women) treated with spironolactone alone during a mean follow-up period of 23 months, a mean dose of 96.5 mg decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) by 18 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, below pretherapeutic levels. The BP decrease was greater with doses of 75 to 100 mg (12.4% and 12.2%) than with doses of 25 to 50 mg (5.3 and 6.5%, p less than 0.001), but no additional decrease was found with doses above 150 mg. Plasma creatinine level increased modestly (8.3 mumol/liters), as did plasma potassium level (0.6 mmol/liters) (both p less than 0.001); uric acid level increased, but not significantly (10.5 mumol/liter). Fasting blood glucose and total cholesterol levels did not change, triglyceride levels increased slightly (0.1 mmol/liter, p less than 0.05). These changes were similar in both sexes and were not influenced by length of follow-up. Among the 699 men prescribed spironolactone alone or in association with another antihypertensive treatment, 91 cases of gynecomastia developed (13%). Gynecomastia was reversible and dose-related; at doses of 50 mg or less the incidence was 6.9%, but 52.2% for doses of 150 mg or higher. Despite limitations inherent in the interpretation of data banks, it is concluded that spironolactone administered in daily practice reduced BP without inducing adverse metabolic adverse effects and that in patients with essential hypertension, doses should be kept below 100 mg.\r"

Patients received 180 or 270 mg/day; those with inadequate response were given 270 mg/day plus mefruside, 20 mg/day. Both monotherapy and combination therapy significantly reduced blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise. However, adding mefruside did not significantly decrease BP below that achieved with diltiazem alone. After 14 months of therapy, the percentage of responders (patients with at least 10% reduction in diastolic BP at rest) was 64% for all patients, 100% (by definition) for those receiving diltiazem alone and 47% for those receiving the combination. Diltiazem decreased heart rate by 6% (4 beats/min at rest) (p less than 0.05). Combined therapy with mefruside did not further reduce heart rate. There were few adverse effects and no undesirable metabolic effects with either monotherapy or combined therapy. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone levels, carbohydrate metabolism, serum lipoprotein levels and routine laboratory test results were unchanged in both groups at the end of the study. Thus, diltiazem is an effective antihypertensive agent and apparently the combination of diltiazem and mefruside does not potentiate the antihypertensive effect of diltiazem alone during long-term therapy.\r"

In 10 patients peripheral and central hemodynamic effects of nisoldipine were intraindividually compared with nifedipine using a sequential crossover protocol. The drugs were titrated to a similar steady-state reduction of mean arterial pressure by 15 +/- 3% and 15 +/- 2% and systemic vascular resistance by 25 +/- 5% and 17 +/- 2%, respectively. The equi-effective dosage was 0.17 +/- 0.06 microgram/min/kg for nisoldipine and 0.58 +/- 0.1 microgram/min/kg for nifedipine. In contrast to nifedipine, administration of nisoldipine was associated with increases in cardiac index of 0.45 +/- 0.33 liters/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), stroke volume index of 3.91 +/- 3.0 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05) and left ventricular ejection fraction of 4.6 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.05). Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased with nisoldipine from 11.8 +/- 3.4 to 8.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure from 20.4 +/- 4.06 to 16.1 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005); these variables were unaffected by nifedipine. Thus, intraindividual comparison revealed no cardiodepressive action of nisoldipine, whereas with nifedipine the conceptually beneficial effect of afterload reduction appears to be offset by intrinsic negative inotropic action. Due to higher vasospecificity and more effective unloading, nisoldipine appears to be superior to nifedipine in patients with left ventricular dysfunction secondary to ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "The new inotropic agent milrinone has both vasodilator and inotropic cardiovascular effects, but the importance of these effects in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) is controversial. The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic pressure-diameter relation was used to determine the independent inotropic effect of milrinone. Seven patients with New York Heart Association class III CHF were invasively monitored with right-sided heart catheters and radial arterial lines. M-mode echocardiography was used to measure LV dimensions. The effect of a 10-mg oral dose of milrinone on hemodynamic, echocardiographic and end-systolic variables was determined. End-systolic pressure was measured at the dicrotic notch of the arterial pressure tracing and end-systolic LV dimensions at the time of aortic valve closure. Methoxamine (n = 6) or nitroprusside (n = 1) was used to alter afterload so that the end-systolic pressure-diameter relation could be determined. Arterial vasodilation from milrinone was evidenced by a decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (88 +/- 5 to 77 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.025) and an increase in cardiac index (from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.025), with no change in heart rate (80 +/- 5 beats/min). Milrinone decreased preload as assessed by the pulmonary artery wedge pressure (from 17 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and end-diastolic LV diameter (from 7.4 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.4 cm, p less than 0.025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One technician recorded jet velocities at 1 frame/cycle at a triggered interval after the electrocardiographic R wave and at frame rates of 7.5 and 15 frames/s. Jet areas from 5 consecutive beats were measured by planimetry by 1 observer. Coefficients of variation between and among groups were compared by analysis of variance; mean values were 14 to 22%. Jets grouped less than 2.5, 2.5 to 5 and greater than 5 cm2 showed the variance of small jets exceeding that of medium and large jets. Aortic regurgitant jets were largest and had smaller variance than mitral tricuspid jets. Variability due to atrial fibrillation and the slower frame rate was marginal. Intraobserver error was 4.3% and interobserver 15.4%. Thus, reproducing jet areas carries a minimum variability of 15% or higher, depending on jet size. Valve site could not be excluded as a separate variable. Comparative quantification is best limited to 1 observer.\r"

Patients with severe AR had shorter pressure half-times than those with mild AR (283 +/- 141 vs 820 +/- 393 ms, p less than 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the slope and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and a weaker inverse correlation between pressure half-time and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = -0.59, p less than 0.05). The end-diastolic pressure gradient estimated from CW Doppler using a simplified Bernoulli equation correlated poorly with the catheter measured gradient (r = 0.59, p less than 0.02). The slope of the CW Doppler signal is a better predictor of severity than pressure half-time and is affected by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in addition to angiographic severity of AR.\r"

This procedure was initially reserved for patients who were not considered surgical candidates; it is now regarded by some as an acceptable alternative for valve replacement. To investigate the validity of this postulate, balloon valvuloplasty was performed under direct vision in the operating room in 16 patients just before excision and replacement of their ossified aortic valve. Changes after valvuloplasty were evaluated by inspection as well as by geometric measurements. The authors found that balloon valvuloplasty did not make a detectable impact on valvular anatomy in about two-thirds of the patients and induced enlargement of the functional aortic orifice judged as \"minimal\" or \"moderate\" in one-third of the cases. In no patient was there significant increase in the functional orifice size. Other investigators have shown that hemodynamic and clinical improvement may be induced in some patients by small increases in the aortic orifice; based on the observations herein, such an improvement, if it occurs at all, would be short-lasting; the procedure should be offered only to those who present truly prohibitive risk by standards of modern surgery.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency and significance of mitral anular calcium (MAC) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), 43 clinical and morphologic variables in 200 necropsy cases of HC were examined. Of 100 patients less than 40 years of age, none had MAC. Of the 100 necropsy patients greater than 40 years, 30 (30%) had MAC, 21 (70%) of whom were women. The mean age of the 30 MAC patients was older than that of the 70 non-MAC patients greater than 40 years of age (66 years vs 53 years). The frequency of MAC increased with age. MAC was present in 3 of 31 patients (10%) aged 41 to 50 years; in 6 of 34 patients (18%) aged 51 to 60 years; in 11 of 21 patients (52%) aged 61 to 70 years; and in 10 of 14 patients (71%) aged 71 to 90 years. Compared with the 70 patients greater than 40 years of age without MAC, the 30 patients greater than 40 years of age with MAC had higher average systemic arterial peak systolic pressure (133 mm Hg vs 113 mm Hg); a larger percentage of the MAC patients had calcific deposits in the epicardial coronary arteries (93% vs 41%) and in the aortic valve cusps (33% vs 6%); and a larger percentage of the MAC patients had severe narrowing by atherosclerotic plaques of 1 or more of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries (47% vs 24%). The frequency of a history of systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and total serum cholesterol levels greater than 200 mg/dl in the patients with and without MAC was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To characterize cardiac involvement in idiopathic hemochromatosis, clinical records and 2-dimensional (2-D) echocardiograms of 24 patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis were reviewed. The 17 men and 7 women were 24 to 80 years old (mean 48). Of 19 patients without valvular, ischemic, hypertensive or other known heart disease, 7 (37%) had structural and functional echocardiographic abnormalities attributed to idiopathic hemochromatosis (group 1) and 12 had normal echocardiographic findings (group 2). Age, gender and laboratory markers of iron overload did not differentiate patients with cardiac dysfunction (group 1) from those without cardiac dysfunction (group 2). In group 1, echocardiographic abnormalities included chamber dilatation and global systolic dysfunction. Increased wall thickness was not a feature of idiopathic hemochromatosis. All group 1 patients had abnormal electrocardiographic findings and cardiomegaly on radiography. Despite therapeutic phlebotomy, 4 patients in this group died, between 0.5 and 30 months after echocardiography, because of congestive heart failure. In conclusion, there is a spectrum of cardiac dysfunction in idiopathic hemochromatosis. In patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and left ventricular dysfunction, absolute wall thickness is normal. Survival is poor in patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and severe left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical course was studied in 25 patients with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and aortic regurgitation (AR) who had undergone aortic valvuloplasty and VSD closure. Twelve patients had a doubly committed subarterial VSD and 13 had a perimembranous type of VSD. Preoperatively, progressive hemodynamic disturbance after the onset of AR occurred in 11 patients (44%). The follow-up period extended from 6 months to 23 years (mean 10 years). Four patients required prosthetic valve replacement after valvuloplasty. One of these had had initial improvement of the AR but required valve replacement 20 years later; the condition of the other 3 did not improve initially and their valves were replaced 1 month to 8.5 years later. Four other patients had no initial improvement as a result of valvular reconstructive surgery, but the AR did not progress and remained hemodynamically well tolerated. Hence, the overall success rate of the valvuloplasty, defined as improving or preventing progressive AR, was 21 of 25 (84%). Since initial and long-term improvement in aortic valve function can be expected in most patients after valvuloplasty and closure of the VSD, early surgical intervention is recommended in patients with a VSD and AR.\r"

Concern that direct or amplitude-modulated (AM) recording and playback systems have inherent limitations that cause inaccurate ST-segment recordings has led to preference for frequency-modulated (FM) devices. To determine the accuracy of AM and FM ambulatory electrocardiographic systems, the signal was compared from the same set of 2 bipolar leads simultaneously recorded by standard electrocardiography and AM and FM recorders in 14 patients during treadmill exercise. Also, simultaneous AM and FM recorders were compared in 9 ambulatory patients in 16 monitoring sessions. The AM recording system accurately reproduced ST segments recorded during treadmill exercise (range 4.0 mm of ST-segment depression to 2.0 mm of ST elevation) when measured at the J point (r = 0.91, p less than 0.0001), and 0.08 second after the J point (r = 0.95, p less than 0.0001). FM recording was equally accurate (r = 0.89 and 0.95, respectively, p less than 0.0001). Similarly, during ambulatory recording, the AM technique accurately recorded maximal ST depression in each episode as recorded by the FM device (28 episodes, range 0 to 3 mm of ST depression, r = 0.85, p less than 0.0001). Both AM and FM ambulatory electrocardiographic systems can accurately reproduce ST-segment deviation associated with ischemia and can be used to monitor transient ST-segment changes in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Until the latter half of the twentieth century, beyond a nodding acknowledgment of its massive prevalence, this syndrome received but scant attention from the medical profession. In the early 1960s a number of insights changed perceptions as well as practice. These related to 4 postulates: (1) sudden cardiac death, in the majority of victims, was due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias either initiated by or culminating rapidly in ventricular fibrillation; (2) the lethal arrhythmia was not the consequence of irreversible pathomorphologic impairment of the contractile apparatus, but rather the expression of an electrophysiologic derangement; (3) the triggering of ventricular fibrillation was the result of an electrical accident both reversible as well as preventable; (4) the potential victim was identifiable either by the presence of certain grades of ventricular ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ectopic activity or by exposure of repetitive ventricular arrhythmias by electrophysiologic techniques. The innovations that have led to these insights and their consequences have been numerous and continuous. Among these are direct current defibrillation, cardioversion, coronary care units, bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise stress testing for exposing ventricular arrhythmias, electrophysiologic provocative testing and mapping techniques, overdrive programmable pacemakers as well as implantable defibrillators and cardioverters, and surgical, electrical and laser techniques for ablating the nidus or interrupting the pathways of the arrhythmias.\r"

Each drug was titrated to optimal dosage (dobutamine, 12.5 +/- 3.9 micrograms/kg/min; nitroprusside, 2.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms/kg/min; piroximone 1.4 +/- 0.6 mg/kg) and simultaneous hemodynamic and scintigraphic values were measured. In group 1, the increase in cardiac index was slightly greater with piroximone than with dobutamine (from 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.6 vs 2.4 +/- 0.6 liters/min/m2, p less than 0.025) and only piroximone significantly decreased left ventricular (LV) filling pressure (from 29 +/- 7 to 22 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Both agents increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. In group 2, cardiac index increased similarly with nitroprusside and piroximone (1.5 +/- 0.6 to 2.6 +/- 0.8 and 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.6 +/- 0.5 liters/min/m2, difference not significant), whereas LV filling pressure decreased slightly less with piroximone (29 +/- 7 to 24 +/- 10 vs 30 +/- 7 to 20 +/- 11 mm Hg, difference not significant). Only nitroprusside reduced mean arterial pressure (88 +/- 13 to 72 +/- 12 mm Hg, p less than 0.001 between drugs). In group 1, systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume ratio increased in 9 of 10 patients taking both piroximone and dobutamine, whereas in group 2, this ratio increased in 7 of 8 patients taking piroximone and declined in 7 of 8 taking nitroprusside.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 15 patients with severe congestive heart failure due to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, absolute ventricular volume, ejection fraction and total stroke volume from radionuclide ventriculography were compared with thermodilution stroke volume before and after intensive afterload reduction with vasodilators and diuretics titrated to hemodynamic goals. After 48 to 72 hours, pulmonary artery wedge pressure decreased from 32 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 4 mm Hg and systemic vascular resistance from 1,960 +/- 700 to 1,200 +/- 400 dynes s cm-5. End-diastolic volume decreased from 390 +/- 138 to 301 +/- 126 ml (p less than 0.01) and end-systolic volume from 316 +/- 127 to 241 +/- 111 (p less than 0.01).

Intensive reduction of ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased total ventricular stroke volume by 20% but increased forward stroke volume by 40%. The major effect of intensive afterload reduction for severe congestive heart failure may be the reduction of ventricular volume and mitral regurgitation.\r"

Some patients, however, cannot undergo retrograde catheterization because of atherosclerotic disease, previous vascular surgery or the presence of vessel tortuosity. Because PAV requires the use of large balloon dilating catheters, extreme bleeding and local arterial damage are potential complications. The results of PAV using the anterograde transseptal approach were compared with those using the retrograde arterial approach. Diminution in aortic gradient and increase in aortic valve area were similar in the 2 groups. Vascular complications were more common using the retrograde approach (4 vs 0). Thus, PAV can be performed successfully using anterograde transseptal catheterization. This technique of PAV could be particularly useful in patients who cannot undergo retrograde arterial catheterization.\r"

An intraventricular systolic gradient less than 50 mm Hg, high-quality echocardiograms and cineangiograms and high-fidelity pressure tracings were selection criteria. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were assessed during basal conditions, after 5 minutes of isoproterenol infusion or at angina and ST-segment depression, and 5 and 10 minutes after intravenous propranolol infusion. Isoproterenol increased the intraventricular systolic gradient more significantly in group B than in group A (102.4 +/- 8.3 vs 52.2 +/- 8.2, p less than 0.0001).

In a 5-year period, VSDs occurred in 3.85/1,000 live full-term births and 7.06/1,000 live premature births. The VSD closed spontaneously in 20 of 44 patients (45%) followed from birth (University Hospital group) during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Of 165 patients not followed from birth (referred group), the VSD closed spontaneously in 37 (22%). Overall, VSD location was determined in 101 of 209 patients (48%) and was distributed as follows: membranous 66 (65%), muscular 32 (32%) and subpulmonic 3 (3%). Rates of spontaneous closure for membranous and muscular VSDs were 37% and 50%, respectively, for the University Hospital group and 9% and 9%, respectively, for the referred group (no significant difference in either case). Surgical closure was required in 30 of 165 referred patients (18%) and only 1 of 44 University Hospital patients (2%). There was no significant difference in rate of closure for premature vs full-term infants or small vs larger defects.

Catheter procedures consisted predominantly of vascular dilations (peripheral pulmonic stenosis, 97; valvular pulmonic stenosis, 67; valvular aortic stenosis, 62; recurrent coarctation, 49) and embolizations (double umbrella device, 36; steel coils, 45). Overall, there were 50 acute complications (12%); 24 (6%) were major and 26 (6%) were minor. The mortality rate was 3 of 417 (0.7%). Complication rates varied between 4% for dilation of recurrent coarctation and 40% for dilation of aortic stenosis. The age of the patients was a factor in complications of vascular access (11 patients), 8 of which occurred in patients younger than 6 months (median 5), and in cardiac arrest and ventricular fibrillation (4 patients, 3 of whom were younger than 6 months [median 3]). No statistically significant trend toward diminishing overall complication rates was discerned over the 37 months of this study.\r"

Limited or no information was obtained from cineurograms of 56 patients (33%) because of nonvisualization or poor visualization of 1 or both kidneys. Of the 11 patients (6%) with urinary tract disease, only 3 were correctly assessed by cineurography. Ultrasonography discovered all 11 renal abnormalities and produced only 1 false-positive result. These data indicate that cineurography is a poor screening test and should be abandoned. When uroradiologic screening is necessary for high-risk patients, sonography is recommended.\r"

Two noninvasive methods of diagnosing vena caval obstruction were compared with cardiac catheterization. Echocardiographically gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiographic evaluation (2-dimensional saline contrast echocardiography and pulsed Doppler flow measurement) were performed on 15 patients 0.7 to 13.5 years after intraatrial repair of TGA (8 Mustard, 7 Senning). At catheterization, complete superior vena cava or partial caval obstruction (gradient greater than 5 mm Hg from cava to systemic venous atrium) was present in 7 of 15 patients. Superior vena cava obstruction was directly visualized by MRI in both patients with catheterization-proved complete superior vena cava occlusion. A dilated azygous/hemiazygous venous complex (greater than or equal to 5 mm cross-sectional diameter) was seen by MRI in 5 of 7 patients with complex or partial vena caval obstruction and in no patient without vena caval obstruction. MRI showed superior vena caval dilatation (ratio of superior vena caval diameter to aortic diameter greater than 1.45) in 3 of 5 patients with partial vena caval obstruction and in 0 of 8 without vena caval obstruction. Direct visualization of narrowing within the atrium was unreliable for any MRI plane because of the 3-dimensional nature of the intraatrial baffle. Two-dimensional saline contrast echocardiography, successfully performed in 12 of 15 patients, detected complete superior vena caval obstruction only in the 2 patients with catheterization-proved complete superior vena cava occlusion. Contrast echocardiography failed to identify any of the 5 patients with partial vena caval obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Atrial pacing and programmed atrial extrastimulation were performed before and 5 mn after intravenous administration of verapamil. A significant increase in conduction time and refractory periods was observed at the atrioventricular node level. Dual or accessory atrioventricular pathways, present in 14 cases, appear to have been suppressed in 9. The effect on the sinus node was of particular interest: The corrected sinus node recovery time was strongly prolonged by verapamil in 6 patients, 5 of whom had undergone surgery with extensive atrial reconstruction (Senning 2, anomalous pulmonary venous return 3) and 1 of whom had undergone correction of tetralogy of Fallot. Additional effects of verapamil were the disappearance of a sinus node entrance block in 8 patients and emergence of an ectopic pacemaker in 6. Although verapamil has electrophysiologic properties that should make it a useful drug in the treatment of reentry tachycardia, caution is indicated after extensive atrial surgery because sinus node depression may occur.\r"

Both nisoldipine and the diuretic had a flat dose-response curve. The larger dose of diuretic yielded lower systolic and exercise BP values (erect and supine) than high-dose nisoldipine (p less than 0.05), with less headache (p less than 0.05). In the other 9 patients who did not respond, the combination of nisoldipine 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg)-amiloride (2.5 mg) was administered and yielded a response in 8 patients (overall response including monotherapy 96%). Ten patients were given nisoldipine for an additional period of 6 months, and they required an average dose of 33 mg/day for BP control. In both the 6-week and 6-month studies, nisoldipine monotherapy caused frequent subjective adverse effects.

Triage of patients with chest pain and administration of thrombolytic therapy in ambulances is limited by the lack of specific electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis. A new technique is described using cellular telephone transmission of simultaneous 12-lead ECGs from ambulance to hospital to overcome this limitation. A portable 12-lead ECG installed in an ambulance was connected via modern link to a cellular telephone and digitized ECG information was transmitted to an ECG device in the hospital emergency room. Paramedics in the field placed adhesive patch electrodes and attached ECG wires. Field ECGs from 23 patients were compared with corresponding transmitted ECGs. There were no differences in heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval or R- and T-wave axes. Baseline and transmitted ECGs had identical morphologic characteristics. Differences in R-wave amplitude in 5 transmitted tracings compared with hospital-recorded ECGs resulted in computer diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage, possibly due to differences in patient position. Twelve-lead ECGs can be easily transmitted from a moving ambulance using cellular telephones. This allows diagnosis before hospital arrival, improves prehospital triage of patients and may facilitate prehospital therapy with lidocaine or streptokinase. In addition, the cellular telephone link can convey both verbal and digitized information and thus improve on current telemetry systems.\r"

  ".W": "Diuretics and beta blockers are the mainstay in treating mild and moderate systemic hypertension, but there is controversy as to which should be used first. Recent evidence of an increase in sudden death and a greater number of intolerable side effects in the diuretic-treated groups in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the U.S. and the Medical Research Council Trial in Great Britain has prompted some to suggest beta blockers as first-line therapy. However, beta blockers also have side effects, such as decreased ventricular function in patients with mild heart failure, increased airways resistance in those with chronic obstructive lung disease, increased plasma lipids, in particular low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased problems in patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with diabetes requiring insulin treatment. Many new beta-blocking drugs with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties allow the physician to choose the best one for each patient. beta-blocking drugs with long durations of action, high levels of bioavailability, beta 1 selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity appear most suitable for therapy. Cardioselectivity is suggested for patients with obstructive lung disease and peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic patients who take insulin. Long durations of action permit infrequent administration and recently agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have been shown to have less effects on plasma lipid levels. Acebutolol also reduces ventricular arrhythmias, and may therefore be used to reduce sudden death in patients with coronary artery disease. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of beta-blocking drugs can indicate the most appropriate choice for hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with high blood pressure (BP) can be managed by using one of 4 classes of compounds: a diuretic, beta blocker, converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium antagonist. It is becoming clear, however, that different patients respond to different drugs and that side effects also vary from 1 patient to another. In many patients in whom 1 drug is not sufficient to lower BP, the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs, particularly a diuretic combined with a beta blocker or a converting enzyme inhibitor, is an effective way of decreasing BP further. An understanding of the mechanisms whereby drugs lower BP and why they are additive with some drugs and not with others is clearly important in the more rational use of drugs. The finding that much lower doses of drugs can be used is also important; the combination of a low dose of 2 drugs may not only be more effective in lowering BP but also have less side effects than a higher dose of a single drug. In patients with more resistant hypertension that is not controlled by 1 or 2 drugs combined, the next logical step is to add a third drug. Before doing this, however, it is important to check that the patient is complying with treatment and to consider secondary causes. Ideally, such patients should be referred to someone with a special interest in high BP as they are more likely to have an underlying cause for their hypertension.\r"

Leucine flux increased 31% and leucine oxidation increased 46% after 3 d of fasting compared with leucine flux and oxidation after an overnight fast. Glucose production rate declined 38% and resting metabolic rate decreased 8% during fasting. Plasma concentrations of testosterone, insulin, and triiodothyronine were reduced by fasting whereas plasma glucagon concentrations were increased. We conclude that there is increased proteolysis and oxidation of leucine on short-term fasting even though glucose production and energy expenditure decreased.\r"

Mean weight gain per week (0.4 +/- 0.2 kg) and birth weight (3381 +/- 456 g) were normal. Intakes tended to decline during pregnancy and declined significantly for zinc (p less than 0.05) and vitamin B-6 (p less than 0.03). Mean Zn intake late in pregnancy was low (7.8 +/- 3.3 mg/d). Various supplements were taken but none contained Zn. During pregnancy mean plasma Zn levels fell (p less than 0.001) and late in pregnancy 57% of the women had values suggestive of poor Zn status (less than or equal to 8.1 mumol/L). These data indicate that Zn intakes of approximately 8 mg/d will not maintain plasma Zn levels in late pregnancy. Erythrocyte glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (EGPT) index and the index of diamine oxidase (DAO), a vitamin B-6-requiring enzyme of placental origin, were correlated suggesting that DAO index may be useful in evaluating vitamin B-6 status in pregnancy.\r"

Total cholesterol levels do not vary significantly, but when the differences in HDL cholesterol are accounted for, the means for agriculturalists and active workers are significantly lower than those for sedentary workers who do not play sports. These differences in HDL- and non-HDL-cholesterol levels are consistent with measures of physical activity among the groups. Variation in physical activity due to residence and occupation in Western Samoan men is related to lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but not to total cholesterol levels, and some effects may be secondary to differences in body composition.\r"

Although plasma concentrations of albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin declined with age, these were not related to low intakes of protein by individual elderly people. Similarly, upper-arm muscle mass was not less in those elderly people at the lower end of the range of protein intakes. Thus in this population of overtly healthy elderly men and women, there was no evidence of protein deficiency in contrast to other surveys where elderly people with chronic diseases were included.\r"

Taurine deficiency, which is common in CF, may contribute to the increased breakdown. The occurrence of and the benefit of taurine supplementation to abnormal protein metabolism in apparently optimally treated CF were assessed using a 12-mo double-blind crossover technique in 14 well-nourished and seven mildly-moderately malnourished infection-free preadolescent CF children. Muscle protein breakdown (urinary 3-methylhistidine technique) was significantly decreased in well-nourished (1.35% degraded/24 h +/- 0.15, p less than 0.05) and malnourished (1.24 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001) CF children compared with controls (1.50 +/- 0.17, n = 13). Whole-body protein flux, synthesis, and catabolism ([15N]-glycine technique) were similar in all groups. Net protein gain was greater in CF children, particularly those who were well-nourished (0.55 g/(kg X 10 h) +/- 0.35, p less than 0.01) compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.26). Taurine supplementation did not significantly affect any of the indices. In the absence of infection, protein metabolism in CF children responds appropriately to malnutrition.\r"

Albumin concentrations were associated with BMC when other variables (calcium and protein intake, vitamin D levels, parathyroid hormone, and urinary calcium) also were considered. Thus, alterations in protein metabolism may affect BMC and may play a role in the genesis of senile osteopenia.\r"

Five subjects participated in a supervised program of daily aerobic exercise and three subjects remained sedentary. Total weight loss was not different between exercising and nonexercising subjects but significantly more of the weight loss came from fat and less from fat-free mass in the exercising subjects. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) declined similarly in both groups (approximately 20%), even though exercising subjects were in greater negative energy balance due to the added energy cost of exercise. In summary, results from this controlled inpatient study indicate that exercise is beneficial when coupled with food restriction because it favors loss of body fat and preserves fat-free mass.\r"

Menarche was delayed in the eumenorrheic (13.1 y) and oligomenorrheic (14.3 y) athletic groups compared with the sedentary control subjects (12.2 y) (p less than 0.05). Average bone density tended (p = 0.10) to be lower in the oligomenorrheic athletes (158 mg/mL) compared with the eumenorrheic athletes (184 mg/mL) or sedentary control subjects (173 mg/mL). Dietary fiber intake was significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) in the oligomenorrheic athletes (5.74 g/d) compared with the eumenorrheic athletes (3.62 g/d) or sedentary control subjects (2.97 g/d).

We measured bone density of the spine (L2-4) by dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) two times, 7 mo apart, in 76 healthy postmenopausal women aged 40-70 y. Ca intake was assessed by food-frequency questionnaire. Women with a Ca intake less than 405 mg/d lost spine density at a rate that was significantly greater than that of women with an intake greater than 777 mg/d, p = 0.026. There appears to be a threshold of Ca intake below which increased Ca in the diet is likely to be beneficial in reducing spine mineral loss.\r"

Plasma zinc did not change significantly during Zn depletion but increased slightly when Zn was fed. Zn content of blood cellular components and activities of Zn-containing enzymes were not affected by Zn intake. Ethanol tolerance tests performed at the end of control, middle of depletion, end of depletion, and end of repletion showed a change in ethanol metabolism at the end of the low-Zn intake period that was corrected within 1 mo with Zn supplementation. These data suggest that there are homeostatic mechanisms that maintain circulating levels of Zn. Zn and activity of Zn enzymes in tissues may be decreased before changes in circulating Zn levels are seen. Functional indices of Zn biochemistry, such as ethanol metabolism, may be more sensitive indicators of Zn stores and nutriture than circulating Zn.\r"

Breast-milk Se concentrations fell from 20 micrograms/L (0.25 mumol/L) at 1-mo postpartum to 15 micrograms/L (0.19 mumol/L) at 3- and 6-mo postpartum. A weak (r = 0.38) but statistically significant (p less than 0.025) relationship was observed between maternal plasma Se level and breast-milk Se concentration.

Glucose polymers are widely used as an energy source in enteral nutritional supplements and infant formulas. In this study, eight normal subjects underwent 47Ca absorption tests to compare the effect on calcium absorption of carbohydrate given orally as a simple carbohydrate (glucose) or a more complex carbohydrate (glucose polymers). Oral coadministration of glucose with calcium increased the efficiency of intestinal calcium absorption by 20% and coadministration of glucose with glucose polymers increased calcium absorption by 27%. This suggests that glucose, derived from glucose polymers by hydrolysis, may be responsible for the positive effect of polymers on calcium absorption. The potential positive effect of coadministration of carbohydrate on calcium bioavailability deserves considerations in the design of calcium supplementation strategies.\r"

The most frequent contributing factors to false negative ER-ICAs of FNAs were ER-ICA-low results in histologic biopsies, a prominent stroma component in these tumors, and low cellularity of FNAs.

Yeast, pseudohyphae, or hyphae occurred in 155 specimens (25.7%). Candida was the most frequent opportunistic fungus in immunosuppressed hosts. Patients with clinically significant Candida infection had many budding yeasts and pseudohyphae on cytologic preparations of their lavage fluid. Aspergillus, which occurred in five patients, was readily identified by cytologic examination and by fungal culture. Pneumocystis carinii was found in 14 patients (4%). Cytopathologic characteristics of Herpes simplex or cytomegalovirus were present in four patients (1.2%). In 414 specimens no pathogens were identified by either microbial culture or cytologic examination; usually, these patients had pulmonary hemorrhage, recurrent neoplasia, or therapy-induced lung disease to account for their abnormal chest x-rays. Cytologic and microbiologic examination of lavage fluid readily identified opportunistic pathogens. The ease and low morbidity of bronchoalveolar lavage support its use in the assessment of pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised hosts.\r"

Although relatively simple to perform, it requires venipuncture and laboratory resources for sample handling and analysis. A recently developed capillary whole blood device that uses fingerstick samples was evaluated. Paired capillary whole blood and reference plasma PTs were performed in 858 samples from 732 subjects. The PT for normal volunteers (n = 193) was 11.8 +/- 0.9 seconds with the use of the new instrument and 12.1 +/- 0.5 seconds with the use of the reference method. In samples from 539 patients receiving anticoagulants, the correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.96. Venous whole blood without anticoagulant and capillary whole blood gave equivalent results, which suggests that the fingersticks do not effect the quality of the specimen. Variation in hematocrit between 23.4% (0.34) and 53.8% (0.538) did not alter the performance of the instrument. The new instrument is easy to use and may allow testing by nonlaboratory personnel and patients. It obviates the need for venipuncture, provides immediate results, and appears to be comparable in accuracy to current reference methods.\r"

Although some small (but statistically significant) changes were found in certain tests, in general the FI and percentages of MoAB-positive human PBLs provided information useful in a standardized flow cytometry quality control program.

The authors have addressed this problem by constructing a panel of putatively mutually exclusive antibodies and testing it on sections of anaplastic neoplasms. Tissue sections of 120 routinely processed histologically undifferentiated large cell human neoplasms with a histologic differential diagnosis of carcinoma versus lymphoma and/or melanoma were stained with a panel of antibodies composed of monoclonal antikeratin AE1, monoclonal antileukocyte common antigens PD7/26 and 2B11, and rabbit anti-S-100 protein. Only cases not diagnosable by routine morphologic examination were included. PD7/26 and/or 2B11 were positive in 61 cases (supporting lymphoma), AE1 was positive in 17 cases (supporting carcinoma), and anti-S-100 was positive in 25 cases (supporting melanoma). Seventeen neoplasms failed to react with any of the panel antibodies. None of the neoplasms reacted with antibodies directed against two or more different antigens. These results indicate excellent specificity (100%) and good sensitivity (86%) of the panel antibodies on histologically undifferentiated neoplasms. These results are significant on two levels: first, as a test of the panel approach to evaluate antibodies on anaplastic neoplasms, and, second, as a demonstration of the diagnostic utility of the specific panel the authors have employed in such cases.\r"

These bodies appeared most frequently in large cell carcinomas and in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, particularly of the Clara cell type. In squamous cell carcinomas, they were seen only in nonkeratinizing polygonal tumor cells. Large intracytoplasmic bodies in different pulmonary tumors and Clara cell granules in Clara cell carcinoma showed similar histochemical staining reactions. Electron microscopically, both large intracytoplasmic bodies and Clara cell granules appeared membrane bound and contained electron-dense matrices. The results suggest that large intracytoplasmic bodies in lung carcinoma cells may be a variant of Clara cell granules, only differing in size.\r"

Occasionally, especially in the neonatal period, the AChE activity may not be of diagnostic value. The authors previously reported that simultaneous estimation of butyrylcholinesterase activity (BChE activity) and the determination of AChE/BChE ratio may have discriminatory diagnostic value. They extended this finding to 31 cases of HD, in 16 of which resected tissue was available for study. All cases had histologic confirmation of aganglionosis. The AChE/BChE ratio was found to be higher than 2.0, with the exception of a case in which the biopsy weight was low (i.e., less than 3 mg), even when the AChE activity was normal or borderline. The estimation of AChE/BChE ratio is easy, rapid, and, in the author's experience, of discriminatory diagnostic value.\r"

Although many authors have suggested that the presence of fibrin(ogen) degradation products are in some way responsible for the discrepancies, no direct test of this hypothesis has been carried out. In this report, the authors demonstrate that inhibitors of fibrin monomer polymerization have different effects on the aca and fibrometer assays of fibrinogen. Fibrin polymerization inhibitors allow short soluble fibrin polymers to assemble that can scatter light and are therefore detected by the aca method. However, these short polymers do not gel and thus are not detected by the fibrometer. Therefore, the fibrometer method gives lower fibrinogen values than the aca in the presence of fibrin polymerization inhibitors. The authors also assayed plasma from a patient whose fibrinogen did not polymerize normally and therefore was not measurable by the fibrometer assay. The dysfibrinogenemic plasma assayed by the aca method recorded normal fibrinogen levels. In conclusion, the DuPont aca fibrinogen assay is insensitive to alterations of fibrin polymerization whether from inhibitors or a defective fibrinogen molecule.\r"

Equal weight was assigned to each performance characteristic, and an arbitrarily chosen scoring scale of 100 was selected for simplicity. When a summation procedure was applied to urine studies available in the medical literature, three categories of author acceptability were found: accept: score greater than 80; conditional accept: score 70-80; reject: score less than 70. Studies incorporating leukocyte esterase (LE) were found to have the highest scores and the highest author acceptability, whereas studies lacking LE had the lowest scores and lowest author acceptability. This easy-to-use, weighted scoring system is proposed as a guide for deciding whether dipstick screening tests are acceptable as a way of eliminating routine microscopic examination.\r"

In an attempt to detect early changes of malignancy, we have added the use of flow cytometry to routine endoscopic surveillance procedures. DNA histograms were generated from biopsy samples by utilizing a specific DNA fluorochrome (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and flow cytometry. Sixty-three samples from patients with esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal malignancy were analyzed. An abnormal DNA histogram (aneuploidy) was detected in 79% of esophageal malignancies. In addition, aneuploidy was detected in seven patients with Barrett's esophagus, two of whom had dysplasia. DNA quantification with flow cytometry may be a useful adjunct in screening patients with Barrett's esophagus for early malignant change.\r"

Focal carcinomas were found in 10 hyperplastic polyps, which corresponded to 2.1% of the total of 477 hyperplastic polyps. The location of cancer was at the head or at the surface of the polyp, and was intramucosal. Dysplastic foci equivalent in the degree of histological atypia to adenoma were found adjacent to the cancerous foci in these 10 polyps. Dysplastic foci were also found in 19 hyperplastic polyps without cancerous foci, which corresponded to 4.0% of the total hyperplastic polyps. In connection with the histogenesis of malignant transformation of hyperplastic polyps, the results of clinicopathological examination and immunohistochemical stains strongly suggested that cancer cells arose from the dysplastic area in hyperplastic polyps, rather than directly from nondysplastic hyperplastic epithelium.\r"

A total of 32 procedures to treat stenosing processes in the upper gastrointestinal tract had been performed on the 20 patients admitted to the study. The incidence of bacteremia was found to be 34%. Two patients developed sepsis that required antibiotic treatment, despite which, however, one of the patients died. Routine prophylactic antibiotic administration would, at present, appear to represent overtreatment. However, patients with cardiac diseases or artificial heart valves need antibiotic prophylaxis. Should a fever develop in patients undergoing laser therapy, immediate broad-band antibiotic cover is urgently recommended to prevent septic complications.\r"

In another experiment, 10 patients with duodenal ulcer received acetaminophen (1 g, po) before and after 2 months of cimetidine treatment (400 mg twice a day, po). Acetaminophen metabolism in blood and urine was studied for 9 h in each experiment. The half-life of acetaminophen was similar either in the absence or presence of both acute and chronic cimetidine administration. Although acute cimetidine ingestion did not affect acetaminophen urinary excretion, prolonged cimetidine treatment resulted in a slight but significant decrease of acetaminophen mercapturate urinary excretion. These findings suggest that, unlike acute cimetidine, prolonged histamine H2 antagonist therapy inhibits acetaminophen oxidation to its reactive metabolite. The clinical relevance of such an interaction remains to be explored.\r"

There are two distinct systems of bombesin-like peptide found in rat and human tissue. The neuromedin B family, including neuromedin B and big neuromedin B, is a major bombesin-like peptide in the brain; the neuromedin C gastrin-releasing peptide family is found mainly in the alimentary tract. Neuromedin B is the major and big neuromedin B the minor constituent of central nervous neuromedin B immunoreactivity. Gastrointestinal neuromedin C immunoreactivity is composed chiefly of neuromedin C in rats, and two N-terminally extended forms of neuromedin C including gastrin-releasing peptide in man. It is probable that molecular heterogeneity reflects species variation.\r"

Serial biopsies were taken every 5 cm from the most proximal area reached by the colonoscope down to rectum. The endoscopic and histological extents were evaluated, and the severity of the inflammatory process was graded. Clinical scoring also was performed at the time of both colonoscopies. A change of extent was found in 77% of the patients endoscopically, and in 58% histologically, during a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Extension and regression were demonstrated in the same number of patients. In 61% of 62 procedures, there was complete agreement between colonoscopic and histological extents. The histological extent exceeded the colonoscopic extent in 28% of the procedures. We have the impression that change in the disease extent is a frequent event, and may be a part of the natural history of ulcerative colitis, rather than the exception.\r"

Portal and superior mesenteric venous flows increased significantly throughout the experiment, whereas no significant change occurred in splenic venous flow after the meal in all three groups. The extent of the increase in portal venous flow was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis, compared with normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis, whereas superior mesenteric venous flow increased to the same extent in all three groups. The sum of superior mesenteric and splenic venous flows was less than the estimated portal venous flow in both normal subjects and patients with chronic active hepatitis; however, this value was greater than the portal venous flow in patients with cirrhosis. The difference widened during postprandial mesenteric hyperemia, indicating an increase of blood flow into the portal-systemic shunts. In conclusion 1) postprandial hyperemia occurs in the intestine, but not in the spleen, to the same extent in patients with chronic active hepatitis or with cirrhosis, as in normal subjects, and 2) a considerable amount of postprandial mesenteric hyperemia bypasses the liver into the systemic circulation of patients with cirrhosis but not in patients with chronic active hepatitis and normal subjects.\r"

Intrahepatic pressure was significantly elevated in the group order of chronic active hepatitis without bridging necrosis (n = 17, 9.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg), chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis (n = 24, 12.3 +/- 5.7), and posthepatitic liver cirrhosis (n = 65, 18.8 +/- 4.2), compared with controls (n = 13, 6.8 +/- 2.7), whereas it was not elevated in the group of idiopathic portal hypertension (n = 9, 7.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg), acute hepatitis (n = 10, 8.4 +/- 2.6 mm Hg), and chronic persistent hepatitis (n = 23, 7.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), compared with controls. As complications, four patients had abdominal discomfort continuing for more than a day; however, patients were allowed to walk after they had rested on their beds for 30 min. In 37 patients (27 with cirrhosis, seven idiopathic portal hypertension, and three others), portal vein and/or hepatic vein catheterization was performed during the same procedure of intrahepatic pressure measurement. Intrahepatic pressure showed significant correlations with corrected wedged hepatic vein pressure (r = 0.91), portohepatic gradient (r = 0.69), wedged hepatic vein pressure (r = 0.79), and portal vein pressure (r = 0.68). Slopes were 0.97, 0.83, 0.66, and 0.65, respectively. In conclusion, intrahepatic pressure reflects hepatic sinusoidal pressure (corrected wedged hepatic vein pressure), and intrahepatic pressure starts to elevate at the stage of chronic active hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "While the use of magnesium-containing compounds is usually contraindicated in dialysis patients, the risk of toxicity from hypermagnesemia can be reduced by lowering the magnesium concentration in dialysate. We examined the effects of a magnesium-free dialysate on both serum magnesium level and the peritoneal removal rate of magnesium over 12 weeks in 25 stable patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). After 2 weeks, the serum magnesium level decreased from 2.2 to 1.9 mg/dL (0.9 to 0.8 mmol/L) (P less than .02) and the peritoneal removal rate increased from 66 to 83 mg/d (2.8 to 3.5 mmol/d) (P less than .05), with both values remaining stable thereafter. There was a strong association between these parameters (r = -0.62, P less than .05), suggesting that the serum magnesium level decreased as a result of the initial increased peritoneal removal rate. For an additional 4-week period, a subgroup of nine patients received magnesium-containing, phosphate binding agents instead of those containing only aluminum. During this phase, serum inorganic phosphorus was well controlled. The serum magnesium level increased only from 1.8 to 2.5 mg/dL (0.7 to 1.0 mmol/L) (P less than .05), due in great part to the concomitant 41% rise in peritoneal magnesium removal from 91 to 128 mg/d (3.8 to 5.3 mmol/d) (P less than .05). No toxicity was noted during the entire 16-week study period, nor did serum calcium change.

Seventeen percent of peritonitis episodes were associated temporally and by microbiologic results with exit site or tunnel infections. Twenty-one percent of exit site and tunnel infections and 20% of peritonitis episodes resulted in catheter loss. Peritonitis due to Staphylococcus aureus was more likely to be associated with an exit site or tunnel infection and was more likely to result in loss of the catheter than peritonitis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis. Peritonitis and exit site infections due to Pseudomonas sp also frequently resulted in catheter removal. We found that exit site infections cause significant morbidity in CAPD patients. Further studies in this area are needed.\r"

  ".U": "88021011\r", 
  ".W": "Past measurements of somatomedins in chronic renal failure have yielded conflicting results because compounds that accumulate in renal failure and interfere with the somatomedin assays were not removed from assay systems. After serum somatomedins were separated from inhibitory substances by acid chromatography, we measured levels of the major somatomedins, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF-2, in 16 prepubertal children with chronic renal insufficiency and in 16 age- and sex-matched normal children. Radioimmunoassayable IGF-1 levels were 220 +/- 182 (mean +/- SD) ng/mL in children with renal disease, not significantly different from levels of 248 +/- 155 ng/mL found in normal children. Levels of the less potent mitogen IGF-2, measured by radioreceptor assay, were 661 +/- 213 ng/mL in children with renal disease and were significantly greater than those of 433 +/- 139 ng/mL found in normal children (P less than .05). Since all 16 children with renal disease exhibited significant growth delay, we conclude that low serum IGF levels are unlikely to play a role in this growth failure. Further, since unsaturated somatomedin carrier proteins can interfere with the assay and in vitro biologic actions of the IGFs, and since there was more unsaturated carrier protein binding of IGF-1 by the sera of 15 children with renal disease v 15 normal children (17 +/- 3% v 12 +/- 3% binding of [125I]-IGF-1/50 muL serum, P less than .05), we suggest that somatomedin carrier proteins should be evaluated for their role in the growth failure of children with chronic renal failure.\r"

In 150 unselected hemodialysis patients, 62 (41%) had ferritin levels greater than 2,000 ng/mL (normal = 10 to 360 ng/mL). In 16 of these patients, accurate transfusion histories were obtained and ferritin levels correlated with calculated transfusional iron burden (r = 0.553, P less than .05). These patients could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their response to a single dose (2 g, IV) of deferoxamine: \"high\" responders had twice the level of feroxamine (the chelated product of deferoxamine and iron) of the \"low\" responders (P less than .001). High responders also had significantly higher prevalence of the \"hemochromatosis\" alleles A3, B7, and B14 than a large group of dialysis patients awaiting transplantation (71% v 37%, P less than .001). In two patients with iron overload and clinically significant bone disease, bone histology revealed prominent iron staining at the calcification front. We conclude that transfusional iron overload is a significant clinical problem in long-term hemodialysis patients, that may also be associated with bone pathology.\r"

Such a trait, although genetically controlled, does not usually run in families, since the specific gene combination can hardly be preserved in the process of reproduction. The present paper suggests a concrete genetical model to account for the phenomenon that there is little resemblance between siblings and parent-child pairs with respect to this trait. The genetical model is multiple homozygosis for all loci involved in the gene configuration. The properties of such a trait in a random mating population for all families, as well as for the segregating families only, are investigated. Some of the difficulties in estimating the genetical parameters on the basis of empirical data are also discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Cases of infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) with high residual hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity have recently been described. The clinical presentation of the disease in these patients is identical to that found among Ashkenazi-Jewish patients. Fibroblasts from two such TSD patients had Hex A activity comprising 16% of total Hex when measured by thermal fractionation and quantitation with 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (4MUG). Hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine-6-SO4 (4MUGS) by patient fibroblast extracts is catalyzed by an enzyme activity that comprises less than 1% of total Hex. Kinetic analysis of patient Hex A by using 4MUGS revealed Km's similar to that of control Hex A but Vmax's significantly different from that of the control enzyme. The inhibitors N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4 were used to distinguish between active sites associated with the two different subunits of Hex A. A beta-subunit site with little activity toward 4MUGS is sensitive to N-acetylglucosamine but resistant to N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4. This site accounts for most of the hydrolysis of 4MUG. By contrast, an alpha-subunit site that is sensitive to N-acetylglucosamine-6-PO4 but resistant to N-acetylglucosamine accounts for almost all of the hydrolysis of 4MUGS. In mutant cells, this site retains the ability to bind substrate but is deficient in catalytic activity toward 4MUGS. The pH optima of patients' Hex A is shifted to a more acidic range, and the enzymes are significantly more thermostable than control Hex A. By using the thermal fractionation procedure for serum isozyme discrimination, one parent of each patient is unambiguously classified as heterozygous for the TSD gene whereas the other parent has test values in the grey zone. When parents are tested by use of 4MUGS, however, all four parents are classified as heterozygotes. Comparison of the results of both assay procedures allows the carrier of the atypical TSD allele to be recognized and identifies the probands as compound heterozygotes.\r"

First, hybridization to Southern transfers revealed the presence in this XXX male of sequences derived from the Y-chromosomal short arm. Second, in situ hybridization showed that this Y DNA was located on the tip of the X-chromosomal short arm. We conclude that this XXX male resulted from the coincidence of X-X nondisjunction during maternal meiosis and aberrant X-Y interchange either during or prior to paternal meiosis.\r"

However, charge differences that persist in HPX isoproteins following neuraminidase treatment suggest the presence of genetically determined HPX variation, and this is confirmed by population and family studies. HPX was found to be monomorphic, with an invariant pattern, in U.S. whites; but it is polymorphic in U.S. blacks, with three alleles controlled by a single locus, a situation that demonstrates an autosomal codominant pattern of inheritance. The HPX 1, HPX 2, and HPX 3 allele frequencies in U.S. blacks are .941, .018, and .041, respectively.\r"

To determine if clinical, anatomic, or electrophysiologic variables and prognosis are significantly different in elderly subjects, 49 elderly (68 to 84 years) and 44 younger (44 to 53 years) survivors of refractory symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation secondary to coronary artery disease were studied. Elderly patients displayed more extensive anatomic coronary artery disease, with 80 percent having three-vessel disease in comparison with 30 percent of the younger patients (p less than 0.001). Prior myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiomegaly were more common in the elderly group (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.034, respectively), whereas angina was more common in the younger group (p less than 0.001). In 55 percent of the elderly patients and 58 percent of the younger patients, electrophysiologic testing demonstrated inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia that required treatment with an investigative antiarrhythmic drug and/or cardiac surgery, including implantation of an automatic defibrillator. Elderly patients tolerated aggressive evaluation as well as did younger patients, and despite the difference in clinical and anatomic findings, long-term survival curves were similar, although the probability of survival at 20 months was 62 percent in the elderly and 80 percent in the younger patients. This difference in early survival is explained by eight surgical deaths in the elderly group, compared with two in the younger group.\r"

To further study this question, 89 patients hospitalized at the Denver Veterans Administration Medical Center with pneumococcal bacteremia were chosen as the case group for a case-control study. The control group was made up of patients matched on the basis of age, date of admission, and comorbid conditions. Vaccination status in the bacteremic patients and control patients was determined, as were pneumococcal serotypes among the bacteremic patients. If the vaccine were protective, vaccination rates should be higher among the control patients, and serotype distribution should be different in vaccinated and nonvaccinated bacteremic patients. There were no differences between vaccination rates among bacteremic patients (29 percent) and control patients (24 percent). Furthermore, 65 percent of the blood isolates from nonvaccinated bacteremic patients were serotypes included in the vaccine, as compared with 69 percent of the isolates in vaccinated bacteremic patients. Pneumococcal vaccine did not appear to be protective in this high-risk population.\r"

Thirty-seven patients received plasma therapy and 30 survived. In 12 patients (37 percent of survivors), relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura developed, manifested by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and less frequently by neurological or renal abnormalities. Six patients had a second relapse, and two had five relapses. To assess the severity of the disease, a scoring system was designed based on the four major manifestations of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura listed above. The patients who died had a significantly higher score than those who survived. The initial episodes and the relapses of patients with relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were milder than those in patients who only had a single episode and survived. Two relapses, however, were fatal, demonstrating that relapsing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not a benign disorder. Infections, pregnancy and surgery were frequently associated with the initial episodes and the relapses. Hence, patients who recover from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be alerted to the possibility of relapse in association with these conditions.\r"

Among 58 consecutive patients monitored during first remission, central nervous system leukemia developed in nine (16 percent). Four patients, including one who was symptomatic, had central nervous system leukemia detected simultaneously with marrow relapse. Five additional patients were asymptomatic and continue to have bone marrow remission. Following central nervous system and systemic treatment, two of these five patients have never had relapse, and three had relapse in the bone marrow five, 10, and 21 months later. Factors at diagnosis associated with the subsequent development of central nervous system leukemia were elevated leukocyte count, serum lysozyme and lactate dehydrogenase, extramedullary infiltration including splenomegaly, and monocytic (FAB M4 or M5a) morphology. In six of 17 patients (35 percent) with monocytic morphology, central nervous system leukemia developed compared with only three of 41 patients (7 percent) with other subtypes (p = 0.02). Discriminant analysis identified leukocyte count, splenomegaly, and M4 or M5a morphology as the most important risk factors and led to a mathematical formula that correctly identified 90 percent of the patients. Although the risk of central nervous system leukemia in adults with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia is too low to justify routine prophylaxis, those patients recognized to be at a greater risk should receive prophylaxis or be monitored closely with periodic lumbar punctures.\r"

The study groups included more patients with \"advanced\" disease and fewer with \"early\" disease than in the general population because these patients were referred to radiotherapy cancer centers, sometimes routinely, but often because referring physicians believed that certain clinical features indicated the need for additional treatment. Although this report is subject to all the problems of retrospective studies, a careful assessment of the pretreatment extent of disease combined with a long follow-up period has allowed an analysis of prognostic factors with considerable confidence. Univariate analysis of 12 possible prognostic factors (excluding treatment) demonstrated that nine of them were of statistical significance: postoperative status, age at diagnosis, extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, nodal involvement, differentiation, sex, tumor size, and pathologic type (in descending order of importance). Multivariate analysis was carried out using cause-specific survival rates. Independently important prognostic factors at initial treatment were age at diagnosis, extrathyroidal invasion, and degree of differentiation histologically for papillary cancers; and extrathyroidal invasion, distant metastases, primary tumor size, nodal involvement, age at diagnosis, and postoperative status for follicular cancers. The prognostic factors for tumor recurrence were quite different for the papillary and follicular cancers and ranked differently for the two groups.\r"

Some proponents of the procedure, however, believe that fine needle aspiration should be restricted to centers in which each operator obtains at least 500 biopsy specimens annually. Reviewed were 155 biopsy specimens obtained over three and one-half years, and the sensitivity of fine needle aspiration was determined to be 100 percent, the specificity to be 47.4 percent, and the accuracy to be 73 percent. A review of the literature revealed the sensitivity in larger series to range between 92 and 98 percent, specificity to range between 52 and 99.5 percent, and accuracy to range between 56.1 and 91.3 percent. The surgical yield of carcinoma was 64 percent in patients evaluated with fine needle aspiration, whereas the yield was 26 percent in those who underwent surgery without fine needle aspiration. These results appear to justify the use of fine needle aspiration in the evaluation of nodular thyroid disease at average-sized health care centers.\r"

  ".W": "Raynaud's phenomenon without an underlying cause was diagnosed in 96 consecutive patients in 1978 to 1979. Seventy-three patients were available for long-term follow-up. They were classified on initial evaluation as having primary Raynaud's phenomenon (49 patients) when no clinical, laboratory, or serologic abnormality was detected, and as having suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon when at least one finding was abnormal. Re-evaluation was performed in 1984 to 1985 after an average duration of Raynaud's phenomenon of 14.9 +/- 12 years. The average duration of the follow-up from initial to final evaluation was 4.7 +/- 1 years. On final evaluation, none of the 49 patients with an initial diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon had evidence of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas 14 of the 24 patients with suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon had a definite diagnosis. Among them, there were 13 connective tissue diseases. The study proved that Raynaud's phenomenon without an underlying cause must be followed up for more than two years, contrary to what was recommended previously, before it can be rightly diagnosed as primary Raynaud's phenomenon. Moreover, the results suggested that, in order to distinguish early primary Raynaud's phenomenon from suspected secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, a simple and noninvasive evaluation is sufficient. In this study, the evaluation included history and clinical examination, tests for antinuclear antibodies, radiography of hands, chest roentgenography, and nailfold capillary microscopy.\r"

  ".W": "The increased incidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be due to a dyslipoproteinemia caused by corticosteroid administration. To determine whether lipoprotein lipid levels are abnormal in SLE and the relation of lipoprotein levels to corticosteroid use, lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured in 46 female patients with SLE and 30 matched control subjects. The patients with SLE had higher levels of plasma triglyceride (134 versus 73 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), cholesterol (201 versus 168 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (121 versus 94 mg/dl; p less than 0.001) than control subjects. The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein subfraction 3 cholesterol, and apolipoprotein Al were similar in the two groups, but high-density lipoprotein subfraction 2 cholesterol was lower in the patients with SLE (10.2 versus 18.2 mg/dl; p less than 0.001). When patients with SLE treated with prednisone (n = 32) were compared to patients with SLE not treated with prednisone (n = 14), the former had higher triglyceride (158 versus 87 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), cholesterol (214 versus 170 mg/dl; p less than 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 versus 103 mg/dl; p less than 0.001) levels. The patients with SLE not treated with prednisone had lipid levels similar to those in control subjects except that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower (49.7 versus 59.0 mg/dl; p less than 0.05). The daily prednisone dosage in the treated patients with SLE correlated with levels of cholesterol (r = 0.38, p less than 0.02), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.40, p less than 0.02), and high-density lipoprotein subfraction 3 cholesterol (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01). Thus, female patients with SLE have a dyslipoproteinemia of the type that would place them at an increased risk for coronary artery disease. Corticosteroids, used in the treatment of SLE, seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of the observed lipoprotein abnormalities.\r"

Of the 67 trials surveyed, 66 (99 percent) performed multiple comparisons with a mean of 30 therapeutic comparisons per trial.

Although some statistical techniques are available, there still exists a great need for future work to clarify further the problem of multiple comparisons and determine how the impact of this problem can best be minimized in subsequent research.\r"

One hour later, 100 ml of 40 percent ethanol was sprayed directly on the gastric mucosa of the greater curvature during an endoscopic examination. Gastric mucosal changes were assessed by endoscopic appearance (according to grading scale) and by histology. In placebo-pretreated subjects, alcohol produced prominent mucosal damage (endoscopic score, 3.9 +/- 0.3, histologic score, 4.0 +/- 1.1 at 30 minutes). Cimetidine alkalinized gastric pH but did not prevent alcohol-induced damage (endoscopic score, 4.0 +/- 0.6; histologic score, 3.8 +/- 1.1, at 30 minutes). Sucralfate reduced endoscopic and histologic features of alcohol injury (endoscopic score, 1.8 +/- 0.6; histologic score, 1.8 +/- 1.1, at 30 minutes) without affecting gastric luminal pH. Reduction of alcohol-induced injury of the human gastric mucosa by sucralfate but not cimetidine demonstrates that effective protection of the gastric mucosa can be achieved without neutralization or inhibition of gastric acid secretion and points out another clinical application for sucralfate.\r"

Histamine (H2)-receptor blockers are currently considered the standard therapy. The goal of this study was to compare the potential efficacy of sucralfate with that of cimetidine. A single-blind, randomized, multicenter study was performed in 42 patients with endoscopically documented reflux esophagitis. Patients were randomly given 1 g of sucralfate suspension four times daily or 400 mg of cimetidine four times daily for eight weeks. Forty patients were evaluated after eight weeks. Symptomatic improvement was good and comparable in both groups. In two patients given sucralfate and one given cimetidine, side effects were noted but did not necessitate withdrawal from the study. Endoscopy showed improvement in 53 percent of patients and healing of esophagitis in 31 percent after sucralfate treatment. With cimetidine, improvement was seen in 67 percent and healing occurred in 14 percent. In one patient receiving cimetidine, distal esophageal stenosis developed, requiring dilatation therapy. It is concluded that treatment with sucralfate improves the symptomatology and severity of reflux esophagitis. The results obtained with sucralfate appear comparable to those with cimetidine. Sucralfate may therefore be considered as a valid alternative to H2-receptor antagonist therapy in treating reflux esophagitis.\r"

Liquid sucralfate given prior to acid infusion consistently prevented acid-induced lesions, demonstrated by quantitative histologic scoring.

  ".W": "Sucralfate has been reported to protect the gastroduodenal mucosa against a variety of agents and is known to adsorb bile salts. Since gastrointestinal side effects can seriously compromise the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and since it seems reasonable to assume that sucralfate may adsorb nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the influence of sucralfate on the pharmacokinetic parameters of naproxen was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers. To do so, the pharmacokinetic profile of naproxen, administered alone or with sucralfate, singly or repeatedly (twice daily for five days), was compared. No significant difference was observed with any pharmacokinetic parameter between the single administration of naproxen alone or with sucralfate. However, a significantly lower maximum plasma concentration was attained with the repeated administration of naproxen in combination with sucralfate, compared with the repeated administration of naproxen alone. When single- and multiple-dose administration were compared, significant differences were observed in the maximum plasma concentration and the cumulative area under the curve. These results suggest an accumulation of naproxen after five days' administration. This accumulation, however, is not altered by the administration of sucralfate. The results of this study suggest that when naproxen is administered with sucralfate, only a delay in naproxen's absorption may occur, confirmed by a lower maximum plasma concentration, a longer time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, a similar elimination half-life, and equivalence in bioavailability. The clinical importance of such a delay has yet to be proved; however, it is unlikely that the clinical efficacy of naproxen will be altered, since the amount of drug absorbed remains the same.\r"

  ".W": "Sucralfate, an agent that heals peptic ulcers in humans, has been shown to reduce aspirin-induced gastric mucosal damage in experimental animals. It has been suggested that the protective effect of sucralfate is due to stimulation of local prostaglandin production. The purpose of this study was to establish whether sucralfate was capable of reducing aspirin-induced gastric damage in humans. The effect of 1 g of sucralfate or identical placebo was studied in random order in eight healthy subjects. To determine if the effect of sucralfate was related to local prostaglandin synthesis, a second series of studies was performed in which prostaglandin production was inhibited with indomethacin 50 mg given orally eight hours before sucralfate. In each subject, all studies were performed at least one week apart. Following an overnight fast, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, with sucralfate or placebo given orally 30 minutes before ingestion of 1,200 mg of soluble aspirin in 50 ml of water. Both endoscopist and subject were unaware of the test agent. Ninety minutes after aspirin ingestion, endoscopy was again performed and gastric mucosal lesions were counted and graded to derive an erosion score. Results are expressed as mean +/- SEM. Aspirin produced endoscopic changes (score of 2.75 +/- 0.49) that were significantly (p less than 0.05) inhibited by sucralfate (score of 1.13 +/- 0.44). The protective effect of sucralfate was abolished by pretreatment with indomethacin (scores of 2.88 +/- 0.55 and 1.88 +/- 0.40, respectively). These results demonstrate that sucralfate significantly protects the human gastric mucosa against the acute damaging effects of aspirin. This effect is abolished by indomethacin, suggesting that the protective action of sucralfate on the gastric mucosa of humans may be related to stimulation of endogenous prostaglandins.\r"

Patients were assessed endoscopically at four, eight, and 12 months after healing or earlier if clinical relapse occurred. Of the original 59 patients, 53 showed healing with six weeks of therapy, and the remaining six patients required 10 weeks of treatment. Nine patients were subsequently lost to follow-up because of non-compliance, leaving 50 patients for the analysis, 24 who received sucralfate and 26 who received placebo. There were 10 ulcer recurrences in the sucralfate group and the ulcers in 14 (58 percent) patients remaining healed at the end of 12 months. In contrast, there were 21 recurrences in the placebo group with the ulcers in five patients (19 percent) remaining healed at 12 months. Patients who received placebo experienced recurrence more quickly than those who received sucralfate and there was no difference between the two groups in terms of symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrence. There was no alteration in serum aluminium and phosphate levels throughout the study. Smoking seemed to have no adverse effect on recurrence once initial healing had been achieved. Sucralfate is, therefore, an effective and safe maintenance treatment for duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

In chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep, we measured the ability of lung lymph to aggregate normal sheep neutrophils in vitro. We found a marked increase in lung lymph aggregating activity beginning within 1 hour after endotoxin infusion and persisting for several hours. When n-acetylcysteine was administered to the animals before endotoxin infusion, neutrophil aggregating activity in lung lymph after endotoxin infusion was markedly reduced. N-acetylcysteine did not affect neutrophil aggregation, adherence, or leukotriene B4 production in vitro and did not prevent complement activation at concentrations achieved in vivo. It is concluded that endotoxemia causes release from the lungs of substance(s) that activate granulocytes, and that this response is prevented by n-acetylcysteine, possibly as a result of the antioxidant properties of the drug.\r"

The patient who was not affected had less effects on urinary PGE2 and TxB2 and no effect on 6-keto PGF1 alpha. In this patient, dosing with ibuprofen caused pronounced declines in all urinary prostanoids and a decrease in creatinine clearance. Two other patients treated with ibuprofen and one treated with naproxen also suffered decrements in all parameters. In conclusion, sulindac had suppressant effects on renal prostanoids associated with declines in creatinine clearance in these patients with cirrhosis, indicating a need for similar cautions with its use as with other NSAIDs.\r"

However, significantly (p greater than 0.01) less soluble radioactive material was released into the media from dishes containing SMC incubated with OC serum, indicating that their capacity to degrade LDL was impaired. Increased amounts of both cholesterol and cholesterol ester and electron microscopic evidence of lipid accumulation were found in SMC grown for 12 days under standard culture conditions with 10% OC serum. This combination of in vitro findings suggests that OC use may accelerate the development of cardiovascular disease in some women by modifying the metabolism of LDL by cells of the arterial wall.\r"

When the cardiac work:KC ratio, defined as LVSWI divided by KC activity, was plotted against LVSWI, the correlation coefficient was 0.86. Cardiac work did not correlate with other metabolic pathways measured. Patients with a reduced LVSWI generated less cardiac work per unit of KC activity than those who had a normal or elevated LVSWI. These data indicate that a reduction in LVSWI below 40 gram-meters/square meter (gm-m/m2) may be associated with either inefficient energy production, inefficient energy utilization, or both.\r"

PMN from pain-free patients had normal chemotaxis, whereas patients in vaso-occlusive crisis had a significant impairment in PMN chemotaxis. PMN chemotaxis was inversely related to the PMN aggregation response to FMLP with CB (r = -0.75). Thus, the PMN from pain-free patients with SCD appears to have normal or decreased \"stickiness\" and to develop increased stickiness during vaso-occlusive crisis. The mechanisms responsible for these changes need further elucidation. Alterations in PMN function may be responsible, in part, for the increased risk of infection noted in individuals with SCD and may play a role in the development of the acute chest syndrome.\r"

The scleroderma renal crisis caused terminal renal failure, which was treated by chronic hemodialysis. This is the second reported case of thymoma associated with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). The authors suggest that thymoma and various immunologic disorders have a common etiologic factor which has not yet been found. This case emphasizes that thymectomy frequently has little effect on the course of the immunologic disease. The implications of the association of thymoma and PSS are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Congenital nystagmus may occur in a manifest or latent form. Since most patients with latent nystagmus also have nystagmus with both eyes open (manifest latent nystagmus), differentiation between these two entities frequently requires electronystagmographic wave form analysis. Such analysis shows distinctive characteristics for manifest and latent or manifest latent congenital nystagmus, suggesting different origins. Several compensation mechanisms exist by which congenital nystagmus is decreased and visual acuity improved. For manifest nystagmus, these mechanisms include version or convergence innervation or a rest point between primary position and maximal lateroversion. In latent or manifest latent nystagmus, the nystagmus decreases when the fixating eye is adducted. Patients with manifest congenital nystagmus may use several of these compensation strategies. Because of the difficulties involved in distinguishing between manifest and manifest latent nystagmus without electronystagmography, confusion has arisen regarding the etiologic relationship between congenital nystagmus and infantile esotropia. Such relationship clearly exists in some patients with manifest nystagmus and convergence dampening. However, in most patients with infantile esotropia and congenital nystagmus, the nystagmus is latent or manifest latent and there is no evidence of a causal relationship between these two entities.\r"

Based on the presence of subcortical lesions, patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy do not appear to have an increased incidence of generalized cerebral vascular disease.\r"

Investigation of the intermediate filament composition of tubular epithelia in diseased rat and human kidneys now shows that altered tubular epithelia unequivocally coexpress keratin and vimentin. In rats, pronounced coexpression of vimentin and keratin was observed in chronic nephrosis induced by daunomycin, and the extent of coexpression seemed to increase with the incidence of altered collapsed and cystically dilated tubules and with the degree of tubular epithelial proliferation. It was also seen during tubular regeneration after acute tubulotoxic injury induced by mercury chloride poisoning, with vimentin expression being lost in fully regenerated tubular epithelium. In man, expression was seen in chronically and irreversibly damaged kidneys. Thus, vimentin can be expressed temporarily in acutely and reversibly damaged kidneys and chronically in irreversibly damaged kidneys. Vimentin could perhaps be regarded as an indicator of the regenerating and proliferating activity of tubular lesions.\r"

After obtaining control data, hearts were potassium-arrested, made ischemic, and studied at various time points. Regional coronary flow was assessed with the use of radiolabeled microspheres or Microfil dye infusion, and morphologic changes were evaluated by means of light and electron microscopy. Sarcomere length changes and qualitative morphologic changes during global ischemia demonstrate a transmural progression of ischemic damage starting at the endocardium and extending, with time, epicardially. The progression of ischemic changes in hypertrophied hearts of SHRs was similar to that of normal hearts; however, hypertrophied hearts developed ischemic contracture sooner than normal hearts. In addition, the development of contraction band change after ischemic contracture occurred only when hearts were reperfused and was related to the development of no-reflow.\r"

  ".W": "Connective tissue-type mast cells, other than those located in the serosal cavity, are fixed in the tissues. For study of the differentiation processes of mast cells in connective tissue, an in vitro method for producing mast-cell colonies is required. The authors enzymatically dispersed the cells from the skin of either neonatal or adult mice and plated them in methylcellulose containing pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium (PWM-SCM). More than 97% of the colonies that developed consisted of mast cells alone. The clonal nature of the mast-cell colonies was determined by using the giant granules of C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ mice as a marker: even when a mixture of skin cells from C57BL/6-bgJ/bgJ and C57BL/6-+/+ mice was plated, most of the resulting colonies consisted of either bgJ/bgJ-type mast cells alone or +/+-type mast cells alone. In spite of depletion of T-cell-derived factors, concentrations of mast cells and mast cell colony-forming units (CFU-Mast) in the skin of nude athymic mice are normal. However, PWM-SCM was necessary for in vitro development of mast-cell colonies from the skin of nude mice. The concentration of CFU-Mast in the skin of genetically mast-cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice was negligible when compared with the value observed in the skin of control WBB6F1-+/+ mice. Individual mast-cell colonies derived from the skin of neonatal WBB6F1-+/+ mice were lifted from the methylcellulose, and cells from each colony were injected into the wall of the glandular stomach and the skin of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice. Most of the mast cell that appeared at the skin injection sites of the WBB6F1-W/Wv mice stained with berberine sulfate, indicating that they contained heparin. In contrast, the mast cells that appeared in the stomach mucosa of the recipient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice did not stain. This suggests that CFU-Mast located in the skin have not been committed to the connective tissue type. The present method may be useful for investigation of the mechanisms of mast-cell differentiation in connective tissue other than the serosal cavity.\r"

This developmental profile is similar to that of certain oncofetal gene products such as alpha-fetoprotein, which is used as a tumor marker. This study deals with the reexpression of MT genes in thyroid tumors. With an immunohistochemical method, the presence of MT was investigated in tissue sections of normal and neoplastic human thyroid glands. Tissue sections of 34 thyroid tumors and 10 normal human thyroid glands were studied by means of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. MT was localized in 31 of the thyroid gland tumors. MT was also present in two of the normal thyroid glands. These findings indicate that although high levels of MT are mainly found in the fetal liver, it may also be expressed actively in certain human thyroid neoplastic tissues, and occasionally in normal thyroid tissue.\r"

Here they report the outcome of injecting recombinant human TNF/cachectin into normal mice and others with low parasitemias (6-35%) of Plasmodium vinckei. The object was to see how precisely the pathologic features of the terminal stages of this infection could be produced, when parasitemias are 70-80%. Hypoglycemia, mid-zonal liver damage, and pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils in the pulmonary vasculature, all of which are seen in severe P vinckei infection, occurred within 4-12 hours after the mildly infected mice received TNF/cachectin. Uninfected mice were much less susceptible. TNF/cachectin also increases plasma lactate, a change seen in both the human and rodent diseases. From these findings and the recent literature on TNF/cachectin, including its detection in serum from malarial patients, it seems likely that excessive release of this monokine could account for certain of the unexplained pathologic features of human malaria.\r"

  ".W": "Type II alveolar epithelial cells in long-term culture typically lose the ability to synthesize surfactant together with a loss of the characteristic lamellar bodies in the cytoplasm of the cells. Iprindole, a cationic amphiphilic drug, induces lamellar body formation in cultured L-2 cells, a cell line derived from rat Type II cells, but devoid of lamellar bodies. With concentrations of 10(-7)-10(-5) M iprindole, which approximate therapeutic plasma concentrations in human subjects, the drug induced the formation of lamellar bodies within 8 hours of incubation. This effect on cell morphology was rapidly lost after withdrawal of the drug. At concentrations of iprindole which induced lamellar body formation, there was a significant increase in phospholipid content of the L-2 cells as well as an increase in disaturated phosphatidylcholine, an important constituent of surfactant. These studies suggest that the use of drugs such as iprindole may represent a novel approach in the augmentation of phospholipid (and possibly surfactant) content of Type II cells in the lung.\r"

  ".U": "88021233\r", 
  ".W": "Cobra venom factor (CVF)-induced systemic activation of the complement system in the rat has been shown to result in the development of acute lung microvascular injury and appearance in lungs and plasma of lipid peroxidation products. The pathogenesis of these events is dependent on complement and neutrophils and is sensitive to pretreatment of experimental animals with iron chelators or scavengers of hydroxyl radical. In order to further analyze the role of complement in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in rats after systemic complement activation, two different CVFs have been employed in the present study. One was the previously used CVFn isolated from Naja n. naja venom, whereas the other factor, CVFh, was isolated from Naja h. haje venom. Both factors have been shown to activate the alternative complement pathway by forming a potent C3 convertase but differ with respect to their ability to bind and activate C5. CVFn but not CVFh activates C5 and distant complement components. When equal doses of C3-activating activity of CVFn or CVFh were injected intravenously into rats, CVFh-treated rats failed to develop acute lung injury, whereas CVFn-treated animals showed pronounced increases in lung vascular permeability. Similarly, in isolated blood perfused rat lungs neither the lung injury nor pulmonary hypertension caused by CVFn were found after injection of CVFh. In addition, CVFh-treated animals failed to show transient neutropenia or appearance in plasma of C5-derived chemotactic activity, although the extent of C3 conversion in vivo was identical to that seen in CVFn-treated rats. Morphologic examination of the lungs of the experimental animals revealed no signs of injury in CVFh-treated rats, whereas the lungs from CVFn-treated animals revealed interstitial and alveolar edema, as well as plugging of pulmonary capillaries with neutrophils, blebbing and/or destruction of vascular endothelial cells, fibrin deposition, and hemorrhage. These studies provide evidence that activation of the complement system involving C3 but not extending further in the complement sequence is not sufficient to bring about acute injury of the lung microvasculature and that the activation sequence must at least also involve C5.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in glomerular function and structure were studied in protein-overload nephrosis in the rat induced by intraperitoneal administration of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fractional clearance (C/GFR) studies using inulin and tracer proteins of different molecular size and charge revealed in proteinuric rats 1) unchanged glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow; 2) a 34-fold increase in C/GFR of rat serum albumin, reaching values similar to BSA; 3) a 2-fold increase in C/GFR for anionic horse radish peroxidase (HRP), but normal values for neutral and cationic HRP, and 4) an 11- and 3-fold increase for heterologous IgG and IgM, respectively. Glomerular epithelial cells showed degenerative changes, but the distribution of anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane was found to be unaltered, as determined by polyethyleneimine binding studies. In summary, an elevation of serum albumin concentration resulted in an increased transcapillary albumin transport. This was found to lead to degenerative changes of glomerular epithelial cells with development of large pore defects, which were completely reversible.\r"

A transcript migrating at 5.3 kilobases hybridizes with a mouse-derived C3 DNA probe in parallel cultures of endothelial cells, hepatoma cells (HepG2), and freshly isolated human monocytes. Steady-state transcript levels were as follows: HepG2 cells, 1.0; monocytes, 0.05; endothelial cells, 0.01. These data suggest that C3, an indispensible component for activation of complement by both the classical and alternative pathways, is locally synthesized in the vascular bed.\r"

Responders were compared with nonresponders for family history, baseline symptom factors, and ventricle-brain ratio (VBR). The lifetime risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders was higher among first-degree relatives of nonresponders than among first-degree relatives of responders. Treatment responders had higher baseline scores on the factors of activation and hostile-suspiciousness, but the groups did not differ in any other baseline symptom factor or in VBR. The authors suggest that there is an association between failure to respond to drugs and genetic loading for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.\r"
