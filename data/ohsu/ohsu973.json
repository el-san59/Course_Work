The effects of dopamine are blocked by haloperidol and SCH 23390, a D1 antagonist, but not by sulpiride, a D2 antagonist. The dopamine-induced morphological changes were mimicked by SKF 38393, a D1 agonist, but not by quinpirole, a D2 agonist. Kainate also caused process retraction, but other neuroactive substances tested including glutamate, 5-hydroxytryptamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glycine caused only minor changes in neurite length. Cyclic AMP analogues do not induce neurite retraction in horizontal cells, indicating that this effect of dopamine is not mediated by cyclic AMP. However, a protein kinase C activator (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and synthetic diacylglycerol analogs (1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and dioctanoglycerol) caused marked neurite retraction. Their effects, as well as the dopamine-induced changes, were blocked by staurosporine, a potent protein kinase antagonist. The results suggest that dopamine causes neurite retraction by the activation of protein kinase C via diacylglycerol.\r"

  ".U": "91088579\r", 
  ".W": "Little is known about the presence of trophic factors in the hypothalamus and the role they may play in regulating the functional development of hypothalamic neurons. We have investigated the ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) to affect the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), the neuropeptide that controls reproductive development. We have also determined whether the genes encoding EGF and TGF-alpha are expressed in the prepubertal female hypothalamus. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA utilizing a single-stranded EGF cDNA probe failed to reveal the presence of EGF mRNA in either the hypothalamus or the cerebral cortex at any age studied (fetal day 18 to postnatal day 36). In contrast, both a complementary RNA probe and a double-stranded TGF-alpha cDNA recognized in these regions a 4.5-kilobase (kb) mRNA species identical to TGF-alpha mRNA. The abundance of TGF-alpha mRNA was 3-4 times greater in the hypothalamus than in the cerebral cortex. Both EGF and TGF-alpha (2-100 ng/ml) elicited a dose-related increase in LHRH release from the median eminence of juvenile rats in vitro. They also enhanced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release. The transforming growth factors TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2 were ineffective. Only a high dose of basic fibroblast growth factor was able to increase LHRH and PGE2 release. Blockade of the EGF receptor transduction mechanism with RG 50864, a selective inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, prevented the effect of both EGF and TGF-alpha on LHRH and PGE2 release but failed to inhibit the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on LHRH release. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis abolished the effect of TGF-alpha on LHRH, indicating that PGE2 mediates TGF-alpha-induced LHRH release. The results indicate that the effect of EGF and TGF-alpha on LHRH release is mediated by the EGF/TGF-alpha receptor and suggest that TGF-alpha rather than EGF may be the physiological ligand for this interaction. Since in the central nervous system most EGF/TGF-alpha receptors are located on glial cells, the results also raise the possibility that--at the median eminence--TGF-alpha action may involve a glial-neuronal interaction, a mechanism by which the trophic factor first stimulates PGE2 release from glial cells, and then PGE2 elicits LHRH from the neuronal terminals.\r"

Recordings of auditory-evoked potentials in mice of one of these lines demonstrate that transgenic mice are deaf; in these mice spiral ganglia degenerate and most of the cochlear hair cells are absent. By using an S1 nuclease protection assay, we have detected RNA expression of the transgene in all tissues examined and, in particular, at high levels in brain.

We tested this idea by synthesizing a corticotropin (ACTH) analogue using a reverse reading of bovine mRNA for ACTH-(1-24). This peptide, designated ACTH-3'----5', had a similar hydropathic profile to native ACTH-5'----3' but had only 30% sequence homology and eight different charge substitutions. ACTH-3'----5' specifically bound to the surface of mouse Y-1 adrenal cells and to polyclonal anti-ACTH antibody. Additionally, ACTH-3'----5' stimulated cAMP synthesis and steroidogenesis in adrenal cells. These findings show that ACTH-3'----5' mimics the corticotropic properties of native ACTH, thereby further validating the molecular recognition theory.\r"

Small RNA chains (10-15 nucleotides) were synthesized in the presence of the four common ribonucleoside triphosphates, SV40 large tumor antigen (T antigen), the human DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha)-DNA primase complex, the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (HSSB), and topoisomerase I isolated from HeLa cells. The DNA primase-catalyzed reaction showed an absolute requirement for T antigen, HSSB, and pol alpha. The requirement for HSSB was not satisfied by other SSBs that can support the T-antigen-catalyzed unwinding of DNA containing the SV40 origin of replication. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis occurred with a lag that paralleled the lag observed in DNA synthesis. These results indicate that the specificity for the HSSB in the SV40 replication reaction is due to the pol alpha-primase-mediated synthesis of the Okazaki fragments. In contrast to this specificity, the elongation of Okazaki fragments can be catalyzed by a variety of different DNA polymerases, including high levels of pol alpha, the polymerase delta holoenzyme, T4 polymerase holoenzyme, the Escherichia coli polymerase III holoenzyme, and other polymerases. These observations suggest that leading-strand synthesis in the in vitro SV40 replication system can be nonspecific.\r"

  ".W": "3'-O-(4-Benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), a photoaffinity analog of ATP, was used as a ligand for a P2Y purinoceptor (adenine nucleotide receptor) present in intact Swiss 3T3 and 3T6 cells and A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. Photolysis of serum-starved cells in the presence of 10-50 microM BzATP, followed by extensive washing to remove unincorporated BzATP, induced the release of arachidonic acid. A trace (less than 0.01%) of photoincorporated BzATP was as effective as when 50 microM BzATP or ATP was contained in the incubation medium during the assay. Photoincorporated BzATP also stimulated the production of prostaglandin E2 and the accumulation of cyclic AMP. In previous studies, we demonstrated that these three events are obligatory early steps in a pathway leading to DNA synthesis in the above cell lines. The evidence indicated that the purinoceptor activated by extracellular ATP or BzATP was linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. Consistent with these observations, we now find that pertussis toxin inhibits the effect of photoincorporated BzATP on arachidonic acid release. These results indicate that BzATP is an effective agonist for the P2Y purinoceptor concerned with stimulation of DNA synthesis in 3T3, 3T6, and A-431 cells. Furthermore, after photolysis it becomes irreversibly associated with intact cells and promotes the activation of early events required for DNA synthesis.\r"

In contrast to the genes encoding the transplantation antigens, the Qa and Tla genes show very little polymorphism. Function(s) of the proteins encoded by the Qa and Tla loci remain an enigma. Recently, the protein products of the Qa and Tla loci, often referred to as class Ib major histocompatibility complex molecules, have been proposed to present antigen to gamma delta T cells. In mice, gamma delta T cells have been found concentrated in several epithelial barriers and in the skin; yet, expression of serologically detectable Tla antigens is believed restricted to thymocytes, activated T lymphocytes, and some T-cell leukemias. Here we report that luminal epithelial cells of the mouse small intestine express the thymus leukemia antigen (TLA). We also find that, unlike T cells in Peyer's patches, a significant fraction of intestinal epithelial lymphocytes also express TLA. RNA prepared from intestinal cells contains transcripts of the T18d gene, which encodes TLA. These data extend the known expression profile of TLA molecules to mature lymphocytes and to nonhematopoietic cells. These data also demonstrate the specific expression of TLA on antigen-presenting cells in a site enriched for T cells that express gamma delta T-cell antigen receptor.\r"

Pairwise comparisons of these alleles reveal two unexpected observations: (i) amino acid sequence similarity can be as low as 40% within species and (ii) some interspecific similarities are higher than intraspecific similarities. The gene genealogy clearly illustrates this unusual pattern of relationships. The data suggest that some of the polymorphism at the S locus existed prior to the divergence of these species and has been maintained to the present. In support of this hypothesis, the number of shared polymorphic sites was found to exceed the number found in simulations with independent accumulation of mutations. Strictly neutral evolution is exceedingly unlikely to maintain the polymorphism for such a long time. The allele multiplicity and extreme age of the alleles is consistent with Wright's classic one-locus population genetic model of gametophytic self-incompatibility. Similarities between the plant S locus and the mammalian major histocompatibility complex are discussed.\r"

By use of lipoxygenase-oxidized 2-[1-14C]linoleoyl PtdCho as the substrate and delipidated apoprotein B (apo-B), evidence is presented to show that (i) the activity is destroyed progressively during the oxidative modification of LDL; (ii) p-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB), a histidine modifier that inhibits the oxidative modification of LDL, also substantially inhibits the PLA2 activity; and (iii) photooxidation of LDL in the presence of Rose Bengal completely inactivates the enzyme with concomitant loss of apo-B histidine residues. High molecular weight proteins from delipidated LDL, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed PLA2 activity. It is suggested that apo-B itself may possess PLA2 activity.\r"

P49 was located in microsomes and highly induced after plating of isolated hepatocytes on collagen-coated culture dishes. To characterize P49, cDNA clones were screened from a rat liver lambda gt11 expression library. From sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs, the amino acid sequence of P49 was deduced, and the protein was identified as a previously uncharacterized form of cytochrome P450. P49 consists of 489 amino acids and shows approximately 60% similarity with the members of class IIC subfamily of rat cytochrome P450, such as P450IIC11 and P450IIC12 [formerly P-450(F-1)]. RNA blot analysis indicates that the mRNA translating P49 was induced approximately 20- to 30-fold at 70 hr in the primary cultures compared with the liver of adult rats. Induction of P49 was not affected by density of the plated cells and the presence or absence of several hormones, serum, or antibiotics in the culture medium. On the other hand, lower induction of P49 was seen when the hepatocytes were cultured on Matrigel-coated plates. Expression of P49 mRNA was low in the liver of adult rats and was not detectable in the livers of 1- and 2-week-old male and female rats. P49 is an additional form of cytochrome P450, which is induced in the primary culture of rat hepatocytes.\r"

In this report, we show that vitamin D receptors derived from nuclear extracts of mammalian cells bind directly to this cis-acting element in vitro and do so in a manner requiring hormone. Vitamin D receptors derived from reticulocyte lysate translations in vitro or from extracts of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that expresses the recombinant protein also bind the osteocalcin responsive element, but only when nuclear extracts of mammalian cells are provided. The vitamin-D-receptor-DNA-binding accessory factor is isolated by salt extraction, labile to temperature, and sensitive to tryptic digestion. These studies suggest that the high-affinity interaction of the vitamin D receptor with the osteocalcin vitamin D response element in vitro requires both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and an accessory protein derived from the mammalian cell nucleus.\r"

  ".U": "91088591\r", 
  ".W": "Cytochrome P450IIC5 (rabbit liver 21-hydroxylase) is unusual among hepatic forms of cytochromes P450 because it catalyzes the conversion of one active steroid hormone (progesterone) to another active hormone (deoxycorticosterone). Another interesting aspect of this steroid-hydroxylating enzyme is the ability to convert delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids to the delta 4-3-ketosteroid configuration. The delta 5-3-beta-hydroxysteroid, pregnenolone, was readily 21-hydroxylated, and this product was further metabolized to the delta 4-3-ketosteroid, deoxycorticosterone. It is suggested that the mechanism of this cytochrome P450-mediated, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5----4 isomerase-like reaction is through a gem-diol formation. In this study, COS-1 cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding cytochrome P450IIC5 to express a functional enzyme within the cell milieu. Transfected COS cells preferentially metabolize pregnenolone compared with all other steroids tested. Progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone are also 21-hydroxylated, whereas 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is a poor substrate. Substrate preference of this 21-hydroxylase differs from that seen with bovine adrenal P450XXIA1 (formerly P450C21) hydroxylase. Additionally, this study demonstrated that C19 steroids, like dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, are hydroxylated at the 16 alpha position. Contrary to previous reports, no metabolite of estradiol-17 beta was detected, presumably due to the unstable nature of catechol estrogens (2-hydroxyestradiol).\r"

We show that SIN3 does not encode SDP1 and that SDP1 DNA-binding activity is modulated in vitro by two factors, an inhibitory factor, I-SDP1, and a stimulatory factor, S-SDP1. I-SDP1 acts as an in vitro inhibitor of the SDP1 DNA-binding activity. Restoration of the DNA-binding activity is achieved by inclusion of a stimulatory factor, S-SDP1, which copurifies with the SIN3 protein. SDP1 DNA-binding activity was restored by treating a protein fraction containing SDP1 and I-SDP1 with the dissociating agent formamide.\r"

  ".W": "It was reported two decades ago that insulin was not detectable in the glucose-stimulated state in Saimiri sciurea, the New World squirrel monkey, by a radioimmunoassay system developed with guinea pig anti-pork insulin antibody and labeled pork insulin. With the same system, reasonable levels were observed in rhesus monkeys and chimpanzees. This suggested that New World monkeys, like the New World hystricomorph rodents such as the guinea pig and the coypu, might have insulins whose sequences differ markedly from those of Old World mammals. In this report we describe the purification and amino acid sequences of squirrel monkey insulin and glucagon. We demonstrate that the substitutions at B29, B27, A2, A4, and A17 of squirrel monkey insulin are identical with those previously found in another New World primate, the owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The immunologic cross-reactivity of this insulin in our immunoassay system is only a few percent of that of human insulin. Squirrel monkey glucagon is identical with the usual glucagon found in Old World mammals, which predicts that the glucagons of other New World monkeys would not differ from the usual Old World mammalian glucagon. It appears that the peptides of the New World monkeys have diverged less from those of the Old World mammals than have those of the New World hystricomorph rodents. The striking improvements in peptide purification and sequencing have the potential for adding new information concerning the evolutionary divergence of species.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified a region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter that is necessary for maximal constitutive, virus-induced, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription. This region contains three sites that match an NF-kappa B binding-site consensus sequence. We show that these three sites specifically bind NF-kappa B in vitro, yet each of these sites can be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the induction of the gene by virus or LPS. Moreover, when multimers of these three sites are placed upstream from a truncated TNF-alpha promoter, or a heterologous promoter, an increase in the basal level of transcription is observed that is influenced by sequence context and cell type. However, these multimers are not sufficient for virus or LPS induction of either promoter. Thus, unlike other virus- and LPS-inducible promoters that contain NF-kappa B binding sites, these sites from the TNF-alpha promoter are neither required nor sufficient for virus or LPS induction. Comparison of the sequence requirements of virus induction of the human TNF-alpha gene in mouse L929 and P388D1 cells reveals significant differences, indicating that the sequence requirements for virus induction of the gene are cell type-specific. However, the sequences required for virus and LPS induction of the gene in a single cell type, P388D1, overlap.\r"

It remains unclear how HSPGact can be generated by a biosynthetic pathway with no simple template for directing the ordered assembly of monosaccharide units. To examine this issue, we treated LTA cells with ethyl methanesulfonate and then isolated seven stable mutants that synthesize only 8-27% of the wild-type HSPGact but produce normal amounts of other HSPGs. These mutants are recessive in nature and fall into at least two different complementation groups. The delineation of the molecular basis of these defects should help to elucidate the manner by which cells synthesize HSPGs with regions of defined monosaccharide sequence.\r"

The TCR gene was placed under the control of the human beta-actin promoter and enhancer. Bone marrow cells pretreated with 5-fluorouracil were infected by coculturing with psi-2 virus-producing cells in the presence of recombinant interleukins 1, 2, 4, and 6 as well as interleukin 3 from WEHI-3 conditioned medium. The infected cells were transplanted into irradiated mice, and expression of the exogenous V beta 6 gene was examined with a V beta 6-specific monoclonal antibody, RNase protection, and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Three of seven mice expressed the retroviral TCR gene on the surface of a significant proportion of mature T cells 5-6 months after transplantation. In mice analyzed less than 1 month after transplantation, up to 30% of mature T cells expressed V beta 6 TCRs, an increase of at least 20% above the level of endogenous V beta 6 expression. DNA analysis revealed that pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells were infected by the retroviral vector in a long-term reconstituted mouse that showed increased V beta 6 expression.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) for the treatment of intracerebrally implanted rat gliosarcomas was tested. Preferential accumulation of 10B in tumors was achieved by continuous infusion of the sulfhydryl borane dimer, Na4(10)B24H22S2, at a rate of 45-50 micrograms of 10B per g of body weight per day from day 11 to day 14 after tumor initiation (day 0). This infusion schedule resulted in average blood 10B concentrations of 35 micrograms/ml in a group of 12 gliosarcoma-bearing rats and 45 micrograms/ml in a group of 10 similar gliosarcoma-bearing rats treated by BNCT. Estimated tumor 10B levels in these two groups were 26 and 34 micrograms/g, respectively. On day 14, boron-treated and non-boron-treated rats were exposed to 5.0 or 7.5 MW.min of radiation from the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor that yielded thermal neutron fluences of approximately 2.0 x 10(12) or approximately 3.0 x 10(12) n/cm2, respectively, in the tumors. Untreated rats had a median postinitiation survival time of 21 days. Reactor radiation alone increased median postinitiation survival time to 26 (5.0 MW.min) or 28 (7.5 MW.min) days. The 12 rats that received 5 MW.min of BNCT had a median postinitiation survival time of 60 days. Two of these animals survived greater than 15 months. In the 7.5 MW.min group, the median survival time is not calculable since 6 of the 10 animals remain alive greater than 10 months after BNCT. The estimated radiation doses to tumors in the two BNCT groups were 14.2 and 25.6 Gy equivalents, respectively. Similar gliosarcoma-bearing rats treated with 15.0 or 22.5 Gy of 250-kilovolt peak x-rays had median survival times of only 26 or 31 days, respectively, after tumor initiation.\r"

  ".W": "Bombesin is a tetradecapeptide originally isolated from frog skin; its mammalian homologue is the 27-amino acid peptide gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). cDNAs encoding GRP have been cloned from diverse species, but little is yet known about the amphibian bombesin precursor. Mass spectrometry of HPLC-separated skin exudate from Bombina orientalis was performed to demonstrate the existence of authentic bombesin in the skin of this frog. A cDNA library was prepared from the skin of B. orientalis and mixed oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate cDNAs encoding amphibian bombesin. Sequence analysis revealed that bombesin is encoded in a 119-amino acid prohormone. The carboxyl terminus of bombesin is flanked by two basic amino acids; the amino terminus is not flanked by basic amino acids but is flanked by a chymotryptic-like cleavage site. Northern blot analysis demonstrated similarly sized bombesin mRNAs in frog skin, brain, and stomach. Polymerase chain reaction was used to show that the skin and gut bombesin mRNAs encoded the identical prohormones. Prohormone processing, however, differed between skin and gut. Chromatography showed the presence of only authentic bombesin in skin whereas gut extracts contained two peaks of bombesin immunoreactivity, one consistent in size with bombesin and one closer in size to mammalian GRP. Thus the same bombesin prohormone is processed solely to bombesin in skin but is processed to a peptide similar in size to bombesin and to a peptide similar in size to mammalian GRP in stomach.\r"

  ".U": "91088603\r", 
  ".W": "Peripheral nerve from experimentally diabetic rats exhibits lowered levels of myo-inositol (MI) and decreased incorporation of [3H]MI into phosphatidylinositol (PI). There are indications that diminished PI turnover may be causally related to reduced Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in diabetic nerve. We have investigated whether a metabolic compartment of MI that is essential for PI synthesis is decreased in this tissue. Sciatic nerve segments from streptozotocin-induced diabetic and age-matched normal rats were incubated in vitro with either 32Pi or [3H]cytidine in the presence of propranolol. This cationic amphiphilic agent redirected nerve phospholipid metabolism to produce enhanced 32P incorporation into PI and decreased labeling of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. The accumulation of phosphatidyl CMP (CMP-PA) was also demonstrated by chromatographic and enzymatic means. The incorporation of [3H]cytidine into CMP-PA in normal nerve increased up to 15-fold when 0.6 mM propranolol was present. In diabetic nerve, the liponucleotide incorporated 2- to 3-fold more isotope and was more readily labeled at lower drug concentrations as compared to normal nerve. The buildup of [3H]CMP-PA was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of MI in the incubation medium at concentrations up to 3 mM. However, if MI was added after liponucleotide accumulation, preformed CMP-PA could not be utilized for PI synthesis. The difference in liponucleotide labeling between normal and diabetic nerve was nearly abolished at 0.3 mM medium MI, a concentration much less than the level of cyclitol in the tissue. These results strongly suggest the presence in nerve of a pool of MI that is not in equilibrium with the bulk of nerve MI and that is preferentially used for PI synthesis. This metabolic compartment is depleted in diabetic nerve but can be readily replenished by exogenous MI and may correspond to the MI pool that has been proposed to be required for the turnover of a portion of tissue PI involved in maintenance of normal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Whether compression nerve injury is due to ischemia, direct mechanical injury, or both remains unsettled. To assess structural changes of nerve during compression, peroneal nerves of rats were compressed at various pressures for different times, and the structural alterations were stopped by simultaneous in situ and perfusion fixation. The structural changes observed during a few minutes of compression cannot be explained by ischemic injury because the pathologic alterations characteristic of ischemia take many hours to develop and in any case are different from the ones found here. The pressure- and time-related structural changes observed in the present study under the cuff were (i) decrease in fascicular area and increase in fiber density due to expression of endoneurial fluid; (ii) compression and expression of axoplasm, sometimes to the point of fiber transection; (iii) lengthening of internodes; and (iv) obscuration of nodes of Ranvier due to cleavage and displacement of myelin and overlapping of nodes by displaced loops of myelin. At the edges of the cuff the changes were (i) increase of fascicular area probably from expressed endoneurial fluid; (ii) widening of nodal gaps, perhaps mainly from translocated axonal fluid; and (iii) disordered structure of axoplasm. We suggest that the process of paranodal demyelination and axonal transection are linked, occur during the act of compression, and are due to shear forces. The initial event is expression of endoneurial fluid, followed by compression and expression of axoplasm and cleavage and displacement of layers of myelin. Conceivably, with prolonged cuff compression ischemic injury might be found to be superimposed on mechanical injury.\r"

  ".W": "Intercellular coupling was studied in cultured rat optic nerve astrocytes individually characterized by A2B5 antibody staining. The presence of cell coupling was assessed by injecting single cells with the low molecular weight fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow and noting dye passage into adjacent cells; cell coupling was also studied by analyzing the decay phase of current transients recorded in response to small voltage steps using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Cell coupling was restricted to A2B5- astrocytes, the majority of which had a flat fibroblast-like appearance and was never observed in A2B5+ stellate-shaped astrocytes. Furthermore, A2B5- astrocytes showed coupling only to A2B5- and never to A2B5+ astrocytes. Analysis of current transients provided an additional indicator for cell coupling. Astrocytes that showed dye coupling to at least one neighboring cell required the sum of two exponential functions to fit current transients, whereas a single exponential function sufficed to fit transients in cells that were not dye coupled. The specificity of cell coupling in cultured rat optic nerve astrocytes suggests that predominantly A2B5- astrocytes comprise a coupled glial syncytium; this physiological feature of these cells may be a specialized adaptation for \"spatial buffering,\" the transport of K+ away from areas of focal extracellular accumulation. On the other hand, A2B5+ astrocytes form an uncoupled subpopulation of rat optic nerve glial cells that may serve different functions.\r"

We have isolated cDNA clones encoding mouse HNF-1 and expressed them in monkey COS cells and in the human T-cell line Jurkat, producing HNF-1 DNA-binding activity as well as transactivation of reporter constructs containing multimerized HNF-1 binding sites. In addition, the HNF-1 gene was assigned by somatic cell hybrids and recombinant inbred strain mapping to mouse chromosome 5 near Bcd-1 and to human chromosome 12 region q22-qter, revealing a homologous chromosome region in these two species. The presence of HNF-1 mRNA in multiple endodermal tissues (liver, stomach, intestine) suggests that HNF-1 may constitute an early marker for endodermal, rather than hepatocyte, differentiation. Further, that HNF-1 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity can be conferred by transfecting the HNF-1 cDNA into several cell lines indicates that it is sufficient to activate transcription in the context of ubiquitously expressed factors.\r"

Conditions were developed under which trypsin specifically degraded the antigens without inactivation of the immobilized antibody. After proteolysis, epitope peptides were dissociated from the antibody with 4 M MgCl2. The antigenic peptides were purified by HPLC and identified by 252Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry. The epitope recognized by h453 resides on the C-terminal tryptic peptides of human (residues 70-76) and guinea pig (residues 70-77) C3a. As an estimation of accuracy this method is able to provide, trypsin digestion of immune complexes caused cleavage of the antigen within a distance of two amino acid residues upstream from the epitope.\r"

  ".W": "Cytochrome a1 is a classic cytochrome that in the 1930s had already been detected in Acetobacter strains and in the 1950s was identified as a terminal oxidase. However, recent studies did not substantiate the previous observations. We have detected a cytochrome a1-like chromophore in Acetobacter aceti, which was purified and characterized in this study. The cytochrome was solubilized from membranes of the strain with octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside and was purified by single column chromatography. The purified cytochrome exhibited a broad alpha peak around 600-610 nm, which turned to a sharp peak at 589 nm in the presence of cyanide. Carbon monoxide difference spectra of the cytochrome indicated the presence of an alpha-type cytochrome. The cytochrome contained 1 mol each of hemes b and a and probably one copper ion. These results suggest that the cytochrome purified from A. aceti is the so-called cytochrome a1, and thus the existence of the classic cytochrome has been reconfirmed. The purified enzyme consisted of four polypeptides of 55, 35, 22, and 18 kDa, and it showed a sedimentation coefficient of 6.3 S in the native form. The enzyme had a high ubiquinol oxidase activity (140-160 mumol of ubiquinol-2 oxidized per min per mg of protein). When reconstituted into proteoliposomes, the cytochrome could generate an electrochemical proton gradient during oxidation of ubiquinol. Thus, cytochrome a1 of A. aceti has been shown to be a cytochrome ba terminal oxidase capable of generating an electrochemical proton gradient concomitant with ubiquinol oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "The light-dark adaptation reactions of a set of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) mutants that affect function and color of the chromophore were examined by using visible absorption spectroscopy. The absorbance spectra of the mutants Arg-82 in equilibrium Ala (Gln), Asp-85 in equilibrium Ala (Asn, Glu), Tyr-185 in equilibrium Phe, and Asp-212 in equilibrium Ala (Asn, Glu) were measured at different pH values during and after illumination. None of these mutants exhibited a normal dark-light adaptation, which in wild-type bR causes a red shift of the visible absorption maximum from 558 nm (dark-adapted bR) to 568 nm (light-adapted bR). Instead a reversible light reaction occurs in the Asp-85 and Asp-212 mutants from a blue form with lambda max near 600 nm to a pink form with lambda max near 480 nm. This light-induced shift explains the appearance of a reversed light adaptation previously observed for the Asp-212 mutants. In the case of the Tyr-185 and Arg-82 mutants, light causes a purple-to-blue transformation similar to the effect of lowering the pH. However, the blue forms observed in these mutants are not identical to those formed by acid titration or deionization of wild-type bR. It is suggested that in all of these mutants, the chromophore has lost the ability to undergo the normal 13-cis, 15-syn to all-trans, 15-anti light-driven isomerization, which occurs in native bR. Instead these mutants may have as stable forms all-trans,syn and 13-cis,anti chromophores, which are not allowed in native bR, except transiently.\r"

  ".W": "The F9 teratocarcinoma cell line differentiates in vitro after treatment with retinoic acid and cAMP and has been a widely used model system for the study of the molecular events that are responsible for cellular commitment and differentiation during early development. Previous experiments have suggested intriguing parallels between the control of gene expression during F9 cell differentiation and the regulation of gene expression by adenovirus E1A. Transfection of a 12S E1A-expressing plasmid into terminally differentiated, nonproliferating F9 cells generates, at high frequency, colonies of dividing cells, each of which expresses E1A. Cell lines established from these colonies proliferate in the presence of retinoic acid and have lost the fully differentiated phenotype as characterized by the absence of expression of a series of differentiation-specific genes. We conclude that expression of the viral 12S E1A gene product interferes with retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation. Moreover, the results suggest that the differentiation process, as defined by markers of terminal differentiation, may not be a permanent event but can be reversed by E1A expression.\r"

  ".U": "91088616\r", 
  ".W": "O6-Ethylguanine (O6-EtGua) is one of about a dozen different alkylation products formed in the DNA of cells exposed to the alkylating N-nitroso carcinogen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU). We have evaluated selectively the relative capacity of cells for the specific enzymatic repair of O6-EtGua as a determinant for the probability of malignant conversion. Eleven O6-EtGua-repair-proficient (R+) variant subclones were isolated from the O6-EtGua-repair-deficient (R-) clonal rat fibroblast line 208F by selection for resistance to 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (frequency, approximately equal to 10(-5). Contrary to the 208F wild-type cells, all variants expressed O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity, while both kinds of cells were deficient for repair of the DNA ethylation products O2- and O4-ethylthymine. After exposure to EtNU (less than or equal to 500 micrograms/ml; 20 min), cells were analyzed for the formation of piled-up foci in monolayer culture and of anchorage-independent colonies in semisolid agar medium. Depending on the EtNU concentration, the frequencies of piled-up foci and agar colonies, respectively, in the R+ variants were as low as 1/28th and 1/56th of those in the R- wild type. Contrasting with the cells from R+ variant-derived agar colonies, cells from 208F (R-) agar colonies gave rise to highly malignant tumors when implanted subcutaneously into syngeneic rats. No significant differences in the frequencies of piled-up foci were found between wild-type and variant cells after exposure to the major reactive metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene, (+)-7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy-9,10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10 alpha-tetrahydrobenzo[a] pyrene, for which stable binding to guanine O6 in cellular DNA has not been observed. The relative capacity of cells for repair of O6-alkylguanine is, therefore, a critical determinant for their risk of malignant conversion by N-nitroso carcinogens.\r"

Glucose-induced translocation of PKC has not been reported, and the relevant PKC isoenzymes in islets have not been identified. To address these issues, we developed specific antibodies to the alpha, beta, and gamma isoenzymes of PKC. Western blots of homogenates of freshly isolated rat islets probed with these antibodies revealed that the major isoenzyme present is alpha-PKC. Islets were perifused for 15 min with either 2.75 mM glucose, 20 mM glucose, 20 mM glucose plus 30 mM mannoheptulose, 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate, or alpha-ketoisocaproate plus mannoheptulose. Quantitative immunoblotting of membrane and cytosol fractions showed that alpha-PKC translocated from the cytosol to the membrane in freshly isolated rat islets stimulated with either 20 mM glucose or 15 mM alpha-ketoisocaproate. Both the secretory response and the translocation of alpha-PKC were blocked by the addition of mannoheptulose, an inhibitor of glucose metabolism, in islets stimulated with glucose but not in islets stimulated with alpha-ketoisocaproate. These results support a role for alpha-PKC in mediating glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets.\r"

Based upon this property, a phenotypic selection system has been developed for the isolation of clones containing eukaryotic SOD cDNAs. cDNA expression libraries from both Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and Arabidopsis thaliana were transformed into a SOD-deficient E. coli strain by electroporation, and clones containing functional SODs were selected by growth on minimal medium. Analysis of these clones revealed the identity of cDNAs encoding the iron form of superoxide dismutase (FeSOD)--the first SODs of this type to be cloned from eukaryotes. The presence of this enzyme in these two divergent plant species challenges previous ideas that FeSOD is found in only a few plant families. In addition, these results show the potential for shotgun cloning of eukaryotic genes by complementation of bacterial mutants, particularly when it is combined with a highly efficient transformation method, such as electroporation.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular basis of group A xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) was investigated by comparison of the nucleotide sequences of multiple clones of the XP group A complementing gene (XPAC) from a patient with group A XP with that of a normal gene. The clones showed a G----C substitution at the 3' splice acceptor site of intron 3, which altered the obligatory AG acceptor dinucleotide to AC. Nucleotide sequencing of cDNAs amplified by the polymerase chain reaction revealed that this single base substitution abolishes the canonical 3' splice site, thus creating two abnormally spliced mRNA forms. The larger form is identical with normal mRNA except for a dinucleotide deletion at the 5' end of exon 4. This deletion results in a frameshift with premature translation termination in exon 4. The smaller form has a deletion of the entire exon 3 and the dinucleotide at the 5' end of exon 4. The result of a transfection study provided additional evidence that this single base substitution is the disease-causing mutation. This single base substitution creates a new cleavage site for the restriction nuclease AlwNI. Analysis of AlwNI restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a high frequency of this mutation in Japanese patients with group A XP: 16 of 21 unrelated Japanese patients were homozygous and 4 were heterozygous for this mutation. However, 11 Caucasians and 2 Blacks with group A XP did not have this mutant allele. The polymorphic AlwNI restriction fragments are concluded to be useful for diagnosis of group A XP in Japanese subjects, including prenatal cases and carriers.\r"

The isolation of the intact gene would provide an essential substrate to analyze the molecular basis of this malignancy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested that this three-exon gene was several hundred kilobases (kb) long. Therefore, a library of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones was screened to isolate the intact BCL2 gene. Two clones, yA85B6 (200 kb) and yB206A6 (700 kb), were isolated by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for exon I/II and exon III, respectively. However, neither YAC contained the entire BCL2 locus. Since the two YACs were found to overlap by 60 kb, we sought to take advantage of the high recombination frequency in yeast and induce physical recombination between the two clones. Cells containing each YAC were mated and induced to undergo meiotic division and sporulation. Analysis of the resulting tetrads revealed a spore containing a single recombinant YAC of 800 kb. PCR assays and Southern blotting demonstrated that this recombined YAC contained the entire approximately 230-kb BCL2 gene. Furthermore, probe order was conserved and there was no evidence of overt rearrangements or deletions. These results indicate the feasibility of reconstructing large genomic segments with overlapping YAC clones to study genes spanning hundreds of kilobases.\r"

Here, we report an efficacious method for such isolation in which the diphtheria toxin A-fragment gene is used to negatively select nonhomologous recombinants. In contrast to the use of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, the selection can be made singly by the neomycin analog G418 without using a drug such as ganciclovir, a nucleoside analog. At the c-fyn locus, the diphtheria-toxin negative selection enriched the recombinants about 10-fold, and half of the cells integrating with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene were homologous recombinants.\r"

We now report on the identification of a neurophysin-like precursor in human lung carcinoma (LX-1) cell membrane. mAb L6 immunoaffinity chromatography of solubilized membranes resulted in a single band of approximately 45 kDa. Western blot analysis demonstrated immunoreactivity of this band with mAb L6, anti-vasopressin, and an antibody to the vasopressin precursor, pro-pressophysin. N-terminal sequencing of this band demonstrated a 21-amino acid homology with the N terminus of human pro-pressophysin, and substitution of a Cys33 residue in the tumor antigen with Arg33. Absence of immunoreactivity with the antibodies described above in cytosolic extracts and culture medium suggests nonsecretion of processed or intact pro-pressophysin-like peptide. Northern analysis of LX-1 mRNA with a 30-mer to the C terminus of rat pro-pressophysin resulted in a band of approximately 1000 base pairs, 250 base pairs larger than hypothalamic message. In situ hybridization of LX-1 tumor-bearing nude rat brain with the same probe demonstrated specific hybridization in rat hypothalamus and xenografted tumor. These findings suggest expression of a pro-pressophysin-like protein in this tumor cell line that is preferentially targeted to the cell membrane.\r"

According to one view, these autoantibodies arise as a result of an immune response to foreign antigens such as infectious agents that share, by molecular mimicry, common structures with host proteins. An alternative view is that the target autoantigen itself initiates, selects, and sustains autoantibody synthesis. We show here that anti-Jo-1 autoantibodies directed against histidyl-tRNA synthetase in the human autoimmune muscle disease polymyositis undergo, in addition to spectrotype broadening and class switching, the sine qua non of an immune response to the target antigen--affinity maturation to that antigen. We demonstrate further that these autoantibodies, unlike anti-synthetase antibodies induced in mice immunized with heterologous antigen, bind only nonlinear epitopes on the native human synthetase that remain exposed when the enzyme is complexed to tRNA(His). These data suggest that the native target autoantigen itself has played a direct role in selecting and sustaining the autoantibody response and sharply restrict the time and the way in which a molecular mimic might act to provoke autoantibodies.\r"

Therefore, the extent of variation within the nucleic acid sequence encoding this epitope was studied in DNA directly obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of six children and their plasma donor. This revealed that the quasi-species distribution of sequences obtained after cloning varied from recipient to recipient and that the distance from the donor sequences increased over time. V3 nucleotide evolution rates averaged 9.5 x 10(-3) per site per year for silent sites and 11.4 x 10(-3) per site per year for nonsilent sites (vs. 9.7 and 9.8 x 10(-3) per site per year for a control region 5' adjacent to the V3 region) and, although individual differences were observed, did not correlate with the serum antigen levels or disease progression. Sequences of both the epitope coding region itself (V3) and the control region upstream diverted more from the donor sequence among children not progressing to AIDS than among children progressing to AIDS. The evolution of V3 sequences is apparently host dependent, rapid, and independent of the level of antigen expression.\r"

We show here that intracellular thiol levels play a key role in regulating this process. That is, stimulation with tumor necrosis factor alpha and/or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activates NF-kappa B and markedly decreases intracellular thiols; N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an efficient thiol source, prevents this thiol decrease and blocks the activation of NF-kappa B; and the lack of activated NF-kappa B prevents the activation of the HIV LTR and the transcription of genes under its control. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized genetic regulatory mechanism in which cytokine-induced shifts in intracellular thiol levels are crucial in the control of NF-kappa B activity and thereby influence the spectrum of genes expressed by cytokine-stimulated cells.\r"

A phage lambda library prepared from genomic DNA of a tertiary Lec1 transfectant (3 degrees T) has now been used to obtain clones encoding an active GlcNAc-TI enzyme. A small genomic DNA fragment [approximately 4.6 kilobases (kb)], isolated from an Alupositive lambda clone, conferred human GlcNAc-TI activity upon transfection into Lec1 cells. An approximately 1.3-kb probe generated from this DNA fragment detected unique but distinct DNA fragments in human and CHO genomic DNA. The probe also hybridized to a poly(A)+ RNA of approximately 2.7 kb in human and CHO cells and allowed the isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding human GlcNAc-TI activity. The overall features of the cDNA and deduced protein sequence (445 amino acids) are typical of other Golgi transferases that are type II transmembrane proteins.

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is attributed to a failure of pancreatic beta cells to maintain insulin secretion at a level sufficient to compensate for underlying insulin resistance. In the ZDF rat, a model of NIDDM that closely resembles the human syndrome, we have previously reported profound underexpression of GLUT-2, the high-Km facilitative glucose transporter expressed by beta cells of normal animals. Here we report that islets of diabetic rats exhibit a marked decrease in the volume of GLUT-2-positive beta cells and a reduction at the electron-microscopic level in the number of GLUT-2-immunoreactive sites per unit of beta-cell plasma membrane. The deficiency of GLUT-2 cannot be induced in normal beta cells by in vivo or in vitro exposure to high levels of glucose nor can it be prevented in beta cells of prediabetic ZDF rats by elimination of hyperglycemia. We conclude that this dearth of immunodetectable GLUT-2 in NIDDM is not secondary to hyperglycemia and therefore that it may well play a causal role in the development of hyperglycemia.\r"

To our knowledge, neither transforming mutations in oncogenes nor mutations in tumor suppressor genes have been reported in human esophageal tumors. We examined four human esophageal carcinoma cell lines and 14 human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing for the presence of p53 mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Two cell lines and five of the tumor specimens contained a mutated allele (one frameshift and six missense mutations). All missense mutations detected occurred at G.C base pairs in codons at or adjacent to mutations previously reported in other cancers. The identification of aberrant p53 gene alleles in one-third of the tumors we tested suggests that mutations at this locus are common genetic events in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.\r"

  ".U": "91088632\r", 
  ".W": "Diversity of gamma-aminobutyrate type A (GABAA) receptors has recently been proposed to be achieved by assembly of receptor subtypes from a multitude of subunits (alpha 1-6, beta 1-3, gamma 1-2, and delta) encoded by different genes. Here we report a further mechanism for creating GABAA receptor diversity: alternative RNA splicing. Two forms of bovine gamma 2 subunit cDNA were isolated (gamma 2S and gamma 2L) that differed by the presence or absence of a 24-base-pair (8-amino acid) insertion in the cytoplasmic domain between the third and fourth putative membrane-spanning regions. Polymerase chain reaction from RNA demonstrated that the two forms of gamma 2 subunit are expressed in bovine, human, and rat brain. Sequencing of genomic DNA clones encoding the gamma 2 subunit demonstrated that the 24-base-pair insert is organized as a separate exon. Analysis of the sequence of the 8-amino acid insert revealed that it contains a protein kinase C consensus phosphorylation site. Expression of the large cytoplasmic loop domains of gamma 2S and gamma 2L in Escherichia coli, followed by phosphorylation of the recombinant proteins by protein kinase C, demonstrated that gamma 2L, but not gamma 2S, could be phosphorylated. Thus the two forms of gamma 2 subunit differ by the presence or absence of a protein kinase C phosphorylation site. This mechanism for creating GABAA receptor diversity may allow differential regulation of the function of receptor subtypes.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, activates at least three types of channel-forming receptors defined by the selective agonists N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate, and quisqualate [or more selectively by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)]. Activation of the NMDA receptor requires glycine as well as NMDA or glutamate. Recent studies have provided evidence that certain polyamines potentiate the binding by NMDA receptors of glycine and the open channel blocker MK-801. To determine whether polyamines alter channel opening, we examined their effects on rat brain glutamate receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our results demonstrate that spermine potentiates the response of the NMDA receptor but has no effect on responses to kainate and quisqualate. Furthermore, spermine increases the maximum response to NMDA and glycine and acts, at least in part, by increasing the apparent affinity of the NMDA receptor/channel complex for glycine. The present findings and the fact that polyamines are a natural constituent of brain suggest that polyamines may play a role in the regulation of glutamatergic transmission.\r"

The first reactions of C40 carotenoid biosynthesis proceed through common intermediates in all organisms, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of early enzymes from this pathway. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three genes from the carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster of Erwinia herbicola, a nonphotosynthetic epiphytic bacterium, which encode homologs of the CrtB, CrtE, and CrtI proteins of Rhodobacter capsulatus, a purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium. CrtB (prephytoene pyrophosphate synthase), CrtE (phytoene synthase), and CrtI (phytoene dehydrogenase) are required for the first three reactions specific to the carotenoid branch of general isoprenoid metabolism. The homologous proteins from E. herbicola and R. capsulatus show sequence identities of 41.7% for CrtI, 33.7% for CrtB, and 30.8% for CrtE. E. herbicola and R. capsulatus CrtI also display 27.2% and 27.9% sequence identity, respectively, with R. capsulatus CrtD (methoxyneurosporene dehydrogenase). All three dehydrogenases possess a hydrophobic N-terminal domain containing a putative ADP-binding beta alpha beta fold characteristic of enzymes known to bind FAD or NAD(P) cofactors. In addition, E. herbicola and R. capsulatus CrtB show 25.2% and 23.3% respective sequence identities with the protein product of pTOM5, a tomato cDNA of unknown function that is differentially expressed during fruit ripening. These data indicate the structural conservation of early carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes in evolutionarily diverse organisms.\r"

(1990) Nature (London) 343, 762-764]. To directly compare the effects of gp55 with erythropoietin (Epo), we produced retrovirions that encode either gp55, Epo, or EpoR. After infection with EpoR virus, interleukin 3-dependent DA-3 cells bound 125I-labeled Epo and grew without interleukin 3 in the presence of Epo. These latter cells, but not parental DA-3 cells, became factor-independent after superinfection either with Epo virus or with Friend spleen focus-forming virus. In addition, Epo virus caused a disease in mice that mimicked Friend erythroleukemia. Although Fv-2r homozygotes are susceptible to all other retroviral diseases, they are resistant to both Epo viral and Friend viral erythroleukemias. These results indicate that both gp55 and Epo stimulate EpoR and that the Fv-2 gene encodes a protein that controls response to these ligands. However, the Fv-2 protein is not EpoR because the corresponding genes map to opposite ends of mouse chromosome 9. These results have important implications for understanding signal transduction by EpoR and the role of host genetic variation in controlling susceptibility to an oncogenic protein.\r"

  ".W": "Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp-1; osteopontin) is one of the abundant noncollagenous proteins in bone matrix and is produced by osteoblasts. We examined the promoter region of the mouse Spp-1 gene and identified a sequence responsible for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 enhancement of the Spp-1 gene expression. This 24-base-pair (bp) sequence (vitamin D response element) is located 761 bp upstream of the transcription start site and consists of two direct repeats of a unique 9-bp motif, AGGTTCACG. The vitamin D response element confers responsiveness of a heterologous promoter to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in a position- and orientation-independent and copy-number-dependent manner. The basal level of expression of the reporter constructs containing this sequence and its response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were not affected by cotreatment with transforming growth factor beta or the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or by cotransfection with a JUN expression vector. The vitamin D response element forms DNA-protein complexes, as indicated by gel-retardation assays. The addition of a monoclonal antibody raised against the vitamin D receptor further retarded the mobility of the DNA-protein complex. Another antibody that recognizes the DNA binding region of the vitamin D receptor attenuated its binding to the sequence. These results indicate that this 24-bp sequence containing two 9-bp motifs binds to the vitamin D receptor and mediates the vitamin D3 enhancement of murine Spp-1 gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "In this review, we have made use of some simple engineering concepts to summarize current efforts relating QCT measures to bone density and strength. From a variety of in vitro experiments on cadaveric vertebrae and femora, it is evident that both apparent and ash densities are strong linear functions of QCT measures, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.49 to 0.90 and relative errors from 44.9% to 7.1%. QCT data also can be used (with somewhat less confidence) to determine the compressive modulus (R2s from 0.36 to 0.68, relative errors from 45.0% to 35.5%) and compressive strength (R2s from 0.58 to 0.70, relative errors from 56.5% to 39.9%) of trabecular bone from the proximal femur and vertebral body. In cortical bone, material properties are only correlated weakly with QCT measures. Experiments designed to relate QCT data to failure loads for the proximal femur and vertebral body have been remarkably successful. Coefficients of determination have ranged from 0.32 to 0.93, with relative errors from 31.1% to 13.9%. However, when the in vitro failure loads determined in these experiments are compared against available estimates of in vivo loads on the spine and hip, it is apparent, at least in the elderly, that in vivo loads are relatively close to those that cause fracture in vitro. To assess the possibility of developing QCT-based clinical predictors of fracture risk for individual patients, we have introduced the concept factor of risk often used in engineering design to account for uncertainties in estimates of service loads and component strength. The factor of risk for a particular loading condition is defined as the ratio of expected service loads to the known failure loads. To extend this concept to densitometric fracture risk prediction in vivo, it is important to recognize that densitometric data must not only be used to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity of the region of interest, but that this ultimate load must then be compared to the forces expected in vivo under comparable loading conditions. One difficulty with this approach is that little is known about the in vivo forces that are associated with atraumatic age-related fractures of the hip and vertebrae and even less about the forces applied to the hip and spine during traumatic events such as falls. However, from available estimates of in vivo loads during bending and lifting, it is apparent that in the elderly, factors of risk for the spine can easily approach 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A variety of tumors and nontumorous lesions were used to illustrate some of the biologic, clinical, and pathologic aspects of inappropriate or ectopic endocrine and metabolic syndromes that have musculoskeletal repercussions. It is clear, both from the discussion and case material, that many mechanisms of ectopic endocrine syndromes have yet to be clarified. Elaborate techniques are available for hormonal estimations, but their routine use is prohibitively expensive and relatively unrewarding. Cells of a given lesion may be functionally heterogeneous or may fail to elaborate active products in substantial amounts. Different cells may produce similar peptides, while the same cells can produce more than one. Despite these difficulties, recognition of ectopic endocrine syndromes remains crucial to diagnosis and patient management, and thus corroboration or correlation must often rest on a cruder basis. In fact, the clinical significance of basic laboratory data, e.g., PTH elevation, may vary, as PTH may be immunoreactive but biologically inactive. As another example, hypercalcemia associated with myeloma may be variously related to coexistent hyperparathyroidism, renal disease, dehydration, or humoral osteolysis. Therefore, roentgenographic evidence of bone destruction or skeletal stigmata of hyperparathyroidism imbues laboratory data with greater significance. Paraneoplastic syndromes are of particular concern to the radiologist, as multiple systemic manifestations, occurring either synchronously or metachronously, may suggest the presence of an underlying or unifying lesion or even of a specific type of neoplasm. They may precede detection of neoplasms by months to years and can develop at any time during their course. Paraneoplastic syndromes may, furthermore, parallel the course of a lesion and be used as indicators of remission or recurrence. Conversely, those unassociated with overt symptoms possess endocrine markers that can reinforce sometimes silent skeletal stigmata. Familiarity with representative secretory products influencing the musculoskeletal system per se may often clarify seemingly innocuous and sometimes asymptomatic skeletal findings. Alert imagers may, therefore, detect, infer, or suspect particular syndromes when they present in a specific sequence or mosaic. Conversely, when apprised of their existence, imagers should know where their related effects may be sought or anticipated. Such relationships, sometimes serendipitously discovered, may be valuable assets in clinical diagnosis and patient management in both suspected and unsuspected cases.\r"

  ".W": "The manifestations of endocrine derangements in the musculoskeletal system in infancy and childhood are disturbances in growth and maturation and in adulthood are disturbances in maintenance and metabolism. Hypercortisolism during skeletal immaturity suppresses growth. In the adult, hypercortisolism leads to osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and muscle wasting. Deficiency of growth hormone during skeletal development results in short stature. An excess of growth hormone in a skeletally immature individual results in gigantism, an excess in a skeletally mature individual results in acromegaly. Patients with gigantism have extreme height with normal body proportions. Musculoskeletal manifestations of acromegaly include soft-tissue thickening, vertebral body enlargement, characteristic hand and foot changes, and enthesal bony proliferation. Hyperthyroidism causes catabolism of protein and loss of connective tissue, which manifest as muscle wasting. Deficient levels of thyroid hormone cause defects in growth and development. Severe growth retardation from congenital hypothyroidism is rare because neonatal screening recognizes the disorder and leads to early treatment. The skeletal manifestation of hypergonadism in children is precocious growth and early skeletal maturation. Although the initial precocious growth spurt results in a tall child, early closure of the growth plates results in a short adult. Hypogonadism in the prepubertal child results in delayed adolescence and delayed skeletal maturation. Diabetes mellitus in childhood results in decreased growth, a phenomenon presumed to be secondary to nutritional abnormalities. Generalized osteoporosis and short stature are common. In the adult, generalized osteoporosis may accompany insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus if obesity is absent. Calcification of interdigital arteries of the foot is common in diabetics and uncommon in other conditions. Additional skeletal manifestations relate to complications of diabetes such as peripheral neuropathy and diabetic foot disease.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoporosis, a condition of decreased bone tissue that increases the likelihood of fracture, places a significant burden on our society in terms of health cost and morbidity. The most common type of osteoporosis is involutional, and two subtypes are recognized: type 1 and type 2. Type 1, or postmenopausal, osteoporosis is most commonly seen in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women from ages 51 to 75. Estrogen deficiency is the most dominant factor in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Type 2, or aging related, osteoporosis is seen in elderly women and men aged 70 or more. Bone loss in this group is related to aging, estrogen deficiency, negative calcium balance, and a variety of environmental and genetic factors. The best approach to the management of osteoporosis is to develop a lifelong strategy that maximizes peak bone mass and minimizes aging-related and postmenopausal bone loss. Estrogen is the only medication approved for the prevention of bone loss that is in general use. Other strategies to prevent bone loss (and maximize peak bone mass) include adequate calcium intake, adequate exercise, and avoidance of excess alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use.\r"

  ".U": "91088755\r", 
  ".W": "Since the introduction of routine automated measurements of serum calcium levels in the 1970s, the detection of primary hyperparathyroidism has risen considerably. Nevertheless, the severe bone changes described by von Recklinghausen are still quite rare. The apparent rise in incidence is accounted for by the discovery of a large group of predominantly asymptomatic elderly patients who have mild primary hyperparathyroidism. Because the diagnosis is most often confirmed through laboratory tests, radiologic studies are now most useful in assessing the severity of the disease. The presence of bone changes is an accepted indication for parathyroid surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism. For patients with asymptomatic disease in whom nonsurgical treatment may be considered, radiographic evaluation is one of several techniques that may be used to assess progression. High resolution radiographs of the hands are most valuable in this regard. Accelerated bone mineral loss, as measured by quantitative techniques, will probably play a significant role in the future. Radiographic follow-up of patients with renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism is equally important, as increased bone or soft tissue changes may indicate a need for therapeutic change. Radiographically identifiable changes of hyperparathyroidism consist mainly of various types of accelerated bone resorption. Multifocal subperiosteal resorption is generally considered to be pathognomonic of hyperparathyroidism. Subligamentous, subchondral, endosteal, and intracortical resorption are also important manifestations of accelerated bone turnover. The earliest bone changes are visible in the hands and should be searched for especially carefully in the phalanges and terminal tufts. Only occasionally will changes be found elsewhere in the skeleton when hand changes are not present.\r"

In an effort to standardize the sagittal measurement, a canal ratio, using the vertebral body diameter, has been formulated. If this method is to be used in the pediatric spine, the effect of the growing neuraxis must be considered. Lateral cervical spine radiographs of 301 normal children and adults were evaluated and grouped according to age. The canal ratio measurement demonstrated a consistent decrease through to the adult groups. Adjacent groups showed statistically significant decreases with age in all groups tested other than the oldest two groups. With the pediatric spinal canal vulnerable to various intracanalicular influences, the canal ratio may reflect early disease processes.\r"

Ten healthy adult males performed multiple, submaximal isometric neck flexion tasks before and after pain had been induced in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle by injecting 5 ml of a hypertonic (5%) saline solution. A similar volume of isotonic saline was injected into the contralateral muscle as a control. Cervical myoelectric signal (MES) root-mean-square (RMS) response to each injection was recorded from eight neck muscles over 8 minutes. The subject rated perceived pain at regular intervals using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sternocleidomastoid pain, which reached a mean of 36 mm on the 100-mm VAS 2 minutes after the injection, resulted in significantly increased (1-2 microV, P less than 0.05) RMS MES in the otherwise relaxed SCM muscle during the first 2 minutes. This was followed by a gradual return to control values after 5 minutes. A similar trend in MES was found for the active SCM muscle during a 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) isometric neck flexion effort. Thus, acute deep muscle pain caused subtle, yet systematic, changes in motor output in both the relaxed and active painful muscle, and its synergists and antagonists.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior cervical fusion was initially described in the 1950s for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy. The indications for this procedure in the management of soft disc herniation have not been clearly defined. In addition, controversy exists as to whether a cervical soft herniation should be managed by an anterior approach or a posterior cervical laminotomy-foraminotomy. The authors report the results of a prospective study comparing anterior discectomy and fusion to posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy for the management of soft cervical disc herniation. Twenty-eight patients underwent anterior discectomy and fusion (Robinson horseshoe graft) while 16 patients underwent posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy. The disc herniations were classified into two types. Type I were single level anterolateral herniations (33 patients) while type II were central soft disc herniations (11 patients). Clinically, patients with type I herniations manifested signs and symptoms of radiculopathy while patients with type II herniations manifested signs of myelopathy or neck pain and bilateral upper extremity paresthesias in 4 patients. Confirmatory studies were myelography in 12 patients, myelography combined with computed tomography (CT) in 26 patients, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 6 patients. For type I herniations, 17 patients underwent anterior fusion while 16 patients had a posterior laminotomy-foraminotomy. The 11 patients classified as type II herniation all underwent anterior discectomy and fusion. There were 27 men and 17 women. The age range was 21 to 52 years (mean, 41 years). The follow-up was 1.6 to 8.2 years (mean, 4.2 years).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of the importance of compressive forces in neck injuries, this research was conducted using compression as the primary load vector. Six fresh human cadaveric head-neck complexes were prepared by fixing the distal end in methylmethacrylate. Tests were done with varying loading rates to include quasistatic and dynamic conditions. For quasistatic experiments, the proximal end was fixed to the piston of the testing device. In dynamic tests, the cranium was unconstrained, and to maintain stability, the effects of the spinal musculature were simulated by means of pulleys, deadweights, and springs in the anterior and posterior parts of the head-neck complex. Quasistatic tests conducted at a rate of 2.0 mm/sec produced cervical spine trauma at forces ranging from 1.7 to 2.3 kN, with deformations ranging from 2.2 to 3.7 cm. The specimens were deep-frozen at the level of injury, preserving the local deformation of the tissues to enable a detailed evaluation immediately after the injury. Dynamic tests conducted at velocities of 3.2 to 5.7 m/sec resulted in impact injuries at one level of the head-neck complex. The applied forces at the vertex were considerably higher than those recorded at the distal end. The failure deformations for both the quasistatic (2.2-3.7 cm) and dynamic (1.7-3.2 cm) tests, however, were found to be similar, suggesting that the human head-neck complex is a deformation-sensitive structure.\r"

The authors performed an in vivo experiment using a canine model to study the natural history of spinal instability as a function of healing time up to 12 weeks. Three injuries were produced surgically: sham; laminectomy at C4; and bilateral facetectomy at C4-C5. Three 1.5-mm steel balls were implanted into C3 to C6 vertebrae at the time of surgery. Standardized functional flexion-extension stereoradiographs of the cervical spine were obtained before injury, immediately after injury and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, 9, and 12 weeks postinjury and immediately after killing the animals. In general, the authors found decreased ranges of motion (ROM) at the C4-C5 level, compared with the pre-injury values, for all injuries, but most significantly for the facetectomy. The maximum decrease occurred between 0 and 0.5 weeks postinjury. Between 2 and 12 weeks, there was recovery in the ROM, especially for the two less severe injuries. The changes in the ROM at each spinal level were explained by simultaneous presence of a destabilizing factor, caused by the three different injuries with the sham as the least and the facetectomy as the most destabilizing injury, and a stabilizing mechanism of muscle spasm in the beginning and of healing and other adaptive responses in the late phase after injury. Because of the significant differences between the canine model and the human cervical spine, the present findings should be extrapolated to the human situation with caution.\r"

Using a canine model, three injuries of varying degrees of severity were surgically produced at the C4-C5 level and allowed to heal for 6 months. No internal or external support was provided. The harvested cervical spines (C2-C7) were subjected to three-dimensional biomechanical testing by applying individually six pure moments. The resulting three-dimensional displacements were recorded using stereophotogrammetry, and the intervertebral motions were calculated. The results are compared with the in vivo behavior of the same specimens and with an in vitro control group. At 1 N-m, the average flexion-extension range of motion (ROM) for the intact C4-C5 level was 24.5 degrees (standard deviation [SD], 6.6 degrees). A facetectomy at this level significantly increased the in vitro ROM to 51.1 degrees (SD, 4.4 degrees). The in vitro ROM decreased to 19.8 degrees (SD, 7.3 degrees) in the facetectomized group of this study, which were allowed to heal for 6 months before death. Similar results were obtained in axial rotation and lateral bending. The findings show that after 6 months of healing, the injured canine spine, although acutely hypermobile, exhibited biomechanical characteristics that were not different from those of the normal intact specimens.\r"

This design eliminates potential neurologic complications usually associated with the anterior plate system, but maintains the mechanical advantages of internal fixation. The authors reviewed 13 consecutive patients in whom the THSP system was applied. Indications for the use of this device included acute trauma in three patients, trauma of more than 6 weeks' duration in five patients, and spondylosis in five patients. Fifteen plates and 58 screws were placed, with no screws purchasing the posterior cortex. Postoperative immobilization varied from no immobilization to four-poster brace. With a mean follow-up of 13 months, all 13 patients went on to fusion. One patient had screws placed in the disc rather than in bone and went on to malunion. In all other patients, radiographs did not demonstrate screw migration, screw-bone lucency, graft dislodgement, or malunion. No patient suffered neurologic injury as a result of this device. The THSP system facilitates reliable fusion with minimal complications. Its use should be considered in multilevel anterior spine defects, posttraumatic cervical kyphosis, and cervical fractures with posterior disruption requiring anterior fusion.\r"

  ".W": "The axial torque until failure of the ligamentous occipito-atlanto-axial complex (C0-C1-C2) subjected to axial angular rotation (theta) was characterized using a biaxial MTS system. A special fixture and gearbox that permitted right axial rotation of the specimen until failure without imposing any additional constraints were designed to obtain the data. The average values for the axial rotation and torque at the point of maximum resistance were, respectively, 68.1 degrees and 13.6 N-m. The specimens offered minimal resistance (approximately 0.5 N-m), up to an average axial rotation of 21 degrees across the complex. The torque-angular rotation (T-theta) curve can be divided into four regions: regions of least and steadily increasing resistances, a transition zone that connects these two regions, and the increasing resistance region to the point of maximum resistance. The regions of least and steadily increasing resistances may be represented by two straight lines with average slopes of 0.028 and 0.383 N-m/degree, respectively. Post-test dissection of the specimens disclosed the following. The point of maximum resistance corresponded roughly to the value of axial rotation at which complete bilateral rotary dislocation of the C1-C2 facets occurred. The types of injuries observed were related to the magnitude of axial rotation imposed on a specimen during testing. Soft-tissue injuries alone (like stretch/rupture of the capsular ligaments, subluxation of the C1-C2 facets, etc.) were confined to specimens rotated up to or close to the point of maximum resistance. The specimens that were subjected to rotations up to the point of maximum resistance of the curve spontaneously reduced completely on removal from the testing apparatus. Spontaneous reduction was not possible for specimens tested slightly beyond their points of maximum resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several cases of occipito-atlantal instability have been reported in patients with Down's syndrome. However, standards for radiographic measurement and normal values for translational motion at the occiput-C1 level have not been established for the Down's patient. A retrospective analysis of 102 flexion and extension lateral cervical spine radiographs of 73 patients with Down's syndrome was performed. Patients with congenital cervical spine anomalies, C1-C2 instability, or previous neck surgery were excluded. Occiput-C1 translation was measured by the technique described by Wiesel and Rothman. In normal adult patients, occiput-C1 translation should be no more than 1 mm by this method. Analysis of the data demonstrated a range of 0 to 10 mm, with a mean of 2.62 mm and a standard deviation of +/- 1.94 mm. Only 30 sets of films (29%) representing 27 patients (37%) showed anteroposterior translation of 1 mm or less. This laxity was not dependent on patient age in the current study group. A review of these patients' medical records did not disclose any evidence of impaired neurologic function related to cervical spine instability. The authors' data suggest that the prevalence and magnitude of occipito-atlantal instability in Down's syndrome is greater than previously appreciated.\r"

Symptoms were present in 47 of the younger patients at presentation. The mean duration of time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in this group was 4.9 months. Risk factors for carcinoma of the colon and rectum were identified in 14 of 50 patients less than 40 years old. A significantly greater proportion of patients less than 40 years old had Stage C disease compared with the older group of patients (42 versus 22 per cent, p = 0.014). Stage B disease was more common in patients more than 40 years of age (44.8 versus 26.0 per cent, p = 0.014). The proportion of patients with Stages A and D disease was similar in both age groups. The cumulative survival rate in this group at five and ten years was 43 and 34 per cent, respectively. The five year survival rate in patients less than 40 years old with Stage B disease was 76 per cent and with Stage C disease, 37 per cent. All young patients with Stage D disease were dead at 28 months. Synchronous and metachronous carcinomas of the colon and rectum were uncommon in patients less than 40 years old. Patients less than 40 years of age with carcinoma of the colon and rectum are usually symptomatic and have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Survival time for these patients for each stage of disease is similar to the over-all population of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum.\r"

However, some populations studied were not representative of those seen by most vascular surgeons. Accordingly, we examined two cohorts of patients at the Veterans Administration Medical Center using Duplex scanning. There were 153 volunteers in group 1, all more than 50 years of age, who were being treated at our outpatient department for nonvascular problems. There were 116 patients of similar age in group 2 but who were known to have significant arterial occlusive disease of the lower extremity. The majority of patients were men with a mean age of 64.4 years. Risk factors in the total population included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking. Over-all, significant (greater than 50 per cent diameter) stenosis of the carotid artery was discovered in 25 of 269 patients. The prevalence for those in group 1 was 6.5 per cent versus 12.9 per cent for those in group 2 (p = 0.058). The prevalence in patients with cardiac disease was 15.2 per cent compared with 6.8 per cent in those without cardiac disease (p = 0.032). Smoking was associated with a 10.6 per cent rate of significant disease compared with a 2.3 per cent rate in nonsmokers (p = 0.065). Hypertension and diabetes were not significant risk factors. Significant stenosis of the carotid artery was found in seven of 40 patients in whom coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and smoking were all present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Most oncologic surgeons agree that removal of the nipple, the areola and any recent scar at the site of the biopsy is necessary during a mastectomy for treatment of carcinoma of the breast. There is less agreement about what should be done with the remaining uninvolved mammary skin. Its preservation facilitates the performance of immediate reconstruction of the breast and can lead to improved aesthetic results, but many oncologists fear that this practice could lead to an increased incidence of local tumor recurrence. To determine if that fear was justified, 87 patients who had undergone unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for treatment of early carcinoma of the breast were studied. Preservation of uninvolved skin was used in all instances. All patients had a documented follow-up study of 12 months or more; the average follow-up time was 23.1 months. One peripheral local recurrence was observed. This 1.2 per cent rate of early local recurrence is lower than that reported from several series using modified radical mastectomy without skin preservation or immediate reconstruction, and suggests that skin preservation does not confer additional risks of local recurrence of carcinoma of the breast in properly selected patients.\r"

In 84 patients who still had stones at the time of the operation, the stones dissolved and disappeared within ten years in 88 per cent of those with urolithiasis and in 77 per cent with nephrocalcinosis. The rate of stone disappearance was similar in those with or without preoperative urinary tract infection and in patients operated upon for adenoma of the parathyroid gland or primary hyperplasia. This rate was slower for patients with a postoperative urinary infection. The frequency of renal colics, 0.66 per patient per year before parathyroidectomy, decreased to 0.02 per patient per year after the first postoperative year.\r"

Involvement of the lymph node and metastasis to the liver were not affected by LSI, whereas the rates of peritoneal dissemination and direct invasion to neighboring organs increased with an increase in LSI.

The results of gastrointestinal contrast studies suggested a malignant condition in 75 per cent, but findings were not specific for lymphoma. Endoscopic findings suggested a malignant process in 85 per cent, but the yield for biopsy was only 60 per cent. Of 28 patients undergoing operative exploration, 75 per cent were resectable. Nine patients received postresectional adjuvant therapy. Five had chemotherapy; three, radiotherapy, and one patient, a combination of the two. Primary nonsurgical treatment consisted of chemotherapy in 11, radiotherapy in two and combined therapy in one instance. Three of five recurrences were successfully treated. The five year survival rate was 65 per cent without significant differences between surgical and nonsurgical regimens. Those with tumors smaller than 7 centimeters had a five year survival rate of 100 per cent versus 50 per cent for larger neoplasms. Patients more than 60 years of age appeared to have a more favorable course after surgical therapy compared with those who had nonsurgical treatment. We concluded that endoscopy is a most useful, although limited diagnostic study and since no treatment program is obviously superior, the choice of therapy can be individualized accordingly.\r"

Unfortunately, some survivors are left with an insufficient amount of intestine and cannot be weaned from total parenteral nutrition. An isoperistaltic intestinal lengthening procedure was used to treat surgically two such infants with 25 centimeters of remaining small intestine and absent ileocecal valves. This surgical technique longitudinally divides the short, dilated small intestine into two smaller, parallel lumens that are anastomosed end to end. This procedure preserves all mucosa, prolongs transit time by doubling intestinal length and corrects the ineffective peristalsis by tapering the dilated intestine. The lengthening technique can be performed because of the anatomic division of the intestinal vasculature within two leaves of the mesentery. Longitudinal division between the two leaves maintains vasculature to each side of the intestine. The isoperistaltic intestinal lengthening procedure, as it was successfully applied to two infants, is described in detail.\r"

Ultrasonographic findings confirmed the diagnosis in 47 per cent of the patients. Other roentgenologic procedures were required in the remaining patients. Initially, therapy was conservative in all, and in 67 per cent of patients, no further intervention was necessary. Only 33 per cent required invasive measures; cystoscopic passage of an internal ureteral stent was the initial procedure of choice at our institution. Three of five patients who underwent invasive procedures had surgical intervention for relief of ureteral obstruction. Intensive care management was necessary for one of these three patients who had acute hemorrhage occur during the procedure. These data emphasize the need for the accurate diagnosis of urolithiasis during pregnancy. Ultrasonography was a valuable diagnostic technique, but a limited excretory urogram is safe and appropriate when there is uncertainty. Conservative management (hydration, analgesia and antibiotics as indicated) of obstructive uropathy was successful in the majority of instances. A specific clinical algorithm facilitated the successful management of patients necessitating operative intervention. Optimal management requires clinical suspicion and a precise diagnostic and therapeutic plan.\r"

The effect of closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal (48 hours postoperatively) of closed suction drains on formation of the seroma was evaluated prospectively in 37 patients. Thirty-three underwent modified radical mastectomy for invasive carcinoma while four underwent total mastectomy with a level 1 axillary dissection for multifocal intraductal carcinoma. Seromas occurred in three, all were minor, two required one aspiration only and one required two aspirations. Two were seromas of the lower flap while one was an axillary seroma. Except for one patient who had a wound hematoma develop, no other instances of morbidity were noted. Closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal of closed suction drains is associated with a low incidence of seroma formation after mastectomy. Use of this technique has important economic and clinical implications for patients who had mastectomy.\r"

Such patients require extensive resuscitative efforts; in particular, some benefit from rapid, massive normothermic fluid resuscitation. During an initial one year period, 153 of 730 patients required immediate operation and, of these, 33 required rapid infusion defined as greater than 5 liters per hour during the first hour. The over-all survival rate of those operated upon was 79 per cent. Encouraged by these data, the rapid infusor (Level 1 H-500) (Level 1, Technologies, Inc.) was modified to further increase normothermic fluid delivery to 500 milliliters per minute. Eleven of the subsequent 205 patients required rapid infusion. There was a statistically significant improvement in clinical flow rates, decrement in resuscitation times and unexpected survival. In particular, the latter group (nine survivors) included four who were clinically dead in the field or on arrival at the trauma center, or both. Rapid infusion of normothermic fluids may be of benefit not only in penetrating trauma but also more generally in the management of massive hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke, we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin, another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage, and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke, many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore, frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome.\r"

The antithrombin III activity was significantly decreased in the acute stage. The elevation of fibrinogen and plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex levels in the acute stage was significantly greater in patients with an infarct size greater than 10 mm2 compared to patients with an infarct size less than 10 mm2. We observed similar changes in patients with cerebral embolism.

In a review of 54 patients with angiographically documented severe bilateral carotid stenosis (less than or equal to 2 mm residual lumen) or occlusion, eight had symptoms suggesting vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Five patients were identified retrospectively, and the other three were evaluated prospectively. Symptoms included various combinations of hemodynamically mediated, transient bilateral motor, sensory, or visual impairment. Dysarthria, dysphagia, and diplopia were generally absent. Each patient also described additional symptoms compatible with transient hemispheric or retinal ischemia. The anatomic regions subserving the bilateral vertebrobasilar-like symptoms could be correlated with angiographically estimated arterial border zones in both hemispheres and may thus represent bilateral hemispheric border zone ischemia rather than brain stem ischemia. An intracranial steal need not be invoked.\r"

This flow separation phenomenon is caused by the geometry of the carotid bifurcation and the fluid dynamics of blood. We demonstrated the flow separation phenomenon on lateral-projection intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms in 99 of 100 carotid bifurcations. The mean duration of flow separation was 5.8 seconds, with values up to 14 seconds in normal carotid bifurcations. The presence of this flow separation phenomenon is almost independent of atherosclerotic lesions and is not correlated with cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the angiographic finding of a flow separation has no diagnostic value. However, our results refer to a factor that may be important in the genesis of atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation, namely the duration of the stay of blood and its components within the area of flow separation.\r"

Paired segments, one normal and the other de-endothelized by gentle rubbing, were mounted for isometric recording of tension in organ baths. In 11 normal segments, vasopressin produced concentration-dependent contractions with an EC50 of 7.0 X 10(-10) M. Removal of the endothelium from 12 segments did not significantly affect vasopressin-induced contractions. Vasopressin produced further contractions in arterial segments with (n = 4) or without (n = 5) endothelium precontracted with KCl. In segments precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha, acetylcholine choline caused relaxation only of those with endothelium. At 10(-8) M (n = 11), the vasopressin V-1 receptor antagonist d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP produced a 60-fold shift to the right of the control response curve for vasopressin. Increasing the concentration of the receptor antagonist to 10(-6) M (n = 7) further displaced the control curve in a parallel manner. These results indicate that vasopressin exerts a powerful constrictor action on isolated human cerebral arteries by direct stimulation of V-1 receptors located predominantly on smooth muscle cells. It appears that this contractile response is not modulated by the presence of an intact endothelial cell layer.\r"

The clinical features of these cases consisted of slowly progressive dementia, together with vascular risk factors such as hypertension and often a history of minor stroke, and characteristic white matter lesions on brain computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images. Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated no occlusive lesion in any patient. Both cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were markedly reduced in the white matter (54-77% of control values), and both were decreased in the parietal (73% of control), frontal (74-80%), and temporal (74-83%) cortices, where no abnormalities were detected by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that vascular dementia of the Binswanger type may be caused by disconnection between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures due to ischemic damage in the white matter.\r"

Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation.\r"

Alterations in arteriolar diameter were dependent on the concentration of cocaine applied. Cocaine dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid at concentrations of 10(-8) or 10(-7) M was without effect. Concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M produced dilation (4.9 +/- 1.5% [mean +/- SEM] and 5.9 +/- 2.0%, respectively) in large arterioles (greater than 100 microns) but no significant change in the diameter of small arterioles (less than 100 microns). A concentration of 10(-4) M dilated both large and small arterioles (20.3 +/- 3.1% and 12.0 +/- 7.1%, respectively). Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg i.v. propranolol blocked the increase in pial arteriolar diameter after application of 10(-4) M cocaine and produced significant vasoconstriction in small arterioles (-8.3 +/- 3.1%). Cocaine produces vasodilation of cat cerebral arterioles. This effect appears to be mediated, at least in part, by mechanisms that depend on stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

In normothermic (36 degrees C) gerbils, ischemia induced a severe loss of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons measured 7 days after ischemia (28.4 neurons/mm, n = 10; control density in 10 naive gerbils 262.1 neurons/mm) and a significant decrease in forebrain calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II autophosphorylation measured 2 hours after ischemia (12.9 fmol/min, n = 6; control phosphorylation in six naive gerbils 23.5 fmol/min). The effect of temperature on these indicators of ischemic damage was examined by adjusting intracerebral temperature before and during the ischemic insult. Hyperthermic (39 degrees C) gerbils showed almost complete loss of neurons in the CA1 region (3.0 neurons/mm, n = 11) and extension of neuronal death into the CA2, CA3, and CA4 regions. In addition, hyperthermia exacerbated ischemia-induced inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity (4.2 fmol/min, n = 6). Hypothermia (32 degrees C) protected against ischemia-induced CA1 pyramidal cell damage (257.0 neurons/mm, n = 20) and inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity (26.0 fmol/min, n = 6). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity may be a critical event in the development of ischemia-induced cell death.\r"

We produced cerebral aneurysms in 19 rats by unilaterally ligating the common carotid artery, inducing renal hypertension, and feeding beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate. The first noted change was the loss of folds protruding from the internal elastic lamina. Morphologic changes of the internal elastic lamina, considered to be primarily responsible for aneurysmal formation, occurred after the loss or disintegration of the elastic skeleton of first the intima, then the media. In large aneurysms with thick domes, we found proliferation of elastic lamellae that may reduce the risk of rupture. It seems probable that the complex elastic skeleton of the arterial wall may account for the mechanical properties of the artery and that growth of an aneurysm occurs due to disintegration of the elastic skeleton and not simply to rupture of the internal elastic lamina. We believe that such changes in the elastic skeleton are a property of the functional state of the cells that produce elastin.\r"

Ischemic damage was varied by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery at a point either proximal (n = 4) or distal (n = 4) to the lenticulostriate vessels. Proximal occlusion elevated the dialysate contents of all amino acids. The largest increases occurred for the potentially neurotoxic amino acids aspartate and glutamate and for taurine (800-2,800% of basal efflux). We observed smaller increases for the \"metabolic\" amino acids (280-580% of basal efflux). Distal occlusion did not affect amino acid efflux in the striatum, and release in the cortex was significantly lower than that following proximal occlusion. We compared release data with acute histopathologic outcome. Proximal occlusion resulted in a large volume of ischemic damage in the cortex and striatum (25-48% of hemispheric volume). A smaller volume of ischemic damage was noted following distal occlusion (0-21% of hemispheric volume). The volume of ischemic damage and the amount of amino acid release were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05).\r"

We investigated the effect of (S)-emopamil on the histopathologic consequences of global brain ischemia in anesthetized rats. Pretreated rats (n = 15) received 20 mg/kg i.p. (S)-emopamil 30 minutes before and 2 hours following 10 minutes of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion plus arterial hypotension (50 mm Hg). Quantitative cell counts following 3 days' survival revealed a marked loss of pyramidal neurons in all subsectors of the hippocampal CA1 area of untreated ischemic rats (n = 15). In contrast, in (S)-emopamil pretreated rats numbers of normal neurons were significantly higher, by 2.4-, 1.9-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in the medial, middle, and lateral subsectors of the CA1 area. For example, normal neuron counts in the medial CA1 subsector were 34 +/- 9 (mean +/- SEM) in untreated ischemic rats compared with 82 +/- 13 in (S)-emopamil pretreated rats (control nonischemic value [n = 5] 157 +/- 2). By semiquantitative grading, (S)-emopamil also decreased ischemic changes in the cerebral cortex. No significant effect of (S)-emopamil on ischemic injury was detected in rats treated beginning 30 minutes after the ischemic insult (n = 10). Thus, pretreatment with (S)-emopamil is beneficial in decreasing the severity of neuronal injury in global brain ischemia.\r"

The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Seven normal adult volunteers underwent intermittent photic stimulation at frequencies of 5-60 Hz while their posterior cerebral arteries were monitored using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Baseline measurements were obtained under conditions of total darkness, and sampling was also done during continuous illumination. Overall variation in mean flow velocity between complete darkness and continuous illumination was 9.8%, but the maximal change (expressed as percentage deviation from baseline) occurred consistently when stimulation was undertaken at frequencies of 10 (21%) and 20 (19%) Hz (p = 0.05). Frequencies higher than 20 Hz resulted in mean flow velocity variations that were not significantly different from that found during continuous illumination. The optimal frequency of intermittent visual stimulation required to induce measurable changes in posterior cerebral artery Doppler characteristics appears to be in the range 10-20 Hz.\r"

We describe five patients with incoordination and corticospinal tract signs in the limbs opposite a dorsolateral thalamic hemorrhage. In four patients the hemorrhage extended superiorly into the lateral ventricle, the adjacent paraventricular region, and the upper and medial parts of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Instead of cerebellar dysfunction, these patients exhibited directional errors of movement that improved distinctly when performed under visual guidance. We explain the incoordination on the basis of conscious deep sensory loss in the involved limbs. Perception of light touch, painful pinprick, and temperature were preserved in all patients. We use the term \"sensory ataxic hemiparesis\" to distinguish these patients from those with \"classic\" ataxic hemiparesis and cerebellar-like features, a distinction that may be important when planning functional rehabilitation.\r"

We attribute the facial palsy to a lesion of a supranuclear fiber bundle supplying the facial nucleus. The location of the lesions favors these fibers taking a separate course from the main pyramidal tract at the mid- to upper pontine level.\r"

Fetal hemoglobin interferes with polymerization of Hb S in vitro, but laboratory studies carried out with homogeneous hemoglobin solutions are inadequate models of events in vivo, because RBCs are heterogeneous in their MCHC and Hb F content. Studies of hemoglobin switching in sheep, in tissue culture, and then in baboons led to use of 5-azacytidine for induction of increased Hb F synthesis in SS patients. Drug trials were successful but the theory that led to them was not. An alternate theory, not without flaws, led to the use of hydroxyurea. Chronic administration of the drug can lead to very impressive increases in Hb F synthesis and apparent clinical benefit. It is not clear that such clinical benefit is real rather than a placebo effect. Nor is it entirely clear that all of the effect of hydroxyurea can be related to increased production of F cells and increased F/F cell. Controlled clinical trials and studies of the properties of RBCs from treated patients may answer those questions. It is also likely that they will not only raise still other questions but probably show that our current understanding of the biology and treatment of sickle cell disease is far from complete.\r"

  ".W": "Over the past decade it has become apparent that vitamin E is an essential nutrient for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the developing human nervous system, skeletal muscle, and the retina. The clinical and histologic resemblance of the human neuromuscular disorder associated with chronic fat and vitamin E malabsorption to that observed in experimental vitamin E-deficient animal models is striking. Because of chronic malabsorption of vitamin E, children with CF, chronic cholestasis, abetalipoproteinemia, and short bowel syndrome are at risk for the development of neurologic deficits caused by vitamin E deficiency. Correction of the vitamin E deficiency state prevents, reverses, or, at least, stabilizes the neurologic dysfunction in susceptible individuals. Advances in stable isotope technology permit study of the hepatic discrimination among the various stereoisomers and forms of vitamin E. Investigations into the cause of the primary form of vitamin E deficiency, the isolated vitamin E deficiency syndrome, promise to delineate the normal physiologic processes involved in absorption, transport, and tissue delivery of vitamin E. Studies in progress are addressing the optimal route and form of vitamin E therapy to be used in each predisposing condition. One major task remaining is to better define the mechanism by which vitamin E deficiency leads to neurologic injury.\r"

Any steroid that is anabolic is also androgenic. Anabolic steroids are fraught with numerous side effects, a few of which are potentially life threatening, and some of which are permanent. Most of the side effects are mild and reversible. Use of anabolic steroids in sports is as much a moral issue as a medical one. Drug testing has not been a very successful means to eradicate abuse in the sporting arena. Education alone is probably not the answer to stopping anabolic steroid abuse but is an essential first step in combating this problem. Use of anabolic steroids in athletes is a form of cheating, and use will likely continue, especially if the rewards for success in sports remain so high. Physicians should avoid condemning individuals who choose to use anabolic steroids and encourage discussion of use with their health providers.\r"

If the physician stops, reaches out, listens, and supports the parents, he or she can have a dramatic effect on the lives of these parents. In the same manner in which we started this paper, we close with a quotation from another parent who suffered a loss: Daughters may die, But why? For even daughters can't live with half a heart. Three days isn't much a life. But long enough to remember thin blue lips, uneven gasps in incubators, Racking breaths that cause a pain to those who watched. Long enough to remember I never held her Or felt her softness Or counted her toes. I didn't even know the color of her eyes. Dead paled hands not quite covered by the gown she Was to go home in. Moist earth smell. One small casket. And the tears. You see, I hold in my hand but souvenirs of an occasion. A sheet of paper filled with statistics, A certificate with smudged footprints, A tiny bracelet engraved \"Girl, Smith.\" You say that you are sorry That you know how I feel.

In infants and children with cardiomyopathies or with congenital heart disease for which no reasonable standard surgical alternative exists, heart transplantation offers the best hope for long-term survival. Most important, in those patients surviving heart transplantation, rehabilitation has been almost universally complete. Although the long-term prospects for pediatric heart transplant patients are still unknown, we have now accumulated sufficient experience in adults suggesting the potential for decades-long survival. Future improvements in diagnosis and treatment of rejection and prevention of the complications of immunosuppressive therapy will continue to improve the prospects for lifelong survival in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "91089915\r", 
  ".W": "Recurrent heritable childhood myoglobinuria is a potentially fatal entity (mortality up to 35%) in which prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical. Sixty childhood cases have been reported between 1910 to 1988, most with undiagnosed etiologies. We have studied an additional 40 cases referred to CPMC (1980-1988), suggesting that this condition is largely underdiagnosed or unreported. We have found important differences between the childhood and adult-onset cases. Of 77 cases of adult-onset recurrent myoglobinuria, 45% have been diagnosed biochemically. In contrast, only 30% of the 60 childhood cases from the literature have been diagnosed; 11 with CPT deficiency and 7 with various glycolytic defects, and only 5 of our 40 childhood cases have been diagnosed, all with CPT deficiency. The 100 combined childhood cases can be divided into an exertional group (type I) with exertion as the leading precipitating factor (46 literature and 10 CPMC cases), a toxic group (type II) with infection and/or fever as the primary precipitant (14 literature and 23 CPMC cases), and 7 undefined cases. The type I group resembles the adult-onset group in which exercise is also the leading precipitating factor. There is a slight female predominance (male/female = 1:1.3) in the toxic group vs. a marked male predominance in the exertional and adult groups (4:1). Only 4 of 37 cases (11%) of the toxic group are diagnosed (all with CPT deficiency) vs. 19 of 56 cases (34%) of the exertional group (12 CPT, 7 glycolytic) and 45% of the adult group. The toxic group is also differentiated by a higher mortality rate and by the presence of additional clinical features, including ictal bulbar signs (8 of 18), encephalopathy (4 of 19), and seizures (2 of 7), as well as persistent cardiac abnormalities, developmental delay (4 of 17), and dysmorphic features (2 of 9). These clinical characteristics clearly differentiate the childhood from the adult cases and suggest the presence of more generalized disease processes and different biochemical etiologies. A study of the heritable causes of myoglobinuria is important because identification of the biochemical defect may elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of the myoglobinuria and facilitate the development of rational treatment strategies aimed at circumventing or correcting the metabolic block.\r"

Maximal exercise tests were done at baseline and after placebo and beta-blockade phases. Blood for analysis was collected via indwelling brachial vein angiocatheters at baseline and during and after testing. Plasma potassium and magnesium levels increased at peak exercise with atenolol, propranolol, and placebo. There was no difference among groups in baseline recovery for magnesium (mean 28 minutes, range 24 to 30 minutes). Potassium levels returned to baseline more rapidly (compared with magnesium) in the placebo and atenolol groups (mean 10 minutes); however, recovery time was prolonged with propranolol (26 minutes) compared with placebo and atenolol (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, plasma magnesium and potassium levels increased significantly with maximal exercise and are unaffected by atenolol or propranolol beta-blockade. Propranolol, however (compared with atenolol and placebo), prolongs the time of return to baseline of plasma potassium after exercise.\r"

The effect of radiopaque contrast media on the excitation and detection of arterial fluorescence has not been previously reported. Accordingly, fluorescence emission spectra from human coronary artery necropsy specimens (n = 7) during excitation with pulsed excimer laser excitation (308 nm) was examined before and after the addition of three different contrast media, sodium and meglumine diatrizoate, sodium and meglumine ioxaglate, and iopamidol. A decrease in overall fluorescence intensity was observed at all wavelengths for each contrast agent examined. The decrease in intensity of fluorescence emission was more marked at wavelengths less than 410 nm than at wavelengths above 425 nm. Similar effects were observed for contrast media diluted with whole blood. Absorption spectra for all three contrast media demonstrated absorption in the ultraviolet centered around 240 nm. We conclude that preferential absorption in the ultraviolet range by contrast media interferes with the excitation and detection of laser-induced fluorescence; use of visible light excitation may obviate interference with laser-induced fluorescence analysis of plaque.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-three patients with angina who were undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization underwent cardiac pacing with simultaneous hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic evaluation to assess the effects of pacing-induced ischemic on mitral valve velocity. Seventeen patients had significant coronary artery disease, and six patients had normal coronary arteries. Doppler and hemodynamic measurements were performed at rest and immediately after pacing was discontinued to 91% +/- 7% of maximal predicted heart rate. Seven patients experienced new or significant increases in severity of mitral regurgitation after pacing as revealed by Doppler examination. This group had a significant increase (p = 0.007) in early but not in late peak filling velocities immediately after pacing was discontinued, with a resultant decrease in late to early ratios, which decreased from 1.01% +/- 0.12 to 0.70% +/- 0.19 (p = 0.006). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly from 16.7% +/- 6.8 mm Hg to 29.4% +/- 5.3 mm Hg after cardiac pacing (p less than 0.001). Patients with coronary disease who did not develop mitral regurgitation also had significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 18.7% +/- 5.8 mm Hg to 24.3% +/- 8.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). There were no changes in late or early wave amplitude, late to early ratio, or other Doppler measurements in any of the other groups. We conclude that mitral regurgitation caused by pacing-induced myocardial ischemia normalizes Doppler indices of mitral inflow, which in turn, may mask persistent or worsened left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\r"

Diffuse coronary disease was described as: group I, narrowing greater than or equal to 50% that involved the entire vessel (40 patients), group II, long lesions greater than or equal to 2 cm in length (39 patients), group III, three or more lesions in the same vessel (19 patients). There were 65 men and 33 women, with a mean age of 60 years; 64 patients (65%) had unstable angina, 23 patients (23%) were diabetic, 31 (32%) had prior myocardial infarctions, and 12 had prior bypass surgery. Multivessel disease was present in 89% of patients. Angioplasty of only the diffusely diseased vessel was performed in 41 patients, and additional vessels were dilated in 57 patients. Overall, of 396 lesions (four per patient) and 197 vessels (two per patient) attempted, success was achieved in 382 lesions (96%) and 187 vessels (95%); angiographic success was achieved in 112 of 120 diffusely diseased vessels (93%). Clinical success was achieved in 91 patients (93%). The overall complication rate (death, myocardial infarction, urgent bypass surgery) was 8% (8 of 98): six patients (6%) had myocardial infarction (one Q wave, five non-Q wave), one patient (1%) had urgent bypass surgery, and two patients (2%) died (one during bypass surgery). The majority of complications (7 of 8 or 87%), including the two deaths, occurred in group I patients, with a 17.5% rate, versus 2.5% in group II and 0% in group III, p less than 0.002.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the ability of Doppler echocardiography to identify hemodynamic changes due to cardiac medications, 10 volunteers underwent Doppler examination at rest and immediately following vigorous treadmill exercise. Upon completion of the control test, each subject received moderate oral doses of propranolol, verapamil, pindolol, or nifedipine, and the same exercise protocol was repeated. During four control tests, values for peak acceleration and flow velocity integral were similar for each subject at rest and exercise. Following propranolol and pindolol, resting acceleration fell by 4.5 and 2 m/sec2, respectively p less than 0.05. Resting acceleration was unchanged by verapamil and increased following nifedipine by 1.7 m/sec2 (p less than 0.0001), but neither verapamil nor nifedipine altered either Doppler parameter. Flow velocity integral was increased by nifedipine at rest and by each of the beta-blockers during exercise (p less than 0.05). We conclude that (1) rest and exercise Doppler measurements are stable and reproducible, given stable cardiovascular status; (2) pindolol produced less hemodynamic depression as measured by Doppler echocardiography at rest relative to propranolol, but showed similar potency at maximal exertion; (3) nifedipine enhanced global cardiac performance at rest, but neither calcium antagonist affected Doppler measurements during exercise; and (4) Doppler echocardiography is a useful, noninvasive technique for evaluating hemodynamic effects of medication at rest and during vigorous exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Although few studies have reported on relatively preserved ventricular function in patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy, the condition is usually believed to have the typical low-output congestive hemodynamic pattern of the dilated congestive cardiomyopathies. Two groups of patients, 14 with peripartum cardiomyopathy and 12 with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy who were matched for gender and age, were studied. They had normal blood pressure and similar New York Heart Association functional class, nutritional status, thyroid function and routine laboratory evaluation. All patients were catheterized during stable in-hospital compensation of heart failure, which was achieved by bed rest, sodium restriction, and administration of digoxin and diuretics long (more than 3 months) after delivery. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) between patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and those with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy were observed in regard to: (1) cardiac index: 3.34 +/- 1.36 L/min/m2 versus 2.24 +/- 0.72 L/min/m2, (2) systemic vascular resistance: 1713 +/- 567 dynes.sec.cm-5 versus 2194 +/- 603 dynes.sec.cm-5, (3) right ventricular stroke work index: 8.6 +/- 4.2 g.M/m2 versus 14.8 +/- 8.2 g.M/m2 in the peripartum cardiomyopathy and the dilated congestive cardiomyopathy groups, respectively. Three of the patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy had resting cardiac index values that were even higher than the normal upper limit for our laboratory (4.5 L/min/m2): 4.80, 5.70, and 5.63 L/min/m2. They also had nearly normal left ventricular ejection fractions: 0.68, 0.41, and 0.51, respectively. These results indicate that, unlike the common dilated cardiomyopathy, the hemodynamic pattern in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy is not homogeneous, and some patients have high-output failure and near normal left ventricular function.\r"

Among white adult men and women under the age of 60 without other cardiovascular disease risk factors, a dose-response relationship was found between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and increasing levels of plasma cholesterol. In men aged 18 to 60 years, average plasma cholesterol increased by 0.33 mg/dl for each cigarette smoked (p less than 0.001); in women aged 31 to 50 years, average plasma cholesterol increased by 0.48 mg/dl for each cigarette smoked (p less than 0.001). Plasma cholesterol levels among ex-smokers were found to be similar to those of nonsmokers. No association between cigarette smoking and levels of plasma cholesterol was observed in men and women over age 60. Possible mechanisms for this observed relationship include an antiestrogenic effect of cigarette smoking that makes the observation more noticeable in younger female cohorts, enhanced lipolysis that increases levels of plasma free fatty acids, or differences in dietary intake between smokers and nonsmokers.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of allopurinol on cardiac performance and early mortality after coronary bypass surgery. Allopurinol (n = 89) or placebo (n = 80) was administered to 169 patients before surgery. Randomization produced groups evenly matched for surgical risk factors. Hospital mortality rate in the placebo group was 14 of 80 (18%) in the allopurinol group 4 of 89 (4%), p = 0.014. Cardiac performance, scored by cardiac index and the need for ionotropic or mechanical support, was significantly better in the allopurinol group. More nonfatal complications occurred in the allopurinol group. When either a complication or death is termed an event, the proportion of events was equal in the two groups. No side effects were identified. We now administer allopurinol to all patients who are undergoing bypass surgery unless specifically contraindicated.\r"

In this study, 43 patients with unexplained hypotension or a new murmur in the periinfarct period were evaluated with conventional two-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler color flow imaging. The presence of a ventricular septal defect was confirmed by oximetry, ventriculography, operative repair, or autopsy in each case. Both two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging were 100% specific in excluding a ventricular septal defect. Doppler color flow imaging correctly identified the 12 confirmed ventricular septal defects in this study (100% sensitivity), whereas any combination of two-dimensional criteria only correctly identified seven (58% sensitive) (p less than 0.05). Doppler color flow imaging is superior to conventional two-dimensional imaging in the diagnosis of a postinfarction ventricular septal defect. In addition, Doppler color flow imaging localized the septal defect, and thus guided therapy and technique for repair. Carefully performed Doppler color flow examination can exclude or result in the rapid diagnosis of a ventricular septal defect, which eliminates the need for further time-consuming confirmatory testing.\r"

All had coronary angiography. Noncardiac side effects (26%), induced chest discomfort (44%), and ST segment changes (12%) were similar in the two groups. No significant arrhythmias occurred. Two patients had prolonged chest pain, both with extensive reversible image abnormalities and associated creatinine kinase-MB release. Both had elective bypass surgery. Twenty-eight patients had normal coronary arteries, and 35 had single-vessel disease. Scintigraphic per patient sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 79% with a per vessel sensitivity of 74% and a per vessel specificity of 78% without between-group differences. During a brief follow-up period, 62 patients with image abnormalities had coronary revascularization, and there were seven deaths without intergroup differences. In a similar patient group that did not have angiography, scintigraphic defects were less frequent and less extensive, revascularization was not performed, and subsequent deaths occurred less often. Dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy is an accurate alternative to exercise testing in the evaluation of patients with unstable angina pectoris. Although not without risk, the method appears relatively safe and should be considered as a guide to diagnosis, and probably to prognosis and management.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the usefulness of a sustained intravenous infusion of nifedipine and a combination of nifedipine and metoprolol in the early management of 14 patients with unstable angina pectoris. After a 24-hour run-in period, nifedipine was titrated in a stepwise fashion (mean dose 27 +/- 7 micrograms/min). After nifedipine treatment coronary blood flow increased from 150 +/- 66 to 183 +/- 74 ml/min (p less than 0.05), whereas double product, myocardial oxygen consumption, and both arterial and coronary sinus (nor)epinephrine levels were unchanged. Myocardial lactate uptake increased from 3.4 +/- 26.1 to 31.3 +/- 26.6 mumol/min (p less than 0.005) and free fatty acid uptake from 7.2 +/- 22.1 to 34.5 +/- 33.7 mumol/min (p less than 0.05). A small nonsignificant improvement in amino acid metabolism was observed. Metoprolol was added in seven patients and led to a decrease in double product (-2.2 +/- 1.6 x 10(3); p less than 0.01) and myocardial oxygen consumption (-3.2 +/- 3.8 ml/min; p less than 0.05). The lactate uptake/oxygen uptake ratio increased by 18% after metoprolol (p = NS). The number of episodes of chest pain decreased from 2.4 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.1 +/- 0.2 in the nifedipine group and from 2.9 +/- 1.1/24 hours to 0.3 +/- 0.5 in the nifedipine plus metoprolol group (both p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the acute phase of unstable angina, intravenous nifedipine can be carefully titrated to improve coronary blood flow and oxidative metabolism. The addition of metoprolol is also associated with a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. This treatment results in significant hemodynamic stability.\r"

Among 23 patients (19%), acute ST segment elevations amounted to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mV (mean +/- SD) and occurred after 243 +/- 114 joules (cumulative dose) in the precordial leads only in 14, concomitantly in precordial and inferior leads in two, and in the precordial and anterolateral leads in seven. They normalized within 1.5 +/- 0.8 minutes. Occurrence of ST segment elevation was related to previous pericardiotomy (p less than 0.00001) and age (p = 0.01). Estimation of myocardial enzyme release did not show evidence of myocardial damage. Patients with ST segment elevations had a lower conversion rate (48% versus 76%, p = 0.005). Long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm was also diminished (35% versus 59%, p = 0.03). Results of this study show that postcardioversion ST segment elevation occurs predominantly in postpericardiotomy patients and may be associated with an unfavorable arrhythmia prognosis.\r"

In four of the six cases, when the DP was arbitrarily designated D1 and D2, D1 and D2 showed progressive fusion during ODP. In addition, the D1 return cycle, immediately after the termination of ODP, corresponded to the AF cycle, and the D2 return cycle corresponded to the pacing cycle. This may indicate that the DP is caused by the collision of two directional waves. Furthermore, it is suggested that the HRA plays an important role in preventing a possible shortcutting of reentry waves and in stabilizing the reentry circuit of AF.\r"

In 25 patients with transient AF, the response of the atrial activity width to extrastimuli was examined in comparison with 25 patients without AF to see if the results could be used as an index of subsequent occurrence of AF. Programmed electrical stimulation using eight basic stimuli followed by single or double extrastimuli (P1P2 or P1P2P3) were delivered to the high right atrium, and the atrial activities were examined. The prolongation of the atrial activity caused by extrastimuli was termed fragmentation (Frg), and it was defined as the prolongation of more than 150% of the basic stimuli. Frg zone was defined as the zone of coupling intervals of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3) that caused Frg, and delta max Frg was defined as the difference between the widest Frg and the atrial wave width during basic stimuli. Fragmentation was reproducibly induced by extrastimuli, and there was an inverse relationship between Frg duration and the coupling interval of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3). Frg zone and delta max Frg were wider and longer in patients with transient AF in comparison with the control group for both single and double extrastimuli (p less than 0.001). AF inducibility using double extrastimuli was significantly high in patients with AF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The short-to-long protocol uses a train of eight stimuli at a short cycle length and up to two extrastimuli. The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter. Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both. The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol. In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT. Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol. However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT. All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53 +/- 14%. During the follow-up period of 24 +/- 16 months, actuarial survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 95% and 89% for sudden death and 95% and 83% for total cardiac death, respectively. No patients with a known ejection fraction greater than 30% died suddenly during the follow-up. Noninducibility by programmed stimulation in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation is associated with a relatively preserved ventricular function. It may predict a low risk of sudden death in patients with preserved ventricular function.\r"

Univariate analysis identified the following variables: age, + signal-averaged ECG (SAECG), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and history of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) on Holter; multivariate analysis identified +SAECG, LVEF, and history of SMVT as risk factors for induction of SMVT at EPS. All patients were followed up for 19.0 +/- 8.3 months and 17 had recurrence of syncope. Patients were divided into empiric, EP-guided, and no therapy groups. The EP-guided therapy group included all patients with SMVT at EPS. Recurrence rates among all three groups were similar. We conclude that: (1) Patients who have inducible SMVT at EPS can be identified using certain clinical and noninvasive variables. When these patients undergo EP-guided therapy, their rate of recurrence of syncope becomes compatible with that of patients who had no arrhythmia induced at EPS. (2) Empiric therapy does not offer any benefit over no therapy in reducing the rate of recurrent of scope.\r"

  ".W": "The antiarrhythmic efficacy of intravenously administered amiodarone was examined in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study that involved 77 patients after coronary artery bypass surgery. Amiodarone was given after surgery in a loading bolus of 300 mg for 2 hours followed by 1200 mg every 24 hours for 2 days and 900 mg every 24 hours for the next 2 days. Amiodarone suppressed both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias within 12 hours after the start of therapy. Particularly, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (5% vs 21% in the control group; p less than 0.05) and of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3% vs 16%; p less than 0.05) was reduced by amiodarone. Heart rate was slowed (p less than 0.001) and repolarization--as judged by JTc interval--was prolonged compared with the control group (p less than 0.01). In two patients, amiodarone infusion was stopped because of excessive QTc prolongation. No detrimental hemodynamic effects of the drug were observed. Thus the intravenous administration of amiodarone appears to be suitable for patients in whom rapid suppression of symptomatic supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is warranted in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of various pacing and pharmacologic techniques to uncover VA conduction during apparent unidirectional VA block, and to evaluate the role of several biologic and electrophysiologic factors in concealment of retrograde conduction. Forty healthy dogs underwent catheter-electrophysiologic studies of AV and VA conduction. Group I (20 animals) had intact VA conduction. Group II (six animals) had VA dissociation with ventricular pacing initiated during sinus rhythm, but the presence of VA conduction was confirmed by isoproterenol infusion or by premature ventricular stimulation. In group III (14 animals), the above techniques failed to uncover VA conduction. Eight of 14 group III animals underwent thoracotomy and crushing or freezing of the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ventricular pacing initiated during sinus standstill was associated with 1:1 VA conduction in each experiment. VA conduction time and retrograde Wenckebach cycle length, both in the baseline state and during isoproterenol infusion, were significantly longer in the eight animals in group III than in those in group I. Age, gender, weight, breed, sinus cycle length, and anterograde AV conduction properties were not significantly different between groups I, II, and III. The data suggest that (1) in normal dogs, complete unidirectional VA block probably does not exist; (2) in the presence of anterograde input to the AV node, even sophisticated pacing and pharmacologic maneuvers may fail to uncover the presence of VA conduction; (3) although anterograde input is essential for concealment of VA conduction, the phenomenon is more closely associated with depressed retrograde than with anterograde AV nodal characteristics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rather than suggesting that elevated blood pressure and CHD are not causally related, these data suggest that the antihypertensive agents used were not optimal for the management of hypertension and a review of the currently recommended therapies is needed. Major risk factors for CHD, which include increased blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol levels, and smoking, are highly prevalent in the general population and appear to cluster in patients with hypertension. Therefore the treatment of hypertension demands a multifactorial approach, one that takes into consideration all the risk factors for CHD. Diuretics and beta-blockers adversely affect the serum lipid profile, and this could negate some of the CHD benefit afforded by blood pressure reduction.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of antihypertensive treatment must be not only the reduction of high blood pressure, but also the effective management of elevated cholesterol levels and other risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD). In controlled clinical trials, doxazosin has been shown to have antihypertensive efficacy comparable with other classes of antihypertensive agents and to lower the levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides while increasing the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Doxazosin appears to inhibit the development of CHD on two fronts. First, doxazosin binds to the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor and inhibits the receptor-mediated responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine. Second, doxazosin has direct and indirect effects on lipid metabolism by increasing LDL receptor activity, decreasing intracellular LDL synthesis, reducing the synthesis and secretion of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and stimulating lipoprotein lipase activity. Doxazosin may also inhibit platelet aggregation. Long-term studies will determine how these actions translate into reductions in the morbidity and mortality rates of CHD. First-year results from the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) have demonstrated expected reductions in blood pressure for all antihypertensive agents studied. The lipid changes have varied with the type of antihypertensive treatment and have been favorable for doxazosin.\r"

The mean daily dose in patients considered a therapy success was 2.8 mg.

Doxazosin (mean dose at 3 years, 5.2 mg/day) and atenolol (mean dose, 66.4 mg/day) produced a sustained and overall similar reduction in blood pressure, with no evidence of tolerance. Doxazosin decreased mean blood pressure from 158/104 mm Hg to 146/90 mm Hg; with atenolol the decrease was from 160/103 mm Hg to 144/88 mm Hg. Whereas the reduction in blood pressure with atenolol was paralleled by a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in heart rate (from a mean of 74 to 60 beats/min), doxazosin produced no clinically meaningful changes in heart rate. In contrast to atenolol, doxazosin reduced triglyceride levels by -5.9% (atenolol +22.5%), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by +3.7% (atenolol, -11.2%), and increased the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio by +5.9% (atenolol, -10.3%); all of these values were significantly (p less than 0.001) different from those of atenolol-treated patients. Doxazosin also reduced the calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by -3.3% (atenolol, unchanged). The adverse effect of atenolol on lipid levels apparently negated any beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction, because the calculated coronary heart disease (CHD) risk actually increased significantly. In contrast, the reduction in calculated CHD risk in the doxazosin group was statistically significant at all points during the study. The safety profile of the drugs was similar. With the added potential of the reduction in the calculated risk of CHD among hypertensive patients,doxazosin represents an appropriate first-line drug for the treatment of essential hypertension.\r"

Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models.

At the final visit, doxazosin produced a mean change in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure of -18.4/-14.4 mm Hg, at a mean daily dose of 4.3 mg. One hundred sixty-three (77.6%) of the 210 evaluable patients were considered a therapeutic success. Lipid analyses identified a statistically significant (p = 0.02) reduction in total serum cholesterol (4.85%) and an overall decrease in triglyceride levels (5.12%). According to the Framingham Heart Study equation, doxazosin produced a highly significant (p less than 0.001) 20% reduction in the calculated probability of developing coronary heart disease in 10 years. Of the 220 patients evaluated, 54 (24.5%) reported side effects that were considered related to treatment. Ten (4.5%) patients reported side effects unrelated to treatment and 37 (16.8%) reported events of unknown relationship. Most side effects were mild or moderate and were tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment. Nine patients (4.1%) were discontinued from therapy and in 13 (5.9%) the dose was reduced. The most prevalent side effects were headache and dizziness. The investigator's overall assessment of antihypertensive efficacy was excellent or good for 176 patients (80.4%); tolerance was considered excellent or good in 193 patients (88.5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results show that doxazosin has an antihypertensive effect that is dose dependent. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were decreased significantly, and no effect on heart rate was observed. Doxazosin significantly inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment with doxazosin lowered total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, without changing other standard biochemical parameters.

The reduction of dioxygen to water involves several active intermediates. The control of this depends on the integrity of an enzymatic system that requires adequate intake of selenium, copper, zinc, and manganese; if their level of intake is low, proliferation of active oxygen metabolites may occur. Targets for attack are DNA, proteins, and polyunsaturated phospholipids. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids will result in disruption of membrane architecture. Vitamin E, perhaps with ascorbic acid, can prevent this, and vitamin A and beta-carotene also intervene. The implication of this in the etiology of a number of diseases depends on theory and on evidence linking low intake of the antioxidant nutrients with a high disease incidence. Improvements in epidemiology have resulted in glimpses into what may prove to be links between diet and disease.\r"

These potentially deleterious reactions are controlled by a system of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants which eliminate prooxidants and scavenge free radicals. The ability of the lipid-soluble carotenoids to quench singlet molecular oxygen may explain some anticancer properties of the carotenoids, independent of their provitamin A activity. Tocopherols are the most abundant and efficient scavengers of hydroperoxyl radicals in biological membranes. Water-soluble antioxidants include ascorbate and cellular thiols. Glutathione is an important substrate for enzymatic antioxidant functions and is capable of nonenzymatic radical scavenging. Thiols associated with membrane proteins may also be important to the antioxidant systems. Interactions between the thiols, tocopherols, and other compounds enhance the effectiveness of cellular antioxidant defense.\r"

It was found that the in vitro oxidations of erythrocyte membranes proceed by a chain mechanism with a long kinetic chain length. Thus, the role of chain-breaking antioxidants is quite important, since they scavenge chain-carrying radicals to break a chain reaction. In fact, it has been found experimentally that vitamin E, a lipophilic chain-breaking antioxidant present within the membranes, suppresses the oxidative damage of the membranes more efficiently than water-soluble chain-breaking antioxidants such as vitamin C, which scavenges aqueous radicals but can not scavenge chain-carrying radicals within the membranes.\r"

The accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages is explained by the uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL). An in vivo modification of lipoproteins might be oxidation. The oxidized LDL showed several chemicophysical modifications. The first demonstrated effect of LDL oxidation was its increased susceptibility to uptake by cultured macrophages. Furthermore, oxidized LDL exhibits a chemotactic activity, and a cytotoxicity. An hypothesis that explains the appearance and development of atherosclerotic lesions and is based on obtained in vitro is exposed. LDL-like lipoproteins extracted from human aorta had some of properties of oxidized LDL, such as the recognition of materials present in atheroma by antibodies against oxidized LDL and the presence of autoantibodies against oxidized LDL in human sera are in favor of the pathogenetically important role of the oxidation of LDL.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the relationship among vitamin E, oxygen radicals, and lipid peroxidation in ischemia-reperfusion, we produced an experimental model of gastric mucosal injury in rats by ischemia-reperfusion with clamping of the celiac artery and measurements of the area of gastric erosion, thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive substances, and alpha-tocopherol in serum and gastric mucosa during ischemia-reperfusion. The area of gastric erosions and TBA-reactive substances in gastric mucosa were significantly increased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. The serum alpha-tocopherol-cholesterol ratio and gastric mucosal alpha-tocopherol were significantly decreased after 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. On the other hand, in vitamin E-deficient rats, gastric mucosal injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion was more severe than that in vitamin E-nondeficient rats. These results indicate that vitamin E is consumed in the process of lipid peroxidation induced by oxygen radicals in ischemia-reperfusion to prevent the development of tissue damage.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years there has been considerable interest concerning the role of oxygen radicals in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury. The sequential univalent reduction of oxygen gives rise to very reactive intermediate products. Normally, the tissue concentration of these intermediate products of oxygen is limited and the aerobic myocardium survives because of the existence of a delicate balance between the generation of the various oxidants and the maintenance of the antioxidant defense mechanism. Several possible sources have been identified for the production of active oxygen species after ischemia and reperfusion and these sources may be mutually interactive. The ability of scavengers of oxygen free radicals, including vitamin E, to improve mechanical, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic reticulum function in animal models of ischemic-reperfusion injury also suggests that oxygen free radicals are partly responsible for myocardial damage in these models, although caution in the interpretation of these data is necessary.\r"

Importantly, in virtually all situations regular intake of fruits and vegetables appreciably lowers the risk of cancer. This paper reviews the causes of the main human cancers and analyzes the mechanisms of the protective effects of fruits and vegetables. Prevention of human cancer requires the definition of optimal levels of recommended daily allowances of micronutrients.\r"

Nitrite can be formed in vivo via bacterial reduction of nitrate and by activated macrophages and endothelial cells. The mechanism of nitrite formation by mammalian cells is via enzymatic oxidation of arginine to NO followed by oxidation to N2O3 and N2O4. Nitrosatable amines are found in many foods and some, eg, dimethylamine, are synthesized in the body. Precursors of N-nitroso compounds are thus almost constantly present together under favorable reaction conditions in vivo and there is, consequently, considerable interest concerning possible human health risks arising from endogenous formation of this class of compounds. Among many nitrosation inhibitors, most attention has focused on ascorbic acid, which reacts with many nitrosating agents and which is virtually nontoxic. This presentation discusses the chemistry of ascorbic acid inhibition of nitrosation reactions.\r"

In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer. The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective. Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A. However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored. Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix. But because of fewer studies and less consistency among studies, the epidemiologic evidence is at present less persuasive than for lung cancer.\r"

Nine sites have been studied: colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, melanoma, basal cell of skin, breast, prostate, and bladder. Serum beta-carotene levels showed a strong protective association with lung cancer, suggestive protective associations with melanoma and bladder cancer, and a suggestive but nonprotective association with rectal cancer. Serum vitamin E levels had a protective association with lung cancer; none of the other sites showed impressive associations. Low levels of serum lycopene were strongly associated with pancreatic cancer and less strongly associated with cancer of the bladder and rectum.\r"

We found significantly lower mean carotene levels for all cancer, bronchus cancer, and stomach cancer (all P less than 0.01) compared with the 2421 survivors. The relative risk of subjects with low carotene (less than 0.23 mumol/L) was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) for lung cancer (Cox's model). Higher risks were noted for all cancer (P less than 0.01) if both carotene and retinol were low. Low plasma carotene which is known to reflect carotene intake is in our study associated with increased cancer risk.\r"

Of the 46 such studies in which a dietary vitamin C index was calculated, 33 found statistically significant protection, with high intake conferring approximately a twofold protective effect compared with low intake. Of 29 additional studies that assessed fruit intake, 21 found significant protection. For cancers of the esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, and pancreas, evidence for a protective effect of vitamin C or some component in fruit is strong and consistent. For cancers of the stomach, rectum, breast, and cervix there is also strong evidence. Several recent lung cancer studies found significant protective effects of vitamin C or of foods that are better sources of vitamin C than of beta-carotene. It is likely that ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and other factors in fruits and vegetables act jointly. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables in general should be encouraged.\r"

The levels of serum alpha-tocopherol were determined from stored serum samples (at -20 degrees C) taken from these cancer patients and from 1419 matched control subjects. Individuals with a low level of alpha-tocopherol had about a 1.5-fold risk of cancer compared with those with a higher level. The strength of the association between serum alpha-tocopherol level and cancer risk varied for different cancer sites and was strongest for some gastrointestinal cancers and for the combined group of cancers unrelated to smoking. The association was strongest among nonsmoking men and among women with low levels of serum selenium. The findings agree with the hypothesis that dietary vitamin E in some circumstances protects against cancer.\r"

However, until recently there have been no measurements of gastric juice ascorbic acid concentrations. We have measured both gastric juice ascorbic and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid). Our findings suggest that ascorbic acid is secreted into the gastric lumen so that gastric juice concentrations are often greater than those in plasma. Gastric pathology affects this secretion, leading to values in gastric juice that are lower than plasma levels. Stimulation of gastric secretion does not raise vitamin C concentrations in individuals whose values are initially low. The role of ascorbic acid in preventing formation of NOC and protecting against gastric cancer is discussed in the light of these findings.\r"

Animal experiments have shown that these compounds can inhibit cancer formation. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of retinoids to reverse oral leukoplakia. However, toxicities associated with retinoids at the doses used in these studies limits their potential for chemoprevention. Because of its lack of toxicity, beta-carotene is a very attractive agent for chemoprevention. It suppresses micronuclei in exfoliated oral mucosal cells from subjects at risk for oral cancer and recently has been shown to be active in reversing leukoplakia. Another area under investigation is the possibility of preventing second primary tumors in patients cured of their initial cancer who have an increased risk of developing new cancers of the upper acrodigestive tract.\r"

Vitamin A completely suppressed and beta-carotene suppressed by 50% formation of new leukoplakia within the 6-mo trial period. After withdrawal of vitamin A or beta-carotene treatment, oral leukoplakias reappeared, frequency of micronuclei in oral mucosa increased, and nuclear textures reverted to those present before the administration of chemo-preventive agents.
