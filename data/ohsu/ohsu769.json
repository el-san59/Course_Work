  ".W": "Models of alcohol input and absorption are crucial to the description and understanding of the effects of alcohol in the human body. In this paper, the pharmacokinetics of alcohol after oral administration are described by a three-compartment model with a supposed concentration-dependent absorption and elimination. The absorption of alcohol from the small intestine into the blood is represented by a first-order rate constant ka. To describe the delay in peak concentration of alcohol the gastric emptying rate is represented as a first-order parameter with a feedback control depending on the amount of alcohol remaining in the stomach. The alcohol ingestion can then be represented as a bolus input. The elimination process is described by a model similar to the Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinetics. Parameters are estimated by means of an iterative algorithm minimizing a non-linear function. A good fit of the model was obtained for blood alcohol curves from six men and six women who each had received an alcohol dose of 28.5 g on three consecutive days. It is concluded that the model can be recommended to describe adequately the absorption and elimination of alcohol.\r"

Sufficient data for estimating the daily alcohol dose were obtained in 61 (64%) of the cases. Of these men, 21 (34%) were reported to drink at least an average of 80 g of alcohol daily. The validity of post-mortem alcohol reports was assessed by comparing the occurrence of alcohol-related diseases, toxicological data as well as the cause and manner of death with the reported alcohol consumption. Men whose reported daily alcohol consumption exceeded 80 g (mean 230 g) differed from men reported to drink less than 10 g (mean 3 g) in their more common incidence of positive post-mortem alcohol test (P less than 0.0005), fatty liver (P less than 0.001), enlarged liver (P less than 0.01), alcoholic hepatitis (P less than 0.05), chronic pancreatitis (P less than 0.01), and in their lower rate of death from cardiovascular diseases (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that interviews with relatives or friends provide reliable data on the drinking behaviour of the deceased. At autopsy, the most sensitive tests coinciding with high consumption of alcohol in post-mortem alcohol reports but not with each other were positive post-mortem blood alcohol and the occurrence of fatty liver.\r"

Compared to saline, both doses of scopolamine and methscopolamine induced a significant reduction in ethanol consumption in the P line of rats, and both antimuscarinic agents significantly increased water intake. Thus, ethanol preference was dramatically reduced in these rats. In contrast, scopolamine had relatively little effect on either ethanol or water intake in the NP line of rats, while methscopolamine tended to suppress both ethanol and water intake. These findings suggest that peripheral muscarinic mechanisms may be involved in ethanol preference in P rats.\r"

These experiments demonstrate growth inhibition by ethanol, and both adaptive and non-adaptive growth responses after chronic exposure. Examination of the cell cycle compartmentation of HTC lines shows that a rapid accumulation of G0/G1 cells is induced by ethanol. Estimates of cellular G1 RNA content by flow cytometry reveal increases in mean G1 RNA and in late G1 cells in the line which growth adapts, and decreases in these parameters in a line which does not adapt to ethanol. Both the growth responses and the timing of cell cycle restriction by ethanol in the adapting line suggest parallels with the reported data for regenerating rat liver. Ethanol induced late G1 restriction appears to be of significant interest in the study of cellular mechanisms which are disturbed by ethanol in proliferating tissues.\r"

Alcohol treatment increased urinary excretion of total GAGs, heparan sulfate and protein only in nondiabetic CBL but not in diabetic mice. Also, alcohol increased creatinine clearance only in CBL mice. The reason for the lack of effect of alcohol in diabetic mice is unknown. A significant positive linear relationship was found between urinary total GAG and protein concentrations. Possible significance of this relationship in diabetes is discussed.\r"

Permanent cannulae for intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion were implanted bilaterally in rats following standard stereotaxic procedures. Following post-operative recovery, either verapamil or artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) was infused i.c.v., followed by 4.0 g/kg ethanol in saline administered by intragastric gavage. Changes in body temperature and overall activity were monitored. In another series of experiments, rats were given either i.c.v. verapamil or ACSF followed by 1.5 g/kg intraperitoneal ethanol. Ability to turn over and open-field activity were monitored. In addition, to investigate the action of verapamil alone on body temperature, rats were infused i.c.v. either with verapamil or control ACSF, followed by intragastric administration of a volume of saline equal to 4.0 g/kg ethanol (20% v/v). At an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C, verapamil, infused prior to ethanol administration, significantly and rapidly attenuated the thermolytic action of ethanol. Central administration of verapamil alone did not induce a significant change in body temperature until more than 1.5 hr after injection, at which time temperature began to gradually increase. Pretreatment with verapamil induced significantly faster recovery from ethanol-induced changes in overall activity. Only a non-significant reversal of ethanol's effects on open-field activity and time taken to turn over occurred. These results demonstrate that verapamil can significantly antagonize ethanol-induced hypothermia and possibly motor disturbances in rats, leading us to postulate the possible involvement of neuronal Ca2+ channels in these effects of ethanol.\r"

The FSL hypercholinergic rats exhibited a significantly greater degree of hypothermia than the FRL rats, or a group of weight-matched randomly bred rats. Although there were some trends for the FSL rats to appear more depressed behaviorally after receiving ethanol, there were no significant differences between the FSL and FRL rats on quantitative behavioral measures. Blood ethanol concentrations were slightly lower in the FRL rats, but there were no differences between the FSL and control rats. These findings suggest an association between cholinergic mechanisms and ethanol sensitivity with regard to body temperature effect, but a direct causal relationship cannot be established because of similar differential sensitivities of FSL and FRL rats to a range of other neurotransmitter-altering drugs on this parameter.\r"

Plenum Press, New York) is an important assessment instrument for use in the treatment of alcoholism and particularly in relapse prevention. The SCQ was translated into Swedish and tested on 91 alcohol-dependent patients. A principal component analysis of the item responses resulted in a shortened 35-item version of the SCQ with satisfactory test-retest reliability, internal consistency and scale specificity. Instead of eight relapse situation categories the analysis resulted in four categories with lower intercorrelations than in the original SCQ. The components were: (1) unpleasant emotions; (2) social pressure; (3) testing personal control; and (4) positive emotional states. In a one-way ANOVA only the Social Pressure scale had a significant relationship with severity of alcohol problems.\r"

In addition, the unimpaired Older Americans Resource and Services (OARS) objective summary ratings for physical status and activities of daily living (ADL) were associated with severe drinking.

These criticisms concern the complexity of the health care system; the difficulty of integrating advances in science and technology into medicine; ethics; the doctor-patient relationship; and the importance of the individual student. Several medical schools use innovative curricula and organization in responding to these concerns, and other schools should study the assessments of these efforts and borrow anything useful. The problems of cost, access, and quality of care in the U.S. system are not primarily the fault of academic medicine and cannot be solved readily by it, but medical education can contribute to the solutions by preparing students to engage the problems.\r"

Inadequate access to health care services, perpetuated by the high cost of health care, is part of the problem. The author analyzes many legislative and administrative steps that have been taken to address these issues, and many more that should be carefully examined. More emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention is vital. Another solution is to further enhance the biomedical research enterprise and work to prepare the regulatory system to quickly, safely, and effectively infuse this knowledge into the health care delivery system. Another solution is for physicians to be adequately prepared for this practice of medicine in the years to come.\r"

The dropout rate among high school students, and the high and increasing rate of functional illiteracy, blight lives and represent an enormous economic loss to the nation. American education must be restructured at all levels so that local and federal funds can be used flexibly to pursue revised educational goals. Students and their families should be allowed to choose their elementary and secondary schools, and school management should be decentralized and more rooted in the community. The medical profession must become involved in elementary and secondary education, and medical faculty must be involved in their communities. Further, medical faculty must encourage minority students at all educational levels, must recruit minority medical students, and must increase the number of minority faculty members.\r"

  ".W": "The National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) was established in the early 1950s to bring order and fairness to a previously chaotic application process for internship and residency positions. Over the years many reservations were raised about the fairness of the process, specifically, that hospital programs are doing better than students are (i.e., programs obtain preferred residents more often than students receive preferred programs). This paper presents an analysis of the results of the 1986 Match. The findings do not support the claim that the results of the Match are biased in a way that favors programs. Overall, the students' success was greater (i.e., receiving on average higher-ranked choices) than was the hospital programs' success. In fact, in 20 of 22 specialty programs, the students' degree of success was greater than or equal to the success of the programs. This finding raises the question of fairness toward programs rather than students. The authors analyze factors that affected both the hospitals' and the students' degrees of success in the 1986 Match and suggest strategies for improving the Match results.\r"

  ".W": "The authors evaluated the reliability of the proposal review process used by a faculty-student committee to choose medical student researchers for summer fellowships. A total of 82 proposals were reviewed by the committee over a two-year period (43 in 1987 and 39 in 1988); the proposals were assigned ratings in the spring of each year. The 39 students whose proposals received the highest ratings over the two-year period received fellowships and carried out their projects during ten weeks in the summer of each year. In December of both years, the research fellows, along with a total of 12 students whose proposals had been rejected by the program over the two-year period but who had received support from other programs, presented their findings. These research presentations were also judged and rated, and the ratings of all the presentations were compared with the student committee's original ratings of the research proposals. A significant correlation was found between both years' sets of ratings for the proposals and the research presentations. The \"accepted\" students generally received higher ratings on their presentations than did the \"rejected\" students; however, the mean of the ratings received by the \"accepted\" students for their presentations was not significantly higher than that received by the \"rejected\" students. Even so, the significant correlation between each year's set of ratings for all the students involved demonstrates the soundness of the review process.\r"

All these variables affect the duration--but not necessarily the quality--of training that residents actually experience. The data show that these variables demonstrated wide ranges that depended on the postgraduate year of training, the discipline, the program size, and the program type (university, university-affiliated, freestanding, or military). The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, training program directors, and the American Board of Pediatrics and the American Board of Internal Medicine each need to consider these variables in making their respective decisions about accrediting training programs, verifying the clinical competence of trainees, and certifying program graduates.\r"

The 71 responding graduates (from a total of 112) reported patient care as their major involvement (mean of 42.9 hours per week), with a majority (83%) seeing patients in both pediatric and adult age groups. Most were involved in primary care only (64%). The graduates reported that during both pediatrics and internal medicine training, they had had too many inpatient and intensive care rotations and too few elective and ambulatory rotations. The most important subspecialty rotations in internal medicine were considered to be cardiology, dermatology, and pulmonary medicine; and in pediatrics, infectious disease, cardiology, and adolescent medicine. The graduates recommended more outpatient subspecialty rotations, ambulatory rotations in medicine and pediatrics, and a combined medicine-pediatrics continuity clinic.\r"

Each surgeon's taped behavior was scored at three time intervals by two behavioral scientists using the BUISE method, an interpersonal rating scale for surgeons developed by the authors, and independently scored by a third independent researcher using the Stillman scale. The correlation results demonstrated that the quality of communication competency of these surgeons varied during the three time intervals in which their behavior was evaluated. The Brown University Interpersonal Skill Evaluation (BUISE) instrument was found to be sensitive to the variation of a surgeons' interpersonal skill throughout an entire interview, whereas the Stillman scale correlated with the surgeons' behavior at the end of the interview only.\r"

  ".U": "90241524\r", 
  ".W": "Since the area at risk for necrosis is the most important determinant of ultimate infarct size, knowledge of its size would be helpful in making therapeutic decisions during acute myocardial infarction. We hypothesized that indirect estimations of the risk area by use of clinical, electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, or angiographic variables are inaccurate in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Accordingly, these variables were correlated with an echocardiographically derived risk area in 24 patients experiencing their first acute myocardial infarction. These patients underwent cardiac catheterization and echocardiography within 3 hours of hospital admission. The clinical (Killip class) and electrocardiographic findings (number of leads with ST segment changes) correlated poorly with the size of the risk area (r = 0.28 and r = -0.10, respectively). Hemodynamic data (which included right atrial, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge, aortic, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures) and cardiac output, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and heart rate demonstrated a poor correlation (r less than or equal to 0.47) with the risk area. The left ventricular ejection fraction and the number of diseased vessels determined by angiography also correlated poorly with the risk area (r = -0.47 and r = 0.10, respectively). Patients with multivessel disease were more likely to have abnormal wall motion remote from the infarct zone compared to patients with single-vessel disease (45% versus 8%, p less than 0.05). The left ventricular ejection fractions were lower in the group of patients with multivessel disease (0.43 versus 0.51, p = 0.06) and correlated better with the total extent of abnormal wall motion on echocardiography compared to patients with single-vessel disease (r = -0.67 versus r = -0.007). We conclude that clinical, electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, and angiographic variables do not provide an accurate estimate of the size of the left ventricular risk area during acute myocardial infarction. A direct visualization of left ventricular dynamics may provide a more accurate assessment of the size of the risk area and the total extent of left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

With two-dimensional imaging, the left main coronary artery was visualized in 22 patients (88%), left anterior descending in 13 patients (52%), and circumflex in 22 patients (88%). Stenoses were correctly identified in four of four left main coronary arteries, in five of seven left anterior descending arteries, and in none of four left circumflex arteries. Adding color flow to two-dimensional imaging in 20 patients, we found a disturbed flow signal, as a sign of stenosis, in five of five left anterior descending artery and two of four left circumflex artery stenoses. We concluded that these initial findings with this new 7.5 MHz annular array two-dimensional and color flow Doppler transducer, are promising in imaging and detection of stenoses in the proximal parts of the left coronary artery.\r"

  ".W": "The present study tested the hypothesis that a second-generation endocardial edge detection algorithm that used a priori endocardial and epicardial information would improve accuracy and reduce the variability of border definition. Five nonexpert observers utilized the version 2 algorithm on 20 cycles of two-dimensional short-axis images (five excellent, seven good, and eight poor quality studies stored digitally from a previously reported project). Manually defined areas by five recognized experts on these 20 cardiac cycles were considered to be \"true areas.\" Areas defined by the experts with version 1 of the algorithm were also used for comparison. Regression of the version 2 areas with mean, manually defined excellent quality areas yielded a similar correlation (r = 0.985) to that reported between the manual and the version 1 areas (r = 0.986). For all 20 cycles in the series, however, the correlation between version 2 and the manually defined areas was lower (r = 0.952) than that of the same correlation with version 1 areas (r = 0.980). For all studies the interobserver variability (percent area difference) was +/- 14.4% for manually defined borders, +/- 11.1% for version 1-defined borders, and +/- 7.7% for version 2-defined borders. No difference in variability was observed for excellent quality studies (+/- 5.3% versus 5.2%) between version 1 and version 2 areas. However, the version 2 algorithm significantly reduced interobserver variability for good and poor quality studies (+/- 8.4% to 7.6%, p less than 0.025, and 16.3% to 9.1%, p less than 0.05, respectively). We concluded that: the version 2 algorithm provided accuracy and significantly reduced the variability of area measurement in good and poor quality studies and that epicardial information was important to the improvement by providing wall thickness information to assist in filling areas of dropout and avoidance of intracavitary structures.\r"

  ".W": "Intracoronary and, more recently, intravenous injection of a contrast medium renders it possible to determine myocardial perfusion by use of ultrasound. For the analysis of the data obtained with two-dimensional phased array echocardiographic equipment, two methods can be carried out. First, in the off-line method, the images stored on video tape can be transferred to a computer memory by use of a frame grabber, after which computer analysis of the data can be performed. Second, the phased-array electronics can be directly connected to a computer. In this setup the computer controls the phased array, and the data transported consists of the high-frequency signal. Both methods are described. Some advantages of high-frequency measurements over video-densitometry are the independence of the setup of the two dimensional machine and the higher signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, there is the possibility to use the amplitude, phase, and frequency of the high-frequency signal. In this way a detailed study of the contrast medium is possible and the analysis can also be performed for the purpose of a combination with other methods, such as tissue identification.\r"

Fifteen of the neonates were given Ringer-acetate as the only crystalloid peroperative fluid; to the other 15, 10% glucose i.v. was administered during surgery. In the Ringer-acetate group, mean (SD) blood concentration of glucose increased from 3.1 (2.0) to 4.3 (2.4) mmol litre-1 during surgery. The corresponding increase in the glucose-supplemented group was 3.4 (1.5) to 6.3 (2.2) mmol litre-1. In the Ringer-acetate group, peroperative blood concentrations of glucose were found to be low if a preoperative glucose infusion was interrupted at the start of anaesthesia. Hypoglycaemia occurred in both groups, but more often in the group given Ringer-acetate only (3/15 vs 1/15). Hypoglycaemia was found only in neonates less than 48 h of age and during the first 1 h of anaesthesia only. Monitoring of blood concentrations of glucose and adjustment of the glucose infusion appears to be desirable during and after surgery in neonates.\r"

  ".W": "The anaesthetic records of 61 patients who had experienced adverse reactions thought to be malignant hyperthermia (MH) were reviewed retrospectively to evaluate the diagnostic importance of clinical symptoms. Using the in vitro contracture test, 38 (62%) patients were identified as MH susceptible (MHS), the remainder showing normal test results (MHN). Generalized rigidity, ventricular arrhythmias, cyanosis and postoperative myoglobinuria were observed significantly more often in MHS patients. Median values of body temperature and creatine kinase serum concentrations were significantly greater in the MHS group. Masseter spasm and sinus tachycardia were as common in MHS as in MHN individuals. Statistical models using generalized rigidity, ventricular arrhythmias, cyanosis and fever exceeding 38 degrees C for prediction of MH showed a maximum sensitivity and specificity of 78% and thus are not acceptable for clinical use. For definitive diagnosis of MH, the well established in vitro contracture test remains essential.\r"

This finding may be explained by modelling the thorax and abdomen as a system of coupled masses and compliances which undergo two different modes of forced oscillation in the frequency range studied. Gas exchange was optimal in the frequency range between the minimal and maximal responses. The tidal volumes produced were greater than anatomical deadspace, suggesting that gas transport was mainly convective in this range.\r"

If this conjugate was found it would indicate that a reductive metabolite of halothane binds covalently with the sulphydryl-containing amino acid, cysteine, a reaction which could lead to hepatic injury. The potential halothane-cysteine conjugate, N-acetyl-S-(2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethyl)-L-cysteine (acetyl BCFEC), was prepared and the identity of the compound established using hydrogen-1 and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy and methane chemical ionization mass spectrometry. A measurement technique for acetyl BCFEC was developed using HPLC with u.v. detection at 200 nm. In six children after halothane anaesthesia, one child being studied twice, urine was collected for up to 1 week and analysed for acetyl BCFEC. Little or no acetyl BCFEC was detected in any of the 43 urine samples tested, indicating that in children it is not a significant urinary metabolite of halothane.\r"

Uptake of halothane was measured from the difference in the concentration in inspired and expired gas and varied from 176 to 310 mg kg-1, depending on minute ventilation. After administration of halothane ceased, its elimination in expired gas was measured in four patients until the conclusion of anaesthesia; 32-37% of the absorbed halothane was expired 90 min after halothane administration ceased. Urinary excretion of trifluoroacetic acid, fluoride and bromide was measured for up to 1 week. Of the absorbed halothane, 11.4% (range 6.3-18.2%) was excreted in urine as trifluoroacetic acid and 0.37% (range 0.10-0.64%) as inorganic fluoride. The urinary half-life of trifluoracetic acid was 41.8 h (range 10.4-59.1 h). The quantitative and qualitative metabolism of halothane via the reductive and oxidative pathways in children are comparable to values found in adults. No differences in the metabolism of halothane by children were found which would explain the different incidence of halothane-associated hepatitis compared with adults.\r"

Rats were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane. MCAO was performed during four conditions: normotension (mean arterial pressure (MAP) 107 (SD 15) mm Hg); hypovolaemic hypotension (blood withdrawn to reduce MAP to 43 (2) mm Hg); nitroprusside (SNP) hypotension (MAP reduced to 45 (3) mm Hg); isoflurane hypotension (MAP reduced to 44 (3) mm Hg with 3.5 (0.48)% isoflurane). Hypotension was established before MCAO and was maintained for 10 min, at which time the dimension of the brain areas with zero CBF was determined autoradiographically. All hypotensive regimens were associated with significantly larger areas of extreme CBF reduction. In a coronal section at the centre of the MCA distribution, the area with zero CBF (expressed as a percentage of the area of the entire coronal section) was: normotension 4.7 (4.5)%; hypovolaemic hypotension 10.1 (2.8)%; nitroprusside hypotension 13.5 (2.0)%; and isoflurane hypotension 11.8 (3.9)%. There were no differences between the three hypotensive regimens. The data indicate that, when focal cerebral ischaemia occurs during hypotension (MAP 45 mm Hg) induced by any of the three regimens evaluated, extreme CBF reduction occurs over larger areas than are observed during normotension. These data confirm the importance of arterial pressure as a determinant of collateral flow during focal cerebral ischaemia.\r"

Sixteen women did not become pregnant and in eight of them relaxin (but not beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin, beta-hCG) was measurable for the first time at days 6 to 12. Concentrations of other hormones measured were also different in these eight women compared with the remaining eight non-pregnant women; their serum concentrations of 17 alpha-OH progesterone, progesterone and oestradiol were higher but concentrations of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were lower. Three women became pregnant; relaxin and beta-hCG were first detected on the same day (10 to 12). The remaining woman had increased beta-hCG levels but did not develop a clinical pregnancy. Measurement of serum relaxin during IVF cycles may allow assessment of corpora luteal function before its identification by levels of steroid hormones.\r"

During this period the caesarean section rate increased from 7-10% to 45-50% while concomitantly a sharp decrease in the perinatal mortality rate occurred. A causal relation between the increased rate of abdominal delivery and the improved prognosis for low birthweight twins might be expected. However, analysis of the results failed to show any correlation between these two variables. Factors other than route of delivery seem to have a greater impact on fetal outcome.\r"

  ".W": "All stillbirths and neonatal deaths occurring in the North East Thames region were studied in 1983. This report describes the socio-economic and ethnic differences in that cohort. The stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates of babies born to fathers of social class V (16.8 per 1000 total births) was almost double that of social class I fathers (8.6 per 1000 total births). The most marked social class gradient was seen in the macerated stillbirth groups. Of particular concern was the extremely high stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate for women born in the Indian subcontinent. This was most evident in Pakistani women who had a stillbirth plus neonatal mortality rate of 17.3 per 1000 total births, almost twice that of the women born in the UK (9.0 per 1000 total births). Again, as with social class, macerated stillbirths appeared to contribute disproportionately to the excess mortality. Mortality rates were aggregated into four birthweight specific groups. Asian women had higher mortality rates in the higher birthweight groups, whereas in the lower birthweight group their babies did slightly better. This study indicated that the special needs for working class and ethnic minority mothers within NE Thames were not being met, and the Regional Health Authority was strongly recommended to review services to these groups.\r"

All recurrences were in women with CIN 3. Detailed examination of pretreatment biopsies showed that there were significant differences in both the extent of crypt involvement (P less than 0.01) and maximum depth of CIN (P less than 0.01) between the recurrent groups and the comparison group of women without recurrence. There was also a significant difference in mitotic count between the two groups (P less than 0.01). Immunocytochemical staining for Langerhans' cells or human papilloma virus common antigen showed no significant difference between the two groups. A mitotic count of 35 per ten high-power fields or a depth of crypt involvement greater than 1.7 mm in the pretreatment biopsy was invariably associated with recurrence and identified 13/22 (59%) cases of recurrent disease. The histological reporting of these features may be of value in predicting a group of women at high risk of recurrence of CIN after local treatment.\r"

The aim of this study was to examine the value of UPP in the diagnosis of GSI. Data from 102 urodynamically normal women and 70 women with GSI were compared. Thirty UPP variables from the resting and stress profiles were examined. The urodynamic diagnosis was made on the basis of a pad test, uroflowmetry and videocystourethrography. Each UPP variable was examined singly and thereafter all the measurements were examined by discriminate analysis. The single most discriminatory UPP variable was 'area under the stress profile' but the overlap between normal and GSI patients was too great to allow the test to be used diagnostically. Discriminate analysis resulted in correct classification in 78% of cases. On the basis of these results, UPP is not an accurate test for the diagnosis of GSI.\r"

Clinical presentation was that of subacute small bowel obstruction. Small bowel barium studies showed multiple discrete strictures. Some strictures were indistinguishable from those of regional enteritis. Others however were narrow \"diaphragm-like\" septae encroaching on and markedly narrowing the ileal lumen, and shown histologically to be due to submucosal fibrosis. It is suggested that these strictures are likely to be consequent on NSAIDs administration and that radiologists and surgeons need to be aware of these \"diaphragms\" which can be very difficult to detect on barium examination, either small bowel follow-through or enteroclysis, and at laparotomy.\r"

A normal scintiscan is unlikely to miss significant pathology (as demonstrated by sialography), but sialography must always be performed if there is a suspicion of duct obstruction on scintigraphy. Patients suspected of focal salivary gland pathology such as tumour have not been investigated.

Radiologically, the lesions were lytic in 66.0%, mixed lytic and sclerotic in 12.8% and sclerotic in 21.2%. The time to development of symptomatic skeletal metastases of mixed or sclerotic nature was significantly longer than lytic lesions, and patients with mixed or sclerotic metastases also had better survival.\r"

Histamine and histamine formation capacity (HFC) in the oxyntic region of the stomach were assayed at regular intervals for 7 weeks. After 9 Gy, mean gastric mural histamine fell to 61% of the control value (p less than 0.01) 7 days after irradiation while HFC rose to 172% (p less than 0.05). Both histamine and HFC returned to control values within 2 weeks after irradiation. With 15 Gy, on Day 7, histamine fell to 46% (p less than 0.01) and HFC rose to 260% (p less than 0.05). Histamine concentration remained low (less than half of the control value) while HFC returned to normal. These dose-dependent changes in histamine were observed neither elsewhere in the gut nor in the circulating blood. Further groups of mice were exposed to 3, 6, 9 or 15 Gy to the stomach, with gastric histamine and HFC assayed on Day 7. Histamine concentration was inversely related to dose (r = -0.59, p less than 0.001) and HFC was directly dose dependent (r = 0.52, p less than 0.001). These results suggest that irradiation of the stomach may reduce gastric histamine without inducing a general histamine release. The depletion of the gastric histamine store may explain the inhibitory effect of irradiation of the stomach on gastric acid secretion.\r"

Because of 3 cases of severe papaverine-induced dysrhythmia in our laboratory, QT intervals and hemodynamic and intracoronary velocity data collected during intracoronary papaverine administration were retrospectively reviewed in 34 patients; 20 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and 14 patients (group 2) before and (group 2) after single-vessel left coronary angioplasty. QT intervals increased from 394 +/- 44 to 464 +/- 73 msec, 414 +/- 47 to 504 +/- 95 msec, and 410 +/- 41 to 486 +/- 75 msec for groups 1 and 2 before and after angioplasty, respectively (all P less than 0.01). There was no correlation with hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, or coronary vasodilatory reserve responses and change in QTc interval. In the 3 index patients having significant papaverine-related arrhythmias, a baseline QT interval was prolonged (after prior papaverine exposure) in only 1 in association with torsade de pointes. These data indicate that QT interval prolongation after papaverine is a common occurrence, but that the production of ventricular dysrhythmia is probably idiosynchratic in origin. In view of these findings, we recommend that appropriate antiarrhythmic preparations be in place for patients receiving intracoronary papaverine.\r"

Inflations with the passive perfusion balloon were alternated with a standard balloon with the initial balloon chosen randomly in 24 coronary arteries. End-points for terminating the balloon inflation were the appearance of 2 mm of ST segment deviation from baseline on the electrocardiogram, the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation, or 30 min of balloon inflation. During balloon inflation contrast injections were performed through the guiding catheter and flow distal to the balloon was graded 0-3 using the TIMI scale. The average (+/- SD) inflation time for the standard balloon was 3.1 +/- 2.2 minutes and for the perfusion balloon was 27.2 +/- 4.8 min (P less than 0.001). Electrocardiographic evidence of 2 mm of ST segment deviation from baseline was seen during 11/13 inflations with the standard balloon and in 3/11 balloon inflations with the perfusion balloon. Ventricular fibrillation occurred during 2/13 of the standard balloon inflations and in none during passive balloon inflations. Distal contrast flow during passive balloon inflations averaged 2.7 +/- 0.5 (TIMI scale 0-3) and was absent during inflations with the standard balloon. The perfusion balloon allowed prolonged inflations with excellent distal flow when compared to the standard balloon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Further, the derivative of right ventricular (RV) pressure (P) is broad or double peaked, with one peak occurring coincidentally with peak left ventricular (LV) dP/dt. Both observations suggest a direct LV assistance to RV function. Since the ventricles contract nearly simultaneously, the relative contribution of LV to RV pump function has been difficult to determine. This LV assistance was quantified in six canine experiments using a unique electrically isolated RV preparation. While on total cardiopulmonary bypass, the RV free wall was electrically isolated from the remainder of the heart. This preparation allowed for wide variations in the timing interval between RV and LV contractions. Double-peaked waveforms for RVP and pulmonary flow (RVF) occurred over a wide range (0 to 300 ms) of pacing intervals between the RV and LV. One derivative peak always followed RV contraction for RVP and RVF (r = 0.971 +/- .011, P less than 0.01: r = 0.972 +/- .012, p less than 0.01; respectively). The second derivative peak was unrelated to the RA-RV pacing interval (r = 0.297 +/- .191, P greater than 0.5 RVP; 4 = 0.237 +/- .278, P greater than 0.5 RVF), but corresponded to the maximal LVP rise. Additionally, the magnitude of the two derivative peaks was similar when the ventricles contracted synchronously. When RV contraction preceded or followed LV contraction, the derivative peak associated with LV contraction was significantly greater (P less than 0.05, range 2.1 +/- 0.6 to 6.7 +/- 1.6 for RVP; P less than 0.05 range 1.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.7 +/- 1.5 for RVF) than the derivative associated with RV contraction. These data demonstrate a normally present, large LV assistance to RV contraction and may help to explain the RV response to myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the incidence and extent of distal embolization during percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and rotational thrombectomy (PRT), we collected, filtered, and weighed the distal effluent of acute thrombotically occluded canine arteries following mechanical thrombolysis. PRT (n = 11) and PTA (n = 10) were equally effective in recanalizing occluded vessels (91% vs. 90%) and reduced percent diameter stenosis to a similar degree (97 +/- 6% to 8 +/- 11% and 100 +/- 0% to 17 +/- 23%, respectively). Distal embolization following mechanical intervention was observed in 10 of 10 and 8 of 9 arteries recanalized with PRT and PTA, respectively. The mean weights of collected emboli were similar between the two groups (18 +/- 24 mg vs. 37 +/- 79 mg, PRT vs. PTA, P = NS), although the range of size and weight of thromboemboli was larger in the PTA group (0-206 mg vs. 2-51 mg, PRT). Angiographically defined residual thrombus was significantly less frequent in arteries recanalized with PRT as compared with PTA (10% vs. 55%, P = 0.03). In summary, PRT and PTA are equally effective in recanalizing acutely occluded canine arteries and result in similar reductions in percent diameter stenosis. Each intervention results in distal embolization of thrombi. PRT is associated with a reduced incidence of angiographically evident residual thrombus at the site of arterial injury and may avoid embolization of large fragments occasionally produced by PTA. Thus PRT may serve as a useful alternative to coronary angioplasty during acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Once the guidewire has passed, the PEC is advanced and a non-over-the-wire dilatation catheter can be introduced through the PEC. This paper describes the technique in a representative case. The results of this technique in 19 consecutive patients with class III-IV/IV(NYHA) angina due to an occluded coronary artery are presented.

Sarcolemmal vesicles were incubated in 160 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES at 25 degrees C (pH 7.4) and actively loaded with 45Ca2+ for 2 minutes by Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. After further uptake was inhibited by dilution into 0.15 mM Na(+)-free EGTA, sarcolemmal vesicles were immobilized on a rapid filtration apparatus that allowed millisecond resolution of 45Ca2+ fluxes. In the presence of external NaCl (Na+o) but not other monovalent cations (i.e., K+, Li+), a biphasic pattern of Ca2+ release was observed--an initial brief and rapid rate of Ca2+ release followed by a second slower, prolonged phase of Ca2+ release. Semilogarithmic plots of sarcolemmal Ca2+ content versus time were not linear but were consistent with a biexponential rate of Na+o-induced Ca2+ release during the first several seconds of the exchange reaction. The fast phase of Na+o-stimulated Ca2+ release was several thousand-fold more rapid than that in the absence of Na+o. Both phases of Ca2+ release showed a similar Na+o dependence (Km, approximately 12 mM) with evidence of a positive cooperative effect of Na+. Vmax of the fast and slow phases were approximately 37.0 and approximately 0.76 nmol/mg/sec, respectively. Using rapid-reaction techniques, we demonstrated in the present study that the initial velocity of sarcolemmal Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity is greater than previously reported in sarcolemmal vesicles and that this exchange process exhibits complex rate behavior with a biphasic pre-steady state kinetic pattern.\r"

In the present study, the changes of superficial proximal reabsorption to decreased and increased renal perfusion pressure were determined in rats by an in vivo microperfusion method. In vivo microperfusion was selected as the method to determine the proximal sodium reabsorption because this method made it possible to deliver a constant fluid and electrolyte load to the proximal tubule without the influence of possible changes of glomerular filtration rate. Renal perfusion pressure was decreased from normal pressure by inflating a suprarenal aortic cuff and was increased from the normal level by the occlusion of celiac and mesenteric arteries and the infrarenal aorta. Although fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) in the urine was decreased from 1.24 +/- 0.23% to 0.45 +/- 0.11% (n = 7, p less than 0.01) when renal perfusion pressure was decreased from 125 +/- 6 to 99 +/- 3 mm Hg, absolute tubular reabsorption by the superficial proximal convoluted tubules was not increased (from 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.2 +/- 0.3 nl/min/mm, n = 22).

  ".W": "During internal defibrillation, potential gradients greater than 100 V/cm occur near defibrillation electrodes. Such strong fields may cause deleterious effects, including arrhythmias. This study determined 1) the effects of such strong fields on the propagation of activation and 2) whether these effects were different for monophasic and biphasic shocks. Voltages and potential gradients during the shock, as well as activation sequences before and after the shock, were mapped from 117 epicardial electrodes placed over a 3 x 3-cm area on the right ventricle in six dogs. Pacing at a cycle length of 350 msec was given from a long narrow electrode on the right side of the mapped area to generate parallel activation isochrones. A monophasic shock, 10 msec in duration, or a biphasic shock with both phases 5 msec in duration was delivered 300 msec after the last paced stimulus via a mesh electrode on the left side of the mapped area as the cathode, with the anode on the right atrium. Shocks of 70-850 V were given, and the potential gradient and current density at each recording electrode were calculated from the measured potentials and fiber orientation by using a finite element method. Pacing was resumed 200 msec after the shock, and activation sequences were mapped for up to 5 minutes. Potential gradients ranged from 1 to 189 V/cm with high fields on the left side and low fields on the right side of the mapped area. Where the potential gradient was weak, the first activation sequence after the shock was similar to that before the shock, but activation blocked without conducting into areas where the gradient was greater than 64 +/- 4 (mean +/- SD) V/cm for monophasic and greater than 71 +/- 6 V/cm for biphasic shocks. These values are significantly different (p less than 0.003). The higher the potential gradient, the longer was the duration of block before conduction returned. Block duration, however, was generally shorter for biphasic than for monophasic waveforms of the same field strength. In conclusion, conduction block can follow either waveform, but biphasic waveforms cause less block than monophasic waveforms. This effect may partially explain the increased defibrillation efficacy of biphasic shocks.\r"

  ".W": "Postnatal development of the mammalian heart is associated with changes in the population of isoforms of the thin filament proteins. We correlated the change in thin filament proteins, which occur in rabbit hearts between 5 days and 22 days of age, with changes in Ca2+ dependence of myofibrillar ATPase activity, force generation, and troponin C Ca2+ binding. The preparations derived from the 5-day-old animals exhibited a high molecular weight isoform of troponin T not found in the hearts of the 22-day-old animals. Other troponin T isoforms were also found to be present in different relative amounts. No other major differences in thin filament protein composition could be identified. Compared with the 5-day-old rabbit heart preparations, the ATPase activity of myofibrils from 22-day-old rabbit hearts exhibited a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity. The pCa50 (negative log of the half-maximal-activity free Ca2+) of the MgATPase activity was shifted by 0.15 pCa units with maturation. Maturation of the myofibrils was also associated with an increased effect of Mg2+ on pCa50. On increasing the Mg2+ from 2 to 10 mM at constant MgATP2-, the pCa50 of 5-day myofibrils was increased (shifted to the right) by 0.39 pCa units for 5-day-old rabbit hearts and 0.45 pCa units for 22-day-old rabbit hearts. Although similar changes in pCa50 of force developed by myofibrils were marginally significant, fibers from hearts of 5-day-old rabbits exhibited a greater Hill coefficient than hearts from 22-day-old rabbits (3.0 vs. 2.1). Despite the increased sensitivity of 5-day-old rabbit hearts to Ca2+, these hearts exhibited significantly less Ca2+ bound to myofibrillar troponin C than did the 22-day-old rabbit hearts. Moreover, the models that best described the Ca2+ binding data are different for the two age groups. Our data indicate that the Ca2+ activation and Ca2+ binding properties of myofibrillar troponin C are altered in developing cardiac myofibrils and that the changes in these properties may be influenced by changes in the troponin T isoforms present in the myofibril.\r"

  ".W": "Early transmitral flow (MiF) patterns depend strongly on the rate of fall of measured left ventricular pressure (Pm) determined by both the active decay of pressure (Pa) due to myocardial relaxation and the increase in pressure due to stretch of passive elements during filling (Pp). This study was designed to uncouple passive forces from deactivation in order to reveal the instantaneous rate and duration of myocardial relaxation. We assumed a parallel combination of passive and active elements: Pm(t,V) = Pa(t) + Pp(V), with no constraints on the form of Pa(t), where t is time and V is ventricular volume. Pp(V) was determined by a retrospective analysis of data obtained in 11 anesthetized dogs instrumented for volume clamping with a remote-controlled mitral valve, with left atrial and left ventricular micromanometers, and with an electromagnetic probe to measure MiF. The passive pressure-volume relation (both positive and negative portions) was determined by clamping at end-systolic volume or after various filling volumes, and fit to logarithmic functions. Pp(t) was then calculated from Pp(V) and V(t) (integral of MiF). Time to end relaxation (Ter) was defined as time when Pa = 0. During isovolumic relaxation, when dPp/dt = 0, dPm/dt is equal to the relaxation rate, dPa/dt. In completely isovolumic relaxations, asymptote P infinity = -7 +/- 6 mm Hg (thus, Pa is 7 mm Hg greater than Pm) and Ter = 40 +/- 15 msec, compared with 175 +/- 53 msec during normal filling. In high versus low inotropic state, Pa at the beginning of filling was greater (18.1 +/- 6.1 vs. 12.2 +/- 3.9 mm Hg), and Ter was shorter (170 +/- 42 vs. 228 +/- 43 msec). Active pressure Pa(t) during filling is not an exponential function, and at any time, it was always greater after filling than in nonfilling beats, which indicates an increase in the relaxation duration. We conclude that myocardial relaxation is modulated by filling, which slows its rate and increases its duration, and is therefore a function of both ventricular volume and time. Such a mechanism may have an important role in regulating the diastolic pressure-volume relation.\r"

  ".W": "The goals of this study were to test the following hypotheses: 1) Coronary autoregulatory adjustments to decreases in perfusion pressure occur primarily in coronary arterioles (less than 150 microns in diameter). 2) Small coronary arteries (greater than 150 microns in diameter) can be recruited to participate in the autoregulatory adjustments as perfusion pressure is progressively lowered. 3) Small arterioles are the location of vasodilator reserve in the coronary microcirculation during hypoperfusion. Studies were performed in anesthetized open-chest dogs in which coronary perfusion pressures were reduced to 80, 60, 40, and 30 mm Hg. During reductions in coronary perfusion pressure, measurements were made of systemic hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow (radioactive microspheres), and coronary microvascular diameters. Arterial pressure and heart rate were largely unchanged during the experimental maneuvers. Measurements of microvascular diameters in the beating heart were performed during epi-illumination via a stroboscopic light source synchronized to the cardiac cycle using fluorescence intravital microscopy. Coronary autoregulatory adjustments were evident during reductions in perfusion pressure from control (96 mm Hg) to 80 and 60 mm Hg. Blood flow was unchanged from control, and active vasodilation of coronary arterioles was observed. At 80 mm Hg, only coronary arterioles dilated (4.4 +/- 1.2%), whereas at 60 mm Hg both small arteries (4.9 +/- 2.2%) and arterioles (6.9 +/- 1.2%) demonstrated significant vasodilation (p less than 0.05). The magnitude of dilation (i.e., percent increase in diameter) was inversely related to the initial diameter; that is, the arterioles dilated to a greater extent, percentage wise, than the small arteries. At 40 mm Hg, myocardial blood flow decreased slightly from that under control conditions, but coronary arterioles dilated to a greater extent than at 60 mm Hg (8.1 +/- 1.6%); yet, microvessels were incompletely vasodilated, because adenosine produced a further increase in microvessel diameter (12.5 +/- 2.1%) (p less than 0.05). At a perfusion pressure of 30 mm Hg, arterioles demonstrated a decrease in vascular diameter (-0.2 +/- 2.1%), which was reversed by adenosine (11.1 +/- 3.1%). From these results we concluded the following: 1) Coronary autoregulatory adjustments involve primarily coronary arteriolar vessels, but small coronary arteries can be recruited to participate in the autoregulatory response. 2) The magnitude of vessel dilation appears to be inversely related to vascular diameter. 3) Coronary arterioles are not maximally vasodilated during coronary hypoperfusion, and these vessels may be the source of persistent vasomotor tone during coronary insufficiency.\r"

Sarcomere length and Vo were measured by laser diffraction techniques. Sarcomere length and sarcomere velocity, determined from each of the first-order diffraction lines, differed by less than 4%. Slack sarcomere length in the trabeculae appeared to be 1.9 microns. Isovelocity release techniques were used to obtain sarcomere velocity and Vo directly. Sarcomere velocity was measured at SL = 1.9-2.0 microns for elimination of contributions of parallel elastic force and restoring force to the external load of the sarcomeres. Peak twitch force development (Fo) was maximal (Fo-max) at 25 degrees C at [Ca2+]o = 1.5 mM. Lowering of the temperature below 25 degrees C led to development of spontaneous sarcomere activity and depression of Fo; both responses could be prevented by the addition of 0.5 mM procaine. Increase of temperature above 25 degrees C reduced twitch duration and Fo. Hill's rectangular hyperbola fitted the force-velocity data if the load during shortening was less than 70% of Fo. Vo appeared to be independent of the level of activation at all temperatures when Fo was maintained above 90% of Fo-max, either by an increase of [Ca2+]o (to 3.0 mM) or by paired pulse stimulation. Vo increased with increasing temperature; the parameter a, calculated from force-velocity relations measured at 20 degrees, 25 degrees, and 30 degrees C, decreased with increasing temperature. The Arrhenius plot of Vo was studied in detail over a wider temperature range (15 degrees-35 degrees C) and in smaller temperature increments. The relation was linear between 18 degrees and 33 degrees C; the observed Q10, defined as the ratio of Vo measured at temperature (T) over Vo at T-10 degrees C, was 4.6 A Q10 of 4.6 for Vo is consistent with the reported temperature dependence of rat cardiac actin-activated myosin ATPase, which suggests that the same reaction step may limit the activity of the enzyme in vitro and during shortening of the cardiac sarcomeres at zero external load.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the mechanism of contractile dysfunction in postischemic (\"stunned\") myocardium, time-resolved measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were made using gated 19F nuclear magnetic resonance in seven perfused ferret hearts loaded with the fluorinated Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA. Left ventricular developed pressure decreased to 65 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) of control after 15 minutes of global ischemia at 37 degrees C. In stunned myocardium, diastolic [Ca2+]i (0.24 +/- 0.03 microM) was not changed from control (0.18 +/- 0.03 microM, p greater than 0.10), but peak [Ca2+]i (1.03 +/- 0.13 microM) was paradoxically higher than that in control (0.61 +/- 0.06 microM, p less than 0.02). The slope of the relation between developed pressure and Ca2+ transient amplitude in stunned myocardium was significantly lower than that in control (p less than 0.05), even after normalization by maximal Ca2(+)-activated pressure. These results indicate that contractile failure in stunned myocardium is due to a decrease in the myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ as well as to the previously identified decrease in maximal Ca2(+)-activated force; failure of activator Ca2+ delivery cannot be implicated. The increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ transients would require that more ATP be spent in Ca2+ sequestration; thus, decreased efficiency of energy utilization in stunned myocardium would result.\r"

  ".W": "We applied the cell-attached and inside-out patch-clamp technique under symmetrical isotonic potassium conditions on single human (and guinea pig) atrial cells. The human cells were isolated by a modified method to that described earlier. Our aim was twofold: 1) to study the single-channel characteristics of potassium channels in human atrial single cells, present under basal conditions (iK1 and iK(ATP] or when stimulated with 10(-5) M acetylcholine; and 2) to calculate the contribution of these three channel types to the total basal potassium conductance in human atrial cells, and to compare the results with data on guinea pig atrial cells under the same conditions. We found that in human cells 58% of the patches (n = 42/74) contained acetylcholine-sensitive potassium channels: their conductance was 42 +/- 1.2 pS and mean open time (tau o) was 1.7 +/- 0.5 msec. They showed sporadic openings in the absence of agonist, and activation by acetylcholine was G-protein dependent. In 16% of the patches (n = 7/44), adenosine (10(-4) M) activated the same channels, but the activity was lower than when stimulated by acetylcholine. In 18% of the patches (n = 9/51), an iK1 channel was present (conductance, 27 pS; tau o, 8.7 msec), whereas in the cell-attached mode, ATP-dependent channels were never seen. However, they were present in half of the inside-out patches on washout of ATPi (conductance, 73 pS; tau o, 1.4 msec). The basal potassium conductance (i.e., in the absence of any exogenous hormone or neurotransmitter) was mainly due to iK1 channels in both human and guinea pig cells, a finding that is in contrast with previous reports. However, the potassium current that is induced by acetylcholine is much higher in guinea pig than in human isolated cells; a fraction of it would suffice to fully determine the resting potassium conductance in guinea pig atrial cells, whereas it can play only a modulatory role in human cells. This difference could be important in species-specific autonomic modulation and antiarrhythmic drug action.\r"

Therefore, we investigated the effect of LDL and its oxidative derivatives (ox-LDL) on vascular tone in isolated perfused rabbit femoral arteries. Perfusion of endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded segments with ox-LDL (80 micrograms protein/ml) caused no or only weak vasoconstrictions in the absence of contractile agonists. However, in the presence of ox-LDL, vasoconstrictions to threshold concentrations of norepinephrine, serotonin, phenylephrine, or potassium were significantly enhanced. This enhancement correlated with the degree of oxidation. When ox-LDL was administered at higher concentrations (greater than 200 micrograms protein/ml), it evoked moderate vasoconstrictions even in the absence of contractile agonists. Native LDL had no effect on vascular tone. Preincubation with verapamil, diltiazem, and nitrendipine inhibited vasoconstrictions evoked by ox-LDL, both in the presence and in the absence of a contractile agonist. The contractile responses to ox-LDL were significantly greater in endothelium-denuded segments than in endothelium-intact segments. At the above concentrations, ox-LDL had no influence on endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated vasodilations. These data indicate that ox-LDL enhances agonist-induced vasoconstrictions by a direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle. We therefore suggest that ox-LDL is an important factor that may increase the risk of inappropriate vasoconstriction in hypercholesterolemia, independent of its putative cytotoxic effect on the endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Superoxide dismutase (SOD) has been documented to limit myocardial infarct size in the richly collateralized dog heart. This study was designed to explore this concept in a low-collateralized animal model. A blind, randomized, placebo-controlled protocol was used in 65 pentobarbital-anesthetized pigs subjected to closed-chest left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 30 (n = 22), 60 (n = 22), and 90 (n = 14) minutes followed by reperfusion up to 24 hours from the start of occlusion. Another seven control pigs were subjected to 24 hours of permanent occlusion. A total dose of 9 mg/kg bovine CuZn SOD was administered as a bolus injection immediately before reperfusion followed by a 1-hour infusion. Infarct size was assessed by tetrazolium staining. Myocardium at risk and collateral flow were determined by using cerium-141-labeled microspheres (15 microns) during the occlusion. After 30 minutes of occlusion, infarct sizes in placebo versus SOD-treated animals were 45.5 +/- 15.7% vs. 23.8 +/- 15.6% of myocardium at risk (p = 0.007). The corresponding values after 60 minutes of occlusion were 78.6 +/- 9.3% vs. 66.9 +/- 14.6% (p = 0.035). SOD administered after 90 minutes of occlusion did not limit infarct size (88.5 +/- 4.8% vs. 92.3 +/- 5.2%). Twenty-four hours of coronary occlusion resulted in infarction of 92.4 +/- 4.2% of myocardium at risk. (All values are mean +/- SD.) Ventricular fibrillation occurred in only nine pigs distributed equally between SOD and placebo. The results indicate that CuZn SOD has the potential to further improve the myocardial salvage established by reperfusion of an ischemic pig heart territory. However, the narrow time window for limiting infarct size in the pig by reperfusion is not much extended by SOD.\r"

Lower resolution (3-10 mm) isochronal activation maps of the entire epicardial surface were constructed from 126 sites during the initiation and sustenance of reentry and showed reentrant wave fronts that circulated around arcs of functional conduction block. During initiation of reentry by premature stimulation, high-density recordings from these same regions showed that conduction block occurred abruptly, within 1 mm, and without prior decrement of the impulse. Electrograms recorded in proximity to the arc of block were comprised of two deflections: a local activation potential and an electrotonic potential reflecting activation 1 mm away; the reverse order of activation and electrotonus was observed on the opposite side of the arc of block. The occurrence of functional conduction block during premature stimulation in this model was correlated with abrupt increases in effective refractory periods of 10-120 msec (27 +/- 24 msec; mean +/- SD) within 1 mm or less. Neither the abrupt change of refractoriness nor functional conduction block appeared to depend on differences in excitability, the geometrical characteristics of the surviving epicardial layer, or the orientation of the myocardial fibers. During sustained reentrant activation, high-density recordings along the arcs of block showed split electrograms comprised of local activation and electrotonus, which were identical in morphology to those recorded during the initiation of reentry. The interval between the deflections was shorter at the ends of the arc and increased to a maximum value at the center of the arc. The activation potentials corresponded in time with activation of large isochronal regions on either side of the arc of block. There was evidence that at least part of the arc of block during sustained reentry represented thin discrete zones of constant block due to electrotonic influences of impulse penetration from both sides of the arc. Our results strongly suggest that continuous arcs of functional conduction block are a necessary prerequisite for both the initiation and the sustenance of reentrant activation in subacute canine myocardial infarction. Functional conduction block during the initiation of reentry was due to abrupt changes in refractoriness, within a distance of 1 mm or less.\r"

In comparison with the soluble flow marker 2-iododesmethylimipramine (IDMI), deposition of 16.5-microns microspheres was mildly but systematically biased into high flow regions of rabbit hearts (Bassingthwaighte JB, Malone MA, Moffett T-C, King RB, Little SE, Link JM, Krohn KA. Am J Physiol 1987;253 (Heart Circ Physiol 22):H184-H193). To examine the possibility of bias in larger hearts, a similar study was undertaken in sheep. 141Ce- and 103Ru-labeled 16.5-microns microspheres in one syringe and 125I- and 131I-DMI in another syringe were injected simultaneously into the left atrium of five open-chest sheep while obtaining reference blood samples from the femoral artery. In six other sheep, one microsphere type and one IDMI were used. Hearts were removed 1 minute after injection, cut into approximately 254 pieces averaging 217 mg, and regional deposition densities calculated for each tracer from the isotopic counts. Correlations in the five animals between the two differently labeled IDMIs and between the two microspheres were both greater than or equal to 0.98. In all 11 sheep, scatter plots of microsphere deposition densities versus IDMI densities showed that differences between microspheres and IDMI had substantially more scatter (0.84 less than r less than 0.98) but were not random. Microsphere depositions tended to be lower than IDMI depositions in low flow regions and higher in high flow regions, in accord with the expected bias that at a bifurcation a microsphere is most likely to enter the branch with higher flow. There was less bias ascribable to endomyocardial/epicardial maldistribution. Thus, while microsphere depositions appear to err systematically with respect to flow when the regions of interest are small enough that the diameters of their arterioles are only a few times those of the microspheres, microspheres are, in sheep as in rabbits, adequate for estimating regional flows.\r"

Furthermore, receptors for the gonadal steroid hormones are located in centers in the brain involved in the control of vasopressin release and in cardiovascular regulation. We have, therefore, examined the effects of hemorrhage on mean arterial blood pressure, the plasma vasopressin concentration, and plasma renin concentration in conscious male and female rats. In preliminary experiments, no differences were found in blood and plasma volumes with respect to either sex or phase of the estrous cycle. In separate experiments, rats were subjected to two hemorrhages of 10% of blood volume, separated by an interval of 15 minutes. There were no substantial gender- or cycle-related differences in the ability of hemorrhaged rats to maintain mean arterial blood pressure or increase plasma renin concentration. The increase in plasma vasopressin concentration was greater in proestrous females than in males after the first hemorrhage and in diestrous, proestrous, and metestrous females than in males after the second hemorrhage. Pretreatment with a V1-receptor antagonist was without statistically significant effect on the mean arterial blood pressure responses in males, but it impaired blood pressure compensation in females. There are, then, gender- and cycle-related differences in vasopressin responses to hemorrhage, and vasopressin appears particularly important for blood pressure compensation to hemorrhage in female rats.\r"

Tissues were equilibrated at the optimal length for stress development (Lo). Isometric contractions at short tissue lengths (0.7 Lo) were associated with a decrease in maximal stress development. Isometric contraction at 0.7 Lo also reduced the sensitivity to histamine as measured by steady-state increases in [Ca2+], phosphorylation, or stress. This suggests that decreased agonist sensitivity at shorter lengths is caused by reduced Ca2+ mobilization. Isotonic shortening also led to decreases in histamine sensitivity. Isometric contractions at 1.2 Lo were not associated with significant changes in histamine-induced increases in [Ca2+]. The [Ca2+] dependence of phosphorylation was not altered at 0.7 or 1.2 Lo. Sinusoidal length changes from 0.95 to 1.05 Lo at 1 Hz were not associated with significant changes in the resting or histamine-stimulated [Ca2+]. These results suggest that Ca2+ mobilization and the resulting contraction is relatively independent of length changes near Lo. Inactivation occurs at lengths substantially below Lo where Ca2+ mobilization by agonists is impaired.\r"

  ".W": "The contractile response of the aged adult heart to beta-adrenergic stimulation is known to be reduced compared with the young adult heart. Since endogenous adenosine exerts an antiadrenergic action in the heart, this study was undertaken to determine if the basal endogenous level of myocardial adenosine increases with age and whether this increase mediates the reduced responsiveness of aged heart to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Young (3-5 months) and aged (12-22 months) Sprague-Dawley adult rat hearts of CD and SD stock were perfused at constant pressure and paced at 270 contractions/min. The two age groups had a similar level of +dP/dtmax (index of contractility) under control conditions. Adenosine release into the coronary effluent was 30 +/- 3 nmol/min/g dry wt from young and 54 +/- 9 nmol/min/g dry wt from aged hearts. Inosine release was also greater from the aged hearts. Isoproterenol (10(-8) M) stimulation increased contractile state by 113% in young hearts and only 69% in aged hearts. Isoproterenol further increased the adenosine and inosine release from both age groups. Theophylline (5 x 10(-5) M), an adenosine antagonist, prevented the difference in the contractile response to isoproterenol stimulation between the young and aged hearts. Elevation of external calcium from 2 to 4 mM increased contractility equally in both age groups without influencing adenosine release. Myocardial oxygen consumption, coronary effluent PO2, oxygen supply-demand ratio, and lactate release were similar for both age groups, indicating that under the conditions studied the elevated release of adenosine by the aged hearts was not due to hypoxia. Aged (10-14 months) adult guinea pig hearts also displayed a reduced responsiveness to the isoproterenol stimulation and released more adenosine compared with young (3-4 months) adult guinea pig hearts. These findings suggest that enhanced adenosine levels that are present in the aged myocardium are responsible, in part, for the reduced contractile responsiveness of the older adult heart to beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

A brief burst of neural stimuli was delivered during each cardiac cycle. SAS stimulation consistently decreased the atrial cycle length but had variable effects on the AV interval. The positive chronotropic response to SAS stimulation increased when the level of stimulation (i.e., stimulus pulse duration, pulse amplitude, and number of pulses per burst) was increased. When the heart rate was held constant by atrial pacing, SAS stimulation did not change the AV interval. AVS stimulation decreased the AV conduction time but did not change the atrial cycle length. The AV conduction response increased when the level of AVS stimulation was increased. A high level of AVS stimulation induced an AV junctional rhythm in seven of eight experiments. When the atrial pacing interval was decreased, the basal AV interval increased, and the decrease in AV interval induced by AVS stimulation was exaggerated. The chronotropic response to SAS stimulation and the dromotropic response to AVS stimulation were abolished by propranolol given systemically and by lidocaine given topically. From these results, we conclude that in anesthetized dogs treated with atropine, activation of the discrete intracardiac sympathetic nerves to the SA and AV nodal regions controls the sinus rate and AV conduction time independently and activation of the discrete sympathetic nerves may shift the dominant pacemaker site to a subsidiary site.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the duration of hypertension is an essential component in the evolution of myocardial dysfunction, renal artery constriction was performed in male Fischer 344 rats at 4 months of age, and in vivo global cardiac performance of sham-operated and experimental animals was evaluated 8 months later. Systemic arterial blood pressure increased to 173 +/- 5 mm Hg 2 weeks after the arteries were clipped and remained elevated for the following 5 months. Blood pressure decreased over the remaining 3 months to a value not significantly different from control rats that were killed, 132 +/- 4 mm Hg. After 8 months of renovascular hypertension, we observed that the elevated level of systolic arterial pressure was accompanied by a distinct absence of left ventricular hypertrophy when measured at the ventricular weight level. Moreover, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased in hypertensive animals from 6.0 to 24.0 mm Hg while peak left ventricular pressure was identical to controls. In addition, peak +dP/dt and -dP/dt were depressed in hypertensive animals. Although stroke volume was unaltered, cardiac output in renal artery clipped animals was depressed by 34% while total peripheral resistance was elevated by 50%. Ventricular chamber remodeling in the hearts of hypertensive animals was evidenced as a 19% increase in the transverse and a 16% increase in the longitudinal axes of the left ventricle with a 27% diminution of wall thickness. Myocardial damage, in the form of myocyte loss and replacement fibrosis, increased in the hearts of hypertensive animals resulting in a ninefold augmentation in the volume fraction of collagen within the ventricular wall. These alterations in the architectural properties of chamber geometry coupled with the abnormalities in contractile performance resulted in a severe reduction in ejection fraction from 82% to 47% and a marked elevation in transmural diastolic and systolic stress in hypertensive animals. The gradient in stress across the ventricular wall, from epicardium to endocardium, revealed a direct correlation with the regional distribution of myocardial damage. In conclusion, the loading state of the myocardium, tissue injury, and myocardial fibrosis all appear to be critical determinants in the genesis of left ventricular failure in long-term pressure overload.\r"

  ".W": "Cutaneous arterioles are controlled by vasoconstrictor and active vasodilator sympathetic nerves. To find out whether the active vasodilator system is under baroreceptor control, laser-Doppler velocimetry and the local iontophoresis of bretylium were combined to allow selective study of the active vasodilator system. Each of six subjects had two forearm sites (0.64 cm2) treated with bretylium to abolish adrenergic vasoconstrictor control. Laser-Doppler velocimetry was monitored at those sites and at two adjacent untreated sites. Subjects underwent 3 minutes of lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) and 3 minutes of cold stress to verify blockade of vasoconstrictor nerves. They were then subjected to whole-body heat stress (water-perfused suits), and the 3 minutes of LBNP was repeated. Finally, subjects were returned to normothermia, and LBNP and cold stress were repeated to verify the persistence of blockade. During the application of LBNP in normothermia, cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) fell at untreated sites by 22.7 +/- 4.7% (p less than 0.01) but was unaffected at bretylium-treated sites (p greater than 0.20). During cold stress, CVC at untreated sites fell by 30.2 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.01) and at treated sites rose by 0.7 +/- 4.6% (p greater than 0.10). Both control and bretylium-treated sites reflexly vasodilated in response to hyperthermia. With LBNP during hyperthermia, CVC at untreated sites fell by 23.3 +/- 7.1% (p less than 0.05) and at treated sites 17.9 +/- 9.2% (p less than 0.05) with no significant difference between sites (p greater than 0.10). After return to normothermia, neither LBNP application nor cold stress caused CVC to fall at treated sites (p greater than 0.10). Thus, the vasoconstrictor system was blocked by bretylium treatment throughtout the study, whereas the active vasodilator response to heat stress was intact. Because LBNP in hyperthermia induced similar falls in CVC at both sites, we conclude that baroreceptor unloading elicits a withdrawal of active vasodilator tone and that the baroreflex has control of the active vasodilator system.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine the role of the vascular endothelium in regulating the response of small renal arteries to increased transmural pressure and reduced PO2. Canine small renal arteries (496 +/- 32 microns) were isolated, cannulated with micropipettes, and mounted in an in vitro chamber that allowed transmural pressure, tissue bath PO2, and vessel lumen PO2 to be controlled. In intact arteries, elevation of transmural pressure caused contractile activation and a progressive depolarization (0.17 +/- 0.09 mV/mm Hg pressure increase) of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelial damage by air perfusion caused a 13-14% reduction in resting diameter and an 18 +/- 3 mV depolarization of the vascular smooth muscle, but eliminated the progressive contraction and depolarization that occurred in intact vessels in response to transmural pressure elevation. Reduction of either tissue bath O2 concentration or vessel lumen PO2 significantly enhanced norepinephrine-induced contractions of the arteries. Endothelial damage prevented the enhancement of norepinephrine-induced contractions by reduced PO2 in the vessels. The results of this study suggest that the vascular endothelium regulates both myogenic contraction and the enhancement of norepinephrine-induced contractions by reduced PO2 in small arteries of the dog kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies implicate a role for granulocytes in the genesis of the microvascular and parenchymal cell dysfunction, which occurs upon reperfusion of ischemic tissues. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this neutrophil-mediated injury are not completely understood, it is clear that an essential first step in granulocyte migration from the vascular lumen to the interstitial space is adherence to vascular endothelium. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prevention of neutrophil adherence with monoclonal antibody IB4 directed against the neutrophil CD11/CD18 glycoprotein adherence complex or neutrophil depletion with a specific polyclonal antineutrophil serum would attenuate the microvascular dysfunction seen in postischemic skeletal muscle. Changes in vascular permeability were assessed by measurement of the solvent drag reflection coefficient for total plasma proteins (sigma) in isolated canine gracilis muscle subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, ischemia/reperfusion plus antineutrophil serum, or ischemia/reperfusion plus IB4. Estimates of sigma averaged 0.83 +/- 0.04 in nonischemic, control gracilis muscles, while ischemia/reperfusion was associated with a marked increase in vascular permeability (decrease in sigma to 0.54 +/- 0.04) and vascular resistance (increased by 135 +/- 41% over the control value). Prevention of neutrophil adherence or neutrophil depletion prevented this increase in vascular permeability (sigma = 0.80 +/- 0.03 and 1.01 +/- 0.06, respectively) and resistance (decrease of 16.51 +/- 8.0% and increase of 2.4 +/- 4.6% over control values, respectively). The results of this study suggest that neutrophils play a critical role in the genesis of microvascular dysfunction in postischemic skeletal muscle. Furthermore, neutrophil adherence to vascular endothelium appears to be a prerequisite for the production of this injury.\r"

Both were kept at 37 degrees C and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Perfusion pressure and flow were independently controlled by two servo-controlled pumps, and changes in the diameter of the segment were registered by an automated video technique. In the absence of flow, these segments maintained their diameter when intraluminal pressure was changed over the range 30-90 mm Hg. When intraluminal pressure was low (30 mm Hg), flow at 20 microliters/min caused dilation. This is half the rate of flow that causes a maximum flow-induced change under the conditions of these experiments. When pressure was high (90 mm Hg), the same flow rate caused constriction. Both responses usually continued as long as flow was maintained. Thus, flow-induced changes in the diameter of this artery can be initiated and are usually maintained despite the demonstrated capacity of the blood vessel wall to hold its diameter constant when pressure is changed in the absence of flow. The results suggest that these small arteries can independently respond to changes in pressure and flow and that the changes that occur in response to flow are not compensated for by changes in the myogenic response.\r"

Lipid peroxidation after 20 minutes of incubation was monitored by malondialdehyde formation. Similar to propranolol, all three calcium blockers exhibited concentration-dependent (10-400 microM) inhibitory effects against sarcolemmal lipid peroxidation. The order of potency of these agents was nifedipine greater than propranolol greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem. Nifedipine, the most effective calcium blocker, was greater than twofold more potent than propranolol and achieved a significant effect at 10 microM. This study suggests that calcium blockers may provide antiperoxidative protection to cardiac membranes.\r"

The 3:1 ratio of chloromethyl isothiazolinone (CMI): methyl isothiazolinone (MI) in Kathon CG was found to be disturbed in 41% of Kathon CG preserved cosmetic products. The disturbed CMI/MI ratio was shown in 29% \"rinse off\" and 73% \"leave on\" cosmetic products. It is suggested that the chemical reaction of the ketone group of the isothizaolinones with other ingredients in cosmetic products may disturb the CMI/MI ratio of Kathon CG. The results of the study have been discussed in relation to the use of Kathon CG in cosmetic products as well as test material for allergic reaction.\r"

Our objectives were to test whether pretreating the human rectum with an enema of 400 micrograms of a prostaglandin E1 analog (misoprostol) would ameliorate the mucosal injury provoked by an enema of 10 mg of bisacodyl, and to follow the evolution of the bisacodyl-induced injury in normal volunteers. Mucosal biopsies were taken 10 cm from the anus with an endoscopic forceps through a straight sigmoidoscope. Histological sections were interpreted blindly. In a preliminary experiment without bisacodyl, biopsies obtained from six subjects after misoprostol administration were indistinguishable from those taken from another six subjects after enemas of saline. In a parallel treatment experiment involving 30 subjects, all subjects sustained injury to the superficial epithelium and upper third of the crypt within 30 min after bisacodyl. Pretreatment with misoprostol also failed to prevent deeper injury to the lower third of colonic crypts. In a cross-over trial, a subset of four volunteers had biopsies at five different intervals after an enema of bisacodyl or saline. For up to 30 hours after bisacodyl, there was histological evidence of mild inflammation. Bisacodyl-induced colitis might confound the assessment of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

The results of our previous in vitro studies have suggested that laser-induced fluorescence tissue spectra are sufficiently unique that they can be used to accurately diagnose mucosal abnormalities in some systems. To test this hypothesis in vivo, laser-induced fluorescence spectra were obtained during colonoscopy from 31 colonic adenomas, 4 hyperplastic polyps, and 32 examples of normal mucosa in 20 patients. The resulting spectra could be used to correctly differentiate adenomas from normal colonic mucosa and hyperplastic polyps in 97% of the specimens studied with the resulting sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 100%, 97%, and 94%, respectively. These results, although preliminary in nature, suggest that laser-induced fluorescence spectra can be used in the recognition and differential diagnosis of mucosal abnormalities at endoscopy.\r"

The most common indication for droperidol usage was active alcohol abuse or withdrawal (45%). The most frequent dose administered was 2.5 mg (41.1%) followed by 3.75 mg (25.8%). The level of sedation and cooperation was adequate in all but 22 procedures (2.0%). Complications related to droperidol use were infrequent, occurring in 17 procedures (1.5%). There was no mortality or major morbidity resulting from droperidol usage. In our endoscopic population, we find droperidol to be a safe and efficacious adjunctive agent for conscious sedation.\r"

Although complications have occurred, there are no data to suggest that the stents themselves induce ductal changes. In a retrospective review of 34 patients having 38 pancreatic duct stents placed for disrupted ducts, isolated strictures, pancrease divisum, and hypertensive pancreatic sphincters, 36% of all patients (72% of patients who had normal initial pancreatograms) were found to have subsequent ductal changes. Such changes were related either to stent occlusion (pseudocyst, diffuse duct enlargement) and direct stent trauma or side branch occlusion (irregular stenoses, side branch ectasia). Whereas the former resolved with stent retrieval or exchange, it remains uncertain what the long-term consequences of the latter changes will be, despite a tendency for the abnormal pancreatograms to improve with time. Further experience is needed with pancreatic stenting before widespread application of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Between April 1982 and March 1988, 25 patients with chronic pancreatitis presented with biliary stenosis and significant cholestasis. They were treated by endoprosthesis placement. Nineteen patients had jaundice, and, initially, seven had cholangitis (including three with hepatic abscesses). ERCP was successful in all 25 patients. Cholangitis, cholestasis, and jaundice resolved in all cases after stent placement. Two patients died in the 2 months after treatment. Complete follow-up (mean duration, 14 months, range 7 to 42 months) was available for 19 of the 23 remaining patients. Migration of the stent occurred in 10 patients and stent blockage in 8 patients, with relapsing cholestasis (N = 12), cholangitis (N = 4), or without symptoms (N = 2). Only three of these patients are now asymptomatic without a stent in place after 12 to 72 months. In all of the other cases, stents have been replaced or patients have been treated by surgery. We conclude that endoscopic biliary drainage is an effective treatment for resolving cholangitis or jaundice in patients with chronic pancreatitis and biliary stenosis, but that the results of definitive endoscopic drainage for these patients are less satisfactory because resolution of the stricture after removal of the stent is rarely obtained.\r"

Although malpractice insurance premiums have moderated, access to care is being restricted in communities where obstetricians and family practitioners have decided to give up delivering babies. Nor does the future look any brighter. Experts predict that medical students will shun obstetrical and other high-risk specialties to avoid the high cost of malpractice insurance. On the national level, President Bush has expressed concern that the liability situation is adding to the high cost of health care. And a number of congressmen have responded with legislation.\r"

The remaining three days were designated as low stress days by virtue of the fact that no unusual demands were made on the students, and they simply attended lectures as usual. All students showed significantly greater levels of electromyographic activity on the high stress days compared to the low stress days, but there was not a statistically significant difference between the headache and control groups. Headache group subjects reported significantly higher levels of pain compared to the control group, but their pain ratings did not differ between high and low stress days. Subjective ratings of negative affective states (anxiety, anger, sadness, and frustration) were significantly greater on high stress days compared to low stress days. Headache group subjects also exhibited a tendency to report higher levels of negative affective states than did control group subjects, but only in the case of frustration was the .05 level of statistical significance achieved.\r"

We reported that migraine patients have an increase in 5HT binding parallel to the progression of the attack, with the appearance of a subsequent phenomenon of cellular deactivation. The same experiment previously carried out in cluster headache patients revealed a lack of high affinity binding sites, independently of the pain period. Low levels of plasma 5HT were recently described by Anthony in chronic tension-type headache. The implication of 5HT in tension headache was also hypothesized by Shukla with the demonstration of an increased 5HT uptake by platelets. We studied the 5HT binding on surfaces of lymphocytes and monocytes in 26 tension-type headache patients (16 affected by chronic form (CTH) of the disease and 10 by episodic form (ETH]. Fourteen clinically healthy subjects were used as controls. Circulating lymphocytes and monocytes were tested for their ability to specifically bind 5HT, using (3H) labeled 5HT. The \"in vitro\" 5HT binding curves to lymphocytes and monocytes of tension-type headache patients show a constant trend; during headaches, both CTH and ETH patients present a desensitization phenomenon with a complete loss of high affinity binding sites for 5HT. The 5HT binding curve observed in controls is indistinguishable from that of ETH patients studied outside the attack period. The total amount of 5HT bound appeared to be more markedly raised in CTH patients than in ETH patients when compared to control values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This phenomenon led to an investigation of the phenotypic expression of PBL before and after IL-2 incubation, and of the IL-2 lymphocyte receptor. IL-2 receptor is expressed on T-lymphocytes activated with an high-affinity binding site. The analysis of the function of human IL-2 receptor was facilitated by the production of a specific monoclonal antibody (MAb). This MAb identifies the IL-2 receptors by blocking the binding of radiolabelled IL-2 to T-cells. In addition, we studied the expression of Leu-4, specific for T-cells; of Leu-11b, specific for FC receptor on NK cells; and the Transferrin Receptor, specific for lymphoblasts and monocytes. Twenty-three episodic CH patients were selected for this study. Ten sex and age-matched healthy volunteers were used as the control group. We evaluated the PBL phenotypic expression of cells subsets before incubation with IL-2 (1,000 I.U./ml) and after 72 hours. The following Becton Dickinson MAbs have been used: anti-Leu-4 (CD3), anti-IL-2 receptors (CD25), anti-Transferrin receptor (TFR) and anti-Leu-11b (CD16). Indirect fluorescence with a Becton Dickinson FACS-420 flow cytometer was used to analyze the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A total of 76 patients (69 women and 7 men) with a mean age of 40 years (r: 24-74 years) were included. An overall severity index for SLE was applied. Fifty-two patients (68%) presented headache, 27 (52%) being vascular and 25 (48%) muscle contraction type. Headache in general was more frequent after the onset of SLE (p less than .001). Prevalence of muscle contraction headache in particular was greater following manifestations of SLE. Family history of migraine was recorded in 54% of the patients with vascular headache. This antecedent was more common in patients in whom migraine started before the onset of SLE (p = .05). A greater number of neuropsychiatric symptoms was observed in the patients with vascular headache and family history (p less than .02). Patients with thrombocytopenia presented headache less frequently (p less than .05). Our results showed headache, of both vascular and muscle contraction types, to be frequent in SLE. We note that there is an increased frequency of muscle contraction headache after the onset of SLE, and that there is a migraine-like headache directly related to SLE. Migrainous patients with familial history have a greater probability to suffer neuropsychiatric manifestations. Finally, it is suggested that severity of SLE is not related to presence of headache.\r"

Incidence of burn wound colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in patients treated with silver sulfadiazine has spurred research for other agents. A topical preparation that contains zinc and sulfadiazine (Zad-G) was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial spectrum and in vivo efficacy. Muscle biopsy specimens of rats treated with Zad-G appear to have fewer colonies of S. aureus than groups treated with silver sulfadiazine. Topical therapy with Zad-G for patients with burns was comfortable, reduced wound infection, and was comparable to therapy with silver sulfadiazine. A topical Zad-G preparation that contains zinc sulfadiazine appears to be an effective alternative to silver sulfadiazine in the treatment of burn wounds.\r"

Fourteen percent of all patients were intubated (n = 117); patients intubated on the day of injury (n = 41) were more likely to extubate themselves or have technical problems with the endotracheal tube. Twelve percent of patients with smoke inhalation without burns required endotracheal intubation versus 62% of those with burns. An endotracheal tube was required for a median of 5 days. Tracheotomies were performed in 48 patients: 40% of those intubated and 6% of all patients. The mean postburn day for tracheotomy was day 15. There was no difference in the mortality rate for patients with an endotracheal tube only and those who had a tracheotomy as well: 42% and 37%, respectively. The prolonged length of stay for patients with a tracheotomy relates to the severity of the burn. Tracheotomy was not the cause of death in any patient. The strategy of grafting the neck before tracheotomy was used successfully in eight patients.\r"

The most notable of these deficiencies was the presence of high levels of bacterial contamination that could predispose to infect in the water of one public hot tub. The results of this study indicate that the Virginia Board of Health sanitary code for pool water must be revised immediately and should include all public hydrotherapy and swimming pools. Other states and communities may want to assess their codes for swimming pools and hydrotherapy tubs to avoid deficiencies that could be detrimental to public health.\r"

The pulse oximeter predicted \"adequate\" ventilation in 78% of patients with a readout of 99% or above. The arterial PO2 was greater than or equal to 90 torr in 90% of patients with oximetric readouts greater than or equal to 98% and in 10% of patients with readouts less than 95%.

In an effort to prevent childhood injuries, the Hennepin County Burn Center began a joint venture with a public health agency to reduce home hazards for children less than 6 years of age who were treated at the burn center. Children were referred to a public health nurse for a home safety assessment. During the initial visit, child hazards were identified and recommendations were made for reducing injury risk. Parental compliance with recommendations was evaluated during a second home visit approximately 1 month later. Home safety assessments were completed in 21 homes, and a total of 131 recommendations were made. Burn prevention recommendations accounted for 43.5% of the total recommendations, poison control recommendations accounted for 36.6%, and other injury control recommendations accounted for 19.9%. Parents complied with 43.5% of the total 131 recommendations. Burn prevention recommendations had a compliance rate of 42%. Poison control recommendations had the highest rate of compliance at 58%. Other injury control recommendations had a compliance rate of 19%. The program had a positive effect on reducing home hazards. It was an appropriate response by practitioners already involved in the care of children, many of whom are at risk of injury.\r"

  ".W": "Transient neonatal thyroid disease is known to occur as a result of transplacental passage of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) that contains antibodies to the TSH receptor (TRAb). Thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) produces hyperthyroidism, and antibody that blocks TSH binding (TBIAb) results in hypothyroidism. We have analyzed in detail the IgG from four women who gave birth to children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism and have shown stimulating and inhibiting antibodies to coexist in three. Human and/or rat thyroid (FRTL5) cells were used to show stimulatory effects in vitro. Inhibition was assessed as prevention of stimulation of these cells (by TSH or TSAb) or by the blocking of binding of [125I] TSH to its receptor. The IgG from two mothers was tested to identify whether the inhibitory and stimulating bioactivities resided in molecules characterized by either or both kappa- or lambda-light chains. Evidence for restricted heterogeneity (implying oligoclonality) was obtained, in that with one, purely inhibitory IgG all activity was with IgG kappa. With the other, stimulating and inhibitory activities were predominantly in IgG kappa and IgG lambda, respectively. In addition, the latter IgG contained a second stimulator that was not suppressed by either its own or other inhibitory IgG. Despite the presence of stimulatory antibodies in these IgG, the clinical effect was neonatal hypothyroidism, reflecting the greater potency of the inhibitory IgG in all instances. Based on the histories of these four women and their offspring it is apparent that TRAb, and in particular TBIAb, can develop at any point in the course of autoimmune thyroid disease, i.e. either at the onset or long after the autoimmune process has been established.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of CRH and somatostatin (SRIH) on adenylate cyclase (AC) activity, intracellular free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) and in vitro ACTH release were investigated in six human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas. In all tumors, CRH induced a marked stimulation (from 69-210% at 10 nM), whereas SRIH caused a definite inhibition (from 29-50% at 100 nM) of membrane AC. When added together, CRH and SRIH caused a purely additive effect on AC. In adenomatous corticotrophs CRH (10 nM) caused [Ca2+]i to rise from 160 +/- 30 nM (mean +/- SD) to 410 +/- 95 nM. CRH-induced transients were biphasic, with an initial peak predominantly due to redistribution from intracellular Ca2+ stores and a secondary phase due to Ca2+ influx. The effects of CRH on [Ca2+]i were totally independent of the stimulation of AC. In fact, cAMP-elevating agents other than CRH did not modify [Ca2+]i. SRIH (100 nM) decreased resting [Ca2+]i (approximately 20-40%) as well as [Ca2+]i rises induced by CRH, arginine vasopressin, or high K+. The effect of SRIH on [Ca2+]i was maintained in presence of high cAMP levels, while was totally abolished after pertussis toxin pretreatment. CRH (10 nM) stimulated ACTH release (from 22.5 +/- 3.5 to 45.0 +/- 8.5 pmol/L) by an extent similar to that elicited by calcium ionophore and forskolin. By contrast, SRIH (0.1 microM) inhibited both basal and CRH-stimulated ACTH release. In conclusion, in human adenomatous corticotrophs SRIH exerts an inhibitory action by reducing both AC activity and, independently, [Ca2+]i. In this way, SRIH can efficiently counteract the stimulatory action of CRH that in these cells involves activation of both cAMP and Ca2+ pathways.\r"

  ".U": "90243822\r", 
  ".W": "Assessment of adrenal reserve and the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency by acute adrenocortical stimulation with ACTH-(1-24) has been well established. Alternatively, estimation of adrenocortical enzymatic activities by this method for the detection of inherited or acquired biosynthetic abnormalities has been less well characterized. Some of the discrepancies between studies estimating adrenocortical enzymatic activities in different pathological conditions (e.g. hyperandrogenism) may result from the different stimulation protocols used. The objective of this prospective study was to establish the inherent variability of the adrenal response to acute ACTH-(1-24) stimulation and to determine the effect of sampling time, stimulation dose, and subject weight on the same. Forty-one normal female volunteers were recruited (mean age, 29.1 yr), 30 within 90-110% ideal body weight and 11 weighing more than 120% ideal body weight. Three protocols were designed to study 1) the effects of sampling time, ACTH-(1-24) dose, and subject weight on adrenal response; 2) the effect of time of the day on the variability of basal steroid levels and the adrenal response to stimulation; and 3) the long term reproducibility of the adrenal response to ACTH-(1-24). Androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and cortisol were measured in serum under basal and stimulated conditions. All subjects had normal basal levels of testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and PRL. The acute iv administration of 0.10, 0.25, and 1.0 mg ACTH-(1-24) elicited similar and maximal steroid responses, with all steroid levels reaching a plateau 60-90 min poststimulation regardless of subject weight. Sampling of basal steroid levels every 5 min in the morning (AM; beginning 0700-0900 h) or evening (PM; 1500-1700 h) did not reveal any difference in steroid variability. Only the mean basal cortisol level was higher in AM than PM testing (P less than 0.03). Although the mean levels of dehydroepiandrosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone 60 min after stimulation were significantly higher in AM than PM studies, these differences were minimal. Ten volunteers underwent an average of four (range, 2-6) adrenal stimulation studies using 1.0 mg ACTH-(1-24) over a 1-yr period. The long term coefficient of variation (CV) for basal steroid levels ranged from 15-28%. Calculations of net adrenal response (delta steroid O-T and area delta steroid O-T) were less reproducible (CV, 0-82%) than measures of absolute response (steroid T, area steroid T, and %steroid T; CV, 7-32%). This difference in CV between the measures of net and absolute adrenal responses was significant for all steroids except androstenedione.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Although in normal human serum most of immunoreactive material was present as the large mol wt complex (150K), considerable amounts of smaller components were found by high performance liquid exclusion chromatography in the 60K, 42K, and 32K range. Normal serum levels were low at birth, rose sharply during the first weeks of life, and showed a moderate peak at puberty. To assess the diagnostic efficacy of SmBP for GH deficiency (GHD), patients previously diagnosed as GH-deficient by conventional criteria (n = 132) were compared to short statured children without GHD (n = 130). Taking the fifth centile as a limit of normality the majority of patients with GHD had subnormal levels, yielding high sensitivity of the test (0.97). In contrast, most of the non-GH-deficient children had SmBP levels within the normal range, resulting in high specificity (0.95) and, consequently, high accuracy (0.96). These results suggest that the large mol wt SmBP is an excellent screening parameter and is highly informative for GHD.\r"

We studied a possible in vivo regulation of expression of this gene by looking for FAS RNA in human endometrial biopsies at various periods of the menstrual cycle, using a cloned cDNA FAS probe. By Northern blot analysis, we detected the 8-kilobase FAS RNA throughout the cycle in 7 uterine samples. RNA in situ hybridization analysis of frozen sections from 22 endometrial biopsies showed that FAS RNA was present during follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle in stromal and epithelial cells. RNA levels were quantified by counting autoradiographic silver grains using a computer-aided image analyzer. FAS RNA levels were significantly higher in epithelial cells than in fibroblasts (P less than 2 x 10(-5]. Furthermore, in both cell types, mean FAS RNA concentrations were higher in biopsies removed during the luteal phase than the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (P = 2 x 10(-3) and 9 x 10(-5), respectively). A 2- to 3-fold increase in FAS RNA levels between days 8-14 and days 22-24 was detected in 2 normal patients who had previously undergone 2 successive biopsies. This increase was not observed in 2 patients with low plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations, indicating a probable dysovulation. We conclude that FAS normally increases in both stromal and epithelial endometrial cells during the luteal phase. This increase is probably due to progesterone, which implies that FAS is induced in normal endometrium, as demonstrated in breast cancer.\r"

The complete exonic sequence of the patient's CYP17 (P45017 alpha) gene revealed a seven-basepair duplication (GCGCACA) in exon 2 which leads to a frame shift and, subsequently, a premature stop codon. Because this stop codon occurs N-terminal to the heme-binding sequence, the presence of this mutation leads to the absence of a functional P45017 alpha-protein in adrenal cortex and testis. This, in turn, leads to an absence of sex steroids and excessive secretion of steroids with mineralocorticoid activity and, consequently, female external genitalia and hypertension in this 46XY patient.\r"

  ".W": "The bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine (L1-L4) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (Hologic QDR 1000) in 135 healthy caucasian children, aged 1-15 yr, and values were correlated with age, height, weight, body surface, bone age, pubertal status, calcium intake, vitamin D supplementation, and serum bone gla protein. BMD increased with age in children of both sexes (r = 0.88; P less than 0.001) from 0.446 +/- 0.048 g/cm2 at 1 yr to 0.625 +/- 0.068 g/cm2 at 10 yr and 0.891 +/- 0.123 g/cm2 at 15 yr of age. The increase was steeper at the time of puberty, reaching values above 0.80 g/cm2 after puberty was achieved. There were no significant differences between boys and girls, except at the age of 12 yr when BMD was higher in girls than in boys (P = 0.007), probably because of the earlier onset of puberty in females. BMD was also highly correlated with height, weight, body surface, and bone age. BMD was not correlated with calcium intake when age was held constant, nor with vitamin D supplementation. Serum bone gla protein showed a steady increase during childhood, with peak values at 11-12 yr of age, and was weakly but significantly correlated with BMD (r = 0.27; P = 0.007). Because of low irradiation exposure, rapid scanning, and high precision, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry is a noninvasive method which is well adapted to the child. It should be helpful in the investigation and follow-up of children with diseases impairing bone metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "In an earlier 8-day study, we showed increased immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) levels in young adults fed high phosphorus (P), low calcium (Ca) diets assembled from common grocery foods, a dietary pattern characteristic of teens and young adults. Because animals fed high P, low Ca diets developed secondary hyperparathyroidism and, ultimately, osteopenia, perhaps the typical teen diet may reduce peak bone mass and contribute to osteoporotic fracture later in life. To determine if the elevation in iPTH levels and action persists with chronic intake of this typical diet, we studied the 24-h mineral and hormone responses of 15 young women (18-25 yr of age) to either high P, low Ca or control diets. Each subject served as her own control, first consuming a basal diet (800 mg Ca, 900 mg P) for 28 days; 10 women were then switched to the high P, low Ca test diet (400 mg Ca, 1700 mg P) for 28 days, while the remaining 5 women in the control group continued eating the basal diet. On days 28 and 56, all subjects were studied as inpatients for 24 h, with blood drawn every 4 h and collection of fasting and 24-h urine. Serum iPTH (midregion) and serum intact PTH (2-site immunoradiometric assay) increased significantly [maximal increases of 26% (P less than 0.002) and 36% (P less than 0.004), respectively] after 4 weeks of consuming the test diet, and there was no change in the control group. In contrast to our 8-day study, plasma levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D did not change in either group. Our findings suggest that this common dietary pattern in young adult women causes persistent alterations in calcium-regulating hormones that could be unfavorable to achieving maximal positive bone balance.\r"

Results were compared with those from 2 mothers with known primary myxedema (atrophic thyroiditis) whose babies had transient CH and with normal controls. Only 1 prospectively evaluated CH mother had potent TSH binding inhibitory, growth inhibitory, and function inhibitory IgGs. Further study of this discordant mother's serum indicated that she was hypothyroid, probably due to atrophic thyroiditis. Both mothers with known primary myxedema had blocking IgGs. The thyroid growth-blocking activity was verified by cell count, could be absorbed by and eluted from Staphylococcal protein-A, indicating that it was an IgG, and was not an anti-TSH idiotype. Half-maximal inhibition was similar in the three different assays for thyroid-blocking activity, suggesting that TSH binding inhibitory, growth inhibitory, and function inhibitory IgGs in some patients with primary myxedema may be the same antibody population. There was no correlation with the titer of antimicrosomal antibodies. These data suggest that maternal thyroid-blocking IgGs interacting with the TSH receptor do not play a role in most cases of sporadic CH. Determination of TSH binding inhibitory IgGs, but not antimicrosomal antibodies, is a sensitive screening test for the presence of TSH receptor-blocking antibodies.\r"

The assay shows relative specificity for higher primate species. Whereas amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and seminal plasma contain virtually no immunoreactive alpha-subunit, the protein is easily detectable in 0.5-microL serum samples. Serum alpha-subunit levels are markedly age dependent, rising over 5-fold from birth to puberty, then remaining relatively constant throughout adulthood. In 170 children, there was a strong association between alpha-subunit and IGFBP-3 levels. Mean alpha-subunit levels (+/- SD) in adults were 24.2 +/- 4.7 mg/L in 93 normal subjects, 54.1 +/- 15.5 mg/L in 12 acromegalics, 6.5 +/- 4.8 mg/L in 10 GH-deficient subjects, and 31.5 +/- 5.7 mg/L in 18 third term pregnant women. In serum fractionated by gel chromatography, alpha-subunit appeared as a broad 100-150K peak. After depleting serum samples of IGFBP-3 by immunoaffinity chromatography, approximately one third of alpha-subunit remained, in a peak of about 100K, suggesting that two thirds of the total alpha-subunit in serum is present in the approximately 150K complex, and one third is uncomplexed. Development of this RIA for alpha-subunit will allow further study of regulation of the GH-dependent complex.\r"

Specific properties of pulsatile GH release were quantitated by Cluster analysis, and Fourier expansion time series analysis was used to resolve fixed periodicities underlying GH secretion. Compared with sex-matched controls, 24-h integrated GH concentrations (IGHC; min.mg/L) were elevated 15-fold in the acromegalic men (40 +/- 27 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.35; P = 0.02) and 10-fold in the acromegalic women (43 +/- 19 vs. 4.1 +/- 0.35; P = 0.01). The increase in integrated GH concentrations was accounted for by an increase in the nonpulsatile fraction [men, 31 +/- 20 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.001); women, 35 +/- 14 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.0008)]; the pulsatile component was not different from that in normal subjects. Acromegalics had an increased number of pulses per 24 h [men, 17 +/- 1.5 vs. 6.7 +/- 1.4 (P = 0.0001); women, 19 +/- 1.6 vs. 11 +/- 1.0 (P = 0.002)] and increased basal GH concentrations [men, interpulse valley mean, 22 +/- 14 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.30 micrograms/L (P = 0.0006); women, 27 +/- 12 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.20 micrograms/L (P = 0.0001)]. The proportion of the mean GH concentration attributable to 24-h rhythmicity was decreased in the acromegalic patients. Five patients studied during biochemical remission (4 after transsphenoidal surgery and 1 during bromocriptine therapy) had GH profiles that resembled those of normal subjects. Pulsatile GH secretion in acromegaly is characterized by augmented basal GH concentrations, increased GH pulse frequency, and an attenuation of the underlying 24-h rhythm. Such a pattern may be secondary to the intrinsic pathology of adenomatous somatotrophs and/or the effects of altered hypothalamic regulation.\r"

  ".W": "In man, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) and somatostatin-28 (S-28) levels increase after ingestion of a mixed meal. Both peptides originate from the gastrointestinal tract. In supra- and periphysiological doses, CCK stimulates the release of somatostatin-14 from in vitro pancreatic islets and gastric cells and increases circulating somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in dogs, leading to the conjecture that CCK regulates somatostatin-like immunoreactivity secretion. Nonetheless, whether CCK is responsible in part for the meal-induced rise in S-28 in man has not been established. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine if CCK, at both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations, increases the circulating levels of prosomatostatin (proS)-derived peptides in humans. On 3 separate days, five healthy men ate a mixed liquid meal or received iv infusions of CCK at rates of 18 or 38 pmol/kg.h. Plasma levels of pro-S-derived peptides, including pro-S, S-14, S-13, S-28, and CCK, were measured. Basal CCK levels averaged 0.9 +/- 0.1 pmol/L and increased after the meal to a peak level of 5.4 +/- 1.5 pmol/L and averaged 3.1 +/- 1.2 pmol/L over 90 min. The mean basal levels of pro-S, S-14, and S-13, measured collectively, was 6.1 +/- 0.4 pmol/L eq S14 and was unaltered by food intake. The S-28 level was 6.7 +/- 0.6 pmol/L and rose to a zenith of 13.1 +/- 3.3 pmol/L by 90 min. Infusion of CCK at 18 and 38 pmol/kg.h produced steady state plasma CCK levels of 4.1 +/- 1.1 and 9.9 +/- 1.5 pmol/L, respectively. Basal levels of pro-S-derived peptides were unaltered during the infusion of either the low or high dose of CCK. We conclude that CCK by itself is not a physiological signal to the release of pro-S-derived peptides in man.\r"

Testicular tumors in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been thought to be adrenal rests, but no conclusive evidence supporting the hypothesis has been presented. We report a morphological and biochemical analysis of a patient with 21-hydroxylase deficiency who developed bilateral nodular hyperplasia of steroid-secreting tissue within the testis, despite suppression therapy with both exogenous glucocorticoids and testosterone. The tissue was formed of confluent nodules of homogenous cells. Electron microscopy showed the cells to have abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum, well developed Golgi apparatus, and mitochondria with predominantly tubular cristae, features characteristic of steroid-secreting cells of adrenocortical origin. Crystals of Reinke were not observed. Functional studies in vivo showed a marked response to ACTH infusion, with 17-hydroxyprogesterone rising from 56 to 13,500 ng/mL, cortisol from less than 2 to 19 micrograms/dL, and testosterone from 369 to 629 ng/dL, with an attendant increase in testicular size and pain over 48 h. Receptor studies in vitro revealed no gonadotropin receptors, but abundant angiotensin-II receptors. Enzyme activity analysis in vitro showed undetectable 21-hydroxylase activity and an enzyme profile consistent with adrenocortical cells rather than Leydig cells. Based on these morphological and biochemical findings, we conclude that the nodular steroidogenic tissue that replaced this patient's testes was of adrenal origin. The study documents for the first time the development of adrenocortical tumors from adrenal rest tissue within the testis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the adrenostatic potential of a nonhypnotic low dose etomidate infusion, we administered 0.03 mg/kg etomidate in a bolus injection, followed by constant infusion of 0.3 mg/kg.h for 24 h to 6 patients with severe Cushing's syndrome. The dose-response relationship also was determined in 15 normal subjects. Three groups of 5 received, respectively, doses of 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg.h etomidate for 5 h after an initial bolus dose of 0.03 mg/kg. The response to exogenously administered ACTH [0.25 mg ACTH-(1-24)], injected after the etomidate or control infusion, was determined in all normal subjects. In the six hypercortisolemic patients, serum cortisol concentrations decreased from 1374 +/- 436 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM) to 188 +/- 91 nmol/L after 11 h of etomidate infusion and remained low until the end of the infusion. Cortisol levels returned to pretreatment concentrations by 24 h. Excretion of urinary free cortisol decreased from 1180 +/- 196 to 185 +/- 66 nmol/day. In the normal subjects, administration of etomidate led to a dose-dependent decrease in serum cortisol from about 550 to 83 nmol/L, while 11-deoxycortisol rose from low or undetectable levels up to 346 nmol/L. In response to ACTH, cortisol levels rose in inverse proportion to the etomidate dose. It was, however, significantly reduced compared to normal saline infusion even after the lowest dose. Changes in aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations were similar to those in cortisol, and 11-deoxycorticosterone changed in a pattern similar to that of 11-deoxycortisol. Two of five normal subjects reported tiredness during the highest etomidate infusion. No other side-effects were noted. We conclude that iv administered etomidate in a low nonhypnotic dose reduces serum cortisol concentrations in a dose-dependent manner in both hyper- and eucortisolemic subjects. This study suggests that etomidate at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.h or lower may be an effective strategy for the control of severe hypercortisolemia.\r"

To study its regulation in normal mammary glands, the FAS level was estimated by immunohistochemistry, using the biotin-streptavidin method, in ducts and lobules of normal tissues adjacent to nonproliferative benign breast lesions collected by biopsy. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human FAS specifically recognized the 250-kDa FAS from MCF7 cells, as shown by Western immunoblotting. An excess of purified FAS totally switched off FAS immunostaining of R5020-treated MCF7 cells, demonstrating the validity of FAS immunocytochemical detection. FAS labeling was quantified using a computer-aided image analyzer (SAMBA 2005) in 18 patients receiving progestin therapy from the 15th to the 25th day of the menstrual cycle and 26 untreated patients. In the 2 groups, FAS staining, absent of fibroblasts, was observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. It was higher in lobules than in ducts and increased significantly from the follicular to the luteal phase in both structures. Progestin treatment increased FAS expression in both structures. Using monoclonal antibodies, progesterone receptor expression was measured in frozen serial sections. In patients receiving progestin treatment, the progesterone receptor level increased from the beginning of the cycle to day 14 and then decreased during the second part of the menstrual cycle, probably down-regulated by progestin, indicating a regulation similar to that in the endometrium. We conclude that FAS is induced by progestins in the ducts and lobules of human normal mammary glands as it is in human breast cancer cells. FAS may, therefore, be useful for studying the effect of progesterone in normal human mammary glands.\r"

  ".W": "Blacks are known to have a higher bone mass than whites and have recently been found to have significantly different levels of calcitropic hormones and other biochemical indices of calcium metabolism. To assess the possible significance of these biochemical differences to interracial differences in bone mass, we have undertaken an assessment of indices of calcium metabolism in Polynesian subjects, since they also have a higher bone mass than whites. Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were slightly lower in Polynesians than in whites (65 +/- 5 vs. 95 +/- 10 nmol/L; P less than 0.02), but there were no differences between the groups in serum levels of calcium (total and ionized), phosphate, magnesium, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTH, calcitonin, alkaline phosphatase activity, and bone gla-protein. Furthermore, urinary excretion of hydroxyproline, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, and potassium and the tubular maximum for the reabsorption of phosphate were not different between whites and Polynesians. Intestinal strontium absorption was similar in the two groups. In contrast, distal forearm bone mineral content was higher in Polynesians (P less than 0.01) and midupper arm muscle area was also increased in this group (P less than 0.005). It is concluded that the higher bone mass of Polynesians cannot be attributed to alterations in the basal levels of calcitropic hormones, but may be related to their greater muscle mass. It is probable that the previously observed black-white differences in the vitamin D endocrine system are secondary to the effects of skin color on vitamin D synthesis and are not contributory to the lower bone mass of whites.\r"

The PTH-induced rise in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D was significantly smaller in the hyperparathyroid patients than in either the controls or the hypercalciuric patients. The rise in serum calcium was similar in all 3 groups. The hyperparathyroid subjects had higher basal fractional phosphate excretion than the other two groups. PTH failed to increase fractional phosphate excretion in the hyperparathyroid individuals, whereas there was a statistically significant increase in the other two groups. PTH was without significant effect on urinary calcium excretion in any of the three groups. There were no discernible differences between the responses of the hypercalciuric patients and those of the normal subjects. These findings suggest that while responses to PTH are normal in hypercalciuria, some hyperparathyroid patients are resistant to exogenous PTH. This resistance is limited to specific arms of the PTH response pathway and may not involve PTH receptors.\r"

We undertook this study because alprazolam is the only benzodiazepine effective in treating both major depressive and anxiety disorders, and recent data suggest that the hypercortisolism of major depression reflects hypersecretion of CRH. Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of CRH can reproduce many of the components of the symptom complex of major depression, including not only hypercortisolism, but also hypothalamic hypogonadism, decreased libido, anorexia, and intense anxiety. As a comparison, we also assessed the effects of diazepam on in vitro CRH release, because in contrast to alprazolam, diazepam is effective in anxiety states but not in depression. Alprazolam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both plasma ACTH and cortisol secretion in non-restrained adult male rhesus monkeys. Our in vitro studies showed that alprazolam significantly inhibited serotonin (5HT)-induced CRH release in a dose-dependent fashion (10(-10)-10(-5) M). Diazepam also inhibited 5HT-induced CRH release, but was 40 times less potent than alprazolam. Alprazolam was ineffective in blocking basal or CRH-induced ACTH release from rat dispersed anterior pituicytes, suggesting that its in vivo effects are through inhibition of CRH secretion. As expected, the inactive benzodiazepine ligand Ro 15-1788 inhibited the effects of alprazolam on 5HT-induced CRH release, but this occurred only at doses below 10(-7) M. Interestingly, when incubated alone in higher doses with our rat hypothalamic organ culture, Ro 15-1788, like alprazolam, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 5HT-induced CRH release (10(-7)-10(-5) M), suggesting an agonistic action of Ro 15-1788 at the benzodiazepine receptor at higher concentrations. We conclude that alprazolam is capable of suppressing the primate pituitary-adrenal axis, and that this suppression most likely reflects suppression of the CRH neuron rather than of the pituitary corticotroph cell. We speculate that the enhanced capacity of alprazolam to suppress the CRH neuron relative to other benzodiazepines may contribute to its unique efficacy among this class of drugs in the treatment of major depression. The capacity of Ro 15-1788 to reverse alprazolam-induced suppression of the CRH neuron indicates that the effects of alprazolam are mediated at least in part via its interaction with the benzodiazepine component of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA macromolecular complex.\r"

  ".W": "A hidden pool of rT3 production represents a source of rT3 that is minimally reflected in circulating rT3 levels. To test for the existence of such a source of rT3 production in man, varying doses of the generalized deiodinase inhibitor iopanoic acid (IA) were administered to four hyperthyroxinemic subjects. The doses employed included low-IA (0.5-g load, then 0.5 g/day for 5 days), mid-IA (1.0-g load, then 1.0 g/day for 5 days), and high-IA (3.0-g load, then 3.0 g/day for 5 days). Each patient received 25 microCi [125I]rT3, iv, in the high T4 state and on day 3 of each IA dosing regimen. Serial blood and urine samples were obtained to determine serum rT3 clearance rates and the urinary thyronine metabolite patterns. Although total serum rT3 values were increased by all IA dosages (P less than 0.001), rT3 was lower with high-IA administration (P less than 0.02) than with low- or mid-IA regimens. Low-IA decreased rT3 clearance to 33 +/- 2 L/day (P less than 0.005), while increasing the daily rT3 production to 76 +/- 8 nmol/day (P less than 0.04) compared to the control values (150 +/- 10 L/day and 53 +/- 8 nmol/day, respectively). Mid-IA also reduced rT3 clearance (23 +/- 4 L/day; P less than 0.005) without changing rT3 production (50 +/- 10 nmol/day), while high-IA reduced both rT3 clearance (21 +/- 2 L/day; P less than 0.005) and production (39 +/- 9 nmol/day; P less than 0.04). Intravenously administered tracer rT3 could not be detected in the urine in the high T4 state, but rT3 could not be detected in the urine in the high T4 state, but was prominent after IA administration. It is concluded that a hidden pool of rT3 production exists in vivo in man. Further, low dose IA serves as a selective inhibitor of liver and kidney deiodinase systems, allowing reflection of this hidden rT3 pool in the blood and urine. It would appear that hypertrophy of this hidden pool of rT3 production occurs in high T4 states and may account for the majority of the unrecognized deiodinative metabolites of T4 generated in hyperthyroxinemia.\r"

Our patient showed clinical and histopathologic findings typical of both erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease. The patient also had a positive Raji cell assay, which demonstrates the presence of a circulating immune complex. Increased levels of circulating immune complexes have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and the gastrointestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease could lead to enhanced antigenic exposure and increased formation of immune complexes. We contend that inflammatory bowel disease may have contributed to the development of erythema elevatum diutinum in our patient.\r"

We describe a 31-year-old man seropositive for human T lymphotropic virus type I who had diabetic ketoacidosis with zygomycosis confined to the right arm. The lesion was presumed initially to be a bacterial infection but did not respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy. The arm lesion was cultured, and Rhizopus arrhizus was isolated. The patient responded well to a combination of amphotericin B and extensive surgical debridements.

  ".W": "A time and labor cost study was conducted to evaluate two quantitative techniques for recording dietary intake of individuals: the Nutrition Evaluation Scale System (NESSy) and the weighed food record. NESSy, a new computerized method, uses interactive software to prompt and guide participants through the recording of food weights and descriptions. Twelve men and nine women (aged 23 to 36 years, with 11 to 16 years of education) utilized NESSy for 16 consecutive days while residing in a metabolic research unit. Concurrently, food intake was weighed and manually recorded by trained dietary staff. Analysis of variance on data gathered from NESSy showed no statistically significant differences among sex, age, and educational groupings in the time spent using NESSy. NESSy required 1.73 +/- 0.3 minutes (mean +/- SD) to weigh in, weigh out, and record each food item consumed, whereas the manual technique required 8.4 minutes. The reason for the magnitude of time difference between the two methods is that NESSy provides the flexibility of weighing and recording only foods eaten whereas the manual method requires complete entry of all foods served whether eaten or not. Using the Nutrition Evaluation Scale System to record food intake provides savings in time and labor of about 80%.\r"

  ".W": "Data were collected from home interviews of 424 noninstitutionalized individuals, 58 to 100 years old, in the Houston metropolitan area, to assess the relationships between dietary intake, socioeconomic variables, beliefs about nutrition, and use of nutritional supplements. Two-thirds of the subjects took nutritional supplements. The most common forms were vitamin C, calcium, and multivitamins. With the exception of vitamin B-6, magnesium, and dietary fiber, which were higher in diets of users of nutritional supplements than in diets of nonusers, nutrient density (amount of nutrient per 1,000 kcal) did not differ between the two groups. Attitudes toward the use of nutritional supplements, health foods, and/or nutritional quality of conventional foods differed with sex, age, income, and educational level. Nutrient intake of those with more positive feelings about nutritional supplements was higher, perhaps as a result of increased awareness of diet and health. Nutrition education that is targeted to issues of interest to people in this age group is needed; topics such as the role of nutrients in disease prevention and appropriate nutritional supplementation might be explored. This survey indicates that, although the practice of supplementation may be beneficial to augment nutritional quality of the diet for elderly people, use of nutritional supplements is not restricted to those whose dietary intake is of lower nutrient density than that of nonusers.\r"

  ".U": "90243998\r", 
  ".W": "Proximate composition, minerals, fatty acids, and sterols were determined for eight species of shellfish commonly marketed in the Northwest. Moisture and total lipid content varied with the size of the species, with more variation in mollusca than in crustacea; total lipid content ranged from 0.7% in sea scallops to 3.1% in blue mussels but only from 1.2% in Dungeness crab to 1.3% in pink shrimp. The mineral content was highly variable; the mineral content of Northwest samples tended to be lower than that reported in other studies. Generally, shellfish are good sources of zinc, and Pacific oysters, blue mussels, and Manila clams are also good sources of iron. Five fatty acids (16:0, 16:1, 18:1, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3) represented from 60% to 84% of the fatty acid content. Palmitic acid ranged from 13% to 32% of the total fatty acids. Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were predominant (37.6% to 54.3%), with sea scallops containing more than 50%; n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ranged from 1.5% to 6.5%. In crustacea, cholesterol was the primary sterol, and brassicasterol was the only other measurable sterol. In all mollusca except California squid, cholesterol averaged 37 mg/100 gm and ranged from 23% to 39% of the total sterols. In squid, cholesterol, at 231 mg/100 gm, was the only measurable sterol. We conclude that shellfish vary widely in their nutrient content but, in general, are valuable additions to the diet.\r"

The Dietitians in Nutrition Support (DNS) Practice Group examined these changes using a survey sent to 1,000 clinical nutrition managers at American Hospital Association (AHA) hospitals. The goals of the survey were (a) to evaluate changes in billing for nutrition services and (b) to evaluate changes in resources available to dietetics staff members. Although income from nutrition services to inpatients had increased only 18% since 1984, 45% of respondents reported an increase in payment for outpatient services. Prior to 1984, larger hospitals reported screening for malnutrition more often than smaller hospitals, and the responsibility for screening was handled more often by dietetic technicians than by RDs. Larger hospitals also reported establishment of a home nutrition support company more often than smaller hospitals. Computer and academic course costs were paid more frequently by nonprofit and tertiary hospitals. Although the number of hospitals billing for nutrition services to patients was small, most reported receiving payment. We conclude that charges for nutrition services by dietitians to outpatients have increased, and that most dietitians who bill for services receive payment. Academic and technological resources for RDs have increased in general, though smaller primary-care and for-profit hospitals report such supports less consistently than larger, tertiary-care, and not-for-profit hospitals.\r"

Questionnaires were mailed to 296 coaches of senior and junior colleges in North Carolina using a listing from the National Directory of College Athletics. Coaches of the following sports were included: track and field, cross country, swimming, tennis, basketball, gymnastics, golf, football, and wrestling. The response rate was 36%. Seventy percent of the 15 nutrition knowledge test items were answered correctly; however, only one-third of the coaches indicated a high degree of certainty for the correctness of their responses. There were no significant relationships between nutrition knowledge and sex, age, collegiate conference, course work in nutrition, win/loss record, and years of coaching experience. Major dietary problems of college athletes reported by coaches were consumption of \"junk food,\" poor eating habits, and consumption of an unbalanced diet. The authors recommend an annual workshop for coaches, trainers, and dietitians to develop criteria for nutrition assessment and body composition for college athletes and to develop training diets. Special workshops for foodservice personnel are also recommended.\r"

We administered to 24-month-old C57BL/6Nnia mice pharmacological compounds known to improve retention in young mice. Eleven of the pharmacological agents improved retention in old mice at the dose previously shown to be optimal in young mice. Clonidine and ST 587, the two alpha noradrenergic agonists tested, failed to enhance retention at the optimum dose for young mice. A dose response study with clonidine found that a lower dose (1 mg/kg) improved retention in old mice rather than the optimal dose (3 mg/kg) for young mice. These data suggest that memory retention in old C57BL/6Nnia mice is similar to that of young mice, with the exception of alpha noradrenergic receptors.\r"

PMA receptor number and affinity were normal. Protein kinase C (PKC) translocation to the membrane was normal but its activation was reduced. PMA-induced total endogenous phosphorylation and phosphorylation of individual proteins showed no age-related differences as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. These minimal alterations in neutrophil function contrast with the much more significant decrements in superoxide generation and calcium homeostasis noted when neutrophils from old volunteers are stimulated by chemotactic peptide formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine (FMLP) (Lipschitz et al., 1988). It is well recognized that phorbol activates the cell through a mechanism that bypasses the membrane-receptor. Taken together with our observations with FMLP, these results point to a membrane-associated deficiency in the signal transduction pathway, most likely through receptor coupling or alterations in membrane lipids. They also demonstrate that there is not an overall reduction of metabolic responses in neutrophils from the elderly.\r"

Calcium response was reduced in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, after stimulation with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody over a broad range of concentrations. Experiments carried out in the presence of EGTA indicate that both calcium mobilization from internal stores and extracellular calcium influx were reduced. The reduced overall response was in part due to a decreased number of responding cells in aged animals. In contrast, the [Ca2+]i response produced by the crosslinking of Thy1 and Ly1 (CD5) surface molecules did not show significant differences between young and old mice, indicating that some signaling mechanisms are intact in aged animals. These data also suggest that there are substantial differences between humans and mice in age-related changes in signal transduction.\r"

A large proportion of hip fracture patients do not regain pre-fracture PADL and IADL levels; most recovery in walking ability and ability to perform PADL and IADLs occurs by 6 months. Those who are older, have longer hospital stays, and are rehospitalized, exhibit poorer recovery, as do those displaying chronic or acute cognitive deficits and depressive symptomatology while hospitalized. Also, contact with one's social network following hospital discharge is associated with greater recovery. Findings point to the importance of psychosocial factors for recovery and suggest areas where hospital-based interventions and discharge planning efforts should focus.\r"

In the very old patients, the frequency of T lymphocytes was significantly lower than in young adults. This decrease was attributed more to the CD8-positive than to CD4-positive cell subset, leading to generally high CD4/CD8 ratios. The mitogenic responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A), but not pokeweed mitogen (PWM), were decreased significantly in cultures with isolated lymphocytes, while in whole blood cultures the responses to PHA and PWM but not to Con A were reduced. In very advanced age, there was a significant decrease in the number of B cells, and the ability to produce IgM in vitro was decreased. During the follow-up time, 15 out of the 18 patients died. However, their lifetime was not in correlation with any single immune parameter.\r"

Therefore this prospective study was conducted to establish an approach to operationalizing DSM-III criteria and to determine the incidence and prevalence of delirium. Two hundred thirty-five consecutive subjects age 70 and over admitted to general medicine underwent daily standardized screening. Patients with low scores on screening tests or clinical evidence suggestive of any psychiatric disorder and controls were seen by a psychiatrist, who determined whether delirium was present by applying explicit operational definitions to each component of the DSM-III criteria for delirium. We conclude that the syndrome of delirium as defined by the American Psychiatric Association is prevalent on admission among elderly on general medical services, but the number of cases developing in the hospital is much less than often stated in the literature.\r"

  ".U": "90244070\r", 
  ".W": "The decline of strength with age has often been attributed to declining muscle mass in older subjects. To investigate factors which might influence changes in strength across the life span, grip strength and muscle mass (as estimated by creatinine excretion and forearm circumference) were measured in 847 healthy volunteers, aged 20-100 years, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Cross-sectional and longitudinal results concur that grip strength increases into the thirties and declines at an accelerating rate after age 40. However, the grip strength of 48% of subjects less than 40 years old, 29% of individuals 40-59 years old, and 15% of subjects older than 60 did not decline during the average 9-year follow-up. Grip strength is strongly correlated with muscle mass (r = .60, p less than .0001). However, using multiple regression analysis, grip strength is more strongly correlated with age (partial r2 = .38) than muscle mass (partial r2 = .16). Additionally, a residuals analysis demonstrates that younger subjects are stronger and older subjects are weaker than one would predict based on their muscular size. Thus, while strength losses are partially explained by declining muscle mass, there remain other yet undetermined factors beyond declining muscle mass to explain some of the loss of strength seen with aging.\r"

The step gain of vestibular post-rotary nystagmus did not differ across age groups, but the time constant of slow-phase velocity decay was longer and more asymmetrical in the older group. The slow-phase velocity of optokinetic nystagmus attained the same initial levels for both age groups; it declined significantly during 60 s of stimulation for the older but not the younger group. The decay rate of optokinetic afternystagmus was quicker for the older subjects. This pattern of results may be related to already identified structural changes in the vestibular system and suggests the existence of yet unidentified changes in central vestibular and visual processing.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism for the prolongation of P-R interval associated with advancing age is undefined. Using a high-resolution ECG (Marquette MAC-1) to signal average 512 cardiac cycles, we examined 185 healthy volunteers aged 20-83 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging with normal rest and exercise ECGs and a resting P-R interval less than 210 ms. Among the 161 subjects with visible His bundle activity, P-R interval increased with age (p less than .001). This increase was due entirely to prolongation of the interval between the P wave onset and His bundle potential, i.e., the P-H interval, (p less than .001) with no age-associated change in the H-V interval, p = NS. The P-H interval prolongation with age was localized to the P-R segment proximal to His bundle activation (p less than .001). In a separate group of 7 asymptomatic older men (mean age = 71 yr), with first-degree atrioventricular (A-V) block on standard ECG (mean PR = 238 +/- 14 ms), the P-H interval (193 +/- 21, vs 136 +/- 18 ms, p less than .001) and proximal P-R segment (82 +/- 19) vs 33 +/- 15 ms, p less than .001) but not the H-V interval (45 +/- 11 vs 40 +/- 9 ms, p = NS) were longer than in 25 age-matched men without A-V block. Thus, the modest age-associated prolongation of the P-R interval is localized to the proximal P-R segment, probably reflecting delay within the atrioventricular junction. A similar but more striking delay in the proximal P-R segment is responsible for first degree A-V block in apparently healthy older men.\r"

The goal of the present study was to identify genetic as well as environmental influences that contribute to an individual's motivation and ability to create and maintain social support systems during the second half of the life course. One of the most powerful behavioral genetic designs is the combined twin/adoption design which is used in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). A subsample of 424 pairs of twins age 50 and above was used: 64 pairs of identical twins reared apart, 95 pairs of identical twins reared together, 132 pairs of fraternal twins reared apart, and 133 pairs of fraternal twins reared together. The measure of social support assessed both the quantity of relationships as well as the perceived adequacy of the social support network. Model-fitting analyses verified the importance of genetic factors for perceived adequacy of the social support network, whereas little genetic influence was found for the quantity of social relationships.\r"

Utilizing a two-choice reaction time (RT) paradigm, movement complexity as a factor of response programming was varied in a microswitch pressing task by altering the number of sides of the body and the number of fingers controlled. The speed of response programming was found to be age dependent and to interact with movement complexity across age groups. The results confirmed that as movement complexity increases, the effects of adult aging on RT increase. This study further emphasizes the robustness of the movement complexity x age effect, in that older individuals were found to be much more sensitive to small changes in movement complexity than younger subjects. The comparison results of three adult age groups suggested this sensitivity to movement complexity is progressive over the adult life span.\r"

The experiment examined whether reduced response complexity would lead to equivalent consistent mapping search performance across age groups. Subjects received 2,240 training trials each for CM and VM versions of a hybrid memory/visual search task. During training two response conditions were used: (1) respond only when a target was present (Yes-only responding) and (2) respond only when a target was absent (No-only responding). Following initial training, subjects were transferred to the opposite response condition. During training the function relating reaction time to memory-set size differed between age groups only with CM practice, replicating age-related effects previously found for extensive CM practice. Response reversal (e.g., Yes-only to No-only) after training led to age-related transfer effects for both CM and VM search. Importantly, the transfer data suggest age-dependent controlled processing effects.\r"

Gains were matched by the younger men, however, so that age differences were not reduced. These improvements by the older men occurred under conditions of varied stimulus-response relations (as well as consistent relations), a procedure that has been regarded as especially taxing of the cognitive resources of older adults. Although the study did not provide evidence that age differences in recognition memory were reduced by reinforced practice, the equivalent practice effects and the transfer of these effects from visual to auditory stimuli indicated that the older men's learning abilities were the equal of those of the young adult controls.\r"

In conjunction with the recognition test, subjects were asked to indicate whether they perceived the faces as familiar on the basis of pre-experimental knowledge, and to select the correct name for each face in a four-alternative multiple-choice test. Results showed that both groups of subjects (a) perceived more dated than contemporary faces as familiar, and (b) performed better for dated than for contemporary faces in the name recognition task. This pattern of results indicates an advantage of dated over contemporary information as general knowledge for both groups of subjects. In the episodic face recognition task, normal older adults performed better for dated than for contemporary faces, whereas demented patients performed equally well for both types of faces. The overall pattern of outcome suggests that Alzheimer's disease is associated with a deficit in the ability to utilize task-relevant prior knowledge to enhance episodic remembering.\r"

Three significant canonical variates emerged for each type of support, instrumental and perceived adequacy of support, correctly classifying more than half of the caregiver sample. Results suggest that caregiver need does not necessarily elicit support. Needs do, however, predict several patterns of social support, the most common of which is characterized by stability (high or low support). Depending on type of support (instrumental or perceived adequacy), different configurations of predictors emerge.\r"

This study used data for respondents to the Retirement History Survey and found that estimated retirement equations for married Black men and single White women are significantly different from the retirement equation estimated for married White men. Blacks and single White women have substantially lower retirement wealth than married White men, and their Social Security wealth makes up a larger portion of their total wealth. As a consequence, their retirement responses to the changes in the Social Security system are also likely to differ from those of married White men. We found that, relative to married White men, the wealth and substitution responses to the increase in the normal retirement age for Social Security benefit acceptance are larger for single White men, single Black men, and single White women. The results suggest that estimates of the retirement responses of married men to changes in Social Security or pensions are not necessarily representative of the retirement responses of the population as a whole.\r"

We found that, in contrast to Western countries, a majority of the elderly population lived in extended family households. This was more likely in the Dominican Republic than in Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, or Peru, which was, in turn, more likely than in Mexico. However, such differences were most apparent among the married, not the unmarried. In all countries, unmarried people were more likely to live in extended family households than were married people. Among unmarried elderly, the likelihood was greater for women than for men. Contrary to initial expectations, neither urban/rural residence nor age among the elderly themselves tended to be important.\r"

Nonetheless, even when they experience significant declines in health, most single elderly persons who were living alone at the initial interview continued to live alone two years later. Multivariate analyses show that women who suffer declines in functional capacity are somewhat less likely than men who experience declines to live alone at Time two. In contrast, Blacks who suffer declines are more likely than Whites who experience declines to continue living alone at follow-up.\r"

The specific activity of choline acetyltransferase was also measured to provide an index of presynaptic cholinergic dysfunction. Our results revealed reciprocal changes in these activities that were of similar magnitude across the three regions examined. Furthermore, cytochrome C reductase activity was positively correlated with the density of neurofibrillary tangles, especially in the superior temporal cortex. These results support the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease may be associated with an alteration of endoplasmic reticulum and the functions related to this intracellular membrane system, including the post-translational modification and localization of essential proteins.\r"

Two days before killing the rats, both L-5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were injected with 100 microcuries [3H]glucosamine. Gangliosides were purified separately from sciatic nerve (SN) distal to the crush site, lumbosacral trunk (LST) proximal to the crush site, and the injected DRG. Changes in major glycoconjugate classes were previously reported; in this study total gangliosides were separated by high performance thin layer chromatography, located by autofluorography and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillography. In control DRG, major radiolabelled gangliosides were GM3 and LM1; in control LST and SN, GD1b and GT1b were the major ones. During day two and four following crush, GM3 and LM1 decreased in DRG, but at one and two weeks were at normal and elevated levels, respectively; there were inverse changes in GD3, GT1b and GQ1b. GD1b, GT1b and GQ1b were lower in crushed than in control LST and SN between days zero and four. In LST, GM3 and LM1 remained constant for four days, but were elevated at one and two weeks, whereas GD1a was elevated at all times. Indeed, GD1a is the major recently synthesized ganglioside that is transported into LST and SN two to four days after trauma, suggesting that it may play an important role in regeneration. Indices of oligosaccharide complexity and degree of sialylation indicated that between two and four days following crush, gangliosides in DRG had more complex oligosaccharides and more sialic acid residues than in either controls or in DRG of crushed nerves at one and two weeks post-crush. The degrees of ganglioside sialylation and oligosaccharide complexity in crushed LST and SN were lower than in control specimens between one and seven days after crush. Changes in the ganglioside composition of peripheral nerve following trauma may be important for axonal regeneration.\r"
