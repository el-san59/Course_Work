For interpretation of clinical findings, extensive pharmacokinetic studies were performed on patients. These showed that 99mTc-MAG3, compared with OIH, has a higher plasma-protein binding, an essentially higher intravascular concentration, a smaller volume of distribution and, with practically identical biologic half-lives, a correspondingly lower clearance. Simultaneous steady-state measurements resulted in a 1.5-fold higher clearance of OIH than of 99mTc-MAG3 (n = 124). Competitive inhibition of the tubular transport system by p-aminohippurate (PAH) (20 patients) revealed a distinctly higher suppression of the 99mTc-MAG3 clearance than of OIH which indicates a lower affinity of the 99mTc complex to the tubular cell. The plasma extraction efficiencies of both agents, measured during surgery (n = 5), did not indicate an extrarenal elimination of 99mTc-MAG3. This new radiopharmaceutical is a pragmatic alternative to OIH and offers advantages not only for scintigraphic imaging but is also suited for quantitative renal function studies.\r"

To evaluate the effect of region of interest (ROI) on the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), the results of the transfer function analysis (TFA) technique using precise ROI, TFA using rectangular ROI, and the routine method were compared. Regression analyses among RVEFs obtained from the above ROI methods yielded good correlations. Reliable RVEFs have been obtained even in the case of an improper bolus injection. Thus, the TFA technique is a new, simple, and reliable method for calculating RVEF without needing to outline the right ventricle precisely.\r"

The sensitivity of the first harmonic phase image for the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm was 80%. The clear phase shift (greater than 110 degrees) between the normal and the aneurysmal areas was missing in six patients. Peak acceleration images (negative maximum of the second derivative of the Fourier series) were calculated for each pixel with the analytical Fourier formula using two or three harmonics. A clear phase shift (greater than 126 degrees) than appeared in all the patients. This improvement was related to the increased weight of the second and third harmonics in the aneurysmal area when compared to control patients or to patients with dilative cardiomyopathy. Multiharmonic Fourier analysis clearly improved the sensitivity of the diagnosis of anterior left ventricular aneurysm on LAO 30 degrees-45 degrees gated blood-pool images.\r"

Absolute quantitation of tumor perfusion was achieved using external probes to estimate local extraction fraction. Redistribution of rubidium-81 (81Rb) was investigated using a dual-tracer technique. Average perfusion was found to be 13.5 and 3.7 ml/min/100 g in tumor and normal muscle, respectively. The extraction fraction as estimated from a two-compartment model ranged from 0.94 to 1.00. No significant redistribution of 81Rb was observed in these tissues. Nine patients with malignancies were studied using 81Rb and PET. Tumor perfusion in four patients with carcinoma of the breast was elevated by a factor of 1.8 (range 1.2-2.3) compared to contralateral normal breast.\r"

Large lesions with minimal tumor bone formation responded poorly, while primary lesions with substantial ossification usually exhibited a transient response. Small lesions with minimal lysis, metastatic lesions, and axial skeleton lesions generally responded well. The major adverse side effects of treatment were platelet and white blood cell count depression below baseline values for up to 4 wk (p less than 0.05). Minor depression of packed cell volume and transient elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase were also noted (p less than 0.05).

Total synthesis time is 45 min from end-of-bombardment. Carbon-11-meta-hydroxyephedrine is produced in 40%-50% corrected radiochemical yield with a specific activity of 900 Ci/mmol. Routine radiochemical and chemical purity are 95% and 98%, respectively. Biodistribution studies in rats show high myocardial uptake. Pretreatment with desipramine, a drug known to selectively block neuronal uptake, results in a 92% decrease in tracer accumulation in the myocardium. Metabolic studies in guinea pigs show less than 5% metabolites in heart tissue 30 min after intravenous injection suggesting that [11C]meta-hydroxyephedrine is suitable for kinetic modeling. These preliminary results support this new tracer as a clinical agent for neuronal imaging of the heart.\r"

Regional myocardial blood flow was forced to vary in the range 0.2-5 ml/min/g and actual values were assessed by in vitro counting of 153Gd microspheres. The ammonia input function was processed by: (a) total curve integration; (b) curve integration for 2 min; (c) integral of a fitted curve (gamma variate in vivo and exponential of the downslope in vitro). Method C brought to regional flow values which best approximated microspheres data. The in vitro correlation allows for correcting in vivo values for the flow-dependent extraction fraction. The method can be easily applied for regional myocardial blood flow measurements with PET in human studies.\r"

Six dogs were injected intravenously with FMR following 30-min occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Six sham animals served as control group. Regional myocardial blood flow as determined by microspheres decreased 87% during ischemia (p less than 0.01), but was not significantly different from control myocardium following reperfusion. Regional myocardial 18F activity as determined postmortem was significantly reduced in reperfused myocardium (-34%), which paralleled an 18% reduction of tissue norepinephrine concentration. Thus, short time periods of coronary occlusion affect neuronal function indicating the sensitivity of the sympathetic nerve terminals to ischemia. FMR provides a new tracer approach for the characterization of neuronal integrity in postischemic myocardium.\r"

The distribution of radiolabeled Microlite has been quantitated in mouse liver at the millimeter (multicellular) and the micrometer (cellular) levels. Measurements of radioactivity in 1-mm3 tissue samples indicate homogeneous radionuclide distribution; those derived from autoradiographs of 0.5-micron tissue sections show that, relative to other cells, the colloid was concentrated 200- to 1000-fold in liver macrophages. The dosimetric implications of such inhomogeneous radionuclide distribution in human liver, where similar radionuclide distribution is expected, are discussed on the basis of a recently developed model for calculating the dose at the cellular level, and the estimates are compared to conventional internal dosimetry predictions. It is demonstrated that during routine diagnostic examinations with 99mTc-Microlite, conventional dosimetry underestimates the dose to labeled human liver cells by factors of 8-30.\r"

The activity in monkey brain at 5 min was 2.8% ID and it cleared with a t1/2 of 86 min. Autoradiographs of monkey brain sections showed excellent regional detail with a gray/white ratio of 3.6 at 10 min.

Hepatic activities of both 111In-MAb 19-24 and 111In-MAb P3 were low. The lungs with tumor colonies demonstrated clearest images on Day 3. The specific binding of 111In-SCN-Bz-DTPA-labeled MAb 19-24 to pulmonary xenografts without appreciable liver uptake indicates that it may be useful in the clinical localization of pulmonic metastatic lesions.\r"

We have previously demonstrated that it is possible to selectively deliver radiation to the marrow space. In that study an initial short half-life of the radionuclide was observed. In this study we attempted to prolong the retention of the radioiodine in marrow through the use of propylthiouracil (PTU). When administered to normal dogs, PTU pretreatment resulted in improved marrow localization of 131I-labeled DM-5. There was no appreciable loss of activity from the marrow during the 2-4 hr postinjection time interval; a finding in contrast to the control animals where marrow activity declined a mean 45 +/- 0.5% over the same time period. Additionally, in contrast to controls, a rise in plasma trichloroacetic acid (TCA) nonprecipitable activity was not demonstrated in the PTU treated group during this 2-4 hr period. These results suggest that PTU's inhibition of deiodinases resulted in longer residence time of the radionuclide in its target tissue without adversely affecting distribution to non-target organs.\r"

A pulmonary arteriogram revealed no evidence of embolic disease; however, there was reduced capillary phase opacification of the right lung and increased pulmonary artery pressure. The findings are consistent with an isolated right pulmonary artery hypertension secondary to prolonged atelectasis causing an apparent mismatch on the ventilation-perfusion scan.\r"

Using a ratio greater than 1.0 to indicate redistribution and reversible ischemia, pre- and postoperative studies were compared for 20 patients. Regional polar plots based on 30 degrees angular sectors showed improvement greater than 2 standard deviations (s.d.s) ipsilateral to surgery in 15/19 (79%) and contralateral to the side of surgery in 8/19 (42%) patients with significant hemodynamic lesions. Using a hemispheric perfusion index (mean of four 30 degrees sectors) ipsilateral perfusion improved in 11/19 (58%) with bilateral improvement in 6/19 (32%). Visual interpretation was similar to the regional analysis with 14/19 (74%) improving on the operative side; however, it was less sensitive for contralateral changes, 4/19 (21%). We conclude that quantitation of redistribution can provide an objective index of improved perfusion and is especially important to detect contralateral changes.\r"

Image contrast and noise characteristics were analyzed for depth-weighted maximum activity projection, a form of volume rendering proposed by the authors for \"hot spot\" imaging in nuclear medicine. Contrast in the rendered images was nearly equal to that in slice display, and substantially improved compared to planar images. Image noise was reduced compared to both projection and slice display. Rendered images may be generated automatically in only a few minutes following filtered backprojection, permitting routine clinical use.\r"

For the avian and murine C-type retroviruses, the dinucleotide sequences reside two deoxynucleotides (usually AA and TT) from the LTR ends of unintegrated viral DNA (5' AATG...//...CATT3'). The number and identity of terminal deoxynucleotides in unintegrated HIV-1 linear DNA that extend beyond the conserved dinucleotides have not been determined. However, they had been presumed to consist of a single nucleotide (5'CTG...//...CAG3') on each end, based on inspection of the nucleotide sequence between the end of the supposed primer sites for retroviral DNA synthesis and the conserved proviral termini. We have utilized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify segments representing the joined ends of linear DNA present in covalently closed circular HIV-1 DNA molecules isolated from infected T cells. These fragments were cloned and the nucleotide sequence of the LTR-LTR circle junction of several independent clones determined. Based upon the results, we predict that, like the avian and murine viruses, HIV-1 linear DNA contains two nucleotides beyond the conserved dinucleotides: 5'ACTG...//...CAGT3'. Models for the origin of these termini and other observed junction sequences are proposed.\r"

We found significant associations between lower trytophan concentrations and neurologic/psychiatric symptoms. The negative correlation of tryptophan with kynurenine and neopterin concentrations indicates activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in patients. IDO can be induced by cytokines such as interferon-gamma and therefore low tryptophan levels may result from chronic immune stimulation in HIV-1 seropositives.\r"

Ninety-nine patients received zidovudine, of whom 75% were males, 92% were minorities, and 59% had a history of intravenous drug use. Of the 99 patients, 72 had AIDS and 27 had ARC with T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes less than or equal to 500 mm3. Eighty-seven of the 99 patients (88%) were compliant with zidovudine therapy. Fifty-seven percent of these had at least one adverse drug reaction requiring dose reduction (44%) or cessation (13%). Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other populations with HIV-related illness, although headache and nausea were less common. Twenty opportunistic infections (OIs) or HIV-related malignancies occurred in 15 of 82 (18%) patients who were on zidovudine for at least 4 weeks (7.6 OIs/1,000 patient weeks). Seven of the 82 died (9%), compared to 9 of the 17 patients (53%) who did not complete 4 weeks of zidovudine therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of these measures when intravenous drug users were compared with other risk groups. We conclude that zidovudine can be administered to intravenous drug users and others in an inner city clinic with acceptable compliance and tolerance.\r"

Patients received a Pap smear, cervicovaginal lavage for HPV determination by Southern blot, HIV serum antibody by enzyme immunoassay with Western blot confirmation, and thorough screening for other sexually transmitted diseases. Seventeen of the 35 (49%) women seropositive for HIV had HPV infection, compared with 8 of 32 (25%) seronegative women (p less than 0.05). Fourteen of 35 (40%) HIV-positive women had squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) on cervical cytology, compared with three of 32 (9%) HIV-negative women (p less than 0.01). Of 22 women with symptomatic HIV infection, 11 (50%) had SIL on cytology; 10 of these 11 were HPV-positive. Among 13 asymptomatic HIV-positive women, only three (23%) had such cytological lesions. Our findings strongly suggest that HIV-induced immunosuppression exacerbates HPV-mediated cervical cytologic abnormalities.\r"

This study compares the medical care costs of people with AIDS (PWAs) who received AZT with those of PWAs not receiving it. Seven of the nine PWAs who were on the AZT arm of the phase II drug trial of AZT at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) in 1986 and a matched sample of PWAs at SFGH who were eligible for the trial but did not participate in it were included in the study and followed for 12 months. It was found that costs in the first 12 months and especially in the first 6 months were lower for persons using AZT, primarily because of significantly lower use of hospital services. However, costs began to rise in the second 6 months for those using AZT. The authors therefore doubt that the lifetime costs of PWAs are lowered by the use of AZT and conclude that they are likely to be the same as those of PWAs not using the drug. If this is indeed the case, the use of the drug is likely to be relatively cost-effective.\r"

Of the HIV cases, 85% were working in just two cities whose prostitute populations comprised 50% of the total sample. The average incidence rate for the same two cities after 1 year was 2.3/1,000. HIV antibody-positive women were enrolled in a case-control study to determine demographic and epidemiologic risk factors. This study involving 34 HIV-positive prostitutes and 61 randomly selected negative control prostitutes did not reveal any risk factors related to sexual or other types of behavior. A history of genital warts, a history of abnormal vaginal discharge, and cytomegalovirus antibody were significantly more frequent in the HIV-positive cases than in the controls; however, by logistic regression analysis, only an abnormal vaginal discharge was independently associated with HIV infection. Absence of any evidence of transmission by blood transfusion or i.v. drug abuse suggests that HIV was introduced by the heterosexual route.\r"

In this study, a possible role of intrathecally (i.t.) administered CRF in modulating nociception and the involvement of opioid receptors were examined. CRF (i.t.) produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the mouse abdominal stretching (writhing) assay, with an ED50 of 22.1 (18.9-25.8) pmol/mouse. This antinociceptive effect of CRF peaked from 10 min to 1 hr after i.t. administration, although a significant antinociceptive effect was still observable 4 hr after injection. The dose-response curve of CRF antinociception was shifted to the right by i.t. administered alpha-helical CRF (9-41), a CRF antagonist, and the ED50 was raised by 3.7-fold. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, also dose-dependently shifted the antinociceptive dose-response curve of CRF to the right. Naloxone at 1 and 10 mg/kg s.c. increased the ED50 value of CRF by 2- and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, s.c. injection of 10 mg/kg of (+)-naltrexone, an inactive enantiomer of naltrexone, did not affect significantly the antinociception of i.t. administered CRF. Intrathecal injection of nor-binaltorphimine, a highly selective kappa opioid antagonist, increased the antinociceptive ED50 of CRF by 5.6-fold. However, the antinociceptive activity of CRF (i.t.) was not significantly affected by either beta-funaltrexamine, an irreversible mu selective opioid antagonist, or naltrindole, a highly selective delta opioid antagonist. Furthermore, the antinociceptive ED50 of CRF was not altered by (+)-1-nor-binaltorphimine, an inactive enantiomer of nor-binaltorphimine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

U-66444B depressed DA neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area with a potency three times that for apomorphine. With a sufficient dose, cells were completely silenced. Activity was found to reside principally in the (+)-stereoisomer, U-68553B. The effects of U-66444B and U-68553B were reversed by 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol. Apomorphine, but not U-66444B nor U-68553B, depressions were accompanied by rapid tachyphylaxis. After 2 wk of U-66444B 0.6 mg/kg/day, potency was not significantly affected. By using in vivo voltammetry, 100 micrograms/kg U-68553B produced a depression in DA release that was more dramatic and more prolonged than that for 500 micrograms/kg apomorphine. On DA postsynaptic receptors, iontophoretic U-66444B and apomorphine were approximately equipotent in depressing caudate neuron firing. It is concluded that U-66444B and its active enantiomer, U-68553B, are more potent, longer acting and possibly more selective as DA autoreceptor agonists than apomorphine. The propensity to produce tolerance appears weak.\r"

In the present study, we have tested the effects of fenoldopam, a dopamine DA1, receptor agonist with renal vasodilator properties, on the changes in renal function induced by acute and subacute administration of cyclosporine A. In inactin-anesthetized rats, acute administration of cyclosporine A (100 mg/kg i.p.) significantly decreased paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) and inulin clearances. Fenoldopam, at a dose (10 micrograms/kg.min) which alone significantly increased PAH and inulin clearances, completely prevented the cyclosporine A-induced reductions in renal function. Similarly, subacute administration of cyclosporine A (20 mg/kg.day for 3 days) resulted in significant reductions in base-line PAH and inulin clearances which were normalized by administration of fenoldopam. These data indicate that administration of fenoldopam can both prevent and completely reverse cyclosporine A-induced renal vasoconstriction and nephrotoxicity.\r"

At 15 min after administration of SAM, the UDPGA level in the liver was markedly decreased. Although the total biliary excretion of bilirubin showed no change, the bilirubin diglucuronide level in the 0- to 30-min period after SAM administration was significantly lower (36.9 +/- 4.3%) than that of the untreated control group during the same period (47.5 +/- 1.7%; P less than .01). The biliary bilirubin monoglucuronide (BMG) level in the 0- to 30-min period was significantly increased, compared with the control group. The C8-BMG/C12-BMG ratio in the 0- to 30-min period was significantly higher than that of the control group. At 150 min after SAM administration, there was an increase in the UDPGA level in the liver accompanied by an increase in bilirubin diglucuronide and a decrease in BMG. These results indicate that changes in UDPGA in the liver due to SAM administration influence the bilirubin composition of the bile.\r"

  ".U": "90347705\r", 
  ".W": "Physiological data suggest that the direct effect of spinal opiates as well as the activation of adrenergic bulbospinal pathways each results in a reduction in the gain of the stimulus response function in dorsal horn neurons. In its simplest form, this suggests the hypothesis that co-activation of spinal alpha2 and opioid receptors should be manifested as a synergistic interaction in which in its simplest form the net effect would be a product of the effect produced by either drug alone. To assess this hypothesis, rats were prepared with chronically implanted intrathecal (IT) catheters. Dose-response curves for IT morphine were obtained in the presence of fixed doses (0.01 nmol, 0.03 nmol, 0.1 nmol, 0.3 nmol) of 2-[2,6-dimethylphenylamino]-2-imidazoline (ST-91), an alpha 2 agonist. Such concurrent administration of ST-91 resulted in highly significant leftward shifts in the effect of morphine on the hot plate (52.5 degrees C) measure with a significant increase in dose-response curve slopes. To minimize the effects of the cut-off time necessary in an antinociceptive measure, a \"Cox proportional hazard\" analysis was used. The (log) Hazard function log[h(t)] is expressed as a linear function of the effects resulting from the action of morphine, the action of ST-91 and as a function of an interaction of morphine and ST-91, e.g., the general form is: log[h(t)] = alpha o(t) + beta 1.log doseM + beta 2.log doseST + beta 12.log doseM.log doseST Estimates of the principal coefficients beta 1, beta 2 and beta 12 corresponding to the overall effect of morphine alone, ST-91 alone and the interaction between the two were calculated: beta 1, beta 2 and beta 12. A statistical test of the interaction coefficient revealed that beta 12 was significantly (p less than .001) different from zero, indicating the powerful synergy between IT ST-91 and morphine. Confirmation of the synergistic nature of spinal opioid alpha 2 receptors was provided by the fact that IT injection of naloxone (90 nmol) or phentolamine (100 nmol) after IT injection of various combinations of morphine and ST-91 immediately and completely abolished the potentiating effect of the combination. The clearance of IT [3H]morphine from the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord was not changed in the presence of ST-91. These observations suggest a potent synergistic interaction between spinal mu and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor systems.\r"

  ".W": "Caffeine (3-93 mg/kg iv.) did not alter systemic blood pressure, central venous or portal venous pressure or blood flow or vascular conductance in the hepatic artery (HA) or superior mesenteric artery (SMA) of cats anesthetized with pentobarbital or chloralose. Caffeine did not antagonize the physiological response (adenosine-mediated dilation) of the HA induced by reduced portal flow but did produce a noncompetitive antagonism of the vasodilation induced by exogenous adenosine. Pharmacodynamic data for the HA and SMA indicated that the maximum response calculated (Rmax) of adenosine was suppressed but the dose producing half Rmax was unaltered by caffeine. Although the Rmax for adenosine-induced dilation of the HA was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, the Rmax for caffeine's effect was only 60%, thus indicating that about 40% of the dilator effect of adenosine could not be suppressed at any dose of caffeine. The dilator response to isoproterenol was unaffected by caffeine. The observation that 40% of the dilator effect of adenosine was also not suppressible by caffeine suggests that adenosine causes dilation by two different mechanisms, one of which (perhaps cyclic AMP-dependent) is not affected by caffeine. To produce a 50% inhibition of the HA Rmax for adenosine, a dose of 33 mg/kg of caffeine was required (53 mg/kg in the SMA); doses of 93 mg/kg consistently produced cardiac arrhythmias. It is thus unlikely that even very heavy caffeine consumption would lead to altered hepatic blood flow or altered regulation of adenosine-mediated vascular responses.\r"

In particular, buspirone does not consistently produce large increases in rates of responding suppressed by punishment in rodents or primates. To study the effects of buspirone and other compounds on suppressed operant responding in rats, two procedures were used. In the first, food-reinforced responding was suppressed during a stimulus associated with response-produced electric shocks (punishment). Chlordiazepoxide produced large increases in rates of punished responding, but neither buspirone nor ipsapirone gave rise to a similar effect. In a second experiment, food-reinforced responding was suppressed during a stimulus that terminated with an unavoidable shock (conditioned emotional response). Chlorodiazepoxide and clorazepate increased suppressed response rates at low doses and decreased nonsuppressed responding at higher doses, giving rise to dose-related increases in suppression ratios. The effects of buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone were similar to those of the benzodiazepines with ipsapirone producing particularly marked increases in responding during the pre-shock stimulus. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin did not consistently give rise to the same effect. In addition, similar effects were not produced by haloperidol, imipramine, morphine or idazoxan. Haloperidol and morphine decreased nonsuppressed responding without changing rates of suppressed responding or suppression ratios. Imipramine decreased rates of both nonsuppressed and suppressed responding and idazoxan decreased suppression ratios. The conditioned emotional response procedure may be more sensitive for assessing the behavioral effects of buspirone and similar anxiolytic drugs in rats than are punishment procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study examined the hypothesis of whether there is a compensatory activation of SP biosynthesis in order to replenish the L-DOPA-induced SP depletion. Three-day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine and were challenged with L-DOPA at about 60 days of age. The animals were sacrificed 75 min, 6 hr or 24 hr after the L-DOPA administration. The levels of SP (in the striatum and substantia nigra) were determined by radioimmunoassay. The abundance of SP-encoding preprotachykinin (PPT) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the striatum was determined by Northern blot analysis and the abundance of individual PPT-mRNAs (alpha, beta and gamma) was determined by nuclease protection assays. Concentrations of dopamine and its acid metabolite, dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. At the 75 min time point, L-DOPA produced a greater decrease in SP levels in the striatum and the substantia nigra, than that observed with lesion alone. The SP levels recovered to lesioned-control levels by 6 hr and remained at this level at the 24-hr time point. This recovery was accompanied by a marked increase in striatal SP-encoding PPT-mRNA abundance at 6 hr; mRNA levels were below lesioned-control value at 24 hr. There were no differential changes in the individual SP-encoding PPT-mRNAs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Species variation in oxime protection against soman was examined in mice and guinea pigs with the bis-pyridinium oxime HI-6. HI-6, an effective reactivator of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase, produced greater maximal protection against soman in mice than in guinea pigs, although there was no species difference in acetylcholinesterase reactivation. In mice the maximal therapeutic dose of HI-6 increased the LD50 of soman from 113 micrograms/kg in unprotected animals to 992 micrograms/kg in animals receiving 76.6 mg/kg of HI-6 and 11.2 mg/kg of atropine. In guinea pigs the maximal therapeutic dose of HI-6 increased the LD50 of soman from 28.2 micrograms/kg in unprotected animals to 179 micrograms/kg in animals receiving 136 mg/kg of HI-6 and 16 mg/kg of atropine. In animals whose carboxylesterase had been inhibited with 2 mg/kg of cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide, the soman LD50 values in unprotected mice and guinea pigs were similar (10.2 vs. 12.2 micrograms/kg), as were the soman LD50 values in mice and guinea pigs protected with HI-6 and atropine (159 vs. 151 micrograms/kg). In cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide-treated mice and guinea pigs the achievement of equal HI-6 protection against soman correlated with the ability of HI-6 to produce equal levels of reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in both species. In animals whose carboxylesterase levels were different, the animals with higher carboxylesterase levels (i.e., mice) achieved higher levels of HI-6 protection against soman than did animals with lower levels of carboxylesterase (i.e, guinea pigs). This observation suggested that, in addition to its reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase, HI-6 produced an effect on carboxylesterase that increased its therapeutic effect in mice.\r"

There was no change, however, in the sensitivity of longitudinal smooth muscles to muscarinic agonists as reflected by the EC50 values for stimulation of muscle contraction. This increased responsiveness of the muscles was accompanied by a 32% reduction in the density of muscarinic receptors (381 +/- 93 vs. 560 +/- 74 fmol/mg of membrane protein) in muscles from STZ-diabetic rats. There was no change in agonist or antagonist binding affinities in muscles from diabetic rats, and there was no alteration in the distribution of receptors between the states characterized by high and low affinity agonist binding. There was also no change in acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle membranes isolated from STZ-diabetic rats. The origin of the increased responsiveness of ileal smooth muscles in this model of diabetes is not clear, but may involve changes in the muscarinic signal transduction pathway beyond the receptor level, or in the contractile apparatus itself.\r"

This agent (p.o.) is also highly protective against cisplatin-induced emesis in the dog, as well as cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin-induced emesis in the ferret. When administered either p.o. or i.v., RG 12915 has a lower ED50 value (0.004 mg/kg) than GR 38032F, BRL 43694 and metoclopramide for attenuating cisplatin-induced emetic episodes in the ferret. It also has a long duration of action against cisplatin-induced emesis in the ferret. In contrast to metoclopramide, RG 12915 lacks significant antidopaminergic activity both in vitro [( 3H]spiroperidol displacement), as well as in vivo (apomorphine-induced emesis). In radioligand binding assays, RG 12915 is a potent and selective displacer of binding of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 binding sites (IC50 value = 0.16 nM), whereas failing to displace binding of ligands for the alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta adrenergic, 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 or cholinergic-muscarinic sites with IC50 values less than 1 microM. At a p.o. dose (1 mg/kg) in which RG 12915 is highly protective against cisplatin-induced emesis in the dog, RG 12915 has no significant gastroprokinetic activity in the same species. In summary, RG 12915 is a potent and p.o. effective agent against cytotoxic drug-induced emesis in animal models. The antiemetic potency of RG 12915 against cisplatin is unrelated to antidopaminergic or gastroprokinetic activity, but may be related to its affinity for 5-HT3 binding sites.\r"

MDMA shares the dopamine-releasing properties of amphetamine but has been found to be a more potent releaser of serotonin (5-HT). The present study undertook to determine the relative roles of dopamine and 5-HT release in MDMA-induced locomotor hyperactivity. S-(+)MDMA produced dose-dependent increases of rat locomotion. Investigatory behaviors such as holepokes and rearings were suppressed by (+)MDMA. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluoxetine, sertraline and zimelidine inhibited (+)MDMA-induced locomotor hyperactivity but failed to antagonize the reduction of holepokes and rearings. Because 5-HT uptake inhibitors have been found previously to block the MDMA-induced release of 5-HT in vitro, and because fluoxetine was found to have no effect on (+)amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, the present results suggest that (+) MDMA-induced locomotor hyperactivity is dependent on release of endogenous 5-HT. Additionally, prior depletion of central 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine partially antagonized the (+)MDMA-induced hyperactivity, although catecholamine synthesis inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine did not block the effects of (+)MDMA. Taken together, these studies suggest that (+)MDMA increases locomotor activity via mechanisms that are dependent on the release of central 5-HT and that are qualitatively different from the mechanism of action of (+)amphetamine.\r"

Both carbachol (4 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and bethanechol (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) significantly elevated all these parameters at the doses that stimulated gastric acid secretion; the net HCO3- output caused by these agents was about 35% of that produced by prostaglandin E2 (300 micrograms/kg, i.v.). These responses induced by carbachol were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with verapamil (0.2 mg/kg, i.v.), a Ca channel blocker, and atropine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), a nonselective M1 and M2 antagonist, while they remained unaltered in the presence of pirenzepine (1 mg/kg, i.v.), a selective M1 antagonist, or indomethacin (5 mg/kg, s.c.). However, the effects of prostaglandin E2 on duodenal pH, potential difference and HCO3- output were not significantly affected by any of these agents. These results suggest that the cholinergic agents stimulate HCO3- output in the duodenum, probably mediated by M2 receptors and through the Ca-dependent and electrogenic processes. Endogenous prostaglandins may not be involved in this mechanism.\r"

In the present study, napamezole was evaluated in vivo for its ability to antagonize alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and to inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine re-uptake. The alpha-2 blocking activity of napamezole was demonstrated by its ability to: 1) antagonize clonidine-induced antinociception in mice (ED50 value, 36 mg/kg p.o.; 3 mg/kg s.c.); 2) enhance norepinephrine turnover in rat brain (minimum effective dose, 30 mg/kg p.o.); and 3) enhance locus coeruleus neuronal firing (active at doses greater than or equal to 1 mg kg i.v.) and to reverse clonidine-induced suppression of locus coeruleus firing in rats. The rank order of potencies of napamezole and reference alpha-2 antagonists to inhibit clonidine-induced antinociception (based upon s.c.

The ability of each of these compounds to enhance alpha-methyltyrosine-induced depletion of rat-forebrain norepinephrine was reversed by the administration of clonidine.

  ".W": "This study investigates the possibility that mianserin, a serotonin-2 (5HT2) receptor antagonist, produces a prolonged antagonism of quipazine discrimination, consistent with its prolonged biochemical effects. Rats were trained on a saline-quipazine (1.5 mg/kg) discrimination; following acquisition, the animals were assigned to groups and given injections of 2.0 mg/kg mianserin. Individual groups were tested at 45 min and successive 12-hr intervals for their ability to discriminate 0.75 mg/kg of quipazine, a dose that elicited 75% responding on the quipazine lever. Blockade of the quipazine cue persisted for 48 hr following mianserin administration. The above procedure was replicated using lower doses of mianserin (0.25, 0.10 and 0.05 mg/kg) and two other 5HT2 antagonists, pizotifen and metergoline (2.0 mg/kg), both of which showed similar profiles of extended antagonism. Changes in both receptor density and receptor sensitivity were investigated as possible mechanisms of mianserin's prolonged activity. Analysis of [3H]ketanserin binding revealed that a single 2.0-mg/kg dose of mianserin produced a significant decrease in the number of receptor sites (44%) 24 hr after treatment; however, this loss of sites recovered by 36 hr post-injection and could therefore not account for mianserin's continued antagonism at this and later times. 5HT-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cerebral cortex slices was used as a measure of 5HT2 receptor sensitivity. Treatment of rats with 2 mg/kg of mianserin caused a marked reduction in the maximum phosphoinositide response to 5HT that persisted for up to 36 hr. Hence, the time course for recovery of 5HT2 receptor sensitivity corresponded more closely to behavioral recovery than did 5HT2 receptor binding.\r"

In concentrations selective for dopamine receptors (10(-9)-10(-7) M), quinpirole did not influence cholinergic twitch responses induced by transmural stimulation at supramaximal voltage, but it concentration-dependently facilitated them in the concentration range 10(-6) to 10(-4) M; the potency of quinpirole was similar to that of metoclopramide (ED50 values, 6.0 x 10(-6) M and 2.2 x 10(-6) M, respectively). Pretreatment of the tissues with 5-hydroxytryptamine or with the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonists methysergide, ketanserin and R53434 did not influence the facilitatory effect of quinpirole. It was also not influenced by drugs blocking adrenoceptors, dopamine receptors, opioid receptors, muscarinic M1 receptors, GABAA receptors and inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. It was antagonized by the nicotinic receptor antagonist hexamethonium but not by pentolinium. Quinpirole did not enhance contractile responses to acetylcholine and carbachol, but in high concentrations induced contractions in unstimulated preparations. It is concluded that quinpirole facilitates twitch responses in the guinea pig ileum via a prejunctional site of action. This effect is not related to activation of dopamine receptors, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.\r"

ACh, oxotremorine or (-)-nicotine, all tested at 100 microM had no effect on the spontaneous outflow of [3H]GABA. The depolarization-evoked overflow obtained by exposing the synaptosomes to 9 mM KCl was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by ACh, oxotremorine, oxotremorine-M or carbachol. The maximal inhibition caused by ACh was 50%. The EC50 (agonist concentration causing half-maximal effect) amounted to 1 microM. Oxotremorine and oxotremorine-M were almost equipotent to ACh, whereas the concentration-response curve of carbachol was slightly (although not significantly) shifted to the right with respect to that of ACh. (-)-Nicotine (100 microM) did not affect the K(+)-evoked [3H]GABA overflow. ACh also inhibited the K(+)-evoked release of endogenous GABA. The inhibitory effect of 10 microM ACh on the release of [3H]GABA evoked by 9 mM KCl was insensitive to the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (10 microM) but it was potently blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine (IC50 = 5 nM) and weakly antagonized by pirenzepine, dicyclomine and AF-DX 116. The pharmacological profile of this receptor was very similar to that of the muscarinic autoreceptors regulating [3H]ACh release. The extent of [3H]GABA release inhibition caused by ACh did not differ between dorsal and ventral striatum. The inhibitory effect of ACh was much less pronounced in hippocampus and cortex than in the striatum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Total drug, AM and desethylamiodarone (DEA) were determined in plasma, eight tissues and excreta of rats with constant body weight. Three exponential terms were sufficient to describe the plasma concentration-time curve of unchanged AM with a long terminal half-life of 131 hr. An equally long terminal half-life of AM could also be observed in all tissues investigated. After 5 min, 42% of the radioactivity appeared in the liver, where it underwent redistribution to muscle, skin and, ultimately, adipose tissues. Whereas plasma and liver contained mainly unidentified metabolites and little DEA, unchanged AM predominated in all other tissues. According to the time-integrated parameters of distribution, AM has a potential to accumulate in adipose tissue under chronic administration. In contrast, DEA accumulation would be likely to occur in lean tissues, mainly in the lung. In 10 days, 94% of the injected radioactivity was excreted in feces and less than 2% in urine. Almost all of the excreted radioactivity consisted of unidentified metabolites, indicating that both AM and DEA are eliminated by metabolism.\r"

AlF and NaF produced large increases in stress (force/muscle cross-sectional area), but temporal changes were dissimilar, as were other indices of muscle activation. Stress produced by NaF developed slowly and only after a long delay of about 15 min, whereas stress produced by AlF developed rapidly after a delay of only about 5 min. NaF-induced contractions were more sustained than AlF-induced contractions. Both AlF and NaF increased the level of cross-bridge phosphorylation and the velocity of muscle shortening, but at comparable stresses, AlF produced greater increases than did NaF. AlF produced a large increase in lP production, whereas NaF produced a small increase. Also, AlF-induced stress was largely insensitive to inhibition by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine (1 microM), whereas NaF-induced stress was largely inhibited by nifedipine. However, in tissues depleted of calcium, both agents produced potent contractions when CaCl2 was added back to the tissues (EC50 values for AlF, NaF, histamine, phenylephrine and KCl were, respectively, 0.057, 0.085, 0.11, 0.11 and 0.23 mM). AlF, but not NaF, strongly desensitized arteries to phenylephrine, causing a 73% reduction in the ability of phenylephrine to achieve maximum steady-state stress. These data suggest that fluoride contracted rabbit femoral arteries by stimulating L-type calcium channels, and that aluminum fluoride stimulated phospholipase C, producing additional muscle activation.\r"

Metabolite formation was monitored after short-term incubations using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to determine concentrations of the catecholamine. The formation of N-methyl-alpha-methyldopamine exhibited enantioselectivity and levels were significantly higher after incubation of the (+)-isomer. The reaction appears to be cytochrome P-450 dependent as it was sensitive to SKF 525A and carbon monoxide. The catecholamine was unstable and was metabolized rapidly to a compound capable of forming an adduct with glutathione (GSH) and other thiol compounds. This second oxidation did not appear to be cytochrome P-450-dependent but required NADPH and microsomal protein. Catecholamine oxidation was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and by reducing agents. The same catecholamine oxidation product, characterized as the GSH adduct, could be generated by a xanthine-xanthine oxidase mixture and by tyrosinase. Mass spectral data showed that it was a 1:1 amine GSH adduct. These results indicate that MDMA is oxidized by cytochrome P-450 to the catechol and the catecholamine oxidized by superoxide to a quinone to which GSH or other thiol functions add. The formation of this quinone and its thiol adducts may account for some of the irreversible actions of this compound on serotonergic neurons.\r"

  ".U": "90347727\r", 
  ".W": "Because of uncertainty concerning the interaction of ethanol with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated events, the present work was designed to investigate the effect of ethanol on GABA transmission in the rat septal area using behavioral and electrophysiological techniques. Microinjection of the GABAA agonist muscimol into the medial septal area (MSA) enhanced, and bicuculline administration antagonized, ethanol-induced impairment of the aerial righting reflex. Microinjection of these drugs into the lateral septum (LSi) did not influence this measure of ethanol-induced sedation. Furthermore, intraseptal injections of muscimol or bicuculline in saline-treated rats had no effect on the aerial righting reflex. These data suggest that the MSA plays a critical modulatory role in the sedative actions of ethanol. To assess the effect of ethanol on muscimol responses in the MSA and LSi at the cellular level, GABA was applied by iontophoresis to rhythmically bursting neurons of the MSA and to cells in the LSi. The magnitude of the resultant inhibition by GABA on these cells was assessed before and after systemic administration of ethanol. Ethanol enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition of MSA neural activity, but did not alter GABA-mediated inhibition of cellular activity in the LSi. In contrast, the inhibition of cellular activity in the MSA, caused by a maximally effective concentration of the benzodiazepine flurazepam, was not altered by ethanol. Other work in the MSA demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the fimbria caused an inhibition of ongoing single unit activity that was reduced by concurrent application of bicuculline. The duration of this electrically elicited inhibition in the MSA was enhanced after ethanol injection and then recovered to base-line levels. In addition, ethanol (1.5 mg/kg) caused an enhancement of the inhibition induced by nipecotic acid, a GABA uptake inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition is enhanced by ethanol in the MSA but not the LSi, indicating that the actions of ethanol on GABA-induced inhibition can be site specific. It is proposed that the cellular action of ethanol may depend upon a specific molecular composition of the GABA receptor complex which may vary at selected sites in the brain.\r"

The Kd value for the block of the T-type Ca channel was 233 microM and the Hill coefficient was 1.1. The drug showed a rapid onset of action and a quick wash out with complete reversibility. Amiloride blocked the T-type Ca channel without frequency-dependency, i.e., block was established at the holding potential (-90 mV) without being dependent on activation and inactivation of the channel. Amiloride reduced the amplitude of the T-type Ca current at all potentials without changing steady-state activation and inactivation. Amiloride did not affect the T-type Ca current when the drug was applied intracellularly via the pipette solution. In summary, amiloride blocked the T-type Ca channel in a channel state- and voltage-independent way.\r"

(2) Acid-loaded cells (pHi 6.43 +/- 0.01 in cells) recovered towards neutrality via activation of Na+/H+ exchange (rate 0.47 pH U/min), and halothane inhibited the rate of pHi recovery by 50%. The halothane-mediated inhibition of alkalinizations after hypertonic exposure or acid-loading was also observed in bis-(o-amino-phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetate-loaded cells in Ca2(+)-free medium. Therefore, halothane increases [Ca2+]i and in parallel inhibits Na+/H+ exchange, compromising the ability of muscle cells to recover from imposed acidification.\r"

  ".W": "The potassium currents in rat and guinea pig ventricular myocytes and mouse astrocytes were studied using tedisamil, a novel antiarrhythmic agent. A 1 to 20 microM dosage of tedisamil caused marked prolongation of the action potential in isolated rat ventricular myocytes, mimicking its reported effects on multicellular rat heart preparations. Under voltage clamp conditions, tedisamil caused a dose-dependent increase in the speed of inactivation of the transient outward K+ current (Ito), the predominant outward current in rat ventricular myocytes. In cardiac myocytes, the tedisamil block was neither use- nor voltage-dependent. The slow reversibility of drug action when applied from the outside, and its effectiveness when applied intracellularly, suggested an internal site of drug action. In guinea pig ventricular myocytes, tedisamil blocked the slowly developing time-dependent delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) over the same concentration range as that found for Ito in the rat myocytes. Tedisamil reduced this current without changing the characteristics of its slow (tau approximately 1 sec) activation. The effects of tedisamil on Ito and IK were independent of the phosphorylation state of the channel, as assessed by the equal effectiveness of the drug in the presence or absence of isoproterenol. Tedisamil also blocked the transient K+ current and the delayed rectifier current (IK) in mouse astrocytes over the same concentration range as that found in the cardiac myocytes and by a process that accelerated (transient K+ current) or mimicked (IK) inactivation. At concentrations of up to 50 microM, tedisamil had little effect on the time-dependent inward rectifier K+ current, or inward calcium current in rat or guinea pig ventricular myocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is orally effective for the treatment of chronic lead intoxication in humans. Earlier studies have shown that the majority of DMSA, given p.o. to normal humans, is excreted in the urine as mixed disulfides with L-cysteine. We have developed an assay for the determination of DMSA that has made possible the determination of the form of DMSA in blood and plasma. After p.o. administration of 10 mg DMSA/kg to four normal young men, no unaltered DMSA (unaltered DMSA is the unbound, parent compound; total DMSA consists of unaltered DMSA plus oxidized (disulfide) DMSA and is determined after reduction with dithiothreitol) was found in the blood over an 8-hr period. Only after treatment of blood or plasma with the disulfide-reducing agent, dithiothreitol, was DMSA detected. This indicates that DMSA is in disulfide linkage with plasma proteins and/or non-protein sulfhydryl compounds. Most of the DMSA in the plasma (92-95%) was found to be bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. The remaining DMSA may be bound to small molecular weight (less than 10,000 MW) nonprotein sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine. Plasma protein appears to serve as a depot and reservoir of DMSA, which can exchange for cysteine. The urinary excretion of unaltered DMSA and DMSA mixed disulfides with L-cysteine suggests that this exchange takes place at the kidney.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The structural similarities between beta-alkyl GBLs and the convulsant picrotoxinin suggested that alkyl substituted GBLs and TBLs act at the picrotoxin receptor. To test this hypothesis we examined the interactions of convulsant and anticonvulsant GBLs and TBLs with the picrotoxin, benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding sites of the GABA receptor complex. All of these convulsants and anticonvulsants studied competitively displaced 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS), a ligand that binds to the picrotoxin receptor. This inhibition of 35S-TBPS binding was not blocked by the GABA antagonist bicuculline methobromide. The convulsant GBLs and TBLs also partially inhibited [3H]muscimol binding to the GABA site and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site, but they did so at concentrations substantially greater than those that inhibited 35S-TBPS binding. The anticonvulsant GBLs and TBLs had no effect on either [3H]muscimol or [3H]flunitrazepam binding. In contrast to the GBLs and TBLs, pentobarbital inhibited TBPS binding in a manner that was blocked by bicuculline methobromide, and it enhanced both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding. Both ethosuximide and tetramethylsuccinimide, neuroactive compounds structurally similar to GBLs, competitively displaced 35S-TBPS from the picrotoxin receptor and both compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H] muscimol binding. In addition, ethosuximide also partially diminished [3H]flunitrazepam binding. These data demonstrate that the site of action of alkyl-substituted GBLs and TBLs is different from that of GABA, barbiturates and benzodiazepines. We suggest that the GBLs and TBLs act at the picrotoxin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Benzoyltropine and tropacocaine are two contaminants of street-cocaine reported to have parasympatholytic activity. Because the mechanism underlying this activity is obscure, we investigated the effects of these compounds on several cholinergic processes: sodium-dependent choline uptake, sodium-independent choline uptake, acetylcholine synthesis, acetylcholine release (spontaneous and veratridine-induced) and binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate to muscarinic receptors. These studies used rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes, except for the receptor-binding studies, which used whole brain plasma membranes. Benzoyltropine and tropacocaine each inhibited sodium-dependent choline uptake and acetylcholine synthesis in a dose-related manner that was competitive with extracellular choline. Benzoyltropine was 4 to 5 times more potent in both actions than tropacocaine. Sodium-independent choline uptake was not affected by either compound. Benzoyltropine (30 microM) had no effect on the sodium-dependent uptake of norepinephrine, gamma-amino-butyric acid, glutamate or serotonin; tropacocaine (30 microM) inhibited only norepinephrine uptake at this concentration. Benzoyltropine and tropacocaine each inhibited the spontaneous and veratridine-induced release of newly synthesized acetylcholine, but not via activation of presynaptic muscarinic receptors. Instead, each compound was able to attenuate the oxotremorine-induced inhibition of the release of acetylcholine, suggesting antimuscarinic activity. Binding experiments showed that benzoyltropine and tropacocaine were, respectively, about 1,000- and 10,000-fold less potent than scopolamine as receptor antagonists. Finally, we demonstrated that benzoyltropine accumulates in the rat brain after its peripheral injection (10 mg/kg i.p.) and remains there with a half-life similar to that of cocaine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have used two different selective inhibitors of Ca2(+)-calmodulin-dependent enzymes such as a calmodulin antagonist, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene-sulfonamide (W-7), and a newly synthesized selective inhibitor of CaM kinase II, 1-[N,O-bis(1,5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-L-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpipe raz ine (KN-62). N-[1-[P-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)benzyl]-2-(4- phenylpiperazinyl)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (KN-04), a derivative of KN-62, which has a much lower inhibitory activity on the enzyme, was also synthesized for use as a control. Although i.v. injection of the drugs did not produce any effect, infusion of W-7 or KN-62 into the 4th ventricle produce any effect, infusion of W-7 or KN-62 into the 4th ventricle of the rat caused hypertension and tachycardia, associated with the diminished rate of GABA release in cerebrospinal fluid. The ability of KN-62 to produce these effects was more potent than that of W-7. Intracisternal infusion of KN-04 influenced neither systemic blood pressure nor GABA release at the concentration up to 100 microM. The same order of potencies of three agents (KN-62 greater than W-7 much greater than KN-04) has been obtained in their effects on either in vitro CaM kinase II activity, the in vivo autonomic nervous system or the rate of GABA release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We assessed the kinetics and magnitude of interaction of MND with the sodium channel in canine ventricular tissue superfused in vitro using Vmax as an index of sodium channel block. At a basic cycle length of 1000 msec, MND (4-32 micrograms/ml) produced a concentration-dependent depression of both Vmax and amplitude of the action potential and accelerated all phases of repolarization in Purkinje fibers. To assess rate-dependent block, Purkinje fibers were stimulated with pulse trains at interstimulus intervals of 400 to 2000 msec. MND produced a concentration- and rate-dependent increase in the magnitude of rate-dependent block. There was also a concentration-dependent increase in the kinetics of onset of block (decrease in rate constant). The rate constant increased with faster stimulation rates. Minimal tonic block occurred at clinically relevant concentrations. Recovery from rate-dependent block followed a single exponential time course with time constants of 5.23 +/- 0.90 and 4.88 +/- 0.94 sec for Vmax and activation time, respectively. There was no shift of the normalized Vmax-membrane potential relationship except at the highest concentration, 32 micrograms/ml. At cycle lengths of 250 to 1000 msec, MND (4 micrograms/ml) shortened all phases of repolarization in Purkinje fibers, the greatest shortening occurring at the longest cycle length. Prolongation of effective refractory period occurred only at rapid heart rates. Both action potential duration and effective refractory period were prolonged in ventricular muscle which was independent of rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Metabolites produced by the flora could be the source of adverse reactions reported only with the p.o. controlled release formulations but not with immediate release formulations. Verapamil was found to be metabolized to thiocyanate, nor-verapamil and several more polar metabolites that were detected by either a specific assay for cyanide and thiocyanate or a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, respectively. The rate of thiocyanate formation with an initial substrate concentration of 2 mM verapamil was found to be 0.008 +/- 0.004 microgram/hr/ml of 1:10 cecal suspension. The N-demethylated metabolite, nor-verapamil, was detected in the cecal suspensions but it also disappeared with time. The rate of verapamil disappearance was dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the incubation mixture; the rate being most rapid with the highest concentration of bacteria. Acetonitrile and butyronitrile were also found to be metabolized by the cecal flora. Cyanide as well as thiocyanate were produced from both organo-nitriles. These results suggest that the cyano group of verapamil, acetonitrile and butyronitrile were all cleaved to form cyanide and/or thiocyanate. With verapamil, cleavage of the cyano group would form new chemical entities that could be pharmacologically active and serve as a source of some of the adverse reactions or side-effects reported.\r"

Morphine and naltrexone occasioned responding on the respective correct keys in a dose-related manner with complete generalization (greater than or equal to 90% correct) occurring with doses of morphine larger than 10.0 mg/kg and doses of naltrexone larger than 0.001 mg/kg. Several opioid mu and kappa agonists were studied in dependent pigeons and in morphine-abstinent pigeons (i.e., 30-hr morphine-deprived). The opioid mu agonist etonitazene substituted completely for morphine in dependent pigeons; in abstinent pigeons a small dose of etonitazine reversed withdrawal and larger doses substituted for morphine. Some opioid agonists did not substitute completely for morphine in dependent pigeons and partially (nalbuphine, meperidine) or completely (butorphanol, buprenorphine) reversed withdrawal in abstinent pigeons. In contrast, the opioid kappa agonists trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl) benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate and bremazocine did not substitute for morphine or for naltrexone in dependent pigeons and did not reverse withdrawal in abstinent pigeons. Moreover, in dependent pigeons buprenorphine, butorphanol and nalbuphine, but not trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl)benzeneace tam ide methanesulfonate, antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine and of naltrexone. These results confirm in morphine-dependent pigeons qualitative differences in discriminative stimulus effects among mu and kappa opioid agonists and support the notion that differences among agonists under some conditions can result from variations in efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanisms by which the hypothalamic peptide somatostatin (SRIF) inhibits Ca+(+) influx were investigated in the pituitary cell line AtT-20. Cytosolic Ca+(+) levels were measured using the fluorescent probe Quin 2. Calcium influx was stimulated by the Ca+(+) channel agonist Bay K 8644. Bay K 8644 increased Ca+(+) influx in a concentration-dependent manner and the stimulation of Ca+(+) influx was blocked by the Ca+(+) channel antagonists nifedipine and nitrendipine. SRIF analogs also blocked Bay K 8644-stimulated Ca+(+) influx. The rank order of potency of the analogs (SRIF-28 greater than D-Trp8-SRIF greater than SRIF) suggests that the effects of SRIF are mediated by SRIF-28 preferring receptors. Pretreatment of AtT-20 cells with pertussis toxin abolished SRIF's inhibition of Bay K 8644-evoked Ca+(+) influx suggesting that G proteins mediate the inhibitory effects of SRIF on Ca+(+) influx. The K+ channel antagonists tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine and CsCl all stimulated Ca+(+) influx into AtT-20 cells. These agents did not alter Bay K 8644-evoked Ca+(+) influx or did they affect the ability of SRIF to inhibit Ca+(+) influx. Tetrodotoxin, the sodium channel blocker which inhibits action potential generation in AtT-20 cells, lowered basal Ca+(+) levels in AtT-20 cells but did not modify SRIF's inhibition of Bay K 8644-stimulated Ca+(+) influx. These findings suggest that SRIF receptors, linked directly to Ca+(+) channels via G proteins, may mediate SRIF's inhibition of Ca+(+) influx.\r"

Serial administration of 5-HT or of 5-carboxamidotryptamine induced slow tonic contractions that at higher concentrations of 5-HT (10(-4)-3 x 10(-4] were preceded by an initial relaxation and a fast phasic contraction. The concentration-response curves to both agonists were competitively shifted to the right by the mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide. The initial relaxation and fast phasic contraction were inhibited by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 and tetrodotoxin. Atropine blocked the fast phasic contraction, but enhanced the relaxation. During acetylcholine-induced contractions, 5-HT and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (greater than or equal to 10(-5) M), but not 5-carboxamidotryptamine, evoked relaxations that were blocked by ICS 205-930 and tetrodotoxin, but not by adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus, in the canine terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction, 5-HT stimulates neuronal 5-HT3 receptors and excitatory 5-HT1-like receptors located on smooth muscle. Stimulation of the 5-HT3 receptors results in an acetylcholine-mediated contraction and a relaxation mediated by an as yet unknown nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmitter.\r"

During a norepinephrine-induced contraction, noncumulative administration of ATP and the nicotinic agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) induced concentration-dependent relaxations in both the terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction; these responses were not inhibited by atropine, timolol or guanethidine. Desensitization to ATP blocked the ATP-induced relaxations, but not those to electrical stimulation or acetylcholine. All relaxations were abolished by tetrodotoxin. Theophylline or dipyridamole had no effect. Hexamethonium and desensitization to DMPP blocked the relaxations to acetylcholine and DMPP, but not those to electrical stimulation or ATP. The relaxations to acetylcholine, ATP and DMPP were inhibited by lidocaine. Thus, in the canine terminal ileum and ileocolonic junction, ATP induces NANC relaxations of neuronal origin, but ATP is unlikely to be the final NANC neurotransmitter mediating the relaxations to electrical stimulation or acetylcholine. These data also extend our previous observations on the presence of an inhibitory nicotinic innervation in these tissues.\r"

  ".U": "90347746\r", 
  ".W": "Elevation of potassium concentrations ([K+]) in the presence of Ca2+ is the most common method of evoking neurotransmitter release from synaptosomes. However, we have been investigating a method of releasing dopamine from synaptosomes that does not involve using elevated [K+]. In this paradigm of neurotransmitter release, dopamine is released from synaptosomes, previously exposed to micromolar or lower [Ca2+], by 1.25 mM Ca2+ in the presence of non-depolarizing [K+] (4.5 mM). The present experiments characterize the Ca2+ channel(s) involved in the Ca2(+)-evoked release of dopamine from synaptosomes, and determine whether the release is mediated by acetylcholine, glutamate or aspartate. omega-Conotoxin (10 nM), which blocks N-, L- and possibly T-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC), inhibited the Ca2(+)-evoked [3H]dopamine release from either striatal or olfactory tubercle synaptosomes to less than 50% of control. Neither 1 microM nifedipine nor 1 microM verapamil, which block L-type VSCC, affected Ca2(+)-evoked release. The N- and T-type VSCC blocker neomycin and the nonspecific Ca2+ antagonist, cobalt2+, inhibited release to a greater extent than omega-conotoxin. At 1 mM, both compounds inhibited release to approximately 30% of control. Neither the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate nor aspartate (2mM) affected 1 microM LY-171555 (a dopamine D2 agonist) inhibition of Ca2(+)-evoked [3H]dopamine release. Also, the glutamate antagonist, glutamic acid diethyl ester, did not affect either Ca2(+)-evoked release or 1 microM LY-171555 inhibition thereof. The nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (10 microM) and the muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 microM) were also ineffective in inhibiting Ca2(+)-evoked release or LY-171555 inhibition of release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SKF 38393 (5-20 mg/kg) and CY 208-243 (5-20 mg/kg) alone did not alter the accumulation of DOPA in the median eminence of male rats. However, the haloperidol-, reserpine- and neurotensin-induced increases in DOPA formation in the median eminence were antagonized dose-dependently by SKF 38393 (5-20 mg/kg i.p.) and/or CY 208-243 (5-20 mg/kg i.p.). Treatment of rats with SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a selective D1 antagonist, or loxapine (5 mg/kg i.p.), a dopamine antagonist with high affinity for D1 receptors, prevented the inhibitory effect of CY 208-243 on the haloperidol-induced activation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the median eminence. SKF 38393 did not inhibit the basal activity or the haloperidol-induced increase in activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum or nucleus accumbens. It is concluded that D1 receptor activation results in little or no effect on the basal rate of dopamine synthesis within tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, but under conditions in which the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase is increased D1 receptor stimulation results in a marked inhibition of the rate of dopamine synthesis within these neurons.\r"

  ".U": "90347749\r", 
  ".W": "Previous reports have shown that [Leu5]enkephalin or [Met5] enkephalin, endogenous delta receptor agonists, or synthetic analogues of these substances, can respectively produce a positive (i.e., increase) or negative (i.e., decrease) modulation of the antinociceptive potency of mu agonists such as morphine; such modulation is believed to be the result of interactions between delta and mu receptors. In spite of these studies showing modulation of mu agonist potency, it is unclear whether delta agonists can similarly modulate the antinociceptive efficacy of mu agonists. This question was addressed by using several levels of nociceptive stimulus intensity in mice. As the nociceptive stimulus intensity increased, the i.c.v. morphine dose-response line was shown to be displaced progressively to the right with decreasing maximal effect (i.e., decreased efficacy) a pattern typical of partial agonists. In contrast, the antinociceptive potency and efficacy of i.c.v. etorphine was unaffected by increasing the stimulus intensity, suggesting that this compound has higher efficacy than morphine in this nociceptive assay. Coadministration of delta opioid agonists produced leftward ([D-Pen2, D-Pen5] enkephalin) or rightward ([Met5]enkephalin) displacement of the morphine dose-response line (i.e., changes in potency). When the delta agonists were coadministered with morphine under conditions of high stimulus intensity, the maximal antinociceptive effects of i.c.v. morphine were increased or decreased from studies with morphine alone (i.e., change in efficacy). Both changes in potency and efficacy produced by the delta agonists, but not the direct antinociceptive effects of morphine, were blocked by the delta antagonist, ICI 174,864, suggesting that modulation occurred via the delta receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The cardioprotective effects of a new antiarrhythmic drug, TYB-3823 [1-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-dimethylaminoguanidine hydrochloride] were examined in the working hearts of rats and compared with those of lidocaine. Before ischemia, TYB-3823 at 5 x 10(-5) M produced a slight negative inotropic effect, resulting in a decrease in aortic flow and cardiac output. However, at lower concentrations (10(-6) and 10(-5) M), the drug had no significant effect on the functional cardiac parameters before ischemia. Lidocaine at such concentrations also had no effect. Global ischemia for 15 min decreased cardiac function rapidly which only recovered partially, with a delay, after reperfusion in the control hearts. Treatment with TYB-3823 accelerated the time course of recovery during reperfusion markedly, significantly improving functional cardiac parameters. However, lidocaine had little effect on recovery of function. Reperfusion-induced arrhythmia was equipotently inhibited by TYB-3823 and lidocaine. Leakage of cytosolic enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase and alpha-hydroxybutylic dehydrogenase) during reperfusion was inhibited more effectively by TYB-3823 than lidocaine. Light microscopic and electron microscopic examinations revealed that treatment with TYB-3823 protected against the histological damage induced by ischemia, such as hyaline degeneration of myocardium, absence of cross-striation and swelling of mitochondria. These results suggest that, unlike lidocaine, TYB-3823 causes a novel cardioprotective effect through unknown mechanisms in addition to its antiarrhythmic action.\r"

  ".W": "Rat hearts were isolated with the vagus nerves intact and perfused, and the neuronal acetylcholine stores were pulse labeled with [14C]choline. The overflow of [14C]choline/acetylcholine evoked by extrinsic vagus nerve stimulation (3 Hz and 720 pulses or 10 Hz and 1200 pulses) was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry and used as a measure for acetylcholine release. The postjunctional changes in atrial contraction and beating frequency were also recorded. Compared to controls, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline [but not clonidine, (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-amino)-2-imidazoline), methoxamine and norepinephrine] enhanced the evoked overflow of 14C-activity in a concentration-dependent manner without changing the ratio between choline and acetylcholine determined by paper chromatography. Norepinephrine (10 mumol/l) inhibited the evoked overflow in the presence of propranolol plus yohimbine. The oxyme-tazoline-induced increase in evoked overflow was unaffected by rauwolscine (1 mumol/l), idazoxan (0.3 and 5 mumol/l), and yohimbine (0.3 and 5 mumol/l), but significantly reduced by phentolamine (5 mumol/l), prazosin (0.03 mumol/l), the (-)-enantiomer of WB 4101 (0.1 mumol/l) and SK&F 104078 (3 mumol/l). The overflow of 14C-activity evoked by field stimulation was increased by oxymetazoline the absence and presence of hemicholinium-3. The results are compatible with an alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated facilitation of exocytotic acetylcholine release from the rat heart in vitro. The increase in evoked neurotransmitter overflow, however, was not accompanied by an increase in postjunctional heart responses to vagus stimulation due to nonselective blocking properties of the facilitating agonists.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperpolarization of dopamine neurons by activation of D2 and gamma-aminobutyric acidB receptors involves an increased conductance of K+ ions. Apamin, a blocker of Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels, has been reported to increase activity of dopamine neurons. Increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system is associated with increased motor activity. Thus, we investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of acute and daily microinjections of apamin into the A10 region of the rat. Apamin increased motor activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol. In postmortem analysis, 6.0 pmol of apamin significantly increased the levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the A10 region and of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the nucleus accumbens, and 2.0 pmol of apamin significantly increased the level of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. In vivo dialysis in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats revealed that apamin elevated extracellular dopamine metabolites. Rats receiving daily microinjections of apamin into the A10 region did not exhibit an augmentation in motor activity, suggesting that rats did not become sensitized to chronic treatment. These data are discussed in terms of the role of apamin-sensitive dopamine mechanisms in motor behavior and sensitization of these motor behaviors.\r"

  ".W": "Although hemoperfusion has been used to treat paraquat poisoning, its efficacy has been widely debated. This study examines the kinetic and pathologic correlates of paraquat toxicity and hemoperfusion and the efficacy of hemoperfusion in four groups of four dogs. This species was chosen because the kinetics and toxicity of paraquat are similar to those in the human. All dogs given a lethal dose of paraquat dichloride producing 100% mortality as a 2-hr infusion (7.48 mg of paraquat ion per kg) developed the typical clinical, laboratory and pathologic features of paraquat toxicity and died within 5 to 7 days. All dogs given paraquat and hemoperfused for 8 hr daily, beginning at 12 hr, died within 3 to 6 days. Two of four dogs which were hemoperfused once, beginning at 2 hr, survived. One dog in the repeated hemoperfusion only group died from blood loss. Negligible amounts of paraquat (0.4-2.0% of the total dose) were adsorbed during repeated hemoperfusion because of extensive excretion of paraquat in urine and sequestration in peripheral tissues from which redistribution was slow. The efficacy in the single early hemoperfusion group can be attributed to removal of 25% of the dose by the procedure in the two survivors. We conclude that single hemoperfusion may have some clinical application in patients who present within a few hours of the ingestion and have not ingested a dose of paraquat that is multiples of the lethal dose producing 100% mortality. It is doubtful if there is any role for repeated hemoperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Prejunctional beta adrenoceptors in canine bronchi (3rd to 6th order) were characterized by observing the effects of beta receptor agonists and antagonists on field stimulation-induced contractions and excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). Contractions were antagonized by norepinephrine (IC50 = 9.4 X 10(-7) M), isoproterenol (IC50 = 1.9 X 10(-8) M) or salbutamol (IC50 = 4.0 X 10(-8) M). EJPs were also decreased by all three agonists, with little or no effect on resting membrane potential or on carbachol-induced depolarization when used at concentrations sufficient to eliminate EJPs. These inhibitory effects were blocked by propranolol or timolol, as well as by the selective antagonists ICI 89,406 (beta-1-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta-2-selective); pA2 values for the selective antagonists were 8.4 and 7.2 (norepinephrine as agonist) or 6.5 and 9.0 (salbutamol as agonist), respectively. Control responses were also sometimes potentiated by the nonselective antagonists. Schild plot analysis of the data indicated clearly that both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors are involved in the inhibitory effect. Electron microscopic studies showed this tissue to be densely innervated by adrenergic and cholinergic nerves with close apposition of adrenergic and cholinergic nerve varicosities, providing a structural basis for prejunctional interactions between them. From the data presented, we conclude that catecholamines act on prejunctional beta-1 and beta-2 receptors leading to inhibition of cholinergic neurotransmission in canine bronchi.\r"

A retrospective study of 1633 persons discharged with pneumonia in 1983 showed that 61% to 62% had been discharged within the previous 4 years. Among these patients, 87% had had one or more high-risk conditions recognized during previous hospital admissions. A cohort study demonstrated that discharged patients had a 6% to 9% probability of readmission with pneumonia within 5 years. Each such readmission could be prevented by immunizing few (approximately 100) discharged patients with pneumococcal vaccine. Furthermore, the costs of vaccination would be approximately one-third the costs of hospital care for unvaccinated discharged patients readmitted with pneumonia. These results provide an epidemiologic rationale for current recommendations that elderly patients discharged from hospitals should be immunized with pneumococcal vaccine.\r"

Diastolic BP was inversely related to fitness in the boys and girls, and positively related to fatness for the boys. Systolic BP was positively related to fatness for the boys and girls. Using multiple regression and including parental BPs, fatness explained significant proportions of the variance in systolic BP for both the boys and girls and in diastolic BP for the boys. There were tendencies for central skin folds to explain more of the variation in BP than peripheral skin folds only for the boys. Fitness and fatness were inversely related for the boys and girls.

  ".W": "Low dietary intake of selenium has been proposed as a risk factor for breast cancer. To address this hypothesis, we collected toenail clippings from 62,641 women in the Nurses' Health Study cohort who were free from cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 1982 and 1983. The selenium concentration in nails has been shown to reflect dietary intake of selenium. During 53 months of follow-up, 434 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed among women who had submitted a set of toenail clippings, and we matched one control free from breast and other cancers to each case. The mean selenium level in toenails in the cases (0.823 microgram/g; SD, 0.197) was almost identical to that of the controls (0.821 microgram/g; SD, 0.174). After controlling for known breast cancer risk factors, the relative risk for women in the highest quintile of selenium as compared with the lowest quintile was 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 1.72) and there was no trend across quintiles. Results were similar for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Although these data do not exclude a possible influence of selenium intake before adulthood on subsequent risk of breast cancer, selenium intake later in life is not likely to be an important factor in the etiology of breast cancer.\r"

However, there are only limited data concerning intermediate care units for pulmonary patients. We prospectively followed up all Medicare patients from May 5, 1987, through May 4, 1988, who were admitted to a pulmonary noninvasive monitoring unit. Ninety-four patients were admitted 104 times; 33 required mechanical ventilatory support for an average of 26 days. The overall cost savings were greater than $173,000, while high-quality medical care was maintained. We conclude that a noninvasive monitoring unit can be effectively used as an alternative to the intensive care unit for selected pulmonary patients.\r"

Seventy-four percent believed their school had not adequately taught them what to do after a needle-stick injury, and half of them would not seek the services of the school's student health clinic. If the risk of infection following percutaneous exposure to HIV approaches seroconversion rates seen in prospective studies, then medical students are experiencing a serious occupational exposure. More research in this area is clearly necessary, but immediate steps should be taken by medical colleges to address the risks among medical students and implement appropriate training and safeguards.\r"

Review of all renal biopsy material at our institutions identified 42 pediatric patients who met the standard criteria for minimal change disease (MCD) on initial biopsies. Of those, 10 deteriorated clinically and on rebiopsy showed focal glomerular sclerosis (FGS). The initial renal biopsies of these 10 patients were analyzed morphometrically to determine the mean glomerular tuft area (GA). The results were compared to those of the remaining 32 patients whose subsequent benign clinical course was consistent with MCD, and to randomly selected, age-matched autopsy controls without renal disease (CONT, N = 10). The mean age was comparable among the three groups studied. Separate groups of adult (N = 12) and pediatric (N = 18) patients with initial biopsies with FGS were also studied. The initial biopsy of pediatric patients who subsequently showed FGS (rebiopsy performed on average 3.3 years later) had an average GA of 13.5 x 10(-3) mm2, 76% larger than glomeruli from children with MCD (7.7 x 10(-3) mm2, P less than 0.0005) and 62% larger than CONT (8.4 x 10(-3) mm2, P less than 0.005). Patients with FGS on initial biopsy, whether adult or pediatric, also had significantly larger GA than the age-matched MCD or CONT groups. Evaluation of GA in all the 42 pediatric biopsies with initial MCD further showed that in 23 patients GA was equal to or smaller than the CONT average.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repeated blood transfusions have been implicated in the induction and maintenance of sensitization. To determine the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy on five transfusion dependent, highly sensitized adolescents on dialysis, we serially measured percentage panel reactive antibody (%PRA) levels, titers of identifiable discrete anti-HLA Class I antibody specificities, and non-specific indices of cellular immunity before and following initiation of rHuEPO therapy. Although four of the five patients had previously rejected at least one renal allograft, the removal of chronic antigenic stimulation from blood transfusions led to a marked reduction in anti-HLA antibody titers to recognizable private and public specificities (P less than 0.001) and a reduction of mean %PRA from 80% to 56% (P less than 0.05). Each patient demonstrated a reduction of two or more dilutions to at least two anti-HLA antibody specificities. A control group of five patients matched for age, transfusion dependence and sensitization status demonstrated no change during a comparable time interval. PHA responsiveness decreased significantly in the rHuEPO group whereas autologous and allogenic mixed lymphocyte response, spontaneous blastogenesis and T-cell subsets did not. These data indicate that in highly sensitized dialysis patients rHuEPO may lead to decreased sensitization, shorter waiting time on dialysis and possibly improved allograft survival rates.\r"

  ".W": "Lithium salts are widely used agents for the prophylactic treatment of affective disorders. Lithium salts may be associated with distal nephron dysfunction. Kallikrein is a protease which is generated by the distal nephron. We used an amidolytic assay of chromatographically purified enzyme to determine the urinary excretion rate of active kallikrein in relation to lithium treatment. All plasma lithium concentrations were within the therapeutic range (0.4 to 0.9 mmol/liter). In 15 patients the urinary excretion rate of active kallikrein was 267.4 +/- 65.6 mU/24 hrs before lithium treatment, and fell to 117.8 +/- 39.6 mU/24 hrs (P less than 0.05) on day 14 of lithium treatment. This reduction was associated with a decrease of immunoreactive kallikrein in the same urines by 66%. In another 15 patients who had undergone lithium therapy for an average period of 5.6 years, the urinary excretion rate of active kallikrein was 86.1 +/- 14.5 mU/24 hrs, while 21 age-matched healthy controls had an excretion rate of 364.1 +/- 58.4 mU/24 hrs (P less than 0.05). Measurements of immunoreactive kallikrein in the same urine samples demonstrated a reduction of kallikrein after long-term lithium treatment by 78%. These observations could not be attributed to changes in creatinine clearance, renal sodium or potassium excretion rates or plasma concentrations of aldosterone and vasopressin. Addition of lithium to the urine in vitro had no demonstrable effect on kallikrein measurement by amidolytic assay. We conclude that lithium in therapeutic plasma concentrations may directly suppress the secretion of kallikrein by renal connecting tubule cells.\r"

Initial cellular IL-2 production was increased in patients with hemodialysis, compared to normal controls. The ratio of pretreatment cellular IL-2 and IL-1 production was increased in all patient groups compared to normal subjects. Both hemodialysis and CAPD treatments resulted in increased cellular IL-1 (51.7%, P less than 0.007, and 42.8%, P less than 0.002, respectively) and IL-2 production (50.5%, P less than 0.015, and 33.3%, P less than 0.0008, respectively). The hemodialysis group had significantly higher cellular IL-2 production compared with normal controls' after treatment. After treatment, the IL-2/IL-1 ratio remained elevated in all groups with renal disease compared with normal subjects. We conclude patients with renal disease have an abnormal functional relationship between IL-1 and IL-2, characterized by increased IL-2 production per level of IL-1, unaffected by type or presence of renal replacement therapy.\r"

In seven additional subjects the acute renal, metabolic and hormonal response to ingestion of a meat or soya load of equivalent total protein content was investigated (acute study).

The single allele, DQW2, was found in 72% of steroid sensitive patients compared with only 35% of the controls (P = 0.003). In half of 32 steroid sensitive, but not 10 steroid resistant, patients, one or both of two specific extended haplotypes (alleles that segregate together) were identified.

The other, [HLA-B44, DR7, DRW53, FC31], occurred in 10 of 64 haplotypes, 16% compared to 3.8% of controls (P = 0.014). Five patients had both haplotypes. Patients with these specific extended haplotypes had a greater frequency of relapses than did those with other haplotypes.

Previously, it has been determined that subjects with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) produce the lymphokine, soluble immune response suppressor (SIRS). In the present group of experiments, a potential pathway of suppressor cell activation was investigated. Sera from patients with SRNS stimulated normal CD8+ lymphocytes to produce SIRS. Serum SIRS-inducing activity was abrogated by treatment with proteinase K or boiling, but was not affected by dialysis, acidification to pH 2, or heating to 56 degrees C. This serum factor could be distinguished functionally and antigenically from SIRS and from interferon (IFN) alpha or IFN gamma. Supernatants of cultured patient lymphocytes enriched for CD4+ cells were also found to activate normal CD8+ lymphocytes to produce SIRS. The lymphocyte-derived activity showed similar characteristics to those of the serum factor. Molecular weight of both factors was estimated to be 13,000 to 18,000 daltons by gel filtration chromatography, and activity of serum and lymphocyte supernatant from the same patients eluted with similar patterns on reversed-phase HPLC. These data suggest that serum SIRS-inducing activity is derived from a suppressor-inducer lymphocyte, and indicate the presence of a regulatory mechanism for SIRS production in steroid-responsive nephrotic patients.\r"

Blood flows to the filter ranged from 75 to 100 ml/min; mean filtration fraction was 64 +/- 1% (+/- SE, N = 188). Mean plasma removal rate per treatment was 40.2 +/- 0.6 ml/min; net plasma removed per treatment was 3231 +/- 53 ml (N = 188); mean treatment time was 83 +/- 2 minutes (N = 188). Mean percent decline in platelet count was 15 +/- 4% (N = 46). Immunoglobulin kinetics were evaluated in order to validate our method of treatment prescription. The apparent volume of distribution (AVD) for each immunoglobulin class was compared to our estimate for plasma volume (EPV). The fraction AVD/EPV for IgG was 0.97 +/- 0.04 (N = 14), for IgA was 0.87 +/- 0.04 (N = 13) and for IgM was 0.96 +/- 0.3 (N = 26). Use of the EPV allowed for accurate prediction of treatment results. Correlation between expected and actual decline in serum levels revealed an r value of 0.86 for IgG (P = 0.0002), 0.88 for IgA (P = 0.0001), and 0.57 for IgM (P less than 0.003). We conclude that a rotating filter system can provide a highly efficient means of plasma exchange. The use of a simplified method of estimating plasma volume allows for a reliable prediction of treatment results.\r"

  ".W": "Transport of solutes during osmotically-induced transperitoneal ultrafiltration is less than would be predicted based upon rates of transperitoneal solute diffusion. Previous workers have hypothesized that osmotically-induced convective solute transport occurs only in small pores at the arteriolar end of peritoneal capillaries, whereas solute diffusion occurs only through large venular pores. We tested this heteroporosity hypothesis in the eviscerated New Zealand White rabbit by determining sieving coefficients (S) for creatinine, p-aminohippurate (PAH) and neutral dextran during hydraulically-induced transperitoneal ultrafiltration (N = 13). A hydraulically-induced driving force directs convective solute transport through the same capillary pores employed for diffusion; therefore S for all solutes should approach unity if the heteroporosity hypothesis is valid. S for creatinine and PAH were respectively 0.72 +/- 0.03 and 0.67 +/- 0.05, values lower than unity and not different from those previously determined during osmotically induced ultrafiltration. Mean S for dextran were relatively independent of molecular size, ranging from 0.50 at 13 A to 0.40 at 50 A. Thus, dextran S were higher than those previously determined during osmotically induced ultrafiltration yet still less than unity. Control experiments (N = 6) suggested that only surface area and not transport characteristics were altered by evisceration. These observations demonstrate that the heteroporosity hypothesis fails to completely describe both diffusive and convective transport properties of the peritoneum.\r"

  ".W": "Severe reduction in renal mass (greater than 50%) in the rat uniformly results in progressive glomerular injury and loss of remnant nephrons postulated to be due to increases in glomerular function (hyperfiltration) and/or size (hypertrophy). Reduction in renal mass in the rat also leads to the development of systemic and/or glomerular hypertension. To examine the independent contributions of systemic hypertension and glomerular hyperfiltration and/or hypertrophy to progressive glomerular injury, a normotensive rat remnant kidney model was developed in the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) strain. Of the 34 WKY rats that underwent 5/6 nephrectomy, 25 remained normotensive and without evidence of morphologic glomerular injury and/or nephron loss for up to 14 to 16 weeks, despite glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy comparable to that previously observed in other rat strains. Micropuncture studies at approximately six weeks after reduction in renal mass demonstrated markedly increased SNGFR in remnant nephrons of normotensive rats as compared to controls (66 +/- 7 vs. 25 +/- 4 nl/min, P less than 0.01), but glomerular capillary pressures (PGC) estimated from stop flow pressures were only slightly increased (52.7 +/- 1 vs. 47.3 +/- 1 mm Hg, P less than 0.01). These data indicate that compensatory glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertrophy after 5/6 nephrectomy may not lead to progressive glomerular injury provided hypertension does not develop. These data further suggest that in the absence of systemic hypertension, increases in PGC required for adaptive hyperfiltration, may not be sufficient to initiate progressive glomerular injury and nephron loss.\r"

  ".W": "The adrenergic nervous system is active in kidney function, and the kidney has large numbers of adrenergic receptor subtypes. Because of the cellular complexity of the kidney, it is difficult to obtain direct assessments of adrenergic receptor binding characteristics over specific tissue compartments. Qualitative autoradiography allows the localization of adrenergic receptors over tissue types in the kidney, but quantitative autoradiography allows direct comparison of adrenergic receptor number over different cellular compartments. The purpose of this study was to obtain direct assessments of alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta adrenergic receptor numbers over different tissue compartments of the kidney using quantitative autoradiography. Sections of Sprague-Dawley rat kidney were incubated in several concentrations of 3H-dihydroalprenolol to label beta receptors, 3H-prazosin to label alpha 1 receptors and 3H-rauwolscine to label the alpha 2 receptors. Sections of rat heart incubated in 3H-dihydroalprenolol were included as standards. The sections were then prepared for receptor autoradiography. After processing, the grains were then quantified on an image analysis system, and binding curves constructed from the specific binding. In some animals, the proximal tubules were stained to localize the proximal convoluted tubules. Significant Scatchard analyses were obtained in the glomeruli with dihydroalprenolol (5.18 X 10(9) receptors/mm3) and with rauwolscine (2.48 X 10(9) receptors/mm3). Significant Scatchard analyses were obtained in the cortex with rauwolscine (9.47 X 10(9) receptors/mm3) and with prazosin (3.9 X 10(9)). In addition, specific binding was seen with rauwolscine and prazosin to the kidney arterioles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) is associated with the concomitant activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems. In vivo studies suggest that a positive interaction may occur between AVP and angiotensin II (Ang II), and other Ca2+ mobilizing hormones. In the present study, the cellular mechanisms of this interaction between AVP and Ang II in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) were examined. These results support the existence of a positive interaction between AVP and Ang II on Ca2+ mobilization in VSMC. In fact, the challenge of VSMC with combined AVP and Ang II, in a range from 5 x 10(-11) to 10(-8) M, enhanced cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and 45Ca2+ efflux in a more than additive manner. This potentiation, which was not dependent of the presence of extracellular calcium, correlated with an increased VSMC shape change. Moreover, the combination of subthreshold doses of AVP and Ang II (5 x 10(-11) M), which do not release Ca2+ alone, evoked a Ca2+ mobilizing response. A subthreshold dose of Ang II also shifted to the left the concentration-response curve of the AVP-mediated 45Ca2+ efflux. Since there were no changes in receptor binding of either hormone by the other hormone and the interaction of the two hormones on the production of inositol phosphatides was additive, the AVP and AII positive interaction on Ca2+ mobilization on VSMC may occur at the level of the intracellular Ca2(+)-releasing mechanism itself. Such an interaction can occur at hormone concentrations below the Ca2+ release threshold and may explain an increased functional response to the combination of pressor hormones compared to that of each hormone alone.\r"

The present study applies flow cytometry, the technique of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, to the study of brush border membrane vesicles. Direct comparison was made of enzymatic marker purity of rat renal cortical brush border membrane vesicles prepared by divalent ion precipitation, or flow cytometry sorting. Flow cytometry sorted membrane vesicles were characterized by greater brush border membrane markers, no detectable mitochondrial or basolateral markers, and greatly reduced Golgi and lysosomal markers. The flow sorted membrane vesicles were functional for transport studies as they took up at least as much 3H-proline and 3H-glucose per mg protein as divalent ion precipitation membrane vesicles. Preparation of membrane vesicles from superficial and deep cortex allowed us to image the different distributions of gamma-glutamyl transferase in membrane vesicles from these areas. Hence, membrane vesicle populations of exceptional purity can be separated according to fluorescent markers using flow cytometry. High speed observations on large numbers of individual vesicles allows identification of subpopulations, and statistical comparison, within a single heterogeneous sample.\r"

The combined organs cleared intact PTH significantly faster than the single kidneys (P less than 0.02) or livers (P less than 0.02), but not faster than the sum of the clearances in the single organs. The kidneys cleared intact PTH without accumulation of NH2-terminal, mid-molecule or COOH-terminal iPTH, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) studies did not reveal any PTH fragments. The livers cleared mid-molecule and COOH-terminal iPTH significantly slower (P less than 0.002) than intact PTH, and HPLC demonstrated generation of mid-molecule and COOH-terminal PTH fragments. The combined organs accumulated significantly less mid-molecule (P less than 0.001) and COOH-terminal (P less than 0.03) iPTH than the single livers, and HPLC demonstrated mid-molecule peaks that were smaller but not qualitatively different. In conclusion, the predominance of COOH-terminal PTH fragments in plasma may be maintained by differential clearance mainly in the liver, excessive accumulation being prevented by filtration in the kidneys.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to evaluate the physiological relevance of this finding by establishing the presence of CaM-KII in rabbit kidney and proximal convoluted tubule cells by Northern RNA hybridization analysis to demonstrate the messenger RNA (mRNA) for CaM-KII and by a selective enzymatic assay of CaM-KII using a synthetic peptide substrate. A single 4.9 Kb mRNA was observed on hybridization of total RNA from rabbit kidney cortex and medulla and from an enriched suspension of rabbit kidney proximal convoluted tubules with a cDNA for rat brain CaM-KII. An enzyme assay using a synthetic peptide substrate representing the site phosphorylated by CaM-KII on glycogen synthase demonstrated calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase activity in both rabbit kidney cortex (specific activity of 662 +/- 127 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1) and proximal tubule cells (546 +/- 77 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1). These data establish the presence of CaM-KII in the rabbit kidney, and suggest a role for this enzyme in the control of renal electrolyte transport.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that norepinephrine (NE) and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (I), enhance fluid absorption (JV) in isolated, perfused proximal convoluted tubule segments (PCT). Pretreatment of PCT with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, inhibited the action of NE and produced a significant decline in JV, suggesting modulation of JV by both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. The present studies further characterize the alpha-adrenoceptor control of JV in isolated perfused PCT using specific agonists and antagonists. Basal JV declined significantly with the addition of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (10(-4) M), to the bath; however, it was unchanged with the addition of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine (10(-6) or 10(-4) M). With the addition of 10(-6) M isoproterenol JV increased significantly, and returned to control values with the subsequent addition of clonidine (10(-6) or 10(-4) M). Pretreatment of PCT with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (10(-5) M), or with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) did not interfere with the stimulation of JV by isoproterenol, but abolished the inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated JV by clonidine. Thus, clonidine inhibits JV in PCT via an alpha 2-adrenoceptor. This effect is mediated by a pertussis toxin inhibitable GTP-binding protein, but not one that is coupled to adenylyl cyclase.\r"

Both in complement-normal B10.D2 new and in C5-deficient B10.D2 old mice, PMN depletion completely prevented the albuminuria occurring after injection of low doses of anti-GBM serum, and severely depressed the albuminuria after injection of high doses. In immunofluorescence, glomerular deposition of antibody and C3 was similar to that in control mice. The glomerular influx of PMNs in both the complement-normal and C5-deficient controls was inhibited to 10% or less of control values. Fibrin deposition or necrosis did not occur. Injection of F(ab')2 fragments of the anti-GBM antibody in non-irradiated mice caused only limited PMN influx and reduced the albuminuria to physiological levels, although the binding of 125I labeled F(ab')2 fragments to the glomeruli was as high as 82% of that of the complete antibody. We conclude that the albuminuria in this model is Fc-dependent and largely, if not completely, dependent on the influx of PMNs in the glomeruli. Among the many experimental models of anti-GBM nephritis, this is the first one in which the heterologous phase is complement-independent but PMN-dependent.\r"

However, estrogens have major side effects related to their hormonal activity. We investigated whether a beta-resorcylic acid lactone, zeranol (a compound with close spatial similarity to estrogens but with a weak estrogenic activity), improves primary hemostasis in uremic rats and whether the effect is mediated by estrogen receptors. The results showed that single oral administration of zeranol significantly (P less than 0.01) shortened the bleeding time of uremic rats, 20 mg/kg being the minimum effective dose. This effect was long-lasting (72 hours). The dose of 30 mg/kg zeranol reproduced the pattern observed after 20 mg/kg but bleeding time values were still significantly (P less than 0.01) shortened 96 hours after the administration. No changes in hematocrit, platelet and leukocyte count, and serum creatinine were detected after zeranol administration. When uremic rats were pre-treated orally with two estrogen receptor antagonists, tamoxifen and clomiphene (3 mg/kg), zeranol did not shorten the bleeding time, thus suggesting that the hemostatic effect of zeranol was due to an estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms. These results might have important future implications for the management of uremic bleeding in humans.\r"

In non-involved stomach, Lewis(a) and Lewis(b) were detected mainly in surface epithelium, although sialated Lewis(a) was scarcely expressed. These blood group-related antigens were rarely observed in deep glands. In gastric cancers, Lewis(a) showed a tendency to be expressed in well or moderately differentiated carcinomas, and this was observed to be more marked in advanced tumors. There was no obvious difference in positive ratios of Lewis(b) between degrees of differentiation of the cancers. Sialated Lewis(a) was not detected in early cancers, and its frequent expression in well- or moderately differentiated, advanced carcinomas suggested an association with both cancer differentiation and progression. These results indicate that knowledge of the expression of blood group antigens may help interpret the antigenic alterations occurring in the course of carcinogenesis, differentiation, and progression of gastric cancers.\r"

Most patients had already failed other palliative modalities including chemotherapy, laser debridement, dilation, and electrocautery.

Within 7 years 105 patients were operated on; 75 patients were followed up for at least 2 years postoperatively with a median follow-up of 30 months (range 24-93 months). The median time interval when patients were free of tumor recurrence was only 9 months. The initial recurrence site was the liver in 47% and the other sites were extrahepatic in 39%. Seventy-one percent of the patients developed disseminated metastases as the disease progressed. The median survival time after diagnosis of tumor recurrence was 14 months and was significantly affected by the type of treatment used for the recurrence. Surgical resection was followed by a 23-month median survival, while systemic and intra-arterial chemotherapy led to a 14- and 15-month median survival time, respectively. Untreated patients had a median survival of only 4 months. It is concluded that liver resection for colorectal secondaries leads to a very limited number of disease-free survivors after 5 years. As a few patients may profit from a surgical treatment even in cases of recurrence, surgery should not be regarded as useless.\r"

A study was undertaken to explore the effect of radiation and hyperthermia on the responsiveness of melanoma following active immunization with lethally irradiated B16 melanoma cells in C57 BL 6 mice. Two groups of mice were treated: group 1 received immunotherapy on days 2-5 following tumor inoculation, and group 2 received immunotherapy on days 15-18 following tumor inoculation. The mice in each group were subsequently randomized into one of three subgroups: 1) no further treatment; 2) radiation therapy alone (6 Gy in a single fraction); 3) radiation therapy and regional hyperthermia (43 degrees C x 1 hour). Tumor sizes were measured regularly, and between day 52 and 63 the animals were sacrificed and the lungs sectioned for counting of metastatic tumors. Results from this study show that the immunomodulated B16 murine melanoma is responsive to radiation therapy alone and that this responsiveness is enhanced by the addition of adjuvant regional hyperthermia. There did not appear to be any significant effect of radiation therapy or radiation therapy plus hyperthermia on the development of lung metastases in this tumor model system.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1978 to December 1987 we operated on 135 patients with calcified mitral stenosis. In 60 patients a conservative operation was performed (group I). Nine patients required mitral annuloplasty associated with the commissurotomy. The other 75 patients underwent mitral valve replacement (group II). In 37 patients a mechanical prosthesis was used and in 38 a biologic one. The patients given mitral valve replacement had a more heavily calcified valve than those undergoing a conservative procedure. Twenty-one patients (12 from group I and 13 from group II) required associated tricuspid annuloplasty. The mean follow-up time was 69.1 months (1 months to 10 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of operative death (0% and 4%, respectively), postoperative functional class, actuarial survival rate at 10 years (84% and 96%, respectively), and probability of freedom from thromboemboli at 10 years (98% and 96%, respectively). However, the probability of freedom from reoperation at 10 years significantly favored the conservative surgery group (84% and 69%, respectively, p less than 0.01). Finally, the probability of freedom from complications at 10 years was also significantly higher in the conservative surgery group (82% and 64%, respectively, p less than 0.005). Because of these results we believe that conservative surgery is, at present, a better alternative than mitral valve replacement for patients with partially calcified mitral stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Doppler echocardiography was used to measure gradients and valve areas at rest and after supine bicycle exercise in 35 patients with valve replacements 20 to 23 mm in size. Thirteen patients with a St. Jude Medical valve (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) were matched to 13 patients with an allograft valve, and seven patients with a Medtronic Intact (porcine) valve (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) to seven patients with an allograft valve. Patients were matched for age, sex, valve size, body surface area, and left ventricular systolic function. There was no statistically significant difference between the matched groups for body surface areas, resting cardiac output, exercise heart rate, or workload achieved. Mean pressure gradient was higher for St. Jude Medical than for allograft groups, both at rest (11.8 +/- 6.67 mm Hg for St. Jude Medical versus 6.67 +/- 2.98 mm Hg for allografts) and after exercise (16.4 +/- 8.47 mm Hg versus 9.7 +/- 3.94 mm Hg), but the differences were of borderline significance (p = 0.016 and 0.027, respectively). Valve area at rest was similar for both devices (1.4 +/- 0.45 cm2 for St. Jude Medical versus 1.8 +/- 0.56 cm2 for allograft; p greater than 0.1). There were highly significant differences between patients with Intact and those with allograft valves for resting mean pressure gradient (19.3 +/- 4.23 mm Hg for Intact versus 5.9 +/- 3.68 mm Hg for allograft; p less than 0.001) and for exercise mean pressure gradient (27.8 +/- 8.63 mm Hg versus 8.1 +/- 8.43 mm Hg; p less than 0.001). The differences between the valve areas at rest also were significant (1.1 +/- 0.12 cm2 versus 2.2 +/- 0.62 cm2; p less than 0.01). It is concluded that when a tissue valve is indicated in patients with a small aortic root, the freehand allograft aortic valve is an ideal device from the hemodynamic perspective and is superior to the Intact valve. It is also probably superior in this respect to the St. Jude Medical valve, although the analysis may be biased slightly in favor of the allograft valve.\r"

There were 24 boys and 26 girls. The valve replaced was mitral in 28 children, aortic in 15, mitral and aortic in 1, and mitral and tricuspid in 1. A left-sided tricuspid valve was replaced in 3 children. Anticoagulant therapy was maintained in all children; 40 children were treated with warfarin, whereas 10 children who underwent aortic or mitral valve replacement were on a regimen of aspirin combined with dipyridamole. The follow-up period, comprising 224 patient-years, ranged from 1 to 10 years. There were four valve-related complications: one from thromboembolism, two from valve thrombosis, and the other one from prosthetic valve endocarditis. Actuarial rate free from all valve-related complications at 10 years was 84.7%. There were four late deaths: one from valve thrombosis and the others from non-valve-related complications. Actuarial survival rate at 10 years was 90.8%. All surviving children are in functional class I, and no child so far has needed replacement of a prosthesis because of somatic growth. These results indicate that the St. Jude Medical prosthesis is a cardiac valve substitute of choice for valve replacement in children.\r"

Herein we report the successful concomitant repair of severe tracheal stenosis and complex cardiac anomaly with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass in two cases. The first patient was a 5-year-old boy with tetralogy of Fallot associated with a localized intrathoracic tracheal stenosis caused by complete cartilaginous rings. Tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis combined with total correction of tetralogy of Fallot was performed with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. The second patient was a 5-month-old girl with a pulmonary artery sling, scimitar syndrome, and extensive tracheal stenosis. The patient underwent definitive correction of cardiac lesions and complete tracheal reconstruction with a cartilaginous graft with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. Utmost care was paid to avoid contamination during the operation. Both of the patients are doing well at present without any signs of complication, 2 years 5 months and 1 year 10 months after the operation, respectively. We advocate concomitant repair of both lesions, with cardiopulmonary bypass, in the surgical managements of infants and small children who have a difficult and otherwise fatal combination of complex congenital cardiac anomaly and severe intrathoracic tracheal stenosis.\r"

In 240 consecutive patients the median length of hospital stay after operation was 4 days. The operations included coronary artery bypass procedures, aortic valve replacements, and mitral valve operations. Six patients (2.5%) were rehospitalized within 6 months after discharge and five patients (2.1%) were rehospitalized 6 to 24 months after discharge: Longer initial hospitalizations would not have prevented rehospitalizations. Forty of the 240 patients were discharged on the third postoperative day or earlier (one patient). None died or were rehospitalized in the following 2 years. Prevention or quick correction of noncardiac disorders allowed rapid recovery after heart operations, and rapid recovery indicated that health would be maintained.\r"

Completeness of denervation was evaluated by recording hemodynamic responses to sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension, phenylephrine-induced hypertension, and direct cardiac autonomic nerve stimulations acutely (group I, n = 11) and 2 weeks after denervation (group II, n = 5). Serial drug infusion studies were performed during an 8-month period in group III animals (n = 11). Myocardial biopsies for catecholamine content were done in groups II and III. Both direct and reflex hemodynamic responses to autonomic neural stimulation were abolished in the acutely denervated hearts. Furthermore, at 2 weeks, direct neural stimulation was without effect, and myocardial catecholamine content was 95% depleted (p less than 0.001). Serial drug infusion studies revealed a changing spectrum of responses, suggesting the onset of reinnervation by 8 months following the procedure. Myocardial catecholamine content was 85% depleted at that time (p less than 0.001). Cryosurgical cardiac denervation is an effective technique offering the advantages of safety, simplicity, and completeness.\r"

Left ventricular oxygen consumption before and after 25 minutes of warm (37 degrees C) global ischemia was linearly related to a function (integral) of left ventricular circumferential systolic wall stress, altered by changing afterload. The relation is expressed in the two regression equations: LVO2 (preischemic) = 1.06.SSI + 16.8 (n = 129; r = 0.79); LVO2 (postischemic) = 4.35.SSI + 5.6 (n = 89; r = 0.65). The fourfold increase in slope (4.35 versus 1.06) indicates (p = 0.0001) a massive increase of oxygen consumption in postischemic, globally \"stunned\" myocardium. The inferences are that globally stunned myocardium causes severe impairment of oxygen utilization efficiency, and increased vulnerability to further ischemia if coronary vessels are diseased.\r"

  ".U": "90348222\r", 
  ".W": "Hypothermic total circulatory arrest for repair of congenital heart lesions in neonates requires a period of rapid core cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass during which the myocardium is also exposed to hypothermic perfusion. Myocardial hypothermia in the nonarrested state results in an increase in contractility due to elevation of intracellular calcium levels. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that rapid myocardial cooling before cardioplegic ischemic arrest results in damage, with impaired recovery during reperfusion. Two groups of 10 rabbit hearts were perfused on an isolated Langendorff apparatus. Group N (normothermia) was perfused at 37 degrees C before 2 hours of cardioplegic ischemic arrest at 10 degrees C. Group C (cooling) was perfused at 15 degrees C in the unarrested state for 20 minutes before the same cardioplegic arrest conditions as group N. Left ventricular isovolumic pressure measurements, biochemical measurements from right ventricular biopsy specimens, and ventricular necrosis as defined by tetrazolium staining were used to compare the groups at 30 and 60 minutes of normothermic reperfusion. Developed pressure at a constant volume was preserved in group N at 90.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg versus 76.9 +/- 6.3 in group C after reperfusion (p less than 0.05). Diastolic compliance showed significant deterioration in group C, with marked elevation of diastolic pressure during reperfusion (group N = 6.8 +/- 2.5 mm Hg versus group C = 38.9 +/- 6.1 after reperfusion; p less than 0.001). Adenosine triphosphate levels were significantly higher in group N both at end-ischemia and after reperfusion versus group C (group N = 17.0 +/- 1.1 nmol/mg protein versus group C = 7.7 +/- 1.0 after reperfusion; p less than 0.001). Group N had 0.4% +/- 0.4% necrosis of ventricular mass versus 19.3% +/- 2.2% with prearrest cooling in group C (p less than 0.0001). These results indicate that, when combined with cardioplegic ischemic arrest, rapid myocardial cooling in the unarrested state results in significant damage. The mechanism may be related to the cytosolic calcium loading effect of hypothermia that is not relieved during the subsequent period of cardioplegic arrest. Although hypothermia is an essential component to ischemic preservation, rapid cooling contracture can adversely influence cardioplegic myocardial protection.\r"

Mammary grafts were done at initial operation in 59% of patients who have had one operation versus only 46% of patients who subsequently required reoperation (p less than 0.001). The overall operative mortality rate was 2.0% (134/6591) for primary coronary bypass versus 6.9% (35/508) for reoperations (p less than 0.001). Patients with a reoperative interval of 1 to 10 years had a 6.0% (18/312) mortality rate, compared with 17.6% (13/74) for those in whom the interval between operations was greater than 10 years (p less than 0.01).

Including perioperative mortality, the actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 80% for reoperations versus 90% for primary operations. The corresponding figures at 10 years were 65% and 75%. The probability of undergoing reoperation within 5 and 10 years was 0.034 +/- 0.003 and 0.055 +/- 0.005, respectively. Ten years postoperatively, 36% of patients having the initial operation had recurrent angina whereas 58% of the reoperative group had significant recurrent angina. Ten years after reoperation, 30% of operative survivors were free of heart-related morbidity and mortality compared with 50% of patients having a primary operation. Univariate analysis of factors increasing the probability of reoperation include the absence of a mammary graft and younger age at operation. Patients undergoing a second bypass operation represent a substantially higher risk subgroup than patients undergoing initial operation in terms of perioperative morbidity, mortality, decreased long-term survival, and decreased relief of recurrent cardiac morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 267 infants and children who underwent the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries in the 6 years before Jan. 1, 1988 in six main Japanese institutions were entered into this review. The current status of patients surviving more than 1 year after the operation were evaluated along with early operative results. One hundred forty-six patients had an intact ventricular septum, 103 had a significant ventricular septal defect, and 18 had so-called Taussig-Bing anomaly of the transposition type. Eighteen patients were less than 28 days of age, 73 were 1 to 5 months of age, and 176 were older than 6 months of age at the time of operation. The overall mortality rate was 35% in the first 3 years and 12% in the more recent 3 years. There was a significant difference between the overall mortality rate of primary and two-stage repair (22% versus 10%, p = 0.047) in patients with intact ventricular septum. The overall mortality rate in patients with type B or C coronary arteries of Yacoub, and Radley-Smith's classification was significantly higher than that of other types of arteries (86% versus 18%, p = 0.0001). A total of 156 patients survived more than 1 year after the operation, and 44 children (28%) were noted to have supravalvular pulmonary stenosis (greater than 20 mm Hg). This complication was more common in patients operated on in the newborn period. Trivial or mild aortic regurgitation was noted in 29 patients (19%) and was more common in patients with two-stage than with primary repair (24% versus 14%). Aortic regurgitation was significantly more prevalent in patients in whom coronary arteries were implanted into slits or U-shaped defects than in those whose arteries were implanted into punched-out holes made on the pulmonary root (28% versus 8%, p = 0.049). Normal sinus rhythm was present in 97% of 154 patients and left ventricular ejection fraction was within the normal range in 97% of 115 patients at catheterization 1 to 5 months after the operation.\r"

Because establishment of a direct systemic to coronary blood flow is expected to provide the best recovery of left ventricular function, various corrective procedures have been proposed. Subclavian-left coronary artery anastomosis appears to be a logical approach. Four patients operated on at Sainte-Justine Hospital, at an average age of 33 months (27 to 44), with an end-to-end subclavian-left coronary artery anastomosis were evaluated 6 to 46 months postoperatively. The anastomosis was patent in all cases. End-diastolic volume index (74.6 +/- 24.7 versus 122.7 +/- 15.3 ml/m2) and ejection fraction (0.58 +/- 0.07 versus 0.33 +/- 0.06) were improved significantly. Subclavian-left coronary artery anastomosis appears to meet the main criteria for an optimal physiologic correction of anomalous left coronary artery: restoration of a two-coronary artery system, improvement of left ventricular function, and likelihood of long-term patency.\r"

All patients had standardized anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. After reversal of heparin, autologous platelet-rich plasma was reinfused in nine patients. Thrombocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were calculated before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass, and 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Blood loss and total number of transfusions were recorded. Although 9% of the total platelet volume was removed, there were no hemodynamic complications related to the use of the Haemonetics Plasma Saving System. In both groups, significant low levels of thrombocytes, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were seen after cardiopulmonary bypass. Platelet-rich plasma-reinfused patients had a significantly higher number of platelets after heparin reversal. They also had significantly less blood loss after the operation, necessitating 65% less banked blood products (p less than 0.05). We concluded that reinfusion of autologous platelet-rich plasma may serve as an effective and safe way to restore some of the hematologic derangements after cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

All patients with metastasis to two nodes died within 4 years of operation, and all with involvement of three nodes or more died within 3 years. Even with no metastases or single node metastasis, three of 22 patients (13.6%) died of recurrence or metastasis or a combination of the two. Although nodal dissection may be beneficial for selected patients, our results indicate that the survival period is short in the presence of a small number of lymph node metastases, even if the local disease is resectable and despite nodal dissection. Cure is unlikely when cervical or abdominal nodes are involved, and a conservative approach may be indicated for such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Routine epicardial two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler, and Doppler color flow imaging studies were performed before and after cardiopulmonary bypass in 328 patients undergoing operations for congenital heart disease. Ages ranged from 1 day to 59 years (mean 5.9 years); the smallest patient was 1.8 kg. Complete examinations were conducted in 3.6 +/- 1.7 minutes. Prebypass examinations demonstrated previously unappreciated details of anatomy in 60 patients (18%), which did not relate to whether catheterization had been performed, and they were believed to play a role in surgical planning in 143 patients (44%). Discovery of previously unrecognized features of anatomy increased the impact of echo-Doppler color flow imaging on operative planning by 2.5 times. After bypass, echo-Doppler color flow imaging disclosed unsuspected residual defects in 22 patients (7%) who were doing well clinically and enabled an attempt at immediate revision of the procedure. When ultimate clinical outcome was compared to postbypass findings of echo-Doppler color flow imaging, the presence of a residual defect, right or left ventricular dysfunction, or any concern with the heart by echo-Doppler color flow imaging appeared to serve as a predictor of unfavorable outcome (p less than 0.001 for each when compared with absence of these difficulties). Thus routine intraoperative echo-Doppler color flow imaging is useful in aiding the planning, conduct, and assessment of results in operations for congenital heart disease.\r"

In order to determine if the pattern was maintained by electrical activity or trophic factors, we compared the effect of electrical block by local neural application of tetrodotoxin with the effect of complete nerve section. Both methods produced similar alterations in phosphoproteins, indicating that the pattern is dependent on nerve activity, not trophic factors. Such phosphoproteins are possible mediators of neural activity on gene expression.\r"

Mapping of the CMAP latencies and amplitudes was made as the coil was displaced laterally in steps of 1 cm and in planes 0-3 cm from the skin surface. Stimulation with the coil center positioned 3 cm laterally to the nerve with the coil current directed proximally yielded the largest amplitudes with minimal variability and the most constant relationship to electrically evoked CMAPs. In this position the interindividual and intraindividual reproducibility of the magnetically evoked latencies were at least as good as those of electric stimulation when coil-skin distance was less than or equal to 2 cm.\r"

When each muscle was considered as a whole, intrinsic AChE activity detected within the fibers was stronger in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus than in the slow-twitch soleus. Analysis of individual muscle fibers also showed the same tendency with a higher value in the fast-twitch type II fibers than in the slow-twitch type I fibers. On the average, 73% of the fibers showed intermediate or strong enzymatic activity in the fast-twitch muscle, whereas 56% of the slow-twitch muscle had only low activity. Sectioning or ligation of the sciatic nerve resulted in nearly complete abolition of the enzyme in the non-endplate region of the denervated muscles within 7 days, suggesting that nerve transmission regulates AChE activity not only in the endplate, as is well known, but also outside this region. Human skeletal muscles showed the same pattern of AChE activity in the non-endplate region as seen in rat muscles.\r"

However, the reported twitch tensions may have been biased by the voluntary firing frequency of the SMUs, the complex architecture of the muscle, and by the biomechanical linkage of the jaw. In this study, a rigid STA paradigm was used to record spike-triggered \"measured tensions\" (STMTs) for 32 SMUs in the masseter muscles of four subjects. STMTs were recorded at two different orientations of a force transducer placed between the incisor teeth. The STMTs produced by each unit were used to calculate jaw torque. STMTs were also recorded in 11 units with differing degrees of muscle coactivation. STMTs for each unit varied according to the orientation of the force transducer. However, no systematic changes in STMTs occurred with reciprocal changes in the jaw moment arm. STMTs could be altered significantly by different degrees of muscle co-activation. The use of STA as a method for determining SMU tension in the human masseter muscle appears to be highly task-dependent and in the presence of co-activation may be inappropriate.\r"

While she was weak, 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise, suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade. After her strength returned, repetitive stimulation was normal, but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking. Her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elevated. Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis, it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease. Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission.\r"

Biochemical tests showed that the regenerating muscle produces globular AChE forms (36% of controls) and small amounts of A12 (16S) asymmetric form (5% of controls); at the end of the regeneration, innervation and electromechanical function are required for the complete recovery of globular forms, and are absolutely critical to prevent A12 (16S) disappearance. Cytochemical observations showed that, unlike nicotinic receptor, AChE deposited at the neuromuscular junction before ischemic necrosis is protected from breakdown, as is the basal lamina of muscle fibers. Taken together, these observations contribute to the understanding of the factors that play a critical role in muscle repair and are, therefore, of clinical relevance.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of an elevated creatine kinase (CK) in a group of polio patients with delayed weakness (15/29) did not differ from polio patients without delayed weakness (9/31) or others with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; 10/21). Mean CK in polio patients without delayed weakness (151 IU/L) was lower than the CK in those with delayed weakness (270 IU/L) or ALS (224 IU/L) (P less than 0.05). An elevated CK in polio patients with delayed weakness did not correlate with new or residual weakness. These findings suggest that muscle overuse is either not important or inadequately measured by CK. Widely distributed fibrillations were associated with an elevated CK for all polio patients combined (P less than 0.01). Fibrillations occurred in more muscles of polio patients with delayed weakness (P less than 0.01) and implies that late denervation may play a role in the development of new weakness in some polio patients.\r"

We report a model of the disease developed by active immunization of rats with purely cholinergic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from the Torpedo electric organ. Electromyographic studies of neuromuscular transmission in these rats showed a weak initial response followed by a pronounced incremental response to paired supramaximal stimuli (8 msec apart). There was no such response in control rats. There was no evidence of a postsynaptic transmission deficit in the synaptosomes immunized rats. We conclude that immunizing rats with Torpedo cholinergic nerve terminals causes a specific presynaptic dysfunction and may serve as a model for the study of LEMS.\r"

The arm is represented as a homogeneous, cylindrical volume conductor. The electric field arises from two sources: the time-varying magnetic field and the accumulation of charge on the arm surface. In magnetic stimulation both of these contributions are significant. The magnitude of the electric field is greatest near the surface of the arm, and is well localized. Various coil orientations are examined; the smallest electric fields are induced when the coil is perpendicular to the arm surface, the largest when the coil is parallel. These results are consistent with many experimental observations in the literature, and aid in the basic understanding of magnetic stimulation of the peripheral nervous system.\r"

The object of this electrophysiologic study was to determine whether the observed ultrastructural abnormalities at the mdx neuromuscular junction are associated with an abnormality of neuromuscular transmission. In comparison with age-matched control mice, the mdx mice show an abnormal, age-dependent decrease of the amplitude of the miniature end-plate potential and a concomitant increase in the quantal content of the end-plate potential. Consequently, the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is not impaired.\r"

We describe an automated technique for reliably determining the recovery cycle of human sensory nerve fibers by delivering series of paired stimuli and precisely measuring the latencies (to within 0.5 microseconds) of the compound action potentials. The recovery cycle can be compiled from the differences in latency between the two responses of a pair. Consistent changes in conduction velocity are demonstrated during each phase of altered excitability. Possible physiological mechanisms underlying the recovery cycle are discussed, and the effects of cold, ischemia, prior tetanization and subcutaneous lidocaine are presented. This technique may prove to be a useful and more sensitive tool for the study of certain disorders of peripheral nerves.\r"

Primary infection with the varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox, followed by latency, and subsequent reactivation leading to shingles (zoster), but the frequency and distribution of latent virus have not been established. METHODS. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we performed postmortem examinations of trigeminal and thoracic ganglia of 23 subjects 33 to 88 years old who had not recently had chickenpox or shingles to identify the presence of latent varicella-zoster viral DNA. Oligonucleotide primers representing the origin of replication of the varicella-zoster virus and varicella-zoster virus gene 29 were used for amplification. RESULTS. Among the 22 subjects seropositive for the antibody to the virus, both the viral origin-of-replication and gene-29 sequences were detected in 13 of 15 subjects (87 percent) in whom trigeminal ganglia were examined and in 9 of 17 (53 percent) in whom thoracic ganglia were examined. Viral DNA was not detected in brain or mononuclear cells from the seropositive subjects. None of three thoracic ganglia from the one seronegative subject contained varicella-zoster viral DNA. CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate that after primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (varicella), the virus becomes latent in many ganglia--more often in the trigeminal ganglia than in any thoracic ganglion--and that more than one region of the viral genome is present during latency.\r"

  ".U": "90348726\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. The relation between passive smoking and lung cancer is of great public health importance. Some previous studies have suggested that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the household can cause lung cancer, but others have found no effect. Smoking by the spouse has been the most commonly used measure of this exposure. METHODS. In order to determine whether lung cancer is associated with exposure to tobacco smoke within the household, we conducted a population-based case--control study of 191 patients with histologically confirmed primary lung cancer who had never smoked and an equal number of persons without lung cancer who had never smoked. Lifetime residential histories including information on exposure to environmental tobacco smoke were compiled and analyzed. Exposure was measured in terms of \"smoker-years,\" determined by multiplying the number of years in each residence by the number of smokers in the household. RESULTS. Household exposure to 25 or more smoker-years during childhood and adolescence doubled the risk of lung cancer (odds ratio, 2.07; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.68). Approximately 15 percent of the control subjects who had never smoked reported this level of exposure. Household exposure of less than 25 smoker-years during childhood and adolescence did not increase the risk of lung cancer. Exposure to a spouse's smoking, which constituted less than one third of total household exposure on average, was not associated with an increase in risk. CONCLUSIONS. The possibility of recall bias and other methodologic problems may influence the results of case-control studies of environmental tobacco smoke. Nonetheless, our findings regarding exposure during early life suggest that approximately 17 percent of lung cancers among nonsmokers can be attributed to high levels of exposure to cigarette smoke during childhood and adolescence.\r"

The ATPase fragment has two structural lobes with a deep cleft between them; ATP binds at the base of the cleft. Surprisingly, the nucleotide-binding 'core' of the ATPase fragment has a tertiary structure similar to that of hexokinase, although the remainder of the structures of the two proteins are completely dissimilar, suggesting that both the phosphotransferase mechanism and the substrate-induced conformational change intrinsic to the hexokinases may be used by the 70K heat shock-related proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90348964\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by membrane depolarization triggers a variety of key cellular responses, such as contraction in heart and smooth muscle and exocytotic secretion in endocrine and nerve cells. Modulation of calcium channel gating is believed to be the mechanism by which several neurotransmitters, hormones and therapeutic agents mediate their effects on cell function. Here we describe a novel type of voltage-dependent equilibrium between different gating patterns of dihydropyridine-sensitive (L-type) cardiac Ca2+ channels. Strong depolarizations drive the channel from its normal gating pattern into a mode of gating characterized by long openings and high open probability. The rate constants for conversions between gating modes, estimated from single channel recordings, are much slower than normal channel opening and closing rates, but the equilibrium between modes is almost as steeply voltage-dependent as channel activation and deactivation at more negative potentials. This new mechanism of voltage-dependent gating can explain previous reports of activity-dependent Ca2+ channel potentiation in cardiac and other cells and forms a potent mechanism by which Ca2+ uptake into cells could be regulated.\r"

  ".U": "90348966\r", 
  ".W": "Transducin, composed of subunits T alpha, T beta and T gamma, is a member of a heterotrimeric G-protein family, and transduces the light signal in visual cells. We have recently found that bovine T beta gamma can be separated into two components. T beta gamma-1 and T beta gamma-2, each of which has its own gamma-subunit, T gamma-1 and T gamma-2, respectively. T beta gamma-2 enhances the binding of GTP to T alpha in the presence of metarhodopsin II by about 30-fold compared with T beta gamma-1. Here we show that a farnesyl moiety is attached to a sulphur atom of the C-terminal cysteine of T gamma-2 (active form), a part of which is additionally methyl-esterified at the alpha-carboxyl group. In T gamma-1 (inactive form), however, such modifications are missing. Thus, the farnesyl moiety attached to the gamma-subunit is indispensable for the GTP-binding activity of transducin. This suggests that a similar modification may occur in the gamma-subunits of other heterotrimeric G proteins involved in biological signal transduction processes.\r"

  ".U": "90348967\r", 
  ".W": "The torso (tor) gene, one of six identified maternal genes essential for the development of the anterior and posterior terminal structures in the Drosophila embryo, is likely to function as a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. Although tor protein is uniformly distributed in the membrane of the egg cell and syncytial embryo, genetic and molecular data suggest that tor is locally activated at the ends of the embryo by a ligand present in the perivitelline space. Local activation of tor could be achieved if the ligand were expressed by a subpopulation of the follicle cells that surround the developing oocyte. Here we describe torso-like (tsl), the sixth member of the terminal gene class, and show that it is unique among these genes in that its expression is required in the somatic follicle cells rather than in the germ line. Moreover, mosaic analysis demonstrates that tsl expression is necessary only in subpopulations of follicle cells located at the poles of the oocyte. Thus, the spatially regulated expression of tsl in the follicle cell layer may generate a localized signal that is transduced by tor, ultimately resulting in the formation of the terminal structures of the embryo.\r"

  ".W": "The human muscle determination factor myf5, like MyoD and other members of the family of skeletal muscle-specific regulatory proteins, contains a highly conserved putative helix-loop-helix domain. In MyoD this motif is required for the initiation of myogenesis in C3H mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts and other non-muscle cells as well as for transcriptional activation of muscle genes. High affinity DNA binding of MyoD to regulatory DNA elements in muscle genes requires the formation of heterodimers with ubiquitous helix-loop-helix proteins such as E12 or E47. To investigate the potential of myf5 as a transcription factor, we have fused the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to various parts of the myf5 protein and analysed the transactivation of a GAL4 reporter plasmid. Here we report that myf5 contains an intrinsic transcriptional activation domain which is distinct from the helix-loop-helix motif. The predominant transactivating effect is associated with the C-terminal half of the myf5 molecule. High-affinity sequence-specific DNA binding of myf5 also requires hetero-oligomeric association with the enhancer-binding protein E12 to confer muscle-specific transactivation.\r"

  ".W": "Hairpin loops are important structural elements of RNA, helping to define the three-dimensional structure of large RNAs and providing potential nucleation sites for RNA folding and interaction with other nucleic acids and proteins. Little, however, is known about the conformation of RNA hairpins, most of what we know coming from transfer RNA crystal structures and from studies of DNA hairpins. We report here the determination of the structure of a very stable and common RNA hairpin, 5'GGAC(UUCG)GUCC (loop nucleotides in parenthesis), by NMR spectroscopy. The sequence C(UUCG)G occurs very often in RNA and may be a nucleation site for RNA folding and a protein-binding site. A high-resolution structure for the hairpin was derived from interproton distances and scalar coupling constants determined by NMR. The loop is stabilized by a G.U base pair, with guanine in the syn conformation, a cytosine-phosphate contact and extensive base stacking. These findings and other structural features of the loop can explain the unusual stability of the hairpin and suggest why reverse transcriptase cannot read through the loop, although it can transcribe through other kinds of RNA secondary structure.\r"

Epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiographic imaging, therapy, and outcome were examined and compared with previous series. An increasing incidence of the disease (up to 1.96 patients per 10,000 admissions per year) and an older, more debilitated population (67% having factors predisposing them to infection) were discovered. Over half of the population was studied with magnetic resonance imaging, which was found to be equally as sensitive (91%) as myelography with computed tomography (92%). Magnetic resonance imaging offers the advantages of being noninvasive and able to delineate other entities, which makes it the imaging modality of choice. Preoperative paralysis and neurological deterioration from normal were identified as poor prognostic features. Of 7 patients with preoperative paralysis, 5 died, and the rest failed to recover neurological function. Eleven patients with initially normal neurological exams deteriorated in the hospital before surgical intervention. Eight of these patients were being treated with appropriate antibiotics; 2 became paralyzed despite more than 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Only 3 of these 11 patients recovered fully. Immediate surgical decompression combined with antibiotics remains the treatment of choice.\r"

All cases of SEA seen by our service from August 1975 to July 1989 were reviewed retrospectively, and 29 patients were identified (19 men and 10 women, aged 13-78 years). Abscesses were located in the lumbar (n = 21), thoracic (n = 7), and cervical (n = 1) epidural spaces. Gram-positive organisms were the infectious agent in 72% of the cases, and Staphylococcus aureus was the sole agent in 45%; other agents were Gram-negative aerobes (n = 5), a Gram-negative anaerobe (n = 1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 1), and Sporotrichum schenckii (n = 1), the last occurring in a young woman with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Seventeen patients had concomitant extraspinal infections. Diagnosis was confirmed by myelography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent operative decompression and debridement; 2 required a second procedure for persistent infection. The most common operative findings were pus and granulation tissue in the epidural space (52%); the preoperative course correlated poorly with operative findings. The wound was closed primarily in 84% of cases. Postoperative intravenous antibiotic courses for the bacterial abscesses ranged from 1.5 to 6 weeks (median, 2 weeks), followed by antibiotics given orally for 0 to 6 weeks. Two patients died perioperatively. Neurological outcome was good in 21 patients and fair in 6 (mean follow-up, 1.4 years). Over the last 50 years the spectrum of organisms causing SEA has broadened, and the distinction between acute and chronic SEAs has minimal clinical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The time to recurrence was 1, 2, 2, and 35 years, respectively. The other 8 children remain free of symptoms, with follow-up ranging from 6 months to 35 years (mean, 8.8 years). In 3 of 8 patients who underwent biopsy or subtotal resection, the tumor recurred, and 2 patients died, whereas there was one recurrence in the patients in whom a \"total\" resection had been obtained. The histologically well-differentiated nature of the lesions correlated well with the relatively prolonged clinical course seen in this series during the period of observation. The relatively long clinical courses seen in our limited series should be considered before high-risk therapy for spinal cord astrocytomas in children is implemented. The presence of four pilocytic astrocytomas in this group was of special interest, and it seems likely that these discrete neoplasms can be distinguished from the more infiltrating fibrillary astrocytic neoplasms by magnetic resonance imaging with enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine.\r"

  ".W": "Meningiomas and neurofibromas are the most common intradural extramedullary tumors of the foramen magnum and cervical spine. Many of these tumors are located ventral or ventrolateral to the spinal cord and medulla. Posterior approaches, although adequate for the management of most of these tumors, can sometimes result in incomplete removal of the tumor and exacerbation of the neurological deficits. Although the transoral and transcervical approaches provide a direct route to the tumor, the exposure of the lateral margins in the case of large tumors is inadequate. In addition, because of the removal of vertebral bodies, subsequent fusion may be necessary. In the present report, an extreme lateral approach to the foramen magnum and cervical spine for the removal of intradural tumors is described. The approach provides a lateral exposure of the tumor-cord/stem interface, thus permitting safe dissection without retraction of the cord. The entire longitudinal and lateral extent of the tumor and also its extradural extension can be can be managed by this approach. This approach can be considered in such a group of patients harboring entirely ventral or recurrent tumors for which the conventional posterior approach has failed. Six patients who underwent this procedure are described to illustrate its application.\r"

These symptoms lasted longer than 24 hours and included visual changes in four patients, headache in five, and seizures, endocrine dysfunction, and oculomotor palsy in one each. Estimates of the ages of the hemorrhages were also possible based on characteristics on the MRI scan and ranged from 48 hours to more than 14 days. Four of our seven patients underwent transsphenoidal decompression at which time the presence of intratumoral hemorrhage was confirmed. The remaining three patients have been followed as outpatients with serial MRI examinations and have shown improvement in clinical symptoms and stabilization of the radiological picture. From our series of patients, it is now apparent that the MRI scan is an invaluable tool in identifying this subacute form of intra-adenomatous pituitary hemorrhage and has proven especially useful as a means of therapeutic planning and follow-up care in patients presenting with symptoms not typical of classic pituitary apoplexy.\r"

Seventeen of the tumors grew mainly in the lateral and third ventricles, and the other 2 grew both into the lateral ventricle and the cerebral parenchyma. The direction of cellular differentiation of the tumor cells varied from patient to patient and consisted of 8 neurocytomas, 1 mature neuronal tumor with ganglionic and small round neuronal cells, 3 subependymomas, 3 subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, 2 pilocytic astrocytomas, 1 malignant astrocytoma, and 1 teratoma with embryonal carcinoma. These tumors were considered to have arisen from the multipotential cells in the subependymal plate or germ cell rests in the lateral ventricular wall, especially in the septum pellucidum. Because of the relatively inert biological behavior and histological features of most of these tumors, we favor the malformative theory of their origin. Either total or an extensive excision of the tumors in this series, which had developed mainly in the ventricular system, provided long-term survival in many cases.\r"

In Group 2, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded through a transorbital approach. A combination of the two was employed in Group 3. Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectra were obtained serially during 2 hours of ischemia. Immediately after occlusion, peaks of phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate decreased, whereas the peak of inorganic phosphate increased and split in two. Intracellular pH determined by chemical shift of the inorganic phosphate peak decreased. These changes were more pronounced in Group 3 when compared with the other groups. Histological study showed no infarction in Group 1 and infarcted areas in Groups 2 and 3. The size of the infarcted area in Group 3 was larger than that in Group 2. These results suggest that the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion potentiated with the occlusion of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left subclavian artery by balloon catheters is a reliable stroke model and that phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy is useful to understand the pathophysiological state of cerebral ischemia in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The role of blood components in cerebral vasospasm was evaluated using an in vivo canine model. An intracisternal injection of 5 ml of washed red blood cells (RBCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) resulted in acute vasospasm of the basilar artery as seen by angiography. This was comparable with the degree of vasospasm induced by an injection of the same amount of whole blood. Repeated injections of blood components or whole blood on Days 1 and 3 induced chronic vasospasm, as shown by angiography on Day 7. Results clearly indicate that chronic vasospasm was produced by RBCs and PRP, and it was in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of RBCs (hematocrit: 30, 50, and 70%). The vasospasm induced by both components closely reproduced that seen with whole blood. Neither acute nor chronic vasospasm induced by blood component injection was associated with clot formation in the subarachnoid space, as confirmed by an autopsy. These results suggest that the extravasation of RBCs and PRP into the subarachnoid space produces cerebral vasospasm by mechanisms independent of blood clot formation.\r"

Cerebral pial arterial reactivities were measured by means of intravital microscopic observation through a cranial window. The middle cerebral artery of the cat was clipped for 1 hour using the transorbital approach, 5 hours later Evans blue dye was injected intravenously, and 30 minutes later the animals was killed. Administration of hydroxyethyl starch or saline was started 15 minutes before clipping and lasted for 1 hour. Total volume administered was 10 ml/kg. Systemic arterial pressure was elevated to about 30 to 40% higher than the resting value by administration of dopamine soon after clipping and maintained for 1 hour. In the hydroxyethyl starch-treated groups, the sizes of infarctions and Evans blue dye leakage were significantly smaller than in the control group. Dye leakage in the 10% HAES group was larger than in the 6% HAES group (statistically significant). Regarding pial arterial reactivities, the caliber of arteries was different in each group after reopening of the clip. Arteries in the control group first returned to some 20% of resting state and redilated 40% or more, arteries in the 6% HAES group returned almost to the resting calibers, and arteries in the 10% HAES group constricted by -20% of the resting calibers. Moreover, 8 of 10 cats in the 10% HAES group showed extravasation of red cells. Only one cat in the 6% HAES group showed extravasation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Localization and characterization of endothelin receptors in surgical specimens of human gliomas (6 benign astrocytomas and 7 glioblastomas multiforme) and in normal human cortices were studied using quantitative receptor autoradiographic methods. Low numbers of [125I]endothelin-1 [( 125I]ET-1) binding sites were detected in the gray matter of the human frontal cortex, with little binding in the white matter. Conversely, relatively high numbers of [125I]ET-1 binding sites were homogeneously present in tissue sections derived from astrocytomas, whereas higher numbers of [125I]ET-1 binding sites were heterogeneously located on groups of cells with a pseudopalisading appearance and pleomorphic astrocytes in glioblastoma multiforme. Necrotic areas within the tissue sections derived from glioblastoma were devoid of binding. Binding of [125I]ET-1 to gliomas and normal gray matter was specific. Unlabeled ET-1 and its natural analogs (ET-2 and ET-3) inhibited the binding of [125I]ET-1 to these lesions in a concentration-dependent manner and with similar high potencies. Possibly related substances, such as ion channel regulators (omega-conotoxin, apamin, and tetrodotoxin), a Ca2+ channel blocker (nicardipine), and growth factors (epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I), did not affect the binding to tissue sections derived from gliomas or from normal frontal cortices. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of a single class and high-affinity binding sites for endothelin in normal cortex and in gliomas. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities: dissociation constants (Kd) were 2.1 +/- 0.5 nM in 6 astrocytomas, 2.5 +/- 0.4 nM in 7 glioblastomas, and 1.4 and 1.5 nM in two normal cortices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Vertebral angiography showed a giant intracranial varix caused by an arteriovenous fistula that originated at the apex of the basilar artery. At operation, an aneurysm clip was placed at the origin of the fistula, and occlusion of the fistula was confirmed by intraoperative digital subtraction angiography. There were no permanent neurological sequelae. Despite shrinkage of the varix, demonstrated by follow-up computed tomography, growth hormone deficiency persisted postoperatively.

  ".W": "In vitro studies were performed to assess the ability of hepatic homogenates, mitochondria, and microsomes to 1 alpha-hydroxylate 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]. Addition of 25(OH)D3 to either hepatic mitochondria or microsomes caused a concentration-dependent increase in the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. Hepatic homogenates also produced purported 1,25(OH)2D3, although at a much reduced efficiency as compared with hepatic mitochondria or microsomes. Purported 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesized by hepatic mitochondria or microsomes was identified by its mobility on several high-performance liquid chromatographic systems and, ultimately, by its ability to interact with the bovine thymus 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein. Production of 1,25(OH)2D3 by hepatic mitochondria and microsomes was dependent on time of incubation, protein content, and pH of incubation medium, and it required an adequate source of reducing equivalents. Generation of 1,25(OH)2D3 by these organelles could be totally blocked by the cytochrome P-450 inhibitor ketoconazole. The microsomal 1 alpha-hydroxylase could not be saturated even at the highest concentration (240 microM) of 25(OH)D3 used. The mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase, however, displayed saturation at approximately 40 microM 25(OH)D3. Eadie-Hofstee reciprocal plot analysis of the hepatic mitochondrial 1 alpha-hydroxylase gave a Km of 17 microM 25(OH)D3 and a Vmax of 481 pg of 1,25(OH)2D3 per min per mg of protein. Because of its inability to achieve substrate saturation, meaningful kinetic parameters could not be calculated for the hepatic microsomal 1 alpha-hydroxylase. These data demonstrate the liver to be an even more dynamic organ than was previously believed with respect to vitamin D metabolism in that the liver has the potential to produce 1,25(OH)2D3 in situ by at least two separate mechanisms.\r"

The genes that code for at least two of the zona proteins (ZP2 and ZP3) cross-hybridize with other mammalian DNA. The recently characterized mouse sperm receptor gene (Zp-3) was used to isolate its human homolog. The human homolog spans approximately 18.3 kilobase pairs (kbp) (compared to 8.6 kbp for the mouse gene) and contains eight exons, the sizes of which are strictly conserved between the two species. Four short (8-15 bp) sequences within the first 250 bp of the 5' flanking region in the human Zp-3 homolog are also present upstream of mouse Zp-3. These elements may modulate oocyte-specific gene expression. By using the polymerase chain reaction, a full-length cDNA of human ZP3 was isolated from human ovarian poly(A)+ RNA and used to deduce the structure of human ZP3 mRNA. Certain features of the human and mouse ZP3 transcripts are conserved. Both have unusually short 5' and 3' untranslated regions, both contain a single open reading frame that is 74% identical, and both code for 424 amino acid polypeptides that are 67% the same. The similarity between the two proteins may define domains that are important in maintaining the structural integrity of the zona pellucida, while the differences may play a role in mediating the species-specific events of mammalian fertilization.\r"

  ".W": "CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) is a key regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in higher eukaryotes. This enzyme can interconvert between an inactive cytosolic form and an active membrane-bound form. To unravel the structure of the transferase and the mechanism of its interaction with membranes, we have cloned a cytidylyltransferase cDNA from rat liver by the oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction. Transfection of the rat clone into COS cells resulted in a 10-fold increase in cytidylyltransferase activity and content. The activity of the transfected transferase was lipid-dependent. The central portion of the derived protein sequence of the rat clone is highly homologous to the previously determined yeast cytidylyltransferase sequence [Tsukagoshi, Y., Nikawa, J. & Yamashita, S. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 169, 477-486]. The rat protein sequence lacks any signals for covalent lipid attachment and lacks a hydrophobic domain long enough to span a bilayer. However, it does contain a potential 58-residue amphipathic alpha-helix, encompassing three homologous 11-residue repeats. We propose that the interaction of cytidylyltransferase with membranes is mediated by this amphipathic helix lying on the surface with its axis parallel to the plane of the membrane such that its hydrophobic residues intercalate the phospholipids.\r"

  ".W": "Xeroderma pigmentosum cells, which are deficient in the repair of UV light-induced DNA damage, have been used to clone DNA-damage-inducible transcripts in human cells. The cDNA clone designated pC-5 hybridizes on RNA gel blots to a 1-kilobase transcript, which is moderately abundant in nontreated cells and whose synthesis is enhanced in human cells following UV irradiation or treatment with several other DNA-damaging agents. UV-enhanced transcription of C-5 RNA is transient and occurs at lower fluences and to a greater extent in DNA-repair-deficient than in DNA-repair-proficient cells. Southern blot analysis indicates that the C-5 gene belongs to a multigene family. A cDNA clone containing the complete coding sequence of C-5 was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that it is homologous to a human cellular sequence encoding the amino-terminal activating sequence of the trk-2h chimeric oncogene [Kozma, S. C., Redmond, S. M. S., Xiao-Chang, F., Saurer, S. M., Groner, B. & Hynes, N. E. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 147-154]. The presence of DNA-damage-responsive sequences at the 5' end of a chimeric oncogene could result in enhanced expression of the oncogene in response to carcinogens.\r"

Biotinylated tubulin incorporated into the meiotic spindle to apparent equilibrium within 15 min. To assess quantitatively the rates of disassembly and assembly of the microtubules, small domains within the spindles of oocytes injected with x-rhodamine-tubulin were photobleached and their recovery was analyzed by digital imaging microscopy. Fluorescence recovery in the spindles was rapid and extensive, plateauing to an average of 83% at 4 min. The calculated half-time for turnover of the spindle microtubules was 77 sec. In contrast, fluorescence recovery of the spindle midbodies in telophase oocytes was much more limited, averaging approximately 22% at 4 min. These data indicate that most microtubules within the arrested metaphase spindle of the mouse oocyte undergo rapid cycles of assembly and disassembly.

  ".U": "90349554\r", 
  ".W": "CD4+ T cells of patients with AIDS exhibit a qualitative defect in their ability to respond to soluble antigen while their responses to mitogens remain normal. CD4+ T cells can be broadly divided phenotypically into \"naive\" [CD45RA+ (2H4+)] and \"memory\" [CD29+ (4B4+) or CD45RO+ (UCHL1+)] cell subpopulations, which represent distinct maturation stages. To determine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectability of memory and naive CD4+ T-cell subsets in vitro and to determine the in vivo preference of HIV-1 in these subpopulations, we obtained highly purified CD4+ T-cell subsets from normal and HIV-1-infected individuals and studied them by viral cultivation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays. Polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that the memory cell subset of CD4+ T cells is preferentially infected (4- to 10-fold more than naive T cells) by HIV-1 in vitro, and these memory cells are the principal reservoir for HIV-1 within CD4+ T cells obtained from infected individuals. Functional abnormalities attributable to CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals (failure to respond in vitro to soluble antigen or to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies) were shown to reside primarily within these memory cells. Thus, the present study suggests that the selective functional defects present in the memory CD4+ T-cell subset of HIV-infected individuals may be a direct result of the preferential infection and consequently greater viral burden within these cells.\r"

Change in serotype-specific variable outer membrane proteins (Vmps) occurs when a Vmp gene at an expression site is replaced with a previously silent gene for another Vmp. Silent and active genes are on separate linear plasmids. The upstream site for a nonreciprocal recombination between two linear plasmids is near the 5' ends of the expressed and silent genes. In the present study we sought the downstream recombination sites in two serotypes, 7 and 21. Restriction fragments containing plasmid telomeres were identified by susceptibility to digestion with BAL-31 and rapid reannealment following denaturation. Whereas both silent genes and a minority population of both expression-linked genes were several kilobases from the telomeres, the predominant population of both expressed genes had 3' ends near plasmid telomeres. Sequence analysis of the predominant expression plasmids revealed that the telomeric sequences were the same in serotypes 7 and 21. Identical sequence was also downstream of silent Vmp genes. Switching of Vmp genes appears to occur by recombination that involves both upstream and downstream sites. The expression plasmid's telomere is preserved in the recombination event.\r"

A comparison of T. vaginalis ferredoxin with greater than 80 other ferredoxins shows the closest similarity to [2Fe-2S]putidaredoxin of the aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas putida and a lesser one to mitochondrial [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins of vertebrates. This similarity is reflected in the overall primary structure and in the spacing of cysteine residues coordinating the iron-sulfur center. The primary structure, but not the environment of the iron-sulfur center, also shows similarity with [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins of photosynthetic organisms and halobacteria. We have cloned and analyzed the T. vaginalis ferredoxin gene. The gene is present in a single copy and devoid of introns. It gives rise to a transcript with unusually short 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 16 and 18 nucleotides, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the gene predicts an additional 8 amino acids at the amino terminus which are absent from the purified protein. This amino-terminal region of the protein is characterized by properties typical of mitochondrial presequences.\r"

An assay for this protein kinase activity present in homogenates prepared from A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells was developed using a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to residues 663-681 of the EGF receptor (peptide T669). Here we report that a greater initial rate of T669 phosphorylation was observed in experiments using homogenates prepared from EGF- or phorbol ester-treated cells compared with control cells. EGF and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused a 6-fold and a 2-fold increase in protein kinase activity, respectively. A kinetic analysis of T669 phosphorylation demonstrated that the increase in protein kinase activity observed was accounted for by an increase in Vmax. To examine the interaction between protein kinase C and signal transduction by the EGF receptor, the effect of pretreatment of cells with PMA on the subsequent response to EGF was investigated. Treatment of cells with PMA caused greater than 90% inhibition of the EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and abolished the EGF-stimulated formation of soluble inositol phosphates. In contrast, PMA was not observed to inhibit the stimulation of T669 protein kinase activity caused by EGF. Thus, the apparent functional desensitization of the EGF receptor caused by PMA does not inhibit signal transduction mediated by the T669 protein kinase. Our results demonstrate that EGF receptor transmodulation alters the pattern of signal-transduction pathways that are utilized by the EGF receptor.\r"

We used Hpa II/Msp I analysis and ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction to examine the methylation of the MyoD1 CpG island in adult mouse tissues, early cultures of mouse embryo cells, and immortal fibroblastic cell lines. The island was almost devoid of methylation at CCGG sites in adult mouse tissues and in low-passage mouse embryo fibroblasts. In marked contrast, the island was methylated in 10T 1/2 cells and in six other immortal cell lines showing that methylation of this CpG island had occurred during escape from senescence. The island became even more methylated in chemically transformed derivatives of 10T 1/2 cells. Thus, CpG islands not methylated in normal tissues may become modified to an abnormally high degree during immortalization and transformation.\r"

Lack of surfactant at birth is associated with respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a highly hydrophobic peptide isolated from pulmonary tissue that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipids. Like surfactant phospholipid, SP-C is produced by epithelial cells in the distal respiratory epithelium, and its expression increases during the latter part of gestation. A chimeric gene containing 3.6 kilobases of the promoter and 5'-flanking sequences of the human SP-C gene was used to express diphtheria toxin A. The SP-C-diphtheria toxin A fusion gene was injected into fertilized mouse eggs to produce transgenic mice. Affected mice developed respiratory failure in the immediate postnatal period. Morphologic analysis of lungs from affected pups showed variable but severe cellular injury confined to pulmonary tissues. Ultrastructural changes consistent with cell death and injury were prominent in the distal respiratory epithelium. Proximal components of the tracheobronchial tree were not severely affected. Transgenic animals were of normal size at birth, and structural abnormalities were not detected in nonpulmonary tissues. Lung-specific diphtheria toxin A expression controlled by the human SP-C gene injured type II epithelial cells and caused extensive necrosis of the distal respiratory epithelium. The absence of type I epithelial cells in the most severely affected transgenic animals supports the concept that developing type II cells serve as precursors to type I epithelial cells.\r"

Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences (each nearly 2.7 kilobase pairs in length) supports a cervine/muntiacine clade to the exclusion of odocoileines. These results are statistically significant, stable, and congruent with some independent data. Our mitochondrial DNA sequences, when coupled with other information, indicate that the earliest fossil antlered deer are not closely related to living muntiacines or any other contemporary subfamily. From this information, we hypothesize an Old World, Late Miocene origin of Odocoileinae.\r"

In all the volunteers, three 50-micrograms injections of Env 2-3 induced priming of CD4+ T cells specific for conserved regions of the native glycosylated gp120. Moreover, we found that several major histocompatibility complex class II (DR) alleles can function as restriction molecules for presentation of conserved epitopes of gp120 to T cells, implying that a T-cell response to these epitopes can be obtained in a large fraction of the population. The possibility to prime CD4+ T cells specific for conserved epitopes of a HIV protein is particularly important in view of the lack of such cells in HIV-infected individuals and of a possible role that CD4+ T cells may play in the development of protective immunity against AIDS.\r"

We report the construction of an N2-based recombinant retroviral vector, NCMVFIX, for efficient transfer and expression of human factor IX cDNA in primary rabbit hepatocytes. In this construct the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter directs the expression of factor IX. Hepatocytes were isolated from 3-week-old New Zealand White rabbits, infected with the recombinant virus, and analyzed for secretion of active factor IX. The infected rabbit hepatocytes produced human factor IX that is indistinguishable from enzyme derived from normal human plasma. The recombinant protein is sufficiently gamma-carboxylated and is functionally active in clotting assays. These results establish the feasibility of using infected hepatocytes for the expression of this protein and are a step toward the goal of correcting hemophilia B by hepatic gene transfer.\r"

Tryptic digests of two separate TNFR preparations provided amino acid sequences of four different peptides. Amino-terminal analysis indicated the presence of the amino-acid sequence Val-Ala-Phe-Thr-Pro, reported to be the amino-terminal sequence of a 30-kDa urinary TNF-binding protein II. Examination of the cultured medium of UC/HeLa 2-5 cells showed an abundance of a 40-kDa TNF-binding protein, indicating that the previously cited 30-kDa TNF-binding protein II is likely to be a shed form of the TNFR. Based on the peptide sequences, oligonucleotides were synthesized, and two of these were used as primers in the polymerase chain reaction to amplify cDNA sequences from poly(A)+ RNA of UC/HeLa 2-5 cells. These PCR fragments were radiolabeled and used to screen a cDNA library made from UC/HeLa 2-5 mRNA. Further analysis identified cDNA sequences that encoded the amino acid sequences of all four TNFR peptides. RNA blot-hybridization analysis of UC/HeLa 2-5 mRNA revealed a 3.8-kilobase transcript of the same size as the mRNA in the parental UC cells. Genomic Southern blots indicated the presence of a single gene in parental cells and a second, amplified gene in TNFR-overexpressing cells, suggesting amplification of the transfected gene as a possible mechanism for the increase in TNFR numbers in UC/HeLa 2-5 cells.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies from this laboratory, the binding regions of alpha-neurotoxins on human and Torpedo acetylcholine (AcCho) receptors (AcChoRs) and the binding regions for the receptor on the toxin were characterized with synthetic peptides of the respective molecules. In the present work, peptides representing the active regions of one molecule are each allowed to bind to each of the active-region peptides of the other molecule. Thus, the interaction of three alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) synthetic loop peptides with four synthetic peptides representing the toxin-binding regions on human AcChoR permitted the determination of the region-region interactions between alpha-BTX and the human receptor. Based on the known three-dimensional structure of the toxin, the active peptides of the receptor were then assembled to their appropriate toxin-contact regions by computer model building and energy minimization. This allowed the three-dimensional construction of the toxin-binding cavity on human AcChoR. The cavity appears to be conical, 30.5 A in depth, involving several receptor regions that make contact with the alpha-BTX loop regions. One AcChoR region (within residues 125-136) involved in the binding to alpha-BTX also resides in a known AcCho-binding site, thus demonstrating in three dimensions a critical site involved in both AcCho activation and alpha-BTX blocking. The validity of this approach was first established for three of four peptides corresponding to regions on the beta chain of human hemoglobin involved in binding to the alpha chain. Thus, studying the interaction between peptides representing the binding regions of two protein molecules may provide an approach in molecular recognition by which the binding site on one protein can be described if the three-dimensional structure of the other protein is known.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously characterized mutant adenosine deaminase (ADA; adenosine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.4) enzymes in seven children with partial ADA deficiency. Six children shared common origins, suggesting a common progenitor. However, we found evidence for multiple phenotypically different mutant enzymes. We hypothesized that many of the mutations would be at CpG dinucleotides, hot spots at which spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine results in C to T or G to A transitions. Digestion of DNA from these children with Msp I and Taq I, enzymes recognizing CpG dinucleotides, identified three different mutations, each correlating with expression of a different mutant enzyme. Sequencing of cDNA clones and genomic DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of C to T or G to A transitions at CpG dinucleotides (C226 to T, G446 to A, and C821 to T, resulting in Arg76 to Trp, Arg149 to Gln, and Pro274 to Leu). A \"null\" mutation, also found in two ADA-deficient severe combined immunodeficient children, was serendipitously detected as gain of a site for Msp I. Simultaneous loss of a site for Bal I defined the precise base substitution (T320 to C, Leu107 to Pro), confirmed by sequence analysis. To determine the true frequency of hot spot mutation in these children, consecutively ascertained through a newborn screening program, we sequenced cDNA from the remaining alleles. Two others were hot spot mutations (C631 to T and G643 to A, resulting in Arg211 to Cys and Ala215 to Thr), each again resulting in expression of a phenotypically different mutant enzyme. Only one additional mutation (previously identified by us) is not in a hot spot. These seven mutations account for all 14 chromosomes in these children. There is thus a very high frequency of hot spot mutations in partial ADA deficiency. Most of these children carry two different mutant alleles. We were able to correlate genotype and phenotype and to dissect the activity of individual mutant alleles.\r"

  ".U": "90349581\r", 
  ".W": "The compartmental organization of corticostriatal projections from the fronto-orbito-insular cortex was studied in the cat. Cortical areas in this field were found to have a highly organized projection to the striatum, selectively innervating striosomes dorsally and predominantly avoiding them ventrally within their striatal fields of termination. These observations have two important implications for striatal processing. First, some cortical areas preferentially terminate in different compartments in different parts of the striatum. Therefore, the sources of input to striosomes and matrix are not categorical but switch according to the striatal region considered. Second, three properties of the bicompartmental termination pattern--one-dimensionality, common polarization, and multiple positions at which the pattern switched from \"fills\" to \"avoids\"--allowed us to order the corticostriatal projections with respect to one another. This ordering of the striatal projections of cortical areas implies an ordering of the cortical areas themselves, one that is independent of transcortical connections. For the corticostriatal projections described in this report, the ordering is [parietal, dorsomedial prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, insular, rostral temporal] cortex. Our analysis suggests that a major function of striatal compartmentalization is to segregate and then bring together inputs from cortical areas at different positions in this ordering. The ordering may also serve as a simple format for specifying corticostriatal connections in development.\r"

  ".W": "Melatonin binding sites were localized and characterized in the vasculature of the rat by using the melatonin analogue 2-[125I]iodomelatonin (125I-melatonin) and quantitative in vitro autoradiography. The expression of these sites was restricted to the caudal artery and to the arteries that form the circle of Willis at the base of the brain. The arterial 125I-melatonin binding was stable, saturable, and reversible. Saturation studies revealed that the binding represented a single class of high-affinity binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.4 x 10(-11) M in the anterior cerebral artery and 1.05 x 10(-10) M in the caudal artery. The binding capacities (Bmax) in these arteries were 19 and 15 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. The relative order of potency of indoles for inhibition of 125I-melatonin binding at these sites was typical of a melatonin receptor: 2-iodomelatonin greater than melatonin greater than N-acetylserotonin much much greater than 5-hydroxytryptamine. Norepinephrine-induced contraction of the caudal artery in vitro was significantly prolonged and potentiated by melatonin in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that these arterial binding sites are functional melatonin receptors. Neither primary steps in smooth muscle contraction (inositol phospholipid hydrolysis) nor relaxation (adenylate cyclase activation) were affected by melatonin. Melatonin, through its action on the tone of these arteries, may cause circulatory adjustments in these arteries, which are believed to be involved in thermoregulation.\r"

Properties of Lp(a) that are shared with ascorbate, in accordance with this hypothesis, are the acceleration of wound healing and other cell-repair mechanisms, the strengthening of the extracellular matrix (e.g., in blood vessels), and the prevention of lipid peroxidation. High plasma Lp(a) is associated with coronary heart disease and other forms of atherosclerosis in humans, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease is decreased by elevated ascorbate. Similar observations have been made in cancer and diabetes. We have formulated the hypothesis that Lp(a) is a surrogate for ascorbate in humans and other species and have marshaled the evidence bearing on this hypothesis.\r"

  ".W": "A number of eukaryotic viruses have evolved mechanisms to downregulate activity of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (referred to as P68 based on its Mr of 68,000 in human cells). This control is essential because once activated, the P68 kinase phosphorylates its natural substrate, the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), limiting functional eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 available for protein synthesis initiation. We have previously shown that influenza virus encoded a specific mechanism to repress the autophosphorylation and activity of P68. Using in vitro assays for P68 inhibition, we now have purified, to near homogeneity, the P68 repressor from influenza virus-infected cells. The purified product inhibited both the autophosphorylation of P68 as well as phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2 by the kinase. We tested for both protease and phosphatase activity but found neither activity associated with the purified inhibitor. Surprisingly we found the purified repressor, which had an apparent Mr of approximately 58,000, was a cellular and not a viral-encoded protein. Possible mechanisms by which influenza virus activates this cellular regulator of the protein kinase, thereby minimizing potential antiviral effects of interferon, are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed an approach for identifying overlapping cosmid clones by exploiting the high density of repetitive sequences in complex genomes. Individual clones are fingerprinted, using a combination of restriction enzyme digestions followed by hybridization with selected classes of repetitive sequences. This \"repeat fingerprinting\" technique allows small regions of clone overlap (10-20%) to be unambiguously assigned. We demonstrate the utility of this approach, using the fingerprinting of 3145 cosmid clones (1.25 x coverage), containing one or more (GT)n repeats, from human chromosome 16. A statistical analysis was used to link these clones into 460 contiguous sequences (contigs), averaging 106 kilobases (kb) in length and representing approximately 54% (48.7 Mb) of the euchromatic arms of this chromosome. These values are consistent with theoretical calculations and indicate that 150- to 200-kb contigs can be generated with 1.5 x coverage. This strategy requires the fingerprinting of approximately one-fourth as many cosmids as random strategies requiring 50% minimum overlap for overlap detection. By \"nucleating\" at specific regions in the human genome, and exploiting the high density of interspersed sequences, this approach allows (i) the rapid generation of large (greater than 100-kb) contigs in the early stages of contig mapping and (ii) the production of a contig map with useful landmarks for rapid integration of the genetic and physical maps.\r"

  ".W": "The vitamin A derivative retinoic acid is known to be a potent agent for control of differentiation and proliferation of epithelial cells and to exert profound effects on pattern formation during embryogenesis. Its action at the molecular level appears to be mediated by two distinct classes of proteins: a family of nuclear receptors that regulates gene transcription in a ligand-dependent fashion and a small cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) for which a precise function remains to be elucidated. In this report, we describe the identification (by molecular cloning of its cDNA) of an isoform of CRABP, referred to as CRABP-II, expressed at high levels during mouse embryogenesis and in adult skin. We also show that CRABP-II mRNA levels are induced by at least 50-fold upon treatment of F9 teratocarcinoma cells with retinoic acid. The up-regulation of the gene encoding CRABP-II by its ligand suggests that CRABP-II might be involved in a feedback regulatory role in the mechanism of action of retinoic acid on cellular differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The 5' splice site of a pre-mRNA is recognized by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) through base pairing with the 5' end of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Single-base substitutions within a 9-nucleotide 5'-splice-site sequence can abolish or attenuate use of that site and, in higher eukaryotes, can also activate nearby \"cryptic\" 5' splice sites. Here we show that the effects of single-base substitutions within a 5' splice site can be completely or partially suppressed by cis mutations that improve the overall complementarity of the site to U1 snRNA. We further show that in the presence of the normal 5' splice site, a cryptic 5' splice site can be activated by increasing its complementarity to U1 snRNA. U1 snRNP binding experiments confirm that cryptic 5' splice sites are activated when their affinity for U1 snRNP approaches that of the authentic 5' splice site. Based upon these results, we propose a spliceosome competition model for 5'-splice-site selection and cryptic 5'-splice-site activation. We discuss our results with regard to the factors involved in 5'-splice-site recognition.\r"

  ".U": "90349594\r", 
  ".W": "Glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya subunit gene expression is induced in mammalian tissues by two types of chemical agents: (i) planar aromatic compounds (e.g., 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin) and (ii) electrophiles (e.g., trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one and dimethyl fumarate) or compounds easily oxidized to electrophiles (e.g., tert-butylhydroquinone). To study the mechanism of this induction, we have introduced deletions in the 5' flanking region of a mouse GST Ya subunit gene, fused it to the coding sequence for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, and transfected the Ya-CAT genes for expression into hepatoma cells. We show that a single cis-regulatory element, between nucleotides -754 and -713 from the start of transcription, is responsible for the induction by both planar aromatic and electrophilic compounds. Using murine hepatoma cell mutants defective in either the Ah-encoded aryl hydrocarbon receptor (BPrc1 mutant) or in cytochrome P1-450 gene (c1 mutant), we show that induction by planar aromatic but not by electrophilic inducers requires a functional Ah receptor and cytochrome P1-450 activity. From this it is concluded that Ya gene activation by planar aromatic compounds involves metabolism of these inducers by the phase I xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochrome P1-450 system into electrophilic compounds, which is consistent with a recently proposed model [Prochaska, H. J. & Talalay, P. (1988) Cancer Res. 48, 4776-4782]. Therefore, the regulatory sequence of the Ya gene should be considered an electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) activated exclusively by inducers containing an electrophilic center. An EpRE-containing 41-bp oligonucleotide ligated at the -187 site of the Ya gene promoter confers upon it an increase in basal activity and xenobiotic inducibility. The basal activity augments with the number of EpRE copies. DNase I protection patterns show the protection of the EpRE domain by a nuclear factor(s) that becomes more abundant upon exposure of Hepa 1c1c7 cells to tert-butylhydroquinone.\r"

However, the biochemical events that lead to this induction, and their degree of similarity with pathways triggered by heat stress, have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that transient exposure of cultured C2C12 mouse myogenic cells to a hypoxic atmosphere stimulates DNA binding activity of the heat shock transcription factor through mechanisms that are independent of new protein synthesis. Activation of heat shock transcription factor in hypoxic cells is temporally associated with induction of endogenous HSP70 gene transcription and with induction of a heterologous reporter gene controlled by the human HSP70 promoter. Furthermore, induction of the human HSP70 promoter by hypoxia requires an intact heat shock element, indicating that other cis-acting transcriptional control elements contained within this complex promoter are not sufficient to transduce signals generated within hypoxic cells. These findings provide strong evidence that hypoxia and heat shock induce expression of the HSP70 gene by similar, if not identical, mechanisms.\r"

A cDNA for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor was used to assess the effect of norepinephrine on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA level in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from the rabbit aorta. Norepinephrine caused a transient decrease (81% +/- 5%; n = 9) in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA. The effect was concentration dependent (EC50, approximately 0.3 microM; maximal effect, 10 microM). The maximum decrease occurred after 4 hr of exposure to norepinephrine and was followed by a gradual return to control levels by 24 hr. The decrease in mRNA level was blocked by prazosin, but not propranolol, and was mimicked by phenylephrine. These results indicate that the effect is mediated by stimulation of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor and suggest that it involves one or more alpha 1-adrenergic-coupled second messenger pathways. The decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA caused by norepinephrine exceeds that caused by actinomycin D, suggesting that norepinephrine may cause a decrease in the stability of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA. Actinomycin D also blocked the norepinephrine-induced decrease in mRNA level, further suggesting that the effect of norepinephrine requires induction of transcription, presumably leading to synthesis of a labile factor that is necessary for the effect of norepinephrine on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA level.\r"

Here we describe a bird, the chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica), that lacks delta-crystallin/argininosuccinate lyase, usually the major crystallin of avian lenses. Clearly, delta-crystallin is not specifically required for a functionally effective avian lens. Furthermore the lens composition of the swift is more similar to that of the related hummingbirds than to that of the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), suggesting that phylogeny is more important than environmental selection in the recruitment of crystallins. However differences in epsilon-crystallin/lactate dehydrogenase-B sequence between swift and hummingbird and other avian and reptilian species suggest that selective pressures may also be working at the molecular level. These differences also confirm the close relationship between swifts and hummingbirds.\r"

Symptoms in transformed plants were less severe than in nontransformed controls when challenged with virus or cloned DNA of Kenyan or Nigerian isolates. Symptom amelioration was associated with the mobilization and amplification of the subgenomic DNA, producing a comparable reduction in the amount of DNA specific to each genomic component. The disproportionate reduction in the levels of full-length components (DNA A, 20%; DNA B, 70%) indicates that the episomally replicating subgenomic DNA has been amplified at the expense of full-length DNA B to three times the level of the latter. Serial infection of transformants resulted in a further decrease in symptom severity and viral DNA levels. No differences were observed in the severity of symptoms or levels of viral DNA when transformants and controls were challenged with the related geminiviruses beet curly top virus and tomato golden mosaic virus, demonstrating the specific nature of the interaction. Analysis of infected tissue showed that tomato golden mosaic virus was unable to amplify the subgenomic DNA. However, since the production of subgenomic DNA is possibly a common feature of the bipartite geminiviruses, this approach might contribute to the production of plants showing increased tolerance to a number of economically important viral diseases.\r"

One antibody (against the fragment from Ala-837 through Asp-851) reacted only with the intact subunit, and its epitope included the cleavage site. All others reacted specifically with either the 140-kDa or the 176-kDa fragment, demonstrating their origin from a single cleavage. In samples of purified von Willebrand factor from four of five patients with type IIA von Willebrand disease, the anti-peptide antibodies showed markedly decreased reactivity with either the 140-kDa or the 176-kDa fragment, suggesting the existence of distinct molecular abnormalities clustered around the cleavage site. Thus, in the majority of type IIA patients, a common pathogenetic mechanism may lead to the disappearance of the larger multimers as a consequence of structural changes that may expose a sensitive bond to the action of specific proteases. These studies demonstrate the use of anti-peptide antibodies directed at a relevant structural domain for the immunochemical differentiation of normal and mutant molecules.\r"

These plants were resistant to infection when challenged with either TMV U1 virions or TMV U1 RNA at concentrations of up to 500 micrograms/ml or 300 micrograms/ml, respectively, the highest concentrations tested. Resistance was also exhibited when plants were inoculated at 100 micrograms/ml with the closely related TMV mutant YSI/1 but was not shown in plants challenged at the same concentrations with the more distantly related TMV strains U2 or L or cucumber mosaic virus. Although the copy number of the 54-kDa gene sequence varied in individual transformants from 1 to approximately 5, the level of resistance in plants was not dependent on the number of copies of the 54-kDa gene sequence integrated. The transformed plants accumulated a 54-kDa gene sequence-specific RNA transcript of the expected size, but no protein product was detected.\r"

In the present study, the incorporation of selenium from 75SeO3(2-) into these macromolecules was investigated in sonic extracts of M. vannielii. Nucleoside analysis of the 75Se-labeled tRNAs from these in vitro reaction mixtures demonstrated that the selenium was present in 75Se-labeled nucleosides identical to the two naturally occurring 2-selenouridines produced in vivo. Incorporation of selenium into these nucleosides was ATP-dependent and was maximal after 20 min. Addition of O-acetylserine enhanced the activity 2- to 3-fold, implicating a role for selenocysteine in the reaction. Added L-selenocysteine could function as a selenium donor, but the D isomer and DL-selenomethionine were inactive. RPC-5 chromatography of bulk tRNA isolated from M. vannielii grown on 75SeO3(2-) separated five major species of seleno-tRNAs. The amino acid-accepting activity of these tRNAs was investigated.\r"

The purification process concentrated the protein 240-fold and to a purity of greater than 95%. An overall recovery of 45% was achieved; the purified protein had a specific activity of 104 units per mg of protein. The polypeptide had a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.0-4.5. Amino acid sequencing of the NH2 terminus revealed a single sequence (Asp-Ile-Val-Met-Thr-Gln-Ser-Pro-Gly-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ser-Pro-Gly-Glu-Arg-Ala- Thr) that proved to be nonhomologous with other serum proteins that appear during an inflammatory state. The polypeptide inhibited the uptake of deoxyglucose, chemotaxis, oxidative metabolism, and intracellular bacterial killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. A specific rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the protein nullified these inhibitory changes. We contend that the protein is responsible for the leukocyte dysfunction that is commonly seen in patients with uremia.\r"

A long-standing puzzle has, therefore, been: What forces drive the formation of the specific internal architectures in globular proteins? We find that any self-avoiding flexible polymer molecule will develop large amounts of secondary structure, helices and parallel and antiparallel sheets, as it is driven to increasing compactness by any force of attraction among the chain monomers. Thus structure formation arises from the severity of steric constraints in compact polymers. This steric principle of organization can account for why short helices are stable in globular proteins, why there are parallel and anti-parallel sheets in proteins, and why weakly unfolded proteins have some secondary structure. On this basis, it should be possible to construct copolymers, not necessarily using amino acids, that can collapse to maximum compactness in incompatible solvents and that should then have structural organization resembling that of proteins.\r"

RRM family members contain either one (class I) or multiple (class II) copies of this motif. We report here that a class II component of the U1 small nuclear RNP (snRNP), the A protein of U1 snRNP (U1snRNP-A), contains two RRMs (RRM1 and -2), yet has only one binding domain (RRM1) that interacts specifically with stem-loop II of U1 RNA. Quantitative analysis of binding affinities of fragments of U1snRNP-A demonstrated that an 86-amino acid polypeptide was competent to bind to U1 RNA with an affinity comparable to that of the full-length protein (Kd approximately 80 nM). The carboxyl-terminal RRM2 of U1snRNP-A did not bind to U1 RNA and may recognize an unidentified heterologous RNA. We propose that class II proteins may function as bridges between RNA components of RNP complexes such as the spliceosome.\r"

Inclusion of polyethylene glycol in the reassociation buffer greatly improved the in-gel reassociation efficiency, which was critical for the practical use of the procedure. Using this technique, we obtained several clones from rat brain (target) DNA, which may have been derived from tissue (brain)-specific altered DNA structures.

Previously, we reported that an 18-amino acid peptide derived from the nucleocapsid protein of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RMLV) binds metals such as Co2+ and Zn2+. We have now synthesized the entire nucleocapsid protein from RMLV. We report here that the protein also binds Co2+ and Zn2+ and does so with a higher affinity than does the peptide. Limited proteolysis and circular dichroism studies reveal that metal binding induces folding of the metal-binding domain and, perhaps, the regions adjacent to it but the remainder of the protein remains in a relatively unstructured state. In addition, we have synthesized sequence variants of the metal-binding domain that correspond to viral mutations reported in the literature. In many cases, the metal-binding properties of these peptides correlate with the observed biological activity, providing further evidence for the importance of metal binding to nucleocapsid function.\r"

Crystals composed of the entire extracellular portion of CD4 exhibit extensive polymorphism. Of the five crystal types that have been grown, the best diffracts to Bragg spacings of 4.9 A. Symmetry considerations and characterization of the asymmetric unit by volume-specific amino acid analysis lead to the suggestion that a tetramer is the fundamental unit of crystallization. The characterization also showed that several of the crystal types have unusually high solvent contents. Because high solvent content and weak diffraction are indicative of an extended flexible structure, we examined the molecular shape of the recombinant CD4 with ultracentrifugation and found that it has an axial ratio of roughly 6, when modeled as a prolate ellipsoid. These results, combined with crystal packing constraints, suggest dimensions of approximately 25 x 25 x 125 A for a monomer. The structural features deduced here may be relevant to the biological function of CD4 as a receptor mediating cell-cell and cell-virus interactions.\r"

Addition of an anti-prolactin antiserum resulted in the specific inhibition of T-cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Synthesis of prolactin and its mRNA, however, did not occur during interleukin 2 stimulation. Instead, previously internalized prolactin, presumably from fetal bovine serum, appears to serve as the source of prolactin under serum-free conditions. A 7-fold increase in a prolactin receptor occurred as a function of cell cycle progression; accumulation of a 1.6-kilobase prolactin receptor mRNA increased approximately 2-fold. Interleukin 2 stimulation induced the translocation of prolactin into the nucleus and prolactin receptor to the nuclear periphery. These data indicate that extracellular prolactin is requisite for T-cell proliferation and suggest that the effects of prolactin are exerted in the nucleus.\r"

External horizontal and vertical orbital dimensions were obtained by palpation technique weekly. All animals had preoperative and study conclusion head CT scans with three-dimensional reconstructions performed. Dry skull preparations were done at the study conclusion at 24 weeks. Results demonstrated that tissue expanders were successful in maintaining normal orbital growth and size relative to the contralateral control orbit. The animals with enucleation only had an average difference in vertical and horizontal orbital measurements of -27 and -13 percent when compared with the contralateral normal orbit. In contrast, the enucleation and tissue-expansion animals had vertical and horizontal measurements of +4 and +2 percent (p less than 0.05) when compared with the contralateral orbit. Head CT scans with three-dimensional reconstructions demonstrated normal orbital geometry and volume for the animals with tissue expanders, whereas animals with enucleation only had small hypoplastic orbits. In conclusion, orbital tissue expanders offer a promising new technique in the treatment of anophthalmos.\r"

It is incumbent upon the surgeon to inquire preoperatively about possible recreational use of cocaine. As the preferred site of cocaine administration, the nasal septal mucosa is exposed to both the intense vasoconstrictive action of cocaine and the irritative effects of numerous contaminating additives. Pathologic changes in the septal mucosa should be recognized by preoperative rhinoscopy and evaluated by biopsy. In this series of 13 patients, fewer than half were properly identified as cocaine users during the preoperative consultation. Preoperative rhinoscopic findings varied from grossly unremarkable septal mucosa to visible perforation and microscopic evidence of granulomas, inflammation, and necrosis. Surgical complications consisted of localized septal collapse, delayed mucosal healing, and inadequate correction of septal deflection. Submucous resection and septoplasty should be avoided in patients with a known history of intranasal cocaine application. Although rhinoplasty can be safely performed in selected patients with a history of cocaine use, it may be extremely limited, unfeasible, or hazardous in those with significant mucosal and cartilaginous impairment as well as in those patients who refuse or are unable to relinquish the drug.\r"

Motor vehicle accidents accounted for over half the injuries in both groups, while falls were more prevalent in the elderly. Management of the elderly patient may be complicated by their associated injuries or underlying medical problems, perhaps partially accounting for their longer median length of hospital stay.

  ".U": "90349750\r", 
  ".W": "Much attention has recently been focused on rigid fixation as a method of improving fracture healing. Whether such fixation, when applied to onlay grafting, improves graft take and volume is unknown. To examine this question, we compared survival of both endochondral and membranous grafts fixed rigidly and nonrigidly in areas of low motion (snout) and high motion (femur) in a rabbit model. Gross morphology, histologic analysis, and graft volume kinetics were evaluated. Findings demonstrate that in areas of high motion, the application of rigid fixation improves graft survival, whereas in a low-motion region, no differences in graft volume retention as a function of fixation were observed. Histologically, no differences with the method of fixation employed were seen, and similar revascularization patterns were noted. By kinetic analysis, rigid fixation appears to exert its most profound effect early in the postgraft period. Membranous bone grafts remain superior to endochondral grafts under all circumstances. From these studies, we conclude that rigid fixation is the method of choice in all circumstances where onlay bone grafts may be exposed to motion, shear, and torsional forces.\r"

  ".W": "Nine acrocephalosyndactyly type I patients (Apert's syndrome) and three acrocephalosyndactyly type V patients (Pfeiffer's syndrome) were evaluated for the relative importance of upper and lower airway abnormalities in the generation of obstructive sleep apnea. All patients were found to have a combination of upper and lower abnormalities. The influence of lower pathology was greater in the infants, and the influence of upper airway, specifically pharyngeal, was greater in the adults. A comparison between preoperative and postoperative polysomnography revealed little improvement with standard craniofacial advancements. Furthermore, three patients are described who succumbed to pulmonary death despite tracheostomy. Conservative treatment with prone or lateral positioning and medical pulmonary regimens is advocated. Finally, the pathogenesis of this diffuse airway pathology is discussed.\r"

The demand for reduction and contouring of the pomus Adamus continues to increase in our societies today. Since our first presentation of this procedure, we have been able to follow 31 patients over a 17-year period. We present a review of our technique of chondrolaryngoplasty, with anatomic details and a follow-up of 31 patients ranging from 4 months to 17 years. The results are effective and satisfying, with few complications. Those which do occur tend to be transient, with the most frequent being a temporary mild voice weakness. We believe this operation has a place among the techniques of plastic surgeons.\r"

Should they happen, the surgeon should search for possible causes, one of which is undetected diabetes mellitus. Six patients are presented who, based on the individual or family history or the unusual nature of their complications, were suspected of having diabetic tendencies. This experience necessitated our in-depth search into the role of silent or undetected diabetes. This report emphasizes the importance of positive family history of diabetes and the role of glucose tolerance tests on suspected cases. Even with normal glucose tolerance tests, however, some of these patients with a positive family history of diabetes and history of previous infections suffer from deficiencies in the chemotactic immune system. We recommend full discussion of the increased risk of infection and delayed healing with these patients, conservatism during surgical procedures, and prophylactic use of antibiotics perioperatively.\r"

Surgeons can detect and manage such patients by (1) having a child sexual abuse therapist on hand for consultation, (2) adding \"abuse\" to the medical history form, (3) recommending to known or suspected child sexual abuse patients preoperative therapy or a self-help book, (4) obtaining specific permission for any body contact, (5) stating belief in abuse, if revealed, (6) explaining the surgery in unusual detail, (7) recognizing the high-risk child sexual abuse groups, and, (8) declining to operate on the angry child sexual abuse patient.\r"

Transplantation was performed for extremity soft-tissue coverage, contour correction, and facial reanimation. Twenty-two patients received serratus transplantation as part of complex reconstruction requiring multiple microvascular transplants. Overall success was 99 percent, with a single flap failure. Four patients suffered partial flap loss. Emergent reexploration for suspected vascular occlusion was infrequent, required in six flaps (6.0 percent), with an 83 percent salvage rate. Significant complications occurred in 18 percent of recipient sites and 12 percent of donor sites, with eight patients developing seroma/hematoma. No scapular winging was noted, and all patients retained full shoulder range of motion. The serratus muscle flap is a highly reliable flap characterized by a consistently long pedicle, excellent malleability, and multipennate anatomy permitting coverage of complex three-dimensional wounds and consistent performance as a functional transplant. Underlying rib can be included as a myo-osseous flap to expand the versatility of this flap.\r"

In our series, the posterior upper arm skin is elevated with the long head of the triceps muscle to cover seven chest-wall defects resulting from indolent postradiation open wounds following partial TRAM flap failure (n = 2), soft-tissue deficiencies following partial TRAM flap loss (n = 3), and primarily as an ancillary flap in TRAM flap breast reconstruction (n = 2). This flap also may be used to supply well-vascularized tissue in the regions of the shoulder, axilla, and posterolateral back. A prerequisite for this operation is redundant tissue of the upper arm often present in middle-aged women and in patients with lymphedema following mastectomy. In our series of seven patients, all donor sites were closed primarily, and there was no subjective functional deficit following transfer of the long head of the triceps muscle.\r"

  ".W": "We have shown in an initial animal study that omentum will adequately vascularize a skin flap and allow transfer of this tissue composite for use in surgical reconstruction of the breast. Based on this experimental procedure, a technique employing a two-stage operation has been developed and used in 21 female patients in reconstruction of the breast after radical mastectomy. In the first stage, the omentum, attached to one gastroepiploic artery and vein, is exteriorized to the subcutaneous tissue of the lower abdominal wall. In the second stage, the distal omentum, now vascularizing the overlying skin and soft tissue, is moved as a secondary island flap to the anterior chest wall to complete the breast reconstruction. In all but 1 of our 21 patients who have been followed for 1 to 8 years, reconstruction of large defects, including the chest wall, breast mound, and infraclavicular axillary fold depression, was performed without use of a prosthesis. In one patient, there was complete necrosis of the flap due to vascular impairment; there were three instances of delayed healing and a significant but partial loss of the flap in one patient. All complications were encountered in the first 10 patients of the series during the time the technique was being refined.\r"
