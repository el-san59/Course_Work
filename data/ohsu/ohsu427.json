The mean duration of action of vecuronium was 57.2 +/- 9.9 min in the unmedicated patients and 54.0 +/- 12.9 min in the ranitidine treated patients. These values were significantly greater than the mean value for nonpregnant control patients (35.3 +/- 8.4 min) but indistinguishable from the mean value for cimetidine pretreated patients (63.0 +/- 17.6 min) reported previously. The combined results of the previous and present studies provide convincing evidence that the clinical duration of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade is significantly longer in the postpartum patient and independent of cimetidine or ranitidine pretreatment.\r"

Platelet counts were measured using an automated Coulter Counter, and bleeding times were measured using the modified Ivy bleeding time technique. Platelet count was significantly lower and bleeding time significantly prolonged in patients with preeclampsia compared with the control group (P less than 0.0001). In the preeclampsia group, eight patients (7.5%) had thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/mm3), whereas in the control group, all women had a normal platelet count (greater than 150,000/mm3). All but one patient with thrombocytopenia had prolonged bleeding time. In addition, 34% of those women with severe preeclampsia and 13% with mild preeclampsia had prolonged bleeding time, although their platelet count was adequate. In the control group, 2% had abnormal bleeding time in the presence of a normal platelet count. There was good correlation between bleeding time and platelet count only when platelet count was lower than 100,000/mm3 (r = -0.76, P less than -0.02).\r"

Maternal heart rate, fetal heart rate, and uterine contractions were continuously recorded and maternal blood pressure was measured every minute for 10 min before and after each patient received either normal saline (NS group; n = 10) or isoproterenol 5 micrograms (ISO group; n = 10) iv. The data-collecting investigator and a nurse palpating the patient's radial artery determined which solution they thought had been administered. The authors analyzed the maternal heart rate tracings using baseline-to-peak (a greater than or equal to 25 beat/min maternal heart rate increase occurring within 120 s of drug injection and lasting greater than or equal to 15 s) and peak-to-peak (a greater than or equal to 10 beat/min increase in the maximum maternal heart rate during the 2-min postinjection over the maximum maternal heart rate during the 2 min preinjection) criteria for detection of an intravascular marker. Mean maternal heart rate in the ISO group was significantly higher than in the NS group 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 s following the injection (P less than 0.01). The peak-to-peak criterion and the data-collecting investigator correctly classified all patients. Five ISO group patients were not identified by the baseline-to-peak criterion. The nurse palpating the mother's radial artery misidentified two patients. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in ISO group than in NS group patients 1 min (P less than 0.05) and 2 min (P less than 0.01) following drug injection. Diastolic and mean blood pressures did not change. No fetal distress occurred. Isoproterenol 5 micrograms is an effective marker of intravascular injection in laboring women; however, the safety and efficacy of epidural isoproterenol must be demonstrated in animals before isoproterenol can be incorporated in an epidural anesthesia test dose.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium on the hemodynamic responses to a noxious stimulus was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were anesthetized with either halothane (group 1, n = 10), or isoflurane (group 2, n = 10). The maximum values for heart rate and mean arterial pressure during the noxious stimulus (base-tail clamp) were measured, and the maximum changes in these values (maximum minus prestimulation) were calculated. The responses were measured at two different anesthetic concentrations (0.6 X MAC, 0.75 X MAC), before and after vecuronium 1.0 mg.kg-1 iv. It was found that neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium did not reduce any of the hemodynamic responses measured, at either anesthetic concentration, in either the halothane or the isoflurane group. However, increasing the anesthetic concentration from 0.6 X MAC to 0.75 X MAC produced statistically significant (P less than 0.01) reductions in several of the responses measured. The inability of vecuronium to reduce hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli in this study suggests that neuromuscular blockade does not alter anesthetic depth in the rat. A knowledge of this \"absence of effect\" may be important for investigators who need to induce muscle relaxation in laboratory animals prior to examining the effect of anesthetic agents on hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli. The results also question the ability of neuromuscular blockade to reduce anesthetic requirement, and support the view that neuromuscular blockade does not contribute to the anesthetic state.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have demonstrated earlier, by direct measurement of acetylcholine (ACh), that d-tubocurarine (d-Tc) and other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants decrease the release of ACh from the indirectly stimulated mouse hemidiaphragm preparation. It was the purpose of the present study to determine whether the decrease of the stimulated release of ACh and the increase in the intensity of the partial neuromuscular block observed at higher stimulation rates is caused by the inhibition of mobilization of ACh from reserve depots to release sites or by inhibition of the release process itself. To attain our objective, the authors have investigated the influence of the progressive increase of the rate of stimulation from 0.1 to 1, 2, 3, and 5 Hz on the force of contraction on the in vitro phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm and in vivo sciatic nerve-tibialis anterior preparation in the absence of drugs and after about 20% neuromuscular block produced by d-Tc or by Mg2+. The latter is known to inhibit the Ca2+ dependent release of ACh. In the absence of drugs increasing the stimulation rate increased the force of contraction, in vivo and in vitro, during both indirect and direct stimulation. In the phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation the increase was significant at 1, 2, 3, and 5 Hz (P less than 0.001) with both types of stimulation. In the sciatic nerve-tibialis anterior preparation the force of contraction was only higher at 3 and 5 Hz (P less than 0.01). The similar magnitude of the increase of the force of contraction during direct and indirect stimulation indicates that it is caused by facilitation of the contraction of the muscle fibers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which halothane and isoflurane interfere with catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction was investigated, utilizing selective agonists of postjunctional alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoceptors in chronically instrumented dogs. After ganglionic, cholinergic, and beta adrenergic blockade, dose responses to phenylephrine (0.3-1.2 micrograms/kg, iv), a selective alpha1 adrenoceptor agonist, and azepexole [B-HT 933] (5-20 micrograms/kg, iv), a selective alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, were obtained in conscious dogs. Each dog was subsequently anesthetized with either halothane (1.7%) or isoflurane (2%) in oxygen in equihypotensive concentrations. After a 1 h equilibration period, the dose response curves were repeated. Twenty experiments in ten chronically instrumented dogs were completed. Halothane and isoflurane produced significant (P less than 0.05) attenuation of both the increase in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure after bolus administration of all doses of phenylephrine and azepexole. No specific selectivity of either volatile anesthetic for alpha1 or alpha2 mediated pressor responses was found. Therefore, in chronically instrumented dogs, alpha1- and alpha2-mediated pressor responses were similarly influenced by halothane and isoflurane. The present results suggest that both halothane and isoflurane act as functional antagonists to alpha adrenergic mediated vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "The ventilatory pharmacodynamics of morphine sulfate (MS) in the awake dog (n = 14) were investigated. Two routes of MS administration were employed: 1) 4 h continuous intravenous (iv) infusion (1 mg.kg-1 loading dose, 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 thereafter); and 2) fourth ventricle to cisterna magna perfusion (VCP) at increasing infusate morphine concentrations (0.1-100 micrograms.ml-1). The former was associated with a constant plasma and cisternal CSF (and presumably tissue) free morphine concentration. The latter produced, over 1 h at a constant infusate morphine delivery, a cisternal CSF free morphine concentration that leveled off by 30 min, little or no distribution of drug beyond superficial dorsal and superficial ventral brainstem tissue, and no detectable levels of morphine in plasma. When comparing the two routes of administration, ventilatory depression for a given cisternal free morphine level in the iv infusion studies was of a much greater magnitude than that seen in VCP experiments. Differences in the ventilatory patterns were also noted. Thus, iv delivery produced a decrease in tidal volume (VT) and no change or reduced respiratory frequency (f) with prolonged exposure. VCP delivery was also associated with reduction in VT but produced significant increases in f. An apparent maximal ventilatory depression with 1 h VCP administration was observed at morphine infusate levels of greater than 10 micrograms.ml-1, with higher infusate concentrations and extension of the perfusion period to 3 h producing no significant additional changes. Finally, VCP delivery of the mu-antagonist nalbuphine could only partially reverse the ventilatory depression accompanying iv morphine administration. These findings suggest that the ventilatory depression associated with iv morphine is a result of interactions with brain u-opiate receptors in superficial brainstem tissue and in deep brainstem and/or suprapontine tissue as well.\r"

It provides an alternative to animal models in testing the performance of anesthesia equipment. A 7.5-1 water-filled manometer simulates pulmonary mechanics. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide flowing into the manometer simulate oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Oil-filled chambers (180 ml and 900 ml) simulate the uptake and washout of halothane by the vessel-rich and muscle tissue groups. A 17.2-1 air-filled chamber simulates uptake by the lung group. Gas circulates through the chambers (3.7, 13.8, and 25 l/min) to simulate the transport of anesthetic to the tissues by the circulatory system. Results show that during induction and washout, the rate of rise in endtidal halothane fraction simulated by the model parallels that measured in patients. The model's end-tidal fraction changes correctly with changes in cardiac output and alveolar ventilation. The model has been used to test anesthetic controllers and to evaluate gas sensors, and should be useful in teaching principles underlying volatile anesthetic uptake.\r"

A simple syringe modification is described by which additional dead space is added to the inflation syringe. The volume of injected gas is also increased to compensate for the dead space, thus ensuring correct balloon inflation. The added dead space acts as a compression chamber should normal balloon inflation be restricted (Safety Syringe). An additional modification is described in which the syringe nozzle is reduced to a pinhole, thus decreasing the rate of gas escape and lessening the possibility of rapid lateral impact of the balloon on the PA wall (Super Safety Syringe). The syringes were compared with a standard volume-limited syringe. Pressures were recorded at the intraluminal site of balloon contact in rigid tubes, live porcine PA, and human cadaver PA. The Safety Syringe consistently generated pressures of less than 975 mmHg, the lowest pressure at which human PA rupture has been demonstrated, under the most adverse simulated clinical conditions. The currently used volume-limited syringe generated a pressure of approximately 1500 mmHg when balloon inflation was restricted, and in one human cadaver PA, produced rupture. The pinhole modification of the Super Safety Syringe increased the time to generate maximum pressure from less than 0.25 s to about 1.5 s.\r"

Resting flow (RF) and the flow on standing (SF) were measured in a room at constant temperature (20-22 degrees C). RF was significantly different in the five groups, being increased in patients with diabetes (in comparison with normal volunteers) and decreased in patients with intermittent claudication, rest pain, and ischemic limbs. The venoarteriolar reflex (in response to standing) was also decreased or abolished in diabetic and in all vascular patients. After treatment of all vascular patients with nifedipine (10 mg tid) for one week, there was a significant increase in RF in all patients. The venoarteriolar reflex was improved but still remained below the normal limit. In conclusion laser-Doppler flowmetry is useful both for differentiating classes of different vascular patients and for evaluating the microcirculatory changes induced by nifedepine.\r"

With the subjects supine, distal foot TcPO2 differed from proximal by an average of +/- 7.4 mmHg, and in 80% of all limbs the differences were between -6 mmHg and +15 mmHg. The two TcPO2's were subsequently combined to yield a single \"average\" value for each foot. TcPO2 measurements were repeated twenty-four to forty-eight hours later; in the supine position the change in \"average\" foot TcPO2 from the first to second measurement was +/- 6.9 mmHg, and in 80% of limbs the changes were between -11 mmHg and +9 mmHg. Similar reproducibility data were also obtained for ankle/brachial blood pressure indices (ABIs), chest TcPO2, and foot TcPO2 during three minutes of leg elevation at 30 degrees. The authors conclude that: (1) TcPO2 measurements from adjacent areas on the dorsum of the foot usually differ by 20-25% or less and (2) the short-term reproducibility of TcPO2 between studies is comparable to that for ABIs.\r"

Its value in patients with coronary artery spasm (CAS) is, however, difficult to ascertain. The authors studied 91 consecutive patients with angiographically documented CAS. All patients underwent a symptom-limited bicycle exercise test before coronary angiography. Eight patients (8.8%) showed ST-segment elevation during exercise; 37 (40.7%), ST-segment depression; and 46 (50.5%), no changes. Thirty patients had normal coronary arteries; 19, one-vessel disease; 19, two-vessel disease; and 23, three-vessel disease. Stress testing yielded abnormal results in 7 of 30 patients (23%) with no CAD and in 38 of 61 (62%) with fixed CAD (p less than 0.01). ST-segment response to exercise did not correlate with most clinical findings such as age, type of angina, duration of pain episodes, or the degree of disease activity. However, a significant correlation was found with the extent and severity of CAD. Absence of ST changes or ST-segment elevation did not differentiate those patients with or without CAD, but only 4 of 37 patients with ST-segment depression had no significant fixed lesions. In conclusion, half of the patients with CAS had a normal stress test. ST-segment elevation is an uncommon finding in these patients and does not reliably differentiate those with and without fixed CAD. The only relevant finding of stress testing in CAS patients is ST-segment depression, which strongly suggests the presence of underlying CAD.\r"

An on-line measurement of (Ca)i with Ca-selective microelectrodes in intact muscle strips provides a suitable means of investigating this problem, although considerable methodologic difficulties exist. Measurements of (Ca)i concentrations during muscle contraction have been carried out by different methods such as Ca-binding techniques and aequorin luminescence, but remain unsatisfying, since they were not performed on intact muscle strips. The authors' measurements were carried out with Ca-selective microelectrodes on rat papillary muscles (stretched to optimal length in a perfusion bath of 1.54 mL at 30 degrees C). The impalement of electrodes was considered adequate when the heights of Ca-electrode potential and membrane potential remained constant for more than twenty minutes. For provoking contractile responses, the authors replaced the normal Tyrode solution by a caffeine-containing contracture solution (content in mM: 0 NaCl [choline], 4 CaCl2, 30 KCl, 25 caffeine, 1.05 MgCl2). Ca-selective microelectrodes were calibrated before and after each measurement and only those impalements were taken as adequate that showed identical calibration curves before and after the experiment. They measured the (Ca)i at 20%, 50%, and 80% of maximal contractile force and obtained (Ca)i concentrations of 1.1 +/- 0.3 microM (at 20%), 3.6 +/- 1.2 microM (at 50%), and 11.8 +/- 0.27 microM (at 80%) (n = 6, +/- SEM). These results represent the fist on-line measurements of the myocardial (Ca)i concentrations with Ca++-selective microelectrodes in intact muscle strips during various degrees of contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The majority of programs provide an introduction to direct medical control, to EMS organizational structure, and the opportunity to participate in EMS-related research. Less than 65%, however, provide formal instruction in EMS risk management or quality assurance or the opportunity to observe policy-making bodies related to EMS. The importance placed on EMS during residency training is variable. EMS is the domain of emergency medicine, and adequate training of residents for these responsibilities is imperative.\r"

We conducted a prospective study to determine if the addition of supine oblique views to the three-view series would improve detection of fractures, subluxations, dislocations, or locked facets. All patients over a two-year period with suspected cervical spine injury had a five-view series obtained (three-view series and supine oblique views), and selected high-risk patients underwent thin-section conventional tomography of the cervical spine. Films were interpreted separately by two radiologists and an emergency physician, and the tomography results were used as the gold standard for comparison. Thirty-three of 58 high-risk patients had one or more fractures, subluxation, or dislocation demonstrated on tomography. There were no fractures or dislocations detected on the five-view series that were not detected or suspected on the three-view series. In areas of the cervical spine reported to be better visualized by supine oblique views than three-view series, our results indicate that supine oblique views did not improve detection but did, in certain cases, allow more specific diagnosis of injuries. Our data do not support the routine use of supine oblique views in the initial radiographic evaluation of patients with cervical spine trauma.\r"

A clinical trauma model was developed using an Alderson RANDO Phantom artificial torso to simulate an actual patient. A radiation monitor was placed where a health care worker's fingers, hands, arms, and thyroid gland would be, and standard cervical spine radiographs were taken. The exposures to the finger positions then were repeated with the monitor inside a 0.5 mm lead-equivalent glove. The mean exposure to the finger for a single cross-table lateral radiograph was 174.5 mrem. The use of leaded gloves reduced this exposure to 0.3 mrem a 99.9% reduction). For a single series of lateral, anteroposterior, odontoid, and swimmer's views, the total mean measured unprotected exposure to the finger of the hand positioned nearest the radiographic tube was 681 mrem and the exposure to the finger of the opposite hand was 230 mrem. If these simulated exposures are indicative of actual patient situations, a health care worker who holds the head of a trauma patient four times each week with unshielded hands would receive more than twice the maximum allowable annual occupational radiation exposure to the extremities recommended by the National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements. We conclude that health care workers who routinely stabilize the necks of trauma patients during cervical spine radiography may incur a radiation exposure risk and that 0.5-mm lead-equivalent gloves provide an effective barrier to ionizing radiation.\r"

During the 12-month study period, there were 4,115 admissions for possible acute myocardial infarction, and 1,076 (26%) had a discharge diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Patients with myocardial infarction had the following characteristics: 60% had ST elevation seen on the first ECG, 17% had ST depression without ST elevation, 75% were less than 75 years old, 75% had no contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, 78% arrived at hospital within six hours of onset of symptoms, and 94% arrived within 24 hours of symptoms. Criteria for administration of thrombolytic therapy can be grouped as restrictive (arrival within six hours of symptoms and ST elevation) or liberal (arrival within 24 hours of symptoms and ST elevation or ST depression). Applying these characteristics, 26% met restrictive criteria for treatment with thrombolytic therapy, and 36% met liberal criteria. Until liberal criteria (therapy up to 24 hours and ST depression) are convincingly shown to be of benefit, we believe clinicians should apply restrictive criteria to potential candidates for thrombolytic therapy.\r"

Our study evaluated whether therapeutic serum levels of phenobarbital and phenytoin could be obtained by the intraosseous route. Twenty domestic swine weighing 10 to 20 kg were divided into two groups (ten each). In one group, phenobarbital 20 mg/kg was administered either intravenously (five) or intraosseously (five). The second group received phenytoin 15 mg/kg either intravenously (five) or intraosseously (five). All animals had samples for anticonvulsant levels drawn from an indwelling arterial cannula at one, three, five, seven, ten, 15, and 30 minutes after dosing. Anticonvulsant levels were found to be statistically significantly higher with IV administration (P less than .01). However, phenobarbital levels were therapeutic by the intraosseous route, while phenytoin levels were below the therapeutic range after the ten-minute interval. Bone marrow levels 45 minutes after infusion were 13.5 micrograms/mL (phenobarbital) and 11.5 micrograms/mL (phenytoin). Our study demonstrates that current IV dosing of phenobarbital 20 mg/kg given intraosseously obtains and maintains therapeutic serum levels. Phenytoin 15 mg/kg does not maintain therapeutic levels and cannot be recommended for intraosseous administration.\r"

  ".W": "Although intubation of emergency patients in the field is a routine measure, endotracheal tube misplacement remains a serious problem. Using radiologic criteria, the frequency of undetected endobronchial intubation by physicians was determined retrospectively in 100 (78 traumatized) field-intubated adult patients (72 men and 28 women; age, 18 to 90 years; mean age, 39.1 years) consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Federal Republic of Germany, between January 1987 and February 1988. Position of tube tip relative to carina was evaluated on anteroposterior chest radiographs made on admission. Inadvertent endobronchial intubation was not recognized by the physician and the admitting anesthesiologist in 7% of the reviewed cases, and endotracheal positioning of the tube tip near the carina (2 or less cm) occurred in another 13%. While unilateral intubation is not immediately catastrophic, the resulting systemic hypoxemia and hypercapnia are aggravated by potential accompanying injury (eg, lung contusion, hematothorax, pneumothorax, shock, or cerebrocranial trauma), which can lead to secondary damage (eg, acute respiratory insufficiency, ischemic brain damage). Evaluation of the depth of tube insertion with the aid of common clinical techniques is particularly unreliable in the case of thoracic trauma, aspiration, or previously existing pulmonary disease. Suggested measures for prevention of endobronchial intubation are improved and intensified training of emergency staff to increase awareness of and prevent the catastrophic effects of endobronchial malposition of the tube tip, tube shortening before intubation, assessment of insertion depth by checking length scale on the tube, and avoidance of patient head and neck movement.\r"

The purpose of our study was to determine whether these delays were related to specific aspects of patient management. From 1981 through 1988, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 122 patients primarily evaluated in the ED and admitted for suspected bacterial meningitis at a university (55) and a community (67) hospital. The median time (interquartile range) from ED registration until initiation of antibiotics (time to antibiotics) was 3.0 hours (1.6 and 4.3 hours, respectively) (total range, 0.5 to 18 hours). The time to antibiotics was not significantly related to the time of ED registration. Ninety percent of the total time to antibiotics occurred after the initial physician encounter. Time to antibiotics was significantly (P less than .00005) longer for patients in whom computed tomography scan and/or laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid preceded initiation of antibiotics compared with patients in whom antibiotic administration was not contingent on the results of these procedures (4.3 [3.2 and 6.0] versus 1.9 [1.2 and 3.4] hours, respectively). Also, time to antibiotics was significantly (P less than .00005) longer for patients in whom antibiotics were initiated on the ward as compared with in the ED (4.5 [3.5 and 6.8] versus 2.2 [1.4 and 3.5] hours, respectively). We conclude that long delays exist in the ED before initiation of antibiotics for cases of suspected bacterial meningitis, and that in general these delays appear to be physician generated and to a great extent potentially avoidable.\r"

Anesthetized animals were instrumented with arterial, venous, and pulmonary artery thermodilution catheters. Iron intoxication was induced by orogastric administration of ferrous sulfate (600 mg/kg elemental iron). Pulmonary artery wedge pressure values were maintained near preintoxication values by saline infusion, and sodium bicarbonate (1.5 mEq/kg/dose) was given for pH less than 7.25. Hourly hemodynamic measurements were obtained for five hours. Cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, pH, and heart rate decreased significantly (P less than .05), whereas systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular stroke work, and oxygen consumption did not change. All animals developed metabolic acidosis despite saline (3.6 +/- 0.9 L, mean +/- SD) and bicarbonate administration (4.2 +/- 0.8 mEq/kg). These findings suggest that decreased cardiac output was partially due to decreased heart rate but not to decreased preload or abnormal left ventricular afterload. Alkali therapy and maintenance of oxygen consumption did not prevent development of metabolic acidosis.\r"

To study whether intermittent exposure to hyperbaric oxygen augments antivenin therapy in reducing muscle necrosis, we injected sublethal doses of Western Diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom intramuscularly into the hind legs of New Zealand White rabbits. In this pilot study, the animals were divided into three treatment groups. The first group received one vial of antivenin intravenously, the second group received one vial of antivenin intravenously plus three hyperbaric oxygen treatments, and the third group received no treatments. There were no statistically significant differences among the groups. These preliminary observations suggest that muscle necrosis secondary to Crotalus atrox venom poisoning is not significantly altered either by Antivenin [Crotalidae] Polyvalent at the dose level we used or in combination with intermittent hyperbaric oxygen treatments in this rabbit model.\r"

Five hundred ninety-nine emergency department patients were enrolled, 242 in the control and 357 in the intervention group. Noncritical patients, selected by presenting complaint, were given the GHQ to complete before physician evaluation; those whose GHQ scores were high (10 or higher) were identified as having a greater likelihood of having psychosocial problems. During the intervention phase, physicians were provided the patient's GHQ score before beginning their evaluation, as well as a specific mechanism for psychosocial referral. A significantly greater proportion of patients with high GHQ scores in both study groups were judged by physicians to have a psychiatric problem (P less than .0001). During the intervention phase, patients with high scores more frequently were assigned a psychiatric diagnosis (14.1% vs 7.7%) and received psychosocial referral (36.1% vs 5.7%). However, only the latter difference was statistically significant (P less than .0001). The majority (85.7%) of patients offered psychosocial referral accepted their referral. There was no difference in the number of laboratory tests ordered or medical/surgical referrals requested between patients in the control or intervention groups with high scores. Therefore, providing GHQ results to emergency physicians led to more frequent psychiatric diagnoses and psychosocial referrals of patients with high GHQ scores but did not alter their medical management.\r"

The mortality rate was 22%, and 17 of 25 patients who died did so during the initial resuscitative efforts, primarily due to head, chest, and or abdominal injury. The average Injury Severity Score (ISS) among all patients was 20; however, it was significantly higher (46) in nonsurvivors. The majority of the victims were men (72%), and the average age of all patients was 35 years. As the patient's age increased, so did the likelihood of mortality, fractures, and prolonged hospital stay. Blood alcohol levels were measured in 85 patients, 65% of whom had detectable levels (mean, 0.25 mg/dL). There was no correlation between the presence of alcohol and mortality, ISS, head injury, or number of fractures. The most frequently injured organ system was musculoskeletal (77%), followed by head (34%), abdomen (21%), and chest (15%). The most common fractures seen were tibia-fibular (39), pelvis (35), and femur (31). Hospital stay averaged 11 days, and patients charges averaged $16,900.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, open trial study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a government referral-based research hospital. PATIENTS: Volunteer sample of 39 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and Kaposi sarcoma. Interventions: Patients received zidovudine, 250, 100, or 50 mg orally every 4 hours; 6 weeks after interferon-alpha was begun at a dose of 5 million U/d, and the dose was increased every 2 weeks until a maximum tolerated dose was determined. Patients then received the maximum tolerated dose of the combination for a minimum of 12 weeks before formal efficacy evaluations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the dose-escalation phase, the ability to tolerate interferon-alpha was clearly related to the zidovudine dose. Of the 13 patients receiving 250 mg of zidovudine, only 1 patient was able to tolerate at least 10 million U/d of interferon-alpha. Of the 12 patients receiving 100 mg of zidovudine, 8 tolerated 10 million U/d, 5 tolerated 15 million U/d, and none tolerated higher doses. Of the 12 patients receiving 50 mg of zidovudine, 8 tolerated 10 million U/d, 7 tolerated 15 million U/d, and 6 tolerated 20 million U/d or more. Dose-limiting toxicities included neutropenia (57%), fatigue (16%), thrombocytopenia (14%), and hepatic dysfunction (10%). Of the 22 patients who received a stable dose of both drugs for 12 weeks, 11 patients had a complete or partial tumor response and 8 showed an anti-HIV effect. Peak serum levels of interferon-alpha (32 to 250 U/mL) and zidovudine (0.40 to 3.85 microM) were in the ranges previously shown to be synergistic against HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with zidovudine and interferon-alpha can be administered to patients with HIV infection and Kaposi sarcoma in doses that effect antiviral and antitumor responses; it appears to have a potential role in managing such patients.\r"

PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 18 men with testosterone deficiency who had prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, 15 men with acquired secondary hypogonadism and normal prolactin levels, and 33 normal male controls. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found a significant elevation in fasting cholesterol (6.23 +/- 0.28 mmol/L [mean +/- SE] compared with 5.17 +/- 0.13 mmol/L [241 +/- 11 mg/dL compared with 200 +/- 5 mg/dL], P less than 0.01), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (4.11 +/- 0.23 mmol/L compared with 3.34 +/- 0.13 mmol/L [159 +/- 9 mg/dL compared with 129 +/- 5 mg/dL], P less than 0.05), and triglycerides (1.85 +/- 0.26 mmol/L compared with 1.11 +/- 0.07 mmol/L [164 +/- 23 mg/dL compared with 98 +/- 6 mg/dL], P less than 0.001) in men with hyperprolactinemia compared with controls. In the normoprolactinemic hypogonadal men, cholesterol (6.28 +/- 0.34 mmol/L [243 +/- 13 mg/dL], P less than 0.01), LDL cholesterol (4.34 +/- 0.34 mmol/L [168 +/- 13 mg/dL], P less than 0.01), and triglycerides (1.61 +/- 0.18 mmol/L [143 +/- 16 mg/dL], P less than 0.05) were also significantly higher than in the controls, and were the same as in the hyperprolactinemic men. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not differ among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hypogonadism in men, with or without hyperprolactinemia, may be associated with elevation of fasting serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with normal men. These data suggest that serum lipid levels should be evaluated in hypogonadal men. The presence of lipid abnormalities may affect the decision to treat testosterone deficiency in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "A mononucleosis-like illness is frequently recognized retrospectively as the first manifestation of infection with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). This acute but transient retroviral syndrome may include symptoms such as malaise, fever, sweats, myalgia, arthralgia, maculopapular rash, diarrhea, and lymphocytic meningitis. We observed two intravenous drug users who developed a severe, febrile illness with subsequent oral thrush (one also had biopsy-proven esophageal candidiasis). Both patients had weight loss, arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue. These symptoms occurred two weeks after needle-sharing and persisted for 7 weeks in one patient and 10 weeks in the other. Both patients had serologic evidence for both acute HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus enhances HIV-1 replication in vitro, presumably by stimulating HIV-1 gene expression. Thus, the observed syndrome suggests that this viral interaction may be clinically significant because it appears to cause severe additional morbidity, which is not typical for primary infection with HIV-1. After 6 months of follow-up, one patient is completely asymptomatic but shows markedly reduced CD4+ lymphocytes. The other patient developed persistent lymphadenopathy after the acute illness, but is feeling well 21 months after infection.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the development of expertise in dermatology, accuracy of diagnosis and response times of subjects at five levels of expertise were assessed. A total of 100 slides, 2 typical and 3 atypical slides from each of 20 common skin disorders, were presented to six subjects at each of the following levels: second-year preclinical medical students, final year medical students, residents in family medicine, general practitioners, and dermatologists. Accuracy of diagnosis rose from 21% for medical students to 87% for dermatologists. Correct diagnosis was associated with a decrease in response time with expertise, whereas errors were associated with a dramatic increase in response time, and was slower than correct response times at all levels, suggesting that errors do not result predominantly from carelessness or speed. Typical slides accounted for a constant proportion of diagnostic errors at all higher levels of expertise, and experts continued to make a significant proportion of errors on slides shown to be relatively easy for residents. The results are shown to be at variance with any model that equates expertise with the mastery of complex rules, but they are consistent with models of expertise that propose that expertise is equated with a rapid \"pattern-recognition\" process, and errors result from unintended confusion with previous similar examples.\r"

There is disagreement regarding the most appropriate name for this disease. The pathologic process has been identified by various authors as reactive perforating collagenosis, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, perforating folliculitis, or Kyrle's disease. We have seen four patients with renal disease and/or diabetes whose skin biopsy specimens demonstrated combined transepidermal elimination of both collagen and elastic fibers. This finding is not characteristically seen in any of the previously defined perforating diseases. Since the histologic findings vary greatly in different lesions from different patients with renal disease, we recommend referring to this process as \"acquired perforating dermatosis.\" It is best not to create a new category of perforating disease or to say that a given patient has one of the other four diseases based on random sampling of only a few lesions.\r"

Pepsin-extracted human amnion collagen and skin collagen were purified and reconstituted. Implants of amnion collagen demonstrated greater persistence than skin collagen. For amnion collagen implants, no significant inflammatory response was found. Fibroblast and adipocyte ingrowth and neovascularization were present. Conversely, obvious inflammatory infiltration was evident in the skin collagen implants. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that anti-amnion collagen antibody levels were significantly lower than anti-skin collagen antibody levels against their respective implant materials. The ratios of type I to type III collagen are 56:44 and 95:5 for amnion collagen and skin collagen, respectively. These findings suggest that in this heterologous type system, type III collagen-rich amnion collagen preparations appear superior to skin collagen for soft-tissue augmentation.\r"

Their microanatomical basis lies in the hypodermis where trabeculae of the retinacula cutis are broader and much shorter underneath the wrinkle than in the surrounding skin. These trabeculae contain striated muscle cells. The hypertrophy of the extracellular matrix of the hypodermal septae is probably related to repetitive mechanical stimuli generated by the muscle cells.\r"

All stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep were associated with leg rubbing. After treatment that included avoidance of daytime naps and administration of chlorpromazine at bedtime, affect, daytime behavior, nocturnal sleep, and the ulcers improved markedly. To our knowledge, there are no reports of factitial dermatosis associated with disordered sleep. Our findings suggest that abnormal sleep may play a role in initiating or perpetuating factitial dermatoses. This case illustrates that polysomnography and video monitoring may be indicated in the evaluation of patients with factitial dermatoses.\r"

Plasma extracts from seven of these 11 patients were assayed for acid secretagogue activity in rats. All seven plasma extracts had secretagogue activity that was not found in the plasma extracts of ten patients with ordinary duodenal ulcer disease. Each of the tumor or pancreatic tissue extracts obtained from nine patients exhibited secretagogue activity in rats even though tissue gastrin content was 101.9 pmol (213.8 ng).g-1 or less. The secretagogue activity of the tumor extracts was confirmed in conscious gastric fistula dogs. The tumors' secretagogue activity, in contrast to gastrin, was destroyed by trypsin. It was eluted between porcine motilin and human gastrin I from a Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) superfine column and was not retained by CM-cellulose, at pH 8.5. Its retention time during reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column also differed from those of G17 and G34. Thus, this secretagogue activity appeared mediated by a small, acidic peptide with a molecular size of about 2000 to 3000 daltons. The present study indicates that plasma and tumor extracts of these 11 patients contain a gastric acid secretagogue activity mediated by a nongastrin peptide. We suggest that what may be a distinct clinical entity associated with endocrine neoplasms of the pancreas should be considered in the face of excessive acid hypersecretion without fasting hypergastrinemia.\r"

The patients were followed with regard to gastric cancer development until their death or the end of the year 1982 and the incidence of cancer in this cohort was compared to the incidence in the total population in the same region during the same period. A total of 46 gastric cancers were diagnosed versus 47 expected. Up to 15 years after operation the cancer risk was lower than expected. After 15 years the risk was higher than expected with a 2.1-fold higher incidence after 25 years for the total patient population. The highest risk was observed in male subjects undergoing a Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy with a 3.2 times increase in risk after 25 years. There was no difference between gastric and duodenal ulcer patients; and patients undergoing simple suture for a perforated ulcer showed no increase in cancer incidence. Patients with long-lasting symptoms had the same incidence as patients with briefer symptoms. These observations indicate that the operation per se and not the ulcer disease may be precancerous.\r"

True ampullary tumors had a significantly better 5-year survival rate (p = 0.028) than periampullary tumors. The type of mucin produced was investigated histochemically. Patients with true ampullary tumors producing predominantly sialomucins had a better prognosis than those with tumors secreting sulphated mucins (p = 0.045), but the numbers were small.

Because IgA antibody in bile accounts for much of the specific immune defense of the upper intestinal tract in the rat, the effect of thermal injury on the quantity of IgA protein in bile was examined. Sprague-Dawley rats received a 20% to 30% body surface area burn under anesthesia. Eighteen hours later the common bile duct was cannulated and bile was collected for three hours. Total IgA protein in bile decreased 90% after thermal injury. The bile volume, the concentration of bile protein, and free secretory component did not change significantly. Although blood flow to the liver 18 hours after thermal injury was not changed, there was a significant reduction in total IgA concentration in the circulation; both monomeric (m-IgA) and polymeric IgA (p-IgA) were decreased. This finding may explain, in part, the reduced concentration of IgA protein in bile. Although not examined in this study, decreased local hepatic synthesis and/or transport of p-IgA across the hepatocyte may also contribute to the reduced IgA levels in bile.\r"

Early postoperative small bowel obstruction was most often due to adhesions and inflammatory processes. Seven patients died (6.9%), three in the operated and four in the nonoperated group. Because ischemic bowel is very unlikely in patients with early postoperative small bowel obstruction, we advise 10 to 14 days of nasogastric suction initially; after this, improvement is unlikely without reoperation.\r"

All patients underwent emergency subtotal colectomy with primary ileocolonic or ileorectal anastomosis. The quality of life for patients undergoing subtotal colectomy is excellent. All patients enjoy an almost normal diet and those with an ileorectal anastomosis stabilize on two to three bowel movements per day. During a followup period of 65 months, four patients died from spread of their primary disease while two other patients died of unrelated causes. Sixteen patients are alive and free of disease.

This was done to provide an alternate technique for the assessment of the receptor status of tumors that could not be adequately assayed with other biochemical or immunocytological methods. Fixation in Zamboni's fixative followed by passage through cold methanol and acetone before storage at -80 C insured good preservation of the receptor proteins over extended periods of time (up to 56 weeks). Immunostaining of these stored preparations with monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (H222) and progesterone receptor (JZB39 and KD68) showed a high degree of correspondence with immunocytochemical assays (ER-ICA and PR-ICA) and biochemical analysis. This technique is easy to perform and provides reliable information, even in tumors that are too small and/or ill defined to permit separate sampling for receptor assays.\r"

The clinical information and abdominal CT examinations of 482 consecutive children were reviewed prospectively for indications for abdominal CT and presence and severity of abdominal and chest injury. Children were divided into two groups determined by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): GCS less than 8, and greater than or equal to 8. The prevalence and severity of thoracoabdominal injury were higher in the neurologically impaired group. These children had a higher frequency of abdominal injury (GCS less than 8, 25 of 90 patients (27.8%) vs. GCS greater than or equal to 8, 70 of 392 patients (17.8%); p = 0.047 by Chi square test), injury to multiple abdominal organs (16.7% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.0002), chest injury (32.2% vs. 0.09%; p = 0.0001), and combined chest and abdominal injury (18.9% vs. 4.6%; p = 0.0001). In addition, the mortality rate in children with a GCS less than 8 was significantly higher (GCS less than 8, 24% vs. GCS greater than or equal to 8, 0.26%; p = 0.0001). Eleven children had a GCS less than 8 as the only indication for abdominal CT examination. All 11 children had a normal CT of the abdomen. Every child with abdominal injury on CT scan had specific abdominal signs suggestive of underlying injury. Three neurologically impaired children required abdominal surgery (3.3%) vs. 14 of 369 (3.8%) children with a GCS greater than or equal to 8; p = NS). We conclude that children with severe neurologic impairment are at higher risk for intraabdominal injury than those without coma, but that neurologic impairment without abdominal signs is a low-yield indication for abdominal CT examination. Abdominal CT scan should be reserved for children in whom there is a high clinical index of suspicion of significant abdominal trauma based on physical examination and the mechanism of injury.\r"

Manometry showed typical contraction \"clusters\" with alternating quiescence, each of two to four minutes duration, in obstructed jejunum proximal to the balloon. The distal jejunum was inhibited. SVA showed a pattern of hyperactivity and quiescence corresponding to proximal jejunal activity. In the clinical situation, SVA recordings taken after a standard meal in nine patients with suspected chronic obstruction adhesive obstruction, (subsequently proven in seven patients and disproved in two), and 36 volunteers were compared. All patients with proved obstruction showed an SVA pattern of alternating hyperactivity and quiescence. This pattern was not observed in volunteers or nonobstructed patients.\r"

Overall survival, valve-related death, primary tissue failure, failure due to surgical technical error, infective endocarditis, and overall event-free survival have been assessed and compared. Overall survival 20 years after operation was 51.6% +/- 8.1% with a low incidence of sudden death. The method and length of preservation did not have any effect on the long-term performance or the mode of failure of the homografts. The rate of primary tissue failure was apparently higher with valves preserved in a solution containing calf serum, but the difference was not significant. It is concluded that long-term patient survival and quality of life after aortic valve replacement with a homograft are excellent. The current study, however, could not verify the existence of a significant difference between the three assessed methods of homograft preservation. Furthermore, it could not prove the importance of cellular viability or the existence of clinically significant immunological factors other than the calf serum content of the nutrient medium.\r"

Isolated perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of hypothermic (32 degrees C) multidose cardioplegia-induced ischemia. Control hearts (n = 23) received modified St. Thomas's cardioplegia, and the remaining hearts received cardioplegia with either 100 microM (n = 11), 200 microM (n = 11), or 400 microM (n = 11) adenosine. After ischemia and 45 minutes of reperfusion, left ventricular contractility was superior in all groups of adenosine-treated hearts compared with control hearts. Furthermore, there was a significant incremental increase in functional recovery with increasing dose of adenosine. Postischemic diastolic stiffness was significantly better in all adenosine groups compared with controls. No differences were noted in coronary flow or myocardial water content between adenosinetreated and control hearts. These data demonstrate that adenosine administered in these concentrations provides myocardial protection and improved recovery of both systolic and diastolic function after global ischemia, presumably metabolically by reducing depletion of adenosine triphosphate or enhancing repletion of adenosine triphosphate and enabling improved postischemic recovery.\r"

Infarct location was anterior in 57%, inferior in 33%, and combined in 10%. The hospital mortality among 9 patients not receiving surgical therapy was 100%. Of the 33 surgically treated patients, 19 (58%) survived. Time from diagnosis to operation, ventricular function, and presence or absence of shock were analyzed in a logistic regression model to determine which factors carried independent prognostic value. Shock was independently predictive of operative mortality (p less than 0.01). Of additional variables examined, nonsurvivors were characterized by a shorter time from postinfarction ventricular septal defect to operation, a relatively higher incidence of inferior infarction, moderate right ventricular dysfunction and mild left ventricular dysfunction, and a lower right ventricular systolic pressure. Results of postmortem examination were available for 15 nonsurvivors. Quantitative analysis of percent ventricle infarcted revealed that in patients with inferior infarctions, a mean of 31% of the right ventricle was infarcted compared with 10% in patients with anterior infarction (p = 0.059). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates revealed 1-year survival of 70%, 5-year survival of 55%, and 10-year survival of 20%. Seventy percent of survivors were in New York Heart Association class I or II. These data show that, irrespective of ventricular function or timing of operation, the development of shock is the most important predictor of survival in postinfarction ventricular septal defect. The higher mortality in patients with inferior infarction may be associated with a greater degree of right ventricular infarction and consequent dysfunction. Finally, long-term survival and excellent functional recovery can be achieved in patients undergoing operation.\r"

One hundred ninety-two of these patients died, a late mortality of 16.9%. Sixty-four patients experienced thromboembolic episodes (17 major and 35 permanent). Twenty-four patients had anticoagulant-related bleeding, 4 had valve thrombosis, 7 had prosthetic valve endocarditis, 9 had paravalvular leak, and 10 underwent reoperation. There was no structural valve failure in this series. Twenty-two of the 118 patients who had valve-related complications died; another 15 patients died of sudden and unknown causes. Therefore, the total number of valve-related deaths was 37. Of those patients who survived, New York Heart Association functional class improved significantly (98% in classes II and III preoperatively and 96% in classes I and II postoperatively). Linearized rates for thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and anticoagulant-related bleeding were 1.49% +/- 0.19%, 0.09% +/- 0.05%, and 0.56% +/- 0.11%/100 patient-years, respectively. The actuarial estimate of incidence free from all complications, operative death, and valve-related death was 66.9% +/- 8.2% at the end of 9 years.

We reviewed 52 patients (aged 18 months to 82 years; mean age, 34 years) treated with transsternal radical thymectomy between 1972 and 1987. Patients were symptomatically staged according to the modified Osserman classification. There was one hospital death and postoperative follow-up was obtained on 51 patients. Improvement after thymectomy was observed in 3 of 11 patients (27%) in Osserman stage I, 16 of 25 patients (64%) in Osserman stage IIA, and 13 of 15 patients (86%) in combined Osserman stages IIB, III, and IV. Preoperative Osserman stage, patient sex, and thymic histology correlated with postoperative clinical response. Transsternal radical thymectomy is effective therapy for myasthenia gravis. Sustained improvement is obtained in patients with moderate and advanced disease. The majority of patients with ocular disease do not benefit from operation.\r"

Between 1967 and 1987, 10 patients, ranging in age from 5 to 39 years, were found to have an intralobar sequestration. Nine patients (90%) had a history of recurrent pulmonary infections, chronic cough, and intermittent fevers. One patient was asymptomatic. Many patients had been treated with antibiotics on numerous occasions. The delay in diagnosis varied between 3 months and 7 years (mean delay, 1.5 years). The chest roentgenogram was abnormal in all patients. The intralobar sequestration was present in the left lower lobe in 7 patients and the right lower lobe in 3 patients. Bronchography was abnormal in 4 patients in whom it was done. Bronchoscopy was performed in 7 patients, but it was only helpful in excluding other diagnoses. Preoperative thoracic arteriography in 9 patients visualized the systemic arterial supply from the thoracic or abdominal aorta to the intralobar sequestration and helped prevent any catastrophic surgical bleeding. A lobectomy was performed in 9 patients and a segmentectomy in 1 patient without morbidity or mortality. In patients with recurrent infections in the same lower lobe, a high index of suspicion for an intralobar sequestration should prompt early diagnostic arteriography and, if confirmed, early operative intervention.\r"

In the other 11 patients, our new method was indicated because the pleural space was not closed completely by simple decortication. In our procedure, the parietal wall is collapsed, without rib resection, to contact the surface of the decorticated lung. All 11 patients had a one-stage cure. Two of these 11 patients had bronchopleural fistula. The preoperative and postoperative percentage of vital capacity, percentage of forced expiratory volume in 1 second, arterial oxygen tension, alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference, and xenon 133 radiospirometry revealed that pulmonary function was well preserved in patients treated by our method as well as in those undergoing simple decortication. The alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure difference during oxygen inhalation improved significantly (p less than 0.05) after operation compared with the preoperative values in both groups. From the pulmonary function studies, we conclude that our method achieves results comparable with those of simple decortication for the treatment of chronic empyema thoracis. Our procedure is indicated in patients for whom it is thought simple decortication will not lead to primary cure of empyema.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two (32.8%) of 67 patients who had patch graft aortoplasty for aortic coarctation underwent reoperation because of aneurysm formation opposite or at the site of the patch. The mean age at primary repair was 25.3 years (standard deviation, 9.5 years). Reoperation took place 12.3 years (standard deviation, 3.7 years) later. In 19 patients, the aneurysm was resected and the aorta reconstructed with a tubular prosthesis. In 3 patients, the aneurysm was given external support. There were no hospital deaths. Recurrent nerve paralysis (36%) and bleeding necessitating repeat thoracotomy (32%) were the most common complications. Mean follow-up was 4.6 years. No aneurysms developed at the site of reoperation. Two patients died of causes not related to reoperation. Reconstruction with a tubular prosthesis gives good long-term results in patients with aneurysm formation after patch grafting for coarctation. External support offers technical advantages in select patients. Close follow-up of patients who have coarctation repair with a patch graft is essential.\r"

In 7 Yorkshire white swine, the heart and lungs were separated and removed with the liver, pancreas, duodenum, and both kidneys en bloc while they were self-perfused. Fresh blood, glucose, electrolytes, heparin sodium, methylprednisolone, and a fat emulsion (Soyacal) were infused through the portal vein. No inotropic drugs were necessary. The organs survived for 18 to 37 hours (average survival, 24.6 +/- 2.7 hours [+/- standard error of the mean]). Aortic systolic pressure ranged from 78.5 +/- 5.5 to 98.7 +/- 11.8 mm Hg. Arterial oxygen tension ranged from 206 +/- 23 to 266 +/- 15 mm Hg and arterial carbon dioxide tension, from 20.1 +/- 2.7 to 32.1 +/- 4.9 mm Hg. Blood lactic acid levels decreased from 8.75 +/- 2.06 to 5.50 +/- 2.45 mmol/L at 24 hours. Urine output ranged from 25 to 82 mL/h. Blood urea nitrogen levels decreased from 9.17 +/- 0.59 to 4.67 +/- 1.08 mg/dL. Blood creatinine levels decreased from 1.34 +/- 0.10 to 0.57 +/- 0.22 mg/dL.

Red blood cell count ranged from 6.94 +/- 0.58 to 13.23 +/- 2.30 x 10(6)/microliters. Lung wet/dry weight ratios changed from 5.79 +/- 0.17 at the beginning to 6.25 +/- 0.16 at 24 hours. The technique for simultaneous multiorgan preservation presented here is simple, effective, and highly reproducible. This study appears to have produced one of the longest average survival times for autoperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Life-threatening tension pneumothorax in neonates on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been associated with an increase in arterial oxygen tension and a decrease in peripheral perfusion, followed by a decrease in ECMO flow with progressive hemodynamic deterioration. To investigate this triad, chest tubes were placed bilaterally in 9 dogs to allow injection of air to produce tension pneumothorax. Six dogs were subsequently placed on standard venoarterial ECMO before the reinduction of tension pneumothorax. Measured values included arterial pulse pressure, inferior vena cava pressure, systemic arterial blood gases, peripheral arterial oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and left heart cardiac output. Oxygen delivery was calculated from directly measured values. Each of the 6 dogs on ECMO demonstrated the triad of increased arterial oxygen tension (92 +/- 7 to 325 +/- 20 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), decreased peripheral perfusion (as evidenced by a decrease in pulse pressure from 55 +/- 4 to 31 +/- 5 mm Hg; p less than 0.05), and decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (71% +/- 3% to 22% +/- 2% saturation; p less than 0.05) followed by a lower ECMO flow with progressive hemodynamic deterioration (oxygen delivery decreased from 285 +/- 11 to 111 +/- 12 mL/min; p less than 0.05). Aspiration of the intrathoracic air allowed return to baseline ECMO flow and hemodynamic stability in all dogs. The triad of increased arterial oxygen tension and decreased peripheral perfusion (as evidenced by a lower arterial pulse pressure and lower mixed venous oxygen saturation) followed by decreased ECMO flow with progressive hemodynamic deterioration consistently appears when tension pneumothorax occurs on ECMO.\r"

We studied the long-term effects of extensive cryoablation of the posterior papillary muscle and its ventricular attachment in 10 dogs. The dogs had hemodynamic, electrophysiological, and angiographic testing 1 month after operation. Seven dogs were then killed, and the hearts were examined at that time. Three dogs had repeat assessments 2 and 3 months after operation before they were killed. At 1 month, left ventricular angiography showed normal mitral valve function in all dogs. Pathological examination revealed that the posterior papillary muscle and its left ventricular attachment were replaced by a discrete dense, fibrous scar. The fibrous process involved the mitral valve in 2 dogs. At 3 months, pathological examination showed a marked fibrous scar with chondroid metaplasia and fibrous involvement of the mitral valve chordae and posterior leaflet in all 3 dogs. We conclude that extensive cryoablation of the posterior papillary muscle is not associated with long-term mitral valve dysfunction, and may be the best surgical technique to ablate an arrhythmogenic papillary muscle.\r"

The hemodynamic disturbance in all patients was the consequence of a large left-to-right shunt (mean pulmonary/systemic flow ratio, 2.38:1) with increased pulmonary vascular resistance (mean value, 4.47 units/m2). Our initial surgical experience with closure under cardiopulmonary bypass through the transaortic route in 3 patients and the transpulmonary approach in two patients resulted in 3 deaths. In the 9 subsequent patients, division and repair of the defect in the great vessels yielded uniformly good results. During follow-up, which ranged from 3 months to 2 years, all 11 survivors had good clinical improvement and none showed residual defects on restudy. Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased in all patients except 1.\r"

The 10 male and 4 female patients ranged in age from 14 to 59 years (mean age, 29 years). In all patients, the procedure was performed under general anesthesia. The thoracoscope was introduced through a 1- to 1.5-cm incision in the anterior axillary line of the fourth intercostal space. The fiber of the laser was advanced through the operative channel of the thoracoscope. In all patients, the bleb (or blebs) detected in the apex of the upper lobe was successfully coagulated with low-power laser pulses. Then the parietal pleura of the first five ribs was partially scarified to achieve pleurodesis. There were no side effects. Thirteen patients were successfully treated without recurrence (maximum follow-up, 29 months). We conclude that this new therapy can play an important role in select patients with spontaneous pneumothorax.\r"

The data from arterial blood gas analysis, ie, pH, arterial oxygen tension, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and HCO3-, were within normal limits during and after occlusion of the superior vena cava. Intracranial pressure was 8.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error) before occlusion and rose to 22.1 +/- 2.2 mm Hg during clamping. It decreased significantly to 17.7 +/- 1.9 mm Hg just before removal of the clamp and recovered to 8.6 +/- 0.9 mm Hg after the clamp was removed. Regional cerebral blood flow was 45 +/- 9 mL/min/100 g before clamping and decreased to 37 +/- 3 mL/min/100 g during clamping. It recovered to 47 +/- 5 mL/min/100 g after removal of the clamp. Cerebral perfusion pressure was within the margin of safety during clamping. Histological findings in the brain showed the effect of congestion in 1 monkey, but the change was slight. The electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram showed no abnormalities in this experiment. In conclusion, one-hour clamping of the superior vena cava with the azygos vein ligated was safe in 6 cynomolgus monkeys. We believe that in the clinical setting, one-hour occlusion of the superior vena cava would result in findings similar to those in this study, unless particular complications, such as arteriosclerosis or a cerebrovascular disorder, exist.\r"

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), frequently used to treat neonatal respiratory failure, can provide cardiac support and is effective treatment of postoperative myocardial failure in children. From 1981 to 1987, 10 patients aged 2 days to 5 years were maintained on ECMO for 15 to 144 hours (mean duration, 92 +/- 16 hours) after cardiotomy. Operative procedures included repair of tetralogy of Fallot (2 patients), closure of a ventricular septal defect (2), the Senning procedure for transposition of the great arteries (1 patient), repair of interrupted aortic arch with closure of a ventricular septal defect (1), repair of a partial atrioventricular septal defect (2), closure of a ventricular septal defect with excision of an anomalous muscle bundle (1), and the Fontan procedure (1). Venoarterial ECMO was established in all 10 children. Six patients underwent transthoracic right atrium-ascending aorta cannulation, 3 had right internal jugular vein-right common carotid artery cannulation through a cervical incision, and 1 had right internal jugular vein-left axillary artery cannulation. Eight of the 10 patients were successfully weaned from ECMO, and 7 are long-term survivors. There were 3 deaths; 1 was caused by cardiac and acute renal failure complicated by sepsis two days after decannulation, another occurred 19 days after atrioventricular septal defect repair, and 1 was caused by massive pulmonary hemorrhage. Major hemorrhage developed in 3 patients while on ECMO; 2 required premature decannulation for mediastinal bleeding from operative sites and ultimately survived, and 1 died of respiratory failure as a result of endobronchial bleeding. We conclude that the use of ECMO in pediatric populations for transient postoperative ventricular dysfunction improves survival with limited overall morbidity.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigates whether the addition of magnesium to a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution containing 0.1 mM ionized calcium improves myocardial preservation, and whether there is an optimal magnesium concentration in this solution. Isolated perfused rat hearts were arrested for two hours by this cardioplegic solution, which was fully oxygenated and infused at 8 degrees C every 15 minutes to simulate clinical conditions. The cardioplegic solution contained either 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mM magnesium. At end-arrest, the myocardial creatine phosphate concentration (nanomoles per milligram of dry weight) was 20.7 +/- 2.1, 22.9 +/- 1.7, 24.8 +/- 2.0, 31.3 +/- 1.4, 33.1 +/- 1.8, and 31.6 +/- 0.8, respectively, in hearts given cardioplegic solution containing these magnesium concentrations. Thus, the concentration of creatine phosphate was significantly higher at end-arrest when the cardioplegic solution contained 8, 16, or 32 mM than 0 or 2 mM magnesium (p less than 0.002) or 4 mM magnesium (p less than 0.02), and highest with 16 mM magnesium. Also, creatine phosphate was more sensitive to the magnesium concentration of the cardioplegic solution than was end-arrest adenosine triphosphate levels, which did not differ among the experimental groups. Aortic flow, expressed as a percentage of prearrest aortic flow, was 60.3 +/- 5.0, 70.2 +/- 5.5, 71.6 +/- 4.4, 71.8 +/- 4.8, 81.0 +/- 5.0, and 71.8 +/- 5.3, respectively. The addition of magnesium to the cardioplegic solution improved recovery of aortic flow (p less than 0.05, 16 mM versus 0 mM magnesium). We conclude from these data that with deep myocardial hypothermia and at an ionized calcium concentration of 0.1 mM, the addition of magnesium, over a broad concentration range, improved preservation of myocardial creatine phosphate and, at a concentration of 16 mM, improved aortic flow. The optimal magnesium concentration in the cardioplegic solution was 16 mM.\r"

Although several articles indicate a possible connection of cocaine with coronary spasm and acute myocardial infarction, this study in seven patients with a history of cocaine abuse, who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, suggests that cocaine may cause direct toxicity to the myocardium. Myocardial specimens from five of seven patients showed multifocal myocyte necrosis, of which two specimens revealed focal myocarditis, while three specimens had changes consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructurally, extensive loss of myofibrils and sarcoplasmic vacuolization were observed. It is postulated that the pathogenesis of acute cocaine-induced toxicity is direct destruction of myofibrils resulting in myocyte necrosis and that these changes may or may not be associated with interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates. Long-term abuse of cocaine may lead to interstitial fibrosis and eventually congestive heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Four plexosarcomas (gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumors) characterized by light microscopic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural examination, including immunoelectron microscopy in one case, are described. The four neoplasms occurred in the small intestine (duodenum, two; jejunum, one; and ileum, one) and they had an aggressive course with either local or distant metastases. The light-microscopic patterns varied from epithelioid and organoid to spindle cells, mimicking endocrine and sarcomatous neoplasms. Ultrastructurally, these tumors exhibited interdigitating cytoplasmic processes that contained scattered aggregates of membrane-bound granules varying in size from 100 to 300 nm intermixed with empty vesicles and numerous diffusely distributed intermediate filaments. Basal lamina covering cell surfaces, attachment plaques, and myofilaments, as expected in smooth-muscle tumors, were not identified, and diffusely distributed membrane-bound granules, as seen in paragangliomas and carcinoid tumors, were also absent. By immunocytochemistry, the tumors were intensely positive for vimentin and neuron-specific enolase and focally positive for neurofilaments and synaptophysin. In addition, three tumors were S100 protein positive and one stained for vasoactive intestinal peptide. Similar positive immunocytochemical reactions were identified in normal enteric plexus. It is essential to recognize plexosarcomas, which are invariably accompanied by aggressive clinical behavior, in spite of a seemingly benign, mitotically inactive light-microscopic appearance in most instances. Ultrastructural examination can readily separate plexosarcomas from paragangliomas and other sarcomatous and endocrine neoplasms.\r"

Although morphologic, immunocytochemical, and molecular data point to predominant human immunodeficiency virus infection of multinucleated and mononuclear macrophages, neuroglial and other cells are thought to be involved as well. Electron microscopic studies of biopsy tissue that might further define the neuropathologic changes have been limited. The opportunity to study well-preserved biopsy tissue from a 38-year-old man with the acute onset of dementia and AIDS encephalopathy prompted this report. Human immunodeficiency virus was seen budding from the surface of multinucleated and mononuclear cells with morphologic features of macrophages; a rare astrocyte process showed evidence of viral infection as well. Macrophages were noted within the walls of blood vessels and in intimate contact with lymphocytes within the neuropil. Notably rare were tubuloreticular inclusions, interferon-related cytoplasmic structures commonly found in systemic endothelial cells and lymphocytes in AIDS. Their relative scarcity may signify reduced interferon production in AIDS encephalopathy.\r"

The highest concentration of amyloid was measured at the walls of intraplaque capillaries. Spectroscopic images revealed a decreasing gradient of amyloid concentration with increasing distance from intraplaque capillaries. The concentration of amyloid in nonplaque capillaries was lower than that measured in capillaries within well-developed amyloid plaques. These findings support the premise that plaque amyloid deposition starts at the level of the capillary.\r"

Ultrastructural study of the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies revealed that the initial stage of calcification appeared to be the deposit of needle-shaped apatite crystals within intracytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles of histiocytes. Accumulation of apatite crystals and coalescense of calcified vesicles resulted in the formation of large laminated calcospherules. Extracellular Michaelis-Gutmann bodies and apatite crystal-containing matrix vesicles were also noted. Calcified vesicles and the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies were not observed in the phagolysosomes. Bacteria and viral particles were not identified. These findings suggest that matrix and intracytoplasmic membrane-bound vesicles play an important role in the initial stage of the formation of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies and that a mechanism other than bacterial or viral infection may be involved in cerebral malacoplakia.\r"

Markedly thickened gyri of the left inferior frontal, insular, and temporal cortex were found grossly. Microscopically, these gyri showed laminar disorganization and many unusually large and abnormally shaped ganglion cells. These neurons were heavily impregnated with silver preparations; were strongly reactive for neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and neuronal cytoskeletal proteins (68- and 200-kd subunits of neurofilament protein, microtubule-associated protein 2, and tau); and ultrastructurally contained numerous perikaryal neurofilaments. Collectively, these findings suggest that the abnormally large, misshapen neurons contained excessive accumulations of cytoskeletal intermediate filaments. The present case and a similar one described in 1964 are the only two documented instances of neuronal gigantism apparently related to therapeutic irradiation of the brain.\r"

In ELP, ultrastructurally amorphous fat accumulates in the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages. In AP, lamellar surfactant bodies with an electron microscopic complex structure are stored within alveolar lumina. In contrast to ELP, AP has not been associated with bronchial obstruction. One case of postobstructive AP occurred distal to a central carcinoid tumor, and two cases of combined AP and ELP occurred next to a squamous cell carcinoma that obstructed a lobar bronchus. Results of histologic and ultrastructural studies were determined with regard to new insights into the physiology and biochemistry of pulmonary lipids. It was concluded that the morphology of accumulated fat in obstructed lung tissue may depend on local oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions.\r"

An evident reactivity for lactoferrin was encountered in intestinal type carcinomas, adenomas, and incomplete intestinal metaplasia, whereas diffuse-type carcinomas, hyperplastic polyps, and complete intestinal metaplasia were always unstained; mucous neck cells of the antrum and body were also positive for lactoferrin. The results are discussed in relation to the increased requirement of iron by neoplastic cells, although in gastric carcinomas serum iron levels appear to be unrelated to the immunohistochemical presence of lactoferrin.\r"

Iron-free foci were found in siderotic macroregenerative nodules in liver cirrhosis. These foci were classic and overt carcinoma or borderline lesions showing an expansive growth pattern. Borderline lesions were composed of hyperplastic or small basophilic hepatocytes with hyperchromasia and distinct nuclear membrane showing pseudoglandular, trabecular, compact, and scirrhous patterns. These data suggest that iron stain is valuable for identification of neoplastic or borderline lesions representing a transition from hyperplastic nodule to carcinoma in human liver cirrhosis.\r"

The characteristic macroscopic feature of many of the histologically differentiated, minute and small EGCs was a depression accompanied by a circumferential elevation of the adjacent noncancerous mucosa. The circumferential elevation was carefully studied histologically. On the other hand, most of the undifferentiated-type minute EGCs included a proliferation of the malignant cells affecting the lamina propria in the middle layer of the mucosa, leaving noncancerous glands and foveolae, and therefore presenting no specific macroscopic change. Most of the undifferentiated-type small EGCs, however, manifested distinct depressions, with or without ulceration; these EGCs were histologically made up of a compact proliferation of carcinoma cells that destroyed both the foveolae and glands. These findings clearly showed the difficulty in detecting the undifferentiated type of minute EGCs and explained the increase in the frequency of the differentiated type in EGCs with a decrease of the size of clinically detectable EGCs. Topographic mapping of the EGCs revealed that the undifferentiated-type minute EGCs that occurred in the middle third of the stomach may well be overlooked.\r"

However, the significance of mucosal (MU) vs salivary gland (SG) involvement as well as the minimal histologic changes necessary for diagnosis remain unclear. We evaluated 68 lip and oral mucosa biopsy specimens using published diagnostic criteria. Thirty-four specimens contained both MU and SG tissue. Both MU and SG were definitely involved in 13 patients while apparent false-negatives for MU of 20% (2/10) and SG of 11% (1/9) were observed. No clinical differences were noted among the patients with both MU-alone-, or SG-alone-positive biopsy specimens. Patients with no evidence of cGVHD in either MU or SG showed significantly less other organ involvement than patients with positive evidence. Patients with minimal MU changes (rare dyskeratotic cells) were clinically indistinguishable from negative patients in terms of other organ involvement. However, 50% of the biopsy specimens with minimal MU involvement in which SG were present had definite GVHD in the SG. These data indicate that lip biopsy specimens must include both MU and SG tissue to rule out oral GVHD. Minimal MU changes are insufficient to diagnose oral cGVHD, although they do warrant close follow-up and a second biopsy if SG tissue is not present in the specimen.\r"

With in-house surgeons available, enthusiasm for direct transfer from the scene to the operating room (OR) has developed in many institutions. The purpose of this study was to define precisely which patients should be taken to the OR for resuscitation. Three hundred twenty-three patients were taken to the OR directly from the field during a 4-year period (6.9% of trauma activations). Indications included the following: (1) cardiac arrest--one vital sign present, (2) persistent hypotension despite field intravenous fluid, and (3) uncontrolled external hemorrhage. A board-certified surgeon and resuscitation team met the field transport team in the OR in all cases. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients with blunt trauma was not accompanied by survival even with immediate surgery by a trained surgeon and it wastes valuable OR resources. Patients with prehospital hypotension unresponsive to fluid resuscitation indicate the need for rapid surgery. Patients with blunt injuries even with hypotension infrequently undergo operations in less than 20 minutes and can be resuscitated in traditional areas where better roentgenograms are obtained. Penetrating injuries to the chest and abdomen with hypotension are the primary indications for OR resuscitation. It can be anticipated with field communication and accompanied by enhanced survival.\r"

In the 89 reoperations performed, the following six reasons or combination of reasons were responsible for the failed initial operation: (1) in 50 patients, there were multiple abnormal glands (30 hyperplastic and 20 second adenoma); (2) in 40 patients, the tumor was located in an ectopic position (22 mediastinal, 9 deep-seated cervical, 7 intrathyroidal, and 2 undescended); (3) in 17 patients, there were supernumerary parathyroid glands; (4) in 12 patients, the abnormal parathyroid glands were found in normal locations and the tumors were missed because of surgeon inexperience; (5) in 4 patients, failure was due to metastatic parathyroid cancer; and (6) in 4 patients, failure was due to errors on frozen section examinations. Preoperative localization studies usually identified the abnormal parathyroid tumor(s) prior to reoperations and were helpful in these patients. Knowledge of the reasons for failed parathyroid operations and the usual and unusual sites where parathyroid tumors are situated as well as a complete exploration should decrease the frequency of failed parathyroid operations. Localization studies are helpful for identifying these often elusive tumors.\r"

In 10 of these implanted swine, frequent focal point refocusing and biplanar ultrasonography were employed. Two animals served as operative controls. Fifteen other animals without gallstone implantation were studied for adverse effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on tissue. These animals (unimplanted) received 5000 shocks; 7 animals were killed 1 to 4 days after treatment and the others were killed after 4 weeks. Biochemical tests (total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase determinations) were performed on all animals at entry and every second or third day until they were killed. Successful fragmentation, defined as all residual gallstone fragments being less than or equal to 4 mm in greatest dimension, was achieved in 14 of 20 animals overall, but in 10 of 10 animals in which focal point refocusing had been used. Slight perivascular hemorrhage and minimal coagulation necrosis were seen histologically only in the liver parenchyma adjacent to the gallbladder bed. The remainder of the liver was grossly and histologically normal. No injuries to the colon, duodenum, common bile duct, or pancreas were observed. No alterations suggesting injury or altered function occurred in any of the biochemical tests.\r"

In 5 patients, obstructive symptoms had not yet developed and the diagnosis was made by endoscopy performed for evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux. Dysphagia had just started in 12 additional patients and no weight loss had been noted. The operation was palliative in 14 patients and potentially curative in the other 10. Only 3 patients had negative lymph nodes. Ten patients were alive after 2 to 11 years. Encouraging results were indicated for surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus developing in Barrett's epithelium. A good outcome can be obtained with resection even in patients with lymph node metastases.\r"

Fifty-three patients (80%) had immediate improvement in swallowing. Three patients required immediate redilatation, 2 developed pulmonary aspiration, and 8 (12%) suffered esophageal perforation. Esophageal perforation was treated by closure plus Heller's myotomy in 3 patients, closure only in 3, chest tube in 1, and antibiotics and nasogastric suction in 1. At 4 years' follow-up, 50% of patients who had dilatation remained asymptomatic, 30% had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, and 20% had persistent dysphagia. Eight Heller myotomies were performed, with excellent results in 7 and 1 postoperative death from respiratory failure. Seven additional patients with disabling esophageal symptoms after multiple operations for achalasia were ultimately treated by esophagectomy (n = 5), hemigastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy (n = 1), and repeated myotomy (n = 1). All recovered and are able to eat solid food. Thus, our experience indicates that pneumatic dilatation remains unperfected (ie, the line between undertreatment and overtreatment is finer than generally recognized), and unless improvements can be made, the role for surgery may need to be reexpanded.\r"

Gastric emptying was prospectively evaluated in 99 infants and children with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. Twenty-eight (28.2%) of 99 patients with gastroesophageal reflux had delayed gastric emptying. Twenty-one (75%) of the 28 patients underwent a concomitant gastric drainage procedure at the time of fundoplication. Seven had fundoplication alone and developed symptoms of early satiety, gas bloat, gagging, and pain postoperatively. Medical therapy was ineffective in these patients, and 5 improved after pyloroplasty. Delayed gastric emptying is common in patients with gastroesophageal reflux. These findings suggest that after fundoplication, symptoms of gagging, early satiety, and gas-bloat syndrome may be related to delayed gastric emptying. This implies that a gastric emptying study should be performed preoperatively.\r"

  ".W": "The gastric secretory status of 75 patients with abnormal esophageal exposure to gastric juice proved by 24-hour pH monitoring was measured to study the significance of gastric hypersecretion in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Gastric hypersecretion was a less-frequent finding than a mechanically defective sphincter (28% vs 72%, respectively). Forty-eight percent of patients with a normal sphincter, compared with 20% of those with a defective sphincter, were hypersecretors. In the presence of normal gastric secretion, complications occurred in 18% of those with a normal sphincter and 77% of those with a defective sphincter. In the presence of hypersecretion, the complication rate was 40% and 82%, respectively. These findings show that the development of reflux complications are related to a defective sphincter. Gastric hypersecretion in reflux patients with a normal sphincter is best treated by acid reduction using H2 blockers. Patients with a mechanically defective sphincter, regardless of their gastric secretory state, should have an antireflux procedure.\r"

Between 1977 and 1984, 537 consecutive patients received either a gastric bypass with a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, an unbanded gastrogastrostomy, or a vertical banded gastroplasty. The follow-up period was 5 years for all patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and unbanded gastrogastrostomy and 3 years for all patients who underwent vertical banded gastroplasty. Only 5.8% of all patients were unavailable for this late follow-up. The unbanded gastrogastrostomy was not an effective weight-control operation. Both the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and vertical banded gastroplasty provided effective long-term weight control. Although the Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy gave slightly better weight control than the vertical banded gastroplasty, the more simple, safe, and physiological vertical banded gastroplasty is the procedure of choice for most patients with morbid obesity.\r"

Colonic transit studies and anorectal manometry were applied to 12 women with severe constipation before subtotal colectomy. Delayed transit was noted in all patients with most exhibiting left-sided colonic arrest. Mean anal resting pressure and rectal capacity were similar to that in healthy controls. Pathologic examination results revealed decreased argyrophilic neurons in the colonic myenteric plexus. At 24 months postoperatively, all patients were satisfied with their results and mean (+/- SEM) weekly bowel movement frequency was 17 +/- 3 (compared with 0.8 +/- 0.2 preoperatively). Preoperative coloanal function studies therefore aid in the selection of patients who will be successfully treated by surgery. Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is the preferred operation because dysmotility can originate from either side of the colon.\r"

The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm in the adult population is 2% to 4%, and the incidence in a group of patients with carotid atherosclerosis has been reported to be 10%. This supports an association between the tortuous internal carotid artery and the abdominal aortic aneurysm independent of other risk factors. We found no significant difference in sex, age, or other atherosclerotic risk factors between those patients with and those without an abdominal aortic aneurysm. This suggests the possibility of weakness of the arterial wall as a cause of tortuous internal carotid artery and abdominal aortic aneurysm in this group of patients. Better histologic and biochemical definition of this possible weakness is warranted. From a clinical standpoint, we feel that the high association of the two conditions should not be ignored; patients found to have a tortuous internal carotid artery should be investigated and followed up carefully for the presence or subsequent development of aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta.\r"

There was an adequate function in the reconstructed venous segments in two of four who underwent thromboendvenectomy and in all four with ePTFE bypass grafting for nine months to 13 years after surgery. In those with a temporary arteriovenous shunt, prepared to maintain patency of the reconstructed venous segments, blood flow through the shunt exceeded 100 mL/min, determined by an electromagnetic flowmeter. Postoperative shunt closure was readily facilitated, using a looping technique and a 2-0 nylon. The increased blood flow through the graft made feasible by the temporary arteriovenous shunt enhanced the patency of the reconstructed venous graft and hence there was an improvement in the affected limb.\r"

Paraesophageal veins were divided into intra-abdominal and thoracoabdominal types, with the latter being further subdivided into right-side-predominant and left-side-predominant types. The existence of the thoracoabdominal paraesophageal veins was significantly related to the preoperative endoscopic findings of the red sign and the form of the esophageal varices. Left-side-predominant paraesophageal veins were likely to drain the splanchnic blood flow to the hemiazygos vein. The largest grade of red sign was found in 88.9% of the patients with combination of bar type and intra-abdominal type and the largest form was in 88.9% of those with palisading and right-side thoracoabdominal types. The pressure gradients across the shunt were significantly lower in the right thoracoabdominal type than in others. Our study suggests that treatment be designed according to the vascular patterns of the lower esophagus.\r"

Histologically, both PET groups appeared identical. An endothelialized neointima covered PET carotid specimens by six months, compared with three months in the aortic position, with greater pannus ingrowth in both PET groups.

We use two approaches to iliac arterial transposition that restore vascular continuity following long-segment iliac injuries. These techniques eliminate the need for any interposition graft. They also reconstruct with native arterial tissue of similar diameter and vascular characteristics as the injured vessel. We advocate the use of iliac arterial transposition to manage iliac arterial injuries whenever it is anatomically feasible.\r"

Closed endarterectomy is a substantial improvement over conventional open or half-closed endarterectomy. The closed endarterectomy takes less time, entails little or no blood loss, and is accomplished through a retroperitoneal approach. The aortofemoral bypass graft is inferior to the closed endarterectomy in morbidity, mortality, patency, and alleviation of impotence.

Previous studies have suggested that the paired forms are a manifestation of astrocytic proliferation and that the two nuclei of paired forms are in separate cells and have an equal (diploid) DNA complement. A model of hepatic encephalopathy can be produced using methionine sulfoximine to inhibit irreversibly the enzyme glutamine synthetase, resulting in elevated brain ammonia levels and development of Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Using this model Sprague-Dawley rats were simultaneously injected with methionine sulfoximine 300 mg/kg and tritiated thymidine 15 mCi/kg. Autoradiography of cerebral sections from animals killed 18 to 36 hours after the injection revealed many heavily labeled cortical Alzheimer type II astrocytic nuclei. These findings are consistent with DNA synthesis and mitotic division of Alzheimer type II astrocytes.\r"

Forty-nine patients with Down syndrome fit this criterion, with an average onset of dementia at 54.2 +/- 6.1 years. The prevalence of dementia in the institutionalized Down syndrome population of our study (n = 53) was 8% (2/25 patients) between 35 and 49 years, 55% (11/20 patients) between 50 and 59 years, and 75% (6/8 patients) of those over 60 years old.

Adequately treated hypothyroidism was present in 27 (59%) of 46 demented patients with Down syndrome tested. The average duration of dementia in the 23 patients who died was 4.6 +/- 3.2 years. Computed tomographic scans in 43 patients all showed brain tissue loss, most pronounced in the temporal lobes. Brains from 12 autopsied cases showed large numbers of plaques and tangles in the same locations as in persons with Alzheimer disease.\r"

We found three patients with severe atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of both internal carotid arteries who experienced brief loss of consciousness. Common characteristics were the absence of clinical or electroencephalographic seizure activities, significant cardiovascular disease, or a history suggestive of vasovagal syncope. Angiographically, the patients had widely patent vertebrobasilar circulation and collaterals from vertebrobasilar to carotid circulation. Episodic loss of consciousness disappeared after carotid endarterectomy. We concluded that bilateral hemispheric ischemia caused brief loss of consciousness, but selective focal ischemia in the subcortical structures superimposed on widespread bihemispheric ischemia may have been responsible. Since loss of consciousness is rare in carotid occlusive diseases, systemic and vertebrobasilar causes must be carefully ruled out in each instance.\r"

Unlike most other studies in which stroke was the most important cause of the movement disorder, in almost half (10 of 21) of our patients some other cause was found. Hemiballism-hemichorea was often the presenting feature of underlying medical disease. Besides the subthalamic nucleus, other subcortical structures may be involved in the pathogenesis of this hemihyperkinesia. While the movement disorder often improves spontaneously or with pharmacologic therapy, the underlying disease may result in serious consequences.\r"

This occurred in recordings from either cerebral hemisphere and at mean frequency-modulation depths ranging from +/- 20 to +/- 100 Hz. Pathophysiology of auditory mechanisms concerned with frequency-modulation analysis are particularly associated with receptive developmental language impairment and may underlie associated difficulties in speech perception.\r"

Patients were treated in a uniform manner and the overwhelming majority, 56 (94.9%) of 59 treated patients, initially responded to immunosuppressive therapy. The time for initial improvement was 1.9 +/- 3.6 months while the time to reach a clinical plateau was 6.6 +/- 5.4 months. The course was monophasic in 32 patients (53.3%) and relapsing in 28 (46.6%). Despite the initial responsiveness, only 24 (40%) of 60 patients are in partial or complete remission, receiving no medication. Two patients died. We were unable to identify specific clinical or laboratory features at the time of diagnosis that predicted outcome. Our data analysis, along with previous reports, suggests that chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy may be more heterogeneous than previously emphasized. In this light, we have proposed diagnostic criteria that allow for the heterogeneity but at the same time provide for a more consistent approach to better establish the natural history of this condition.\r"

Specific attention was paid to differentiation of the computed tomographic lesion site of the milder cases from the transcortical sensory aphasia cases. The critical lesion for transcortical sensory aphasia in these patients involved pathways in the posterior periventricular white matter adjacent to the posterior temporal isthmus, pathways that are probably converging on the inferolateral temporo-occipital cortex. Analysis of the language function of these patients, of the influence of sensory modalities on language function, and of the interaction between semantic memory and semantic lexical functions suggests the existence of a specific brain system for semantic functions. This semantic system has a particular distributed anatomy. We propose that damage to this system may have a variety of clinical manifestations in language and in memory, depending on the exact lesion configuration.\r"

The typical patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and neurosyphilis was young (mean age, 37 years) and male (83%). All had serological evidence of syphilis in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Syphilitic eye disease was surprisingly common in this group, occurring in 5 (42%). Four patients (33%) had been previously treated for syphilis. In 2, treatment for latent syphilis had been completed 3 and 5 months, respectively, before neurosyphilis was documented. Neurosyphilis is not uncommon in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in our population. In light of its diverse manifestations, syphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individual presenting with neurological, psychiatric, or ophthalmological disease.\r"

Declarative memory was assessed by testing recognition of the words used in mirror reading and a questionnaire concerning details of the previous testing session. Learning was evaluated on 3 consecutive days and a fourth session was scheduled after resolution of posttraumatic amnesia. Despite stable impairment of declarative memory during posttraumatic amnesia, the performance of head-injured patients improved across sessions on all procedural tasks and showed transfer to testing after resolution of posttraumatic amnesia.\r"

Results indicated that left ear suppression was found only in the MS patients with CCA. Likewise, patients in the MS group with CCA were slow in responding to stimuli presented in the left visual field; this effect was not observed in patients without CCA. These findings support the hypothesis that efficiency of cross-callosal information flow is reduced in MS patients with CCA.\r"

We present a patient with a parietal glioma and hyponatremia characterized by salt wasting and dehydration. Rehydration and sodium repletion corrected the sodium and volume deficits; withdrawal of supplemental sodium resulted in recurrence of dehydration and hyponatremia. We determined sodium and water balance and measured plasma atriopeptin, antidiuretic hormone, and aldosterone. Plasma atriopeptin ranged from 8 to 44 pg/mL (normal, less than 45 pg/mL); antidiuretic hormone was not elevated at 4 to 5 pg/mL, and aldosterone was slightly elevated at 1040.25 pmol/L. The concentrations of these hormones could not directly explain the natriuresis; interactions with neural or other humoral factors may be involved. In evaluating such patients, careful attention to sodium and water balance is important to guide appropriate therapy.\r"

Of the 607 eyes that satisfied the selection criteria, a preliminary chart review of outcomes found that 65 (10.7%) had proliferative vitreoretinopathy and 34 had macular puckers. From the remaining 508 eyes, 325 controls were randomly selected to match each case from within a time window. Thirty-six (55.4%) of the 65 patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy had had unequivocal reattachment after a single procedure before the onset of proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and the only clearly identified technical difficulty that was significantly more common in the patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy was the inability to identify a retinal break. Several other features of the rhegmatogenous retinal detachments that correlated with the development of postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy were identified, and stepwise discriminant analysis was used to ascertain which of these were more important. The strongest predictor was use of vitrectomy in management of the detachment. Following this in order of importance were the presence of preoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy, preoperative choroidal detachment, and the amount of cryopexy required. Vitrectomy remained a strong predictor even when considered after adjustment for all other characteristics. These data suggest that proliferative vitreoretinopathy is not simply an iatrogenic disease, but it is more likely to occur in association with certain detachment features that either by themselves or through their management require prolongation of the retinal wound healing process.\r"

Forty-seven (65.3%) of the 72 breaks were located on previous buckles, and 31 of these were on the posterior slope of the buckle. Twenty-nine (40.2%) of all new or previously unidentified breaks were on the border of a cryopexy-induced chorioretinal scar, and of these, 25 breaks (86%) were on the posterior slope of the buckle. Our results indicate that the retina that borders chorioretinal scars is vulnerable and prone to develop retinal tears secondary to traction from preretinal membranes. The vicinity of cryopexy-induced scars should be closely observed for retinal breaks in cases of recurrent retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "The current study was undertaken to assess the relationship of smoking to the risk of lens opacities. The risk was evaluated separately for nuclear and cortical opacities and for both types together. We studied 838 watermen in Maryland by detailed ocular examination for the presence and severity of each cataract type. All subjects were interviewed regarding smoking history, and a cumulative smoking dose was calculated. The results suggest a significantly increased risk of pure nuclear opacities associated with cigarette smoking. The increase in smoking dose was associated with increasing severity of nuclear opacity. The risk of nuclear opacities increased with increasing cigarette dose and decreased if the subject had quit smoking. The effect of smoking was most striking in those less than 80 years old. No increased risk of nuclear opacities was observed with earlier age when smoking started, after adjusting for dose and cessation of smoking. Further investigations are warranted on the biochemical and physical damage to the nucleus of the lens from smoking cigarettes.\r"

Hypopigmentation of the highly pigmented eyelids of the Saudi population was our most significant complication (8% of treated lids). Because cryotherapy is portable and cost-effective and can be administered by paramedical personnel, it is ideal for use in regions where trachoma is endemic.\r"

Despite the presence of diffuse rubeosis, 360 degrees peripheral anterior synechiae, and superior conjunctival scarring, it was possible to create a full-thickness defect from the anterior chamber angle to the subconjunctival space without operative complications. Six laser applications were required using 8 W of power per pulse and 0.1-second pulse duration. The eye was enucleated immediately after the laser procedure, prepared for light microscopy, and sectioned serially. Histologic analysis demonstrated a patent fistula approximately 300 microns in diameter with sharp wound margins. Tissue damage was localized to within 150 microns of the sclerostomy. The overlying conjunctiva was intact.\r"

Samples from the pure cultures and corneal scrapings were placed on glass slides, fixed, and incubated with one of a panel of 22 fluorescein-conjugated lectins. The slides were examined using an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescein-conjugated concanavalin A brightly stained both species of atypical mycobacteria, in both the pure culture and experimental keratitis samples. Several additional fluorescein-conjugated lectins (wheat germ agglutinin, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin, and Psophocarpus tetragonolobus agglutinin) brightly stained M chelonei, but only moderately stained M fortuitum. These staining patterns are consistent with the known carbohydrate compositions of the cell walls of atypical mycobacteria and suggest that fluorescein-conjugated lectins may be useful for the visualization of these organisms in corneal infections.\r"

Additional benefits of topical cyclosporine were reduced mucopurulent conjunctivitis, rapid healing of nonhealing corneal ulcers, and reduced dependence on frequent topical treatments of KCS. Twelve normal beagles treated with topical cyclosporine also had a reversible increase in lacrimation compared with baseline or placebo control-treated dogs.\r"

  ".W": "Intraocular gas bubbles can occlude retinal breaks and lead to retinal reattachment, but inferior breaks can be difficult to occlude. We hypothesized that an automated air injector connected to the eye would progressively fill the vitreous cavity with a bubble and occlude all, even inferior, breaks. This technique, termed continuous vitreous insufflation, was applied in 30 eyes of 15 rabbits using an air pressure of 50 mm Hg. Thirteen study eyes underwent lensectomy, vitrectomy, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment; 17 eyes did not. In each eye with a patent cannula, a bubble virtually filled the vitreous cavity within about 24 hours, and all detached retinas became reattached except those with large breaks. Because large bubbles should be effective in closing most breaks, continuous vitreous insufflation may enable high reattachment rates. Accordingly, this procedure may prove valuable in treating certain retinal detachments in humans, although there are obstacles to clinical application.\r"

In both age groups, antibodies to the basement membrane components laminin and collagen type IV were associated with blood vessels and laminar beam margins. In the adult eyes, interstitial collagen types I and III were heavily distributed within the laminar beams. Antibodies to fibrillin, the microfibrillar portion of elastin, labeled discrete, heavy bands oriented longitudinally within these beams. The beams of the neonatal lamina cribrosa contained much less interstitial collagen, with a predominance of collagen type III. Neonatal elastic tissue bands were less numerous and distinct within the laminar beams. These biochemical differences between the young and old lamina cribrosa may, in part, explain different clinical behaviors of the optic nerve head in congenital and adult glaucoma.\r"

The internal limiting lamina of the optic nerve has an extracellular composition similar to the thicker adjacent retinal internal limiting lamina. We confirmed that the lamina cribrosa contains type IV collagen and laminin, whereas the sclera does not. The septa of the retrolaminar optic nerve appear as vascular inward extensions of the pia mater. The glial tube that lines the optic nerve extends forward from the retrolaminar optic nerve through the lamina cribrosa to end anteriorly at the retinal pigment epithelium. It does not separate the optic nerve from the adjacent sensory retina.\r"

We have developed a method to noninvasively measure the optic nerve head displacement. In postmortem human glaucomatous eyes, the optic nerve head compliance decreased as the visual field worsened (n = 15, r = -.34). The mean difference between the optic nerve head displacement of the two eyes in subjects with symmetric clinical findings differed significantly from the mean in subjects with asymmetry. In the latter group, the lower value was always measured in the more affected eye. No significant correlation was found between age and the optic nerve head compliance. Overall, the results indicate that, in glaucoma, there is a stiffening of the mechanical support of the optic nerve head.\r"

On further examination in the first week of life at a screening clinic, 51 proved to have CDH, an incidence of 15.5 per 1000 births. The results confirmed the importance of established factors such as family history, caesarean section, and the breech position, and demonstrated the clinical significance of the presence of clicking hips on initial examination. After up to 4.1 years of follow-up there have been no late presentations. By taking into account the clinical examination by senior house officers, secondary screening of babies at high risk of CDH can be very effective. This extended high risk group may contain all potentially abnormal hips. All such babies should be examined by ultrasonography in hospitals where it is available.\r"

The reactivity towards the modified proteins was shown to be independent of the carrier protein as antibodies were reactive with modified human plasma proteins and modified bovine haemoglobin. The data presented here support the hypothesis that acetaldehyde-modified proteins may act as neoantigens in alcoholics and may play a role in the aetiology of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

Mice of these three strains showed mean ethanol intakes of 4.41, 1.76 and 0.77 g/kg/day respectively. Levels of the above brain monoamines did not change in the alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J mice, but in those with less preference for alcohol, C3H/He and DBA/2Cr, there were significant increases in DA and 5-HT levels respectively during the 4-week experiment. These findings suggest that inbred strains of mice show genetic differences of susceptibility to ethanol and that the strains with a low preference for alcohol undergo neurochemical changes after exposure to 10% ethanol and water even by free choice.\r"

We investigated various biochemical modifications occurring in the brain and the liver of pups born to alcohol-consuming rats. The parameters analysed were: superoxide dismutase, a protector against free radicals injury, enolase isoenzymes as markers of nerve cell maturation, glutamine synthetase involved in ammonia detoxification, alcohol and aldehyde deshydrogenases in order to evaluate the contribution of acetaldehyde teratogenicity and ATPase activities involved in ion and neurotransmitter transport. Activities of all these enzymes were decreased in the brain even when alcohol was withdrawn from the mother diet either during pregnancy or lactation. Activities were also decreased in the liver, except enolase and alcohol deshydrogenase activities, which were increased, suggesting possible adaptative events in the presence of alcohol. It seems likely that the multiple alterations observed in experimental fetal alcohol syndrome may be caused by free radicals following decreased superoxide dismutase activity in addition to the toxicity of alcohol and its metabolites.\r"

  ".U": "89334998\r", 
  ".W": "Functional tolerance to ethanol can be prolonged by administration of the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP), which acts at specific CNS receptors. AVP receptors in brain (lateral septum) have been shown to be localized, in part, presynaptically, and the mechanism of action of AVP may thus involve modulation of neurotransmitter release. AVP has also been found to increase the levels of mRNA for the cellular proto-oncogene, c-fos, in the septum and hippocampus. This response to AVP, which may be direct or indirect, may underlie the long-term neuroadaptive effects of the peptide. Studies with vasopressin antagonists have indicated a role for endogenous AVP in modulation of ethanol tolerance, and measurement of hypothalamic vasopressin mRNA by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization indicates that chronic ethanol ingestion may alter AVP synthesis. Tolerance to the aversive effects of ethanol has been postulated to influence alcohol drinking behavior in some individuals. Elucidation of the mechanism by which AVP affects ethanol tolerance may eventually lead to pharmacological means to modulate tolerance and, consequently, alcohol intake patterns.\r"

These consistent human and animal studies suggest that cholinergic challenges may be helpful in separating alcoholics from depressives.\r"

Fifty-five percent of these patients had ingested chewable multiple vitamins with iron and 40% had ingested nonchewable tablets. After radiographic review, radiopaque densities could be marginally visualized in only one case of ingestion of a chewable iron supplement. The mean serum iron level of patients who had ingested a chewable form of iron was 270 micrograms/dL. An in vitro study was performed to determine the radiopacity of various chewable multiple vitamins with iron. It was concluded that although chewable multiple vitamins with iron are radiopaque in vitro, clinical radiographic visualization is unlikely.\r"

Animals that were pretreated with diltiazem, nifedipine, or verapamil developed seizures significantly faster than controls, and at specific doses the death rate was higher than in controls for all three drugs. The potentiation of seizures and death by 2 mg/kg nifedipine pretreatment was further shown by challenge with three different doses of cocaine. This study fails to demonstrate a protective effect and suggests augmentation of cocaine toxicity by pretreatment with the three currently available calcium channel blockers. Several mechanisms by which calcium channel blockers may augment cocaine-induced toxicity are discussed.\r"

The ability of three clinical features--temperature, history of blood in the stool, and stool frequency--to predict the presence of bacterial gastroenteritis was analyzed. Over a 1-year period, 108 (10.4%) bacterial pathogens were isolated from 1,035 infants aged less than 1 year with diarrhea. Bacterial culture was positive in 14.9% of cases from May to October, compared with 6.2% of cases from November to April. A history of blood in the stool was the best individual predictor with sensitivity of 39%, specificity of 88%, and a positive predictive value of 30%. Temperature greater than 39 degrees C had sensitivity of 34% and specificity of 85%; greater than or equal to 10 stools in 24 hours had sensitivity of 28% and specificity of 85%. Using combinations of factors, we identified (1) a group of patients at high risk for bacterial diarrhea (infants with two of the three factors studied); (2) a low-risk group (those with temperature less than or equal to 38 degrees C, less than 10 stools in 24 hours, and the absence of blood in the stool); and (3) a group at intermediate risk for bacterial diarrhea (all other patients). We recommend routine stool cultures for infants with a high-risk combination. Additional clinical and laboratory features, such as stool leukocytes, should be studied among patients in the intermediate-risk group.\r"

An ECG taken shortly after the epinephrine administration showed widespread ischemia. Forty-five minutes later the tracing still showed an early repolarization pattern, but ST elevation was less marked and the patient was asymptomatic. Serum potassium was 3.2 mEq/L and serum catecholamines, drawn approximately 20 minutes after the epinephrine administration, were 10 times normal (dopamine, 173 ng/L; epinephrine, 1,628 ng/L; norepinephrine, 1,972 ng/L). There are seven other reports of intravenous epinephrine overdose in the English literature. Two of the previously reported cases had 12-lead ECGs within the first hour. In both there was evidence of transient ischemia similar to that observed in this case. Most of the patients had symptoms consistent with angina, and several developed pulmonary edema. These findings suggest that, in humans, large intravenous doses of epinephrine are likely to produce coronary artery spasm and may decrease coronary artery perfusion.\r"

Subjects with higher BMI had significantly higher systolic and diastolic pressure measured both noninvasively and invasively, P less than .02-.001. Baseline forearm blood flow (FABF) was substantially higher in the heavier subjects, P less than .02, whereas forearm vascular resistance (FAVR) levels were not different, P greater than .10. Despite the higher baseline forearm blood flow, the high BMI group displayed a greater rise in flow, P less than .01, in response to a regional phentolamine infusion, an index of vascular alpha-tone. Results of multiple regression analysis suggested that overweight was indirectly correlated with vascular alpha-tone via a relationship with arterial plasma norepinephrine concentration, a marker of sympathetic drive, and bumetanide-sensitive RBC Na+-K+ cotransport activity. These data indicate that in overweight men (1) higher FABF is not fully counter-balanced by lower FAVR; (2) increased vascular alpha-tone contributes to the altered flow-resistance relationship and thereby to the elevated blood pressure; and (3) greater sympathetic drive and Na+-K+ cotransport activity may explain the elevated vascular alpha-tone.\r"

Further, acute microinjection of clonidine into the AHA of SHR-S fed a high NaCl diet resulted in greater depressor and bradycardic responses than in SHR-S receiving a normal NaCl diet. The current study tested the hypothesis that the antihypertensive effect of chronic systemic administration of guanabenz (0.24 micrograms/kg/min, IV) is enhanced in SHR-S maintained on a high (8%) NaCl diet than in control rats on a normal (1% NaCl) diet. After two weeks on the diets, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured and blood for NE and epinephrine (E) assay was collected from intra-arterial cannulas in conscious, unrestrained rats. The ratio of left ventricle and septum to body weight (LV + S/BW) was determined. Chronic infusion of guanabenz significantly decreased MAP (P less than .05), HR (P less than .01) and LV + S/BW (P less than .01) in 8% NaCl fed SHR-S, but not in 1% NaCl fed SHR-S (P greater than .1).

Blood pressure was significantly elevated in SHR on 0.5% Ca2+ diets after both 6 and 12 weeks, as well as in WKY receiving 1% Ca2+. After six weeks on the diets for the SHR and 6 and 12 weeks for the WKY, serum-ionized Ca2+ was a function of the amount of Ca2+ in the diet. When contractile force generation in response tp KCl or norepinephrine was examined, small diet-related differences were detected, but no consistent linear effect associated with the level of Ca2+ in the diet was observed in either strain. When the sensitivity of the vessels to KCl and norepinephrine was examined, no effects of oral Ca2+ intake were detected. The results indicate that oral Ca2+ loading has modest effects on blood pressure at both 12 and 18 weeks of age in the SHR and WKY and in the younger rat, where Ca2+ intake modulates serum ionized Ca2+ levels. At no age does modification of Ca2+ intake have a consistent effect on mesenteric artery sensitivity or force-generating ability in response to KCl or norepinephrine. These findings do not support the hypothesis that oral Ca2+ loading lowers blood pressure in the rat by altering intrinsic contractile properties of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

The changes in arterial pressure at each of the time points during the three-hour infusion of AVP were not significantly different among the three groups. Cessation of the AVP infusion was associated with a dramatic and prolonged fall of arterial pressure below preinfusion basal levels in the Doca-salt hypertensive group: pressure was 58 +/- 5.0 mm Hg below basal levels within 60 minutes of stopping the infusion and was still 45 +/- 5.6 mm Hg below four hours later. Pressure in this group was 107 +/- 5.7 mm Hg five hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, the fall in pressure in the two control groups was small. Five hours after stopping the infusion, pressure was 108 +/- 2.3 mm Hg in the uninephrectomized group and 102 +/- 1.7 mm Hg in the sham-operated group.

Blood pressure was significantly higher in the 0.005% Ca and lower in the 2.8% Ca group respectively, compared with the control (1.4% Ca) group. Hypothalamic NE and DA were lower only in the 0.005% Ca group. DOPAC concentration was higher in both Ca-deficient and -excess groups. No change in HVA was observed in any group. Plasma Ca was reduced and parathyroid hormone (PTH) was increased in Ca-deficient groups, but plasma Ca and PTH were increased and decreased, respectively, (nondetectable) in the Ca-excess group. These results suggest that changes in BP due to altered dietary Ca metabolism may be due in part to altered adrenergic system, as well as to dietary-induced changes in calcium metabolism.\r"

In isolated perfused mesenteric vasculatures of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, Okamoto and Aoki strain, seven- to ten-weeks-old) and age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY), the effects of ouabain, a potent Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, or partially purified plasma obtained from salt-induced hypertension on pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow were investigated. Pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation were significantly greater in SHR than in WKY. Ouabain increased the stimulation-evoked pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow. This facilitation was more prominent in SHR than in WKY. Partially purified plasma obtained from reduced renal mass-salt hypertensive rats, which had a crossimmunoreactivity with digoxin, also increased the pressor responses and norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation, and the effects were greater in SHR than in WKY. These results suggest that Na+,K+-ATPase on vascular adrenergic neurons has an important role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release, and that its activity might be enhanced in SHR.\r"

  ".U": "89335288\r", 
  ".W": "In chronic hypertension, the lower limit of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is shifted towards high blood pressure with a consequent impairment of the tolerance to acute hypotension. Despite this, antihypertensive treatment in the great majority of patients prevents stroke and the risk for treatment-induced cerebral ischemia is only real in a limited number of clinical settings such as malignant hypertension, hypertension in the elderly, and hypertension associated with acute stroke. During long-term treatment adaptive hypertensive changes in CBF autoregulation may be reversible, especially in young patients. Drugs used for emergency lowering of blood pressure may be classified into four groups according to their effect on CBF and intracranial pressure: (1) drugs with no pharmacological action in the cerebral circulation; (2) cerebral vasodilators; (3) alpha-adrenergic and ganglionic blockers; and (4) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Oxygen saturation in the jugular venous blood is of the order of 60% to 70% and is considerably higher than in the coronary sinus. It is hypothesized that this oxygen reserve enables the brain better than the heart to take hemodynamic advantage of pressure lowering without risking tissue ischemia. This may explain why antihypertensive treatment prevents stroke but not myocardial infarction. Acute hypertensive encephalopathy is probably caused by failure of autoregulatory vasoconstriction with focal or generalized dilatation of small arteries and arterioles. This is associated with a high CBF, dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, and the formation of brain edema that is thought to cause the clinical symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "89335291\r", 
  ".W": "Abnormalities in sodium transport in red blood cells (RBC) have been reported in hypertensive subjects. Uncertain from previous studies is whether the level of sodium intake per se might influence the level of these transporters. This study was designed to answer that question by evaluating the level of activity of three RBC sodium transporters in fourteen normotensive and twenty-six hypertensive subjects studied twice--once while in balance on a 10 mEq and once while in balance on a 200 mEq sodium intake. There was no significant difference in the maximal velocity (Vmax) of the sodium pump or the cell sodium and potassium content in normotensive or hypertensive subjects, nor did sodium intake influence these factors. Li-Na countertransport activity was significantly (P less than .01) higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive subjects. However, sodium intake did not influence the Vmax of this transporter in either group. In contrast, sodium efflux through the Na-K-Cl cotransporter was significantly influenced (P less than .03) by the level of sodium intake, but only in the hypertensive subjects. On the high sodium intake, both the Km and the Vmax were significantly elevated (P less than .03) compared to their levels on the low sodium diet. Additionally, only on the high salt diet did hypertensives have significantly higher levels of activity than normotensives (P less than .03). Thus, Na-K-Cl cotransport activity is influenced by the level of sodium intake, suggesting that caution needs to be exercised in interpreting the level of activity of this transporter unless the level of sodium intake is fixed and known.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms of hypotensive action of antihypertensive drugs were theoretically considered using the water tank model on body fluid volume-blood pressure regulation. If a cock is attached to a tank with a base area corresponding to the reciprocal of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and water is poured into this tank at a rate corresponding to the amount of Na+ intake, then equilibrium should be achieved at a certain water level, volume, and output from the cock, which represent mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO), and urinary Na+ excretion rate. The height of the cock from the tank bottom and the size of the cock correspond to the x-intercept and slope of the renal function curve (pressure-natriuresis relationship). Vasodilators lowered the cock height and enlarged the base area (reduced TPR), resulting in an increase in the volume (CO). beta-Blockers not only lowered the height, but also decreased the size of the cock. Because they do not alter TPR (base area), CO (volume) must be reduced. Converting-enzyme inhibitors had the same effects on the height and size of the cock as beta-blockers, but enlarged the base area (reduced TPR), resulting in an increase in the volume (CO). Diuretics increased the cock size without affecting the cock height or the base area, resulting in a decrease in CO. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on the cock (kidney) seemed essential in their hypotensive action, similarly as abnormality of the renal function curve is essential in the genesis of hypertension. These analyses can illustrate schematically the hemodynamic changes induced by antihypertensive drugs.\r"

After four weeks open treatment with HCTZ 50 mg/d, 20 patients were blindly allocated to receive placebo and 20 to receive amlodipine, if their diastolic arterial pressure supine and upright was 95 to 115 mm Hg. The patients were seen in the clinic every two weeks for 12 more weeks, where their arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) were measured supine and upright. Hydrochlorothiazide was kept at 50 mg/d, but amlodipine was increased from 2.5 to 5.0 to 10.0 mg/d as needed. At end of weeks 4 and 16 the AP and HR were measured hourly for 12 hours and 24 hours later. Serial clinical and laboratory evaluations including lipid profiles were done on all patients. Amlodipine treated patients had lower arterial pressures in both the supine and upright positions (P less than .001), higher HDL levels (P less than .05) and lower CHOL:HDL and LDL:HDL ratios (P less than .01), than placebo-treated patients. Also, amlodipine-treated patients had lower SGOT and SGPT levels (P less than .01) than placebo-treated patients. No changes in HR or weight were noted between the two groups of patients. Clinical side effects were few and mild and not different between the two groups. We conclude: (1) the addition of amlodipine to HCTZ enhanced its antihypertensive action; (2) amlodipine was safe and well tolerated; and (3) amlodipine, perhaps, has a favorable effect on lipids.\r"

In this study, we used a rat preproenkephalin A complementary DNA to determine whether proenkephalin A-derived peptides participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension as reflected by brain regional messenger RNA levels. Complementary DNA clones of the rat preproenkephalin A mRNA and rat small myelin basic protein mRNA were hybridized to total RNA extracted from hypothalamus, pons-medulla, thoracic cord, midbrain, and cerebellum of 3 1/2-week-old and 12-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. In 3 1/2-week and 12-week animals there were no differences in the levels of myelin basic protein messenger RNA between the two groups in any brain region. At 3 1/2 weeks, preproenkephalin A mRNA levels did not differ between normotensive and hypertensive strains. In contrast, at 12 weeks preproenkephalin A mRNA levels were increased in hypothalamus, midbrain, thoracic cord, and cerebellum of SHR relative to WKY. Preproenkephalin A mRNA was significantly reduced in the pons-medulla of SHR relative to WKY. Our findings provide evidence that alterations in brain regional preproenkephalin A mRNA levels are associated with the development of spontaneous hypertension in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "There is a great need to discover traits that predict future human hypertension. Our previous studies found abnormal glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) in isolated kidneys of Dahl S rats. Such GFR alterations were sought in intact, low NaCl, prehypertensive Dahl S rats. Such Dahl S rats are genetically susceptible to NaCl hypertension but are normotensive on low NaCl. On .3% low NaCl, BP of 12 Dahl S rats averaged 138 mm Hg v 131 in 12 Dahl R rats (NS). Glomerular filtration rates under inactin anesthesia were measured during two 20-minute periods before a 20-minute amino acid infusion and also during three 20-minute periods after the amino acid infusion. Before the amino acid infusion, GFRs averaged 3.3 mL/min in S rats v 3.25 in R rats (NS). After the amino acid infusion, R rats showed a progressive rise in GFR: 4.7, 5.1 and 5.4 in three successive 20-minute periods. In these same three periods after amino acids, the S rats had GFRs of 3.8, 3.8, and 3.8. Thus R rats had an 81% increase of GFR after amino acids, whereas S rats increased only 18%, a 78% lower increase, P less than .001. The R rats had the normal rise of GFR in response to an amino acid load. Prehypertensive S rats had virtually no increase in GFR after the amino acid infusion. Even though both S & R rats had BPs well within the normal range, the ability to increase GFR after amino acid infusion was markedly impaired in prehypertensive S rats. This defect could possibly be used to predict future hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The main determinants of intramyocardial current flow during transthoracic countershock are the selected energy and the transthoracic impedance of the patient. To optimise the success of the first shock and to titrate energy dosage according to each patient's transthoracic impedance, a microprocessor controlled current based defibrillator was developed. It was compared with a conventional energy based protocol of 200 J (delivered energy), 200 J, then 360 J if required in 42 consecutive episodes of ventricular fibrillation in 33 men and seven women. The mean (SD) predicted transthoracic impedance was 69.9 (14.0) omega. First shock success with the standard protocol was 80.9%, and first or second shock success was 95.2%. The microprocessor controlled current based defibrillator automatically measured transthoracic impedance and calculated the energy required to develop a selected current in each patient. A current protocol of 30 A, 30 A, then 40 A, if required, was used in 29 men and 12 women with 41 episodes of ventricular fibrillation. Transthoracic impedance (mean 65.1 (15.9) omega) was similar to that in the energy protocol group and success rates for first shock (82.9%) and first or second shocks (97.5%) were also similar. The mean delivered energy per shock with the current based defibrillator for first or second shock success was significantly less (144.8 J) with the energy protocol (200 J). The mean peak current of successful shocks was also significantly reduced (29.0 v 31.9 A). A current based defibrillator titrates energy according to transthoracic impedance; it has a success rate comparable to conventional defibrillators but it delivers significantly less energy and current per shock.\r"

Blood pressure and concentrations of plasma catecholamines did not change. The median end diastolic and end systolic volumes of the left ventricle increased by 41% so that the left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged. There were no significant changes during the control experiments. In healthy people a meal caused an appreciable increase in stroke volume and dilatation of the left ventricle. The activity of the sympathetic nervous system, as measured by plasma catecholamines, did not change much, and changes in blood volume alone did not seem to explain the haemodynamic response to the meal.\r"

The mean ventricular rate was 94 beats per minute with a mean QT interval of 357 ms. The mean QTc, corrected beat by beat with Bazett's formula, was 444 ms--longer than reported for sinus rhythm. Between subjects, the mean QT interval was linearly related to the mean RR interval, with a slope of +21%. Within all 50 recordings there was a statistically significant correlation between QT intervals and immediately preceding RR intervals, with an average slope of +7%. This within subject QT/RR interval slope was greater at faster mean ventricular rates. In atrial fibrillation, as in sinus rhythm, the QT interval is a function of both the mean ventricular rate and the instantaneous ventricular rate, with the mean ventricular rate predominating; a simple correction of QT intervals for heart rate is therefore inadequate. Comparison of uncorrected QT intervals with those of earlier published series of people in sinus rhythm, however, suggested that atrial fibrillation is associated with prolongation of the mean QT interval.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and a history of reduced exercise tolerance in cold weather (cold intolerance) underwent symptom limited treadmill exercise tests at 20 degrees C and 0 degrees C in a specially constructed cold chamber while taking no antianginal medication. Their mean time to onset of angina (5.8 v 4.2 min), to 1 mm ST depression (5.1 v 3.8 min), and to peak exercise (7.4 v 5.7 min) was significantly shorter on exercise at 0 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The double product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure at each of these end points was the same in both exercise tests. Eight of these patients were treated with nifedipine 10 mg three times a day for two weeks and then with propranolol 40 mg three times a day for another two weeks. Repeat exercise testing was performed at the end of each two week treatment period. The mean time (SD) to peak exercise at the end of the nifedipine treatment period was 9.1 (2.0) min at 20 degrees C and 8.5 (2.3) min at 0 degrees C. The double product at peak exercise was the same for both exercise tests. At the end of the propranolol treatment period the mean time to peak exercise was significantly less at 0 degrees C (7.8 (2.6) min) than at 20 degrees C (8.9 (2.4) min). The double product at peak exercise was the same for both exercise tests but was significantly less than that on nifedipine. Cold intolerance was shown in patients with a positive history by symptom limited treadmill exercise testing at 0 degrees C. It persisted when they were treated with propranolol, albeit to a lesser extent, but not when they were treated with nifedipine.\r"

A patient is described in whom pulmonary oedema developed after delivery of her first child by caesarean section 13 months previously. Subsequent cardiac catheterisation showed severe mitral stenosis (valve area 0.96 cm2, valve gradient 12 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 30/16 mm Hg). Before valvotomy could be performed the patient again became pregnant and presented in pulmonary oedema at twenty two weeks' gestation. Medical treatment was unsuccessful and she underwent percutaneous transluminal balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. This increased the valve area to 1.78 cm2 and reduced the transmitral gradient to 6 mm Hg. The procedure was uncomplicated, and she remained symptom free on no medication. She delivered vaginally at 37 weeks' gestation. Percutaneous transluminal balloon dilatation of the mitral valve is a safe and effective alternative to mitral valvotomy in pregnancy.\r"

Sixteen (16%) in the aortic and 24 (25%) in the mitral position were associated with clinical signs of regurgitation. A phased array system (Hewlett-Packard A77020A) with a 2.5 MHz duplex and 1.9 MHz continuous wave transducer was used. Colour flow mapping showed trivial transvalvar regurgitation in 23 (53%) metal aortic prosthesis, and only nine (20%) metal mitral prostheses. This difference was probably attributable to shielding of the left atrium by the metal components. Colour mapping confirmed abnormal regurgitation in all aortic prostheses with early diastolic numbers, but regurgitation was also shown in 25 (29%) with no diastolic murmur. Abnormal mitral regurgitation was found in 13 (54%) patients with a pansystolic murmur, but also in six (8%) with no systolic murmur. Two patients, thought on clinical grounds to have mild mitral regurgitation, had unexpectedly large jets on colour flow mapping. About one in three prostheses had paraprosthetic leaks, 65 (79%) of which were small with a jet area less than 20% of the area of the receiving chamber. The development of new paraprosthetic leaks led to the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis in two patients. In eight patients regurgitation was first diagnosed with continuous wave Doppler, but was afterwards shown with colour mapping and in a further 10 regurgitation could only be shown by continuous wave Doppler.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Logistic regression was used to calculate a score, based on a combination of age, cholesterol, and hypertension, that separated current smokers from lifetime non-smokers. When this function was applied to ex-smokers, only those who had given up at least 15 years before the attack had a risk factor profile similar to that of non-smokers. Those who had given up less than five years before the ischaemic attack had a significantly higher level of other risk factors than current smokers; those who had stopped for between five and 15 years had levels similar to those of current smokers. Ex-smokers are at higher risk of acute coronary disease for at least 15 years after stopping, but some immediate reduction in risk is possible.\r"

Although data on haemodynamic function at rest may indicate impaired cardiac function, they do not assess the capacity of the heart to respond to stress. Maximal bicycle ergometry and incremental intravenous inotropic stimulation in 31 patients with moderately severe heart failure were evaluated as methods of stressing the heart to determine cardiac pumping capability, which is defined as the cardiac power obtained during maximal stimulation. There was good agreement between the cardiac pumping capabilities assessed by these two methods. Maximal cardiac power output was better than maximal cardiac output and left ventricular stroke work index in representing cardiac pumping capability, because it was less dependent on the type of stimulation used during evaluation. Inotropic challenge is at least as effective as exercise testing in assessing cardiac pumping capability in heart failure, and may be a better method in patients who find physical exercise difficult.\r"

  ".W": "The correlation between intracavitary thrombosis detected by cross sectional echocardiography and systemic embolism was studied in 126 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who were examined from January 1980 to September 1987. A total of 1041 serial echocardiograms were obtained with 3.5 and 5 MHz transducers. The mean follow up period was 41.2 months. The survival rate was 88% at two years and 56% at five years. Echocardiography showed intracavitary thrombi in 14 (11.1%) patients; 13 were mural and 11 were localised at the apex of the left ventricle. Twelve patients (8.4%) had systemic emboli; this corresponded to an incidence of new embolic events of 1.4 for 100 patient-years. Patients with intracavitary thrombi or systemic emboli were treated with oral anticoagulants, as were nine in functional class IV of the New York Heart Association, for 61 patient-years. The cumulative observation period for the whole population study was 418 patient-years. None of the patients with intracavitary thrombosis had embolic complications and none of those with embolism had intracavitary thrombi. Rates of intracavitary thrombosis and systemic embolism in this series were low and there was no overlap between the two events. This may have been because the patients did not have severe dilated cardiomyopathy, because echocardiography did not detect all the thrombi, or because patients were treated with oral anticoagulants. The presence of intracardiac thrombosis detected by cross sectional echocardiography is not predictive of systemic embolism in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Criteria for the use of the anticoagulant treatment remain largely empirical in these cases.\r"

To investigate the nature of diurnal variation in pulmonary artery pressure in chronic heart failure, eight angina-free men (aged 50-72 years) with treated chronic heart failure caused by ischaemic heart disease underwent continuous ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure recording by a transducer tipped catheter. The mean (1 SD) daytime pulmonary artery pressure was 29.6 (5.0) mm Hg systolic and 13.7 (5.6) mm Hg diastolic. The mean change in pressure from day to night was +5.1 (3.2) mm Hg systolic and +3.8 (1.7) mm Hg diastolic; and the mean change from standing to lying +9.3 (2.3) mm Hg systolic and +6.4 (2.1) mm Hg diastolic. In six of the eight patients there was considerable rise in pulmonary artery pressure at night, but in the two patients with the most severe symptoms there was no nocturnal rise. In patients with chronic heart failure, nocturnal pulmonary artery pressure is not determined by postural change alone. But interpretation of isolated pulmonary artery pressure measurements must take the posture of the patient into account.\r"

The patients studied had a wide range of congenital heart defects with 19 patients having isolated multiple ventricular septal defects, three with associated tetralogy of Fallot, five with double outlet right ventricle, three with complete transposition and ventricular septal defect, and one with a complete atrioventricular septal defect. In 23 patients the defects were inspected at operation. Cross sectional imaging with integrated pulsed and continuous wave Doppler correctly identified multiple defects in only 12 (39%) patients. In contrast, colour flow imaging was accurate in 24 (77%) patients and left ventriculography in 20 (65%) patients. When patients were subdivided on the basis of relative peak systolic ventricular pressures into restrictive defects (18 patients) and non-restrictive defects (13 patients) the diagnostic value of colour flow imaging was different for each group. Colour flow mapping correctly identified multiple ventricular septal defects in 16/18 (89%) patients with restrictive defects but only 8/13 (62%) with non-restrictive defects. The comparative diagnostic accuracy of left ventriculography was 15/18 (83%) in the restrictive group and 5/13 (38%) in the non-restrictive group. Colour flow imaging was the single investigative technique with the greatest diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of multiple ventricular septal defects.

The results obtained were compared with those obtained at cineangiography and at operation. Multigated pulsed Doppler examination of a stenosed valve showed a region of relatively high velocities in the velocity profile (jet flow). There was good agreement between the diameter of the disturbed region on the Doppler echocardiogram and the diameter of the jet on the lateral angiocardiogram. In severe valve stenosis the agreement between the valve diameters measured by multigated pulsed Doppler and at operation was also good. In less severe valve stenosis Doppler measurements systematically underestimated the valve diameter at operation. It is likely that the functional opening of a semilunar valve is a more relevant estimate of the degree of stenosis than the anatomical measurement of the orifice. The findings of this study indicate that multigated pulsed Doppler systems are useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of stenotic valve disease.\r"

Previous studies indicate that cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) might be implicated in the action of synthetic retinoids. We, therefore, compared the three retinoids for their ability to increase epidermal CRABP levels after systemic and topical treatment. Oral treatment with acitretin and Ro137410 led to a striking increase of epidermal CRABP (from 2.6 +/- 0.9 to 16.2 +/- 2.9, P less than 0.004 and from 2.5 +/- 1.2 to 21.5 +/- 3.4 pmol/mg protein, P less than 0.004, respectively), while isotretinoin failed to induce a comparable rise (3.2 +/- 1.6 before and 3.7 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg protein after treatment), although it displayed in all patients a striking sebostatic effect. After topical application, the increase of CRABP was comparable for all three compounds. The interaction of isotretinoin with the epidermis seems to be different from other synthetic retinoids only after systemic treatment, a finding that parallels clinical observations.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with localized morphoea have an increased incidence of auto-immune disorders, but this is not related to the age of onset, duration of disease nor the site or number of lesions. The patients have an increased incidence of tissue antibodies and these are more common when more than one lesion is present. The relatives of the patients have also been found to have an increased incidence of auto-immune disorders. These findings suggest an immunological basis for the disease and indicate that the patients should be investigated and followed up to detect the evidence of other auto-immune disorders.\r"

Oestradiol was measured in the males. Free T and free DHT were calculated. Acne was graded on three sites and the sebum excretion rate (SER) was measured in most patients. With the possible exception of free DHT, none of the plasma steroids or SHBG correlated with acne severity or with SER. Free DHT in the females showed a possible, but weak, correlation with total acne (r = 0.25, P = 0.07), but comparison with male data showed that this was not causative. The role of androgens in acne is permissive and plasma androgen measurements usually have no place in its management.\r"

  ".W": "There are few methods for assessment of the efficacy of barrier cream preparations that can be used in vivo. This paper describes two such tests. The first relies on the ability of a topically applied barrier preparation to prevent dyes from reaching the stratum corneum from filter paper discs in small aluminium chambers. The amount of dye crossing the barrier cream and reaching the stratum corneum was assessed by removing the superficial layers by skin surface biopsy and eluting out the dye. The second test employed dilutions of sodium hydroxide as indicator reagents. The degree to which these solutions penetrated the barrier on the skin was assessed by measuring the skin blood-flow using the laser Doppler method. It was concluded that both methods could be usefully employed to assess the degree of efficacy of barrier cream preparations.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of UVB phototherapy and low-dose acitretin (0.34-0.44 mg/kg body weight) was compared with the effect of acitretin alone and UVB phototherapy alone in 41 patients with plaque-type psoriasis. Of these patients, 32 received standard UVB phototherapy without acitretin. The other nine were treated with acitretin and the effect of UVB irradiation (Sylvania UV 21-tubes), applied to one half of the body, was assessed. Clearance was defined as 80-100% improvement and this occurred in eight out of the nine patients (89%) treated with acitretin-UVB (ReUVB) and, in two of them (23%), on the untreated side. Clearance occurred in 20 of the 32 (62.5%) patients given UVB alone. The improvement score was significantly higher for the ReUVB side than the acitretin side. Patients treated with ReUVB showed a statistically higher therapeutic score (95-100% clearance) than those receiving UVB alone. However, taking 80-100% improvement as the criterion, no significant difference was found. The number of treatments to clearance was significantly less for the patients treated with ReUVB than for the UVB (19.3 as compared with 24.9). The total UVB dose and the number of minimal erythema doses (MEDs) could be reduced by approximately 20% in the ReUVB group relative to the UVB group.\r"

Affected individuals were not clinically photosensitive, but their fibroblasts demonstrated gross cytopathic changes, low survival indices and an increased frequency of DNA single strand breaks following exposure to long-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVA). These clinical and cellular features appear to identify an unrecognized syndrome that may not be uncommon. Recognition of this syndrome in a family may prevent certain malignancies developing in those affected.\r"

By contrast, family members without NSSCL had normal lipid levels. There was also a correlation between the degree of hyperlipidaemia and the amount of subcutaneous lipomas. The occurrence of hyperlipidaemia in family members with NSSCL suggests the existence of a genetic linkage between these two characteristics, but did not show any association with HLA haplotyping. To our knowledge this association between lipid abnormalities and NSSCL has not been previously reported.\r"
