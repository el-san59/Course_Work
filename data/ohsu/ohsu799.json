  ".W": "Previously we established that an acute inflammatory response in the upper respiratory tract of humans could be studied by analyses of nasal lavages (NL). The relationship of these cellular responses to responses in the lower lung has not been thoroughly investigated in humans. In this study we have compared the cellular changes detected in NL with those detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) taken from the same individual. A group of 10 subjects was exposed to either filtered air or 0.4 ppm ozone (O3), with exercise, for 2 h. The NL was done prior to, immediately following, and 18 h postexposure; the BAL was done only at 18 h postexposure. A significant increase in PMN was detected in the NL immediately postexposure to O3 (7.7-fold increase; p = 0.003) and remained elevated in the 18 h post-O3 NL (6.1-fold increase; p less than 0.001). A similar increase in PMN was detected in the BAL 18 h after exposure to O3 (6.0-fold increase; p less than 0.001). The albumin levels in the NL and BAL were also similarly increased 18 h after O3 (3.9-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively). Although a qualitative correlation in the mean number of PMN existed between the upper and lower respiratory tract after O3, comparison of the NL and BAL PMN from each individual showed a significant quantitative correlation for the air data (r = 0.741; p = 0.014) but not for the O3 data (r = 0.408; p = 0.243). This study demonstrates that PMN counts in the NL can be a useful, inexpensive means of studying the acute inflammatory effect of ozone and monitoring those effects in the lower lung.\r"

  ".W": "This study was carried out to determine leukocyte phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels in normal subjects and in patients with asthma and rhinitis and to examine their relationship to airway sensitivity to histamine. Leukocyte PLA2 activity and plasma LPC levels were highly correlated (rs = 0.90), and were found significantly raised in both the disease groups, more so in the asthmatics. Both PLA2 activity and LPC levels showed overall negative correlations with the log dose of histamine producing a 35% fall in specific airway conductance (PD35 histamine) when the patients and the normal subjects were examined together (rs = -0.77 and rs = -0.83, respectively). The patients with leukocyte PLA2 activity more than 1.8 U (nmol 14C-AA released/mg protein/10 min at 30 degrees C) or plasma LPC levels more than 8.7% of total phospholipids (mostly asthmatics) showed high airway sensitivity to histamine (PD35 histamine less than or equal to 1 mg/ml). On the other hand, the PD35 histamine values of patients with leukocyte PLA2 activity equal to or less than 1.96 U or plasma LPC levels equal to or less than 8.7% overlapped with those of normal subjects in the range of 1.2 to 10 mg/ml. Lowering of plasma LPC levels, which probably reflect tracheobronchial LPC content as shown in guinea pigs, seems to be an essential step in the return of airway reactivity toward normal.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of ferrets with influenza A virus results in a disease syndrome that is similar to that observed in humans. To examine the pathophysiology of this disease, ferrets were challenged with either H1N1 influenza virus or placebo. Sign scores and rectal temperatures were recorded periodically during the 9 days after infection. Nasal lavages were also collected during this time period and the content of kinins, histamine, cells, and total protein in these lavages was assessed. In infected animals (n = 17) compared to healthy controls (n = 14), sign scores were first significantly elevated at 30 h postinfection. Sign scores peaked at 48 to 72 h postinfection and then slowly declined, although they remained significantly elevated up to 168 h postinfection. Kinin levels were significantly correlated with signs. Associated with increased sign scores and kinins, elevations were observed in the levels of total protein and cells in nasal lavages of infected animals. In contrast to the increases in kinin levels that were observed during influenza infections, histamine concentrations in nasal lavages did not change in response to infection. We conclude that kinins are generated in nasal secretions during influenza A infections and that these potent vasoactive peptides may contribute to the symptomatology of such infections. The study of influenza infections in ferrets provides a convenient animal model in which to evaluate further the role of kinins in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections.\r"

In the Ach-exposed animals, the smooth muscle in the respiratory units (alveolar mouth of the alveolar duct) as well as in the peripheral airways was increased. The internal and external diameters of the peripheral airways were not significantly different between Ach-exposed and control animals. In addition, the Ach-exposed animals had higher specific diaphragm weights (diaphragm to body weight). We conclude that recurrent asthmalike breathing brings about increased smooth muscle, but the increased muscle contributes little to airway dimensions. We speculate that an increased airway wall thickness inside the outermost layer of smooth muscle may play a role in increasing airway reactivity.\r"

  ".W": "We examined whether acute exposure to a low dose of cigarette smoke causes an increase in airway responsiveness in guinea pigs and whether the changes in airway responsiveness are accompanied by increased vascular permeability or neutrophil influx in the trachea. Animals were divided into four groups: groups exposed to 5, 10, or 20 puffs of cigarette smoke and a control group. Airway responsiveness was assessed by measuring specific airway resistance (SRaw) as a function of increasing concentration of inhaled methacholine (Mch) aerosol immediately, 5 h, and 24 h after exposure. In parallel studies, tracheal vascular permeability was quantified by measuring the tracheal extravasation of intravenously administered Evans blue dye, and neutrophil influx into the tracheal mucosa was quantified by counting cells within whole mounts of tracheas that were stained with Giemsa. Exposure to 5 puffs of cigarette smoke caused no changes in airway responsiveness. Exposure to 10 puffs induced airway hyperresponsiveness only immediately after exposure. Exposure to 20 puffs induced airway hyperresponsiveness not only immediately but also 5 h after exposure. There was a significant correlation between the dose (puffs) of cigarette smoke and increase in airway responsiveness immediately after exposure (r = 0.77; p less than 0.001). The tracheal extravasation of intravenously administered Evans blue dye and the number of neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa did not differ significantly from the corresponding control values at any time or in any exposed group. Furthermore, none of these changes was observed in the airways distal to the trachea of any animal immediately after exposure to 20 puffs of cigarette smoke.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine whether a respirable fraction of cotton dust could produce emphysema in an animal model, we intratracheally instilled hamsters with respirable cotton dust particles (0.75 mg/100-g animal), mass median aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 4.8 microns, twice weekly for 6 wk. We also examined whether instilled endotoxin (255 micrograms/100-g animal) could produce emphysema in hamsters and whether cellulose (0.75 mg/100-g animal) is an appropriate inert comparison dust. A saline-instilled group was the control. Hamsters were killed 8 wk after the last instillation. Static pressure-volume deflation curves of air-filled excised lungs were analyzed to measure lung distensibility. Lungs were fixed in inflation using glutaraldehyde and were examined morphometrically to obtain surface area and numbers of granulomata. Endotoxin-treated animals had increased distensibility, reduced surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio, and morphologically apparent mild centrilobular emphysema. Cellulose-treated animals had decreased distensibility, normal S/V ratio, and significant numbers of granulomata with patchy areas of thickened interalveolar septa. Cotton-dust-instilled animals had normal distensibility, reduced S/V ratio, significant numbers of granulomata, and mild centrilobular emphysema. These data suggest that cotton dust produces a significant parenchymal lesion with elements similar to both the emphysematous response to endotoxin and the fibrotic nodular response to cellulose.\r"

Medical records of 127 patients with adenosquamous lung carcinoma were reviewed to determine the clinical features, namely, age, race, sex, smoking history, asbestos exposure, symptoms present at the time of diagnosis, stage, treatments, and survival. The age distribution was: less than 40 yr, 3%; 40 to 49, 17%; 50 to 59, 28%; 60 to 69, 32%; 70 to 79, 18%; greater than or equal to 80, 2%. Men constituted 72%, and 90% were smokers. Four smokers had documented asbestos exposure. The symptoms in order of decreasing frequency were cough, weight loss, expectoration, anorexia, chest pain, dyspnea, weakness, hemoptysis, pneumonia, fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and chills. Stage could be ascertained in 120 (95%) patients. Local stage constituted 10%, regional constituted 30%, and distant constituted 60%. Local stage had the best survival, with a projected 5-yr survival of 62%. Median survivals in regional and distant stages were 8 and 4 months, respectively. Symptoms of adenosquamous lung carcinoma were similar to other histologies. Most patients present in regional or distant stages. Local-stage patients had a good long-term survival after surgical excision of the tumor.\r"

The changes in pulmonary epithelial permeability (using a radioaerosol technique), FRC, and endothelial function (the removal of radiolabeled serotonin, [14C]5-HT, and prostaglandin E1, [3H]PGE1, from the pulmonary circulation) were measured at 1 h and at 2, 7, or 14 days after NO2 exposure. In another six dogs, we evaluated changes in cell population and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid caused by NO2. In the first two days after NO2 exposure, focal pulmonary edema was documented on microscopy, radioaerosol clearance was delayed, and FRC decreased slightly. BAL showed a marked increase in albumin, but the removal of trace amounts of 5-HT and PGE1 by the endothelium was not altered. All physiologic abnormalities returned to normal with time.\r"

The effects of a standard dose of 5 micrograms/kg/min of dobutamine on oxygen-derived variables were studied in 73 acutely ill patients with heart failure (n = 24) or sepsis (n = 49). In each group, patients were separated according to their blood lactate concentrations (either above or below 2 mEq/L). In all patient groups, dobutamine resulted in significant increases in cardiac output and oxygen transport. However, oxygen consumption increased significantly only in patients with elevated blood lactate levels (cardiac failure: from 108 +/- 26 to 131 +/- 25 ml/min/M2, n = 8, p less than 0.01; sepsis: from 139 +/- 44 to 167 +/- 68 ml/min/M2, n = 16, p less than 0.01) and not in the other patients (heart failure: from 121 +/- 29 to 115 +/- 31 ml/min/M2, n = 28, NS; sepsis: from 158 +/- 39 to 166 +/- 45 ml/min/M2, n = 21, NS). These data, therefore, indicate that dobutamine at the dose used does not increase oxygen consumption in critically ill patients unless there is coexistent tissue hypoxia reflected by increased blood lactate levels. A short-term dobutamine infusion can be used to disclose an oxygen uptake/supply dependency phenomenon.\r"

Morphologic examination showed both epithelial and endothelial damage. This injury was ameliorated by the addition of catalase, which neutralizes hydrogen peroxide produced during the respiratory burst. Lung/body weight ratio in the group with stimulated eosinophils plus catalase was 7.8 +/- 1.1, and the specimens were indistinguishable from control specimens by histopathologic examination. Our results indicate that eosinophils are capable of causing acute lung injury. This injury is mediated, at least in part, by toxic oxygen products.\r"

Thirty-three students had no BCG scar, 62 had one scar, 71 had two scars, and 42 had three scars. The mean age for each group was 19 yr. All students were healthy and had no known exposure to tuberculosis or history of tuberculosis or other mycobacterioses. The size in millimeters of induration of the first tuberculin reaction (PPD1) was clearly correlated with the number of BCG scars: 2.3 +/- 4.6 for no scars; 6.7 +/- 6.7 for one scar; 10.9 +/- 5.9 for two scars, and 13.2 +/- 5.3 for three scars. The second tuberculin reaction (PPD2), performed 2 wk later on the contralateral forearm, showed a marked increase in reactivity. The increase in reaction size was most evident in students who had BCG scars but who were initially PPD negative (less than 10 mm). Smaller increases were observed in students without BCG scars, and also in those who had BCG scars but who were initially tuberculin positive (greater than or equal to 10 mm). The persistence of the booster effect was evaluated by performing PPD3 1 yr later. PPD1-negative students with BCG scars maintained the increased level of reactivity to PPD2 after 1 yr. An immunizing effect of tuberculin testing was suggested in 11 nonimmunized students who were initially PPD negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred sixty rats were divided into a pair-fed (PF) group (n = 80) and a steroid-treated (ST) group (n = 80). The treated rats received a single injection of Kenacort 80 retard (0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly). The experimental period was 8 days. Steroid treatment resulted in a 30% decrease in body weight in the ST group when compared with the PF group. Diaphragmatic mass in the ST group decreased in proportion to body weight (30%) as did the weight of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL). The soleus muscle was unaffected. The diaphragmatic atrophy was associated with a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in normalized tetanic force as assessed both in vivo and in vitro. Diaphragmatic strength was determined in vivo by measuring transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves at different frequencies (0.5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 1000 Hz). The force-frequency relationship was also studied in vitro using direct stimulation of costal diaphragmatic strips. In both preparations, twitch and low-frequency force were unaffected, whereas normalized tetanic force in the ST group was markedly reduced compared with that in the PF group (p less than 0.001). Soleus and EDL muscles were also studied in vitro. Although steroid treatment had no effect on the soleus, in the EDL, a slight (11%) decrease in normalized tetanic tension was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This report presents a simple clinical method to quantify the pressure generated within ascites fluid and thus to examine the effect of that fluid upon lung volume. The intra-abdominal hydrostatic pressure (Pih) given in cm H2O is the height of the meniscus of a column of water above the anterior abdominal wall measured with the patient supine. Pih thus may be thought of as a pressure in excess of the height of the anterior abdominal wall. In 23 study subjects, Pih measured 7.0 +/- 4.8 cm H2O; Pih correlated inversely with all static volumes. Furthermore, abdominal compliance (measured as the ratio of 100 ml ascites fluid removed divided by the difference between Pih before and after fluid removal) correlated directly with functional residual capacity. We conclude that the effect of ascites upon respiratory function varies among patients; the variation may be explained in part by Pih.\r"

  ".W": "Populations living at high altitude are known to have a number of distinctive physiologic traits, including an increase in lung volume and compliance. We asked whether the factors that result in the increased compliance of high altitude natives were sufficiently expressed in utero that an increase in respiratory system compliance (Crs) could be detected at birth. Measurements were performed at about 1 day after birth on 34 infants born in La Paz, Bolivia (3,600 m, Pb about 495 mm Hg) and 36 born in Santa Cruz (400 m, Pb about 735 mm Hg). All infants were full-term and healthy, with body weights of at least 2,700 g. We measured Crs from expirations within the tidal volume range by the multiple occlusion method. Breathing pattern was measured from the spirometric record, and an index of chest wall distortion was obtained from the ratio of volume and abdominal displacement during spontaneous breathing and relaxations against closed airways. Rib cage and abdomen dimensions did not differ between the two groups. Crs values in Santa Cruz were similar to those previously obtained in Montreal and in other Caucasian infant populations at low altitudes. Crs was 33% and Crs/kg 37% greater (p less than 0.001) in the high altitude group, which included equal numbers of Amerindians and Mestizos of European ancestry. Dynamic elevation of the end-expiratory level was similar in both groups. Ventilation/kg and the distortion ratio were slightly yet significantly higher in the high altitude infants, suggesting an increased ventilatory drive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Refeeding and weight gain were associated with a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count and with an increase in reactivity to skin test antigens after 21 days of refeeding. Few changes occurred in large numbers of additional serum measurements during the study period. These preliminary observations suggest that dietary and supplementary refeeding may improve the immune responses in patients with COPD.\r"

To evaluate this, the severity of emphysema, the elastase burden, and the elastase inhibitory capacity were estimated in 28 patients with chronic bronchitis and variable degrees of emphysema, none of whom had congenital deficiency of alpha-1-protease inhibitor, and all of whom underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Emphysema was assessed by both computed tomography and diffusing capacity. To examine \"elastase burden,\" elastase:alpha-1-protease inhibitor complex and free elastase activity in alveolar lavage fluids were measured. To evaluate \"antielastase\" capacity, elastase inhibiting capacity in alveolar lavage fluid was measured. Elastase burden correlated directly and antielastase capacity correlated inversely with emphysema. These data provide direct support for the \"protease-antiprotease imbalance\" theory of emphysema in a group of smokers without congenital deficiency of alpha-1-protease inhibitor.\r"

  ".W": "An increased TLC has been reported during exacerbations of asthma, but the methods used (helium, dilution, plethysmography) have been subsequently found unreliable in the assessment of lung volumes in patients with obstructive lung disease. To address this problem, we measured TLC (TLC-XR) from posteroanterior and lateral chest roentgenograms obtained during exacerbations (E) of asthma and after recovery (R) using planimetry in 12 asthmatic subjects. At recovery, TLC was also measured by plethysmography or by helium dilution for comparison with the radiographic measurement. The plethysmographic measurements were made with a panting frequency less than 1 Hz to allow for airway obstruction. A chest radiologist also used independent radiologic measurements of hyperinflation (lung height, diaphragmatic arc height, rib counts) to assess lung volumes. Mean FEV1 during E was 1.43 +/- 0.38 L, and significant improvement occurred at R (FEV1 = 2.81 +/- 0.58 L, p less than 0.05). Of the independent radiologic variables measured, only an increase in lung height distinguished the two sets of radiographs. Mean TLC-XR (E) (6.01 +/- 1.62 L) was significantly greater than mean TLC-XR (R) (5.44 +/- 1.17 L, p less than 0.05). TLC measured radiographically at recovery was strongly correlated (r = 0.94) with TLC measured by plethysmography or helium dilution. We conclude that acute reversible increases in TLC do occur during exacerbations of asthma and that these changes are only readily detected by formal planimetry.\r"

  ".W": "Although parathyroid autotransplantation during the course of thyroidectomy was first described by Halsted in 1907, it is only during the past 20 years that this simple and effective method of preserving parathyroid function is being used by an increasing number of surgeons. Our group has autotransplanted normal parathyroids since 1965, whenever these glands could not be preserved in situ with adequate blood supply. With increasing experience, we find it much simpler to autotransplant parathyroid glands attached to the thyroid, than to dissect their precarious blood supply, hoping they will survive postoperative edema and fibrosis. Furthermore, it is our impression that in operations for thyroid carcinoma, attempts to preserve the blood supply to the parathyroids may compromise the completeness of the thyroidectomy or of the dissection of cervical nodes in the tracheoesophageal groove. In a review of our experience during the past four years (January 1, 1984 to December 31, 1988), 87 patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Parathyroid glands that could not be saved in situ were biopsied to confirm their identity by frozen section and autotransplanted in the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. Among the 87 patients undergoing total thyroidectomy, 34 required no autotransplantation, whereas 52 had one to three glands autotransplanted, and one had four glands autotransplanted. Postoperatively, 23 patients (26 percent) developed hypocalcemia, whereas 18 required CaCO3 and five required vitamin D in addition. All patients (98%) except two had normal parathyroid function at four-month follow-up and thereafter, as judged by serum calcium, phosphorus and parathormone, when indicated.\r"

After treatment, 30 treatment and 30 control rats received a dorsal skin incision which was closed primarily. Wound breaking strength were tested at one, three and five weeks in ten rats from each group. An 8-mm orocutaneous fistula was made in the remaining ten treatment and ten control rats; the rate of closure was noted weekly. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil did not significantly impair wound breaking strength at one, three, or five weeks. The rate of closure of the orocutaneous fistula was not effected by cisplatin/5-fluorouracil. The chemotherapy caused severe facial cellulitis and death in four orocutaneous fistula rats. Combined chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil should not interfere with planned surgical care of head and neck tumors. Concomitant antibiotic coverage, however, is advocated.\r"

Samples from 44 of these 47 tumors were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis for the presence of neuroendocrine (NE) antigens. Paraffin sections were immunostained with antibodies to NSE, chromogranin, serotonin, VIP, substance P and somatostatin. Additional sections were also stained with monoclonal antibody (Mab) A-80 that recognizes a glycoprotein related to exocrine (EX) differentiation. Based on our findings, the tumors were phenotypically reclassified as follows: I) pure EX (n = 8), II) pure NE (n = 4), III) mixed EX-NE carcinomas (n = 23), and IV) predominantly EX carcinomas with occasional NE cells (n = 9). Survival among groups II and III appeared to be less than group I and survival in group IV was significantly less than group I. Survival among the four pure NE (group II) and 11 predominantly NE mixed carcinomas (group III) taken together was significantly less than the pure EX carcinomas. This study indicates: 1) The incidence of NE differentiation in tumors of the colon and rectum is higher than previously believed. 2) The poorly differentiated colon carcinomas comprise four distinct groups: pure EX, pure NE, mixed EX-NE carcinomas, and predominantly EX carcinomas with a NE cell subpopulation. 3) The presence of NE differentiation or of a NE cell subpopulation in colon carcinoma appears to be associated with a poorer prognosis.\r"

Thyroid needle biopsy now allows their preoperative diagnosis and potential definitive treatment. This study reviews four patients with nonfunctioning parathyroid cysts treated during a two-year period. Three women and one man range in age from 28 to 70 years. Each presented with an asymptomatic thyroid mass ranging from 3 to 5 cm in length. None had symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism. Serum calciums were from 9.2 to 10.7 mg/dl and serum phosphoruses were 3.2 to 4.4 mg/dl. Needle aspiration revealed 5 to 85 cc of water-clear fluid. C-terminal parathyroid hormone in three patients was 12,600, 6,500 and 61,200 pg/ml and N-terminal PTH was 1,700 pg/ml in one. All four had normal serum calcium and phosphorus on follow-up ranging from six months to two years. Two patients had resolution of their cysts with a single aspiration. One patient had recurrence but has no evidence of recurrence six months after injection with tetracycline. Another patient had a recurrence but remains well one year following reaspiration. Nonfunctioning parathyroid cysts present as a thyroid mass. Needle aspiration of water-clear fluid high in parathormone is diagnostic and, in most patients, is the therapeutic modality of choice.\r"

Twenty-one of 22 patients in the first treatment group (FMe) received 5-fluorouracil and a nitrosourea. The second group of eight patients received the same drugs plus Adriamycin (FAMe). Twenty-one patients were observed as surgical controls. Each adjuvant treatment group was subdivided into groups of patients with zero to four or five or more lymph node metastases for survival analysis. Fifteen patients were alive without evidence of disease at five years. Analysis of variance of survival times showed that lymph node status (P = 0.0001) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.01) were statistically significant prognostic variables. The FMe group had the best survival. A Fisher's exact test showed that the FMe group had a greater proportion of five-year survivors (P = 0.0217) than the no treatment arm. Patients with only zero to four positive lymph nodes in the FMe group had a statistically greater number of five-year survivors than patients in the no treatment arm (P = 0.0155). In this series, postoperative 5-fluorouracil and MeCCNU significantly improved the survival times of patients after curative gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma as compared with surgical controls.\r"

For in situ breast cancer local excision (LE), local excision and radiation therapy (LERT) and mastectomy (MAST) have all been advocated. A search of the English literature found 13 reports concerning the surgical management of LCIS and 12 reports concerning the management of DCIS. The data were combined in a meta-analysis of outcome. As expected, recurrence rates following LE with both LCIS 8.4%) and DCIS (17%) are high. However,the overall mortality following mastectomy for recurrence, LCIS (2.8%) and DCIS (2.3%) does not differ statistically from those treated initially with mastectomy for LCIS (0.9%) and DCIS (1.7%). We conclude from these data that local recurrence after breast conserving procedures for in situ breast cancer does not carry an ominous prognosis. This knowledge should aid in planning individual therapy.\r"

From 1976 to 1988, 109 biliary enteric bypass procedures were performed on patients with pancreatic carcinoma considered unresectable at exploration. Sixty-four of these patients underwent cholecystoenteric anastomosis (CCEA) and 45 choledochoenteric anastomosis (CDEA). Thirty-day operative mortality was 6.3 per cent for CCEA and 8.8 per cent for CDEA; the mean length of survival after operation was 7.8 months for CCEA and 8.9 months for CDEA. Of the 64 patients who underwent CCEA, all but two experienced short-term (greater than 60 days) relief of jaundice and pruritus. These patients were found to have an obstructed cystic duct and a cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed. Five other patients in the CCEA group had recurrence of jaundice for an overall failure rate of 10.9 per cent. Operative morbidity in this group was 14 per cent. One of the patients in the CDEA group had an early recurrence of jaundice and three others experienced late recurrence, for an overall failure rate of 8.8 per cent. Operative morbidity in this group was 16 per cent. We conclude that these procedures have comparable morbidity and mortality. Although a few patients with cholecystoenteric anastomosis will develop recurrent jaundice, the simplicity of the procedure, the shorter operative time, and the equivalent relief of symptoms make it a useful procedure and one we believe preferable in high-risk patients.\r"

However, very little information is available on the incidence of estrogen receptor in such lesions and the probability of treatment success. Fourteen formalin-fixed tissue specimens of intraductal carcinoma in situ from 14 female patients aged 40 to 66 years were evaluated for the presence of estrogen receptor by immunoperoxidase technique using estrogen receptor antibody. Eight of the 14 lesions (57%) were positive for estrogen receptor. The incidence of estrogen receptor in intraductal carcinoma in situ is very similar to that of invasive carcinoma of breast, leading to the speculation that ER-positive invasive carcinoma originates from ER-positive precursor lesions. Since only 70 per cent of positive receptor lesions are expected to respond to antiestrogens, it appears that only 40 per cent of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of breast will benefit from endocrine therapy.\r"

A retrospective review of 112 patients (pts) undergoing lumpectomy and radiation therapy (RT) in our institution revealed a six per cent incidence of delayed breast abscess (range 1.5-8 months, median 5 months). Prophylactic antibiotics (P = 1.0), postoperative chemotherapy (P = 1.0), primary vs. re-excisional lumpectomy (P = 1.0), and different surgeons (P = 0.514) were not associated with increased risk of delayed abscess. All abscesses occurred in the first 32 pts of this series. The size of the lumpectomy cavity correlated with the incidence of infection (P = 0.0440). Since six of seven abscess cultures grew staphylococci (coagulase negative three pts, coagulase positive three pts), and four of these pts experienced prior biopsy site infection, skin necrosis or repeated seroma aspirations, a skin source for contamination was suggested. Treatment of the abscesses with antibiotics and immediate drainage produced acceptable but inferior cosmesis. We conclude that a small but significant subset of patients treated with lumpectomy and RT will develop delayed wound infections and that expeditious treatment affords satisfactory cosmesis.\r"

Fourteen operations were for therapeutic indications, eight were emergent. The array of pathology encountered included opportunistic infection with Mycobacterium avium intracellulare, Cytomegalovirus, Cryptosporidium, abdominal tuberculosis, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, AIDS-related immune thrombocytopenia, perforated appendicitis and colonic pseudo-obstruction. Hospital mortality was 20 per cent. Major morbidity occurred in 15 per cent of patients and was more common following emergency operations. Preoperative demographic, hematologic, or nutritional parameters examined or the presence of single-organ system dysfunction did not predict outcome. Fifty-three per cent of hospital survivors are alive with a nine-month median postoperative follow-up. It is concluded that major abdominal procedures in patients with AIDS should not be withheld due to fear of excessive morbidity or mortality. General surgeons are involved in the evaluation and treatment of increasing numbers of patients with HIV infection. Appropriate management requires recognition of a wide range of surgical pathology and attention to details of safe intraoperative conduct.\r"

  ".W": "Open management of the peritoneal cavity with mesh insert in severe peritonitis has been the subject of favorable clinical reports. The present study was undertaken to develop an animal model suitable for investigation of this technique. Peritonitis was induced in anesthetized rats using the technique of cecal puncture following nonobstructing cecal ligation. A pilot study with this technique did not result in either intestinal distention or edema. Therefore, distal ileal ligation was added to duplicate the clinical findings associated with diffuse peritonitis. Twenty animals treated in this manner underwent standard abdominal wall closure and were simply observed for 96 hours. This produced a 15 per cent mortality at 24 hours, 65 per cent at 48 hours, 70 per cent at 72 hours, and 80 per cent at 96 hours. A second group underwent sham laparotomy only (n = 5) with a resultant 100 per cent survival. Based on these preliminary findings, two study groups were defined. Animals in both groups had cecal ligation and puncture and ileal ligation performed. Group I (n = 22) animals underwent re-laparotomy 24 hours later with primary fascial closure, while group II (n = 23) animals underwent re-laparotomy at 24 hours with placement of a standardized Dexon mesh insert covered by a superficial polyethylene film to prevent fluid loss. No animals received antibiotics. Cumulative mortalities in group I were 77, 90, 90, and 90 per cent at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after reoperation. In group II mortalities were found to be 48, 57, 61, and 70 per cent at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Topographically the regions of air and atelectasis corresponded to the distribution of ciliated and flat epithelia in the middle ear, respectively. The presence of air in the middle ears obliges us to view these ears as being aerated gas pockets. The aeration difference between such an atelectatic ear and one in a physiologic state is probably a difference of degree. This difference can result from reduction in aeration through the eustachian tube or from excessive absorption of gases into the circulation, or from deficient normal diffusion of carbon dioxide or nitrogen from the circulation into the middle ear, or from a combination of these factors. The analogy with the respiratory system is emphasized.\r"

Obstruction was modeled by use of a series of four polyvinyl endotracheal tubes narrowed progressively in their midportions with C clamps. Percentage ratios of helium-oxygen gas mixtures were 0:100, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. Gas flow was provided by two methods: 1) nontidal flow from compressed gas tanks from which resistance was calculated from pressure and flow measurements, and 2) tidal respiratory flow from human volunteers from whom respiratory effort was evaluated by using airway pressure measurements integrated over 90-second trial periods. The results derived from both methods demonstrated that the effect of helium in reducing resistance and pressure in an obstructed airway is linear (p less than .016) and inversely proportional to helium concentration. Reductions in resistance and pressure were larger for the tighter obstructions (p less than .007). As helium was added to the gas mixture (from 0% to 80%), resistance and airway pressure measurements dropped 42% and 58%, respectively. The major conclusions are that 1) even low concentrations of helium may have therapeutic value and 2) helium is effective only for more severe obstructions.\r"

A single injection of propranolol resulted in a decrease of peroxidase-positive secretory granules, an increase of electron-lucent granules, and no change in the level of peroxidase activity in the r-ER and Golgi complex at either 5 or 9 hours after the injection. Continuous administration of propranolol over 7 hours led to the disappearance of peroxidase activity from the r-ER and secretory granules. These data would indicate that propranolol inhibits only the synthesis of peroxidase. Twenty minutes after a single injection of isoproterenol, the rate at which the granule content containing the peroxidase reaction product was discharged into the acinar lumen increased sharply. However, 60 minutes after the injection, the secretion rate of peroxidase-positive granules decreased. The same experiment then was repeated, but this time before the isoproterenol was injected, propranolol was administered to the cats. This time no change in peroxidase activity appeared in the acinar cells. It was concluded, therefore, that the stimulation of beta-receptors enhances the synthesis of peroxidase.\r"

The hypoplastic left ventricle of an 11-year-old girl with complex double-outlet right ventricle was successfully incorporated in a modified biventricular repair by Dacron patch closure of the ventricular septal defect, diversion of venous return of the inferior vena cava to the mitral valve with an intraatrial baffle, insertion of a left ventricular apex to pulmonary artery valved aortic homograft, and diversion of residual systemic venous return directly to the lungs with a bidirectional superior vena cava to pulmonary artery shunt. Postoperatively, the systemic venous atrial pressure was 6 mm Hg and the pulmonary artery pressure was 14 mm Hg. This method is proposed as a partial biventricular repair hemodynamically superior to the Fontan procedure, although aortic homograft revision may be required in the future.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested that excision of the mitral valve apparatus during mitral valve replacement impairs left ventricular performance. However, functional measurements in humans have been difficult to obtain in a load-independent fashion. To investigate this concept, 12 patients (mean age, 65 +/- 8 years; mean New York Heart Association functional class, 3.3 +/- 0.7) with 4+ mitral regurgitation (n = 8) or mitral stenosis (valve area, 1.2 +/- 0.2 cm2) (n = 4) underwent prosthetic valve replacement using crystalloid cardioplegia. No patient required therapeutic inotropic support, every patient had at least the anterior mitral leaflet excised, and paced heart rate was maintained constant throughout. Left ventricular volume was measured with radionuclide angiocardiography, left ventricular pressure with a 3F micromanometer, and left ventricular wall volume with two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. Left ventricular preload was varied over a mean end-diastolic pressure range of 9 to 20 mm Hg and an end-diastolic volume range of 134 to 170 mL to generate four to five steady-state pressure-volume loops before and ten minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass. Left ventricular performance was estimated with the stroke work/end-diastolic volume relationship, which is insensitive to load. After bypass, no significant change (p greater than 0.1) was noted in wall volume for patients with mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis (175 +/- 68 to 189 +/- 63 mL/m2 and 130 +/- 22 to 127 +/- 19 mL/m2, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A flanged, reclosable cannula 4.0 mm in internal diameter is inserted through the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea. Sixty procedures were performed in 56 patients from July 1988 to June 1989. Indications for placement included excessive postoperative secretions (46/60), difficulty with endotracheal suctioning (4/60), preoperative secretions (4/60), postpneumonic secretions (5/60), and acute airway obstruction (1/60). Successful intratracheal placement was possible in all instances, and the device was well tolerated. Major intratracheal bleeding necessitating endotracheal intubation occurred in 2 patients. Minor complications included local hematoma (5 patients), subcutaneous emphysema (2 patients), and hoarseness (1 patient). No deaths occurred. Cannulas remained in place for one day to 35 days. Removal resulted in closure within 48 hours. No adverse laryngeal effects were seen. A successful result, not requiring other invasive methods to remove secretions, was obtained in 43 (72%) of the 60 procedures. Minitracheostomy is a useful adjunct for secretion removal in the hospitalized patient.\r"

The prognosis for patients with Shone's anomaly is poor. To assess operative results and late outcome, we reviewed the records of 30 consecutive patients seen with Shone's anomaly at our institution between 1966 and 1989. Anatomical diagnoses in these patients were supravalvar mitral ring (22 patients), mitral valve abnormalities including parachute mitral valve, fused chordae, or single papillary muscle (26 patients), subaortic gradients (26 patients), and coarctation (29 patients). Nineteen patients had all four lesions. Other common defects were bicuspid aortic valve (19 patients) and ventricular septal defect (20). Two patients were treated medically. The other 28 patients required 84 operative procedures with 18 patients undergoing more than one procedure. Operations included coarctation repair (28 patients), mitral valve repair or replacement (11), ventricular septal defect closure (8), subaortic resection (8), and complex left ventricular outflow tract reconstruction or bypass (4). Age at first operation ranged from 7 days to 7 years (median age, 3 months). There were no operative deaths at the first operation. However, mortality rose to 24% (4/17) after the second operation. All operative deaths were secondary to severe mitral valve disease. The survivors have been followed from 1 to 16 years (mean follow-up, 6 +/- 1 years). There were no late or sudden deaths. Morbidity has included stroke (1), gastrointestinal bleeding (2), permanent heart block (1), and persistent congestive heart failure (6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We evaluated the effect of normalizing blood calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) on postischemic left ventricular systolic and diastolic mechanics using oxygen consumption and indices derived from pressure-diameter relations. In 10 open-chest dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass, the hearts underwent 30 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by one hour of multidose hypothermic (4 degrees C), hypocalcemic (0.3 mmol/L) blood cardioplegia. After reperfusion, systemic [Ca2+] had decreased to 70% of control (p = 0.017). The left ventricular inotropic state was significantly depressed from baseline (control) values, but was restored to baseline levels by resumption of normocalcemia after one hour of reperfusion. Chamber stiffness increased by 308% (p = 0.006) after hypocalcemic reperfusion but decreased significantly after [Ca2+] correction. Recovery of left ventricular performance with [Ca2+] correction did not augment myocardial oxygen consumption from the postischemic uncorrected state (5.0 +/- 0.3 mL O2/min/100 g versus 5.3 +/- 0.3 mL O2/min/100 g). We conclude that normalizing [Ca2+] after blood cardioplegia improves postischemic left ventricular performance without adversely affecting compliance or oxygen consumption.\r"

Reexploration for bleeding (49 procedures) (3.9%) and intraaortic balloon removal (50 procedures) (4.0%) were the two most common procedures. Ninety percent and 96% of these procedures, respectively, were performed in the intensive care unit. Mediastinal infections occurred in 4 (6.1%) of 66 patients undergoing repeat mediastinal operations for all indications. No infection occurred after reexploration for bleeding nor did mediastinal infection occur after reoperation in the intensive care unit. Postoperative death in these 110 patients was not related to reoperation except possibly in the case of 1 patient (0.9%). Average transit time to and from the operating room for patients returned there for reoperation was 89.7 minutes. Charges for procedures performed in the operating room were at least twice as great as for those performed in the intensive care unit. This experience supports expanded use of reoperation in the intensive care unit, as it is safe, effective, economical, and convenient.\r"

This study examined the production of thromboxane A2 by endothelial cells and its modulation by the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine in vitro. The results indicate that (1) endothelial cells spontaneously secrete thromboxane A2, (2) this production can be enhanced severalfold in the presence of arachidonic acid, and (3) the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine significantly inhibits thromboxane production without demonstrable toxicity to the endothelial cells.\r"

No technique of coarctation repair was free from complications. Although there were only two stenoses in the group receiving Dacron patch angioplasty, only seven of these procedures were performed in children under the age of 1 year. The risk of stenosis was inversely correlated to the age at primary repair, with children less than 1 year old being at greater risk than those more than 1 year of age (p less than 0.05). Subclavian flap angioplasty had a lower risk of reoperation than end-to-end anastomosis (p less than 0.02). Formation of true aneurysms was confined to the Dacron patch angioplasty group. The morbidity and mortality for reintervention was low in all groups, with only one procedure-related death and no incidence of paraplegia. Although no technique is free from risk, subclavian flap angioplasty leads to fewer reinterventions in younger patients.\r"

  ".W": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been shown to a clear role in the suppression of immune responses after burn and trauma injury. This probably results from inhibition of interleukin-2 production. This study examined the effects of PGE2 in vivo on the survival of solid-organ allografts and in vitro on the rat allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response. Administration of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (DMPGE2), a stable analogue of PGE2, significantly prolonged the survival of heterotopic cardiac allografts from ACI to LBN rats: 10.4 +/- 1.7 days versus 5.7 +/- 1.1 days (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (p less than or equal to 0.001). In 1 animal, DMPGE2 apparently led to the induction of long-term tolerance. Mixed lymphocyte cultures using splenocytes from naive LBN and ACI rats to which DMPGE2 was added showed a dose-dependent suppression of the mixed lymphocyte response with concentrations as low as 1 x 10(-7) mol/L. Splenocytes harvested from treated animals with functioning but histologically rejecting hearts demonstrated a marked decrease in mixed lymphocyte response to donor (ACI) stimulators compared with naive LBN controls (3,804 +/- 603 versus 27,395 +/- 2,668 cpm, n = 4), but maintained a normal response to third-party (Wistar Furth) stimulators. We conclude that DMPGE2 suppressed solid-organ allograft rejection, inhibited the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response, and induced donor-specific in vitro hyporesponsiveness.\r"

University of Wisconsin solution has remarkably extended ischemic preservation in pancreas, kidney, and liver transplantation. To assess its efficacy in cardiac preservation, modified University of Wisconsin solution flush and storage were tested against St. Thomas' cardioplegia flush and normal saline solution storage after six hours of ischemia at 0 degrees C in 46 isolated rat hearts. After ischemia, groups were compared before and after reperfusion. After ischemia but before reperfusion, University of Wisconsin solution hearts had significantly less tissue water (3.8%), superior tissue sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium profiles, and elevated adenosine and inosine levels, and tended toward better histological preservation. After reperfusion, University of Wisconsin solution more effectively preserved left ventricular compliance (75% versus 35% of baseline), developed pressure (71% versus 45% of baseline), histological integrity, and tissue potassium and calcium profiles than St. Thomas' solution. The University of Wisconsin solution provided superior preservation of systolic and diastolic ventricular function, tissue histology, tissue water, and tissue electrolytes than did St. Thomas' cardioplegia and normal saline solution storage in this experimental model, and might result in improved graft tolerance of ischemia in clinical cardiac transplantation.\r"

In a 5-year period, 10 children ranging in age from 2 to 16 years underwent lung decortication for a refractory, symptomatic empyema, which had developed 3 to 5 weeks after an initial pneumonic infiltrate. Responsible organisms included beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 children. Negative cultures were found in 4 children. The initial computed tomographic scan of the chest in 4 of 8 patients showed more than 75% limitation of lung expansion by the contents of the empyema cavity. In 4 other patients, an extensive pleural peel was seen on initial computed tomographic scan of the chest. Several studies also showed cystic lesions in the collapsed lung. Multiple computed tomographic scans in 3 patients confirmed the lack of clinical and chest roentgenographic improvement with conservative therapy. At decortication in each, the visceral and parietal pleural peel was completely removed, freeing the trapped lung. Two patients also had a concomitant lobectomy for a necrotic right upper lobe (1 patient) and left lower lobe (1). Clinical improvement was marked, with return of temperature, white blood cell count, and appetite to normal. Postoperative morbidity was minimal. Analysis of these patients in whom traditional conservative therapy failed suggested that the initial management during the early exudative phase was often delayed and was not aggressive enough from the standpoint of pleural drainage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 6 mongrel dogs, a circumferential defect involving seven rings of the cervical trachea was reconstructed by interposing pedicled esophagus. A silicone T tube was used as a stent. The vertical limb of the T tube (usually referred to as the horizontal limb when used in humans) was cut shorter after the cervical wound had healed well, and it eventually was buried subcutaneously. Two dogs died 36 days after operation, and 1 died 28 weeks after operation. In no dog was the cause of death related to the operation or to a respiratory tract complication. Two dogs were put to death 4 weeks and 32 weeks after operation. They were well until then, and all the anastomoses between the trachea and the esophagus had healed fully without formation of granulation tissue. One dog is alive and well 14 months after operation. The vertical limb of the T tube retracted into the subcutaneous space, and there is no open cervical wound. Esophageal interposition might be a feasible technique for tracheal replacement in select groups of patients.\r"

A silicone stent was placed in the lumen of the intestinal fragment and was removed the second week after operation. Endoscopic and histological examinations were performed between the first week and second month after operation, and rigidity of the graft was assessed in all cases. No evidence of anastomotic stricture or mucous formation was found. Microscopic examination showed the substitution of bowel mucosa by squamous epithelium as well as the development of connective tissue favoring the fixation of the skeletal muscular structures of the neck to the serous layer of the graft, thus avoiding collapse of the new airway.\r"

A consecutive, case-matched series of 65 patients with prosthetic ring mitral valve repair was compared with 65 patients undergoing mitral valve replacement for mitral regurgitation. The aortic cross-clamp time was 57 +/- 33 minutes in the repair operations and 41 +/- 25 minutes in the replacement operations (p = 0.003). The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 154 +/- 44 minutes in the repair operations and 113 +/- 41 minutes in the replacement operations (p = 0.0001). There were no myocardial infarctions in the hospital in either group. Hospital death was noted in 1.5% of repairs and 4.6% of replacements (p = not significant). Survival at 4 years was 0.84 for repairs and 0.82 for replacements (p = not significant). Freedom from reoperation to replace the mitral valve at 4 years was 62 of 65 patients in the repair group and 64 of 65 patients in the replacement group (p = not significant). In-hospital and midterm results in a closely matched population show that mitral valve repair yields results comparable with those of replacement despite a more difficult procedure. The benefits of maintaining the native valve with chordal and papillary muscle structure intact and avoidance of prosthetic valve implantation may then become apparent with longer follow-up.\r"

The aortic cross-clamp was placed on the ascending aorta distal to the aortic cannula. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow was reduced to about 10% of full flow, achieving a line pressure of 35 to 45 mm Hg to keep the heart perfused and beating during arch repair. Once the aortic arch was repaired, total body perfusion was continued as usual and intracardiac repair was performed. Isolated myocardial perfusion for aortic arch reconstruction reduces myocardial ischemic time.\r"

Two different types of hemoconcentrator were compared: the ultrafilter (group I, 6 patients) and the Cell Saver (group II, 6 patients). The total serum protein level, expressed as the percent recovery of the preoperative value, after hemoconcentration was significantly higher in group I (group I versus group II: total serum protein, 118% versus 87% [p less than 0.05]; fibrinogen, 77% versus 50% [p less than 0.01]; immunoglobulin, 83% versus 60% [p less than 0.01]). The platelets also seemed to be well preserved after hemoconcentration in group I. Although the exclusion of free hemoglobin from plasma was inferior in group I compared with group II, the postoperative plasma free hemoglobin level did not increase in group I. We conclude that use of the Cell Saver in nontransfusion cardiopulmonary bypass might cause a severe depletion of various proteins and that the ultrafilter is both safer and more useful if employed routinely.\r"

Life-threatening acute posterior mediastinitis due to esophageal perforation was diagnosed in 16 patients over the past 12 years. Esophageal perforation resulted from endoscopy in 11 patients, retching in 4, and blunt trauma in 1 patient. Preoperative serum albumin levels were higher in patients who survived. Fourteen of 16 patients (88%) underwent exploration: mediastinal drainage in 14 (10 survived), esophageal repair in 9 (7 survived) with diversion in 3 (3 survived), and stent placement in 2 (1 survived). Six of 16 patients (38%) died, always of polymicrobial sepsis. Female patients and those with cancer, endoscopic perforations, delayed diagnosis, persistent mediastinal contamination, mediastinal suppuration or necrotizing cellulitis, and postoperative complications did poorly. Antibiotics must be effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and against both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. Early surgical intervention is key, particularly elimination of ongoing mediastinal soilage. Thorough mediastinal debridement and wide mediastinal drainage appear to be important in improving survival of patients with life-threatening acute posterior mediastinitis due to esophageal perforation.\r"

At initial test clamping a DAP of 45 mm Hg or more was considered adequate. In 42 patients (group A), DAP exceeded 45 mm Hg and the operation proceeded. In 25 patients (group B) the DAP was less than 45 mm Hg, and adjustments were made to the position of the proximal and distal clamps and in the use of hypotensive agents. After these adjustments in group B, DAP rose from 34.7 to 50.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), achieving the desired level in all but 5 patients, who required temporary shunts to support the distal circulation. The adjustments were as follows: the left subclavian artery was open in 28% of patients before and 60% after (p less than 0.02); no more than one pair of intercostal arteries was clamped in 64% before and 88% after (p less than 0.05); and no hypotensive agents were used in 56% before and 80% after (p = 0.07). During the first ten minutes of cross-clamping the DAP rose by 5.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.01, n = 52). It is concluded that continuous monitoring of DAP contributed to the operative management of these patients by indicating when adjustments in the position of the clamps or in the use of hypotensive agents were needed. The use of hypotensive agents should be reduced to achieve a higher DAP.\r"

All had congestive heart failure requiring inotropic agents (58%), ventilation (42%), and/or prostaglandin E1 (35%) preoperatively. Nine patients with isolated aortic stenosis had an operative mortality of 0%, whereas 17 patients with other anatomical lesions had a 47% mortality (p less than 0.01). Univariate analysis failed to identify additional risk factors other than year of operation (p less than 0.05). There were four late deaths, three probably related to arrhythmia (actuarial survival at 113 months = 0.53). Two patients have required late reoperation; neither required valve replacement.\r"

  ".W": "The stenotic aortic valve was surgically repaired in 48 adults, 21 women and 27 men, aged 38 to 83 years. Five had congenital aortic stenosis (AS), with a mean aortic valve gradient and area of 58 +/- 23 mm Hg (standard deviation) and 0.54 +/- 0.13 cm2, respectively; 32 had senile AS with a mean aortic valve gradient and area of 43 +/- 20 mm Hg and 0.98 +/- 0.41 cm2; and 11 had rheumatic AS with a mean aortic valve gradient and area of 59 +/- 24 mm Hg and 0.47 +/- 0.15 cm2. Only 6 patients underwent isolated aortic valvoplasty, 11 underwent concomitant mitral valve procedure, and 34 underwent concomitant coronary revascularization. Repair consisted of decalcification in 33 patients and decalcification as well as commissurotomy in 15 patients. There were three hospital deaths, none related to the aortic valve. Only 2 patients (both rheumatic) did not improve clinically. During follow-up (mean, 64 +/- 41 months) aortic valve restenosis developed in 24% (10 patients, 3/5 congenital, 4/11 rheumatic, and 3/32 senile) at a mean of 64 +/- 28 months. Postoperative Doppler echocardiographic assessment of 21 patients with senile AS at 1.1 +/- 2.7 and 18.1 +/- 1.4 months showed significantly lower aortic valve gradient and improved area in comparison with preoperative values. At 36 +/- 2.7 months, aortic valve gradient and area were not significantly different than preoperative values, and at 58.5 +/- 2.6 months aortic valve gradient was 1.41 (p = 0.07) times the preoperative value. At 7 years, actuarial freedom from aortic valve-related symptoms of the patients with senile AS was 87%. We conclude that in select patients aortic valve repair results in excellent relief of AS. Late restenosis is expected and more likely to occur in the valves with congenital and rheumatic disease than in those with senile disease.\r"

We reviewed the records of 36 surgical patients who underwent 39 operations for subaortic stenosis. Seventeen patients had associated congenital cardiac anomalies. One perioperative death occurred in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot. The mean preoperative left ventricular outflow tract systolic pressure gradient was 64 +/- 5 mm Hg (+/- standard error of the mean) and decreased to 9 +/- 2 mm Hg postoperatively (p less than 0.001). Reliable preoperative and postoperative information regarding aortic valve function was available for 27 patients. Aortic insufficiency was found in 17 (63%) of those patients preoperatively. Postoperatively, insufficiency increased in 3 patients and decreased in 4; none of these changes was major. Severity of preoperative aortic insufficiency increased significantly with age (p less than 0.05), but did not correlate with left ventricular outflow tract gradient. The information from this study and previous studies suggests that resection of subaortic stenosis is safe and effective, and operation at the time of diagnosis, regardless of left ventricular outflow tract gradient or symptomatic status, is a reasonable therapeutic alternative.\r"

  ".W": "To determine patterns of surgical standby for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), a questionnaire was mailed to 196 US institutions in which PTCA and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are performed regularly. Eighty-nine responses (46%) were received and comprise this report. Of responding institutions, the mean number of hospital beds was 615. In 1987, these institutions performed a mean of 337 PTCAs and 558 open-heart surgical procedures. The rate of emergency CABG for PTCA complications (occlusion, dissection, or coronary perforation) was 4.4% +/- 0.3%, whereas the rate of urgent CABG (within 24 hours) for PTCA failure was 3.7 +/- 0.6%. The incidence of emergency CABG for PTCA complications was higher (5.1% +/- 0.6%) among low-volume PTCA centers (less than 250 cases per year) than at high-volume centers (more than 250 cases per year) (3.7% +/- 0.3%; p less than 0.05). The most common pattern of surgical backup was to maintain an open operating room on standby (57/89, 64%), and the second most common pattern was to make the next open operating room available, allowing operating room access within 1 to 3 hours (21/89, 24%). Nearly a third of institutions (26/89, 29%) maintained a flexible backup arrangement according to PTCA risk. Routine pre-PTCA patient evaluation by surgeon and/or anesthesiologist occurred in 38% (34/89). Fees for standby services were charged by 51% of surgical teams (45/89), 39% of anesthesia teams (35/89), and 38% of operating room facilities (34/89).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Application methods included use of spray bottles (477/497, 96% effective), syringes (165/186, 89% effective), and a Silastic cannula through the flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope (4/6, 67% effective). The system was used in a wide variety of cardiac, pulmonary, esophageal, and vascular procedures to seal staple lines, suture lines, anastomoses, conduits, fistulas, and raw surfaces. No complications with this single-donor system secondary to blood-borne disease have been documented. Overall infection occurred at a nominal rate (16/689, 2%). Thus, fibrin sealant has been a useful tool to control the leakage of air, blood, and fluid during a wide variety of thoracic and cardiovascular procedures and may be of benefit to other surgeons.\r"

In 60 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting, acute plasmapheresis was performed, producing either platelet-poor plasma or platelet-rich plasma, in combination with either the Cell Saver or hemofiltration. Fluid balance during cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly lower in the hemofiltration patients. Postoperatively, none of these patients received donor blood, whereas 4 patients of the Cell-Saver groups needed packed red blood cells. AT-III, fibrinogen, the number of platelets, albumin, total protein, and colloid osmotic pressure were less compromised when hemofiltration was used in combination with acute plasmapheresis in contrast to combination with the Cell-Saver technique. Plasma hemoglobin was without differences during the investigation period, and polymorphonuclear elastase was less increased when platelet-rich plasma was produced preoperatively. On the first postoperative day, most of the differences between the groups had already disappeared. We conclude that when acute plasmapheresis is used in cardiac operations, discarding of plasma by the Cell Saver should be avoided and ultrafiltration devices should replace centrifugation techniques for blood conservation.\r"

The average age at operation was 11.5 years, with an operative mortality of 3.9%. The aortic valve gradient decreased from a mean preoperative value of 91 mm Hg to 27 mm Hg postoperatively. Current follow-up was 90% and averaged 16.8 years. Late cardiac mortality was 17.6%, with actuarial survival of 93.7% at 10 and 15 years, 81.8% at 20 and 25 years, and 70.9% at 28 years. Nineteen patients required reoperation (39%) at a mean of 17.7 years postoperatively, with a reoperation-free survival of 98% at 10 years. The reoperation rate accelerated in the following decade to 3.3% per year. Ten patients without reoperation were evaluated by continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography. The mean gradient was 21.6 mm Hg, and 90% had mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. This study confirms the efficacy of valvotomy in this age group and suggests that long-term survival and time to reoperation may be longer than previously reported.\r"

We defined high-risk donor variables as age greater than 40 years, systemic (noncardiac) infection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation greater than 3 minutes, ischemic time longer than 5 hours, weight more than 20% less than that of the recipient, and requirements for high doses of inotropes. Of the 305 donors we have used, 73 (23.9%) have been high-risk, with 59/73 (80.8%) exhibiting one variable, 12/73 (16.4%) exhibiting two variables, and 2/73 (2.7%) exhibiting three variables. No correlation was found between the number of donor variables and a poor postoperative result. No infectious complications occurred in 17 patients receiving hearts from potentially infected donors. Hospital mortality rates (30 day) for recipients of high-risk donor versus non-high-risk donor hearts were 8.2% and 6.9%, respectively (not significant). The 1-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial survival rates were 91.7%, 81.2%, and 75.9% for the high-risk donor group and 93.5%, 80.3%, and 77.8% for the non-high-risk donor group (not significant). Among survivors with high-risk donor hearts, mean left ventricular ejection fractions were 0.54 +/- 0.08 at 3 months, 0.55 +/- 0.08 at 1 year, and 0.54 +/- 0.09 at 2 years after transplantation. These results suggest that accepting less than ideal donor hearts can be safe and might be considered when better options are not available.\r"

Thirty-one rabbit hearts were rapidly excised and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (37 degrees C) on a Langendorff apparatus. They were arrested with hypothermic (4 degrees C), crystalloid, potassium (25 mEq/L) cardioplegia and stored at 3 degrees C for three hours, followed by reperfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer for one hour. Hearts were treated in one of several ways: Group 1 (n = 8) did not receive any L-glutamate and serve as controls; group 2 (n = 8) had L-glutamate (4 mmol/L) added to both the cardioplegic and reperfusate solutions; group 3 (n = 5) received L-glutamate only before ischemia; group 4 (n = 5) received L-glutamate only in the cardioplegic solution; and group 5 (n = 5) received L-glutamate only in the reperfusate. Hearts receiving L-glutamate in the reperfusate with or without its addition to the cardioplegic solution (groups 2 and 5) had the best recovery of the first derivative of positive and negative change in left ventricular peak systolic pressure and no significant changes in left ventricular compliance. Pretreatment with L-glutamate alone (group 3) resulted in no better recovery than in group 1 hearts. We conclude that addition of L-glutamate to reperfusate solutions after periods of cold storage for transplantation enhances the recovery of ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-two surgical patients with isolated aortic valve stenosis were studied preoperatively and postoperatively to determine the incidence of pulmonary hypertension and its response to surgical intervention. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was classified as absent (group 1, less than 30 mm Hg), mild (group 2, 30 to 39 mm Hg), moderate (group 3, 40 to 59 mm Hg), and severe (group 4, greater than 60 mm Hg). Thirty-seven of our patients (71%) had preoperative pulmonary hypertension. There was a positive correlation between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and both systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressures preoperatively (p less than 0.001). After operation we found a decrease in mean systolic pulmonary pressure in group 4, from 85.8 +/- 23 mm Hg to 41.2 +/- 10.4 mm Hg (a 52% decrease, p less than 0.001), and in group 3, from 48.9 +/- 5.9 mm Hg to 32.1 +/- 7.1 mm Hg (a 34% decrease, p less than 0.001). A significant decrease in the mean diastolic pressure was found only in group 4, in which the pressure decreased from 33.7 +/- 8.7 mm Hg to 26.0 +/- 7.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The operative mortality was 1.9%. Our data indicate that pulmonary artery hypertension in aortic stenosis is common, is related to end-diastolic pressure, and can be expected to improve in the early postoperative period.\r"

We evaluated a segmented Silastic-coated Dacron mesh band 2 to 4 mm wide sewn together with absorbable 2-0 polydioxanone suture for use as a reversible pulmonary artery band. Nine puppies 6 to 8 weeks old (mean weight, 5.8 kg) underwent placement of this pulmonary artery band. All survived the operation with a mean initial systolic gradient of 6.5 +/- 1.6 mm Hg and underwent cardiac catheterization at monthly intervals for 3 months. Two puppies died of right ventricular failure. The remaining puppies underwent balloon angioplasty with balloons 20 to 25 mm in diameter. No complications resulted from balloon angioplasty, but 1 puppy died 24 hours later of unidentified causes. Balloon angioplasty decreased the mean gradient from 46.7 +/- 6.8 mm Hg to 6.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. Angiography showed an increase in mean diameter of the site of the pulmonary artery band from 5.2 +/- 1.0 to 10.8 +/- 1.7 mm Hg. There was no evidence of vessel injury on angiograms. Fourteen months after balloon angioplasty, the mean gradient was 22.3 +/- 17.0 mm Hg. Our data demonstrate that a functionally reversible pulmonary artery band constructed of segmented Silastic-coated Dacron mesh and 2-0 polydioxanone suture is feasible.\r"

The morphological features of nine specimens obtained from 10 patients who died were reviewed. Special attention was given to features that might have influenced the poor surgical outcome in these patients. Survival after stage 1 depends on adequate systemic to pulmonary artery blood flow, initially as a combination of ductus arteriosus and shunt flow, with subsequent modification if the ductus closes. After stage 2, survival is influenced by left ventricular function and mitral valve function. The success of final correction (stage 3) depends largely on the morphology of both ventricles and their atrioventricular valves. It appears that the behavior of the ductus arteriosus and the size of the shunt are of vital importance for the survival of the infant. In 3 of the specimens, no right ventricular outflow tract was present, and in 2 others, short chordal attachments of the mitral valve were observed. Staged surgical correction appears to be a satisfactory approach if these considerations are taken into account.\r"

  ".W": "Since nationwide surveillance for pneumococcal bacteremia in the United States is not done, community-based studies are useful alternative methods to monitor trends in this disease. Data on the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in Charleston County, South Carolina, from 1974 to 1976, have been used to support cost-effective pneumococcal vaccine programs for the elderly. We reevaluated the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in Charleston County in 1986 and 1987 to assess whether earlier estimates remained valid given changes in medical practice. During 1986 and 1987, overall annual incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia in Charleston County was 18.7 per 100,000 (95% confidence limits, 13.7 to 23.6 per 100,000), which represents a 2.3-fold increase over the earlier rate. The increase coincided with a 2.2-fold increase in the annual number of blood cultures processed at four Charleston County hospital laboratories from 1975 to 1987 despite only a 1.1-fold increase in the number of patients discharged from these hospitals. Annualized rates increased 2.3-fold for adults more than or equal to 65 years old to 53 per 100,000 and 4.6-fold for children less than 2 years old to 162 per 100,000. The case-fatality rate of bacteremic patients was 18%, compared with 21% in the earlier study. The case-fatality rate for adults more than or equal to 65 years of age was 44%. Ninety-one percent of adults 19 to 64 years old with bacteremia had underlying medical conditions for which pneumococcal vaccine is recommended; all persons 55 to 64 years old had at least one underlying condition. The marked increases in pneumococcal bacteremia rates detected are likely due to more routine culturing of blood from symptomatic patients with pneumococcal disease. These findings emphasize the need for effective programs promoting use of pneumococcal vaccine in high-risk groups, particularly those more than or equal to 65 years old, and the development of a more immunogenic vaccine for children less than 2 years old.\r"

The patients were substantially less likely to be regular cigarette smokers before the current admission. Additionally the patients reported significantly less frequent consumption of total items contained in the following food groups: sugars; pulses, nuts, beans; fish; and dairy products. On average they also consumed significantly fewer alcoholic beverages. On the other hand, the patients reported more frequent consumption of items in the following food groups: cereals, potatoes, fruits, meats, fats and oils, and coffee/tea. After controlling for confounding between food groups through multiple logistic regression models, the patients were still found to be less frequent consumers of vegetables and alcoholic beverages but more frequent consumers of potatoes and items in the cereal group. These analyses also confirmed the reduced likelihood of the patients being smokers.\r"

The study cohort included 2851 women who had not been diagnosed as having a peptic ulcer prior to the baseline interview. Among these women, 140 (4.9%) developed peptic ulcer disease. During 12.5 years of follow-up, the estimated cumulative incidence of ulcers was 10.0% for current smokers, 6.4% for former smokers, and 5.4% for never smokers. After adjusting for age, education, regular aspirin use, coffee consumption, and use of alcohol, current smokers were 1.8 times more likely to develop ulcers than never smokers (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.6); the risk of peptic ulcer increased as the amount smoked increased. During the time of this study, we estimate that approximately 20% of incident peptic ulcer cases among US women were attributable to cigarette smoking.\r"

  ".U": "90314603\r", 
  ".W": "A central issue in health policy with regard to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is whether quality of care and patient outcomes are affected by resource constraints. In an earlier study of 15 California hospitals between October 1986 and October 1987, we observed a markedly lower in-hospital mortality rate for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in the group of patients treated in hospitals that had a high level of experience with AIDS relative to the group treated in hospitals with low experience. We present the patterns of resource use at hospitals with high and low AIDS familiarity. Average charges and resource use did not differ between the two groups of hospitalized patients; however, there were marked variations in how the resources were used. Among survivors, patients who received care at hospitals with high AIDS familiarity stayed in the hospital longer, underwent a bronchoscopy more often, stayed in an intensive care unit longer, and accrued higher average total charges than patients at hospitals with low AIDS familiarity. Conversely, among nonsurvivors, a greater intensity of care was received at the hospitals with low AIDS familiarity. These results suggest that, in these 15 hospitals, the markedly higher rate of in-hospital death at hospitals with low AIDS familiarity was not related to the quantity of resources that were used; rather it was related to differences in how the resources were used. Our results show that additional resources significantly improved the chances of in-hospital survival for patients at hospitals with high AIDS familiarity, but did not affect the chances of survival in hospitals with low AIDS familiarity. Our findings suggest that physicians in those hospitals in which the care of patients with AIDS is relatively infrequent might improve the chances of in-hospital survival of patients with AIDS by more timely and efficient use of resources.\r"

The majority of antibiotic prescriptions (54%) were made by telephone order. Cultures were obtained in 60% of suspected infections; two thirds of cultures were of the urine. Antibiotics were changed during the course of therapy in only 12% of cases. Eighty-one percent of residents treated with antibiotics improved or were cured, 9.5% were hospitalized or died, and an additional 9.5% failed to improve but remained in the nursing home. Fever was present in 48% of cases prior to treatment, but had no predictive value for patient outcome. We conclude that antibiotic treatment in the nursing home is often initiated in the absence of fever, culture information, or examination of the patient. Empiric prescription of antibiotics in this setting generally is associated with favorable clinical course.\r"

  ".W": "To address the problem of recruiting physicians to deliver smoking cessation interventions, Doctors Helping Smokers included a trial of physician recruitment strategies. In round 1 of Doctors Helping Smokers, three types of informational materials were mailed directly to 1110 family physicians. The physicians were asked to return a postcard if they were interested in participating in a 1-month trial of a smoking cessation intervention. Response did not differ among the three conditions; overall, 9.8% of physicians (95% confidence limits [CL], 8.0, 11.6) responded and 6.0% (95% CL, 4.6, 7.4) eventually participated in the intervention trial. The same procedure was repeated for round 2 of Doctors Helping Smokers with direct mailing to all general internists and cardiologists (n = 1108) on the mailing list of the Minnesota Medical Association. Five percent (95% CL, 3.7, 6.3) of the internists responded and 2.7% (95% CL, 1.7, 3.7) participated in the trial. Recruitment for round 3 made use of repeated face-to-face recruitment efforts at the physician's office through a managed-care organization that held contracts with the physician's clinic to provide care for its enrollees. Six months after the initiation of round 3, 59% (95% CL, 49%, 67%) of the 126 primary care physicians reported that they were giving their patients smoking cessation advice and completing the smoking intervention records. Eighteen months after the initiation of round 3, 56% (95% CL, 47%, 65%) of the 116 primary care physicians who remained in the practice reported continued activity in the project.\r"

Controlling for the influence of sex, marital status, presence of comorbid disease, and socioeconomic status, we found that age was not related to the diagnostic tests ordered for either cancer type. However, lung cancer patients with local disease who were older than age 74 years underwent definitive surgical treatment less often than did younger patients. Few patients at any age (less than 9%) with colorectal cancer did not undergo definitive surgical treatment. Patients with regional colorectal disease who were older than 74 years of age underwent radiation therapy to the abdomen less often than did younger patients. These results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that older cancer patients are less likely to undergo the same type of care received by younger patients.\r"

In this study, we reviewed the results of sequential measurements of the radial bone mineral content, performed up to 107 months after removal of the parathyroid adenoma in 71 patients suffering from primary hyperparathyroidism. Bone mineral content increased during the first year after surgery. During the period 1 to 8 months after removal of the adenoma, the mean monthly increment was 0.009 +/- 0.0022 g/cm for the radial epiphysis and 0.0084 +/- 0.0023 g/cm for the shaft. However, in 39 patients seen at the end of 1 year after surgery, the bone mineral content of the epiphysis remained more than 1 SD below the normal mean in 61% (24) of the patients and more than 2 SDs in 36% (14) of the patients. For the shaft, those percentages were 59% (23) and 26% (10), respectively. Thereafter, the monthly increment rate of bone mineral content decreased rapidly with time, so that only minor further increase could be expected. Data show that patients with a low bone mineral content when diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism will conserve life long an irreversible loss of bone as compared with a matched control population.\r"

Three hundred fifty patients attending a university-based outpatient center in a large midwestern city were surveyed. Findings show that, as fear of AIDS increases, so does reported level of discomfort with procedures conducted by a physician suspected of having AIDS. Fear of AIDS was inversely correlated with knowledge. Patient concerns regarding susceptibility to the human immunodeficiency virus infection in routine care call attention to the need for education about transmission of AIDS in the health care context.\r"

Sixty-five percent were moonlighters; moonlighters had a higher average debt ($41 644) than nonmoonlighters ($32 917). Residents viewed moonlighting as a positive educational experience that helped them with career decisions. They believed they acquired important skills and knowledge not learned elsewhere, and that moonlighting did not interfere with their job and educational responsibilities. A program in operation for 10 years that was designed to control, monitor, and facilitate moonlighting experiences is described. We believe our residents' positive views may be in part a result of the supervision and integration of moonlighting in a residency training program with a controlled workload.\r"

Giardia lamblia was more prevalent in the younger than 5-year-old age group, and helminths were more prevalent in the 6- to 10-year-old age group. No helminths were found in immigrants who had been in the US for more than 3 years. Gastrointestinal symptoms did not correlate with prevalence of parasites. The high prevalence of intestinal parasites supports previous recommendations for screening; decisions for screening should be based on morbidity (probably low), efficacy and safety of treatment (good), and costs.\r"

The other two patients had unilateral adrenal cysts, with negative metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and no histological evidence of pheochromocytoma, but complete relief of symptoms by excision of the cysts. In one patient, Cushing's syndrome and associated hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic finger-tip ulceration all disappeared after surgery. It is concluded that spontaneous hyperepinephrinemic manifestations can be received by beta-blockers or, when an adrenal mass is present, by unilateral adrenalectomy even when the metalodobenzylguanidine test result is negative.\r"

Pleocytosis or elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein was found in 12 (48%) of 15 patients studied. Oligoclonal banding was present in 6 (26%) of 23 patients. Human immunodeficiency virus was isolated by culture in 4 asymptomatic patients. The cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities we observed indicate an active process occurring in the central nervous system, even in early human immunodeficiency virus infection in asymptomatic patients. Serial observation of these patients for development of neuropsychiatric findings may provide answers to the significance of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities identified in these patients.\r"

Thirty-four symptomatic postpolio subjects, 16 asymptomatic postpolio subjects, and 41 controls were studied. A questionnaire assessed polio history. Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance (time to exhaustion) was measured at 40% of maximal isometric torque. Work capacity was determined as the product of torque and duration. Recovery of isometric strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after exhaustion. Quantitative electromyography was also performed on the quadriceps to determine motor unit action potential duration and amplitude. It was found that symptomatic subjects had evidence of more severe original polio involvement by history (documented electromyographically), were weaker and capable of performing less work than asymptomatic subjects, and recovered strength less readily than controls.\r"

Whereas vigorous high-resistive exercise increases skeletal muscle degeneration in animals with neuromuscular disorders, the effect of low-intensity, high-repetitive exercise has been conflicting. The purpose of this study was to determine if low-intensity, high-repetitive exercise has a beneficial effect on dystrophic mice. Dystrophy mice and unaffected littermates were exercised daily starting at age three weeks on a treadmill (4 m/min, 18 degrees incline, 100 meters, three weeks' duration). Exercise increased the dystrophic soleus twitch tension, the rate of twitch tension development, and the rate of twitch tension relaxation by 55%, 58%, and 48%, respectively (p less than .05). The twitch:tetanus ratio increased by 57% (p less than .05). Both the soleus and the extensor digitorum longus from the exercised dystrophic mice had significantly less degeneration (as shown by reduced internal nuclei, necrosis, fiber splitting, and moth-eaten fibers) than the nonexercised dystrophic mice (p less than .05). This study suggests that exercise training programs can be beneficial or at least not result in further muscle fiber degeneration if (1) the exercise program is started early in the course of the disease; (2) submaximal high-repetitive or even high-resistive exercise is used; and (3) the histopathologic degeneration is slowly progressive or in an arrested state.\r"

  ".W": "The muscle fibers of the biceps brachii muscle were stimulated distally with low voltage by means of two monopolar needles in 14 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DD). The electric activity was recorded proximally by means of a SFEMG electrode. The mean conduction velocity of 508 muscle fibers in situ (MFCV) calculated with this method shows that MFCV in DD patients (2.38 +/- .94 m/sec) is significantly slower than in 20 control children of the same age (3.24 +/- .53 m/sec). The distribution frequency of MFCV in all fibers tested in healthy children shows a Gaussian distribution (mode = 3.2 m/sec). In DD patients the distribution frequency is bimodal with spikes at 1.2 and 2.4 m/sec. Significant decrease in minimum propagation velocity and increased SD values were other striking results in patients with DD. Slowing and large variation in MFCV were significantly correlated with some findings in a coaxial needle electromyogram, such as long polyphasics and motor unit potentials followed by satellites. Satellites might arise from atrophic muscle fibers with slow conduction velocity. The results of MFCV were supported by the pathologic findings in DD subjects. The reported method for MFCV in situ is reliable and easy to apply in children, has merit for testing the size and function of muscle fiber, and helps to explain some electropathologic features in DD patients.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the time of recovery at the zone of injury between motor complete (Frankel A and B) and motor incomplete (Frankel C and D) cervical spinal cord injured patients for the biceps (C5), extensor carpi radialis (C6), and triceps (C7) muscles. Manual muscle testing was performed initially three to seven days postinjury, then weekly for four weeks, and then monthly for six months. Subjects between the ages of 15 and 70 years with C4, C5, C6, or C7 neurologic levels were classified according to whether their selected muscle was greater than 0/5 and less than 3/5 grade (n = 32) or greater than or equal to 3/5 grade (n = 28) at initial evaluation. Subjects were further classified based on their Frankel score. Motor incomplete patients with muscle strength less than 3/5 had an average time of recovery to grade 3/5 of 0.9 months (median = 2 weeks), and all seven patients achieved grade 3/5 by two months postinjury. Motor complete patients had an average time of recovery to grade 3/5 of 1.8 months (median = 2 months), and 18 of 25 patients achieved grade 3/5 by two months postinjury (p = 0.1). For muscles greater than or equal to 3/5, motor incomplete subjects had an average time for improvement of one full grade of 1.5 months (median = 2 months), and motor complete subjects had an average time for improvement of one grade of 2.3 months (median = 1 month, p = 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Study 1 analyzed occurrence of spasticity and its severity for 96 subjects at one SCI center, with 67% of subjects developing spasticity by discharge and 37% receiving antispasticity medication. By follow-up, these figures were 78% and 49%, respectively. Incidence of spasticity was higher among cervical and upper thoracic than lower thoracic and lumbosacral levels of injury groups (p less than 0.001). Study 2 analyzed presence of spasticity severe enough to have warranted treatment on 466 subjects at 13 collaborating SCI centers, where 26% of subjects received treatment by discharge and 46% by follow-up. Probability of spasticity treatment was significantly related (p less than 0.05) to days from injury to discharge and level of injury group, whereas age, gender, and Frankel grade were not related. Among only cervical and upper thoracic subjects, Frankel grade was significantly related (p less than 0.01), with grades A (27%) and D (29%) being less frequently treated than grades B (50%) and C (52%). Importance of controlling the above significantly related factors is emphasized for future studies of methods to reduce incidence or severity of spasticity.\r"

  ".W": "The short- and long-term outcome of exercise reconditioning on exercise tolerance and breathlessness scores were evaluated in a group of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After a combined initial program of eight weeks, the patients were randomized into two groups: group A followed a supervised training program for another 12 weeks; group B was discharged after this initial program and received written instructions to continue exercise training at home. The patients were evaluated at the start, after the initial eight weeks' training, after six months, and after one year. For the total group, exercise tolerance, assessed by 12-minute walking distance, increased significantly from 784m to 848m (p less than .05) after the initial program. Neither breathlessness scores nor spirometric data changed significantly. In group A, the increase in exercise tolerance persisted not only at the end of the continued training program but even at the end of the one-year follow-up. In group B, there was a progressive and significant decline of exercise tolerance during the one-year follow-up. Our data confirm that even in severe COPD patients, exercise tolerance can increase significantly without any change in spirometric data and without an increased tolerance for the sensation of dyspnea. A supervised training program must be continued to stabilize the obtained effects because even when an initial improvement is experienced, patients may lack motivation to continue an unsupervised training program.\r"

  ".W": "To develop a field test to estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) in wheelchair users, 30 men (means age = 34.3 years) were subjected to progressive arm-crank ergometer testing with directly measured VO2max. Additionally, they performed a modified 12-minute wheelchair propulsion test for distance. Field testing was conducted within two weeks of the VO2max determination, using a standardized wheelchair (Quickie II) on a 0.1-mile indoor synthetic running track. Average peak power output and VO2max were 540 kg.m.min-1 and 22.0 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively. The mean (+/- 1SD) wheelchair propulsion distance was 1.11 +/- 0.24 miles. Correlation of the field test data with the VO2max was highly significant (r = 0.84; p less than .001). The regression of distance in 12 minutes plotted against VO2max yielded the following equation: wheelchair propulsion (miles) = 0.370 + 0.0337 (VO2max, ml.kg-1.min-1), where the standard error of estimate = 0.13. These findings suggest that field testing can provide a good estimate of VO2max in selected wheelchair users.\r"

This question was studied with the same methodology of those who reported a difference between antidromic and orthodromic latencies, but with control of the interelectrode distance. Twenty-five normal hands were studied. The median and ulnar digital nerves were analyzed both orthodromically and antidromically. There was careful control of interelectrode distance, which was the same for both the recording and stimulating electrodes. Studies were done with both a 3-cm and 4-cm interelectrode distance. Parameters recorded were onset latency, peak latency, terminal latency, and amplitude (baseline to negative peak, and peak to peak). Extensive statistical analysis was performed for all parameters. No differences were found between antidromic and orthodromic studies when the interelectrode distance was the same.\r"

Absolute and interpeak latencies were related to patients' demographics and to stimulation parameters. Factors that correlated with increased numbers of abnormalities included male gender and higher stimulation rates (30 or 40/sec). Patient age and polarity of the stimulus had no major significance; neither did findings on either the right or left side. Overall, the percentage of cases with abnormalities was high (86.2%). This study confirms the importance of BAEPs in patients with vertigo and/or tinnitus. Furthermore, it is recommended that repeated trials be performed using a variety of parameters in order to facilitate the emergence of subtle abnormalities that would otherwise be missed.\r"

Mean MUAP duration for the vocalis muscle was 3.5 msec and 4.4 msec for the cricothyroid. Normal activation patterns are reviewed for each muscle. The results of EMG studies in 18 consecutive patients referred to the EMG laboratory with chronic hoarseness was reviewed. There was good agreement between findings at laryngoscopy and EMG, although more widespread involvement was seen on EMG than was suspected on the basis of laryngoscopy. Vocal cord immobility (apparent paralysis) was not usually accompanied by the total absence of MUAPs. The procedure was well tolerated without local anesthesia and provides information about peripheral nerves which may be of prognostic value.\r"

A case of postpartum unilateral femoral neuropathy in a 29-year-old primigravida is described. The patient's labor was complicated by poor progression, a prolonged second stage (three hours), and midforceps delivery. The patient received both epidural anesthesia (requiring catheter manipulation) and spinal anesthesia. Total time in the dorsal lithotomy position was four hours; total duration of labor was 27 hours. After delivery, the patient experienced buckling at the right knee and numbness down the leg anteriorly. The electromyogram at one month was consistent with an acute femoral neuropathy. Information about other cases of postpartum lower extremity neuropathy was obtained by a retrospective review of all deliveries at a large maternity hospital between 1971 and 1987. Of 143,019 live births, there were three other cases of postpartum knee extensor weakness (2.8/100,000), five cases of postpartum footdrop (3.5/100,000), and two cases of meralgia paresthetica (1.4/100,000). Although the precise mechanism of injury remains unclear, the declining incidence of femoral neuropathy may reflect decreased duration of labor with modern obstetric practices, particularly more frequent Cesarean delivery.\r"

The ratio of maximal cortical to maximal peripheral compound muscle action potential was calculated. Standard statistical parameters were calculated for values from each limb. A paired t-test revealed a statistically significant difference in lower extremity side-to-side amplitude. Regression analysis of patient height vs upper extremity and lower extremity latency demonstrated a strong correlation: r = .720 and r = .601, respectively. A pendulum model demonstrated that a miniscule amount of energy is imparted onto metallic fixation devices by the magnetic coil, but no significant paraspinal activity could be measured in any of five volunteers upon stimulation of the motor cortex. This study has established a normal MES data base that might be useful in evaluating spinal cord injured patients. It has also demonstrated that initial safety concerns about the use of MES in this population are likely unfounded.\r"

A case report of a 28-year-old man with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is presented. This patient had a classic history of calf pain that worsened with walking and was relieved by rest, running, or bicycle riding. Physical examination revealed evidence of ischemia in the distal extremity, and arteriography demonstrated signs of chronic occlusive disease. Early treatment might have included surgical release of the popliteal artery and arterial grafting. Due to extensive vascular disease, grafting was not possible and a below-knee amputation was performed. It is therefore essential to diagnose popliteal artery syndrome early for appropriate management.\r"

A 64-year-old man with a two-month history of left shoulder pain and left arm numbness at the medial aspect of the hand and forearm presented for electrodiagnostic examination, and a severe C8 radiculopathy was documented. Subsequent radiologic evaluation (myelogram and routine chest x-ray) yielded the diagnosis of left apical lung tumor (Pancoast tumor), eroding through the C7 and T1 pedicles and T1 vertebral body, with cut-off of the left C8 nerve root. Pancoast tumor has long been implicated as a cause of brachial plexopathy. The EMG presentation of isolated cervical radiculopathy, however, has not been previously reported, despite the tumor's known tendency for local invasion which may include the nerve roots and even the spinal canal in its advanced stages. This patient's normal sensory studies argue against any significant coexisting lower brachial plexopathy. The possibility of Pancoast lesion should be considered not only in the presence of brachial plexopathy, but also when C8 or T1 radiculopathy is found.\r"

The average hemoglobin value at hospital admission in this group was 126 +/- 18 g/L, with an average drop of 17 +/- 14 g/L during their hospitalization; 14 patients required transfusions averaging 3 U each. Nonoperative treatment was successful in 33 (97%) of 34 patients; one patient whose condition deteriorated clinically underwent splenectomy on the fifth hospital day. These patients have been followed up for an average of 28 months with no sequelae from their splenic injury.

The 1990 projected cost per patient for routine celiotomy has increased 92% over that seen 10 years ago. Selective management protocols using observation, repeated physical examination, and special diagnostic procedures could be instituted for asymptomatic hemodynamically stable patients with truncal stab wounds if appropriate facilities and personnel are available.

All patients in group 3 had hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Mortalities for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 0%, 0%, and 50%, respectively. Although the outcome of patients in groups 1 and 2 was similar, only 60 of 102 patients in group 2 had their treatment completed. Furthermore, 29 (44%) of 65 patients who were followed up in group 2 suffered recurrent pancreatitis or biliary tract disease before elective surgery. The timing of surgery in patients whose conditions improve is not critical; however, patients whose conditions deteriorate after admission have severe disease with high morbidity and mortality.\r"

We evaluated benign and malignant colon tissues for the presence of human papillomavirus infection to determine if a similar relationship exists between human papillomavirus and colon neoplasms. Colon tissues were screened using an immunohistochemical technique to detect human papillomavirus antigen. In situ DNA hybridization was then performed on those tissues that yielded positive results by immunohistochemistry. Groups were compared using chi 2 analysis. Human papillomavirus antigen was present in 23% of normal colon specimens, 60% of benign tumors, and 97% of carcinomas. Human papilloma viral genome was demonstrated in 27% of benign tumors and in nearly 43% of all carcinomas tested. These data indicate that human papillomavirus infects the columnar mucosa of the colon, and that an association exists between human papillomavirus and colon neoplasia.\r"

Eleven such patients, 10 with a previously treated colorectal carcinoma and 1 with a previously treated breast carcinoma, received an injection of the anticarcinoembryonic antigen monoclonal antibody ZCE-025 labeled with the radioisotope indium 111. Nuclear scintigraphy was performed on days 3 and 5 through 7 to detect potential sites of tumor recurrence. The monoclonal antibody scan accurately predicted the presence or absence of occult malignancy in 7 (64%) patients. Second-look laparotomy confirmed the monoclonal antibody scan results in the patients with colorectal cancer, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed metastatic breast cancer. This study demonstrates that In-ZCE-025 can localize occult carcinoma and may assist the surgeon in facilitating the operative exploration. In-ZCE-025 assisted in the initiation of adjuvant therapy for the patient with breast cancer.\r"

During the first 24 hours after operation, there were large decreases in the results of spirometric tests of pulmonary reserve (forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), but these decrements were consistently significantly smaller in the limited-incision group. Other tests of pulmonary function (mid-expiratory phase forced expiratory flow, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, and PaCO2), however, demonstrated similar postoperative changes in both groups. Similarly, there were no differences in pain scores, postoperative morphine requirements, complications, or length of hospital stay. Use of the limited muscle-sparing incision resulted in improved postoperative pulmonary reserve, but this did not translate into differences in other measures of postoperative convalescence.\r"

One patient with functioning grafts died at 10 months owing to a cardiac arrhythmia and one pancreas was \"lost\" to early thrombosis. Major morbidity was due to pancreas wound infection (53%) that required reoperation, but all patients have had subsequent healing of their wounds. Rehabilitation with return to meaningful activity has been accomplished by 15 patients. This experience demonstrates that combined kidney and pancreas transplantation can be performed safely and successfully.\r"

Median follow-up was 80 months; none of the patients received adjuvant therapy. The relative prognostic importance of clinical variables, ploidy, and S-phase fraction was analyzed by Cox multivariate analysis. Ploidy was analyzable for 198 tumors and did not predict survival. Nuclear grade predicted disease-free survival for all patients. For 71 patients with diploid tumors, only high S-phase had a statistically significant association with relapse. For 127 patients with aneuploid tumors, tumor diameter predicted both disease-free survival and cancer death; histologic grade was also significant for predicting disease-free survival. In conclusion, flow cytometric determination of ploidy and S-phase fraction can provide valuable predictive information in node-negative breast cancer in addition to conventional variables.\r"

To evaluate the efficacy of a combined physical, mammographic, and fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination, 113 women were prospectively evaluated. Breast masses were listed as either benign or suspicious/malignant. All patients underwent a subsequent biopsy. Fifty-two (46%) of 113 patients had a malignant mass. The sensitivity and specificity of the individual tests were as follows: 96% and 66% for the physical examination; 94% and 73% for the mammographic examination; 90% and 93% for the fine-needle aspiration cytologic examination. For the 86 patients who underwent all three studies, the 25 patients with benign test results on all three examinations had a benign pathologic result. One (6%) of 18 patients with a single suspicious/malignant test result had cancer, 9 (64%) of 14 patients with two suspicious/malignant test results and 28 (97%) of 29 patients with three suspicious/malignant results also had breast cancer. We conclude that the combined triad of physical, mammographic, and fine-needle aspiration cytologic examinations is highly accurate in the diagnosis of breast masses, and patients in whom all three examination results are benign can be safely observed, obviating the need for an open biopsy.\r"

The mortality (0%) and morbidity (35% urinary complications, 25% wound disruptions, 1600-mL median blood loss) compare favorably with reports in the literature. Long-term survival was achieved with primary tumors of the sacrum. Local control of disease was achieved in the majority of patients with rectal cancer, with good palliation of preoperative pain. Long-term survival, however, is rare in this group. Surgical resection of sacral tumors can be undertaken with acceptable morbidity and mortality in selected patients.\r"

Acute ileus due to steroid withdrawal caused symptoms of intestinal obstruction in 43 patients (76 episodes), whereas true mechanical small-bowel obstruction occurred in only 17 patients (19 episodes). Symptoms of both conditions were similar; however, hypoactive bowel sounds, acute onset of emotional depression, no evidence of obstruction on radiologic contrast stomatogram or enema, and prompt relief of symptoms within 4 hours after intravenous administration of hydrocortisone acetate distinguished acute steroid withdrawal. Since ileus from acute steroid withdrawal occurred four times as frequently as mechanical small-bowel obstruction, prompt recognition and treatment should appreciably reduce postoperative morbidity and hospital costs.\r"

The patients were classified according to Ranson's criteria. Eighteen patients with moderate or severe pancreatitis had higher maximum plasma C3a/C3adesArg and TCC concentrations than 19 patients with mild pancreatitis. During convalescence, the concentrations had returned to normal. High concentrations of C5a/C5adesArg and TCC were also found in ascites and pancreatic cyst fluid, drawn from patients with moderate or severe pancreatitis. As the terminal complement pathway activation is involved in reactive lysis and anaphylatoxins increase vascular permeability, anemia and impaired respiration in these patients may be influenced by complement activation.\r"

The animals that received 1 ng twice daily for 7 days had improved survival in comparison with the controls (IL-1 alpha vs control, 70.8% vs 20.8%). The animals that received a single injection of 1000 ng after a bacterial challenge with 10(4) P aeruginosa of IL-1 alpha had fewer positive blood cultures at 48 hours compared with the controls (57% vs 89%). In addition, the animals that received 100 ng of IL-1 alpha had significantly increased absolute neutrophil counts at 6, 24, and 48 hours after thermal injury and bacterial challenge with 10(3) colony-forming units of P aeruginosa. The use of cytokines to modulate the host response to injury or infection may lead to additional strategies to improve the outcome following burn injury.\r"

These levels were approximately twice those obtained with a 10-mg/kg dose. The corneal concentrations correlated highly with serum levels (r = .89). A steady accumulation in both normal corneas and corneas infected with Candida albicans was noted when 17.5 mg/kg of fluconazole was administered twice daily over a 5-day period. Drug levels did not increase in the cornea when fluconazole was administered as a single daily dose of 35 mg/kg. In view of its excellent ocular pharmacokinetic profile, fluconazole merits further attention as an orally administered agent for ocular fungal infections.\r"

The immunotoxin 454A12 MAB-rRA is composed of a murine monoclonal antibody, specific for the human transferrin receptor, and is chemically linked to recombinant ricin A chain, a cellular toxin. The rapidly proliferating cells take up the immunotoxin, but non-proliferating cells do not. Using a collagen-gel medium to simulate the vitreous, we have studied the effect of the immunotoxin on fibroblast proliferation in vitro. Exposure of the fibroblasts to 1000 ng of immunotoxin per milliliter of the collagen gel medium for 10 minutes kills 96% or more of the cells for 20 days. These in vitro data indicate that the immunotoxin is effective in an environment similar to the vitreous; however, in vivo studies will be necessary to prove if it is a suitable agent for the long-term prevention of cell proliferation in the human eye.\r"

Glaucomatous nerve heads showed increased labeling for collagen type IV along the margins of beams in the lamina cribrosa, due to accumulation of basement membrane-like materials. We also noted material in the pores of the laminar beams that labeled with antibodies to collagen types I, III and IV, but not elastin. In transected eyes, increased type IV labeling of laminar beam margins resulted solely from redundant astrocyte basement membranes. Extracellular matrix deposition within laminar pores was not observed following optic nerve transection; hence this may be a selective response to elevated intraocular pressure. This response may alter the biochemical composition of the lamina cribrosa and its function in patients with elevated intraocular pressure.\r"

Predisposing conditions leading to perforation were an infectious keratitis in 26 eyes (57%), trauma in 14 eyes (30%), and corneal melt associated with ocular surface disorder in 6 eyes (13%). The success of penetrating keratoplasty in the treatment of corneal perforation depended on the timing of surgery and the cause of the perforation. If the perforation was traumatic in origin, delaying surgery for at least 3 months significantly improved the chances for graft success. Eighty percent of the penetrating keratoplasties delayed 3 months following primary repair of corneal laceration remained clear, and 50% of these patients had a visual acuity of 20/60 or better. If penetrating keratoplasties were performed for an infectious corneal perforation, grafts had a better chance to remain clear if surgery could be delayed. All grafts performed for corneal perforation associated with melting and ocular surface abnormalities failed.\r"

Both patients had previously been treated with subconjunctival and/or oral corticosteroids for presumed sterile endophthalmitis. Vitreous cultures in each case yielded pure growth of a diphtheroid that was subsequently identified as coryneform group A-4. The clinical response to standard intraocular therapy with gentamicin and cefazolin was delayed, although both patients eventually had restoration of functional vision. A comparison of the antibiotic minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations of the isolates may help to explain the delayed response to therapy seen in these two patients.\r"

A qualitative classification system for corneal topography was derived based on patterns seen on color-coded topographic maps. Corneas were classified into groups by three independent masked ophthalmologists based on this system. Patterns included round (22.6%), oval (20.8%), symmetric bow tie (17.5%), asymmetric bow tie (32.1%), and irregular (7.1%). All corneas were steeper centrally and flatter peripherally. There was a statistically significant difference among patterns for keratometric astigmatism, but not for spherical equivalent refraction, mean keratometric power, or age of subject. Classification of normal corneal topography is an important step in the process of characterizing the shape of normal and pathologic corneas.\r"

Histopathologic evaluation of the corneal button demonstrated a thinned central epithelium and folds and keratocytes in Bowman's layer consistent with keratoconus. Central guttata, subepithelial bullae, and a decreased number of endothelial cells, consistent with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, were also seen. This case demonstrates that two distinct familial corneal diseases can occur in the same patient. Although one cannot conclude inheritance patterns based on this limited evaluation, the findings in this family support previous observations that keratoconus can be familial, and that Fuchs' corneal dystrophy has a female predilection with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern.\r"

Surgical complications included variable-sized coagulations and microperforations in two eyes. Light microscopy disclosed that the burns were 90% in depth and healing occurred by epithelial ingrowth. The stroma surrounding the coagulation was acellular early but keratocyte repopulation was apparent by 30 days. A retrocorneal membrane four to five cells thick was noted at the early time points; however, by 30 days only a double layer of spindle-shaped cells remained. By electron microscopy, damage to surrounding endothelial cells was estimated to be 300 microns (from the center of the coagulation). Our results suggest that radial thermokeratoplasty, which utilizes a temperature of 600 degrees C placed within the cornea to a depth of 90%, will cause significant damage to the corneal endothelium beneath and surrounding the coagulation site.\r"

A significant relationship appeared between functional disability (determined by the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire) and sex, age at disease onset, and the number of peripheral joints involved. Using a life-table approach, the probability of prolonged sick leaves was associated with peripheral joint involvement and work that involved carrying heavy loads. Long-term disability was more frequent after work involving exposure to cold conditions (relative risk [RR] = 2.01) and prolonged standing postures (RR = 1.34), while sedentary work (RR = 0.35) and formal vocational rehabilitation programs (RR = 0.57) seemed to protect against long-term disability.\r"

We conducted a prospective study in which serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R), IL-1 alpha, and IL-2 were correlated with creatine kinase (CK) levels and clinical disease activity. Cytokines and IL-2R were quantitated in 133 serum samples from 14 patients by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In patients with acute PM (9 patients), soluble IL-2R and IL-1 alpha levels were elevated initially, but declined rapidly with therapy. A significant linear relationship was found between soluble IL-2R levels and CK levels. IL-2 was initially detectable in only 3 patients, and it disappeared with therapy in all 3. The levels of cytokines and IL-2R were consistently normal in patients with inactive PM (2 patients). In patients with chronic PM (3 patients), the cytokines and soluble IL-2R levels were normal despite persistently abnormal CK levels and/or muscle weakness. Cellular IL-2R levels correlated positively with serum levels of soluble IL-2R. Our studies substantiate a pathogenic role for cellular immunity in PM, with the finding of activation of lymphocytes. The finding of increased levels of IL-1 alpha demonstrates for the first time that there is monocyte activation in PM. Persistent elevation of CK levels after normalization of the levels of cytokines and IL-2R may be prognostic of impending chronic disease. Serum soluble IL-2R appear to be a sensitive indicator of improvement or exacerbation of disease activity in patients with PM.\r"

In view of the successful treatment of these diseases, we initiated a pilot study of the effect of IV gamma globulin in systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Eight patients with active systemic JRA that was unresponsive to first-line agents, second-line agents, and/or corticosteroids received this therapy monthly for 6 months. Outcome measures included changes in articular and extraarticular features, steroid dosage, and laboratory parameters. Following IV gamma globulin therapy, there was significant improvement in arthritis and/or morning stiffness in 5 of 8 patients, while extraarticular features significantly improved in 7 of 8 patients. At study entry, 6 of 8 patients were receiving prednisone; at study end, prednisone was discontinued in 3 patients and decreased by more than 50% in the other 3. Overall, there was an 80% reduction in the prednisone dosage. Initially, all patients had anemia, low levels of serum albumin, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while a thrombocytosis was seen in 7 of 8 patients. Serum IgG was initially elevated in 6 patients. IV gamma globulin therapy resulted in a significant increase in hemoglobin and albumin levels and a significant decrease in the mean serum IgG level, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In only 1 patient did IV gamma globulin fail to significantly improve the clinical or laboratory features of the disease. We suggest that this therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of systemic JRA.\r"

We investigated in vivo changes in intraarticular substance P and the degradation of cartilage proteoglycan in response to intraarticular cytokine injections in rabbits. Twenty-four hours after a single injection of 10 ng, 30 ng, or 100 ng of recombinant human IL-1 alpha (rHuIL-1 alpha) per joint, the mean +/- SEM levels of substance P detected in the cell-free joint lavage fluid were 250 +/- 67 fmoles, 480 +/- 60 fmoles, and 530 +/- 130 fmoles (n = 4-5), respectively. The level of substance P in the contralateral knees injected with diluent was 58 +/- 8 fmoles (n = 12). The level of substance P had increased by 2 hours after IL-1 injection and remained elevated in the joint 48 hours after injection. Cytokine-induced proteoglycan depletion was also time- and dose-dependent. Proteoglycan concentrations in articular cartilage dissected from the weight-bearing condyles were calculated as the ratio of sulfated glycosaminoglycan measured using 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue: hydroxyproline. After 48 hours, 10 ng, 30 ng, or 100 ng of rHuIL-1 alpha per joint decreased proteoglycan levels by 9 +/- 4%, 14 +/- 4%, and 21 +/- 3% (n = 8), respectively. Likewise, the injection of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha induced depletion of intraarticular substance P and cartilage proteoglycan.\r"

Animals fed diets containing the highest amounts of these fatty acids (10% menhaden fish oil) demonstrated a 70% maximum decrease in the linoleic and arachidonic acid content of articular cartilage, a 30-40% decrease in cartilage hexosamine content, with little effect on hydroxyproline levels, and a 32% inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis. Histologic analysis revealed an occasional surface irregularity and localized depletion of Safranin O and toluidine blue staining of articular cartilage on the femoral heads from animals taking the higher doses. Electron microscopic analysis revealed a marked decrease in \"dark-staining\" chondrocytes relative to \"light-staining\" cells in all animals fed menhaden fish oil. The cartilaginous changes noted in this study reflect a causal relationship between chondrocyte metabolism and an altered unsaturated fatty acid content. The observed responses of chondrocytes to omega 3 fatty acids may be similar to those commonly associated with the development of early osteoarthrosis. It is not known whether similar changes are induced in other species, including humans, but these observations suggest that some caution must be taken in the long-term administration of menhaden fish oil or other omega 3 fatty acid-containing preparations in rheumatoid arthritis patients.\r"

In 52 HLA-DR4+ RA patients, Dw4 was the predominant subtype. This subtype was found in 45 of 52 patients (86.5%) compared with 33 of 59 DR4+ controls (55.9%; P less than 0.001). In the whole population, Dw4 also gave the highest relative risk for RA (RR = 5.31). Relative risk was also associated with DR1.1, the common white DR1 (Dw1) type, which has a third hypervariable region amino acid sequence similar to some forms of DR4 and has glycine at position 86. Variants of DR1 (DR1.2) or DR4 (Dw13.1, Dw14.1) with valine at position 86 appeared less able to confer risk for RA. Substitution of residues in the third hypervariable region of the first domain of DRB1 appeared to correlate with relative risk for RA. Among subjects having 0-1 amino acid substitutions, RA developed in 53%, whereas in subjects with 2-4 amino acid changes, RA was present in only 17.4% (P less than 0.00001). DQw7 (formerly DQw3.1) was slightly increased in DR4+ RA patients compared with controls, but a striking excess of Dw4,DQw7 homozygous patients was observed. The results suggest that DQw7 may have an additional effect, possibly with a recessive mechanism, since it was observed only in DR4 homozygous patients.\r"

During 8 years of followup, 217 incident cases of polyarthritis were ascertained (115 RA and 102 undifferentiated polyarthritis). When compared with women who had never used oral contraceptives, the age-adjusted relative risk was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.3) for past users; however, too few women were currently using oral contraceptives for a reliable estimate of its effect. Among postmenopausal women, 123 cases of RA were reported. Compared with postmenopausal women who never used replacement estrogens, current users had an age-adjusted relative risk of 1.3 (95% CI 0.9-2.0), past users had an age-adjusted relative risk of 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-1.2), and ever users had a relative risk of 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.4). These data do not show a protective effect of past use of oral contraceptives or replacement estrogens for RA; however, a modest protective effect of current oral contraceptive use cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "The mode of action of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. The effects of MTX are mediated primarily through inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in a dose-dependent inhibition of purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Other folate-dependent metabolic pathways might be secondarily affected. One such pathway is the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine, with subsequent formation of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and polyamines, which are important in cell-mediated immune reactions. To assess whether MTX inhibits SAM and polyamine synthesis in lymphocytes, pokeweed mitogen-stimulated mononuclear cells from healthy donors were incubated with MTX. This resulted in decreased proliferation and IgG, IgM, and IgM rheumatoid factor synthesis. However, addition of folinic acid, methionine, SAM, or spermidine resulted in reversal of the MTX-mediated inhibition. These data suggest that MTX inhibits the folate-dependent pathway of methionine regeneration, thereby inhibiting SAM and polyamine synthesis. Since RA lymphocytes have increased concentrations of polyamines, the beneficial effects of MTX in RA may be related to its potential ability to reduce polyamine synthesis.\r"

Multivariate analysis showed that only a chronicity index greater than 3 was predictive for decreased renal survival, while age greater than 31 years at biopsy and a chronicity index greater than 3 were associated with decreased patient survival. Clinical tests of renal function were not reliable in discriminating between active lesions and chronic renal damage.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have shown an increased frequency of certain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) markers, including HLA-DR2, DR3, and C4AQ0 (C4A-null), in Caucasian patients. However, most of these studies were of randomly selected, unrelated patients; families were not included, and haplotypes were not determined. In order to define more accurately the possible role of MHC genes in lupus susceptibility, HLA-A, B, C, and DR, as well as BF, C2, C4A, C4B, and GLO, markers were determined in 62 Caucasian patients of known ethnic background, and in the members of their families. The distributions of extended haplotypes (fixed combinations of HLA-B, DR, and complotype alleles), fragments thereof, and individual alleles were determined in SLE patients and controls. The MHC distributions in all patients were compared with haplotypes in a normal Caucasian population. There were no statistically significant differences between the frequencies of any MHC marker, fragment, or extended haplotype in the patients compared with the controls. The patients were categorized into 2 groups of European ancestry (English/Irish; other Europeans), and each group was compared with a group of ethnically matched controls. There was a statistically significantly increased frequency of the alleles C4AQ0 and DR3 and the complotype SC01 in SLE patients of English/Irish descent as compared with ethnically matched controls. The increase in C4AQ0 and DR3 could be accounted for by the fact that they were part of the extended haplotype [HLA-B8;SC01;DR3] and/or its fragment (SC01;DR3). No increase in any MHC marker was observed in the other patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies have shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased number of circulating Epstein-Barr virus-infected B lymphocytes and elevated titers of antibody to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), the major nuclear antigen expressed in latently infected B cells. However, it is not known whether antibodies from RA patients recognize the same epitopes as antibodies from normal subjects. are directed at the glycine-alanine repeating region of the molecule. Antibodies specific for this region are also somewhat more prevalent in RA patients than in normal subjects. A panel of synthetic peptides derived from EBNA-1 was used to analyze the immune response to antigenic epitopes outside the glycine-alanine region, using the peptides as solid-phase antigen. Sera from RA patients and from systemic lupus erythematosus patients contained elevated levels of IgG antibodies to 2 non-glycine-alanine peptide and to 3 non-glycine-alanine peptides, respectively. Two of the 3 peptides are glycine-rich, but antibodies that react with them are distinct from each other, as well as from those that react with the glycine-alanine epitope. Eight other peptides from the C-terminal portion of EBNA-1 either do not react with sera or show no difference between normal subjects and patient groups. The antibodies to the glycine-alanine peptide are enriched with kappa light chains, whereas antibodies to epitopes outside the glycine-alanine region are not so restricted among kappa and lambda light chains. Thus, RA patients and systemic lupus erythematosus patients have different antibody responses than do normal subjects, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\r"

  ".U": "90066616\r", 
  ".W": "Infants with birth weights under 750 g are disproportionately represented in perinatal mortality and morbidity rates. We reviewed the outcomes of 98 infants delivered at our perinatal center between July 1982 and June 1985 (period 1) whose lengths of gestation were 20 or more weeks and whose birth weights were under 750 g, and compared them with the outcomes of 129 such infants born between July 1985 and June 1988 (period 2). The frequency of cesarean section increased from 12 to 19 percent between the two periods. During the entire six-year period, 12 percent of the infants with birth weights under 500 g were intubated, as compared with 28 percent of those between 500 and 599 g, 60 percent of those between 600 and 699 g, and 90 percent of those between 700 and 749 g. The frequency of endotracheal intubation increased between the two periods only for infants with birth weights above 500 g (P less than 0.02). Despite more aggressive treatment, survival did not change, although the mean time to death among infants transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit increased from 73 to 880 hours. Among all live-born infants with birth weights under 750 g, the rate of survival was 20 percent during period 1 and 18 percent during period 2, but 48 and 43 percent of those transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit survived in the two periods reviewed. Neonatal morbidity also did not change. Among survivors at a corrected age of 20 months, 4 of 18 born during period 1 and 7 of 14 born during period 2 had moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment. When all live-born infants of less than 28 weeks' gestation were considered, only 8 percent of those born at 23 weeks survived, as compared with 16 percent of those born at 24 weeks, and 53, 63, and 72 percent of those born at 25, 26, 27 weeks, respectively. Thus, despite a tendency to perform more cesarean sections and active resuscitations, no improvement in the survival of babies with lengths of gestation below 25 weeks or birth weights under 750 g was observed. The probability of survival is very poor if the length of gestation is less than 24 weeks or the birth weight less than 600 g.\r"

The frequency of medical and surgical indications for barbiturates and benzodiazepines or other minor tranquillizers as well as the use of such drugs were compared among different groups of patients and specialty wards. Of the patients 29% had a regular order and 40% had a PRN order; only 77% of the PRN orders were administered. A total of 215 patients (45%) received an SHD during their hospital stay, and 160 (34%) received the drug as a hypnotic. Medical indications accounted for 49% of the regular orders but only 2% of the PRN orders; moreover, 89% of all the PRN orders were for insomnia. On average, patients receiving SHDs as hypnotics were older (p less than 0.05) and stayed longer in hospital (p less than 0.01) than those who did not; however, no patient on the geriatric or pediatric ward received an SHD as a hypnotic during the hospital stay. The differences in use between patient groups may have been influenced by orientation of ward staff. Physicians should review their rationale for prescribing hypnotics and avoid routine orders on admission.\r"

The lesions were evaluated for height, surface characteristics, color, and length with the use of 7X calibrated loupe, a template, skin replicas, and scanning electron microscopy. Lac-Hydrin 12% lotion significantly reduced the height (elevation) of seborrheic keratoses, and two seborrheic keratoses cleared completely; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the length, color, and surface characteristics between the study group and the control group. Skin replicas and scanning electron microscopy can be used to evaluate lesion surface characteristics, dimensions, and therapeutic effects.\r"

Two and three week placebo periods preceded and followed active treatment, respectively. Relative to baseline, significant increases in sodium excretion (intake) of 31%, 53% and 30% were observed in subjects receiving HCTZ after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, respectively. An identical follow-up study with 16 subjects replicated the sodium excretion (intake) findings, but failed to reveal the source of the extra dietary sodium. Doubling the dose of amiloride in 11 additional subjects led to higher aldosterone excretion relative to thiazide-treated subjects, but did not increase salt excretion (intake) over a four week period. Only amiloride-treated subjects displayed significant increases in salt taste sensitivity. The increased sodium intake in HCTZ-treated patients may partially offset the desired effects of therapy and exacerbate potassium wasting.\r"

Ingestion of calcium carbonate failed to reduce systemic blood pressure, but was associated with increased proteinuria and morphologic evidence of glomerular injury. Micropuncture studies revealed that afferent arteriolar resistance was reduced and glomerular capillary pressure further increased in the high calcium group. Thus, calcium carbonate, in moderate amounts, not only failed to ameliorate systemic hypertension but, paradoxically, worsened intrarenal hypertension and injury in rats with mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The roles of dietary and behavioral factors in the etiology of hypertension are not well understood. Vulnerability to hypertension is thought to be affected by a complex interaction of nutritional, genetic, neurophysiological, and psychosocial influences. We studied cardiovascular reactivity to sodium and stress in a group of 29 normotensive young men who were vulnerable to hypertension by virtue of familial and/or racial factors. Subjects with positive and negative parental histories of hypertension were provided all meals for five days during which blood pressure was monitored before each meal. Two groups were given 300 mEq/day dietary sodium with either 1100 mg/day or 410 mg/day dietary calcium. A third group consumed a 10mEq sodium diet with low dietary calcium. On the fifth day of the diet all subjects were tested for cardiovascular reactivity using a modified Stroop test as a mentally challenging task. Adaptation of systolic blood pressure (SBP) from the first to the fifth breakfast was most pronounced in subjects consuming high calcium with high sodium. Perseveration of SBP reactivity to repeated mental challenge was found in subjects who consumed high sodium with low calcium and in subjects with positive parental histories of hypertension. The perseverative phenomenon was particularly well-defined in subjects who had the highest urinary excretion of calcium. Our findings suggest a prophylactic influence of dietary calcium and its retention on cardiovascular reactivity to sodium and stress. We also elucidate a theoretical proposition concerning the role of neurophysiological inhibitory capacity in the transition from normotension to the chronic dysregulatory state of essential hypertension.\r"

Consequently, we have assessed the effects of calcium supplementation on forearm blood flow (FBF) and vascular resistance (FVR) and left ventricular mass (LVM) in seven type II diabetic hypertensive black men with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) maintained off antihypertensive treatment for four weeks and then supplemented with 600 mg calcium per day for three months. A comparable group of black diabetic hypertensive patients treated with atenolol (50 mg) served as controls. LVM was determined by M-mode echocardiography and FBF and FVR by electrical impedance plethysmography at the end of the four week baseline and the 12 week supplementation periods. Calcium supplementation resulted in a decrease (P less than .05) in mean arterial pressure (from 121 +/- 4 to 114 +/- 3 mm Hg) which was accompanied by an 18% increase in FBF and a 20% reduction in FVR (P less than .05). LVM decreased from 289 +/- 22 at baseline to 240 +/- 22 g at the end of the supplementation period (P less than .02) and there was a significant correlation between changes in FBF and LVM (r = 0.82). Left ventricular end diastolic dimension decreased by 11% (P less than .05). These data indicate that calcium supplementation sufficient to normalize dietary calcium in black hypertensive diabetic men significantly reduces vascular resistance and causes partial regression of LVH.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril sodium on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was investigated in 8 patients with moderate essential hypertension. A constant dose of chlorthalidone (25 mg/day) was given to stimulate the renin angiotensin system, and fosinopril sodium was given in incremental doses (10 to 40 mg/day) with the aim of obtaining a diastolic blood pressure at or below 90 mm Hg. Regional CBF was measured with xenon-133 inhalation tomography. Repetitive measurements were made at the start of treatment and again after 4 to 12 weeks treatment in the resting supine position, and during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a substitute for the upright position. Four hours after the first 10 mg dose of fosinopril the mean arterial pressure (MAP) had been reduced from 127 +/- 13 mm Hg to 105 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than .01) without any significant change in mean CBF (55 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) at baseline versus 52 +/- 9 mL/(100 g X min) after fosinopril). After prolonged treatment with chlorthalidone and fosinopril, mean CBF was still unchanged from baseline levels, when measured 4 and 24 h after a single dose of fosinopril, despite a 10% reduction in MAP (P less than .01). LBNP did not lead to any significant change in rCBF. The regional distribution of CBF was normal in all patients throughout the study. We conclude that treatment with fosinopril sodium causes a moderate fall in blood pressure without any adverse effects on rCBF.\r"

The V1-ag, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)Tyr(NH2)AVP was modified by radiomonoiodination of d(CH2)5-Tyr(Me)Tyr(NH2)AVP with the Iodogen technique, and derivatization of d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)Tyr[125I](NH2)-AVP with the photoreactive crosslinker, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate (HSAB) (each step included HPLC purification). In competition experiments, the affinity of these V1-ag for the human platelet AVP receptors remained excellent: [table: see text] Irreversible photoaffinity labeling of the platelet V1-vascular AVP receptor was successfully achieved by UV lamp exposure (365 nm, 20 min). Thus, AzBz-d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)Tyr[125I](NH2)AVP is a promising tool to use for the purification of human V1-vascular AVP receptors.\r"

Systolic and diastolic changes in pressure and diameter were used to calculate Peterson and incremental elastic moduli. Acute hypertension was induced using infusions of epinephrine during the control period and later propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) plus atropine (0.2 mg/kg). Percent variations of mean aortic diameter were correlated to percent variations in mean aortic pressure in the control period and after autonomic blockade (P less than .001). The slopes of these correlations in the control group were higher than after autonomic blockade (P less than .05). Correlations were also found between Peterson and incremental elastic moduli and mean pressure in the control group and after autonomic blockade (P less than .001). The slopes of the correlations of incremental elastic modulus and Peterson's modulus versus mean aortic pressure were lower in the control group than after blockade (P less than .001). We conclude that in conscious dogs, autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine decreased the distension and increased the stiffness of the aortic wall in response to acute hypertension mediated by epinephrine.\r"

Thus, a high K diet strongly protects against an NaCl-induced rise of blood pressure as well as stroke deaths in these SHR rats. Hence the level of dietary K determines the degree of NaCl sensitivity in these SHR rats.\r"

The possibility that calcium antagonists affect extracellular fluid volume partition was tested by comparing the effects of nicardipine (Nic), diltiazem (Dil) and Vehicle (Veh) on hematocrit and plasma protein concentration in anephric anesthetized rats. In response to a 45 min infusion of Nic (0.1 or 1 micrograms/kg/min) and Dil (10 or 100 micrograms/kg/min), blood pressure decreased by 4 or 21%, and 4 or 19%, respectively, whereas hematocrit increased only with both doses of Nic (5.3 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2%). Plasma protein concentration also increased significantly, although slightly, in the Nic group. The possibility of protein extravasation was then assessed using Evans blue dye as a marker. The drug-induced extravasation of dyed albumin in skeletal and cardiac muscles, but not other organs, was significantly increased following Nic, as compared to Dil or Veh. These observations suggest that two structurally different calcium antagonists used at equihypotensive doses may exert different effects on extracellular fluid partition.\r"

The relationship was apparent over the whole range of blood pressures and urinary electrolyte excretions. An age gradient was apparent for systolic pressure in both men and women, the regression slope for blood pressure versus sodium/potassium ratio being steeper with increasing age. The regression slope overall was approximately 4 mm Hg systolic and 1 mm Hg diastolic pressure increase per unit increase in sodium/potassium (mmol/mmol) ratio. The use of casual urine samples in assessing the blood pressure and sodium/potassium relationship should not be prematurely dismissed. Evidence from this and other studies suggests the relationship between blood pressure and electrolyte intake in the population may be more dynamic than previously believed, and also more marked in the old, who are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease. A reduction in the age-related increase in blood pressure has considerable implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\r"

In two individuals there were findings compatible with a classical telogen effluvium, but these had atypical features. The main finding in the study was an increase in the plucked telogen count, maximal at 12 weeks. As an arrest in the onset of anagen could produce only a comparatively small telogen increase, the predominant cause of this increase was a decrease in the duration of anagen. In two subjects there was also evidence of a telogen anchorage defect.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study was made of the histopathology of axillary skin excised from 12 patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. In the majority of cases (10 out of 12), squamous epithelium-lined structures, in the form of cysts or sinuses were identified in the dermis. Laminated keratin was present in all these structures and half of the cysts also contained hair shafts, suggesting that they are derived from hair follicles. Only a small proportion of cases (4 out of 12) displayed inflammation in apocrine glands, and in these the inflammation was also seen around eccrine glands, hair follicles and the epithelium-lined structures. However, in cases where the epithelium of the 'cysts' was disrupted, the inflammatory infiltrate appeared to be centred around these areas. These observations suggest that the squamous epithelium-lined structures, which probably represent abnormal dilated hair follicles, are a more constant diagnostic feature in hidradenitis suppurativa than inflammation of apocrine glands which appears to be a secondary phenomenon.\r"

Short chain fatty acids were found in greater amounts from those subjects with strong foot odour. Iso-valeric acid was present in all the subjects with foot odour but was not detected in those without. Olfactory evaluations of the various short-chain fatty acid solutions were in agreement with the GC/MS analyses. By incubating sweat and lipid from subjects with strong foot odour, we succeeded in reproducing the foot malodour. GC/MS analyses of reproduced foot odour revealed that short-chain fatty acids were present in a similar composition to that found in vivo.\r"

Crude aqueous extracts of whole telogen mouse skin (TE), anagen skin (AE) or vehicle alone (V) were injected intraperitoneally into mice in which anagen had previously been induced by plucking of telogen hair follicles. Injection of TE, but not AE or V, significantly retarded the development of anagen follicles, as measured by macroscopic and quantitative microscopic hair growth parameters (skin pigmentation and thickness, appearance of trichohyaline granules) and the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into mouse skin from animals previously treated with either TE or V (skin organ culture). This inhibitory activity seemed to be localized to the epidermis and was also present in rat epidermis. We suggest that this apparently non-species-specific inhibitor present in telogen skin may play a role in regulating the hair cycle in rodents.\r"

LS was characterized by a decreased skin extensibility with thickening of the skin in progressive lesions. There was an increase in the cutaneous microcirculation with a decrease in the PO2. In PSS, there was a decrease in the skin extensibility caused by thickening of the skin, but no change in cutaneous microcirculation or PO2 values. These results indicate that skin thickness and extensibility are the most useful parameters in the study of the progression of LS and PSS.\r"

SLS (7.5%) was applied without occlusion for 20 min once daily, over a period of 3 weeks (5 days a week) on dansyl chloride-stained skin and on untreated skin. SCTT of untreated skin (19.3 +/- 0.8 days; mean +/- SEM) was not changed by daily treatment with water (control) (19.3 +/- 2.0) but was significantly reduced by SLS (10.9 +/- 0.6; P less than or equal to 0.0001; compared to controls). However, TEWL was increased in SLS-treated sites 1.5-fold after 4 days of treatment (5.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.5 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.001). At the end of the second week, TEWL was increased 2.6-fold and after 3 weeks TEWL was 3.3 times higher than in controls 13.0 +/- 1.6 vs. 3.9, P less than or equal to 0.0001). The intensity of SLS-induced irritation as measured by TEWL was significantly correlated with baseline TEWL (r = 0.50; P less than or equal to 0.02) and significantly negatively correlated with SCTT of SLS treated sites (r = -50; P less than or equal to 0.02) but not with SCTT of untreated skin (r = 0.19).\r"
