Of the available treatments, the most common are intermittent hydrodilation of the bladder and intermittent intravesical instillation of dimethyl sulfoxide. Other methods and medications are currently under investigation. Although interstitial cystitis is uncommon, its potentially devastating effects may be modified or even averted if primary care physicians are familiar with its presentation and maintain a high index of suspicion.\r"

  ".W": "The proteolipid subunit c of F1F0-type H(+)-transporting ATP synthases [ATP phosphohydrolase (H(+)-transporting), EC 3.6.1.34] contains a conserved Asp/Glu residue that is thought to function in H+ translocation. To test the importance of the position of this residue in the Escherichia coli enzyme, we used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to move the carboxyl side chain from position 61 to position 58, 60, or 62. Mutant cells with these changes were incapable of growth via oxidative phosphorylation on succinate. An Asp-61----Glu mutant grew on succinate but at 50% the efficiency of wild type. Hence, even minor changes in the position of the carboxyl group can significantly reduce function. In a second approach, slow-growing revertants to an Asp-61----Gly mutant were isolated. In one such revertant, Ala-24 was changed to Asp, while the original Asp-61----Gly mutation remained unchanged. The Asp-24-Gly-61 double mutant grew on succinate at 60% the efficiency of wild type. Hence the essential carboxyl group of subunit c can function when anchored at either position 24 or position 61, and this supports the idea that these residues may neighbor each other when subunit c is folded in the membrane. The rate of ATP-driven H+ translocation by mutant membrane vesicles was estimated by the quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine fluorescence and corresponded to actual H+ pumping rates less than 25% that of wild type.\r"

The locus consists of alternative sequences called A and a. The A mating-type DNA sequence of Neurospora crassa is composed of a region of 5301 base pairs that has little similarity to the sequence present at the mating-type locus in an a mating-type strain. However, the sequences flanking the mating-type locus in the A haploid and a haploid genome are essentially identical. The region of the A mating-type sequence required for expression of the heterokaryon incompatibility and sexual functions has been localized to a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 288 amino acids. Sequence analysis of sterile, heterokaryon-compatible mutants reveals frameshift mutations in this same ORF. The putative 288-amino acid product has a region of similarity to the MAT alpha 1 polypeptide of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\r"

This 3235-base-pair DNA segment is not homologous to the comparable genetic region of the A mating type. The unique a and A regions are bordered by nearly identical DNA sequences. The a genetic region contains at least two functional segments. One segment encodes a perithecium maturation function that is dependent on the second segment for phenotypic expression. This second a segment encodes a spliced mRNA that specifies the mt a-1 polypeptide. This polypeptide appears to be responsible for vegetative incompatibility, mating identity, and perithecium induction. The a-1 transcript is produced vegetatively and under conditions that induce sexual differentiation. The amino-terminal half of the mt a-1 polypeptide is homologous to the shorter Schizosaccharomyces pombe mat-Mc polypeptide. This homology and the properties of mt a-1 mutants suggest that the a-1 polypeptide segment that is homologous to the mat-Mc polypeptide may be primarily responsible for mating functions, while the distal segment is required for vegetative incompatibility.\r"

The level of enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase fused to a cytoplasmic membrane protein appears to reflect whether the fusion junction site normally faces the cytoplasm or periplasm. The alkaline phosphatase activities of cells expressing the lacY-phoA fusions distinguish between models previously proposed for the topology of lac permease and favor one with 12 transmembrane segments. This model is fully compatible with the results of earlier biochemical and immunological studies. The properties of fusions with junctions spanning two of the transmembrane segments at 2- or 3-amino acid intervals indicate that approximately half of the residues of either segment (9-11 amino acids) suffices to promote alkaline phosphatase translocation across the membrane. The additional transmembrane segment amino acids that are not required for this membrane insertion process may normally be needed in unfused lac permease after insertion for stable association with the membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Studies presented here on the fidelity of DNA synthesis in vitro support the hypothesis that a classical base-substitution intermediate (i.e., a misincorporated nucleotide) can yield a frameshift mutation. By using a fidelity assay specifically designed to detect minus-one-base errors, nucleotide substrate pool imbalances that have previously been shown to increase the rate of misincorporation are now shown to also increase minus-one-base frameshift error rates. Examination of the specificity of the errors produced in reactions with various dNTP pool imbalances and various DNA templates revealed that template nucleotides were preferentially lost when they had as a 5' neighbor a nucleotide complementary to the dNTP provided in excess. This suggests that when a misincorporated nucleotide is complementary to the next nucleotide in the template, a misaligned intermediate containing a correct terminal base pair can form and be extended by a DNA polymerase, leading to a frameshift mutation. We present evidence that the proposed mechanism may operate in vivo and discuss the implications of this model for frameshift mutations induced by DNA damage.\r"

As an initial step toward understanding this difference between the isozymes we have determined the DNA sequence of the heart enzyme and analyzed the amino acid sequence with special emphasis on the location of the phosphorylation site. We isolated and sequenced two overlapping cDNA fragments, which together could encode the complete amino acid sequence of bovine heart fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, a protein of 530 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 60,679. Since the deduced protein contained amino acid sequences identical to the sequences of four known tryptic peptides from this enzyme we concluded that the deduced protein sequence did represent bovine heart enzyme. In addition, a cDNA fragment hybridized to a 4-kilobase mRNA from bovine heart. The phosphorylation sites of the heart enzyme were located near the C terminus, whereas the phosphorylation site of the liver isozyme is known to be located near the N terminus. These opposite locations of the phosphorylation sites may explain the contrasting effect of the covalent modification on the enzymes' activities.\r"

  ".W": "Endoparasitic wasps of lepidopteran insects must induce changes in host immunity and development to survive. Depending on the species, this may require wasp venom proteins and/or a polydnavirus. We describe an immunological and genetic relationship between the Campoletis sonorensis polydnavirus and the wasp's venom gland. Monoclonal antibodies raised against venom glands recognized epitopes conserved on several polydnavirus proteins and on multiple wasp oviduct and venom proteins. The viral envelope proteins had molecular masses of 16, 20, 45, and 50 kDa, while a complex of at least five immunoreactive venom-gland and soluble oviduct proteins ranged in size from 24 to 36 kDa. Since the conserved epitopes were present on the viral envelope, neutralization assays were performed. Monoclonal antibodies added to purified virus blocked the normal viral inhibition of host growth and development. To determine whether venom mRNA and viral genes were also related, venom-related cDNA clones were isolated from the wasp oviduct with a venom-gland cDNA probe. Venom-related viral clones were then identified and selected from a viral genomic library and from a parasitized Heliothis virescens cDNA library. Venom-related mRNAs were expressed in the venom gland, the oviduct, and the parasitized host. We propose that the immunological relationship between venom and viral proteins, and the hybridization of venom and viral genes, may reflect an evolutionary relationship in which venom gene homologs were incorporated into the viral genome, thereby allowing viral expression of venom-related genes and enhancing parasite survival.\r"

By using a multiple primer set that generates DNA segments with overlapping cohesive termini, visna virus DNA can be amplified, retained, and detected in infected cells with sensitivities that exceed those of existing methods by more than 2 orders of magnitude. This advance in single-cell technology should prove useful in diagnosing and gaining insight into the pathogenesis of viral infections and provide new opportunities to look for viruses in chronic diseases of unknown etiology.\r"

The proteins encoded by the two genes are not subunits of the ATPase but rather appear to exercise an important function at a late stage in the synthesis of F1 after transport of the subunits into the internal compartment of mitochondria. Mitochondria of atp11 and atp12 mutants have only marginally reduced levels of the alpha and beta subunits of F1. Both proteins are processed to their mature size but are not part of a native F1 structure or associated with the mitochondrial membrane.

Upon binding class II major histocompatibility molecules, CD4 functions to enhance T-cell activation. By binding to CD4, HIV gains entry into the cell. We have used a chimeric molecule of CD4 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA-3), CD4PI, which lacks a membrane-spanning domain and is instead anchored in the membrane by linkage to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol. To further define the structural attributes of viral receptors, and specifically those of CD4 required for HIV infection, we have expressed CD4PI and CD4 in a human T-cell line, HSB-2. We find that CD4PI is able to mediate infection of these cells by HIV with similar, if not greater efficiency, compared with wild-type CD4. Thus the membrane-spanning region of CD4 is not required for HIV infection, and a lipid-anchored protein can serve as a viral receptor.\r"

Using this procedure, we detected CD4-TCR complexes on the surface of the transformed human leukemia T cells, HPB-ALL, in the absence of stimulation. More than one CD4 were found in association with one TCR. CD4-TCR complexes were not in rapid equilibrium with free CD4 and free TCR, and they were not induced by the dye-labeled anti-CD4 or anti-TCR.\r"

  ".W": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a putative polypeptide hormone, is a product of pancreatic beta-cells and the major constituent of the amyloid deposits seen mainly in islets of type 2 diabetic humans and diabetic cats. The connection between IAPP amyloid formation and diabetes is unknown, but a limited segment of the IAPP molecule, positions 20-29, seems responsible for the aggregation to fibrils. Differences in the amino acid sequence of this region probably determine whether or not islet amyloid can develop in a particular species. Amyloid fibril formation can be mimicked in vitro with the aid of synthetic peptides. With this technique we show that peptides corresponding to IAPP positions 20-29 of human and cat, species that develop IAPP-derived islet amyloid, form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The corresponding IAPP segment from three rodent species that do not develop IAPP-derived amyloid did not give rise to fibrils. Substitution of the human IAPP-(20-29) decapeptide with one or two amino acid residues from species without islet amyloid generally reduced the capacity to form fibrils. We conclude that the sequence Ala-Ile-Leu-Ser-Ser, corresponding to positions 25-29 of human IAPP, is strongly amyloidogenic and that a proline-for-serine substitution in position 28, as in several rodents, almost completely inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils.\r"

The filaments formed appear to retain the drug and are 12.8 nm in diameter with an 8.0-nm pitch. Two classes of drugs have been distinguished: (i) those that bind to RecA protein and induce assembly at low relative concentrations (e.g., ethidium bromide) and (ii) those that do not appear to interact directly with RecA protein and must be present at relatively high drug concentrations to stimulate assembly (e.g., m-AMSA). Ethidium bromide, acridine orange, and quinacrine inhibit RecA protein binding to single-stranded DNA. Addition of ATP to the drug-induced filaments causes the protein to rapidly dissociate from dsDNA, and protein binding to dsDNA diminishes upon extended exposure to room light. We suggest that the structure of the drug-induced filaments may be more typical of the complex that initiates RecA protein assembly along DNA rather than the product of extensive polymerization as induced by adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-glucoside (bgl) operon of Escherichia coli is subject to both positive control by transcriptional termination/antitermination and negative control by the beta-glucoside-specific transport protein, an integral membrane protein known as enzyme IIBgl. Previous results led us to speculate that enzyme IIBgl exerts its negative control by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating the antiterminator protein, BglG. Specifically, our model postulated that the transport protein enzyme IIBgl exhibits protein-phosphotransferase activity in the absence of beta-glucosides. We now present biochemical evidence that the phosphorylation of protein BglG does indeed occur in vivo and that it is accompanied by the loss of antitermination activity. BglG persists in the phosphorylated state in the absence of beta-glucosides but is rapidly dephosphorylated when beta-glucosides become available for transport. Our data also suggested specific interactions between the beta-glucoside transport protein and the glucose-specific enzyme III (enzyme IIIGlc), a component of glucose transport and a key element in regulation of catabolite repression. These observations indicate that enzyme IIIGlc may, in conjunction with enzyme IIBgl, modulate the transport of beta-glucosides and the phosphorylation of the antiterminator protein. In the absence of both sugars, when the catabolite-controlled promoter of the operon is derepressed, enzyme IIIGlc may mediate tight repression of antitermination.\r"

  ".W": "Regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression is dependent on specific regulatory regions in the long terminal repeat. These regions include the enhancer, SP1, \"TATA,\" and trans-activating (TAR) regions. In addition, viral regulatory proteins such as tat and rev are important in regulating HIV gene expression. The mechanism of tat activation remains the subject of investigation, but effects at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels seem likely. Previous mutagenesis of the tat protein revealed that the amino terminus, the cysteine-rich domain, and the basic domain were all required for complete tat activation. Mutants of other viral trans-acting regulatory proteins, including E1A, tax, and VM65, have been identified that were capable of antagonizing the activity of their corresponding wild-type proteins. We wished to determine whether mutants of the tat protein could be identified that exhibited a similar phenotype. One mutant (delta tat) that truncated the basic domain of tat resulted in a transdominant phenotype inhibiting tat-induced gene expression of the HIV long terminal repeat but not other viral promoters. This mutant exhibited its maximal phenotype in cotransfection experiments when present in an 8- to 30-fold molar excess over the wild-type tat gene. Trans-activation of the HIV long terminal repeat by delta tat was very defective at the DNA concentrations used in these experiments. RNase protection analysis indicated that this mutant decreased tat-induced steady-state mRNA levels of the HIV long terminal repeat. Second-site mutations of the delta tat gene in either the amino terminus or cysteine region eliminated the transdominant phenotype. In contrast to tat, which was localized predominantly to the nucleolus, delta tat was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that it may inhibit tat function by preventing nucleolar localization. Transdominant mutants of tat may have a role in potentially inhibiting HIV gene expression.\r"

Two nucleotides were removed from the 3' ends of both the U5 plus strand and the U3 minus strand; in both cases, cleavage was adjacent to a conserved CA dinucleotide. The reaction was metal-ion dependent, with a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. Reaction selectivity was further demonstrated by the lack of cleavage of an HIV U5 substrate on the complementary (minus) strand, an analogous substrate that mimics the U3 terminus of an avian retrovirus, and an HIV U5 substrate in which the conserved CA dinucleotide was replaced with a TA dinucleotide. Such an integration protein-mediated cleavage reaction is expected to occur as part of the integration event in the retroviral life cycle, in which a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral RNA genome is inserted into the host cell DNA.\r"

It has been postulated that the operation of this cell cycle control involves the gradual accumulation of rate-limiting mitotic inducers, which trigger nuclear division when their cellular concentration reaches a critical level. We have cloned a human gene, which we call CDC25, whose product may function as a mitotic inducer. This human gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 53,000 daltons whose C-terminal domain shares about 37% sequence identity with the fission yeast cdc25+ mitotic inducer. The human CDC25 gene rescues the defect of a fission yeast temperature-sensitive (ts) cdc25ts mutant that is unable to initiate mitosis. In HeLa cells CDC25 mRNA levels are very low in G1 and increase at least 4-fold as cells progress towards M phase. These data suggest that in human cells, as in fission yeast, the accumulation of CDC25 mitotic inducer during G2 may play a key role in regulating the timing of mitosis.\r"

The transgene was effectively and properly transcribed to form the mature mRNA in the transgenic mice. The production of rat renin and angiotensinogen in the transgenic mice carrying the corresponding transgene was also verified by immunoanalyses of these proteins. Furthermore, the specific angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was effective in reducing the elevated blood pressure of the hypertensive transgenic mice.

To explore the mechanism of its translation, we have fused the P gene of duck hepatitis B virus to the bacterial lacZ gene at a point 3' to the C-P overlap; this allows detection of the products of P translation with antisera to the lacZ-encoded protein. The C and P/Z coding regions were cloned downstream of a heterologous promoter and expressed in COS-7 cells. A single, bicistronic mRNA containing both C and P sequences is detected in these cells, and translational initiation occurs efficiently at the internally situated P AUG. Mutations affecting C translation have only minimal effects on P expression, in contrast to what would be expected from a modified scanning model for translation. We conclude that P translation depends on a mechanism other than scanning to allow internal entry of ribosomes to the region of the P initiator.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that urine of febrile patients contains a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibiting activity (TNF-alpha Inh) when tested in a cytotoxicity assay using the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-susceptible cell line L929. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the TNF-alpha Inh and a potential soluble form of the receptor, as the former has been shown to block TNF-alpha activities by binding to the ligand. We demonstrate that human TNF-alpha is affected to a greater extent than is murine TNF-alpha. This species specificity of the inhibitor correlates with the binding studies of TNF receptor interactions already reported. We raised a polyclonal antibody to TNF-alpha Inh that neutralizes its activity and does not recognize TNF-alpha. Solubilized cross-linked 125I-labeled TNF-alpha receptor complex could be immunoprecipitated by using either anti-TNF-alpha or anti-TNF-alpha Inh antibody, suggesting immunological cross-reactivity between the receptor and the inhibitor. By using fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled TNF-alpha, it was possible to visualize by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis the TNF-alpha receptor on phytohemagglutinin/interleukin 2-activated T cells. A similar increase of immunofluorescence intensity of the activated T cells was observed by using anti-TNF-alpha Inh antibody revealed with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG1 conjugate, suggesting that the TNF-alpha Inh is also expressed as a membrane protein. Taken together, our results suggest that the TNF-alpha Inh originally described might be a soluble form of the TNF receptor itself.\r"

In this randomized, double-blind study on 76 breast-augmented women, 50 percent of the patients had preoperative prophylaxis with benzylpenicillin and dicloxacillin. Bacteria samples were taken intraoperatively. The number of negative cultures increased significantly with antibiotic prophylaxis. In four follow-ups during the first postoperative year, the rate of contractures was evaluated by subjective and objective methods. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the placebo and the antibiotic group with respect to the incidence of capsular contracture.\r"

  ".U": "90311447\r", 
  ".W": "An island skin flap was designed on the left inferior epigastric neurovascular bundle of anesthetized male rats. Blood flow was measured in situ with a laser Doppler flowmeter at 20 discrete points on a grid system (5 points in each quadrant of the flap) before and after surgery, or before vascular occlusion, during reperfusion, and 48 to 72 hours later. Two series of experiments were performed. In the first series, the raised flap was placed in a bath containing heated Ringer's solution and the left pedicle was cross-clamped. After 30 minutes, adenosine at a concentration that produced supramaximal vasodilatation, or its vehicle, was added to the bath. After 1 hour total occlusion time, the vascular clamp was released and adenosine treatment was continued for the first 30 minutes of reperfusion. In the second series, the protocol was similar except that adenosine, or its vehicle, was infused into the ischemic flap by means of the distal stump of the right inferior epigastric artery. After 48 to 72 hours, fluorescein was injected IV. The data showed a significant regional variation in baseline laser Doppler blood flow that was further altered by surgically raising the flap. Whereas proximal axial laser Doppler blood flow was essentially unchanged from the preoperative baseline, distal axial laser Doppler blood flow decreased 10 to 50 percent, and proximal and distal dependent laser Doppler blood flow decreased 50 to 80 percent. Thus no single value accurately reflected total flap perfusion. Necrosis occurred only in the dependent flap regions, which confirmed previous work. In the dependent regions, especially along the incision line, postoperative laser Doppler blood flow was lowest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90311458\r", 
  ".W": "I have used polyurethane prostheses for the past 14 years, implanting 220 implants into 130 patients who desired breast reconstruction after subcutaneous mastectomy or cancer ablation or simply breast augmentation. I theorize that a polyurethane-covered implant resists contracture, retaining its compressibility because the fibroblasts proliferate into the polyurethane in many different directions. When the fibrils contract, the forces of contracture counterbalance one another, resisting contracture. However, when smooth prostheses are implanted, fibrils are directed in a circular fashion around the implant and naturally contract, leading to firmer breasts. There were 115 prostheses inserted following subcutaneous mastectomy, and 22 percent developed contracted capsules. Seven implants became exposed because of skin necroses; one was removed because of a Staphylococcus infection; and two patients developed a combination of polyurethane and silicone granulomas. These developed only with the earlier implant, where there was shedding of the polyurethane sponge layer and silicone bled from the low-viscosity silicone used in the earlier implants. No granulomas were noted with the currently used Surgitek Replicon implant. Eighty-five breasts were reconstructed after cancer ablation with polyurethane implants, and the contracture rate was 2.3 percent. Other complications were minimal. A smaller group of patients had augmentation mammaplasty, and 20 prostheses were placed in 10 patients. A 15 percent contracture rate was noted in this group. In this study, 82 percent of patients were followed for up to 14 years. Capsular contractures occurred in 30 implants between 1 and 11 years, for an average recurrence at 6.3 years. The overall contracture rate was 13 percent. Other complications were minimal. All implants were placed subcutaneously or subglandularly, and all were drained.\r"

All tumors showed either a hypoechoic or isoechoic echo pattern. However, 11 patients demonstrated evidence of focal bright echogenic areas at the periphery or within the center of a hypoechoic tumor. Coarse echogenic foci seen in seven patients corresponded pathologically to calcified corpora amylacea in benign tumors of the prostate gland either at the edge of the tumor or scattered throughout the tumor. Seven patients showed a fine, stippled echogenic pattern within the lesion. On a pathologic level, this pattern represented high-grade tumors with extensive central comedonecrosis and calcifications in five patients and an unusual deposit of small intraluminal crystalloid deposits in two patients. Combinations of echo patterns were observed in three patients. This study demonstrates that echogenic foci can be seen within predominantly hypoechoic tumor nodules. Coarse bright echoes, usually at the periphery of the tumor, suggest calcifications in benign prostate glands. Tumor calcifications and intraluminal prostatic crystalloid deposits were located more centrally and had a finer stippled sonographic appearance.\r"

Carcinoma was diagnosed at biopsy of only the nodule in 56 of these patients (79%), at both the nodule and random biopsy site in 10 (14%), and only at the random biopsy site in five (7%). Random biopsy did not result in significant alteration of clinical staging. However, management was altered in five patients with positive results at random biopsy only, four of whom underwent surgery. The additional yield from random prostatic biopsy was small but distinct and had clinical relevance. The authors conclude that random biopsy is a useful procedure in the evaluation of patients with prostatic nodules.\r"

Eighteen patients were treated for nonoperable conditions. Diagnoses made with color Doppler US correlated with final clinical diagnoses in all patients. In 10 of 27 patients (38%), the diagnosis was established at color Doppler US. Until now, nuclear scanning has had a paramount role in the evaluation of equivocal cases of acute scrotal disease.

Nine pseudogestational sacs were evaluated, of which seven demonstrated no flow and two demonstrated minimal flow that averaged 0.4/0.1 kHz. Defining intrauterine peritrophoblastic flow as a peak systolic frequency shift of 0.8 kHz or greater (equivalent to 21 cm/sec with an angle of 0 degree) correctly classifies 26 of the 31 intrauterine pregnancies and all of the nine pseudosacs.

Times of peak renal activity (Tmax) were determined from renal time-activity curves, and glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were calculated with the Gates technique.

When evaluated separately, the most useful sequences in the detection of these microadenomas were coronal pregadolinium T1-weighted SE, coronal pregadolinium 3D FLASH, coronal postgadolinium T1-weighted SE, and coronal postgadolinium 3D FLASH. The combination of pre- and postgadolinium T1-weighted sequences with pre-and postgadolinium 3D FLASH sequences produced the highest number of true-positive findings (90%) and the lowest number of false-positive findings (5%). When a 1.5-T imaging unit with a high signal-to-noise ratio allowing useful three-dimensional acquisition is used, the authors advocate a coronal T1-weighted SE sequence, followed (if necessary) by a coronal 3D FLASH sequence, both without injection of gadolinium, in the diagnosis of pituitary microadenomas. When no confident diagnosis is reached, the same sequences should be performed after the injection of gadolinium. The sagittal pre- and postgadolinium T1-weighted SE and long-TR SE sequences are useful only in specific cases.\r"

The use of the contrast agent changed the diagnosis that was based on the unenhanced images in nine head studies and 13 spine studies.

Thirty-one of these 35 patients had acute appendicitis documented by surgical and pathologic findings. The remaining four patients were observed, and their symptoms resolved. Thirty-five patients had US scans considered negative for appendicitis. Seventeen of these patients had US findings positive for other conditions including mesenteric adenitis, ileitis, intussusception, Crohn disease, and Burkitt lymphoma. In this series US enabled diagnosis of acute appendicitis with a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 89%, and a predictive accuracy of 91%. Diagnosis of acute appendicitis can be made with US with the same accuracy in children as has been previously reported in series of adult patients. The use of US in clinically ambiguous cases may allow earlier diagnosis, prevention of perforation, and decreased complications in the pediatric patient with acute appendicitis.\r"

With this device it is possible to obtain high-resolution images of vessel structure in real time. This may provide valuable information about the degree of stenosis, as well as the type and extent of atherosclerotic plaque, in relation to the underlying tunica media and adventitia. The intravascular US catheter was used in seven patients undergoing transfemoral angiography because of arteriosclerosis obliterans. High-resolution images were obtained in all seven patients, and no complications were noted. Various US findings were demonstrated and correlated with the angiographic findings.\r"

One hundred twenty-one patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Same-day studies were performed, with air used for insufflation, in group 1; same-day studies, with carbon dioxide, in group 2; and separate-day studies in group 3. Scout images obtained before the ACBE study were graded for the amount of air seen, and ACBE studies were graded for overall quality; each was graded on a scale of 0-3 in a blinded fashion. The air score was significantly greater in group 1 (2.69) than in group 2 (2.01) (P less than .001), which in turn was significantly greater than in group 3 (1.53) (P less than .01). The ACBE quality scores in the three groups were not significantly different. The authors conclude that FPS can be done before ACBE examination without impairing the quality of the ACBE study. Although carbon dioxide insufflation results in less intestinal air after FPS, the quality of the ACBE study is not affected.\r"

Using a radiolucent halo that remained affixed to the cranium with skin-piercing screws, the authors treated 24 patients with a multifraction technique for benign and malignant brain lesions. The objective of this study was to ascertain the feasibility of maintaining the halo in place for a prolonged, multifraction course of treatment, not to assess treatment efficacy. The halo was affixed for multifraction treatments lasting 19-58 days (mean, 38.7 days; median, 40.0 days) and delivered in 16-31 fractions (mean, 24.9 fractions; median, 25.5 fractions). Two of 24 patients experienced superficial skin infection at the site of fixation, but no other significant acute or chronic toxicity attributable to the stereotactic halo was observed. The authors conclude that stereotactic, small-field, precision irradiation can be accomplished with multiple fractions as well as with a single fraction.\r"

ERK1 has striking similarity to two protein kinases, KSS1 and FUS3, from yeast. The yeast kinases function in an antagonistic manner to regulate the cell cycle in response to mating factors. Thus, ERK1 and the two yeast kinases constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes involved in regulating the response of eukaryotic cells to extracellular signals.\r"

Double-strand cleavage products of the correct size and location were observed, indicating that the oligonucleotide bound and cleaved the target site among almost 14 megabase pairs of DNA. Because oligonucleotide-directed triple-helix formation has the potential to be a general solution for DNA recognition, this result has implications for physical mapping of chromosomes.\r"

Clinical data suggest that nimodipine has a beneficial effect on the neurologic outcome of patients suffering an acute ischemic stroke. Our double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial was designed to assess the effects of oral nimodipine on the mortality rate and neurologic outcome of patients with an acute ischemic stroke. One hundred sixty-four patients were randomly allocated to receive either nimodipine tablets (30 mg q.i.d.) or identical placebo tablets for 28 days. Treatment was always started less than or equal to 48 hours after the acute event. The Mathew Scale, slightly modified by Gelmers et al, was used for neurologic assessment. Mortality rate and neurologic outcome after 28 days were used as evaluation criteria. We considered 123 patients to be valid for the analysis of efficacy. Mortality rates did not differ significantly between groups. Neurologic outcome after 28 days of therapy did not differ between groups. However, when only those patients most likely to benefit from any intervention (Mathew Scale sum score of less than or equal to 65 at baseline) were analyzed separately in post hoc-defined subgroups, the nimodipine-treated subgroups showed a significantly better neurologic outcome. This result suggests that some patients with acute ischemic stroke will benefit from treatment with nimodipine tablets.\r"

Yet, published data show that the evidence is not so straightforward or easy to evaluate. The majority of the hard evidence, however, does imply that stroke patients benefit from rehabilitation with physiotherapy. This benefit may be statistically small, but for a given individual, it could mean the difference between living at home or in an institution. Few studies address the question of the optimal physiotherapy in stroke rehabilitation. The evidence available today suggests that it does not matter which form of treatment is chosen and that any of the available approaches will improve the patient's functional status. In other words, if an optimal treatment exists, we have, so far, failed to identify it. Until further evidence emerges, we should therefore select therapies that are most cost-effective and that can be given to the largest number of patients. Well-planned clinical trials aimed at finding the best approach and discriminating potential responders from nonresponders are urgently needed.\r"

These symptoms can be management problems for both the physician and the caregiver. In many cases, however, pharmacologic intervention is helpful. Even in dementia, depressive symptoms usually respond to antidepressant therapy. Neuroleptic medications are the drugs most commonly used to manage behavioral symptoms, such as agitation, suspiciousness, emotional lability, hostility and sleeplessness. A few studies have shown that ergoloid mesylates (Hydergine) can modestly improve cognitive function. Some experimental drugs also show promise in partially reversing the symptoms of intellectual decline.\r"

Bowen's disease requires excision, cryosurgery, electrodesiccation with curettage, or chemosurgery; close follow-up examination is necessary, regardless of the type of treatment.

APSI was planned because patients with a death rate greater than 20% have not been enrolled in significant numbers in previous trials and in such high-risk patients, it remained to be proven that beta blockers have a beneficial effect. Patients with an expected average risk of greater than 20% were to be selected based on clinical criteria. At the time of the second interim analysis, the placebo group 1-year mortality was much lower than expected (12%). The ethical board recommended to stop the trial: 309 patients had been allocated to placebo, 298 to acebutolol. The average delay between onset of symptoms and inclusion was 10.5 days. The average follow-up was 318 days after inclusion. About the same number of patients were discontinued from study treatment in both groups. All patients were included in the analysis. There were 17 deaths in the acebutolol group and 34 in the placebo group, a 48% decrease (p = 0.019). The vascular mortality decreased by 58% (p = 0.006), the highest ever observed with a beta blocker. All cardiovascular causes of death, including congestive heart failure, were less frequent in the acebutolol group. Although the objective was not achieved, APSI patients were at a higher risk than the average of the 9 previous trials with beta blockers (12% instead of 7%). In addition, the total mortality reduction did not decrease in 9 subgroups with increasing mortality risk from 2 to 23%. APSI shows that moderately severe postAMI patients can benefit from a beta-blocking treatment and a beta-blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can be effective.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it was shown that aspirin given early in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) improves hospital survival, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. In a prospective, randomized placebo-controlled trial, the influence of early intervention with low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) on infarct size and clinical outcome was studied in 100 consecutive patients with first anterior wall AMI. Infarct size was calculated by cumulative lactate dehydrogenase release in the first 72 hours after admission and was found to be (mean +/- standard deviation) 1,431 +/- 782 U/liter in the aspirin group (n = 50) and 1,592 +/- 1,082 U/liter in the placebo group (n = 50, p = 0.35). The study medication was given for 3 months, during which mortality was 10 (20%) in the aspirin patients and 12 (24%) in the placebo patients (p = 0.65). However, reinfarction occurred in 2 patients (4%) in the aspirin group and in 9 (18%) in the placebo group (p less than 0.03). Early intervention with low-dose aspirin showed, in comparison to placebo, a 10% decrease of infarct size, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, early low-dose aspirin effectively decreased the risk of reinfarction. Therefore, the favor able results of early aspirin on mortality in acute myocardial infarction are probably due more to prevention of reinfarction than to decrease of infarct size.\r"

After their angina pectoris was stabilized in phase 1, the patients were randomly assigned to sequence group A or B. Group A received a placebo 3 times daily in phase 2 and then 50 mg of dipyridamole 3 times daily in phase 3. Group B received the treatment in the reverse order. The degree of ST depression and the threshold for angina pectoris in treadmill exercise electrocardiography, which was performed on the last days of phases 2 and 3, were compared. The mean duration of exercise was 5 minutes and 23 seconds during dipyridamole and 5 minutes and 13 seconds during placebo administration, with no significant difference. Dipyridamole caused an aggravating effect on the ST change (earlier appearance of ST depression and/or deeper total sum of ST depression at the end of the exercise) in 3 patients, a salutary effect in 5 and no effect in 10. Dipyridamole decreased the threshold for angina pectoris in 5 patients, increased it in 6 and did not change it in 7. To summarize, dipyridamole showed adverse effects (aggravative effects on the ST change and/or on the threshold for angina pectoris) in 6 patients, beneficial effects in 8 and no effect in 4. A usual oral dose of dipyridamole induced myocardial ischemia during exercise in some patients while it improved it in a similar number of patients.\r"

Severe anginal pain occurred less frequently in patients receiving Fluosol perfusion (21%) than in those receiving routine angioplasty (34%) (p less than 0.05). ST-segment changes at balloon deflation in routine angioplasty patients were significantly greater than in patients who received oxygenated Fluosol perfusion (2.2 +/- 1.2 vs 1.7 +/- 0.9 mm; p less than 0.03). Profound regional wall dysfunction (-561 +/- 224 U) was observed in routine angioplasty patients by 2-dimensional echocardiography. Patients receiving oxygenated Fluosol perfusion, however, maintained near baseline levels of ventricular function (-61 +/- 335 U) during occlusion (p less than 0.0001). Mean global left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved at baseline levels during balloon inflation in patients perfused with oxygenated Fluosol but decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) during occlusion in routine angioplasty patients. A total of 26 complications (19 routine group; 7 perfusion group) was reported. Adverse responses to the perfusate were infrequent, occurring in 1.6 and 2.0% of patients after the test dose and during perfusion, respectively. Thus, transcatheter perfusion with an oxygen-carrying perfluorochemical emulsion is effective in alleviating myocardial ischemia during angioplasty and can be safely administered in this patient population.\r"

  ".U": "90313678\r", 
  ".W": "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are specific for constituents of neutrophil primary granules and monocyte lysosomes. There are different types of ANCA with different specificities. By indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using alcohol-fixed neutrophils as substrate, two major categories of ANCA can be recognized, one with cytoplasmic staining (C-ANCA) and the other with artifactual perinuclear staining (P-ANCA). Some C-ANCA have specificity for proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA) and some P-ANCA have specificity for myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA), but there are additional C-ANCA and P-ANCA specificities. ANCA are found in the blood of patients with necrotizing systemic vasculitis, such as Wegener's granulomatosis and polyarteritis nodosa, and patients with idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis. The glomerular lesion in patients with systemic and renal-limited ANCA-associated diseases is the same, ie, a pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. No matter where the vascular lesions of ANCA-associated disease are (eg, kidney, lung, gut, muscle, skin), they are characterized by necrotizing inflammation and a paucity of immune deposits. The distribution of disease correlates to a degree with the ANCA specificity, although there is substantial overlap. For example, patients with Wegener's granulomatosis most often have C-ANCA and patients with renal-limited disease most often have P-ANCA. In patients with P-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, approximately 90% of the P-ANCA have specificity for MPO. The clinical manifestations of ANCA-associated diseases often begin following a flu-like illness. The onset is most often in the winter and least often in the summer. The renal disease usually presents as rapidly progressive renal failure with nephritis. One of the most life-threatening components of the systemic involvement is pulmonary hemorrhage caused by a necrotizing alveolar capillaritis. Intravenous cyclophosphamide plus steroids is as effective as oral cyclophosphamide plus steroids for controlling ANCA-associated diseases. Using life-table analysis, the 2-year patient and renal survival rate in both patients with renal-limited and systemic disease is greater than 70%. There is evidence that in addition to being a useful serologic marker, ANCA are directly involved in the pathogenesis of the vascular injury in patients with ANCA-associated diseases. Although ANCA antigens are normally in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and monocytes, priming of these cells, as occurs following exposure to certain cytokines, results in the release of small amounts of ANCA antigens at the cell surface. In vitro, ANCA-IgG causes cytokine-primed neutrophils to undergo a respiratory burst and degranulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We measured serum creatinine, DPTA, and creatinine clearances, and urinary albumin excretion. The clinical course of 24 patients (83%) permitted repeat studies over a period of 32 +/- 1 (SEM) months, and in these patients DTPA clearance, creatinine clearance, and the serum creatinine concentration did not vary with time. Five of the patients (17%) lost their grafts and returned to dialysis. On initial evaluation patients who lost their grafts had a lower DPTA clearance than those whose function was maintained (29 +/- 3 v 46 +/- 2 mL/min/1.73 m2 body surface area [BSA], respectively, P less than 0.005) and all of them had a DTPA clearance of less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 BSA. There was an inverse correlation between the log of the urinary albumin excretion and the DTPA clearance (n = 33, r = -0.59, P less than 0.001), a direct correlation with the serum creatinine concentration (N = 33, r = 0.89, P less than 0.0001), but no correlation with time after transplantation. Thus, despite the continued use of CsA, renal function over time was stable in patients who underwent repeated studies, as was the relationship between the DTPA clearance and the clinically used markers of transplant function, the serum creatinine concentration, and the creatinine clearance.\r"

The overall patient survival and patient survival with a functioning first renal allograft were similar in both groups. Infection and cardiovascular accidents were the leading causes of early and late death in both groups. No cause of death was greatly overrepresented in the ADPKD group. Serious complications from extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD following renal transplantation included a ruptured intracranial aneurysm in one patient, a dissection of the ascending thoracic aorta in one patient, and infected hepatic cysts in two patients. Neoplasia (other than skin or cervical) occurred in four ADPKD patients and in one control patient and included one lymphoma in each group. Two ADPKD and one control patient had monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. No complications related to the retention of native kidneys were detected in 12 ADPKD patients with a mean follow-up of 3 years. Cysts were observed in the renal allografts of some patients in both groups at autopsy and in a prospective computed tomography (CT) study of the allograft. However, we failed to detect a significant difference in the occurrence and number of the cysts between ADPKD and control patients.\r"

We scanned 49 consecutive patients with a total of 65 biopsies; 46 biopsies in 33 consecutive patients were included in our study. In our population, the prevalence of acute rejection was 61% (28/46). Using a resistive index (RI) cutoff of greater than 0.90 based on the main renal artery flow pattern, the sensitivity of our test was 43%, with a 67% specificity. The positive predictive value was 67%. Our results are contrasted and compared with the published data from other groups in a critical survey of the literature. We conclude that duplex Doppler sonography alone is inadequate to evaluate acute rejection in renal transplants.\r"

However, immunofluorescent staining with an anti-beta 2-microglobulin monoclonal antibody was positive in the skin of all patients and of six of the eight controls. Beta 2M skin deposition is more intense in patients than in controls and increases with patient age and the duration of dialysis. A stron correlation is observed between the extent of skin beta 2M deposits and clinical manifestations due to beta 2M deposits in internal organs. However, no correlation is found between beta 2M skin deposits and sex or beta 2M serum levels.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II has been implicated in mediating renal vasoconstriction resulting from chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in both mature and developing animals. We have previously shown that chronic neonatal UUO results in increased distribution of renin and its mRNA in the obstructed kidney, as well as of immunoreactive renin in the intact opposite kidney. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of 24 hours versus 4 weeks of UUO on the distribution of renin mRNA and its protein in the adult rat kidney. Renin was detected by immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal anti-rat renin antibody. Renin mRNA was localized by in situ hybridization to an oligonucleotide complementary to renin mRNA. UUO of 24 hours' or 4 weeks' duration did not alter the distribution of renin and its mRNA in the obstructed kidneys as compared with sham-operated kidneys, although kidneys obstructed for 4 weeks had a significant increase in the percent of renin-containing juxtaglomerular apparatuses (JCA) when compared with the intact opposite kidneys (P less than 0.05). Compensatory hypertrophy was not present in the intact opposite kidneys after 24 hours of UUO and distribution of renin gene expression was not altered at that time. However, 4 weeks following contralateral UUO, the intact kidneys were hypertrophied and showed a decrease in renin gene expression relative to the obstructed and sham-operated kidneys. We conclude that unlike UUO during early development, chronic UUO in the mature animal does not activate renin gene expression nor alter renin distribution in the obstructed kidneys. Renin gene expression is suppressed in the hypertrophied kidney with prolonged contralateral UUO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Initial autopsy studies concerned primarily with the systemic manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) did not indicate that significant renal problems were likely to occur in AIDS patients. However, several recent studies have suggested that important renal and electrolyte disorders develop frequently in at least some groups of AIDS patients. In this report, we review current information concerning such disorders and describe our study of the frequency and types of renal lesions in the first 50 AIDS patients undergoing autopsy at this institution. We conclude that a number of renal lesions and electrolyte abnormalities occur in AIDS patients, although the frequency and nature of these problems vary considerably from center to center. Studies from several centers, including our own, indicate that AIDS patients are particularly likely to develop tubulointerstitial lesions (such as nephrocalcinosis and interstitial nephritis) and electrolyte disorders. Additional studies from specific centers in New York City, Miami, Detroit, and Los Angeles indicate that AIDS patients can also develop glomerular lesions, including a variant of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) associated with heavy proteinuria and rapidly progressive renal failure. Although FSGS is not commonly observed in all centers, AIDS patients with this lesion appear to have a distinctive combination of clinical and pathological features, suggesting that they have a specific \"human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated\" nephropathy. Preliminary evidence suggests that this lesion may be related to direct renal HIV infection, although confirmation of this possibility is needed. The approach to the AIDS patient with renal disease should involve correction of reversible disorders and consideration of dialysis as necessary.\r"

Male HD patients (diabetic and nondiabetic) did not differ significantly from the NHANES II data. Diabetic HD females did not differ significantly from the NHANES II data, except for the TSF of black women older than 55 years. Measurements of nondiabetic HD females (black and white) were significantly below the NHANES II data. In 138 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, measurements were similar to those of HD patients.\r"

The clinical course was more severe in males, which corresponded to higher rate of GBM alterations.

There was a positive correlation of the split lesions and age in males, but not in females. The degree of splitting was directly proportional to the grade of proteinuria, while GBM thinning did not significantly correlate with proteinuria.\r"

  ".W": "In 1989, it is estimated that coronary angioplasty will be performed in more than 250,000 patients for the relief of ischemic symptoms due to coronary artery disease. Despite its widespread acceptance, the overall success of coronary angioplasty has been limited by the development of recurrent ischemia due to restenosis in approximately 30% of patients undergoing this procedure. Restenosis, due to an excessive fibroproliferative response to endothelial denudation and vessel injury that occurs at the time of vessel dilatation, usually develops within six months after coronary angioplasty. Although a variety of clinical, anatomic, and procedural factors may identify patients at risk for the development of restenosis, intensive pharmacologic and, recently, mechanical interventions have generally been ineffective in its prevention. New therapies, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, receptor blockade of specific vasoactive mediators, and growth factor modification, appear to be promising methods for the future in the prevention of restenosis. Moreover, further refinement of the use of mechanical techniques such as excisional atherectomy, laser, and endoluminal stents may diminish the degree of vascular damage that occurs at the time of vessel dilatation, and attenuate the biologic processes that ultimately culminate in restenosis.\r"

The use of an antitachycardia pacemaker in combination with the AICD has also provided an effective therapy for patients with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia that is refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs. The risk of sudden cardiac death following implantation of an AICD in patients with malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is lower than has been observed during treatment with amiodarone, direct operations for ventricular tachycardia, or conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy guided by either noninvasive or invasive electrophysiologic testing. Although the impact of this device on the subsequent risk of sudden death is widely recognized, the effect on overall mortality is more controversial. Careful preoperative evaluation, electrophysiologic testing, and patient selection are critical for the successful use of antitachycardia devices. Clinical trials of AICDs with the capability for antitachycardia and bradycardia pacing, programmable pulse energy and waveform, and extensive memory will soon begin in the United States. Despite considerable limitations in the currently available technology, future developments in implantable antitachycardia devices offer the greatest promise for improving the outcome of patients at risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects approximately 400,000 new patients each year in the United States, resulting in death in more than 50% within five years, with traditional therapy including digitalis and diuretics. The aging of the population will only serve to aggravate this problem. Surgical treatment of CHF is a viable option in a minority of cases; a total of no more than 2,000 heart transplantation procedures were performed in the United States in 1988. Therefore, if survival is to improve in patients with CHF, effective alternative medical therapy may need to be added to or substituted for more traditional therapy. Vasodilator therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and enalapril, or the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, improves survival in patients with severe heart failure when added to treatment with digitalis and diuretics. Nevertheless, the mortality rate remains extremely high once this stage of the disease process is reached. The prevention of left ventricular dilatation and remodeling, before the occurrence of overt heart failure, is the focus of much attention. Interventions that limit or interrupt the disease process at an even earlier stage will be necessary to make a major impact on survival.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Our purpose was to determine which clinical features predict short-term mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter study of 347 patients hospitalized in Pittsburgh (the derivation cohort) and 253 hospitalized and ambulatory patients in Boston (the validation cohort) with clinical and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Patients in the derivation cohort underwent an extensive microbiologic evaluation including bacteriologic sputum culture, blood cultures, direct fluorescent antibody testing for Legionella species, and serologic testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella species, and Chlamydia TWAR. RESULTS: The overall mortality was 18% in the derivation cohort and 13.2% in the validation cohort. We identified five independent predictors of mortality in the derivation cohort: pleuritic chest pain (risk ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.99), mental status changes (risk ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.6), a severe vital sign abnormality (risk ratio, 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.6), neoplastic disease (risk ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.7 to 9.1), and \"high-risk\" pneumonia etiology (risk ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.0). A mortality index based on these factors accurately classified patients into five risk classes of increasing mortality. In the derivation cohort, the 6-week mortality rates were 0% in class I, 2.9% in class II, 13.1% in class III, 32.7% in class IV, and 89.5% in class V. There was little deterioration in the predictive accuracy of the model when tested in the validation cohort: mortality was 2.2% in class I, 0% in class II, 13.5% in class III, 33.3% in class IV, and 55.6% in class V. CONCLUSIONS: This prognostic classification may help direct triage decisions, assess appropriateness of care, and guide the design and analysis of therapeutic trials in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the risk of an adverse outcome in initially uncomplicated, \"rule-out myocardial infarction\" patients who were admitted directly to a stepdown unit (n = 58) or to a coronary care unit (n = 409) at 6 hospitals and who then ultimately \"ruled in\" for a myocardial infarction. RESULTS: An adverse outcome (death, serious complication, or invasive intervention) occurred in 16 (28%) stepdown unit patients compared with 159 (39%) coronary care unit patients. Among patients eligible for initial care in either location, the risk of an adverse outcome after controlling for clinical characteristics was similar in the two groups using each of two different multivariate approaches. CONCLUSION: Although our study was not of sufficient size to exclude the possibility of a small benefit from initial triage to a coronary care unit, our data suggest that (1) admission of initially uncomplicated chest pain patients with a relatively low probability of acute myocardial infarction to a stepdown unit does not seriously jeopardize those who eventually \"rule in\" for myocardial infarction; and (2) larger observational or randomized studies, which could reduce the residual possibility of somewhat higher risk in the stepdown unit, would be ethical to perform.\r"

To test the clinical validity of this suggestion, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing a conventional multiple-daily-dosing regimen of netilmicin with once-daily administration of the same total daily dose of this aminoglycoside. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 141 predominantly elderly patients with severe bacterial infections. All patients received once-daily doses of 2 g ceftriaxone, in addition to netilmicin. RESULTS: Patients randomized to either of the two dosing strategies were comparable regarding age, APACHE II score, concomitant diseases, infection site, and rate of culture-proven bacteremia. Netilmicin treatment did not differ significantly in mean daily dose per kg body weight and days of therapy between the two treatment arms. Compared to patients receiving conventional doses, patients treated with a once-daily dose had higher serum peak netilmicin levels and lower trough levels. Outcome of infection and mortality were not influenced by dosing strategy. Although the overall incidence of nephrotoxicity was similar in both groups (16%), the occurrence of nephrotoxicity in patients treated with once-daily doses of netilmicin was significantly shifted to those given prolonged treatment, i.e., beyond 9 days. Auditory toxicity was documented in one patient treated with conventional doses and two patients treated with once-daily doses. CONCLUSION: Once-daily dosing of an aminoglycoside plus a long-acting cephalosporin in these patients constituted cost-effective and safe treatment for severe bacterial infections. Netilmicin-induced toxicity may be reduced by using once-daily dosing regimens and limiting the duration of treatment.\r"

Cataract extraction and pressure-lowering operations were required in both eyes because of a tumor-induced angle-closure glaucoma. Vision, however, progressively decreased to light perception in each eye. Both eyes were finally enucleated because a malignant melanoma could not be ruled out, though iris tissue obtained in 1985 suggested a nevuslike process. Histologic study indicated a bilateral uveal hyperplasia. Results of light and electron microscopy, immunologic studies, and suspension cell culture suggested that the uveal hyperplasia was more likely a melanoma of low malignancy than a nevuslike process. We could not detect an extraocular primary tumor and assumed that this condition constituted an oncogenic syndrome.\r"

However, sclerotherapy will fail and surgical rescue will be required in at least a third of patients. There are two viable surgical rescue procedures: shunt surgery and liver transplantation. This paper summarizes the available data and concludes that there is a role for both procedures.\r"

Inferior venacavography and percutaneous liver biopsy can be performed safely in these patients, and both procedures provide useful information for the selection of appropriate surgical therapy. Most cases of the Budd-Chiari syndrome are amenable to mesocaval or mesoatrial shunting.

Clinical studies show that gastrointestinal bleeding can be prevented by pharmacologic therapy. This type of treatment is efficient and safe, and, if a drug has no clinical effect, a different drug or a combination can be used. Several problems, however, need to be addressed, including patient compliance, selection of responders, and hemodynamic evaluation of the treatment and its duration. Although pharmacologic treatment of portal hypertension is known to be efficient, there are advances still to be made.\r"

Based on a review of prospective randomized trials, control of acute variceal bleeding should involve vasopressin plus nitroglycerin as indicated for minor bleeding episodes, sclerotherapy for more severe bleeding episodes, and staple transection of the esophagus for patients who do not respond to these initial measures. Emergency portasystemic shunt surgery cannot be recommended at this time. For prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage, the data support the use of nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol or nadolol) for patients with good liver function (Child's class A and B) and the use of chronic sclerotherapy to obliterate esophageal varices for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child's class C). Surgical procedures should be reserved for failures of medical management. The use of beta-adrenergic blockers offers the most promise for prevention of initial variceal bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The enthusiasm for injection sclerotherapy over the last decade has almost certainly surpassed what was justified on the basis of objective evidence. This was most clearly emphasized by the widespread adoption of prophylactic sclerotherapy after the report of the first two trials, even though enough was known of the natural history of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis to warrant caution. The use of sclerotherapy for an episode of variceal hemorrhage represents the role most supported by the available data. Diagnostic endoscopy, as an integral part of management, provides the optimum time to intervene with sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy can then provide hemostasis in patients who are actively bleeding and prevent early rebleeding in those in whom bleeding has stopped spontaneously. The progression to long-term injection sclerotherapy is of proven benefit; however, doubts exist concerning the need for the intensive regimens currently in use. The continued use of long-term injection sclerotherapy is dependent not only on additional investigations, but also on the accumulating evidence arising from comparative studies encompassing other available therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sclerotherapy is currently the primary treatment of choice for the majority of patients who present with esophageal variceal bleeding. Although it has altered the management of these patients, unanswered questions and controversies remain. Patients with acute variceal bleeding should preferably be treated in a specialized center. The primary treatment should be immediate sclerotherapy, when possible. Portosystemic shunts and esophageal transection should be reserved for the 5% to 10% of patients in whom sclerotherapy fails to control acute bleeding. There are several treatment options for long-term management after a variceal bleeding episode. Sclerotherapy is one option and has become the primary treatment in most major centers. All patients with end-stage liver disease must be considered for liver transplantation, and sclerotherapy should be the primary method of treatment in those who are selected. Pharmacologic therapy remains controversial. I propose that portosystemic shunts and devascularization and transection operations be reserved for those few patients in whom sclerotherapy fails to eradicate the varices and to prevent recurrent variceal bleeding. Patients in whom sclerotherapy is unsuccessful should be identified and treated early.\r"

DSRS has been applied broadly in many different patient groups and has been evaluated in prospective randomized trials; thus, a considerable amount of data has accrued on the metabolic and hemodynamic consequences of selective variceal decompression. Its current role is defined as primary therapy for variceal bleeding in patients with portal vein thrombosis and good-risk patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis. As a therapy for patients whose bleeding is not controlled by sclerotherapy, it should be used as the shunt procedure of choice, but patient evaluation must focus on the choice between DSRS and liver transplantation.\r"

It is an infectious disease caused by a spirochete, B. burgdorferi, which is transmitted chiefly by I. dammini and pacificus ticks in the United States and I. ricinis in Europe. It is a disease with early and late cutaneous manifestations plus involvement of the nervous system, heart, eye, and joints in variable combinations. Diagnosis is based on patient contact with an endemic area, one or more characteristic clinical features, particularly erythema migrans rash, and a positive serologic test for B. burgdorferi infection in the majority of cases with illness greater than 4 to 6 weeks' duration. Although infection is the primary cause, immune mechanisms almost certainly play a synergistic role in some manifestations during late stages. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for full recovery. Therapy with doxycycline or amoxicillin is effective in the earliest stages but serious late complications require high doses of intravenous penicillin or ceftriaxone. Some sequelae respond well to antibiotic therapy while others such as chronic arthritis or advanced central nervous system disease may not. Anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies appear to be protective in certain experimental studies but data are limited and inconclusive in humans.\r"

Troleandomycin (250 mg once daily or every other day) and glucocorticoid doses were reduced by a standard protocol. Symptom scores, blood chemistries, pulmonary function tests, airway response to methacholine, and glucocorticoid pharmacokinetics were compared. In each group, a steroid dose reduction of 50% was achieved without a deterioration in symptom scores. Methacholine response was unchanged in all five on methylprednisolone alone, but decreased 3-fold to 30-fold in two of five on combination P-TAO, and four of five on combination MPn-TAO. Troleandomycin decreased MPn clearance by an average of 62% but did not alter prednisolone clearance. Low-dose TAO combined with MPn has a significant effect on methylprednisolone clearance in children, an effect equivalent to that reported with higher dose TAO (1000 mg/d) therapy. In addition, this preliminary study suggests that TAO may decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine in severely asthmatic children.\r"

Evaluation measures included daily symptom diary scores of six symptoms, subjective global evaluation, spirometric flow studies, and cumulative monthly steroid dosages. Baseline plasma theophylline and IgE levels were also obtained and compared with values during treatment. For the group as whole, mean FVC and FEV1 increased 10% and 17% respectively (P less than .01) and the mean of each of six symptom scores declined significantly (P less than .05). Among the nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics, the mean FVC and FEV1 rose 19% and 32% respectively (P less than .05) and mean symptom scores for five of six symptoms declined from baseline (P less than .05). Among the steroid-dependent patients, cumulative mean monthly steroid dosage required decreased 50% from 383 mg at entry to 191 mg at week 28 (P less than .01), mean FVC and FEV1 increased by 7% and 9%, although neither of these changes achieved significance, and two of six symptom scores improved (P less than .05). Comparison of pretreatment IgE levels to levels during treatment in ten patients demonstrated a fall from a mean of 645 to 339 IU/mL (P less than .05).

Thirty-one patients were treated with 1 g of elemental calcium taken daily plus 100 IU of salmon calcitonin every other day, administered subcutaneously; the remaining 31 patients received only calcium supplementation. In the calcitonin group, 11 patients dropped out of the study because of severe side effects (seven patients), lack of compliance (three patients), and exacerbation of asthma (one patient). The 20 patients who completed the 12-month follow-up period were analyzed and compared with 20 sex-matched patients from the control group. At one year, bone mineral density (BMD) had increased in the calcitonin group by a mean of 4% (p less than or equal to 0.001), whereas in the control group BMD had decreased by 2.5% (p less than or equal to 0.05). Parameters of bone remodeling (alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group but not in the control group. Our findings show that calcitonin 100 IU, given three times/wk, is an effective drug in the treatment of steroid-induced osteopenia. Side effects, however, are frequent and cause a high degree of dropout from therapy. These findings suggest that further studies should be carried out with lower doses of calcitonin or by other better tolerated forms of delivery such as in a nasal spray.\r"

In the present study, the leukotrienes (LT) C4, D4, and E4 were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) before and 5 min after endobronchial allergen challenge in four subject groups: nonatopic nonasthmatic, nonatopic asthmatic, atopic nonasthmatic, and atopic asthmatic. As determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), after allergen challenge, the predominant sulfidopeptide leukotriene found in BALF from atopic asthmatics was LTC4. Smaller amounts of LTD4 and LTE4 were detectable. The baseline level of leukotrienes in the atopic asthmatics was 64 +/- 18 pg/ml, with measurable levels being found in nine of 11 samples. Atopic nonasthmatics had measurable levels in only one of seven baseline samples, whereas five of six nonatopic subjects had undetectable levels. Allergen challenge in atopic asthmatics resulted in significant increases in LTC4 over prechallenge levels (64 +/- 18 to 616 +/- 193 pg/ml) (p less than 0.01) and over levels in the three control groups after challenge (p = 0.0297). The atopic nonasthmatic group also had detectable leukotriene levels after allergen challenge (88 +/- 32 pg/ml), whereas leukotrienes remained undetectable in five of the six nonatopic samples. For comparison, histamine and the prostanoids prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane B2 (TxB2) were also measured in BALF. The levels of all three of these mediators increased in BALF from atopic asthmatics after allergen challenge. After allergen challenge, the best correlation was found between the levels in BALF for the prostanoids PGD2 and TxB2 (r = 0.88).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ninety-six rats were inoculated subcutaneously on two successive days with 0.3 and 0.6 mg/100 g body weight of E. coli lipopolysaccharide, respectively (E animals, n = 64), or saline (C group, n = 32). E animals were divided into two groups based on subcutaneous administration of endotoxin alone (E group, n = 32) or endotoxin plus indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg body weight/day) (EI group, n = 32). Diaphragmatic strength was evaluated in 14 animals from each group 2 days after the first endotoxin or saline administration. Diaphragmatic strength was assessed by measuring the transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves at different frequencies (0.5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 Hz). Lung histologic examination and measurements of lung weights were performed 1 and 2 days after the first endotoxin or saline administration in nine animals of each group each day. A slight increase in the number of neutrophils without alveolar septal thickening and alveolar edema was observed in the lungs of endotoxin-inoculated animals. No differences in the lung weight to body weight ratio nor in the dry to wet weight ratio of the lungs were noted between C, E, and EI groups. Diaphragmatic weight was not different in the three groups, whereas the weights of the extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, and soleus muscles were significantly reduced in E compared with C and EI animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Intratracheal injection of bleomycin in rats results in the development of patchy pulmonary fibrosis. We investigated events associated with remodeling of lung structure by light and electron microscopic immunolocalization of fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen. Animals were studied from 2 to 60 days after injection of bleomycin. In the acute phase of injury, staining of fibronectin was prominent in fibrinous exudates, whereas during healing it was mainly associated with the surface of fibroblasts. The early accumulation of fibronectin in alveolar exudates is probably the result of leakage of plasma. During the reparative phase, fibronectin may be synthesized locally since it is selectively associated with the fibroblast surface. Staining with antibodies to type IV collagen and laminin identified the basal lamina and also helped to define the tissue boundaries despite the presence of intense exudation. It highlighted two processes in the acutely injured lung that lead to abnormal lung architecture: collapse of alveoli and invasion of air spaces by fibroblasts. In some healed lesions at 20 and 60 days, the immunostaining still outlined atelectatic lung. Electron microscopy of these lesions showed collagenous synechiae between approximated alveolar walls. We suggest that alveolar collapse and intraalveolar fibrosis in areas of collapse play an important role in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and probably other types of fibrosis. They readily explain the loss of lung volume and compliance characteristic of fibrotic lung.\r"

Sometime after this repair, but at least 15 months prior to presentation to this institution for placement of an aortic homograft, the pulmonary trunk band apparently slipped and migrated over the right pulmonary artery, severely limiting blood flow to the right lung and increasing flow to the left. Severe pulmonary hypertension developed, with a main pulmonary artery pressure of 94/53 mm Hg. We present clinical and radiographic evidence that the resulting chronic high blood flow and pressure in the left lung ultimately resulted in hypoperfusion of that lung, presumably secondary to chronic vascular changes with greatly increased vascular resistance. Upon surgical repair and removal of the constrictive band from the previously banded right PA, blood flow was increased to the low resistance right lung causing right-sided unilateral pulmonary edema, ventilation/perfusion mismatching, and severe hypoxemia. Perfusion studies documented that less than 10% of blood was directed to the left lung, with greater than 90% to the right. Perfusion studies 9 months postoperatively continued to demonstrate minimal blood flow to the left lung. Discussion focuses on the effects of mechanical forces and the interaction with hypoxia in causing pulmonary vascular remodeling.\r"

  ".U": "90314095\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphocyte recruitment in lymphoid tissues and inflammatory sites occurs in response to two events. The first is adherence of lymphocytes to specialized molecules expressed on the surface of appropriately stimulated vascular endothelial cells known as vascular addressins. The interaction occurs via specialized lymphocyte surface molecules known as homing receptors. There is considerable diversity among these molecules. At least three, and possibly four, different addressin-homing receptor pairs exist, regulating entry into peripheral lymph nodes, gut lymphoid tissue, BALT and intrathoracic lymphoid tissue, and inflamed synovium. Vascular addressins are expressed by specialized endothelial cells known as HEV. HEV are not found in normal lung parenchyma but may be induced to appear during an immune response. The mechanism for induction of HEV is unknown, although it may involve the action of inflammatory cytokines. It is not known whether separate endothelial cells exist with a propensity to develop into HEV or if any endothelial cells will develop into HEV if stimulated in the proper manner. Other accessory, lymphocyte-endothelium adhesion molecule pairs have been described, including LFA-1-ICAM-1 and CD4-HLA-DR. These molecules are induced by exposure of the endothelium to inflammatory cytokines, chiefly IFN-gamma. Thus, local humoral influences present during inflammation can alter the possibility of lymphocyte traffic through the endothelium by regulating the presence of lymphocyte adherence molecules. These processes have been documented to occur in the lung in normal homeostasis (e.g., BALT) and in disease (e.g., immunization with SRBC). After adherence, lymphocytes exit the circulation via amoeboid motility. This motility can be altered and enhanced through chemoattractant substances that act via surface receptors. The biochemical basis of cell motility is not entirely clear but appears to involve a link between the second messengers of receptor signaling and changes in the cytoskeleton, particularly actin filaments and microtubules. Like fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes appear to respond to a number of \"mitoattractants,\" substances that cause cell cycle entry and/or progression as well as enhanced motility. This relationship illustrates the integral relationship between cell motility and proliferation and suggests that the process of cell recruitment might also prime the recruitment cells to become activated to proliferate and perform effector function. Studies of lymphocyte-mediated lung disease confirm that antigen-specific as well as antigen-nonspecific lymphocytes are selectively recruited to the lung from the circulation during an inflammatory reaction in the lung.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90314106\r", 
  ".W": "Current data suggest that emphysema in smokers is caused at least in part by the unrestrained action of neutrophil elastase on pulmonary tissues. Since colchicine reduces the secretion of enzymes from stimulated neutrophils, we designed a clinical trial to determine if colchicine could reduce the elastase load in the lungs or several putative indicators of elastin destruction. We carried out a prospective, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. Outpatients seeking treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler who met specific criteria were recruited into the study. A group of 46 cigarette smokers between 45 and 75 yr of age with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were studied. Colchicine or placebo was given orally in disguised capsules, 0.6 mg three times per day. Volunteers were placed on a baseline bronchodilator regimen of Theodur orally and albuterol by inhalation. Blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids were obtained after 1 wk of stabilization. The patients were then randomized and treated for 14 days with colchicine, and the measurements were repeated. Modifications in plasma elastin peptides and neutrophil elastase-generated fibrinopeptide A, urinary desmosines, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid neutrophils or neutrophil elastase were the indicators of success or failure of the treatment. Pre- and posttreatment measurements in each patient and the difference between colchicine-treated and placebo-treated groups were compared. There were no statistically significant differences in either of the two types of analyses in any of the variables. We conclude that variables related to elastase load in the lungs were not modified by colchicine treatment. If a drug can be identified that is successful in modifying one of these variables, it would then have to be tested in a large-scale clinical trial in which the rate of decline in the FEV1.0 or mortality would be measured. The data presented here may provide useful information about the variability of key measurements of elastase load in the lungs and the breakdown of elastin and may aid investigators in designing similar trials in the future.\r"

  ".W": "A noninvasive, inexpensive method of excluding significant sleep-associated hypoxemia would be desirable for patients being investigated and treated for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sixty-eight such patients provided specimens before and after sleep studies for estimation of urinary uric acid:creatinine ratio (UA:Cr), serum erythropoietin (EPO), and blood 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). Mean (SD) morning 2,3-DPG was higher in 26 patients with overnight hypoxemia than in 42 normoxemic patients (2.54 [0.46] versus 2.24 [0.44] mmol/L; p = 0.01). Neither overnight change nor absolute values of serum EPO or urinary UA:Cr were significantly different between hypoxemic and normoxemic groups. There was a diurnal variation in serum EPO in normoxemic patients (P.M. EPO = 14.8 [7.1] mU/ml; A.M. EPO = 10.7 [7.1] mU/ml; p less than 0.05) but not in hypoxemic patients. Eighteen hypoxemic patients were restudied after using nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) for at least 4 wk. Seven normoxemic patients not using nCPAP were restudied after a similar time. There were no significant differences between pretreatment and posttreatment nights in absolute values or percentage overnight change of blood 2,3-DPG or serum EPO in either group. In the hypoxemic (nCPAP) group, overnight change in urinary UA:Cr was lower on the second night (p = 0.04); there was no significant change in the control group. We conclude that although urinary UA:Cr, serum EPO, and 2,3-DPG may be physiologically related to hypoxemia, none of these measures can be used to predict accurately the presence of moderate nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with OSA or in monitoring the effect of their therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Many patients with asthma experience a worsening of symptoms at night and in the early morning, resulting in sleep disruption and possibly altered daily performance. A bronchodilator agent that exerts its maximal effect overnight to control nocturnal symptoms, without a worsening of the disease during the daytime, should improve the treatment of asthma. This investigation examined the efficacy and kinetics of a new chronotherapeutically optimized, sustained-release theophylline formulation administered once daily (OD) in the evening at 8:00 P.M. in comparison with a conventional sustained-release theophylline administered twice daily (TD) at 8:00 A.M. and at 8:00 P.M. in the same dose. After a theophylline clearance study to substantiate normal or slow metabolism of the drug, a dose-titration period, and a 24-h baseline spirometric study of patients not receiving any medication, participants were randomized to 7-day treatment phases with either OD or TD. Each outpatient segment of 6 days of OD and TD was followed by a 24-h inpatient study on Day 7 when serum drug level and spirometric (PEF, FEV1, and FEF25-75) parameters were obtained every 2 h. The conventional TD treatment was associated with a constant serum theophylline level over the 24 h. In contrast, the OD treatment was associated with larger peak-to-trough drug level fluctuation, with higher levels produced overnight and lower ones in the evening at the end of the dosing interval. Compared with the baseline references, both OD and TD significantly improved airflow over the entire 24 h and to a comparable extent. However, between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M., PEF and FEV1 were significantly greater with OD than with TD. The improvement in PEF and FEV1 at this time, because of OD, was correlated with the serum theophylline level. This was not the case for TD. The improvement in airflow over baseline values between 2:00 and 6:00 P.M. was not correlated with theophylline level with either treatment regime. Overall, the chronotherapeutically conceptualized OD treatment administered in the evening resulted in better airflow levels overnight than did the TD regime without loss of airflow in the afternoon.\r"

A normal, healthy control group of 12 subjects was also recruited. Compared with Group A, Group B had a reduced recovery percentage of infused volume (p less than 0.05) and total cell number (p less than 0.01). Compared with the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of eosinophils (p less than 0.05) in both groups of asthmatics. In Group A there was also a significant increase in mast cells (p less than 0.05), serum-ECP (p less than 0.05), and BAL-ECP (p less than 0.001). No correlations between any of the cell variables and the level of airway responsiveness measured as PC20 histamine were found in any group. Group A patients were investigated twice--before and after 4 wk of randomly allocated treatment with either a regular beta-2-receptor agonist (terbutaline 250 micrograms, two puffs four times a day) or a regularly inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide 200 micrograms twice a day). The BAL differential cell counts were similar and not significantly affected by either treatment. However, BAL-ECP levels were decreased by budesonide treatment (p less than 0.05). ECP levels in serum and BAL were significantly correlated (p less than 0.05 to 0.001). The eosinophilic cell involvement in asthma is further emphasized by this study but the increase in numbers of eosinophils seems less important than their activity, here measured as release of one degranulation product, ECP. To suppress disease activity, repeated long-term treatment is important, but clear preference for either treatment cannot be given on the basis of our present results.\r"

Patients with such adrenal \"incidentalomas\" typically have no clinical manifestations of adrenal cortical hyperfunction at the time of discovery. We have studied 122 patients with asymptomatic adrenal masses ranging in size from 2 to 7 cm in diameter from 1978 to 1988. Selected patients, after adrenal metastases, pheochromocytoma, myelolipomas, and cysts were ruled out, were further evaluated for adrenal cortical hyperfunction by measuring urinary 17-hydroxysteroids, 17-ketosteroids, and free cortisol, serum A.M., P.M. cortisol, and plasma ACTH levels. These values were also measured before and after dexamethasone suppression. NP-59 adrenal scintiscans were performed on all patients. Six patients were identified with sub-clinical Cushing's syndrome. Baseline cortisol levels were normal in each of these patients. Loss of diurnal rhythm appeared to be the most sensitive indicator of abnormal adrenal cortical function. When adrenalectomy is performed in such patients, especially when contralateral adrenal gland suppression is evidenced by NP-59 scanning or other biochemical assessment, perioperative steroids should be administered in a manner similar to that used for patients with symptomatic Cushing's syndrome. Unilateral adrenalectomy in a patient with an asymptomatic adrenal adenoma, insufficiently studied, may result in Addisonian crisis.\r"

This paper reports the findings in a child with ligneous conjunctivitis who was followed for 1 1/2 years and who had laryngeal and tracheobronchial involvement with voice change and airway obstruction. The literature is reviewed and the histopathologic findings and endoscopic findings and management of the patient are documented. Because the patient had multiple papillomata of both hands, a possible association with human papillomavirus was suspected but never confirmed.\r"

It is less aggressive in the larynx than elsewhere: cervical or distant metastases are rare (8.5%), and although local recurrences are not uncommon, they are not catastrophic. A retrospective study was made on eight cases of laryngeal chondrosarcoma. Three cases had originally been diagnosed as idiopathic vocal cord paralysis, possibly because of early involvement of the cricoarytenoid joint or the distal portion of the recurrent nerve. This fact emphasizes the need for accurate laryngeal computed tomography in cases of vocal cord paralysis of unknown origin. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for laryngeal chondrosarcoma, and conservative techniques may sometimes be appropriate. Supraglottic laryngectomy may be the technique of choice in the rare cases of epiglottic involvement.\r"

We reviewed the literature on temporal bone autopsies from 1938 to 1988, and selected 72 cases for histologic examination. Of the 72 cases, 67 (93%) showed endolymphatic hydrops, 2 (2.8%) showed collapse, and 3 (4.2%) showed membranous labyrinths of normal appearance. Twenty of the 67 endolymphatic hydrops cases (29.9%) displayed bilateral involvement, suggesting a rate of bilaterality in Meniere's disease of approximately 30%.\r"

The results of the investigation have suggested that the HSN test has a 27% sensitivity and an 85% specificity.

They also provided a detailed description of their recommended technique for dissection, transection, and closure of each major structure. This was an important departure from the previously described mass ligation techniques. This cadaver experience was effectively transferred to the operating room. Kent and Blades reported on 18 patients who underwent lower lobectomy without mortality or the dreaded complication of \"putrid empyema.\" They high-lighted several basic thoracic surgical principles necessary for successful lower lobectomy that are as valid today as they were then. This landmark report provided the impetus for thoracic surgeons to accept lobectomy as a safe and standard anatomical resection.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic valve insufficiency with ventricular septal defect is usually treated by plication of the commissures. However, long-term deterioration is common. We propose a new technique that corrects the aortic annulus dilatation and the leaflet prolapse and reinforces the sinus of Valsalva. Two groups were compared: group I (29 patients) had plication of the prolapsed leaflet(s) and folding of the free edge; group II (26 patients) had triangular resection of the prolapse cusp, annuloplasty, and reinforcement of the aortic wall. The two groups were similar with regarding to preoperative clinical data. There was no perioperative mortality. Primary failure (aortic valve replacement) occurred in 8 patients in group I (28%) and in 2 patients in group II (8%). The rate of secondary failure was 31% in group I and 4% in group II. The actuarial rate of freedom from reoperation at 5 years is 55% in group I and 88% in group II (p less than 0.05). The late mortality was 6.5% in group I and 10.9% in group II (no difference). We conclude that aortic valve insufficiency with ventricular septal defect is a malformation of the aortic leaflets, the annulus, and the sinus of Valsalva, and that the proposed technique offers a better result than the usual methods in terms of residual aortic valve insufficiency.\r"

Significant variables for coronary artery bypass grafting after logistic regression analysis in order of importance are previous cardiac operation, priority of operation, New York Heart Association functional class, peripheral vascular disease, age, pulmonary rales, current diuretic use, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. For patients undergoing valve or other cardiac operations with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, those variables found to be significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis are priority of operation; age; peripheral vascular disease; great vessel repair; all other except aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and great vessel repair; mitral valve replacement; and cardiomegaly. By identifying these current risk factors and the coefficients from the multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, expected mortality can be calculated. We propose that the ratio of observed to expected mortality is a better measure of quality of care than unadjusted mortality.\r"

The highest incidence of valve-related postoperative deaths after aortic valve replacements in Stockholm was anticoagulation-related bleeding, which continued at a rate of about 1% year after year. There is a need to improve the quality of life for heart valve patients, especially for children, for young females who want to have children, for the older generation who are on medical treatment, and for all patients in whom long-term anticoagulation of a perfect quality is impossible to guarantee. A series of tests on goats has been performed, using the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve used in 2,024 patients at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm and in 75,000 patients worldwide for up to 8 years with a modification of a microporous surface. In the mitral position, this modified partially microporous-surfaced Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve has permitted goats to live for 5 years with four normal pregnancies without anticoagulation therapy.\r"

A review of the world literature reveals only 9 previous cases. In 6 of the 11 patients the diagnosis was either missed or delayed. In 4 patients the diagnosis was delayed or missed because of the absence of a superior mediastinal hematoma, and in 2 patients the diagnosis was delayed because of inadequate (single-plane) aortography. Suspicion may be lacking because of absence of the upper mediastinal hematoma considered to be the sine qua non for the diagnosis of aortic rupture. Although deceleration is considered to be the mechanism of injury in tears at the isthmus, severe hyperextension (often associated with fracture dislocation of the underlying thoracic vertebra) is considered to be the causative factor in descending aortic tears. Experience with the 2 patients presented here demonstrates that a high index of suspicion and complete two-plane aortography is required to avoid the potential for catastrophic outcome subsequent to overlooking a tear of the mid-descending aorta.\r"

These patients are characterized by young age, long duration of Cushing's syndrome because of the inability to find the ectopic source, and a high incidence of hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy without curing the disease. A substantial number of patients, upon discovery of the thoracic ectopic source, are also found to have malignant carcinoid tumors with lymph node metastases. Fifteen patients have been explored for a presumed intrathoracic source of ACTH at our institution since 1983 and 14 carcinoids (13 bronchial, one thymic) have been resected. Seventy-one percent (10/14) of the patients appear cured with normal plasma ACTH levels 5 to 57 months after resection, despite a 50% incidence of positive lymph node disease. Management of these patients demands an aggressive evaluation to prevent unnecessary adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy and to allow earlier resections before these potentially curable malignancies metastasize. When the tumor is discovered, thorough exploration and complete lymph node mapping with resection must be performed.\r"

  ".W": "Carcinoid tumors arising in the thymus are rare. Since Rosai and Higa in 1972 distinguished these neoplasms from thymomas, fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the world literature. In a 38-year review (1950 to 1988) of surgically treated thymic tumors at Henry Ford Hospital, only 7 cases of thymic carcinoids were identified. These 6 men and 1 woman ranged in age from 27 to 70 years (mean, 48 years) at diagnosis. Follow-up was available in all patients with the longest survival being 12 years in 2 patients, and the shortest, 1 year, in 1. Recurrences and/or metastases developed in 4 of 7 patients between 1 and 9 years after initial resection. Recurrences were treated by reexcision in addition to radiation treatment and chemotherapy in 3 patients and reexcision with radiation treatment alone in 1 patient. A review of the literature along with our experience suggests that thymic carcinoids have a biological behavior distinct from thymoma in terms of cell origin, associated syndromes, neoplastic behavior, and prognosis. An aggressive surgical approach with complete initial excision of the tumor and of subsequent recurrences, along with radiation and probably chemotherapy, is the best available treatment today.\r"

Between 1978 and 1989, we replaced the ascending aorta or aortic arch with this device in 49 patients. At no time were we unable to use a sutureless graft during a procedure. Twenty-eight cases of aneurysmal disease and 21 cases of acute or chronic dissection were treated. Twenty-six patients required replacement of the aortic valve, with annuloartic ectasia being the most common indication (71%). Ten patients underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. The operative mortality rate for ascending aortic aneurysm repairs was 4%, and that for dissections was 18%. Five of 8 patients requiring aortic arch replacement survived. Most patients were studied angiographically before discharge. No complications were related to anastomotic hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm formation, graft migration, or thromboemboli. Individual cases of phrenic nerve palsy, acute tubular necrosis, and transient ischemic attack, all of which resolved completely, were identified. The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 64%. We conclude that modification of the sutureless intraluminal ring graft to suit the pathology encountered at operation allows the quickest repair with the least chance of anastomotic complication.\r"

To validate these beliefs, physicians were asked to predict the presence of active gastrointestinal tract bleeding and whether bile was present in a nasogastric aspirate obtained immediately before endoscopy in 73 episodes of bleeding in 62 patients. A relationship was found between the physician's assessment of the presence of active bleeding demonstrated endoscopically and the appearance of the nasogastric aspirate. However, the sensitivity and specificity were low (79% and 55%, respectively). No association between the assessment of bile in the nasogastric aspirate and the presence of bile acids was demonstrated. These data do not support the placement of a nasogastric tube to determine whether or not a patient is bleeding, the location of the bleeding, and whether endoscopy should be performed.\r"

Abnormal pulmonary function has been detected in some diabetic patients; the most consistent abnormalities are reduced lung volumes in young (aged less than 25 years) insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, reduced pulmonary elastic recoil in both young and adult (aged greater than 25 years) diabetic subjects, and impaired diffusion due to a reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume in the adult group. Nonenzymatic glycosylation-induced alteration of lung connective tissue is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism underlying mechanical pulmonary dysfunction in diabetic subjects, while the most tenable explanation for impaired pulmonary microangiopathy. these patients is the presence of underlying pulmonary microangiopathy. The finding of abnormal lung function in some diabetic subjects suggests that the lung should be considered a \"target organ\" in diabetes mellitus; however, the clinical implications of these findings in terms of respiratory disease are at present unknown.\r"

Few data, however, are available about the potential complications arising from asymptomatic bacteriuria (eg, the development of symptomatic infection and renal damage) for various patient populations and for various medical conditions. On the basis of data in the literature, we believe that neonates and preschool children with asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated. Pregnant women and \"nonelderly\" (less than 60 years old) men should be treated. We do not think that school-age children, nonpregnant, nonelderly women, or elderly men and women need antimicrobial treatment if their urinary tracks are normal. In addition, antimicrobial treatment is recommended for patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and abnormal urinary tracts and those undergoing clean intermittent catheterization, genitourinary manipulation, or instrumentation. Patients with long-term indwelling catheters should not be treated. The treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with short-term indwelling catheters and those with ileal conduits is controversial. These treatment recommendations should not necessarily be accepted as the standards of practice, since treatment is often controversial due to the lack of published data describing the natural course of asymptomatic bacteriuria in various patient populations.\r"

To determine whether bias may have played a role in the generation of these widely varying estimates, a set of methodologic criteria were applied to the published original research dealing with the epidemiology of PPT. The articles that passed these methodologic filters reported a narrow range of incidences of PPT, varying between 3.7% and 5.9%. Reanalysis of these articles confirmed that thyrotoxicosis occurred more frequently in the first 3 months post partum than did hypothyroidism, and that a positive antimicrosomal antibody titer was strongly associated with postpartum thyroid dysfunction (odds ratio, 86.6; 95% confidence interval, 45.9 to 163.2). This article suggests that PPT is a common condition that occurs in the postpartum period. The best estimate of the incidence of PPT in an unselected cohort of postpartum women is 4.9%.\r"

The purpose of the study was to compare laboratory procedures for the diagnosis of catheter-related infections and also to attempt to clarify the present controversy regarding the portal of entry of such infections. The IVCs were removed by one of us and multiple samples were studied according to a standard procedure. Semi-quantitative cultures were performed of the tips, the interior of the hub, and the skin around the insertion point. Quantitative cultures were performed of the infusion fluid and of the IVC tips. Of the 139 IVCs studied, 53 (38.1%) were infected (greater than or equal to 15 colony-forming units per plate in the semiquantitative culture). Semi-quantitative and quantitative cultures gave comparable results, but the semiquantitative procedure proved to be easier and faster. All but three infected catheters had a positive (greater than or equal to 15 colony-forming units per plate) skin and/or hub culture (superficial cultures), with microorganisms identical to those isolated in the IVC tip. Our results showed two possible and differentiable portals of entry. Thirty (56.6%) had external origin (semiquantitative skin culture positive), 12 (22.6%) had an internal origin (semiquantitative hub culture positive), and 8 (15.1%) had both origins. All catheters with negative superficial cultures had a negative tip. The predictive value of positive superficial cultures in the diagnosis of catheter-related infection was 66.2% and that of negative cultures was 96.7%. In patients with suspected catheter-related infections but negative superficial cultures, the possibility of infection may reasonably be ruled out, thereby avoiding many unnecessary catheter withdrawals.\r"

  ".U": "90314600\r", 
  ".W": "A retrospective study of 221 surgically resected thyroid nodules disclosed that 71 (32%) were cystic and 150 (68%) were solid lesions. Ultrasonography correctly characterized cystic nodules in all but one case. Comparing cystic and solid nodules, there were no differences in patient demographics (mean ages, 47.7 +/- 1.8 SEM vs 45.9 +/- 1.2 years; sex, 78% females both groups), the proportion that were solitary (39% vs 40%), or the nodule size (49% vs 47% greater than or equal to 2 cm in diameter). Of cystic thyroid lesions, 4% were simple cysts, 82% were degenerating benign adenomas or colloid nodules, and 14% were malignant compared with 23% of solid lesions that were malignant. Most cystic lesions (81%) contained bloody fluid. One benign true cyst was filled with thick brown fluid, while clear yellow fluid was repeatedly aspirated from one malignant cystic nodule. Malignant fine-needle aspiration cytology was the best predictor of cancer (100%). Much less predictable were signs of local compression or invasion (43%), a history of head or neck irradiation (33%), cyst recurrence after aspiration (29%), or an increase in the cystic nodule's size (7%). Indeterminate cytology identified malignancy with about half the frequency in cystic lesions as compared with solid nodules (13% vs 27%). The only false-negative fine-needle aspiration cytology occurred in a cystic lesion. In patients with cystic papillary cancers, needle aspirates contained insufficient material for diagnosis in 20% that occurred in no patient with solid papillary carcinoma. The sensitivities and specificities of fine-needle aspiration cytology for solid nodules were 100% and 55%, and for cystic nodules were 88% and 52%. Thus, cystic lesions are as likely as solid thyroid lesions to harbor a malignancy that cannot be predicted from the cyst's clinical characteristics or the patient's demographic data. Although fine-needle biopsy is the best predictor of malignancy in either cystic or solid thyroid lesions, it is slightly less reliable when a thyroid lesion is fluid filled rather than solid. We believe that most cysts not abolished by aspiration should be surgically excised.\r"

Gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues can prevent ovulation by reducing secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. In six patients with well-documented acute intermittent porphyria and frequent cyclical exacerbations, daily administration of an agonistic gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue, ([ImBzl]-D-His6,Pro9-NET)gonadotropin releasing hormone, intranasally or subcutaneously for as long as 26 months reduced or eliminated premenstrual attacks and caused only minor side effects. Adjustments in dosage or route of administration were sometimes needed. We conclude that endocrine manipulation by treatment with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist will prevent neurovisceral attacks of acute intermittent porphyria due to cyclical changes in endogenous hormones and is a safe alternative to exogenous steroids, which may induce attacks of this disease.\r"

In every case, the lesion appeared ophthalmoscopically similar to a choroidal malignant melanoma. However, fluorescein angiography showed neither choroidal fluorescence blockage nor the double-circulation pattern characteristic of choroidal melanomas. Instead, each lesion exhibited a central fluorescein pattern similar to that of the surrounding uninvolved choroid, relative marginal hypofluorescence, and overlying choroidal folds. Ultrasonography revealed acoustic hollowness of each lesion without choroidal excavation. The lesions disappeared completely within 1 to 2 months, leaving no visible trace. We discuss the differential diagnosis of these lesions and stress the diagnostic value of fluorescein angiography.\r"

Eight of the 10 reported darkening to occur with the opaque patch, while none reported it with the translucent occluder. The darkening occurred with a mean latency of 10.9 seconds, occupied 34.4% of the time, and on average occurred 3.25 times per minute. With the translucent occluder, retest threshold variability was 18.8% less and sensitivity was increased by 0.7 dB.

All were studied in a crossover design employing a 200 mEq and 10 mEq Na/day. High salt led to a decrease in diastolic pressure for all groups (P less than .002). For systolic pressure, there was no salt effect on blood pressure across the whole group; however amongst the hypertensives, particularly the black hypertensives, high salt led to increases in systolic pressure (P less than .022). Obese patients were more likely to increase their systolic pressure in response to salt loading (P less than .05). The patients whose pressure increased on high salt were those who manifested less of a decrease in plasma levels of norepinephrine and renin in response to salt loading (both P less than .05). Systolic salt sensitivity was predicted with high statistical power (R = 0.689, P less than .00001) by a multiple regression equation employing: race; diagnosis; the change in renin and norepinephrine levels with diet; and the change in BP sensitivity to infused norepinephrine across the two diets. In view of the findings of increased norepinephrine, renin and diastolic pressure on low salt and in view of the particular physiological and epidemiological setting associated with systolic salt sensitivity, one wonders about the advisability of across-the-board recommendations of low salt diets for all hypertensive patients.\r"

Simultaneous infusion of magnesium sulphate (5 mumols/kg/min) attenuated the MAP elevation (157.0 +/- 5.2 (SE) v 141.6 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, P less than .01) and the increase in PAC (447 +/- 70 v 233 +/- 50 pg/mL, P less than .01) brought about by angiotensin II. These effects of magnesium were abolished when endogenous angiotensin II was suppressed by the administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The results suggest that magensium may attenuate the biological actions of angiotensin II.\r"

  ".W": "Because left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality considerable interest has been generated concerning the possible effects of modifying LVH in hypertensive patients. In animal models disproportionate regression of left ventricular (LV) mass in relation to blood pressure may produce adverse effects on coronary blood flow reserve or LV systolic function. Clinical studies of modulation of LVH with antihypertensive drug therapy have been of two types: (1) large scale community comparison trials in which the prevalence of LVH and its regression were evaluated serially by electrocardiography (ECG) with stepped care drug therapy and (2) relatively short term (less than 2 years) studies with echocardiographic (ECHO) determination of LVH. The development of anatomically validated measurement of LV muscle mass by ECHO has demonstrated ECHO to be much more sensitive than ECG to assessment of LVH. Community comparison trials of stepped care therapy such as the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and Hypertension Detection and Followup Study (HDFP) have not had the statistical power to demonstrate significant effects on risk reduction despite evidence for significant decrease in ECG-LVH despite participant numbers in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 followed serially for 5 to 6 years. Analysis of over 60 studies of hypertensive treatment using ECHO for assessment of LVH mass changes, averaging 10 to 15 subjects/study, indicates that correlation of reduction of LV mass with decrease in blood pressure has been weak (r = 0.255, P less than .025). Drug monotherapy studies have shown that use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors predominantly decrease LV mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Somatostatin immunoreactive nerves were not found in the skin of atopic dermatitis, whereas a normal pattern of immunoreactivity could be detected in most of the healthy subjects. Neuropeptide Y-positive dendritic epidermal cells were observed in lesional skin from patients with atopic dermatitis, but not in controls. Calcitonin gene-related peptide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide immunoreactivity in patients with atopic dermatitis did not differ from that in healthy subjects. With galanin antiserum a diffuse intracellular staining was observed in the epidermis of both atopic patients and controls, while no positive staining was found with either neurotensin or neurokinin A antibodies in either group. These findings suggest a possible involvement of some neuropeptides in the pathomechanisms of atopic dermatitis.\r"

At higher doses, morphological changes develop which may result, particularly in severe cases, in acute or chronic renal failure. The threshold for the development of irreversible vascular-interstitial lesions mainly depends on the increment of serum creatinine, age and drug dosage or drug blood level. Based on the experience with cyclosporin A (CyA), the following recommendations have been made for its clinical use, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases. The initial dose should not exceed 5 mg/kg body weight and the dose should be reduced if blood CyA levels are over 250 ng/ml; in addition, a dose reduction is recommended if serum creatinine values exceed 30% of pre-treatment values or if other signs of CyA toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity or hypertension, are found. Strict adherence to these suggestions should allow treatment of patients for prolonged periods without irreversible morphological lesions.\r"

Chronic degenerative and pigmentary skin changes similar to those of chronic solar exposure occur after long-term PUVA treatment; PUVA also causes non-melanoma skin cancers in man, although there is, as yet, no consensus as to what cumulative phototoxic PUVA dose is carcinogenic. Long-term multicentre studies from the U.S.A. indicate a definite risk of squamous cell carcinoma for long-term PUVA-treated patients, whereas European studies reveal no overall increase in skin cancers in similar patients except for those exposed to other carcinogens. Assignment to PUVA should be based on the risk:benefit ratio for the individual patient. Careful patient selection is therefore mandatory and should be limited to those who can be monitored and controlled by informed, competent and conscientious physicians.\r"

Serious toxic reactions are recognized, but can be avoided if the drug is used correctly. The most important side-effects are haematopoietic and hepatotoxic. It is well established that long-term methotrexate can induce liver damage which, in a number of patients, may lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis. Recent studies have, however, documented that the methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis is not aggressive. Interaction can occur with a number of drugs; serious problems in particular may arise with concomitant use of sulphonamides and salicylates. The recommended guidelines for methotrexate use in psoriasis should be followed and patients given clear instructions.\r"

In dermatology, oral CyA is most effective in the treatment of psoriasis and has been used successfully for plaque-type, pustular and erythrodermic forms of the disease. While dosages ranging from 1 to 14 mg/kg/day have been used, a starting dose of 4 mg/kg/day gives a rapid response with few side-effects. Nephrotoxicity remains the greatest concern in long-term use of the drug. Although intralesional CyA has proven effective in psoriasis, topical preparations have not. It is hoped that future research will provide effective topical formulations of CyA which are efficacious without the risks inherent in systemic administration.\r"

Data derived from a double-blind placebo-controlled study (5 mg/kg/day of CyA), dose-finding studies (2.5 mg vs 5 mg/kg/day and 1 mg, 2 mg or 3 mg/kg/day), and long-term treatment of chronic plaque-type psoriasis (1.1-7.2 mg/kg/day) suggest an initial starting dose of 3 mg/kg/day irrespective of the severity of the disease. Long-term treatment brought about dose- and time-dependent (reversible) side-effects, including renal dysfunction and hypertension. Efforts to reduce the dose included concomitant administration of drugs known to have anti-psoriatic efficacy. Only combination with topical steroids appeared to add to the clinical efficacy of CyA, but did not allow a dose reduction sufficient to restore renal function. Dose reduction through intermittent treatment, however, postponed exacerbations sufficiently to permit at least partial normalization of serum creatinine levels. A similar effect was seen in the treatment of pustular palmoplantar psoriasis, which responded to doses of 1.1-6.1 mg/kg/day.\r"

Infections are not a problem. As expected with an immunosuppressive drug, there is the possible risk of tumour development, particularly squamous cell carcinomas. However, these skin malignancies developed almost exclusively in patients previously treated with PUVA and/or methotrexate. The few lymphoproliferative disorders regressed spontaneously on discontinuation of the drug. Whether the isolated cases of solid tumours were CyA-related is not known. Apart from a raised serum creatinine, an important indicator of renal dysfunction, the laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesaemia, hyperkalaemia, increased uric acid, changes in liver function tests, and fluctuations in the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Although most of these changes were not clinically relevant, laboratory monitoring of patients with psoriasis treated with CyA is essential.\r"

Creatinine increases of 50% or more over baseline values were detected in 4% of the patients receiving 2.5 mg/kg/day and in 13% of those receiving 5 mg/kg/day. After an initial rise during the first weeks of treatment, mean creatinine level remained stable over 1 year provided that the CyA dose was reduced whenever creatinine levels increased by 30% or more over baseline. The incidence of hypertension was 10.6% and did not vary whether the CyA dose was 2.5 or 5 mg/kg/day. The first elevated blood pressures were recorded early after starting CyA therapy (median: 1 month).

Neutralizing antisera to both recombinant IL-3 and GM-CSF were used to evaluate the relationship among these sources of Meg-CSA. Varying dilutions of IL-3 and GM-CSF antisera were tested in plasma clot cultures of normal human peripheral blood megakaryocyte progenitors optimally stimulated by either IL-3 (1 U/mL), GM-CSF (1 U/mL), PHA-LCM (2.5% to 5% vol/vol), or aplastic human serum (10% vol/vol). IL-3 antiserum at dilutions up to 1/2,000 totally abrogated megakaryocyte colony growth stimulated by IL-3. A 1/500 dilution of GM-CSF antiserum completely eliminated GM-CSF-induced megakaryocyte colony development. A combination of anti-IL-3 and anti-GM-CSF, each at a 1/500 dilution, inhibited all megakaryocyte colony growth stimulated by optimal concentrations of IL-3 and GM-CSF together. There was no neutralizing crossreactivity between the IL-3 and GM-CSF antisera. At maximally neutralizing concentrations, IL-3 antiserum inhibited 66% of the megakaryocyte colony growth stimulated by PHA-LCM. Residual megakaryocyte colony growth was eliminated by the addition of a 1/500 dilution of anti-GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have examined the effects of ethanol on gene expression in this cell line. The results show that while ethanol induces a more differentiated phenotype, this agent has little effect on the self-renewal capacity of HL-60 cells. Ethanol treatment was also associated with a concentration-dependent and transient downregulation of c-myc transcripts. Similar effects were observed for c-myb mRNA levels. The results further show that ethanol exposure is associated with induction of tumor necrosis factor gene expression. These findings indicate that ethanol induces changes in specific gene expression during non-terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells. The clinical effects of this agent could thus be related to altered patterns of gene expression in hematopoietic or other cells.\r"

  ".W": "The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a role in the regulation of normal as well as leukemic hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IL-1 induces autocrine granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, and these factors may then synergistically induce proliferation in AML blast cells. In this report, we show that IL-1 stimulates DNA synthesis of highly enriched normal bone marrow blast cells (CD34 positive, adherent cell depleted, CD3/CD14/CD15 negative). The stimulative effect of IL-1 can be blocked with neutralizing anti-TNF alpha and anti-GM-CSF antibodies and, most efficiently, by the combination of anti-TNF alpha and anti-GM-CSF, but not with anti-G-CSF antibody, suggesting that IL-1-induced proliferation was initiated through TNF and GM-CSF release. Concentrations of TNF and GM-CSF increased in the culture medium of normal bone marrow blast cells after IL-1 induction. Of the IL-1-induced cells, 12% were positive for GM-CSF mRNA by in situ hybridization, as opposed to 6% of non-induced cells. Thus, in addition to its effect on leukemic blast cells, IL-1 also acts on normal marrow blast cells. We propose a scheme where IL-1 stimulation of normal bone marrow blast cells leads to the induction of TNF alpha and GM-CSF, which in association stimulate DNA synthesis efficiently according to a paracrine or autocrine mechanism within the marrow blast cell compartment.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant (r) and natural human (h) macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF-1) have been considered poor stimulators of macrophage progenitor cells present in human marrow, although they are potent stimulators of these cells in mouse marrow. We compared the growth characteristics of rhM-CSF-responsive human macrophage progenitor cells placed in semisolid agarose or agar culture medium and incubated for 14 days at ambient (approximately 20%) or lowered (5%) O2 tension. By itself, rhM-CSF was found to be a good stimulator of macrophage colony formation by human bone marrow cells cultured in agarose but not in agar; this growth was enhanced by incubation at 5% O2. Maximal numbers (up to 115/10(5) nonadherent low density cells plated) of macrophage colonies (50 to greater than 500 cells per colony) were stimulated by 500 to 1,000 units rhM-CSF/mL, with 1/2 maximal numbers stimulated by 250 to 500 units/mL. With agarose as the support medium, rhM-CSF was two- to fourfold more active on mouse than on human macrophage colony formation, in contrast to previous reports of 10- to 100-fold greater activity when agar was used as the support medium. Using nonadherent low density T lymphocyte-depleted human bone marrow cells growing in agarose at 5% O2, greater than additive effects on colony formation were observed when 31 to 500 units rhM-CSF were used in combination with either 10 ng rh interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), 20, or 200 units rh granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF or rhG-CSF. The agarose assay system should be useful for evaluating factors regulating the proliferation of human macrophage progenitor cells in vitro and during clinical trials with rhM-CSF.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of recombinant products of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), human interleukin-3 (IL-3), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were studied using purified target cell populations from patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation after myeloablative therapy. Cells were subjected to combined purification procedures including negative selection with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CD2, 3, 5, 10, and 20). The purified cells were enriched for HLA-DR+ (51% to 71%) and My-10+ (CD34; 37% to 54%) and had a plating efficiency of up to 20%. In the liquid-suspension limiting dilution clonal assay (LDA), purified progenitors responded directly to IL-3 by proliferation with single-hit kinetics. The ability of GM-CSF to support progenitor growth was inferior to that of IL-3, and the cells were virtually unresponsive when cultured with G-CSF, supporting the notion that these blood-derived progenitors belong to a primitive population of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The results obtained in simultaneous methycellulose cultures (MC) showed the same trend and provided additional information on the ability of GM-CSF and IL-3 to support erythroid progenitor growth. The combination of IL-3 plus G-CSF, but not IL-3 plus GM-CSF, resulted in a synergistic increase in colony number. IL-1 alpha increased both the size and number of colonies when added to IL-3 or G-CSF. Study of this enriched progenitor cell population in MC and LDA represents an excellent model for the investigation of myeloid and erythroid differentiation and for evaluating the influence of various cytokines on human hematopoiesis.\r"

Studies on its expression have been hampered by the difficulties in obtaining purified megakaryocytes in a sufficient number. We report a suspension liquid culture procedure that allowed isolation of more than 1 x 10(6) megakaryocytes with a purity ranging from 3% to 88% from the blood of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, from fetal liver or from normal human bone marrow. GPIb was detected on the plasma membrane of all maturing megakaryocytes and also of promegakaryoblasts devoid of demarcation membranes. GPIb was detected on demarcation membranes of maturing megakaryocytes but was absent from all other organelles, including alpha granules. Biosynthesis of 35S-methionine labeled megakaryocytes showed that GPIb with similar electrophoretic mobility to the platelet molecule was synthesized and that it was also composed of two chains, since its molecular weight shifted in reducing conditions from 170 Kd to 145 Kd. The beta chain remained undetectable after methionine metabolic labeling, but it was immunoprecipitated after 3H-leucine metabolic labeling, confirming that this subunit is devoid of methionine. GPIb was associated with GPIX, as it is in platelets, since anti-GPIb antibodies coprecipitated a 17 Kd polypeptide.\r"

  ".W": "Two regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were compared with the goal of identifying a regimen with a greater than 50% complete response (CR) rate. Patients with a performance status of 0 to 2 and normal end-organ function were randomized to receive either four cycles of neoadjuvant methotrexate, cisplatin, and continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (MPF) (arm A), or four cycles of bleomycin, cisplatin, and methotrexate (PBM) alternating with cisplatin and 5-FU (PF) (arm B). Patients with a performance status of greater than 2 or a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of less than 50% of the predicted value were assigned to the arm A regimen but were analyzed separately (arm C). Local therapy consisted of surgery (for patients with resectable disease) or radiation therapy followed by two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the regimen that was administered initially. Of the 42 patients who were evaluated, 16 were randomized to arm A, 13 to arm B, and 13 to arm C. The clinical CR rate was 19% on arm A (95% confidence interval, 0% to 38%), 39% on arm B (95% confidence interval, 12% to 66%) (P = 0.41), and 54% on arm C (95% confidence interval, 27% to 81%). At a median follow-up time of 35 months, the 2-year actuarial survival rate was 61% on arm A, 69% on arm B (the P value was not significant), and 38% on arm C. The 2-year survival rate for all 42 patients who were treated was 57% and the median survival time was 31 months. Toxicities of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on all arms consisted of mild to moderate myelosuppression and renal toxicity. The incidence of moderate to severe mucositis was significantly higher on arm A than arm B (P = 0.02). Two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to only 11 of 42 patients due to patient refusal or cumulative toxicity. In conclusion, both neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens resulted in similar response and survival rates, but mucositis was more severe with arm A. However, since neither regimen was likely to cause a CR rate of greater than 50%, this study was closed to further patient accrual.\r"

  ".W": "During the 1970s, information obtained from animal tumor models and from patients with a spectrum of solid tumors indicated the worth of a variety of immunostimulating agents. These findings provided a biological and clinical rationale for conducting randomized trials to evaluate the worth of those agents. Consequently, in May 1977 the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) implemented a randomized trial to determine whether Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum, CP) plus chemotherapy would be more effective than chemotherapy alone in prolonging the disease-free survival (DFS) and survival (S) of patients with primary operable breast cancer and positive axillary nodes. The results of that trial through 8 years of follow-up fail to indicate that treatment with CP used in conjunction with l-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) plus 5-fluorouracil (PF) results in a better DFS and S than that observed after chemotherapy alone. Use of the immunomodulator has instead resulted in a poorer, but not statistically significant, outcome. Despite adjustments made to account for any imbalance in distribution of prognostic factors between the two treatment groups and despite considering treatment compliance as a factor, the unfavorable outcome persisted. A high incidence of fever and chills was associated with the administration of CP. The administration of hydrocortisone before each CP treatment reduced the frequency of those and other systemic effects. The failure to demonstrate a benefit from CP is in keeping with the failure of other nonspecific stimulating agents to contribute to the creation of a new paradigm for the treatment of breast cancer.\r"

Neuroectodermal associated antigens, reacting with MoAb UJ13/A, UJ127.11, UJ167.11, and UJ223.8 were detected on greater than 10% of the cells in 15 of 17 MED/SPNET.

NF-H was demonstrated in 15 of 17, NF-M in six of 17 and NF-L in one of 17 tumors; GFAP was positive in nine of 17 patients. In nine of 17 MED/SPNET both proteins were present within the same tumor. Common leukocyte antigen was demonstrated on greater than 50% of the cells in four of 14 tumors as were shared tumor/leukocyte markers using monoclonal antibodies Thy-1, PI153/3, UJ308. The most frequent MED immunophenotype analysis was UJ 13/A+, UJ 127.11+, UJ 167.11+, UJ223.8+, PI 153/3+, A2B5+, GFAP+, NF-H+, and CLA-, NF-M-, NF-L-, 215-, 275-, 282.1-. The authors conclude that MED and SPNET are heterogeneous for expression of 16 markers and have similar immunophenotype analysis profiles, supporting the concept of their common, neuroectodermal origin. Common leukocyte antigen on both tumor cells and leukocytes precludes identification of tumor infiltrating leukocytes using monostaining techniques.\r"

Furthermore, ten cases of lesions that regressed during a 1-year follow-up period were positive for ras p21 in 20% of cases, but 14 cases of lesions that progressed and developed into higher graded lesions during the 2- to 5-year follow-up period had a 50.0% rate of positive p21 staining.

  ".W": "Selective involvement of the B-cell compartment of lymph node by B-cell malignant lymphomas is an occasional finding related to early phases of lymph node infiltration. The authors have observed a unique case of diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma that consisted of immunohistologically and genotypically proven B-clonal population exhibiting a repetitive pattern of infiltration in three lymph node samples obtained from the patient during a 9-year period. This pattern consisted of a selective and complete replacement of the B-areas with disappearance of follicles and widening of the medullary cords, an expanded T-zone showing features consistent with dermatopathic lymphadenitis and well-preserved sinuses. Clinically, multiple involved sites at presentation (lymph nodes, spleen, skin, bone marrow, and peripheral blood) and during the 9-year follow-up (testis) were detected, and the disease was associated with a relative indolent course like other low-grade lymphomas. The phenotypic profile of lymphoma cells studied by immunoperoxidase method, and by single-labeling and double-labeling flow cytometric analyses (SIg+, K+, LN2+, MB1+, MB2+, HLA-DR+, CD 9+, CD19+, CD 20+, CD 21+, CD 22+, CD 24+, Leu 8+, CD 5-, CD 10-, CD 11b-, CD 11c-, CD 25-, CD 38-, PCA-1-, FMC-7-, CD 23-) was consistent with a B-cell proliferation at an intermediate stage of differentiation but distinct from other well-defined B-cell neoplasms. Whether such unique B-zone pattern was due to an intrinsic property of this lymphoma or it is to be related to the coexisting reactive T-zone expansion remains controversial.\r"

A significant percentage of our patients (35%) had areas of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma elsewhere, supporting the hypothesis that anaplastic thyroid carcinoma arises from preexisting well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-four of 30 tumors analyzed (84%) stained for keratin, 28 (93.3%) stained for vimentin, and ten (33%) stained for epithelial membrane antigen. Younger patients lived longer than older patients, and patients whose disease was earlier-stage at presentation responded better than patients with metastases at presentation. Radical surgery alone did not significantly increase survival duration over less radical surgery. The role of multimodality therapy needs further evaluation.\r"

The authors performed mucin and immunohistochemical studies on this case and on ten cases of nonseminomatous germ cell tumors containing embryonal carcinoma and endodermal sinus tumor for comparison. Mucin positivity as well as immunoreactivity for epithelial membrane and carcinoembryonic antigens were confined to metastatic adenocarcinoma in this case, whereas Ki-1 and alpha-fetoprotein immunostaining were restricted to the ten control cases of germ cell tumors. Although the majority of second malignant components found in a seminoma are other nonseminomatous germ cell components, the rare possibility exists that a second malignant component is a metastasis from elsewhere in the body.\r"

Both children are in second complete remission and off treatment after local radiation therapy and second courses of chemotherapy. Review of these two and five previously reported isolated mandibular relapses in childhood leukemia indicate that they are usually delayed until after cessation of therapy. Treatment with radiation and combination chemotherapy can result in long remission and possibly cure.\r"

  ".W": "Because of the high frequency, serious sequelae, and complex and costly management, neonatal jaundice is a good candidate for preventive treatment. In this respect the clinical problem of neonatal jaundice has many similarities with the problem of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Both conditions are transient peculiarities of newborn metabolism. Most neonates exhibit the biochemical abnormality, but a small minority is placed in jeopardy of life or suffers serious sequelae. In both conditions a loose relationship exists between the degree of biochemical abnormality and the clinical manifestations that are poorly predicted by monitoring the abnormalities. The administration of vitamin K at birth corrected the biochemical abnormalities and eliminated clinical hemorrhagic disease. The simplicity, efficacy, and safety of vitamin K prevention of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is the prototype in the search for the solution to the problem of neonatal jaundice. For most neonates, antenatal phenobarbital comes close to this prototype in terms of efficacy and simplicity. The combination of antenatal and postnatal therapy seems suitable for use in preterm labor in combination with tocolysis. This recommendation is conditional on the demonstration of safety by long-term follow-up. The competitive inhibition of HO by synthetic metalloporphyrins offers an even simpler solution, but the level of efficacy achieved with the doses and compounds used so far are not comparable with that of phenobarbital. For the time being, phenobarbital is recommended for population groups with high risk of severe neonatal jaundice, or scarcity of resources for the management of neonatal jaundice with phototherapy and exchange transfusion.\r"

  ".U": "90315754\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of heme oxygenase activity in the developing neonate is essential to the control of bilirubin production as well as intracellular heme and hemoprotein metabolism. The coordinated activity of the microsomal enzymes, heme oxygenase and NADPH-cytochrome c (P450) reductase, and the cytosolic enzyme biliverdin reductase is responsible for the degradation of heme. The complete reaction sequence requires oxygen and NADPH, and produces bilirubin and carbon monoxide in equimolar amounts. Although heme oxygenase expresses a rather broad range of substrate affinities, the oxidative degradation of heme is exclusively alpha-specific. Heme oxygenase is found in several tissues, with significant activity levels in the liver, spleen, and erythropoeitic tissue. Heme oxygenase activity is inducible by heme and other metalloporphyrins, hormones, starvation, stress, toxins, and xenobiotics. Heme oxygenase induction is generally considered to be the result of an increased protein synthesis and gene transcription. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies of the heme oxygenase gene that identified inducer element binding sites responsive to metal administration, heat shock, and nutrient availability. In the developing fetus and neonate, hepatic heme oxygenase activity and mRNA levels are elevated above that of the adult. This suggests that the elevated heme catabolism observed in neonates may be associated with an increased transcription of the heme oxygenase gene. The apparent induction of hepatic heme oxygenase during the neonatal period is probably the result of tissue-specific and time-dependent transcriptional regulating factors including potentially hormones and heme. Several metalloporphyrins, such as the tin and zinc porphyrin complexes, inhibit heme oxygenase activity and thus have therapeutic potential for the treatment of neonatal jaundice. Recent studies suggest that the meso- and bis-glycol derivatives of these metalloporphyrins may be more potent inhibitors of heme oxygenase activity in vitro and in vivo than the protoporphyrin structures. As structural analogues of heme, however, these compounds may also have other less desirable effects on the regulation of heme and hemoprotein metabolism, particularly in the developing neonate.\r"

  ".W": "The issue of what is a critical threshold of bilirubin for the neonate in terms of long-term morbidity, however, remains unanswered. The recent large prospective study carried out in the Netherlands by Van de Bor et al. to evaluate the effect of bilirubin on 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome of premature infants with a birthweight less than 1500 gm identified a consistent increase in handicap rate for each 2.9 mg/dl (50 microns mol/L) increase in maximum bilirubin concentration. The percentage of children with both minor and major handicaps increased consistently with increased bilirubin concentration. Logistic regression analysis with the maximum serum bilirubin concentration as the continuous variable and controlling for seven other risk factors identified an odds ratio for handicap of 1.3 with a 95% confidence interval between 1.03 and 1.62, (P less than 0.02). These data suggest that a relationship exists between mild and moderate levels of bilirubin and neurodevelopmental handicap at 2 years of age in premature infants. Van de Bor's study is important because it suggests that we must continue to investigate the risk of low to moderate levels of bilirubin in both premature and full-term infants. The study of neonatal alterations of behavior, BAER conduction time, and cry characteristics in infants with hyperbilirubinemia lends support to the hypothesis that low levels of bilirubin result in neonatal neurobehavioral changes that can be easily measured and recorded by these techniques. BAER changes are mediated by the eighth cranial nerve pathway, and cry characteristics are mediated by the vagal complex cranial nerves. The nuclei of these cranial nerves are located in close proximity to one another in the brainstem, and therefore the insult imposed by bilirubin is reflected not only in changes of these two parameters but by behavioral manifestations (i.e., specifically orientation). Finally, however, evidence exists that reversals of these measured changes do occur after treatment modalities such as exchange transfusion or phototherapy are used. The question of a safe level of bilirubin concentration, and safe duration of exposure relative to long-term minor or soft neurodevelopmental handicaps remains unanswered. Large, controlled, prospective, epidemiologic studies are needed to provide these answers.\r"

For the last 15 to 20 years this level has also been used to determine the need for intervention in healthy full-term infants who do not have hemolytic disease. A critical review of all the available data including six studies from the collaborative perinatal project (more than 30,000 infants) and several smaller studies of term infants without hemolysis reveals essentially no evidence of adverse effects of bilirubin on IQ, neurologic examination, or hearing. The investigation and treatment of normal infants with jaundice is expensive and potentially harmful. We need to reassess our approach to hyperbilirubinemia in healthy full-term infants.\r"

Many studies, however, summarized in this article, have shown that bilirubin is an effective lipid-soluble antioxidant in vitro, even at physiologic concentrations, vying with even vitamin E in its ability to intercept and inhibit free radical chain reactions that generate hazardous lipid peroxides. These studies suggest that bilirubin may have a biochemical function in vivo and belong to a group of low-molecular weight antioxidants that together provide protection from cellular damage by endogenous-organic free radicals. Dovetailing with the notion that bilirubin may have a protective function is the recent discovery that heme oxygenase, one of the enzymes responsible for bilirubin formation, is a heat-shock protein, one of a group of proteins that are thought to protect organisms from oxidative and other forms of biochemical stress. Thus, the biochemical path from red to green to yellow may defend as well as degrade, and modest levels of the end product may possibly be physiologically beneficial.\r"

In term infants with hyperbilirubinemia, three distinct clinical phases are apparent in the first weeks of life, and long-term consequences include extrapyramidal disturbances (particularly athetosis), hearing loss, gaze abnormalities (particularly limitation of upward gaze), and, in a minority, intellectual deficits. In term infants with moderate hyperbilirubinemia, minor delay in motor development during the first year has been demonstrated, but with longer follow-up this delay is not apparent. Associated conditions such as sepsis, anoxia, and acidosis may increase the likelihood of neurotoxicity of bilirubin in these infants. The clinical consequences of moderate hyperbilirubinemia in premature infants are unclear. No acute clinical syndrome is recognizable during the first weeks. The results of follow-up studies are variable. Hearing loss is the commonest consequence. Follow-up through age 2 years in one large study suggests that static encephalopathy may be a sequel. Longer follow-up is needed to understand the clinical consequences of moderate hyperbilirubinemia in this important group of infants.\r"

These advances have led investigators to examine the correlation between cutaneous and blood bilirubin in hopes of either replacing or reducing the number of serum bilirubin values obtained. In the past other investigators attempted to do the same, using visual estimates of jaundice with and without the help of reference devices. The establishment of an acceptable correlation between cutaneous and serum bilirubin requires (1) accurate measurement of serum bilirubin, (2) accurate measurement of cutaneous bilirubin, and (3) steady-state conditions between the blood-cutaneous bilirubin \"compartments.\" The accuracy with which cutaneous bilirubin can be measured appears similar or better than that with which serum bilirubin is measured; with older transcutaneous devices significant interobserver variability may exist. Bias in the form of other skin chromogens also interferes with accuracy. Rapid changes in serum or cutaneous bilirubin concentration or nonhomogeneous distribution of cutaneous bilirubin interferes with our knowledge of cutaneous-blood bilirubin kinetics. At present transcutaneous bilirubinometry cannot replace routine serum measurements, but both new and old transcutaneous devices can serve as effective screening devices. The choice of which device to use depends on its cost-effectiveness in any given clinical setting.\r"

Left ventricular wall stress was markedly reduced by quinapril, but during the relatively short treatment period, only a nonsignificant trend toward reduction in left ventricular mass was observed.

Blood samples were drawn at baseline and at 2 hour intervals for 6 hours. Drug and metabolite levels, as well as red cell filterability (deformability), were determined on all blood samples. Statistically significant dose-response increases of red cell filterability were found 4 and 6 hours after oral medication with the dosages of 200 to 1200 mg pentoxifylline. These changes were proportional to the plasma levels of pentoxifylline and metabolites 1 and 5 of this agent. Attempts were made to develop a suitable animal-screening method for agents with similar activity and to determine whether red blood cells in the absence of disease-related abnormalities may respond to this type of therapy. Five healthy Macaca arctoides monkeys were given 24 mg/kg pentoxifylline intravenously, and measurable but lesser increases in red cell deformability were recorded than in the patients.\r"

As expected, both drugs showed striking clinical efficacy, and within a subsample of the group, earlier findings were confirmed, that dextroamphetamine but not methylphenidate lowered urinary and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and whole body norepinephrine turnover, and that urinary and plasma concentration of homovanillic acid was unaltered by either drug. Methylphenidate but not dextroamphetamine increased plasma norepinephrine.

Although the two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lowered (p less than 0.05) blood pressure with no change in heart rate during the early postdose period, captopril produced a greater (p less than 0.05) hypotensive effect than did enalapril. Enalapril caused a greater (p less than 0.01 to 0.05) ACE inhibition than did captopril during the 2- to 48-hour postdose period. Plasma renin activity increased (p less than 0.05) with the two drugs and returned toward baseline by 12 hours after administration. Plasma aldosterone levels, elevated before drug administration, were decreased by the two drugs in a stepwise fashion, but the suppressive effect was greater (p less than 0.01 or p less than 0.05) after captopril than after enalapril. Natriuresis was greater (p less than 0.05) during the first 24-hour period after enalapril than after captopril. The findings indicate that the acute pharmacodynamic responses to the two ACE inhibitors differ in patients with liver cirrhosis. However, the mechanism(s) of the divergent effects of the two drugs and the clinical implications remain obscure from this single-dose study.\r"

Scatchard plot analysis was also performed to determine the density and affinity of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. No significant difference in Bmax or Kd values was identified between adult tottering and control mice in any of the tissue preparations. The amount of radioligand binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A), non-5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopamine D2, and benzodiazepine receptors was also identical in tottering and control mice.

Ketamine, phencyclidine, and MK-801, which are noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of Glu receptor (but do not antagonize kainic acid receptors) were tested in the present study for their effects on behavioral and/or electrographic seizures and seizure-related brain damage induced by kainic acid. Behavioral seizure activity was reduced by these agents, as was spread of electrographic seizures to neocortex, but seizures recorded from deep brain regions such as hippocampus, piriform cortex, and amygdala were not significantly diminished. All three agents prevented seizure-related brain damage in the amygdala, piriform cortex, thalamus, and CA1 region of the hippocampus but conferred little or no protection in the lateral septum and CA3 region of the hippocampus. The regional selectivity of the neuroprotective effect suggests that NMDA receptors may play a more dominant role in seizure-related brain damage in some brain regions than in others. The ability of NMDA antagonists to prevent seizure-related damage in several brain regions without suppressing seizure activity suggests that in these brain regions persistent seizure activity can be maintained by other transmitter systems, with or without NMDA receptor participation, but that seizure-related brain damage is critically dependent on NMDA receptor participation.\r"

A third group (n = 19), who had poorly controlled epilepsy but no significant psychological disturbance received one type of psychological treatment after a stable baseline. The treatments were educational and were designed to improve coping skills. Weekly seizure frequency was monitored for 42 weeks, and self-rating measures of anxiety and depression were obtained before treatment and at the end of follow-up. All three groups showed a significant reduction in seizure frequency that was maintained at 6-month follow-up. The two groups with psychological symptoms showed a significant improvement in scores on the self-rating scales. We concluded that routine use of psychological intervention may be helpful in outpatient management of epilepsy.\r"

Seventy eight patients (56.9%) were in shock at the time of randomisation to the trial. The age, sex, number of patients in shock, haemoglobin value at the time of entry to the trial, number of patients with severe medical illness, location of bleeders, and stigmata of recent haemorrhage were comparable among the heat probe, pure alcohol, and control groups. The initial haemostatic effect of the heat probe was better than that of the pure alcohol injection (44 of 45 v 31 of 46, p = 0.0004). The ultimate haemostasis achieved by the heat probe group (41 of 45) was better than that of the pure alcohol group (31 of 46, p = 0.012) and of controls (24 of 46, p = 0.0001). The duration of hospital stay was shorter for patients in the heat probe group than for the control group (6.2 days v 13.8 days, p less than 0.05). The incidence of emergency surgery was less for the heat probe than the control group (three of 45 v 12 of 46, p = 0.027). The mortality rate was less in the heat probe than in the control group (one of 45 v seven of 46, p = 0.031). We suggest that heat probe thermocoagulation should be the first treatment of choice for arrest of massive peptic ulcer haemorrhage.\r"

The healing rates were similar with 4 g sucralfate suspension per day and 300 mg ranitidine per day (82% and 88% after 12 weeks, respectively). Of the 109 patients with healed ulcers, 92 were entered into the maintenance trial and treated with sucralfate tablets (2 g per day) or placebo tablets. Maintenance treatment with sucralfate delayed symptoms of gastric ulcer recurrence. Lifetable analysis showed significant differences between sucralfate and placebo, both after six months (p = 0.018) and after 12 months (p = 0.044). The rates of symptom recurrences were 13% and 34% after six months and 34% and 55% after 12 months for sucralfate and placebo, respectively. The rate of asymptomatic recurrences after 12 months was similar in the two groups (9% and 10%, respectively). The recurrence rate was higher in patients who had never taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs than in those who had but had stopped on admission to the study. It was also higher in patients with recurrent ulcer and in those with scarring deformation and narrowing of the pylorus. Maintenance treatment with sucralfate slowed the appearance of symptom recurrences of gastric ulcer.\r"

Application of the signal-averaged ECG in many other types of patients is currently being studied. The use of this diagnostic tool is rapidly increasing.

Expiration was stopped at the instant that the next inspiration would have been delivered. At this moment, when the pressures in the lung and the ventilator circuit had equilibrated, the level of auto-PEEP was systematically measured. Of 57 patients undergoing controlled mechanical ventilation, 27 (47%) had 1 to 6 cm H2O of auto-PEEP. The incidence of auto-PEEP increased significantly when the minute ventilation exceeded 18.4 L/min, the respiratory rate was higher than 27 breaths/min, or the set PEEP was greater than or equal to 10 cm H2O. Therefore, auto-PEEP is the result of several ventilator-related factors. Because auto-PEEP occurred in 47% of the patients in the study, routine monitoring for auto-PEEP in patients receiving controlled ventilation is recommended. Further studies of auto-PEEP and its clinical impact are warranted.\r"

A maximum inverse ratio of 3:1 was established to achieve a PaO2 of 105 mm Hg and PaCO2 of 37 mm Hg. In this case, the mean airway pressure rose from 32 cm H2O with assist-control ventilation to 39 cm H2O with PcIRV at 3:1.

A group of polypeptide growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, and basic fibroblast growth factor, have been found to promote or hasten healing in animal models. This technology is now moving into the clinical arena where its potential for human healing must be evaluated.\r"

The number of patients with AIDS treated in intensive care units, on the other hand, has been decreasing progressively, perhaps as a result of a mortality rate close to 90%. However, because recent data demonstrate (1) a lower mortality rate in patients with AIDS who receive mechanical ventilation and (2) the ability to reverse the wasting syndrome in selected groups, we propose a reassessment of the criteria for intensive care unit admission of patients with AIDS.\r"

Strategies to enhance information to families, such as written information, daily contact with physician or nurse or both, and establishing a nurse contact person for families and a family contact person who can be called about changes in patient status, are presented. Recommendations for future research include the study of elderly and male family members and tests of interventions aimed at meeting families' needs.\r"

Results for Duplex scanning were better in the proximal and middle segment compared to the distal third of the superficial femoral artery. The sensitivity of segmental lower extremity pressures and pulse volume recordings for predicting proximal superficial femoral artery disease compared to arteriography was 82%; specificity was 79% and accuracy 80%, all inferior to that of Duplex scanning. Duplex scanning is a promising technique suitable for noninvasive assessment of patients presenting with suspected superficial femoral artery disease. It should readily identify candidates for percutaneous interventional techniques in which a patent segment of proximal superficial femoral artery is required for access. It will also be useful in follow-up studies of patency of the superficial femoral artery following interventional procedures such as balloon dilatation and laser angioplasty.\r"

Three female rhesus monkeys (13-16 yr of age) were treated continuously for 10 months with 25 micrograms/day GnRH agonist using osmotic minipumps. All three animals exhibited normal menstrual cycles before treatment. Within 5 weeks of the beginning of GnRH agonist treatment, serum progesterone and estradiol concentrations had fallen to low values and did not rise significantly during the remaining treatment period. The decline in ovarian steroidogenesis was correlated with a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD; bone mineral content/bone width) of the caudal vertebrae and humerus. The reduction of BMD of the caudal vertebrae occurred gradually. The downward trend was evident during the first 3 treatment months, but did not fall significantly below pretreatment levels until 9 months of GnRN agonist treatment. The overall decline in BMD for the caudal vertebrae was approximately 14% after 9 months of GnRH agonist treatment. The measured decline in BMD of the humorous was 11%. Serum osteocalcin levels rose more than 10-fold above pretreatment values between 4 and 7 months of GnRH agonist treatment before declining to levels that approached pretreatment concentrations between 8 and 10 months of treatment. Menstrual cycles were reinitiated within 4 weeks after the termination of treatment, as shown by luteal phase increases in serum progesterone concentrations. BMD of the humerus and caudal vertebrae remained subnormal 2 months posttreatment, but by 5 months had recovered to near-pretreatment values. These data suggest that ovarian hormone deprivation induced by GnRH agonist administration is associated with a decline in BMD in female monkeys, and that this animal model may be an excellent model for postmenopausal bone loss or bone reduction resulting from medical oophorectomy. The GnRH agonist-treated monkey also has the potential to be developed as a model for type I postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

The same variables were studied in 42 premenopausal women with endometriosis treated for 6 months with nafarelin acetate (a LHRH agonist) given alone in a dose of 200 or 400 micrograms or in a dose of 400 micrograms combined with 1.2 mg norethisterone (NET)/day and followed-up for a further 6 months. No changes were seen in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D], vitamin D-binding protein, or the free index of 1,25-(OH)2D during the natural menopause. A small increase was found in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD] and 24,25-(OH)2D3 after correction for seasonal variation. All three nafarelin groups had a significantly decreased free index of 1,25-(OH)2D, which returned to the baseline value on withdrawal of the treatment. Serum 25OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D3 were increased at 6 months and thereafter decreased to baseline values. These changes were still visible after correction for seasonal variation. Vitamin D-binding protein showed a small transient increase in the nafarelin plus NET group, but was unchanged in the other two groups. The 24-h urinary excretion of calcium increased significantly in the groups receiving nafarelin alone, whereas it remained unchanged in the nafarelin plus NET group. We conclude that detectable changes in 1,25-(OH)2D do not occur in natural menopause. Treatment with LHRH agonists produces a significant decrease in serum 1,25-(OH)2D, which does not seem to be dependent on increased bone resorption. This suggests that LHRH agonists may induce a change in other pituitary hormones involved in vitamin D regulation.\r"

Here we provide final evidence that this is indeed the case by sequence analysis of both the 22K and 25K forms. Furthermore, the 25K form is shown to be glycosylated, while the 22K form is not. Both size variants of placental GH are, thus, likely to reflect the partial glycosylation of a unique peptidic chain.\r"

Previously, two classes of mutations have been identified: 1) those that impair posttranslational processing of proinsulin to insulin, and 2) those that alter the structure of the insulin molecule, thereby reducing the affinity of the molecule for the insulin receptor. We have investigated two apparently unrelated patients, both of which have mutations that inhibit the conversion of proinsulin to insulin. By directly sequencing genomic DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction, we have demonstrated that both patients are heterozygous for the same point mutation converting codon 65 from an arginine (CGT) to a histidine (CAT) codon. Because Arg65 is one of the two dibasic amino acids at the site of proteolytic cleavage between the insulin A-chain and C-peptide, this mutation explains the impairment in the cleavage of proinsulin to insulin. Interestingly, the same His65 mutation has been identified in the insulin gene of a Japanese kindred with familial hyperproinsulinemia. Thus, this mutation has occurred in three apparently unrelated kindreds from two different racial groups. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the dinucleotide sequence CpG, the first two nucleotides in the arginine (CGT) codon, is a \"hot spot\" for mutations.\r"

Thirty minutes after insulin injection plasma glucose levels were markedly decreased; concomitantly, plasma epinephrine levels had increased about 10-fold; plasma norepinephrine levels, however, increased only moderately. Lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density and the cAMP response to 10 mumol/L isoproterenol stimulation were elevated; lymphocyte Ts/c-cells had increased, whereas Th-cells had decreased, resulting in a decrease in the Th-/Ts/c-cell ratio from 1.7 to 1.0. These changes were accompanied by a significantly reduced lymphocyte proliferative response (measured as [3H]thymidine uptake) to mitogen stimulation. Two hours after insulin injection plasma catecholamines, lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor function, lymphocyte subset distribution, and proliferative responses had returned to nearly preinsulin levels. We conclude that acute vigorous increases in endogenous epinephrine evoked by insulin-induced hypoglycemia are associated with increases in lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor function, redistribution of lymphocyte subsets, and an (at least transiently) attenuated in vitro immune responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are anabolic effectors in many tissues and cultured cells, including astrocytes and neurons. Receptors for insulin and IGFs are found throughout the human brain. We examined the level of insulin and IGF receptors on membranes prepared from surgical specimens of tumor (astrocytomas and glioblastomas) and normal human brain. Specific binding (per 100 micrograms membrane protein) of insulin was less than 5% in all normal and tumor samples. Specific binding of IGF-I to 12 normal brain specimens ranged from 1-8%. IGF-I binding to 18 glioma specimens ranged from 2-25%. Scatchard analyses of IGF-I binding confirmed increased IGF-I-binding sites in some glial tumors vs. normal brain, but detected no difference in affinity characteristics. Cross-linking of [125I]IGF-I demonstrated that glioma tissue expressed the same lower mol wt (approximately 118 kDa) alpha-subunit as the normal brain confirming the neural origin of the cells expressing the IGF-I receptor. IGF-binding proteins (approximately 40 kDa) were also found in the membranes of some of the glioma but none of the normal brain specimens. In cell lines derived from glioma specimens, IGF binding was readily detectable (4-10% specific binding), but insulin binding was barely detectable (0-03%) in every line examined. The size of the IGF-I alpha-subunit in the cultured cells was larger (approximately 133 kDa) than that in the original tissue. Most glioma cell lines exhibited an IGF-I dose-dependent stimulation of thymidine incorporation into DNA, and partially purified IGF-I receptors from these cells exhibited a dose-dependent stimulation of the autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit. We conclude that human glioma cells have functional IGF-I receptors and suggest a role for this receptor in glioma cell growth.\r"

We screened 54 thyroid tumors (36 benign and 18 malignant) for gene rearrangements of the protooncogenes c-myc, c-myb, c-fos, c-erb-B1, c-erb-B2, c-erb-A, N-ras, K-ras, and H-ras. Only mutations of H-ras were observed. None of the 15 colloid adenomas examined had detectable H-ras rearrangements. Of the remaining tumors, we observed mutations of H-ras in 4 benign and 4 malignant neoplasms. Gene amplification was found in 5 tumors. An aggressive recurrent papillary carcinoma had a marked amplification of one of the H-ras alleles. The amplified allele was truncated, in that the 3' variable tandem repeat was not a part of the amplification unit, and contained a codon 12 point mutation leading to a valine for glycine substitution. We also observed the association of low copy gene amplification with a codon 12 valine for glycine mutation in a follicular adenoma. Two tumors contained H-ras EcoRI polymorphisms not present in the DNA of normal thyroid from the same individuals, and one follicular carcinoma showed loss of an H-ras allele. Ras protooncogenes may become transforming by quantitative mutations, leading to increased expression, or qualitative mechanisms, through activating point mutations. Both of these appear to coexist in thyroid neoplasms, and it may be that a combination of both mechanisms is capable of inducing a more complete spectrum of neoplastic phenotypes.\r"

  ".W": "Renin, angiotensin-II, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) have been found in the hypothalamus and pituitary in rats, and renin, angiotensinogen, and ACE have been found in human pituitary lactotrophs. To determine the physiological relevance of the renin-angiotensin system in the pituitary hormone response to stress in humans, we created significant inhibition of ACE by administering a clinically used dose (10 mg) of enalapril (E) 4 h before measuring the stress hormone responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Eight fasting lean healthy males (aged 20-35 yr) were given either placebo (P) or E (10 mg, orally) in two studies separated by at least 5 days in a blinded study design. Glucose, ACTH, cortisol, PRL, and GH levels were measured before E or P and at 20-min intervals beginning 20 min before insulin administration. ACE levels were similar at baseline (E, 21.6 +/- 2.7; P, 22.4 +/- 2.4 mU/mL/min), but were significantly lower at the time of insulin injection with E treatment (E, 2.9 +/- 0.5; P, 20.9 +/- 2.5 mU/mL/min; P less than 0.001). The mean of the total area under the curve of PRL secretion was significantly lower for the E group (E, 3767.2 +/- 710.7; P, 4554.9 +/- 650.1 micrograms/L.min; P less than 0.05). Although the mean peak PRL levels were lower for the E group, this did not reach statistical significance (E, 53.0 +/- 9.7; P, 64.4 +/- 9.4 micrograms/L; 0.05 less than P less than 0.10). These differences in PRL responses appeared to be due primarily to substantial decreases in PRL responses with E in three of the eight subjects. No significant differences were found with ACTH, cortisol, or GH for basal levels, peak levels, or areas under the curve.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile and circadian patterns of PRL release were studied in 11 insulin-dependent diabetic men by sampling blood every 10 min for 24 h and comparing the results to those obtained in 12 normal nondiabetic men. The diabetic men had a mean (+/- SE) 24-h serum PRL concentration of 5.5 +/- 0.42 micrograms/L, which was significantly lower than that in the nondiabetic men (9.3 +/- 0.86; P = 0.0008). Quantitative Cluster analysis of pulsatile PRL time series revealed a normal pulse frequency, but decreased maximal peak amplitude (6.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 11.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms/L; P = 0.0009), peak increment (2.6 +/- 0.24 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L; P = 0.009), peak area (126 +/- 15 vs. 192 +/- 19 micrograms/L.min; P = 0.03), and interpulse valley mean concentration (4.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.6 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L; P = 0.0007). PRL pulse incremental amplitude correlated significantly (r2 = 0.577; P = 0.007) and negatively with duration of disease. Fourier analysis disclosed a normal circadian rhythm of PRL release in diabetic men, with a mean circadian amplitude of 1.5 micrograms/L +/- 0.31, which peaked at 0201 h +/- 89 min (+/- SE). In summary, we have demonstrated significantly reduced mean 24-h serum PRL concentrations in men with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The concomitant suppression of spontaneous PRL pulse amplitude, peak increment, and interpulse valley mean concentrations in the presence of normal pulse frequency is consistent with a reduced mass of PRL secreted per burst and/or accelerated metabolic clearance of PRL in men with type I diabetes mellitus.\r"

The skin specimen from an 11-year-old girl contained predominantly Leu-4+ and Leu-9+ lymphoid cells. No T cell receptor gene rearrangements were found in the skin or in an involved lymph node. The variations in clinical, histologic, and immunopathologic features suggest that mycosis fungoides in young patients represents a heterogeneous subgroup of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\r"

Several of these case reports involved subjects with various photodermatoses, implicating enhanced sensitivity of the patient's skin to both light and chemicals. Despite the widespread use of sunscreens, the small number of published reports of contact and photocontact sensitization to these agents suggests that either such sensitization is less than commonly perceived or is underreported. Establishment of a registry for reporting adverse effects associated with sunscreening agents would help to characterize the incidence of sensitization.\r"

  ".W": "This review presents a classification scheme for disorders of the mononuclear phagocyte and dendritic cell systems. Previous classifications, based primarily on cytomorphology, are now obsolete. Electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and, especially, immunocytochemistry have revealed the histiocyte identified by hematoxylin-and-eosin staining to be not one but several cell types. Currently, two broad groups of histiocytic cells are recognized, the monocyte-macrophage group and the dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are further subclassified as Langerhans cells, indeterminate cells, interdigitating cells, and dermal dendrocytes. Many disorders of the skin and other organs are characterized by proliferation of \"histiocytic\"-appearing cells. Some of these diseases clearly behave in a malignant fashion, whereas others follow a benign or variable course. At present, the proliferating cell type has been identified in only a few of these disorders by ultramicroscopy and cytochemical and immunocytochemical methods. Nevertheless, the pieces of the puzzle are beginning to fall into place. In general, those disorders that typically behave in a malignant fashion have been more extensively studied. The benign histiocytic disorders of children and adults are a heterogeneous group of diseases. Currently, some of these disorders are unclassified or classified with uncertainty. For example, how should severe histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy be classified? There is a proliferation of nonlymphoid mononuclear cells that are positive for S-100 protein and negative for CD1 and that exhibit lymphophagocytosis. Is this then a mononuclear phagocytic or dendritic cell disorder? Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a disorder of macrophages. Self-healing reticulohistiocytosis and solitary Langerhans cell histiocytoma are benign proliferative disorders of Langerhans cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
