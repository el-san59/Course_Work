The results indicate that the gamma promoter is required for proper initiation of transcription. However, the accumulation of gamma globin transcripts in response to hemin induction requires the additional presence of either gamma intervening sequence 2 or the 3' enhancer element of the beta globin gene. Thus, the gamma promoter may provide the elements for developmental stage-specific gene expression during fetal life. By contrast, the beta 3' enhancer is erythroid-specific but not developmental stage- or gene-specific.\r"

  ".W": "We report two different disorders of the beta-globin gene cluster segregating in a Belgian family: a novel deletion that results in G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thalassemia (thal) and a heterocellular hereditary persistence of foetal hemoglobin of the Swiss type linked to a delta degree-thal gene (delta degree-HPFH). Heterozygosity for the heterocellular HPFH brings about a moderate (3.4% to 8.24%) increase of hemoglobin (Hb) F having a G gamma/A gamma ratio of 4:1, whereas carriers of the G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal deletion show in their peripheral blood a considerably higher (15%) percentage of Hb F. Both defects interact in the compound heterozygotes for G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal and delta zero-HPFH producing a further increase (up to 24%) of fetal Hb consisting entirely of G gamma chains. Molecular characterization of the G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal by means of Southern analysis showed that the deletion spans about 50 kb, removing the 3' end of the A gamma-gene, the psi beta-, delta-, and beta-genes. A number of possible mechanisms leading to the overproduction of Hb F in HPFH and G gamma + (A gamma delta beta)zero-thal will be discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We studied 24 recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) or allogeneic BMT (BMT) to determine whether impaired erythropoietin (Epo) response to anemia could delay full erythropoietic recovery. Observed Epo levels were compared with predicted levels based on the relationship between Epo and hematocrit in 125 control subjects. Circulating Epo levels were normal during conditioning and the early posttransplant period. Between days 21 and 180, Epo levels remained normal in ABMT patients but were inappropriately low for the degree of anemia in BMT patients. Median time to full erythropoietic engraftment was longer in BMT than in ABMT recipients. Circulating Epo returned to appropriate levels after day 180, except in patients with active cytomegalovirus infection. We conclude that impaired Epo response to anemia can contribute to delayed erythropoietic recovery after allogenic BMT. Renal toxicity of ciclosporin, interaction between host and donor marrow, and cytomegalovirus infection might play a role. This study could support the use of recombinant human Epo to accelerate erythropoietic engraftment after BMT.\r"

  ".W": "We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect residual leukemia-specific mRNA in blood and marrow from 37 patients in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our two-step PCR method involved the use of \"nested primers\" in the second step and could detect one K562 cell diluted into 10(5) normal cells. Elaborate measures were taken to exclude false-positive and false-negative results. In nine patients whose blood and marrow were studied simultaneously the results were concordant (two positive and seven negative). Twenty-three patients transplanted in chronic phase (CP) with unmanipulated donor marrow were studied. Blood cells from nine of these patients were studied 3 to 6 months post-BMT and six were PCR positive; three were negative on subsequent studies. Blood cells from 18 patients studied between 8 months and 8 years post-BMT were all PCR negative. Nine patients transplanted in CP with T-cell-depleted marrow cells were studied. Blood from five was positive 3 to 24 months post-BMT; blood from five was negative 3 to 6 years post-BMT. Four patients no longer in first CP were studied after BMT with unmanipulated donor marrow. Blood from all four was positive 5 to 19 months post-BMT. Based on the known clinical results of transplant in these three cohorts we conclude that PCR may be positive within 6 months of BMT in patients who can expect long-lasting remission, whereas PCR positivity later after BMT may indicate that the probability of cure is reduced. Thus, the technique may prove useful for early assessment of new transplant protocols that might inadvertently increase the risk of relapse.\r"

  ".W": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is a powerful new tool for amplifying target DNA, thus allowing for sensitive detection of specific nucleic acid sequences. One important potential use of PCR involves screening the donated blood supply for transfusion-transmitted viruses. Realization of this goal has been limited by (1) the requirement for multiple, discrete PCR reactions to amplify and detect target sequences of more than one virus, and (2) the lack of a rapid, nonhazardous means for specific detection of one or more PCR-amplified products. We report the simultaneous amplification of three distinct target sequences without discernable loss in sensitivity toward any single target sequence. We also demonstrate very rapid separation and detection of PCR-amplified viral DNA through the use of automated capillary DNA chromatography. Amplified DNA peaks were initially identified by scanning the capillary effluent at ultraviolet wavelengths, while discrimination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemic virus type I PCR-amplified DNA was accomplished through use of virus-specific, fluorescently labeled primers and probes. These results indicate progress toward an automated system for screening the blood supply for nucleic acid sequences of multiple pathogens.\r"

Two populations of MP were arbitrarily delineated by light scatter as larger or smaller than 0.5 micron fluorescent beads. An estimate of MP concentration was obtained by adding a known amount of fluorescent beads to each sample before analysis of a set number of counts on the flow cytometer. The addition of platelet activation inhibitors (prostaglandin E-1, theophylline, and aprotinin) to the anticoagulant during preparation of PC combined with a reduction in surface area of the storage container caused approximately a 40% reduction in the number of MP appearing during storage relative to donor-matched controls. In addition, the inhibited concentrates had 84% less platelet factor 3 (PF3) activity in the supernatant and 61% less released lactic dehydrogenase. A reduction in surface area of the container in the controls partially offset these differences. A significant correlation was found (rs = .748) between PF3 levels and the concentration of larger MP. The inhibitors did not reduce the small number of MP found in stored platelet-poor plasma. Surface antigen analysis showed that the majority of MP in PC were platelet-derived; most were positive for glycoprotein (GP) IIbIIIa (73%) and/or for GPIb (43% to 46%). We conclude that procoagulant MP are released from platelets during storage as a result of platelet activation augmented by interaction of platelets with the bag wall.\r"

All recipients were followed at monthly intervals for 6 months and then bimonthly up to 1 year for evidence of HTLV-I seroconversion. Without regard to results on screening assays, pretransfusion and posttransfusion samples were tested with two licensed HTLV-1 whole-virus screening enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), recombinant EIAs for antibody against tax (p40x) and p21e envelope, standard whole virus Western blot (WB), WB enhanced with recombinant p21e, and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). In the early period posttransfusion, antibody to gag core protein was predominant with anti-p24 generally appearing before anti-p19. Recombinant anti-p21e envelope protein, in EIA and WB format, was frequently the earliest envelope reactivity detected, while anti-gp46 in WB and anti-gp61/68 in RIPA system appeared later. Anti-tax antibodies appeared later in the time course of seroconversion. The whole-virus EIAs were less sensitive than the confirmatory assays. The combination of WB and RIPA or WB enhanced with recombinant p21e appeared equally effective in confirming samples as positive by the Public Health Service two gene group confirmatory algorithm. However, specificity of this assay approach could not be addressed in this study.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of mortality in Finland during 1981-5 based on 1980 census data on 30-54 year old wage earner men and with particular attention to unemployment in the year before the census. SETTING--Research project at the University of Helsinki. SUBJECTS--All wage earner men in Finland aged 30-54 at the 1980 census. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Causes of death during 1981-5 and duration of unemployment in the year before the census. Background variables controlled for were age, socioeconomic state, marital state, and health. The data were analysed by log linear regression models. RESULTS--During the study period 1981-5, which covered almost 2.7 million person years, there were 9810 deaths. After controlling for all background variables relative total mortality among unemployed versus employed men was 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.82 to 2.05). The excess mortality was highest in accidental and violent causes of death (relative mortality 2.51; 95% confidence interval 2.28 to 2.76). For circulatory diseases the relative death rate was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.40 to 1.70), but among neoplasms only lung cancer was associated with excess mortality. Selection for unemployment based on age, socioeconomic state, and marital state was evident but no such selection was detected based on health. Effects of unemployment on mortality were more pronounced with increasing duration of unemployment. CONCLUSIONS--The relative excess mortality of unemployed men in Finland cannot fully be explained by demographic, social, and health variables preceding unemployment. Unemployment therefore seems to have an independent causal effect on male mortality. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms between unemployment and mortality.\r"

RESULTS--Overall, 206 patients (60%; 95% confidence interval 54% to 65%) were positive for HIV--in one or both assays used. The peaks for both tuberculosis and HIV infection were among men aged 25-34 years and women aged 14-24 years. Of patients with confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis, 73/149 (49%; 41% to 57%) were positive for HIV; 67/83 (81%; 70% to 89%) patients with pleural disease and 16/19 (84%; 60% to 97%) patients with pericardial disease were positive. HIV positive patients with positive sputum culture were less likely to have had a positive sputum smear, and their chest x ray films less often showed classic upper zone disease or cavitation. Of 72 patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for AIDS, 17 were negative for HIV. CONCLUSIONS--The high prevalence of HIV in patients with tuberculosis suggests that an epidemic of reactivating tuberculosis is arising in those who are infected with HIV. The redirection of public health priorities towards tuberculosis would focus on a major treatable and preventable complication of the AIDS epidemic.\r"

RESULTS--Of 98 patients approached, 84 (86%) agreed to be interviewed, of whom 70 (83%) died during the study and 59 (84%) stated a preferred place of final care: 34 (58%) wished to die at home given existing circumstances, 12 (20%) in hospital, 12 (20%) in a hospice, and one (2%) elsewhere. Their own home was the preferred place of care for 17 (94%) of the patients who died there, whereas of the 32 patients who died in hospital 22 (69%) had stated a preference to die elsewhere. Had circumstances been more favourable 67% (41) of patients would have preferred to die at home, 16% (10) in hospital, and 15% (9) in hospice.

DESIGN--The numbers of live births and stillbirths were collected monthly returns from the maternity units concerned. Deaths of infants aged less than or equal to 1 week were collected in the same returns. The intended place of delivery was confirmed at the monthly perinatal mortality meeting, during which maternal and fetal factors were discussed. SETTING--A rural health district of 400,000 population where one third of all deliveries occurred in seven isolated general practitioner maternity units, 8% in the integrated general practitioner unit, and the remainder in the consultant unit. SUBJECTS--All babies of women whose deliveries were booked in the district before the onset of labour or the diagnosis of intrauterine death, excluding twins, babies with lethal congenital malformations, and those less than 2500 g. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome of all deliveries and parity of mothers. RESULTS--14,415 Deliveries were analysed. The perinatal mortality rate was 2.8/1000 births in the consultant unit (7950 deliveries), 4.8 in the isolated general practitioner units (5237 deliveries), and zero in the integrated general practitioner unit (1228 deliveries). Perinatal deaths attributable to asphyxia were more common in the isolated general practitioner units (1.5 per 1000) than the consultant unit (0.6 per 1000). The perinatal mortality rate among babies born to nulliparous women was 3.2/1000 births in the consultant unit and 5.7 in the isolated general practitioner units; for those born to multigravid women it was 2.4 and 4.2 respectively. CONCLUSIONS--The outcome of delivery was not influenced by parity. Both antenatal and intrapartum care were responsible for the higher perinatal mortality rate in the isolated general practitioner units. The integrated unit, which shared midwifery staff with the consultant unit, seemed to work well. Analysis by intended place of delivery at the time of onset of labour or diagnosis of intrauterine death suggested that the care given in isolated units needs to be improved, perhaps by better training of general practitioners and consultant supervision of antenatal care.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To examine how functional disability varies with sex, age, and other variables in patients aged 75 and over living in the community and to ascertain whether a statistical model derived from the variables in this population usefully predicted functional disability in another of similar age. DESIGN--Retrospective study of data collected by interview and by examination of medical records. SETTING--An urban general practice with five partners and a list of 15,000 patients, very few of whom belonged to ethnic minorities. PATIENTS--775 Patients (252 men, 523 women) aged 75 and over living in the community between September 1985 and August 1986; 13 other patients considered to be unsuitable and 14 who declined an interview were excluded. Also 94 patients who became 75 or joined the practice after August 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The proportions of fit, partially disabled, and severely disabled (housebound) patients. RESULTS--90 Men (35.7%) and 128 women (24.5%) were fit, and 27 men (10.7%) and 116 women (22.2%) were housebound; in all age groups women were significantly more likely to be disabled than men. A significant trend towards greater disability was shown with increasing age and, more noticeably, with pattern of consultation when patients were divided into three categories based on the number of times they had attended the surgery and been visited at home over about two years. Statistical models gave the forecast percentage of fit and severely disabled patients for each sex, age group, and pattern of consultation, and a simple scheme was derived to identify from information wholly contained in medical records most of those patients most prone to severe disability. The scheme was verified applying it to a population of 94 elderly patients in 1988-9. CONCLUSION--Sex, age, and pattern of consultation together provide a quick indication of elderly patients' tendency to severe disability, which can help in screening and in day to day consultations.\r"

It shows wider class differences during the years of working life than those found when mortality is expressed in terms of standardised mortality ratios. Examination of the change in class differences between 1971 and 1981 for all causes of death combined and for the three categories of death which during these ages make a major contribution to total years of potential life lost shows complex changes. Inequalities in years of potential life lost have increased between 1971 and 1981, during which all the principal causes of death have shown stationary or rising rates among the manual classes. The use of years of potential life lost as a measure of population health trends focuses attention on the major contribution of violent death, which occurs mainly in younger men, to widening class differences in mortality.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective cohort study based on data collected in the multiphasic health examinations by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland from 1966 to 1972 and follow up until 1982. SETTING--34 Communities throughout Finland. SUBJECTS--12,053 Women and 19,076 men who were employed and aged 25-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mortality and work disability pensions from all and specified causes. RESULTS--Body mass index was a weak predictor of death but a strong predictor of early work disability, which increased linearly with body mass index. After adjustment for age, geographical region, occupation, and smoking the relative risks of work disability for women and men with a body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 were, respectively, 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.3) and 1.5 (1.3 to 1.7) when compared with those of subjects with body mass index less than 22.5 kg/m2. The increased risks were due to an excess of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases but not of mental diseases. One fourth of all disability pensions from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal causes in women and half as many in men could be attributed to overweight (body mass index greater than 25 kg/m2) alone. CONCLUSIONS--Though modest overweight has little impact on mortality it predicts severe functional impairment. A considerable proportion of work disability pensions could probably be prevented by efficient weight control.\r"

DESIGN--Two year follow up of subjects randomised, double blind, to receive either active (control group) or placebo (intermittent group) depot neuroleptic medication. Both groups received brief courses of oral neuroleptic when prodromal symptoms or relapse occurred. SETTING--Psychiatric outpatient department, Charing Cross Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--54 Stable patients in remission who met the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia on the basis of case notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival without relapse, survival without hospitalisation, point prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, structured assessment of social functioning (social adjustment scale II), and frequency of prodromal symptoms. RESULTS--Of 19 relapses recorded over two years, 10 (53%) were preceded by non-psychotic prodromal signs. Survival rates for both relapse and hospitalisation were worse with intermittent treatment than continuous treatment over the two year follow up: 92% of controls and only 54% of patients given intermittent treatment survived the two year period without hospitalisation. Prolonged or frequent relapses as well as episodes of prodromal symptoms were more frequent with intermittent treatment. Lower scores for extrapyramidal side effects were recorded in the intermittent treatment group, but periodic assessments of social functioning failed to show any social advantages from this. CONCLUSION--The findings are at variance with a previous report of one year follow up in this cohort and attest to the superiority of continuous depot neuroleptic prophylaxis in preventing both psychotic and neurotic or dysphoric morbidity in schizophrenia.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective six year follow up of infants with bacteriuria on screening in an unselected infant population. SETTING--Paediatric outpatient clinic. PATIENTS--50 Infants (14 girls, 36 boys) with bacteriuria on screening verified by suprapubic aspiration from an unselected population of 3581 infants in a defined area of Gothenburg. INTERVENTIONS--Children with asymptomatic bacteriuria and normal findings on initial urography were untreated, although other infections were treated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Culture of urine and determination of C reactive protein concentration every six weeks for the first six months after diagnosis, every three months from six months to two years, and every six months between two and three years; thereafter yearly urine culture. Evaluation of renal concentrating capacity with a desmopressin test; radiological examination, including first and follow up urography and micturition cystourethrography without antibiotic cover; and measurement of renal parenchymal thickness and renal surface area. RESULTS--Of the original 50 infants, 37 (12 girls, 25 boys) were followed up for at least six years. Two infants developed pyelonephritis within two weeks after bacteriuria was diagnosed; the others remained free of symptoms. 45 Infants were untreated; the bacteriuria cleared spontaneously in 36 and in response to antibiotics given for infections in the respiratory tract in eight. Recurrences of bacteriuria were observed in 10 of the 50 children, of whom one had pyelonephritis. No child had more than one recurrence. At follow up urography in 36 of the 50 children (9 girls, 27 boys) after a median of 32 months no child had developed renal damage. First samples tested for renal concentrating capacity showed significantly higher values than those from a reference population (mean SD score 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.79; p less than 0.001), but the last samples showed no significant difference (mean SD score 0.08, -0.24 to 0.40; p greater than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--Mass screening for bacteriuria in infancy results primarily in detection of innocent bacteriuric episodes and is not recommended.\r"

DESIGN--A joint formulary development group produced draft guidelines based on an earlier hospital formulary, which were sent to interested local general practitioners for consultation. Revised guidelines were then drawn up and forwarded to the health board's medicines committee for approval and distribution. SETTING--Grampian Health Board. SUBJECTS--Nine members of joint formulary development group plus local general practitioners who were invited to comment on a list of 11 ulcer healing drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Degree of coincidence of drugs selected by hospital doctors and general practitioners. RESULTS--The ulcer healing drugs selected by the panel of general practitioners and by hospital doctors were highly coincident. The cost of one day's treatment with drugs varied considerably between hospital and general practice--for example, one drug cost 46p in hospital and 1 pounds in general practice and another cost 1.26 pounds in hospital and 1.01 pounds in general practice. Overall, six drugs cost more in hospital and five cost more in general practice. CONCLUSIONS--A joint formulary for use in hospitals and general practice in a health board can be devised fairly simply by consultation as virtually the same drugs are used in both types of practice. It should influence the health board's expenditure on drugs and affect the choice of drugs when a patient is discharged from hospital or is referred to any hospital in the region.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the prevalence of symptoms and signs of acute mountain sickness of the Swiss Alps. DESIGN--A study using an interview and clinical examination in a representative population of mountaineers. Positive symptoms and signs were assigned scores to quantify the severity of acute mountain sickness. SETTING--Four huts in the Swiss Alps at 2850 m, 3050 m, 3650 m, and 4559 m. SUBJECTS--466 Climbers, mostly recreational: 47 at 2850 m, 128 at 3050 m, 82 at 3650, and 209 at 4559 m. RESULTS--In all, 117 of the subjects were entirely free of symptoms and clinical signs of acute mountain sickness; 191 had one or two symptoms and signs; and 158 had more than two. Those with more than two symptoms and signs were defined as suffering from acute mountain sickness. At 4559 m 11 climbers presented with high altitude pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema, or both. Men and women were equally affected. The prevalence of acute mountain sickness correlated with altitude: it was 9% at 2850 m, 13% at 3050 m, 34% at 3650 m, and 53% at 4559 m. The most frequent symptoms and signs were insomnia, headache, peripheral oedema, and scanty pulmonary rales. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales were associated with other symptoms and signs and therefore characteristic of acute mountain sickness. CONCLUSION--Acute mountain sickness is not an uncommon disease at moderately high altitude--that is, above 2800 m. Severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, tachypnoea, and pronounced pulmonary rales indicate severe acute mountain sickness, and subjects who suffer these should immediately descend to lower altitudes.\r"

Different cytokines may exhibit opposing biological effects on a specific target cell or in a particular disease. Autoantibodies to cytokines may block cytokine effects in vivo or may function as carriers to deliver cytokines to tissues. Soluble receptors of cytokines, particularly for IL-2 and TNF alpha, may be released by cell activation. Lastly, a specific receptor antagonist of IL-1, IL-1ra, is synthesized by human monocytes and macrophages, particularly under the influence of GM-CSF. IL-1ra is the first described naturally-occurring receptor antagonist of any cytokine or hormone-like molecule. It is not yet known whether IL-1ra is produced in tissues in human diseases as an endogenous anti-inflammatory factor. Whether any of these potential mechanisms to regulate cytokine effects will be of value in the treatment of human diseases remains to be determined.\r"

The primary procedures included were in situ EPL (n = 54), push-bang (44), retrograde ureteroscopy (40), Dormia basket extraction (6), push-pull (1), antegrade ureteroscopy (1) and combinations of these (7). The success of the primary procedure could not be predicted from stone size, site or duration in the ureter, but upper tract dilatation was significantly less (p less than 0.01) in the successful group. The overall success rate for complete stone extraction was 97%, but 54 patients (35%) required more than 1 procedure to achieve this. In situ EPL and push-bang, as either primary or secondary procedures, were successful in treating 79 patients (52%); 2 patients required ureterolithotomy (1.3%). The overall complication rate was 18%. Since EPL is only successful in treating approximately half of ureteric calculi, a range of other treatments should be available to maintain a low rate of open surgery.\r"

Age, sex, grade and stage had no effect on the number of bladder recurrences, but ureteric tumours had significantly more recurrences than renal pelvicaliceal tumours. Sex, bladder recurrences and site of primary tumours did not influence survival. Thus grade and stage of the primary tumour were the only predictive variables of the final outcome.\r"

The prognostic relevance of the clinical features of age, duration of symptoms, frequency, nocturia, pain and bladder capacity was assessed. The study showed no statistical correlation between the severity of histological findings at diagnosis and the eventual outcome of the disease. Over 50% of patients with severe histological abnormalities responded to conservative treatment. Although the majority of patients with mild pathological changes responded to conservative treatment, some did require surgical intervention. The clinical features of pain, nocturia and bladder capacity showed significant differences between the 2 patient groups. However, the former 2 features are subject to many variables and the latter probably has too wide a range to be useful as a prognostic indicator. Only the response of patients to conservative treatment will indicate those who are not being helped and who may eventually require surgical treatment.\r"

This difference was apparent regardless of whether the bladder contained a tumour. It was concluded that bladder washings provide superior material for flow cytometric DNA analysis and that flow cytometric DNA analysis of freshly voided urine may have deficiencies which preclude its use in routine clinical practice.\r"

After a median time of 41 months, 62 patients were alive; 51 had died from recurrent bladder cancer and 19 from intercurrent disease without recurrence of their malignancy. Distant metastases developed in 40 patients, accompanied in 5 cases by local recurrence. Local recurrence was the first sign of relapse in 11 patients. In 3 patients the localisation of the relapse remained unknown. The corrected 5-year survival rate was 60%. T category and a palpable bladder tumour were independent pre-treatment prognostic factors in a Cox regression analysis, together with the interval between initial diagnosis and cystectomy. The presence of a palpable tumour before the start of treatment was associated with a particularly poor prognosis in T3/T4a tumours, whereas the survival of patients with non-palpable T3/T4a tumours was similar to that of patients with T2 bladder cancer. Another important prognostic factor was post-irradiation stage reduction (no residual muscle infiltration in the cystectomy specimen). Significantly more patients with non-palpable bladder tumours experienced post-radiation stage reduction than did those with a palpable tumour. However, the prognostic value of stage reduction was statistically significant only in patients with palpable bladder tumours.\r"

A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.\r"

The present study was designed to investigate a possible association between catheter-induced inflammation and activation of another mediator of inflammation, the contact system. We also investigated various in vitro conditions to optimise biocompatibility studies. Our data indicate that both the complement and the kallikrein-kinin system are activated by potentially harmful silicone/latex catheters and may be involved in the pathophysiology of catheter-induced urethral strictures. In vitro biocompatibility tests may be performed at both 20 and 37 degrees C. Glass test tubes may be used for in vitro complement but not for kallikrein-kinin investigations.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of physician probability estimates calculated on the basis of findings from history-taking and physical examination in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia in elderly patients. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Two community hospitals offering secondary and tertiary care. PATIENTS: A total of 259 patients over 65 years of age found to have previously undiagnosed anemia. MEASURES: Physician estimates of the likelihood of iron deficiency before (pretest probability) and after (post-test probability) the laboratory test results were available. The hemogram was available to the physicians when they made their pretest probability estimates. Because the serum ferritin level proved to be the most powerful of the laboratory test results studied, the likelihood ratios associated with the post-test estimates were compared with the ratios associated with the serum ferritin level. MAIN RESULTS: The post-test probability estimates were influenced by the serum ferritin level and the pretest estimates. The post-test estimates derived from the findings obtained through history-taking and physical examination and the laboratory test results (including the serum ferritin level) were slightly less accurate in predicting iron deficiency than the serum ferritin level alone. Nevertheless, a model in which the pretest estimates were used in addition to the serum ferritin level to predict iron deficiency proved to be more powerful than the serum ferritin level alone (p = 0.006). This indicated that the limitations of the post-test estimates were due to a misinterpretation of the serum ferritin level and that the findings from history-taking and physical examination added important diagnostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians must be aware of test properties to provide optimal care to their patients. If test results are properly interpreted, pretest probabilities derived from findings obtained through history-taking and physical examination can add useful information that will lead to more accurate diagnoses.\r"

SETTING: Infertility clinic. PATIENTS: Thirty-five women with normal intrauterine pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: Serial measurement of the serum hCG level and the diameter of the gestational sac through transvaginal ultrasonography. MAIN RESULTS: The gestational sac could not be visualized when the hCG level was less than 1100 IU/L. The average growth rate of the sac was 0.9 mm/d. The threshold values for sac diameter, serum hCG level and gestational age below which the yolk sac was not visible were 3.7 mm, 1900 IU/L and 36 days respectively; the corresponding values above which the yolk sac was always visible were 6.7 mm, 5800 IU/L and 40 days. The threshold values below which cardiac activity was not visible were 8.3 mm, 9200 IU/L and 41 days respectively, and the corresponding values above which cardiac activity was always visible were 14.0 mm, 24,000 IU/L and 46 days. The mean gestational ages and the 95% confidence and prediction intervals were tabulated so that measurement of the gestational sac diameter could be used to estimate gestational age early in normal pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Transvaginal ultrasonography enables detection of an intrauterine sac and reliable estimation of gestational age on the basis of sac dimensions before an embryo can be seen.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the quality of abstracts of original research articles. DESIGN: Blind, criterion-based survey. SAMPLE: Systematic sample of 33 abstracts of original research articles published in CMAJ in 1989. MEASUREMENT: The quality of abstracts was measured against a checklist of evaluation criteria, which were divided into eight categories. A score for each abstract was obtained by dividing the number of criteria present by the number applicable. The overall mean score was also determined. RESULTS: The overall mean score of abstract quality was 0.63 (standard deviation 0.13) out of 1. Of the abstracts reporting study design 56% did not include specific technical descriptors. About 52% did not explicitly describe the study variables. In describing subject selection 79% failed to use specific technical terms. Of the abstracts reporting results 66% did not provide appropriate supporting data. Of those that gave conclusions 86% did not address study limitations and 93% made no recommendations for future study. CONCLUSION: Most of the abstracts provided some information pertaining to each evaluation criterion but did not provide detail sufficient to enhance the reader's understanding of the article. On the basis of the study sample the abstracts need improvement in description of research design, reporting of subject selection and results, and statements of limitations and recommendations. The small sample from one journal and the absence of comparison between the contents of the abstracts and the contents of the articles were limitations. Future studies should address these issues and compare the quality of traditional and structured abstracts.\r"

This study used an animal tumour model system to compare the ability of 6 independent observers of varying experience to detect and stage superficially transplanted growths. A preclinical medical student was as good as a Consultant ENT Surgeon in predicting the presence of tumour but the ability to stage tumours accurately was related to experience. Whilst the most experienced observers accurately estimated the size of tumours less than 2 cm, they were less accurate for larger (greater than 2 cm) tumours which were constantly understaged. This phenomenon may have important clinical implications particularly related to current nodal staging criteria.\r"

  ".W": "A middle ear effusion has been shown, in KEMAR, to increase the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal by 6 dB SPL. It has also been shown that the hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion is related to the volume of middle ear fluid. Therefore, it was hypothesized that measurement of the height of the resonant peak of the external auditory canal could be used as a method of assessing the magnitude of any hearing impairment due to otitis media with effusion. 182 ears from 182 children aged 3-12 (mean 6.3) years were studied. Pure-tone audiometry and impedance tympanometry were performed, and the acoustics of the external auditory canal were measured using the Rastronics CC1-10 frequency response analyser. The mean height of the resonant peak (17.9 dB SPL) of children with a type A tympanogram was significantly different from the mean value (23.6 dB SPL) of those with a type B tympanogram. There was a significant correlation between the height of the resonant peak and the speech frequency average of the pure-tone thresholds. The sensitivity and specificity of using the height of the resonant peak to detect hearing impairments in different age groups were calculated and compared with the sensitivity and specificity of tympanometry. The test did not provide the same degree of sensitivity as tympanometry but was more specific. The additional advantages of the test are that it is quick, taking less than 1 min per ear, and is well tolerated by children in whom there was a 99% compliance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Frequent stoma cleaning (more than 5 times a day) was required by 37% of the patients. Significant correlation was found between respiratory symptoms, voice rehabilitation and several aspects of daily living, including fatigue, sleep problems, social contacts and psychological distress. These findings indicate that respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy are both frequent and troublesome.

The nasal resistance was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) on the side of the affected ear in patients with unilateral chronic otitis media before decongestion, but following decongestion the difference was not significant. Nasal obstruction is a significant determinant in unilateral chronic otitis media and although septal displacement may be the underlying cause, the major component of the obstruction appears to be due to an associated mucosal oedema.\r"

Controls were healthy patients or patients with cancer of another site or another histological type (147 men). Past occupational exposures of cases and controls were compared. The analysis was performed independently for each site of cancer, controlling for age, amount and type of alcohol and tobacco consumption, and state of dentition. Results showed that cancer of the supraglottis was associated with exposure to oil and grease (odds ratio = 2.4; 95% confidence interval 1.0-5.8), and with exposure to cement (odds ratio = 4.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-16.4). Cancer of the glottis was also associated with exposure to dye (odds ratio = 6.4; 95% confidence interval = 0.7-56.6). Exposure to flour occurred more frequently among controls than among patients with pharyngeal or oral cancer. This might reflect an association between this occupational exposure and some particular types of cancer included in the control group.\r"

The patients were divided into four operative groups and the results analysed accordingly. Improvement in SNA was noted in 80-96% of patients and PNIF improved in 60-83%. However, PNIF decreased in 17-40% of patients who felt they were improved. Statistical analysis using Spearman's Rank Correlation test showed no correlation between SNA and PNIF.

Specific clinical questions can be answered using in-vivo investigations. 99mTcO-4/123I scintigraphy is used to evaluate thyrotoxicosis and solitary thyroid nodules. 99mTc/201T1 subtraction scanning is of value in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas and 99mTcO-4 is particularly useful in assessing salivary and lachrymal gland function and drainage. 99mTc-MDP bone scanning is useful in the evaluation of osteomyelitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, bone graft viability and some facial fractures. The role of radioisotopes in the management of differentiated and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is now well established. Although there are many other agents available to image head and neck cancer, few can actually achieve the required diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies into routine imaging has been hampered by distinct practical problems and the search is now on for more sensitive non-specific diagnostic agents. It is now possible to evaluate new 99mTc labelled tumour-imaging agents using animal tumour model systems and the use of radioactivity in all aspects of otolaryngological research adds an extra quantitive dimension. Together with SPECT, and the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) to image the physiology of normal tissues and tumours, the use of radionuclide investigations can lead only to an increase in ENT diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and, subsequently, to an overall improvement in the way we diagnose, stage and treat head and neck cancer.\r"

The poorest results and highest rate of pseudarthrosis occurred in patients with double-level fusions. Pseudarthrosis occurred in four of six patients with double-level fusions and unsatisfactory clinical results occurred in five of six patients with double-level fusions. Advantages of the microscopic technique are better examination of the surgical site, less blood loss, and less surgical dissection than other surgical salvage techniques. This procedure should be reserved for single-level pathology in the lumbosacral spine.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate a socket mechanism responsible for controlling the kinematics in the statically positioned glenohumeral joint, a suprascapular nerve block was performed in 13 selected patients, with recurrent anterior instability and defects of the labrum. Kinematics were then documented by roentgenograms in four positions within the horizontal motion plane. Combined paralysis of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles resulted in abnormal anterior translation in only two of 47 roentgenograms. Normal ball-and-socket kinematics were retained in the remaining 45 roentgenograms. The consistent arthroscopic findings were an undamaged glenoid articular surface with a detached or absent labrum. The injury to the labrum reduced the depth of the socket by one-half. The other one-half of the socket provided by the contour of the glenoid remained intact. A balanced muscle envelope was not required to maintain normal kinematics in selected, actively positioned, unstable shoulders. The retained glenoid depth was sufficient to produce the observed ball-and-socket kinematics. Further in vivo study of shoulder kinematics will be needed to clarify the interactive roles of the socket and muscle envelope in maintaining glenohumeral stability during the more demanding stresses during active shoulder motion.\r"

In this paper, four cases are described of the development of superior migration of the humeral head following a debridement and bural decompression. In all four patients attempts were made to repair the rotator cuff. In each case the repair failed and the humeral head migrated. Two of the patients had the humeral head replaced because of a fracture; in these patients the prosthesis displaced upwards. This serious complication may follow debridement and release of the subacromial bursa when rotator cuff repair cannot be achieved. In the correction of superior humeral migration, reestablishment of the roof of the bursa was carried out in two cases. This procedure appears effective and may be considered in the future for such cases.\r"

The view also provides an excellent perspective for roentgenographic examination of os acromiale. It is reproducible and relatively easy to obtain. The acromion is but one component of the subacromial arch, but this view is a valuable additional diagnostic tool to be used in evaluating the sometimes perplexing problem of impingement syndrome.\r"

Excellent anatomic reduction near 91% of the sound wrist as well as satisfactory functional results around 90.5% of the sound wrist were gained during the 24-month follow-up period. Forearm muscles exert compression forces on distal radial metaphyseal fractures throughout the healing period. Any procedure or device that cannot provide constant counterforce to the action of forearm muscles during fracture healing will result in the loss of anatomic reduction. Adequate distraction counter-force was provided by an external fixation device that was superior to other conventional methods because of its simple application, low rate of complications, and excellent anatomic and functional results.\r"

The average intercondylar distance was 16.1 mm in Group 1, 18.1 mm in Group 2, and 20.4 mm in Group 3. All differences were highly significant. The intercondylar notch was wider in the posterior part and had no crossing bony ridges but had generally concave walls, which provided a functional shelf for the ACL to insert on the lateral side. Significant osteophyte formation and stenosis of the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch occur early in the ACL-deficient knee. A narrow anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch without osteophytes was also found in knees with an acute ACL rupture. At reconstruction of the ACL, notchplasty should be performed concomitantly.\r"

In all three clinical situations, hospitalization time was shortened, and high local and low systemic levels of antibiotic were obtained.

  ".W": "Periprosthetic macrophages were isolated from the synovium of primary and revision arthroplasty patients. Inflammatory activity was determined by the level of superoxide (O2-) production de novo and in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation. Nonstimulated primary arthroplasty-derived macrophages produced 2.54 +/- 2.04 pmoles of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. When identical reaction tubes were stimulated with PMA, O2- levels increased to 5.76 +/- 3.77 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. Nonstimulated revision arthroplasty-derived macrophages produced 3.26 +/- 2.02 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells during this ten-minute time period. When identical reaction tubes were stimulated with PMA, O2- levels increased to 3.98 +/- 2.52 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. The difference in the ratio of O2- production in response to stimulation between primary and revision groups was statistically significant. The observation of a chronic moderate level of activation and the lack of responsiveness to a potent stimulator suggests that macrophage inflammatory activity is down-regulated in periprosthetic synovium.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed that small crystals were formed around the hypertrophic chondrocytes, especially in the degenerated matrix containing electron-dense granular materials and cellular debris. Chondrocytes of this kind were never observed in the articular tissue from ten patients who had osteoarthrosis. These hypertrophic chondrocytes with several unique immunohistochemical characteristics may initiate the formation of CPPD crystals.\r"

Implantation was of a press-fit, smooth implant (eight dogs) or a titanium alloy beaded device (ten dogs). Animals were studied at six, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Roentgenographic and histologic analysis was performed for all implants. All animals were ambulatory. Roentgenographically, smooth implants showed progressive radiolucencies with increasing trabecular sclerosis under the implants. These changes were less prominent under the porous implants. Histologically, fibrous interfaces were identified focally under all implants but were thicker under smooth devices. Eighteen- and 24-week specimens showed substantial ingrowth into the porous pegs but minimal ingrowth into the porous plateau. Concurrent histologic and biochemical evaluation in dogs demonstrates the possible fate of implants in knee arthroplasty in human beings. As has been observed, histologic analyses suggest that clinically satisfactory results do not constitute evidence of stabilization by bone ingrowth.\r"

  ".W": "Bone volume is determined by the relative rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent research in several laboratories suggests that growth factors may act locally to modulate bone formation by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and activity. A number of bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and characterized from bone matrix extracts and from media conditioned by bone cells and bone organs in culture. The growth factors found in bone matrix include insulinlike growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Conditioned medium from bone cells contains several of these growth factors and also hematopoietic factors. These bone matrix-derived growth factors have different biologic activities, including mitogenic, differentiating, chemotactic, and osteolytic activities. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce substantial quantities of growth factors for extracellular storage in bone matrix. Apart from being produced for extracellular storage, it is possible that growth factors secreted by bone cells have acute effects on their neighboring osteoblastic cells, i.e., paracrine action, or on themselves, i.e., autocrine action. The release of matrix-stored growth factors by bone resorption may mean that growth factors act as delayed paracrine agents, e.g., osteoblasts deposit growth factors in bone and later when these growth factors are released from bone via bone resorption, the growth factors stimulate osteoblast precursors to proliferate. The findings that bone is a storehouse for growth factors and that bone cells in culture produce and respond to bone growth factors suggest bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. This review is focused on the structure, regulation, and biologic actions of the known bone growth factors.\r"

In this study, micromotion was visually observed at the implant-bone interface of cemented and uncemented implants. Six dogs had staged bilateral implantation. Biomechanical analysis of three- and 12-month specimens was correlated with histologic analysis of the same specimen. Load transmission involved compression of trabecular bone and fibrous tissue at the interface. Failure of the interface occurred through cyclic fatigue and microfracture of trabeculae. Micromotion was seen at all interfaces, porous or smooth, cemented or uncemented. Displacement was greatest under an eccentrically loaded plateau. Micromotion at ingrown and cemented interfaces was because of trabecular compression. Uncemented smooth devices and uncemented porous devices with fibrous fixation of the plateau appeared unstable. The cemented implants and a single uncemented implant studied at 12 months showed no interface micromovement. The absence of micromovement in the uncemented implant was associated with subsidence and with ingrowth of 30% into the porous peg and porous plateau.\r"

Guinea pigs were sensitized with an acetone extract of the sweater material, by means of the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT). Active ingredients were then separated from the extract, by step-by-step patch test screening of chromatographic fractions in the guinea pigs, and finally analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although there were 2 allergens with important activity (1 in the fraction eluted from the silica gel column with hexane, and 1 in the methanol fraction), the present study is focussed on the fat-soluble allergens in the hexane fraction. GC-MS analysis revealed that 4 kinds of phosgene (chlorophenyl)hydrazones (PCPHs) were present in the hexane fraction. PCPHs prepared in our laboratory showed strong eliciting activities, not only in the guinea pigs sensitized with the extract, but also in a male volunteer sensitized by exposure to a yellow sweater during irritancy testing. Phosgene (2,5-dichlorophenyl)hydrazone, which was the main component among the PCPHs found in the sweater, sensitized guinea pigs even at the 1 ppm level. From these results, we conclude that PCPHs were one of the allergens responsible for the cases.\r"

Irritant threshold levels were defined histologically for each of the substances. CuSO4 was found to be non-irritant at all concentrations. The addition of non-irritant concentrations of SLS lowered the threshold levels for HgCl2 and SnCl2, but CuSO4/SLS was non-irritant at all concentrations tested. Preapplication to the mucosa of SLS at non-irritant concentrations gave results with HgCl2, SnCl2 and CuSO4 similar to those with SLS added to the metal salt solutions.

Those subjects (1385) considering themselves to have had hand eczema within the previous 12 months were invited to a dermatological examination. It was found that a history of childhood eczema was the most important predictive factor for hand eczema. Second was female sex, followed by occupational exposure, a history of asthma and/or hay fever, and a service occupation. A small decrease in risk with advancing age was also found. The difference in the probability of having had eczema in a 1-year period, between individuals having the most important risk factors studied and those having none of them, proved to be for females 48% compared to 8%, and for males 34% compared to 4%. A history of childhood eczema was found to be more common among young persons, indicating an increase in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis. Of those individuals who reported childhood eczema, 27% reported hand eczema on some occasion during the last 12 months.\r"

Thus, topical mercurials are still in use, even though more effective and less toxic drugs are now available. We report 2 cases of severe allergic reaction to ammoniated mercury and hope, in agreement with the pertinent literature, to contribute to its removal, and that of most other mercurials, from the therapeutic armamentarium.\r"

Methyl hexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA, an epoxy hardener) caused 1 case of contact urticaria. Previously relevant occupational allergic contact dermatitis from DGEBA-ERs was detected in 5 cases. On patch testing, ERC allergens gave the following positive reactions: epoxy resin of the standard series in 35 cases (4.0% of 870 tested), epoxy reactive diluents in 10 (7.1% of 140), cycloaliphatic epoxy resins in 4 (11.1% of 36), epoxy acrylates in 4 (4.5% of 88), and amine compounds commonly used as epoxy hardeners in 17.

This was the result of an exclusive increase in rectosigmoid transit time from 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 9.8 +/- 2.1 hours (P less than 0.001). No variations were found in right or left colon transit time. Distal colonic motility is thus a crucial factor in the genesis of diarrhea in chronic alcoholic subjects.\r"

Serum electrolyte concentrations, daily urinary volume, and daily losses of sodium, potassium, and chloride were measured in all patients. Daily fecal weight and daily losses of sodium and potassium were analyzed in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. Serum chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy or in nonoperated patients. Daily urinary loss of sodium in nonoperated patients was significantly higher than in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (P less than 0.01) or conventional ileostomy (P less than 0.05). Daily urinary loss of chloride in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than in nonoperated patients. Daily fecal loss of potassium in patients with ileoanal anastomosis was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than in those with conventional ileostomy. Daily urinary volume and fecal weight did not differ significantly in patients with ileoanal anastomosis or conventional ileostomy. The present study indicates that changes in water and sodium balance after ileoanal anastomosis are similar to those after conventional ileostomy but chloride balance is more altered after ileoanal anastomosis.\r"

We hypothesized that adaptive increases of circulating and tissue levels of the gut hormones peptide YY (PYY) and enteroglucagon may contribute to this improvement by slowing small bowel transit and increasing small bowel absorption. The specific aim of this study was to measure plasma and ileal mucosal concentrations of PYY and enteroglucagon in dogs 1 year after proctocolectomy and ileal reservoir-anal anastomosis. In the ileal reservoir dogs, postprandial PYY levels reached 238 +/- 31 pmol/liter compared with 93 +/- 33 pmol/liter in sham operated controls (P less than 0.001). Postprandial plasma enteroglucagon levels reached 199 +/- 53 pmol/liter in reservoir animals and 52 +/- 4 pmol/liter in controls (P less than 0.05). Tissue levels of PYY in the mucosa of the ileal reservoirs were 419 +/- 43 pmol/g compared with 133 +/- 23 pmol/g in normal terminal ileum (P less than 0.0001). Enteroglucagon levels were also elevated in reservoir mucosa (193 +/- 21 pmol/g vs. 113 +/- 9 pmol/g in controls, P less than 0.05). These data demonstrate that postprandial and tissue levels of PYY and enteroglucagon increase in dogs 1 year after construction of ileal reservoirs. The adaptive increase in PYY would slow small bowel transit and the increase in enteroglucagon would promote mucosal growth, each contributing to the improved functional results.\r"

Samples were taken at diagnosis, before treatment, and during follow-up; 353 samples were analyzed. The positive threshold was taken as 2 ng/ml. At diagnosis, the sensitivity of the marker was 44 percent and its specificity 92 percent. In our series, the pretherapeutic level of SCC does not correlate with T as in Papillons' Clinical Staging System, but it does correlate with nodal invasion (P less than 0.05). It is of no prognostic value at the time of diagnosis. During follow-up, at relapse the level of SCC is 20.3 +/- 43 ng/ml. This increase is significant (P less than 0.01): the sensitivity of the marker is 77 percent. In patients who have relapsed, development of the illness correlates with the level of SCC, which is of prognostic value (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the level of SCC should be associated with the clinical follow-up of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal.\r"

This specific complication, which has been termed \"mini-perforation,\" is generally detected within 6-24 hours of polypectomy, and is characterized by local pain and tenderness, without signs of diffuse or spreading peritoneal irritation. Free intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal air on x-ray documents the actual perforation. Complete resolution of symptoms within 24-48 hours confirms the diagnosis of \"mini-perforation.\" Success depends on good bowel preparation for colonoscopy, and early recognition of perforation, with institution of bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics. The \"mini-perforation\" spontaneously closes, probably by omental adherence. Frequent serial clinical examinations are mandatory so that frank perforation with advancing peritonitis will be promptly recognized and treated surgically. An understanding of the three levels of cautery injury to the colon wall--\"serosal burn,\" \"mini-perforation,\" and \"frank perforation\" are essential in managing the complications of colonoscopic polypectomy.\r"

In six patients with constipation, three also had symptoms of obstructed defecation and one patient was incontinent due to stercoral diarrhea. One patient was only fecal incontinent and one patient had obstructed defecation as the only symptom. Three patients had no anorectal symptoms. Anal manometry in the women compared with a control group revealed significant lower anal resting and squeeze pressures, although no significant difference of rectal sensation to distention with air was found. Pudendal nerve terminal latencies were obtained in seven patients and were all normal. In four patients latency could not be demonstrated due to poor contraction of the sphincter on stimulation of the pudendal nerve. Two of these patients were incontinent and two had both constipation and obstructed defecation. It is concluded that patients with voiding symptoms due to multiple sclerosis often reveal anorectal symptoms or motility disorders. Although anal sphincter function is reduced, fecal incontinence is not prevalent in this group. The reason for this lies probably in the fact that many of the patients are constipated, thus securing fecal continence.\r"

We tested the ability of anti-tumor X anti-lymphocyte (CD3) heteroconjugates to redirect human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to lyse human colon cancer cells in cytotoxicity assays and in a murine colon tumor model. We demonstrated in vitro, that cultured human PBLs alone produced low levels of tumor lysis, but PBLs treated with anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates produced significantly greater tumor cell lysis (P less than 0.0025). Similarly, nude mice injected with LS174T human colon cancer cells and treated with cultured human PBLs and anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates survived significantly longer than saline control mice (P less than 0.01), or mice treated with PBLs alone (P less than 0.01), or heteroconjugates alone (P less than 0.05). F(ab')2 heteroconjugates were equally as effective in prolonging animal survival, but irrelevant heteroconjugates and monoclonal anti-tumor antibodies showed no therapeutic benefit. Anti-tumor X anti-CD3 heteroconjugates may represent an effective approach to tumor-specific cellular immunotherapy.\r"

A median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-54 months) has shown no recurrence of perineal disease or associated abdominal incisional hernia. There were no perioperative deaths. We propose that the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap is indicated if large amounts of perineal skin has to be sacrificed. When less skin is removed a repair with greater omentum or rectus muscle alone is adequate. The abdominoperineal approach together with filling the residual pelvic cavity with well-vascularized tissue allows definitive treatment to be carried out in one stage.\r"

The wound infection rate was 11 percent in the 143 patients completing follow-up and receiving a single dose, and 13 percent in the 128 patients receiving two doses of Timentin (P greater than 0.05). The rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. Multivariate analysis of the factors likely to affect postoperative would infection rate demonstrated an association with the type of hospital, public or private, wound infection rate 16 and 6 percent, respectively (P less than 0.01), and the surgeon group defined by the number of patients contributed greater than 25 or less than 25, wound infection rate 6 and 18 percent, respectively (P less than 0.05). We concluded that a single dose of intravenous Timentin was as effective as two doses for prophylaxis against surgical infection and that the surgeon group and the hospital in which the operation took place were statistically significant predictors of postoperative wound infection.\r"

  ".W": "The nature of anal sinus and anal intramuscular glands is well known, but their origin is still discussed. In the past years a surprising new theory about the invagination of the proctodeum into the hindgut was put forward. Evidence supporting this theory would be the existence of an \"anorectal band\" and \"epithelial debris\" in the subanoderm formed during total or partial obliteration of the anal sinuses. To characterize these histological structures, the authors examined 62 autopsy specimens with conventional and special immunohistologic staining methods. In none of the examined specimens could the structures mentioned above be detected. Nearly 90 percent of our specimens contained the well known anal sinuses. In fetuses, neonatal deaths, and children, more than one-half of the anal sinuses were accompanied by anal intramuscular glands penetrating the internal anal sphincter, whereas in adult specimens the anal intramuscular glands were rare. Eight postoperative, idiopathic chronic anal fissures and three postoperative anal fistulas examined with the same staining procedures showed epithelial cells at the base of the fissures or fistulas in two cases (25 percent) and three cases (100 percent), respectively. The results reinforce the theory that anal sinuses and anal intramuscular glands are separate anatomic entities and indicate a new theory of anal development. For idiopathic, chronic anal diseases anal sinuses have little surgical significance. Anal intramuscular glands should be the anatomic correlate of anal fistulas.\r"

  ".W": "Four patients with intestinal adenocarcinoma complicating Crohn's disease are reported. The youngest of the four patients was a 21-year-old female with a 9-year history of Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum as well as of the entire colon. She developed mucus-producing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the cecum. Of the remaining three patients with Crohn's disease, one presented an adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon, one in the rectum and the remaining one in the duodenum. All three colorectal adenocarcinomas originated in areas of high-grade dysplasia and all four in areas with chronic transmural inflammation. The review of the literature indicates that a total of 174 small and large bowel cancers occurring in Crohn's disease have been recorded (including the four reported herein). The vast majority of the reported cases have been found in the North American subcontinent. Only in a few instances were bowel adenocarcinoma and Crohn's disease observed in the European continent. It is therefore remarkable that three of our four cases were seen within a period of 12 months. Interestingly, six patients having colorectal adenocarcinoma in association with Crohn's disease were recently reported from a single hospital in England. The question therefore arises whether our cases and those reported recently from England are unrelated and merely coincidental or whether carcinomas are now also affecting European CD patients. If the latter is the case, the surveillance policy for patients with CD should be reconsidered at this hospital.\r"

The etiology of the 27 fistulas studied are as follows: cryptoglandular infection in 18, IBD in 7 (Crohn's 6, CUC 1), iatrogenic in 1, and foreign body perforation in 1. Twenty-six fistulograms revealed either direct communication with the anus or rectum, or abscess cavities/tracts, or both. Two fistulograms revealed no radiographic evidence of fistula (one patient had two fistulograms). In 13 of the 27 patients (48 percent) information obtained from the fistulograms revealed either unexpected pathology (n = 7) or directly altered surgical management (n = 6). We conclude that anal fistulography in properly selected patients may add useful information for the definitive management of fistula-in-ano.\r"

Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis has protean clinical manifestations, and symptoms are often nonspecific. Any patient with HIV infection who has unexplained GI symptoms should undergo evaluation for possible histoplasmosis. Aggressive long-term amphotericin B therapy has been effective in HIV patients with histoplasmosis. Resection or diversion of symptomatic colonic strictures caused by histoplasmosis may be necessary in addition to medical therapy.\r"

In an outpatient setting, 61 women and 36 men with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified/eligible gastroenterologists who also systematically rated the presence or absence of the six Manning criteria. Irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for the entry complaints. This determination was made by two other board-certified gastroenterologists after patients had been in the study for 9 months. These raters were independent of the study and rated the transcripts of patients' clinic visits, all other available clinical data from this and other clinics, all laboratory data obtained during the 9-month study period, and the results of a 9-month telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the study population had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome for this study. A similar proportion and type of organic disease and irritable bowel syndrome were experienced by men and women. For the total sample of 97 subjects, the correlation of the Manning criteria with irritable bowel syndrome was 0.22 (P less than 0.01). In the 61 women, correlation between the Manning criteria and irritable bowel syndrome was significant (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01). In the 36 men, however, the correlation was in the opposite direction, although it was not significant (r = -0.16). It was concluded that significant gender differences exist when using the Manning criteria for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and that the Manning criteria were not of diagnostic value in men.\r"

Subjects were divided into three groups: (a) volunteers with maximal phrenic ampullary length less than 2 cm (controls); (b) patients or volunteers with maximal ampullary/hiatal hernia length greater than or equal to 2 cm that reduced between swallows (reducing-hernia group); and (c) patients with hernias that did not reduce between swallows. Complete esophageal emptying without retrograde flow was achieved in 86% of test swallows in the controls, 66% in the reducing-hernia group, and 32% in the nonreducing-hernia group (P less than 0.05). Impaired emptying in the reducing-hernia group was attributable to \"late retrograde flow,\" whereby barium squirted retrograde from the hernia during emptying. Impaired emptying in the nonreducing-hernia group was attributable to \"early retrograde flow\" that occurred immediately after LES relaxation. The nonreducing-hernia group also had longer acid clearance times than the controls (P less than 0.05). We conclude that gastroesophageal junction competence is severely impaired in patients with nonreducing hiatal hernias, suggesting a mechanism whereby this subgroup of hiatal hernia is involved in the pathogenesis of reflux disease.\r"

The serosal solution was buffered with either HCO3- or N-2-hydroxymethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES). Luminal pH was decreased from 7.2 to 1.5 and changed back to 7.2. In stimulated (forskolin-treated) tissues, intracellular pH decreased at luminal pH 1.5 only in HEPES, with complete recovery at 7.2. In resting (omeprazole-treated) tissues, intracellular pH began to decrease at luminal pH 2.0 in HEPES and at 1.5 in HCO3-, with complete recovery at 7.2 in both. In resting tissues bathed in Cl(-)-free HEPES, the recovery of intracellular pH at luminal pH 7.2 was completely prevented by serosal amiloride (1 mmol/L) but was not affected by serosal 4,4'-diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene-2-2'-disulfonic acid (H2-DIDS; 0.5 mmol/L). In resting tissues bathed in Cl(-)-free HCO3-, the recovery of intracellular pH at luminal pH 7.2 was not affected by amiloride but was prevented partially by H2-DIDS and completely by combination of H2-DIDS and amiloride or by removal of ambient Na+. These results suggest that during exposure to high luminal [H+]: (a) stimulated oxynticopeptic cells maintain a steady intracellular pH more readily than resting cells; (b) serosal HCO3- protects oxynticopeptic cells from intracellular acidosis; and (c) both Na+/H+ exchange and Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport are involved in the recovery from intracellular acidosis in resting oxynticopeptic cells.\r"

The present study demonstrates that the increase in leukotriene C4 formation begins within 30 seconds and is maximal within 5 minutes, closely paralleled by the appearance of hemorrhagic lesions. Leukotriene C4 formation returns to prechallenge levels within 3 hours, although erosions still persist. Intragastric 0.2N NaOH, acidified 100 mmol/L taurocholate, 25% NaCl, or 0.6N HCl did not consistently increase leukotriene C4 formation despite severe mucosal injury. A number of sulfhydryl-containing or sulfhydryl-blocking agents as well as metals protected against mucosal damage and simultaneously prevented the stimulation of leukotriene C4 formation induced by ethanol. None of the agents increased and some virtually abolished mucosal formation of prostaglandin E2, indicating that gastroprotection can occur completely independently of the endogenous prostaglandin system. The leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886 markedly suppressed gastric leukotriene C4 formation but did not protect against damage caused by ethanol, NaOH, NaCl, or acidified taurocholate. Oral indomethacin reduced the ex vivo formation of both prostaglandin E2 and, to a lesser extent, leukotriene C4 in the gastric mucosa, inducing a shift in the balance from protective prostaglandins to proulcerogenic leukotriene C4. Pretreatment with MK-886, however, did not significantly diminish indomethacin-induced lesions. These data suggest that leukotriene C4 is not the exclusive mediator of gastric injury caused by necrotizing agents or indomethacin. On the other hand, certain protective compounds exhibit a striking parallelism between protection and inhibition of ethanol-induced leukotriene C4 formation, suggesting that they may affect a target crucial for both mucosal injury and stimulation of 5-lipoxygenase.\r"

G. Illing, Gross Umstadt, Germany) and anterograde (Dil; Molecular Probes) fluorescent neural tracers in rats with various selective vagotomies. Animals with only one or both gastric branch(es) spared had normal, large gastric acid responses to electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral cervical vagus and showed an abundance of Dil-labeled vagal fibers and terminals in the gastric myenteric plexus. Rats with only the unpaired hepatic branch spared had a much smaller but significant gastric acid response and a few labeled vagal profiles in the antral region of the stomach. In contrast, rats with only one or both celiac branch(es) intact had neither a gastric acid response, nor evidence for Dil transport to the stomach. Retrograde transport of True Blue through the spared vagal axons to the brainstem indicated that the cell bodies of the preganglionics that send their axons through the acid-positive gastric and hepatic branches occupy the medial longitudinal columnar subnuclei of the dorsal motor nucleus. It is concluded that besides the long-recognized gastric branches, which are the major access route to the parietal cells, the hepatic branch contains a small number of fibers that most likely reach the antrum through the right gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature and/or the right gastric artery.\r"

There was 63% shunting of 9-micron microspheres in the antrum, but none in the body. Corrosion cast and Indian ink studies showed that in the body there was a single microvascular network of capillaries that appeared to originate from the arterioles in the submucosa and were in close apposition to the epithelial cells of the gastric glands. The diameter of these capillaries was 8.6 +/- 0.2 microns. In contrast, there were two distinct capillary networks in the antrum: a basal and a superficial. The capillaries of the basal network of the antrum originated from the arterioles at the level of the muscularis mucosa and drained into the capillaries of the superficial mucosa. The capillaries of the superficial network had a significantly larger diameter (10.8 +/- 0.4 microns) than those of the basal network (7.3 +/- 0.2 microns). In many instances the capillaries of the superficial network originated directly from the ascending arterioles passing through the basal network. These direct arteriocapillary connections may have permitted the shunting of 9-microns spheres in the antrum.\r"

  ".U": "91130757\r", 
  ".W": "Electrical conductance as a sensitive indicator of acid damage has been investigated in guinea pig duodenal mucosa using Ussing-chamber techniques. Reductions of luminal pH from 7.4 to 3.0, 2.3, or 2.0 caused concentration-dependent, progressive increases in conductance, accompanied (pH 2.0) by a continuous increase in hydrogen permeation as determined by pH-stat titration. Increases in conductance and hydrogen flux were related to base-line conductance, with higher values conditioning for a sooner onset and/or more marked elevation. Conductance increases were prevented by timely back titration. Recently, it has been shown that serosal HCO3 reduces conductance by actions dependent on prostaglandins and serosal Na and sensitive to loop diuretics. Here, serosal HCO3 delayed the onset of acid-induced conductance increase by approximately 8 minutes, an effect reduced by omission of serosal Na and during exposure to serosal furosemide (10(-3) mol/L). In the presence of serosal indomethacin (10(-4) mol/L) and HCO3, prostaglandin E2 (10(-6) mol/L serosal bath) delayed the conductance increase. Because HCO3 secretion is negligible in this model, these results indicate effects of HCO3/prostaglandin E2 beyond mere buffering of invading hydrogen. These results are consistent with intracellular actions that tighten the paracellular pathway against acid and thus provide temporary protection from acid injury. In agreement with this view, HCO3 also limited conductance increases after luminal alkalinization by a furosemide-sensitive action.\r"

At 3 months, endoscopically proved ulcer relapse occurred in 16% receiving 20 mg omeprazole 3 days a week; 21% receiving 10 mg omeprazole daily; and 50% receiving placebo. At 6 months, corresponding rates were 23%, 27%, and 67% with 95% confidence intervals of difference between the placebo group and omeprazole groups of 28%-60% and 24%-56% (P less than 0.00001), respectively, and between omeprazole groups of -19%-11% (NS).

Various measures of intestinal transit revealed delayed transit in the portal hypertensive group.

Longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations were preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine and release was evoked by electrical field stimulation and KCl administration. Preincubation of preparations with desipramine or pretreatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine significantly suppressed the uptake and evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine; electrical field stimulation but not KCl-evoked release of [3H] norepinephrine was sensitive to tetrodotoxin. These results confirm the presence of functioning sympathetic nerves in the preparations. T. spiralis infection was associated with significant suppression of both electrical field stimulation and KCl-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine on the sixth day postinfection, and the suppression persisted 100 days postinfection. No suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release was seen in the worm-free and noninflamed ileum of infected rats. Suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release from the jejunum of infected rats was attenuated by treatment with betamethasone (3.0 mg/kg SC daily). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation suppresses the release of norepinephrine from the myenteric plexus in the Trichinella-infected rat.\r"

  ".W": "Rotavirus enteritis is the leading cause of diarrhea in infants worldwide. A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal L-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2-7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to L-glutamine (30 mmol/L) and L-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal D-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P less than 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na+ absorption to a similar degree (2-2.5 muEq.cm-2.h-1), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaCl absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl- flux. Glutamine is a potentially useful substrate for investigation in oral rehydration solutions for infant diarrhea.\r"

The collection of colonocytes was performed using a modified nonenzymatic isolation procedure based on Ca2+ chelation and gentle mechanical dissociation. Light and electron microscopy histomorphological examinations, [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, and activity gradients of alkaline phosphatase, thymidine kinase, and cytoskeleton-associated protein tyrosine kinase indicated that distinct cell populations were harvested from the various crypt regions in a temporal sequence mirroring their zonal and functional distribution in situ. After dimethylhydrazine administration, marked protein tyrosine kinase activity was noted in colonic cells harvested from upper crypt zones. The misplaced and sustained kinase activity preceded the actual polyp or tumor formation. This observation is consistent with the expansion of colonic proliferative compartments beyond allowable boundaries during the preneoplastic period. Companion studies in human colonic epithelial specimens corroborate the findings observed in normal and transformed murine colonocytes. It is believed that the characterization and manipulation of colonocytes using our in vitro model will provide important clues to the molecular events underlying the differentiation program and carcinogenic process in the colonic cell.\r"

  ".W": "Porcine distal colon epithelium was mounted in Ussing chambers and bathed with porcine Ringer's solution. The effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, norepinephrine, and carbamylcholine on Na and Cl fluxes and transepithelial electrical parameters were determined after their serosal administration. Vasoactive intestinal peptide increased the Cl-dependent component of the short-circuit current with a half-maximal effect at 115 nmol/L. Transepithelial Na and Cl flux studies demonstrated that the increase in current was caused by stimulation of Cl secretion. Norepinephrine also stimulated Cl secretion and increased the serosal-to-mucosal Na flux, producing a half-maximal effect at 1.6 mumol/L. Selective blockade of alpha 1 adrenoceptors by 0.5 mumol/L prazosin produced an eightfold decrease in norepinephrine potency. Carbamylcholine produced a significant increase in Cl secretion and decreased absorption of both Na and Cl with a concentration of 10 mumol/L producing a half-maximal effect. The muscarinic cholinoceptor blocker atropine (0.1 mumol/L) produced a 22-fold decrease in carbamylcholine potency. The effects of all three transmitter substances were unaffected after pretreatment of tissues with the neuronal conduction-blocker tetrodotoxin or an inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism. These results indicate that (a) vasoactive intestinal polypeptide stimulates Cl secretion without affecting Na absorption; (b) norepinephrine acting through alpha 1 adrenoceptors stimulates net Cl secretion and activates a serosal-to-mucosal Na transport mechanism; and (c) carbamylcholine acting through muscarinic receptors stimulates Cl secretion and inhibits Na and Cl absorption.\r"

  ".U": "91130764\r", 
  ".W": "The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of porcine galanin-(1-29), N-terminal fragment galanin-(1-10), C-terminal fragment galanin-(15-29), and the middle fragment galanin-(7-16) on the spontaneous tension of the opossum internal anal sphincter and on the decrease in the resting internal anal sphincter tension in response to neural stimulation by electrical field stimulation. Galanin and galanin-(1-10) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the resting tension of internal anal sphincter and an augmentation of the percent decrease in the resting tension with electrical field stimulation. Galanin-(15-29), on the other hand, produced an increase in the resting tension of the internal anal sphincter and had no effect on the electrical field stimulation-induced decrease in the resting tension. Galanin-(7-16) produced no significant effect on the internal anal sphincter. The decrease in the internal anal sphincter tension by galanin and galanin-(1-10) was partially antagonized by tetrodotoxin, whereas the increase in the internal anal sphincter tension caused by galanin-(15-29) was not modified by tetrodotoxin. In contrast to its effect in the internal anal sphincter, galanin caused an increase in the resting tension and suppressed a decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter tension in response to electrical field stimulation. From these findings we conclude that (a) galanin exerts an inhibitory effect on the internal anal sphincter by activating galanin receptors both at the intramural inhibitory neurons and at the internal anal sphincter smooth muscle and that the N-terminal portion of galanin may be responsible for these actions; (b) the contractile action of galanin is produced by its action on the smooth muscle; and (c) the actions of galanin on the gastrointestinal tract are tissue specific.\r"

Paralleling these structural responses, epithelial permeability to ions and nutrient-sized solutes increases. However, it is not known how these observed permeability changes specifically relate to the structural alterations elicited by glucose. Using a hemeconjugated peptide tracer (MP-11; mol wt, approximately 1900), the present study shows that the glucose-elicited tight-junction dilatations are specific anatomical sites of junctional permeation. This peptide tracer penetrates tight junctions selectively at sites of dilatations and is detected focally within the paracellular space. This same tracer does not penetrate junctions when glucose is not present. A heme-conjugated macromolecule (horseradish peroxidase; mol wt, approximately 40,000) is excluded by both glucose-exposed and glucose-unexposed tissues. The results of this study show a paracellular pathway for small peptides that is regulated during Na(+)-glucose-activated absorption. It is speculated that the paracellular pathway may contribute to the meal-related oligopeptide absorption that is known to occur and has previously been wholly attributed to the transcellular route.\r"

The mean bromodeoxyuridine (+/- SE) labeling index for 10 patients in an early histological stage (stage I, 4, and stage II, 6, 3.4% +/- 0.4%) of primary biliary cirrhosis was 17 times that for 6 control subjects (0.2% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001), and was significantly higher than that for 19 female patients with chronic aggressive hepatitis (0.9% +/- 0.2%, P less than 0.001), 14 compensated cirrhotic patients of viral origin (all female, 1.1% +/- 0.3%, P less than 0.01), and 5 patients with stage III primary biliary cirrhosis (0.5% +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) liver volume in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis (1225 +/- 40 cm3) was about 1.5 times that in control subjects (835 +/- 42 cm3, P less than 0.001). These results suggest that liver volume has already become large in the early stage of primary biliary cirrhosis perhaps because of markedly increased DNA synthesis in hepatocytes.\r"

Although patients and controls showed significant increases in free fatty acid concentration (respectively, 48% +/- 12% and 53% +/- 17%) and turnover (55% +/- 14% and 71% +/- 21%) during short-term starvation, the values after 16- and after 22-hour starvation were higher in cirrhosis. Fat oxidation was enhanced in the patients, but did not increase during fasting in contrast to controls (increase 19% +/- 17%, P less than 0.05). Net glucose oxidation was decreased in postabsorptive cirrhotics (P less than 0.05). Although postabsorptive glucose turnover was not different from controls, starvation induced a greater decrease in glucose turnover in the patients (25% +/- 3% vs. 10% +/- 3%, P less than 0.05). This was not reflected in plasma glucose concentrations. In conclusion, the effects of starvation on glucose and fat metabolism are enhanced in cirrhosis; fasting hypoglycemia is prevented by decreased use of glucose. It remains to be established whether these changes are merely explained by defective liver function, per se.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ascites on the energy metabolism of patients with liver cirrhosis. The resting energy expenditure was determined in 10 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites of moderate or large volume. The resting energy expenditure measurement was performed using indirect calorimetry and the resting energy expenditure predictive value was calculated with the Harris-Benedict equation, both before and after removal of ascitic fluid by paracentesis. Metabolic stress factors were absent in all cases. After an interval of 11.2 +/- 7.7 days between measurements, a weight loss of 16.6 +/- 10.3 kg was observed with paracentesis. The resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry showed a statistically significant decrease from 1682 +/- 291 to 1523 +/- 240 kcal/day (P less than 0.005) after removal of ascites. The repeatability of our indirect calorimetry method only allowed for the analysis of the results in 4 of 10 patients in whom ascites removal produced a consistent decrease in resting energy expenditure. There were no statistically significant differences between the measurements obtained by indirect calorimetry and those provided by the Harris-Benedict equation, but the latter had a moderate reliability in predicting the real resting energy expenditure of every patient. Our results suggest that, far from being an inert volume, ascites may be associated, at least in some patients, with an increased resting energy expenditure and therefore accelerate the appearance of protein energy malnutrition with corresponding complications.\r"

In this study, liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were analyzed for expression of two major pathways of adhesion used by cytotoxic T cells to interact with target cells. The lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 was found preferentially expressed on hepatocytes of patients with active hepatitis B virus replication, whereas the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes seemed more closely related with inflammatory activity. Adhesion molecules were also highly expressed on T lymphocytes found in areas of piecemeal and spotty necrosis, indicating the presence of antigen-specific \"memory\" T cells at the site of hepatocellular injury. This study suggests that the expression of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 on hepatocytes may be important for viral elimination. The coordinate expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 may regulate inflammatory response and enhance viral antigen presentation to T cells. Conversely, the absence of hepatocyte adhesion molecules might be a favorable factor for viral persistence.\r"

One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and virtually normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in the majority of subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who became noncompliant with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplants.

It was never detected in spleen, liver, kidney, heart, or lung. The detection limit of the assay system was 12 ng/mg protein, so that pancreatitis-associated protein levels increased at least 100-fold in pancreatic tissue during the acute phase. The molecular weight (12,000) and isoelectric point (8.2) were determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy showed that the protein was synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and stored in zymogen granules before being secreted, similar to other pancreatic secretory proteins. Immunoblotting and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the same protein was synthesized upon induction of pancreatitis by cerulein infusion, by retrograde injection of bile acids, or pancreatitis induced by pancreatic surgery. The pancreatitis-associated protein is therefore an acute-phase protein that differs from other proteins of that family because of its exocrine nature.\r"

Serum bilirubin levels were about the same in type 1 and 2 patients and amounted to 236 +/- 62 mumol/L and 214 +/- 82 mumol/L, respectively. In addition the fractional bilirubin excretion ratio, calculated as the ratio ([bilirubin in bile]/[bilirubin in serum])/([bile acid in bile]/[bile acid in serum]) could not differentiate between these two groups. However, there was a 10-fold and 100-fold difference of this ratio between patients with Crigler-Najjar disease and those with Gilbert's syndrome and between patients with Crigler-Najjar disease and controls. The fractional bilirubin excretion ratio proved an excellent tool to differentiate between Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar disease, whereas Crigler-Najjar disease types 1 and 2 could be differentiated on the basis of bile pigment analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty percent of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who undergo distal splenorenal shunting for variceal bleeding lose portal perfusion within 1 year. Although it was previously considered that this loss of portal flow was irrevocable, the present study shows that with resolution of alcoholic hepatitis, portal perfusion can be restored. A 34-year-old patient with alcoholic liver disease and a distal splenorenal shunt lost portal perfusion 1 year after the operation. He had continued to drink alcohol and had high sinusoidal pressure. Following forced abstinence over the next 2 years, his sinusoidal pressure fell, liver volume decreased, results of liver biopsy improved, and portal perfusion was restored. Shunt patency was documented, and the same collaterals from the portal vein to the shunt could still be visualized as had been seen when portal flow was absent. Restoration of portal perfusion was attributed to decreased intrahepatic resistance secondary to abstinence from alcohol. A return to drinking in the next 9 months led to alcoholic hepatitis and once again loss of portal perfusion. This study places emphasis on increased intrahepatic resistance rather than the development of portal-to-shunt collaterals as important in the loss of portal flow in such patients.\r"

In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized.\r"

In an infant with microvillus inclusion disease (confirmed by electron microscopic evaluation of rectal, jejunal, and gallbladder mucosae), basal stool output was massive (greater than 125 mL . kg-1 . day-1) and was not altered by treatment with clonidine or octreotide. A proximal jejunostomy with mucous fistula was placed, allowing separation of proximal from distal tract outputs (60 mL . kg-1 . day-1 and 100 mL . kg-1 . day-1, respectively). A 10-cm jejunal segment was excised during surgery and mounted in Ussing chambers for determination of transepithelial Na+ and Cl fluxes. Compared with intestine of normal infants, this infant's epithelium showed transmural conductance and unidirectional ion fluxes that were only 30% of normal. With respect to both Na+ and Cl, the excised jejunum was in a net secretory state. Theophylline (5 mmol/L) increased net Cl secretion slightly. In response to mucosal D-glucose (30 mmol/L), jejunal mucosal-to-serosal Na+ flux doubled. In the infant, glucose-electrolyte solution administered intrajejunally did not significantly change stool output, suggesting that all of the solution (40 mL/kg) was absorbed. Subtotal enterocolectomy, in theory, could have decreased purging by 66% in this infant with microvillus inclusion disease, but diarrhea would still have been significant.\r"

Real-time ultrasonography showed anechoic masslike lesions at the porta hepatis communicating with the superior mesenteric vein and intrahepatic portal branches. This suggested the presence of two saccular portal vein aneurysms, 27 x 21 mm and 21 x 13 mm in size. Magnetic resonance imaging and portal venography confirmed the portal vein aneurysms and an unusually tortuous portal vein curving caudally between them. The liver was histologically normal and there was no evidence of portal hypertension. It is speculated that these portal vein aneurysms may have been congenital and that the associated tortuous portal vein might have been secondary to hemodynamic changes in the portal venous system.\r"

  ".U": "91130782\r", 
  ".W": "Primary biliary cirrhosis has been classified as a model autoimmune disease based on striking defects in immune regulation and the presence of autoantibodies to mitochondria. Until recently the significance and definition of mitochondrial autoreactivity was unknown. Since 1987, there has been a vast improvement in the understanding and definition of the biochemical and molecular target autoantigens. The cloning of complementary DNAs for mitochondrial antigens has led to the identification of three enzymes of the 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase family as the targets of the autoantibodies to mitochondria in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The major reactive autoantigen is the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Immunodominant sites on pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 (autoepitopes) have been mapped and have been shown to be the site of attachment of the functionally important lipoic acid prosthetic group. The autoepitope for the other enzymes probably occupies an equivalent site on the enzyme. The availability and definition of these mitochondrial autoepitopes have allowed specific questions to be addressed relating to the processing and targeting of these autoantigens as well as further studies on mechanisms of immunopathology. Similarly, the availability of well-defined autoantigens could contribute to the development of valid animal models in addition to the already described reproduction of the biliary ductular lesions by transfer of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Such models will facilitate specific study of the role of major histocompatibility complex expression and the characterization of T-cell reactivity. Thus, primary biliary cirrhosis is a key example of significant progress in autoimmunity being made by use of recombinant DNA technology.\r"

But when it does kick in, the Health Care Financing Administration's implementation of the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) is sure to transform both physician reimbursement and physician-hospital relations. Experts expect HCFA to use the RBRVS to raise reimbursement for primary care at the expense of specialty care; that could lead to tension between hospitals and specialty physicians, as those specialists pressure hospitals to help them make up for income losses. What's more, HCFA is already planning for the possibility that specialists hit by the RBRVS will raise their Medicare volume to recoup reimbursement declines. Just how successfully an individual hospital weathers the coming payment revolution will depend on its mix of specialties and its medical staff relationships. It's also clear, according to experts, that RBRVS implementation will create a strong incentive for hospitals to enter joint ventures or other arrangements with physicians for outpatient services.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital for total joint replacement were studied to determine their understanding of the elements of informed consent at the time when they signed the consent document before the operation and their recall of those elements six months after the operation. All patients received instruction from the same patient-educator before the operation. Each patient was asked to respond verbally to a questionnaire about the preoperative instruction. If a question was not answered correctly, tutoring was given until the patient gave the correct response. The consent document was not presented for signature until the patient could answer all questions correctly. In an interview six months after the operation, thirty-six of the thirty-eight patients were asked the same questions that they had answered before the operation. The recall of risks and benefits six months after the operation was compared with the understanding of risks and benefits that had been demonstrated before the operation by both the verbal questioning and the signed consent document. At six months, the number of patients who recalled the risks ranged from nine (25 per cent) who remembered the risk of infection to only one who remembered the risk of damage to a nerve or artery. More patients recalled the potential benefits: eight (22 per cent) for relief of pain and improved function and five (16 per cent) for improved motion.\r"

  ".W": "Nine of twelve family members from three generations were affected by an inherited form of cervical vertebral dysplasia. All of the affected people had an abnormality of the first cervical vertebra. Some also had defects of the axis and caudad to it. The mode of transmission of the disorder is autosomal dominant, with apparently complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Two patients had symptoms. One had a passively correctable tilt of the head, with an associated audible clunk and hypoplasia of the left superior facet of the second cervical vertebra. This patient had no local symptoms, neurological involvement, or muscle spasm. In the other patient, suboccipital pain developed. Radiographs revealed an anterior atlanto-occipital dislocation. The symptoms resolved after reduction and arthrodesis. Because of the apparently complete penetrance of this disorder, physicians caring for patients who have this type of congenital malformation of the cervical spine should consider examination of closely related members of the family. Clinical findings such as tilting of the head, torticollis, or limitation of cervical motion suggest that additional evaluation should be done. The examination should include lateral radiographs of the cervical spine in flexion and extension. Three-dimensional computed-tomography reformatting was helpful in demonstrating the complex cervical anatomy in our patients. Patients who have recognized abnormalities should be followed and should be re-examined whenever local or neurological symptoms develop. A magnetic resonance image of the spine in flexion and extension was valuable for identification of the potentially disastrous situation of impending damage to the cord in patients who had instability and evolving symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "91131661\r", 
  ".W": "With the use of ulnar nerves of cynomolgus monkeys, the present study examined whether basal laminae of Schwann cells can serve as conduits for regenerating axons in nerve allografts from non-human primates. A segment of ulnar nerve was transected distal to the elbow joint one week before grafting. In Group A, a distal segment of the transected nerve was transplanted, after freezing and thawing, into the ulnar nerve of another monkey, at a level that corresponded to that from which the graft was taken. In Group B (the control group), the segment of nerve was grafted in the same manner but without cryotreatment. Two weeks, five weeks, eight weeks, and five months after grafting, the graft and the host nerve were examined with light and electron microscopy. Within two weeks after grafting in Group A, after degradation of the cellular components of the Schwann cells, the basal laminae of the Schwann cells were intact in the form of tubes. Within five weeks, many regenerating axons grew out into these basal lamina tubes in the three-centimeter-long grafts and extended into the host nerve. As seen at the wrist (seven centimeters from the distal suture) five months after grafting, the axons exhibited fully mature myelination both in the graft and in the host nerve. In contrast, in Group B, in which the Schwann cells had not been disrupted by cryotreatment, cellular components and connective-tissue matrices, including basal laminae, had been degraded and had been replaced by invading cells, which filled the endoneurial spaces of the graft. Five months after grafting, axonal growth had been arrested in the graft one centimeter distal to the proximal suture. The beneficial effect in Group A appears to have been the result of the retention and preservation of intact basal laminae of Schwann cells after rapid removal of killed Schwann cells and myelin debris. Killing of Schwann cells by freezing before grafting may abolish the immune response to the Schwann cells in allografts and lead to fragmentation and disruption of myelin, which facilitates the rapid removal of myelin by macrophages.\r"

There were twelve excellent, four good, one fair, and two poor results. The interval between the unicompartmental replacement and the revision total knee arthroplasty ranged from eight months to eight years. At the time of the revision, a major osseous defect was found in sixteen knees (76 per cent). The duration of follow-up after the revision ranged from two to ten years. At the most recent follow-up examination, radiographs revealed at least one radiolucent line in thirteen knees (62 per cent). The technical difficulties associated with the revision operation are evidence that unicondylar arthroplasty is not a conservative procedure that allows a total knee arthroplasty to be done easily later. The results also do not support the argument that a revision performed after failure of a unicondylar arthroplasty is less technically demanding than one performed after a failed primary total knee arthroplasty.\r"

The arterial flow of blood in the affected femoral head was slightly decreased, but the difference from that on the normal side was not statistically significant. However, there was marked disturbance of the venous drainage in the diseased hip, elevated intraosseous pressure in the affected femoral neck, and increased intra-articular pressure in the involved hip compared with the normal side. An animal model was then created in twenty immature dogs, venous drainage was obstructed, and intraosseous pressure of the femoral head and neck was elevated by injection of four milliliters of semiliquid silicone into the femoral neck. In eleven of the dogs, areas of avascular necrosis resembling those associated with Legg-Perthes disease developed in the femoral head.\r"

  ".U": "91131665\r", 
  ".W": "We developed an in situ freeze-thaw model designed to simulate an ideally placed and oriented autogenous graft of the anterior cruciate ligament. In this model, the anterior cruciate ligament was exposed, and the femoral insertion, tibial insertion, and body of the anterior cruciate ligament were frozen in situ with specially designed freezing probes. Freeze-thaw cycles were repeated five times. We used the technique in thirty-three mature goats to study the biological and biomechanical outcomes of the devitalized and devascularized anterior cruciate ligament at zero, six, and twenty-six weeks after treatment. Thus, the collagen fibers of the simulated autogenous graft remain in normal anatomical position and the simulated graft is fixed under physiological tension. At twenty-six weeks, no statistically significant differences were noted between treated and contralateral control (untreated) ligaments relative to anterior-posterior translation, maximum force to rupture, stiffness in the linear region of the force-length curve, modulus of elasticity in the linear region, strain to maximum stress, or maximum stress. The only statistically significant difference was an increase in cross-sectional area of the ligament. This increase was 22 and 42 per cent greater than that in the control ligaments at six weeks and six months. At six months, the ligaments in the control group had an average mid-cross-sectional area of 17.7 +/- 1.2 square millimeters and the ligaments in the experimental group, 25.2 +/- 3.1 square millimeters. Changes in the size and density of the collagen fibrils also were demonstrated at six months. These observations are in sharp contrast to our previous studies of replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament, in which an allograft of the ligament or an allograft supplemented with a 3M ligament augmentation device (LAD; 3M, St. Paul, Minnesota) was used. In those studies, an average reduction in maximum strength of 75 per cent for the allografts and 50 per cent for the allografts that had a ligament-augmentation device was found at one year. We concluded that devitalized, devascularized anterior cruciate ligaments do not lose strength if the anatomical position and the orientation of the collagen fibers are not altered.\r"

Postoperatively, two patients needed an adjuvant procedure: one, a local rotation flap and the other, a split-thickness skin graft. Both patients had excellent restoration of function. The patient who had a fair result had a persistent limp and residual discomfort. There were no re-ruptures.\r"

Thirty of these wrists were subsequently treated with operative release of the first dorsal compartment, and twenty-two (73 per cent) of the thirty were found to have a separate compartment for the extensor pollicis brevis. The prevalence of a separate compartment is significantly higher than that in the general population, as shown in anatomical studies of cadavera.\r"

  ".U": "91131669\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the cause of valgus deformity of the hindfoot in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and to characterize the effects of the deformity on gait, two groups of patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and with gait analysis in the laboratory. Group 1 consisted of seven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and normal alignment of the feet and Group 2, of ten patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and valgus deformity of the hindfoot. In Group 2, the disease was of longer duration and the feet were more painful than in Group 1. There was no evidence of muscular imbalance, equinus contracture, valgus deformity of the tibiotalar joint, or isolated deficiency of the tibialis posterior (such as weakness, tenosynovitis, or rupture of the tendon) that could have contributed to the development of the valgus deformity. In the patients who had valgus deformity, quantitated electromyography demonstrated that the intensity and duration of activity of the tibialis posterior was significantly increased, apparently in an effort to support the collapsing longitudinal arch of the foot. Gait studies revealed decreases in velocity, stride length, and single-limb-support time, as well as delayed heel-rise in both groups, but the decreases were more marked in the patients who had valgus deformity. The results of this study suggest that valgus deformity of the hindfoot in rheumatoid patients results from exaggerated pronation forces on the weakened and inflamed subtalar joint. These forces are caused by alterations in gait secondary to symmetrical muscular weakness and the effort of the patient to minimize pain in the feet. Radiographs also suggested an association between the valgus deformity of the feet and valgus deformity of the knees in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Specimens were subjected to tibial torque, anterior tibial force, and varus-valgus bending moment at selected angles of flexion of the knee ranging from 0 to 45 degrees. Section of the medial collateral ligament did not change the force generated in the anterior cruciate ligament by applied varus moment. When valgus moment was applied to the knee, force increased dramatically after section of the medial collateral ligament; the increases were greatest at 45 degrees of flexion. Section of the medial collateral ligament had variable effects on the force generated in the anterior cruciate ligament during internal rotation but dramatically increased that generated during external rotation; these increases were greatest at 45 degrees. Section of the medial collateral ligament increased mean total torsional laxity by 13 degrees (at 0 degrees of flexion) to 20 degrees (at 45 degrees of flexion). Application of an anteriorly directed force to the tibia of an intact knee increased the force generated in the anterior cruciate ligament; this increase was maximum near the mid-part of the range of tibial rotation and minimum with external rotation of the tibia. Section of the medial collateral ligament did not change the force generated in the anterior cruciate ligament by straight anterior tibial pull near the mid-part of the range of tibial rotation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The results of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament as a free, autogenous, non-vascularized graft were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Eighty reconstructions in seventy-nine patients were evaluated after a minimum of two years. In forty-eight (60 per cent) of the knees, the reconstruction was augmented with an extra-articular lateral sling of iliotibial band. The patients were evaluated with a physical examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer, radiographs, a subjective questionnaire, and a revision of the scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery for rating ligaments. Postoperatively, seventy-six (95 per cent) of the eighty knees no longer gave way, and the pivot-shift test was negative in sixty-seven (84 per cent) of the knees. The average score on the ligament-rating scale was 93 points. All of the patients who had clinical instability at the time of the most recent follow-up had associated ligamentous instability that had not been appreciated or addressed at the time of reconstruction. Arthrometric evaluation revealed that the laxity differed by three millimeters or less from that of the untreated knee in sixty (76 per cent) of the treated knees. In the patient who had bilateral reconstruction, the laxity was the same in both knees. Seventeen patients, who had more than three millimeters of translation, also had additional related ligamentous instability, most commonly posterolateral instability and insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament. We think that major associated ligamentous instability predisposes the reconstruction to failure and should be corrected in conjunction with the reconstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An observational surveillance study was conducted to monitor the safety and effectiveness of treatment with Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine) (Digibind) in patients with digitalis intoxication. Before April 1986, a relatively limited number of patients received treatment with digoxin-specific Fab fragments through a multicenter clinical trial. Beginning with commercial availability in July 1986, this study sought additional, voluntarily reported clinical data pertaining to treatment through a 3 week follow-up. The study included 717 adults who received Digoxin Immune Fab (Ovine). Most patients were greater than or equal to 70 years old and developed toxicity during maintenance dosing with digoxin. Fifty percent of patients were reported to have a complete response to treatment, 24% a partial response and 12% no response. The response for 14% of patients was not reported or reported as uncertain. Six patients (0.8%, 95% confidence interval 0.3% to 1.8%) had an allergic reaction to digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Three of the six had a history of allergy to antibiotic drugs. Twenty patients (2.8%, 95% confidence interval 1.7% to 4.3%) developed recrudescent toxicity. Risk of recrudescent toxicity increased sixfold when less than 50% of the estimated dose of antibody was administered. A total of 215 patients experienced posttreatment adverse events. The events for 163 patients (76%) were judged to result from manifestations of underlying disease and thus considered unrelated to Fab treatment. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments were generally well tolerated and clinically effective in patients judged by treating physicians to have potentially life-threatening digitalis intoxication.\r"

From 1982 to 1985, 69 patients were treated with emergency angioplasty to attempt reperfusion of the infarct-related artery. Balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful in 20 patients (group 1) and successful in 49 patients (group 2). Initial clinical and angiographic findings in the groups with unsuccessful and successful angioplasty were similar with respect to age (60.5 +/- 2.3 versus 57 +/- 1.8 years), infarct location (65% versus 65% anterior) and gender (65% versus 67% male). Hemodynamic variables in the two groups, including systolic blood pressure (68 +/- 4.3 versus 73 +/- 1.6 mm Hg), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (24.4 +/- 2.4 versus 27 +/- 1.0 mm Hg) and initial ejection fraction (28.5 +/- 4% versus 32 +/- 2%), were also similar. Twenty-nine patients received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase; the overall rate of reperfusion was 34%. Group 1 patients had a short-term survival rate of 20%, compared with 69% in group 2 patients (p less than 0.0005). Thirty-eight patients survived the hospital period and were followed up for 24 to 54 months (mean 32.5 +/- 2.4). Five patients (all in group 2) died during follow-up. The long-term incidence rate of congestive heart failure was 19%, arrhythmia 21%, need for repeat angioplasty 17% and coronary artery bypass grafting 26%. Twenty-four month survival was significantly better in group 2 patients (54%) versus group 1 patients (11%, p = 0.003).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91131894\r", 
  ".W": "Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the incidence and clinical significance of elevated total plasma creatine kinase (CK) and MB isoenzyme fraction after apparently successful coronary angioplasty, a prospective study of 272 consecutive elective procedures was undertaken. Total CK (normal less than 100 IU/liter) and CK MB isoenzyme (normal less than 4%) were measured immediately after successful completion of the procedure and every 6 h for 24 h. All nonelective procedures and results not fulfilling all American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Task Force guideline criteria for a successful result were excluded from analysis. Of the 272 elective procedures, 249 (92%) were successfully; abnormally elevated CK or CK MB serum levels, or both, were found in 38 (15%) of the successful outcomes. Three patterns of abnormal enzymes were identified: 15 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 1), 4 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/litter and CK MB less than or equal to 4% (group 2) and 19 patients with CK less than 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 3). The three groups were distinguishable by the nature of the complications causing the enzyme release (in particular, the etiology and clinical manifestations). There were significantly more clinically apparent events in group 1 than in the other groups (13 of 15 versus 11 of 23, p less than 0.01) and more events associated with persistent electrocardiographic changes (p = 0.05) and chest pain (p less than 0.05). However, no clinically important sequelae were recognizable in any group at hospital discharge. Thus, abnormal cardiac serum enzyme release after apparently successful coronary angioplasty is 1) relatively common; 2) has many possible causes, including both minor complications and early reversibility of impending major complications; and 3) results in no permanent clinical sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "Dynamic coronary stenoses may be the cause of a variable angina threshold and rest angina in patients with chronic stable angina. It has been suggested that eccentric but not concentric coronary artery stenoses have the potential for dynamic changes of caliber in response to vasoactive stimuli. The vasomotor response of eccentric (asymmetric narrowing) and concentric (symmetric narrowing) coronary stenoses to ergonovine (20 micrograms intracoronary or 300 micrograms intravenous) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg intracoronary) was studied in 51 patients with chronic stable angina. Diameter of reference segments (angiographically normal segments proximal to the stenoses) and that of eccentric (n = 30) and concentric (n = 35) coronary stenoses that ranged from 50% to 90% luminal diameter reduction were measured by computerized quantitative angiography before and after ergonovine and isosorbide dinitrate. Ergonovine reduced stenosis diameter (by greater than or equal to 10%) in 80% of eccentric stenoses and 42% of concentric stenoses (p less than 0.05). Mean (+/- SEM) diameter reduction with ergonovine was 19 +/- 3% and 9.5 +/- 2% for eccentric and concentric stenoses, respectively (p less than 0.05). Isosorbide dinitrate increased coronary diameter (by greater than or equal to 10%) in 70% of eccentric and 43% of concentric stenoses (p less than 0.05). Mean diameter of eccentric stenoses increased from 1.15 +/- 0.05 to 1.35 +/- 0.06 mm after nitrate (18.6 +/- 2.5%), whereas diameter of concentric stenoses increased from 1.05 +/- 0.05 to 1.14 +/- 0.05 mm (10 +/- 2.5%) (p less than 0.05). Average dilation of reference segments with administration of isosorbide dinitrate and constriction with ergonovine were not significantly different in patients with concentric and eccentric stenoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 consisted of 60 patients with medical therapy and Group 2 of 79 patients with surgical therapy (septal myectomy). Groups 1 and 2 were subdivided according to the medical treatment. Group 1a received propranolol, 160 mg/day (n = 20); Group 1b verapamil, 360 mg/day (n = 18); and Group 1c, no therapy (n = 22). Group 2a received verapamil, 120 to 360 mg/day, after septal myectomy (n = 17) and Group 2b had no medical therapy after surgery (n = 62). In Group 1, 19 patients died (annual mortality rate 3.6%) and in Group 2, 17 patients died (mortality rate 2.4%, p = NS). Of the patients who died, approximately one half to two thirds in both Groups 1 and 2 died suddenly and the other one half to one third died because of congestive heart failure. The 10 year cumulative survival rate was 67% in Group 1, significantly smaller than that in Group 2 (84%, p less than 0.05). In the subgroups, the 10 year survival rate was 67% in Group 1a, 80% in 1b (p less than 0.05 versus 1a) and 65% in 1c (p less than 0.05 versus 1b). The 10 year survival rate was 100% in Group 2a (p less than 0.05 versus 1a, 1b, 1c) and 78% in Group 2b (p less than 0.05 versus 2a). It is concluded that cumulative survival rate is significantly better in surgically than in medically treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The position of the obstructed prosthesis was aortic in 51 patients (48%), mitral in 49 (46%) and both aortic and mitral in 6 (6%). The types of obstructed prosthetic valves were Bjork-Shiley (n = 51), St. Jude (n = 41) and Medtronic-Hall (n = 20). The time interval between valve replacement and obstruction ranged from 6 weeks to 13 years (median 4 years). Of 63% of patients in whom coagulation variables were available at the time of obstruction, 70% were receiving inadequate anticoagulant therapy. In 63% of the procedures the patient was in New York Heart Association functional class IV. Two patients underwent preoperative thrombolysis with incomplete results. Operative procedures included valve replacement (n = 81), valve declotting and excision of pannus (n = 23) and aortic valve replacement and mitral valve declotting (n = 2). The early mortality rate was 12.3% (13 patients), and there was no difference between surgery for mitral prostheses (12.2%) versus aortic prostheses (13.7%). The perioperative mortality rate was 17.5% (11 of 63 patients) in patients in functional class IV and 4.7% (2 of 43 patients) in those in functional classes I to III (p less than 0.05). For valve replacement, the mortality rate was 12% (10 of 81 patients) and for declotting of the prosthesis 13% (3 of 23 patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, magnesium was measured in the right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall in 23 autopsy subjects to determine whether there was a proportional relation between right atrial appendage and left ventricular free wall magnesium. The mean left ventricular free wall/right atrial appendage magnesium ratio was 2.13 +/- 0.39 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0009). In the group with cardiac surgery, the right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated inversely with age (r = -0.54, p = 0.001). The mean right atrial appendage magnesium concentration (micrograms/g wet weight tissue) was lower in patients with postoperative cardiac arrhythmia than in those without arrhythmia (103 +/- 13 versus 111 +/- 10, p = 0.009) and in diabetic than in nondiabetic patients (103 +/- 13 versus 109 +/- 12, p = 0.02). The right atrial appendage magnesium concentration also tended to be lower in patients receiving potassium/magnesium-losing diuretics, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance (105 +/- 14 versus 109 +/- 11, p = 0.16). Right atrial appendage magnesium concentration correlated positively with serum creatinine concentration (r = 0.31, p = 0.002) and negatively with serum calcium concentration (r = -0.29, p = 0.013). Serum magnesium did not correlate with right atrial appendage or mononuclear blood cell magnesium concentration or clinical variables. There was a statistically significant correlation between mononuclear blood cell and right atrial appendage magnesium concentrations in some subgroups of patients.\r"
