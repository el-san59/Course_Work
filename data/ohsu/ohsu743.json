One hypothesis, and the limited available empirical evidence, suggests that family members who perceive caregiving as stressful will experience some relief when their relative dies because care responsibilities end. An alternative hypothesis, derived from several conceptualizations, posits the opposite relationship, with greater care-related strain predictive of greater strain during bereavement. Panel data from spouse and adult-child caregivers collected before and after the death support the second hypothesis. Respondents who appraise caregiving as more difficult and those who report more negative caregiving consequences for the family assess bereavement as more difficult and report greater bereavement strain for the family.\r"

Forty five patients had reflux disease alone, 69 had evidence of oesophagitis which was assessed endoscopically and histologically. Recordings were also performed in 63 control patients. The occurrence of reflux was analysed for the total study period and particularly while awake, asleep, fasting, and during postcibal periods. Oesophageal acid exposure time and the number of reflux episodes lasting greater than five minutes during the total study period provided the best discrimination between patients and controls; however, 20% and 30% of all reflux patients had both normal (with 2 SD of control) acid exposure time and number of long lasting reflux episodes, respectively. Patients with oesophagitis had significantly more acid reflux than those with simple uncomplicated disease during postcibal, fasting, awake periods, but not during sleep; however, increasing severity of oesophagitis was not associated with increasing acid exposure. The ability of the intraluminal oesophageal pH test to discriminate patients with various degrees of reflux disease decreased if only postprandial pH variables were taken into account. We conclude that: (1) the 24 hour intraoesophageal pH monitoring may present false negative results that limit overall sensitivity of the test; (2) the presence of oesophagitis does not seem to be associated with increased oesophageal acid exposure during sleep; (3) limiting the pH recording to postprandial periods reduces the discriminatory power of the test.\r"

The finding of 'adhesion pedestals', which represents a cellular response to the presence of the organism, is analogous to the response of intestinal cells to enteropathogenic E coli. Thus the development of bacterial attachment sites in H pylori associated gastritis might be an indication of pathogenicity. We have therefore explored the relationship between the proportion of organisms forming attachment sites and histological indices of disease 'activity'. Antral biopsies from 40 patients with H pylori positive gastritis were examined histologically and ultrastructurally, and the percentage of attached organisms compared with subjective assessments of epithelial degeneration, mucin depletion, polymorphonuclear and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration. We found a significant increase in the proportion of attached bacteria in cases showing histological epithelial degeneration, and a significant decrease in cases showing intraepithelial polymorph infiltration. The direct relationship between bacterial attachment and cellular degeneration lends further support to a pathogenic effect. Reduced attachment in the face of polymorph infiltration might indirectly reflect aspects of the immune response--namely, blocking of adhesion by IgA, with complement activation and generation of leucotactic factors.\r"

The control group was eight patients with duodenal ulcers whose peak postprandial gastrin concentrations were less than 200 pmol/l. Basal and peak postprandial plasma gastrin concentrations were 107 (37) and 306 (66) pmol/l (mean (SEM] respectively in the hypergastrinaemic patients compared with 26 (4) and 137 (14) pmol/l respectively in the controls.

The number of enterochromaffin-like cells per high power field was 53 (8) in the hypergastrinaemic patients compared with 50 (8) in the controls.

In the first set of experiments, 300 ml beef consomme soup with or without 60 g margarine was fed to each of six volunteers, followed 20 minutes later by either a low fat solid meal or a preselected appetising meal. Subjects were allowed to eat as much of the meal as they wished. Preingestion of the high fat soup had no significant effect on the consumption of either of the solid meals and did not influence sensations of hunger or fullness. As we have previously shown that prefeeding a fatty soup delays gastric emptying of a subsequent meal, this suggests that gastric distension may play a relatively minor role in regulating food intake. In the second set of experiments, we studied the effect of ingesting either a high fat breakfast (65 g fat, 927 kcal) or a similar low fat breakfast (8-1 g fat, 418 kcal) on the consumption of a preselected appetising lunch in six healthy volunteers. The high fat breakfast significantly reduced the amount of the meal eaten at lunchtime (p less than 0.02), the total energy intake from the meal (p less than 0.05) and the rate of eating (p less than 0.05) compared with the low fat breakfast. When the subjects were presented with their lunchtime meal they felt significantly less hungry after the high fat breakfast (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The secretagogues used included agents acting via cyclic AMP (dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, forskolin, and PGE2) and those acting via Ca++ (acetylcholine, bethanecol, carbachol, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and A23187). Starving rats for 24 h (day 1) had no effect on the basal electrogenic secretion (measured as the short circuit current, Isc muamps/cm2) or on the stimulated maximum electrogenic secretion (measured as the delta Isc where delta Isc = maxIsc-basal Isc). By day 2 of starvation, however, both the basal Isc and the delta Isc induced by all the secretagogues were significantly greater than in the fed and increased even more on day 3. Replacement of all the chloride ions and inhibition by furosemide indicated that the enhanced secretion was due mainly to chloride ions. Cholinergic stimulation was blocked by atropine, indicating the stimulation was via muscarinic receptors while cholinergic dose - delta Isc response curves for fed and starved ilea showed significantly increased maximum electrogenic secretory response in the latter but no evidence of any change in the affinity (ED50) of the receptors mediating the response. The basal secretion and the secretory response to acetylcholine in both fed and starved ilea was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, revealing that the enhanced secretory response could be expressed via the muscarinic receptors on the enterocytes without the enteric neural network. Measurement of ileal fluid movement in vivo showed that in fed and day 1 starved rats the basal, unstimulated 'tone' of the ileum was absorptive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At 12 weekly intervals patients were asked, by means of standardised questionnaires, about infections, compliance with maintenance medication, new drug treatment, dietary changes, episodes of non-bloody diarrhoea, life stresses, and feelings of anxiety and depression. Thirty five patients (38%) relapsed (median interval 17 weeks, range three to 46 weeks). Patients who relapsed had a higher previous relapse rate than non-relapsers (p less than 0.001) and a shorter time from previous relapse to trial entry (p less than 0.05). Other clinical characteristics were equally matched in the two groups. Between and within group comparisons revealed that upper respiratory tract symptoms, antibiotic ingestion, analgesic intake, diarrhoeal episodes and stressful life events were no more common in the four weeks before relapse than before routine attendance. Anxiety and depression ratings were also similar in the two groups. The timing of ulcerative colitis relapse showed a clear seasonal pattern with 26 patients relapsing from August to January and only nine from January to July (p less than 0.001). In addition, a retrospective case note analysis revealed significant seasonality of onset of ulcerative colitis. We conclude that seasonal factors may contribute to both onset and relapse of ulcerative colitis.\r"

We used a system constituted of neutrophils, triggered with phorbol myristate acetate, and 51Cr-labelled Daudi cells as targets. The results show that 5-ASA is capable of efficiently preventing neutrophil-mediated lysis. 5-ASA was up to 10-fold more effective than taurine, which acts as an hypochlorous acid scavenger. Moreover, 5-ASA was found to compete with taurine for the neutrophil derived hypochlorous acid. The results are consistent with the conclusion that 5-ASA is capable of limiting the neutrophil mediated cell damage by scavenging the generated hypochlorous acid. This may represent a potential mechanism for the therapeutic action of 5-ASA in ulcerative colitis.\r"

Neutrophils from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis produced significantly lower chemiluminescent responses after chemotactic stimulation with formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP) than neutrophils from control patients, p = 0.018 and 0.043 respectively. Chemiluminescent responses of neutrophils from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, however, were similar to control responses when cells were stimulated with latex beads or phorbol myristate acetate. Monocytes from patients with Crohn's disease produced significantly greater levels of chemiluminescence than control monocytes when stimulated with either fMLP (p less than 0.002), phorbol myristate acetate (p less than 0.0005) or latex beads (p less than 0.002). Monocytes from patients with ulcerative colitis also produced significantly greater levels of chemiluminescence than controls when stimulated with latex beads (p less than 0.5) or phorbol myristate acetate (p less than 0.0005), although there was no difference in the level of chemiluminescence in response to fMLP. These results exclude a generalised defect in phagocytic cell oxidase activity in inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that circulating monocytes are 'activated'.\r"

In the very preterm neonate marked urinary salt wasting occurs because of immature renal tubular function, but little is known of the ontogeny of colonic transport processes. Using an in vivo rectal dialysis technique, we have shown that in the human infant the colon has well developed salt conserving mechanisms from early in the last trimester of gestation and that aldosterone is an important regulatory hormone. Sodium transport mechanisms in the colon appear to develop before those in the kidney and it is possible that the colon is the major organ of sodium conservation in the preterm neonate.\r"

The effect is perhaps the result of an inactivation of gut derived endotoxins but the exact mechanism of action is, however, unknown. Tumour necrosis factor is an important mediator of endotoxin toxicity. The cytokine tumour necrosis factor is mainly produced by mononuclear phagocytes. In this study, the effect of lactulose on the endotoxin induced tumour necrosis factor release by monocytes was investigated. The direct effect of lactulose on endotoxin was tested in a chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. Polymyxin B a known inactivator of endotoxin was used as control in both experiments. Lactulose has a limited capacity to inactivate endotoxin as measured in the endotoxin assay. In contrast lactulose significantly reduced endotoxin induced tumour necrosis factor production by monocytes. In conclusion lactulose inhibits tumour necrosis factor production by a direct inhibitory effect on monocytes, rather than by inactivation of endotoxin. Because tumour necrosis factor is an important mediator of endotoxin toxicity, this inhibitory effect could explain the beneficial effect of lactulose in obstructive jaundice.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the basis of subclinical alveolitis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 10 primary biliary cirrhosis patients were studied by bronchoalveolar lavage. Both bronchoalveolar lavage lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell populations were analysed using immunocytological methods to determine their proportions and phenotypic features in an attempt to gain information as to possible immune mechanisms active in the lung of these patients. Six of the 10 patients in our study showed evidence of an alveolitis (raised lymphocyte count: 27.6 (4.3)% of total count) on lavage. The results were compared with control groups of normal volunteers and patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis. The six primary biliary cirrhosis patients with lymphocytosis had a raised CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio (4.13:1), similar to the sarcoid patients (5.60:1). A proportion of these T-lymphocytes expressed markers of activation (HLA-DR+ 7.5 (2.1)%); CD25 + 2.3 (0.9)%; CD7 + 5.8 (1.5)%. This increased T-cell activation was also seen in the sarcoid groups (HLA-DR+ 10.0 (1.9)%; CD25 + 3.0 (1.1)%; CD7 + 5.0 (0.2)%). This was not seen in the primary biliary cirrhosis patients without lymphocytosis and the normal volunteers. Within the non-lymphoid cell population, an increase in dendritic (RFD1+) cells was seen in primary biliary cirrhosis patients with lymphocytosis (31.2 (1.9)%) and sarcoid patients (46.3 (5.1)%) in contrast with the normal and primary biliary cirrhosis group without lymphocytosis. The primary biliary cirrhosis patients without lymphocytes had a relatively greater proportion of mature phagocytes (RFD7+). We postulate that these observations suggest the emergence in the lung of a granuloma producing mechanism similar to that occurring in the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleed occurred in 15 patients during sclerotherapy. Recurrence of oesophageal varices was seen in 15 patients. Ten patients developed bulbous gastric varices after obliteration. Major complications including perforation and strictures were seen more commonly in children. Sclerotherapy was associated with a significant reduction in the bleeding rate (bleeds/month/patient) as compared with the presclerotherapy period (p less than 0.001). Endoscopic sclerotherapy is an effective and safe modality in the prevention of variceal bleeds in patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction.\r"

In this study, changes in plasma concentrations of catecholamines and histamine were determined after the administration of morphine in patients with and without a two-fold or greater rise in the plasma concentration of aspartate aminotransferase at four hours. Those showing rises in aminotransferase had higher concentrations of noradrenaline at 40 and 60 minutes after morphine and higher concentrations of dopamine at 40 minutes after morphine. The two groups had similar concentrations of adrenaline and histamine. Attempts to inhibit rises in aminotransferase after morphine by pretreatment with histamine, serotonin and alpha-receptor blockers were largely unsuccessful, although inhibition was observed with phenoxybenzamine in two of five patients. Higher plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine before and soon after induction of pain in patients showing rises in aminotransferase are consistent with sympathetic activation but heterogeneity appears to exist in the response to alpha-receptor blockade.\r"

Stone disintegration was achieved in 70% of common bile duct stones and in all intrahepatic concrements after 800-7500 discharges, which were applied during one (n = 21), two (n = 6) or three sessions (n = 6). Apart from mild fleabite-like petechiae at the side of shock wave transmission no other side effects were observed for a total of 51 procedures.

We studied six gall stone subjects before and during treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid 675 mg/day. Lipid mass within the gall bladder correlated with the corresponding overnight hepatic secretion rate for all three biliary lipids. During ursodeoxycholic acid treatment, there was an increase in gall bladder bile acid mass without significant change in cholesterol or phospholipid mass. We conclude that the mass of individual biliary lipids within the fasting gall bladder is influenced by overnight hepatic biliary lipid secretion rate; and that the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (675 mg/day) on cholesterol saturation index of fasting gall bladder bile is mediated via an increase in bile acid mass rather than through a decrease in cholesterol mass within the gall bladder.\r"

Endoscopic sphincterotomy has been recommended for those patients with confirmed sphincter of Oddi motor abnormalities. We have studied sphincter of Oddi dysfunction patients to evaluate the effects of endoscopic sphincterotomy on both clinical symptoms and previously reported scintigraphic parameters to determine the efficacy of this method of treatment. Nine postcholecystectomy patients (seven women: two men, median age 59 years) with clinical and manometric evidence of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for persisting biliary type pain. Each patient had scintigraphy before and eight weeks after endoscopic sphincterotomy. The patients symptomatic response was assessed independently at three monthly intervals after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Scintigraphic analysis showed that the TMAX (time in minutes to maximum counts) was significantly reduced from 25.0 (20-36) (median [range]) before endoscopic sphincterotomy to 15.0 (13-25) after endoscopic sphincterotomy (p less than 0.01). Seven of nine (78%) sphincter of Oddi dysfunction patients had significant improvement in their symptoms after a mean follow up period of 12 months (range 6-19) although only six of nine were totally pain free. These results suggest that endoscopic sphincterotomy in manometrically confirmed sphincter of Oddi dysfunction improves bile drainage as measured by quantitative cholescintigraphy and is associated with at least short term symptom relief in the majority of patients.\r"

Twenty-eight patients with cirrhosis without previous bleeding or known presence of varices were subjected to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Each endoscopy was videotaped and shown to 22 endoscopists. The varices were graded on a scale of 0 to 3 according to size. Each endoscopist diagnosed varices in 8 to 20 patients (mean = 15.9). Overall agreement on the presence (grades 1 to 3) or absence (grade 0) of varices was 70%. The average kappa value was 0.38 (standard deviation = 0.16). Discrimination between varices graded 0 to 1 and varices graded 2 to 3 gave a higher kappa value (p less than 0.01) of 0.52 (standard deviation = 0.17). There was a large variation in kappa values (range = -0.025 to 0.975). No significant correlation was observed between kappa values for the two dichotomies (range = 0.16). The kappa values were not related to the experience of the endoscopist. Considerable variation in the agreement on diagnosis and grading of esophageal varices was found. These results must be taken into account in the assessment of trials of prophylaxis of first-time variceal bleeding.\r"

We report here a prospective study of the treatment of 27 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 22 cirrhotic patients with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. The infection of ascitic fluid was diagnosed by a positive culture plus an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 75/microliters, or by an ascitic neutrophil count exceeding 500/microliters. The infection was treated with 1 gm amoxicillin and 0.2 gm clavulanic acid every 6 hr for 14 days. In 17 cases (63%), bacteria were isolated from the ascitic fluid. All the bacteria isolated were sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, whereas in five cases they were resistant to amoxicillin alone (Escherichia coli in two cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases and Bacteroides fragilis in one case). Cure of the infection was achieved in 23 episodes (85%) after 14 days' treatment; 17 patients (63%) were able to leave the hospital. Fourteen of 20 patients (70%) treated for the first episode of infection died within 1 yr: eight from infection, two from gastrointestinal hemorrhage, one from infection and hemorrhage and three from tumors. One patient who had repeated infections underwent liver transplantation and has not had any infectious complications 1.5 yr after surgery. Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid may be an effective first-line therapy for ascitic fluid infection in cirrhosis. Nevertheless, the 1-yr prognosis continues to be grave and the severity of the underlying liver disease remains the most important determinant for survival.\r"

Conversely, a low-protein diet reduces renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intravenous amino acid infusion and dietary proteins on kidney function in cirrhosis. Protocol 1: renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured before and during intravenous administration of a 10% amino acid solution (0.043 ml/kg/min) to eight compensated cirrhotic patients (group 1), nine nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites (group 2) and seven cirrhotic patients with ascites and functional renal failure (group 3). Amino acid administration induced a significant increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate in all groups studied. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate increased by 16% and 14%, respectively, in group 1; 31% and 22% in group 2 and 25% and 21% in group 3. Protocol 2: Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured in nine cirrhotic patients with ascites after 11 days on a low-protein diet (0.5 gm/kg body weight/day) and also after the patients followed for 11 days a moderately high-protein diet (1.5 gm/kg body weight/day). The moderately high-protein diet was associated with a significant increase in renal plasma flow (12%) and glomerular filtration rate (13%) compared with values obtained while the patients followed the low-protein diet. Plasma glucagon levels increased markedly during the intravenous administration of amino acid and the intake of the moderately high-protein diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Isolated hepatocyte cultures have become a frequently used model system for investigating drug metabolism. Although rat and hamster hepatocytes are frequently used for this purpose, metabolism in these species differs in many respects from human metabolism. A species with a metabolism more closely resembling that of humans might be more useful. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that the metabolism of propranolol in the rabbit is more similar to that in humans than in rats or hamsters. We therefore examined the usefulness of rabbit parenchymal liver cells for studies of propranolol metabolism. A detailed method is presented for their preparation and culture, along with data on their viability, structure and protein synthesizing capability. One- or two-day-old hepatocyte cultures were exposed to 10 mumol/L 3H-propranolol from 30 min to 2 hr; metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Propranolol metabolism was linear over 1 hr, with 15% of the substrate metabolized during this time. The cytochrome P-450 pathways, which result in ring oxidation and side-chain oxidation, were expressed in a reproducible fashion similar to that found in vivo in humans. The arylhydrocarbon hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-naphthoflavone (100 mumol/L) inhibited side-chain oxidation of propranolol by 90% without affecting ring oxidation. In contrast, chlorpromazine (100 mumol/L) was shown to inhibit ring oxidation of propranolol by 85% without affecting side-chain oxidation. Cimetidine (250 mumol/L) inhibited both pathways by about 50%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90185572\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that a 37-kD liver protein formed an adduct with acetaldehyde in vivo when rats were fed alcohol chronically. To understand the mechanism of the formation of this protein-acetaldehyde adduct, rat hepatocytes in primary culture were treated with ethanol in vitro for several days. When cultured in hormone-enriched and trace metal-enriched Waymouth's medium, alcohol dehydrogenase activities in hepatocytes decreased only about 30% during 6 days of culture. At the end of the specified time, protein extracts of hepatocytes were immunotransblotted with rabbit immunoglobulin G that recognized acetaldehyde adduct as an epitope. The 37-kD protein-acetaldehyde adduct band could be detected within 3 days in cells that had been treated with alcohol at a steady-state concentration as low as 5 mmol/L. Although the maximal intensity was obtained at approximately 10 to 40 mmol/L ethanol, addition of cyanamide (an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase) further increased the intensity of this protein-acetaldehyde adduct band by more than twofold. A good correlation existed between acetaldehyde concentration in the medium and the intensity of the 37-kD protein-acetaldehyde adduct band. Formation of the 37-kD liver protein-acetaldehyde adduct is thus dependent on acetaldehyde, and the 37-kD protein is apparently unusually susceptible to chemical modification by acetaldehyde.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies reacting with the galactose-specific hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor--a liver-specific component expressed on the surfaces of hepatocytes--are often found in patients with chronic active hepatitis of presumed autoimmune origin. As part of an investigation into whether these anti-asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies might be involved in the development of periportal liver damage in chronic active hepatitis, livers of ether-anesthetized rats were perfused in situ with polyclonal guinea pig anti-rabbit asialoglycoprotein receptor or murine monoclonal anti-human galactose-specific hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor antibodies in excess at less than 8 degrees C or, as a control, with guinea pig anti-human plasma protein antibodies or normal guinea pig serum. Rapid (1 min) antegrade (by way of portal vein) or retrograde (through hepatic veins by way of vena cava) perfusions were performed in a nonrecirculating (once-through) mode in Ca+(+)-free medium. Blocks of liver tissue were immediately snap-frozen and the distribution of the antibody examined in cryostat sections by using an avidin-biotin immunohistochemical technique. In all of the perfusions with anti-asialoglycoprotein receptor (six antegrade, seven retrograde), the antibodies were found to be prominently and almost exclusively deposited on liver cells in the periportal areas. No deposition of immunoglobulins was detected in livers perfused with the control guinea pig sera. The findings suggest that the asialoglycoprotein receptor is expressed at high density mainly on cells in zone 1 of the hepatic lobule, and this may have implications for the development of periportal liver damage in chronic active hepatitis.\r"

  ".U": "90185574\r", 
  ".W": "Hepatic transferrin receptors were studied in normal male rats at 1 to 59 wk after weaning, using immunohistochemical and biochemical techniques. The number of transferrin receptors measured and the intensity of the staining in situ decreased rapidly during the first 10 wk of life and more slowly thereafter. Immunohistochemistry further demonstrated changes in the topographical and (sub)cellular localization of the transferrin receptor. In the young rat livers, staining was almost exclusively present on hepatocytes in acinar zone 2 + 3 in a honeycomb to sinusoidal pattern. With aging, a panacinar heterogeneous and mainly sinusoidal staining of hepatocytes was more frequent. Kupffer cell positivity was more obvious as compared with the young rat livers. The observed changes in transferrin receptor expression may partly be explained by age-dependent alterations in DNA synthesis and proliferative potential of the liver cells. A series of rats were iron loaded with carbonyl iron up to 39 wk and \"unloaded\" by administration of a normal diet during 20 wk. In these animals, serial histochemical studies showed predominantly parenchymal (7 to 14 wk), mixed parenchymal and reticuloendothelial (39 wk) and almost exclusive reticuloendothelial siderosis (59 wk). In the siderotic livers transferrin receptor numbers tended to be lower than in the controls with significant differences after 14 and 39 wk. Immunohistochemistry showed decreased parenchymal but increased reticuloendothelial transferrin receptor expression with iron load. After the period of unloading, parenchymal transferrin receptors were virtually absent despite the negligible siderosis of these cells. In contrast, siderotic reticuloendothelial cells were intensely positive. These findings support down-regulation of parenchymal transferrin receptor resulting from iron storage. However, the positivity of siderotic reticuloendothelial cells and the absence of re-emergence of parenchymal receptors in conditions of minimal parenchymal and prominent reticuloendothelial siderosis need further elucidation.\r"

  ".W": "D-galactosamine produces an early defect in protein synthesis, independent of its effects on RNA synthesis. Here we show that the defect in protein synthesis is inherent in purified ribosomal subunits in vitro. Further, galactosamine treatment is associated with an 85% decrease in methylation of ribosomal RNA, involving all sites (2'-0-ribose and base positions), intact ribosomes from galactosamine-treated animals can be methylated to a greater extent than control ribosomes and in vitro methylation restores their functional capacity. Statistical analyses of these data, along with those with a number of other hepatotoxins, reveal a correlation coefficient of r = 0.95 (p less than 0.003) between protein synthetic capacity and ribosomal RNA methylation, and linear regression accounts for more than 90% of the observed variation. In contrast, no relationship was found between nucleolar RNA methylation and protein synthetic capacity. A relationship of borderline statistical significance was found between messenger RNA methylation and protein synthetic capacity, but it does not appear consistent with results obtained after CCl4 intoxication. These results lend strong support to the notion that methylation status of ribosomal RNA is an important control for protein synthesis in quiescent hepatocytes and that net hypomethylation is a common response to such divergent hepatotoxins as CCl4, ethionine and D-galactosamine.\r"

  ".W": "Liver biopsy specimens obtained from two groups of erythrohepatic protoporphyria patients were studied histopathologically and ultrastructurally. Group 1 comprised seven erythrohepatic protoporphyria patients with a normal liver histology; from two patients liver biopsy specimens were available before and after 1 yr of chenodeoxycholic acid treatment. Group 2 consisted of four patients with a history of liver disease and liver histopathology; three patients were observed before and after 1 yr of chenodeoxycholic acid treatment. Liver specimens of nine kidney transplant donors served as controls. Unlike the morphology at the light microscopic level, the ultrastructure of hepatic parenchymal cells was affected in both groups of erythrohepatic protoporphyria patients. In both groups the nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, lateral plasma membranes and bile canaliculi were altered. Collagen fibers were frequently present. In addition, in group 2 bile thrombi and intracytoplasmic protoporphyrin crystals were observed. After chenodeoxycholic acid administration, the latter feature had diminished. It is concluded that (a) in erythrohepatic protoporphyria ultrastructural changes are present in the hepatic parenchymal cells even in early stages of the disease. Changes in bile canalicular ultrastructure suggest a defective hepatic excretory function, probably caused by the toxic effect of protoporphyrin. (b) Chenodeoxycholic acid administration causes no distinct improvement of the ultrastructure of organelles in the hepatic parenchymal cell or the bile canalicular system but may decrease crystalline protoporphyrin deposition in the liver.\r"

An investigation into the incidence and prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis was conducted and the course of the disease was followed. In total, 111 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were identified for the 10-yr period 1973 to 1982 in the northern health region of Sweden. The mean annual incidence amounted to 13.3 per million and the point prevalence was 151 per million, which is the highest reported so far. There was a significantly higher prevalence in the most northern county of Sweden, both with respect to total number of primary biliary cirrhosis patients and symptomatic patients. Asymptomatic patients amounted to 37%. During the study period 25 patients out of the 111 died (23%), 14 as a direct consequence of the liver disease. Three patients died of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, one having an asymptomatic liver disease without cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis seems to be more common in Sweden, especially in the northern part, than it is elsewhere. A high frequency of extrahepatic symptoms (85%), mainly musculoskeletal, was recorded. These symptoms may lead to the first contact with the health service, rather than signs of liver disease. Thus, an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with asymptomatic liver disease, who must be followed to check for the eventual development of symptoms.\r"

Six patients' samples showed rejection. Four patients, including two with rejection, demonstrated ischemic change. Three patients showed focal fibrosis, polymorphonuclear infiltration and bile duct proliferation simulating biliary obstruction, although biliary stones were found in only one patient. Three patients had acute hepatitis. Seven patients had a pattern of chronic persistent hepatitis; four had chronic active hepatitis. Follow-up biopsy samples were obtained in seven chronic hepatitis patients. Two of the patients with chronic hepatitis patients. Two of the patients with chronic active hepatitis have shown slight progression of the disease. None has progressed to cirrhosis, but neither has the chronic active hepatitis resolved. It is likely that some of these cases represent non-A, non-B hepatitis. Although histological abnormalities are common after successful transplantation, the clinical significance of many of the changes remains to be determined. Only patients with rejection or vascular thromboses required new transplants.\r"

All livers that received initial arterialization showed uniform diffuse perfusion, whereas those with initial portal perfusion were patchy and well perfused only in the right lobe. In the experimental animal, initial arterialization using an end-to-end method was much easier and required less retraction. The energy charge and ATP levels dropped sharply during brief warm ischemia but returned rapidly to normal on revascularization. Although the decline in energy charge was less in stored livers, the return to normal was slower and incomplete. Plasma levels of AST indicated much greater damage in the stored livers and were lowest in recipients in unstored livers that were arterialized first. After longer warm ischemia, energy charge values declined and only completely returned to 60% of preoperative values within 2 hr of grafting. Despite this, the survival rate of these animals was very poor and only one survived overnight. Seven of the 12 survived the procedure, but in five death occurred within 30 min of full revascularization. In this group, AST levels rose sharply after revascularization to a mean level of 1,000 U.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-seven (75%) of the patients are still alive 23 to 81 mo after transplantation. Two patients have been diagnosed as having colorectal cancer 11 and 21 mo respectively, after transplantation, for an overall incidence of 5.6% (2 of 36) and a corrected incidence of 6.5% (2 of 31) if the three early deaths and two later deaths caused by cholangiocarcinomas are excluded. It is not known whether colorectal malignancies were present but undetected at the time of transplantation or whether they developed afterward. It is clear that patients who undergo liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with ulcerative colitis should have careful follow-up of the colon, including colonoscopy and multiple biopsies of the colorectal mucosa. Whether proctocolectomy should be considered prophylactically after liver transplantation is an unresolved issue.\r"

And in an increasingly competitive market, hospital affiliation seems to be an advantage. But experts say that word of mouth is the best promotion for weight-loss programs, which means that patients must lose weight and keep the pounds off. That's why hospitals have found that patient education is integral to a successful program.\r"

Group 1 (n = 6) was hyperventilated for four 30-min periods with 1) warm humid air (38-40 degrees C, 100% relative humidity), 2) warm dry air (38-40 degrees C, 0% relative humidity), 3) warm humid air, and 4) warm dry air. After period 2, a loading dose of indomethacin (4 mg/kg iv) was given over 15 min followed by a constant infusion (4 mg.kg-1.h-1). Group 2 (n = 10) was hyperventilated for four 15- to 20-min periods by use of the protocol described above. After period 3 (group 2a) or period 2 (group 2b), topical 4% lidocaine hydrochloride solution was instilled into the trachea and main stem bronchi. Five minutes before the end of each period of hyperventilation, cardiac output and vascular pressures were measured. To determine airway blood flow, differently labeled radioactive microspheres were injected into the left atrium. After the last measurements, dogs were killed and the lungs excised. Blood flow to the trachea, main stem bronchi, and parenchyma (group 1 only) was calculated. Results showed that hyperventilation of dry air produced a significant increase in blood flow to the trachea and bronchi (period 2). In group 1, this increase was attenuated (P less than 0.02) after administration of indomethacin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Subsequently, groups were subdivided into exercise-trained (T) and sedentary (S) groups. Electron microscopy showed subsarcolemmal and intrafibrillar mitochondria in the Fe-T animals to be enlarged with sparse cristae and vacuole-like areas compared with the other groups. An increase in the number of lipid droplets in both Fe- groups was observed. Stereological measurements revealed a 99% increase in the volume occupied by muscle mitochondria in the Fe-T animals (11.9 +/- 0.8%) over the Fe+T (5.9 +/- 0.4%) and Fe+S (6.0 +/- 0.3%) groups and a 55% increase over the Fe-S groups (7.7 +/- 0.3%). The ratio of mitochondrial surface area to tissue volume was significantly decreased only in the Fe-T group. These results indicate that the combined stresses of iron deficiency and training produce mitochondrial ultrastructural changes far greater than those of iron deficiency or training alone. Because this is also the case with the disproportion among mitochondrial enzymes, it is possible that the ultrastructural changes are indicative of morphological responses that maintain ATP turnover during exercise in iron deficiency when oxygen transport and electron transport chain activities are reduced.\r"

Subjects performed arm ergometer exercise (60% peak O2 consumption) to exhaustion after consumption of standard diets (55% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 30% fat; 35 kcal/kg) containing either 100 g of Polycose (placebo, P) or DHAP (3:1, treatment) substituted for a portion of carbohydrate. The two diets were administered in a random order, and each was consumed for a 7-day period. Biopsy of the triceps muscle was obtained immediately before and after exercise. Blood samples were drawn through radial artery and axillary vein catheters at rest, after 60 min of exercise, and at exercise termination. Arm endurance was 133 +/- 20 min after P and 160 +/- 22 min after DHAP (P less than 0.01). Triceps glycogen at rest was 88 +/- 8 (P) and 130 +/- 19 mmol/kg (DHAP) (P less than 0.05). Whole arm arteriovenous glucose difference (mmol/l) was greater (P less than 0.05) for DHAP than P at rest (0.60 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.09) and after 60 min of exercise (1.00 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.11), but it did not differ at exhaustion. Neither respiratory exchange ratio nor respiratory quotient differed between trials at rest, after 60 min of exercise, or at exhaustion. Plasma free fatty acid, glycerol, beta-hydroxybutyrate, catecholamines, and insulin were similar during rest and exercise for both diets. Feeding DHAP for 7 days increased arm muscle glucose extraction before and during exercise, thereby enhancing submaximal arm endurance capacity.\r"

If the lung is reperfused, a syndrome of leukopenia and lung edema occurs. We used the radiolabeled microsphere technique to measure the response of the bronchial circulation in rabbits to acute pulmonary artery occlusion (PAO) and to pulmonary artery reperfusion. We found that the bronchial blood flow (Qbr) decreased from a base line of 0.37 +/- 0.10 to 0.09 +/- 0.04 (SE) ml.min-1.g dry lung-1 (P less than or equal to 0.05) after 4 h of PAO. In a separate group of animals, Qbr 24 h after PAO remained low (0.20 +/- 0.07 ml.min-1.g dry lung-1, P = 0.06). Qbr during PAO was inversely correlated with the wet-to-dry ratio after reperfusion (r = -0.68, P = 0.06). Qbr did not change during 4 h of reperfusion. We speculate that a critical level of Qbr may be necessary during PAO to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury from occurring.\r"

Dry weights of the humeri and radii/ulnae were moderately higher, and the skull and mandible dry and ash weights were significantly higher in suspended than in control rats.

Duration, grade, and speed increased until the rats maintained 1 h/day at 15% grade and either 15 m/min (old rats) or 36 m/min (young rats). Excised bones were mechanically tested with a 3-point flexure test for mechanical properties of force, stress, and strain. Fat-free dry weight (FFW) and moment of inertia were also obtained. With aging, similar increases were observed in both the femur and humerus for FFW, moment of inertia, and force. Ultimate stress was reduced in the senescent femur while strain was elevated; a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the humerus. Irrespective of age, training increased FFW in the femur and, to a lesser degree, in the humerus. Breaking force was elevated for both bones after training. In young and old bones, the training-induced differences in bone mass and force were similar, despite differences in training intensity. In the old trained rats, femur ultimate stress was greater than that in control rat femurs and similar to that in young rat femurs. The results of the present study indicate that training effects were not limited by age.\r"

Base-line conditions were altered by changing posture and the duration of rest preceding the test stimulus. A continuous recording of finger BP was obtained noninvasively by a Finapres. The main observations from this study are with respect to standing up: lengthening the period of preceding rest from 1 to 20 min enlarges the initial BP (systolic/diastolic) decrease (from 8 +/- 10/9 +/- 4 to 27 +/- 8/19 +/- 4 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and the subsequent BP overshoot (from 17 +/- 10/12 +/- 7 to 31 +/- 10/18 +/- 7 mmHg, P less than 0.05); to forced breathing: inspiratory-expiratory changes in BP but not in HR are larger in the upright posture (P less than 0.05); and to the Valsalva maneuver: change in posture from supine to standing increases the phase II BP decrease (from 18 +/- 12/8 +/- 6 to 45 +/- 16/21 +/- 9 mmHg), phase IV systolic BP overshoot (from 26 +/- 16 to 71 +/- 17 mmHg), delta HRmax (from 30 +/- 10 to 47 +/- 12 beats/min), and the Valsalva ratio (HRmax/HRmin), from 2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.6 +/- 0.7, all significant at P less than 0.01.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to determine whether a similar positive transmural pressure gradient, generated by applying a negative pressure at the body surface around the neck, altered upper airway patency. Studies were performed in nine spontaneously breathing anesthetized supine dogs. Airflow was measured with a pneumotachograph mounted on an airtight muzzle placed over the nose and mouth of each animal. Upper airway pressure was measured as the differential pressure between the extrathoracic trachea and the inside of the muzzle. Upper airway resistance was monitored as an index of airway patency. Negative pressure (-2 to -20 cmH2O) was applied around the neck by using a cuirass extending from the jaw to the thorax. In each animal, increasingly negative pressures were transmitted to the airway wall in a progressive, although not linear, fashion. Decreasing the pressure produced a progressive fall in upper airway resistance, without causing a significant change in respiratory drive or respiratory timing. At -5 cmH2O pressure, there occurred a significant fall in upper airway resistance, comparable with the response of a single, intravenous injection of sodium cyanide (0.5-3.0 mg), a respiratory stimulant that produces substantial increases in respiratory drive. We conclude that upper airway resistance is influenced by the transmural pressure across the airway wall and that such a gradient can be accomplished by making the extraluminal pressure more negative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both diet groups of rats were offered isoenergetic diets by a meal-feeding method and were trained by treadmill running. On the final day of the experiment, half of the rats in each diet group were exercised by 2 h of running just before they were killed. The activity state of the enzyme complex was elevated maximally by exercise in liver of rats fed the FAT diet but not in liver of rats fed the CHO diet, suggesting that catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in rat liver during exercise was enhanced by the FAT diet. The activity state of the enzyme complex in muscle was enhanced by exercise in both groups of rats, but a significant difference was not observed between the groups. The concentration of branched-chain amino acids was elevated in liver and muscle by exercise in both groups of rats, but the elevated levels in liver were lower in rats fed the FAT diet than in those fed the CHO diet. Serum branched-chain amino acid concentrations were significantly lower in rested rats fed the FAT diet than in those fed the CHO diet, and the leucine and isoleucine concentrations in the former were elevated by exercise, but the serum concentrations in the latter were not significantly affected by exercise. ATP and ADP concentrations in muscle were not significantly affected by either diet or exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tonic inhibition of some respiratory muscles occurs as part of the generalized muscle atonia of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). A second type of inhibition of the diaphragm during REMS, fractionations, consists of brief pauses in the diaphragmatic electromyogram (DIA EMG) in association with phasic events. Because motor inhibition can occur as part of the startle response, and the brain is highly activated during REMS, we hypothesized that the neural basis of the fractionations might be activation of a startle network. To test this hypothesis, tone bursts (100 dB, 20-ms duration at 15-s intervals) were applied to cats at a fixed inspiratory level in the DIA moving average during REMS, non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS), and wakefulness. Parallel sham studies (no tone applied) were obtained for each state. The response of the DIA EMG was averaged over 100 ms by using the tone pulse as a trigger, and the following parameters of the DIA EMG were measured: latency to peak and/or nadir, increment or decrement in activity, and duration of peak and/or nadir. After a tone, all five animals studied displayed a profound suppression of DIA activity during REMS (latency to nadir 42.4 +/- 10.0 ms, duration of suppression 35.9 +/- 17.6 ms). Similarly, DIA activity was suppressed in all cats during NREMS (latency to nadir 40.9 +/- 13.3 ms, duration 23.9 +/- 13.4 ms). An excitatory response was observed in only two cats during NREMS and wakefulness. The similarity of startle-induced DIA EMG pauses to spontaneous fractionations of DIA activity during REMS suggests that the latter result from activation of a central startle system.\r"

In one, direct muscle stimulation was intermittently superimposed on neural stimulation of the diaphragm, and the relative contribution of NF was estimated by the difference in generated tension. In a second procedure, diaphragm fatigue was induced by using either direct muscle stimulation (with complete blockade of the neuromuscular junction by d-tubocurare) or phrenic nerve stimulation. The relative contribution of NF to diaphragm fatigue was then estimated by comparing the force loss during these two modes of stimulation. With both procedures, it was observed that 1) the relative contribution of NF to diaphragm fatigue was less than 45% at each frequency of phrenic nerve stimulation; 2) the relative contribution of NF to diaphragm fatigue increased at higher rates of phrenic stimulation, reaching a maximum at 75 pulses/s; and 3) the relative contribution of NF to diaphragm fatigue reached a plateau after 2 min of repetitive stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of ventilatory stimulation that accompanies increases in cardiac output is unknown. Previous studies addressing this issue have been inconclusive. However, only steady pulmonary blood flow was used. The effect of flow pulsatility merits consideration, because increasing cardiac output raises not only mean pulmonary arterial pressure but also pulse pressure; mechanoreceptors with an important dynamic component to their responses may cause a response to pulsatile, but not steady, flow. Studies were done on anesthetized cats (n = 4) and dogs (n = 4). The right pulmonary artery was cannulated within the pericardium, and systemic blood was pumped from the left atrium to the right pulmonary artery. The right pulmonary circulation was perfused at different levels of flow, which was either steady or pulsatile. Steady-state flow of up to 150 ml.kg-1.min-1 (270 ml.kg-1.min-1 when corrected for the proportion of lung tissue perfused) did not affect breathing pattern. When high pulmonary flow was made pulsatile (pulse pressure approximately 23 mmHg), breath duration decreased from 3.7 +/- 0.72 to 3.4 +/- 0.81 (SD) s (P less than 0.01), representing a change in frequency of only 9%. There was no change in peak inspiratory activity. It was concluded that pulmonary vascular mechanoreceptors are not likely to contribute significantly to the increase in ventilation in association with increases in cardiac output.\r"

We have now reanalyzed these same casts to quantitate changes in airway length after pneumonectomy. In each cast the distance from each of 120 airways to the terminal bronchiole along its axial pathway was measured. The relationship between the logarithm of this distance and that of the fraction of the lobe subtended by an airway could be described by a quadratic equation with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.85. Subsegmental and more distal airways of postpneumonectomy animals were 33-47% longer than those of controls. Overall the main axial pathway of airways in the left lower lobes was 12% longer in operated animals, but this increase was primarily accounted for by an increase in the length of the more peripheral airways. Central airways were little if any longer in operated animals. After pneumonectomy in weanling ferrets, subsegmental and peripheral airway lengths increase to a greater degree than lung volume and airway cross-sectional area, whereas central airway lengths increase to a lesser extent if at all. The mechanisms responsible for this difference between central and intralobar compensatory airway growth are unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports have shown that immediately after an acute bout of exercise the glucose transport system of rat skeletal muscle plasma membranes is characterized by an increase in both glucose transporter number and intrinsic activity. To determine the duration of the exercise response we examined the time course of these changes after completion of a single bout of exercise. Male rats were exercised on a treadmill for 1 h (20 m/min, 10% grade) or allowed to remain sedentary. Rats were killed either immediately or 0.5 or 2 h after exercise, and red gastrocnemius muscle was used for the preparation of plasma membranes. Plasma membrane glucose transporter number was elevated 1.8- and 1.6-fold immediately and 30 min after exercise, although facilitated D-glucose transport in plasma membrane vesicles was elevated 4- and 1.8-fold immediately and 30 min after exercise, respectively. By 2 h after exercise both glucose transporter number and transport activity had returned to nonexercised control values. Additional experiments measuring glucose uptake in perfused hindquarter muscle produced similar results. We conclude that the reversal of the increase in glucose uptake by hindquarter skeletal muscle after exercise is correlated with a reversal of the increase in the glucose transporter number and activity in the plasma membrane. The time course of the transport-to-transporter ratio suggests that the intrinsic activity response reverses more rapidly than that involving transporter number.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that endotoxin administration to sheep results in host-derived lymph-borne factors that modulate lymphatic pumping activity. To achieve this, two sheep were used for each experiment. In the test animal, a segment of intestinal lymphatic was isolated from all lymph input and provided with lymph from a reservoir. Pumping activity was initiated with a fixed transmural pressure applied to the test vessel, and the only input to this duct was provided by lymph from an indwelling catheter in a second donor sheep. The intravenous administration of endotoxin to the donor animals (33 micrograms/kg) generally resulted in increased pumping in the test vessels over the 1st h, but this was followed by reductions in pumping until flow stopped in all preparations. In control experiments (no endotoxin administered) pumping was unaffected. Further investigation revealed that these activities were relatively unstable and, in the case of the inhibitory material, appeared to act by decreasing the sensitivity of the vessel to changes in transmural pressure, because flow could be reestablished in the test vessels by elevating transmural pressures above the level originally chosen for the experiment. Endotoxin itself had no direct effect on sheep lymphatics in vivo or on bovine lymphatic vessels in vitro. However, the appearance of erythrocyte hemolysate (erythrolysate) in lymph was regularly observed after endotoxin infusion, and we demonstrated that erythrolysate (diluted to contain 10(-5) M hemoglobin) was a potent inhibitor of lymphatic pumping in vivo and in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pairs of small 1-mm piezoelectric transducers were placed in parallel with the muscle fibers in the posterior tracheal wall in seven anesthetized dogs. Length changes were recorded during mechanical ventilation and during complete pressure-volume curves of the lung. The trachealis muscle showed spontaneous fluctuations in base-line length that disappeared after vagotomy. Before vagotomy passive pressure-length curves showed marked hysteresis and length changed by 18.5 +/- 13.2% (SD) resting length at functional residual capacity (LFRC) from FRC to total lung capacity (TLC) and by 28.2 +/- 16.2% LFRC from FRC to residual volume (RV). After vagotomy hysteresis decreased considerably and length now changed by 10.4 +/- 3.7% LFRC from FRC to TLC and by 32.5 +/- 14.6% LFRC from FRC to RV. Bilateral supramaximal vagal stimulation produced a mean maximal active shortening of 28.8 +/- 14.2% resting length at any lung volume (LR) and shortening decreased at lengths above FRC. The mean maximal velocity of shortening was 4.2 +/- 3.9% LR.S-1. We conclude that sonomicrometry may be used to record smooth muscle length in vivo. Vagal tone strongly influences passive length change. In vivo active shortening and velocity of shortening are less than in vitro, implying that there are significant loads impeding shortening in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the role of histamine H3-receptors on neurogenic microvascular leakage in guinea pig airways by measuring extravasation of Evans blue dye. In guinea pig airways the major component of the neurogenic leakage is nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) mediated, due to release of tachykinins. Anesthetized guinea pigs were pretreated with propranolol and atropine to block the beta-adrenergic and cholinergic responses and with mepyramine and cimetidine to block histamine H1- and H2-receptors, respectively. Vagal stimulation significantly increased leakage of dye in trachea (Tr), main bronchi (MB), and central (cIPA) and peripheral intrapulmonary airways (pIPA). The selective H3-receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (alpha-MeHA, 0.3-3 mg/kg iv) did not alter basal leakage but inhibited NANC-mediated leakage in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition of 56.9 (Tr, P less than 0.01), 66.7 (MB, P less than 0.01), 67.5 (cIPA, P less than 0.01), and 58.2% (pIPA, P less than 0.05) at 1 mg/kg. Pretreatment with phentolamine (2.5 mg/kg iv) had no effect on the inhibitory response produced by alpha-MeHA, but the H3-receptor antagonist thioperamide (5 mg/kg ip) blocked its effect. Exogenous substance P (1 microgram/kg iv) caused comparable plasma leakage to NANC-mediated response but was not inhibited by alpha-MeHA. We conclude that H3-agonists inhibit neurogenic leakage by prejunctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from airway sensory nerves.\r"

Smoke injury resulted in an increased lung lymph flow, lymph-to-plasma protein ratio, lung content of polymorphonuclear cells, and extravascular lung water (gravametric), in addition to histological evidence of tissue (pulmonary) edema and destruction. No significant difference was found in these variables between the sheep that were injured with smoke whether or not they were pretreated with allopurinol. The sham-smoked and CO-insufflated animals showed no significant changes in cardiopulmonary function or morphology. We conclude that there are few data to support a role of ischemic reperfusion injury in the pulmonary damage seen after smoke inhalation.\r"

Lungs perfused with either albumin alone, PMN, or MN but not stimulated with PMA showed no change in vascular resistance or endothelial permeability measured as the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c). Lungs that were stimulated with PMA with no cells showed no change in Kf,c (0.34 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.7), but vascular resistance increased in all segments of the circulation. Capillary pressure, the major force responsible for edema formation, nearly doubled in the absence of cells 40 min after PMA. Lungs perfused with either PMN or MN and stimulated with PMA were injured. Kf,c increased from 0.41 +/- 0.03 to 0.87 +/- 0.10 (PMN) and from 0.36 +/- 0.07 to 0.81 +/- 0.23 (MN) 90 min after PMA. In addition to the increased endothelial permeability, vascular resistances and pressures also increased in the cell-perfused PMA-stimulated lungs. These results demonstrate that cells other than granulocytes are capable of producing severe acute lung injury and cannot be ignored when the effects of PMA on neutrophil-depleted lungs are studied.\r"

Eighteen female Sprague-Dawley rats that would not perform on a treadmill as part of another study were used to measure VO2 as a function of laddermill speed (5-17 m/min). Data were obtained from all 18 rats; VO2 increased linearly as a function of laddermill speed (r = 0.83, y = 3.0 x + 63.2). Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats that also refused to run on a treadmill were used to measure mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and blood flow distribution (with microspheres) during climbing at 5 and 10 m/min. These exercise intensities were metabolically equivalent to level treadmill running at 45 and 60 m/min (VO2 approximately 78 and 93 ml.min-1.kg-1, respectively). Of the 24 animals, 23 were willing to climb. Mean arterial pressures were higher (approximately 10%) during laddermill climbing than during equivalent treadmill running, but heart rates were the same. General blood flow distribution among muscles as a function of fiber type (with red muscles receiving higher flows) and between muscles and visceral tissues (muscle blood flow increased as a function of exercise intensity while visceral blood flows decreased) were similar to data for rats running on the level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One group of male Sprague-Dawley rats was administered tobacco smoke from low-nicotine cigarettes (group A, 1 mg/cigarette) for 4-6 wk, while a second group (B) served as a sham control by receiving only puffs of room air. Reflex adjustments in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after bilateral common carotid occlusion (BCCO) were compared between the two groups. In the anesthetized control state, no significant difference existed for the cardiovascular parameters measured in the two groups. However, MAP increases after BCCO were significantly greater in the smoke-treated animals (P less than 0.05) compared with the sham-treated group. At 10, 20, 30, and 40 s after BCCO, MAP increases above preocclusion values were 66, 45, 42, and 38% for group A and 35, 26, 24, and 22% for group B, respectively. Additionally, the time required to reach maximum MAP after BCCO was significantly less (P less than 0.05) for the smoke-treated vs. sham-treated animals (8.5 +/- 0.2s for group A, 11.2 +/- 0.3s for group B). MAP changes during BCCO were significantly different (P less than 0.05) between the treatment groups after cervical vagotomy. It is concluded that chronic tobacco smoke exposure in experimental animals for periods as short as 4-6 wk alters the reflex regulation of the cardiovascular system.\r"

Pulmonary arterial injections of LTC4 caused dose-related increases in pulmonary arterial pressure during perfusion with physiological salt solution containing Ficoll (4 g/dl). FPL55712 caused concentration-related inhibition of the pressor response to LTC4 (0.6 micrograms). Although 10 micrograms/ml FPL55712 inhibited the LTC4 pressor response by 61%, it did not alter the response to hypoxia. At 100 microgram/ml, FPL55712 inhibited the responses to LTC4 and hypoxia by 73 and 71%, respectively, but also attenuated the vasoconstrictor responses to prostaglandin F2 alpha (78% at 8 micrograms), phenylephrine (68% at 100 micrograms), and KCl (51% at 40 mM). At 0.5 microgram/ml, indomethacin significantly attenuated the pressor response to arachidonic acid but did not alter responses to LTC4 or hypoxia. These results suggest that in isolated ferret lungs 1) the vasoconstrictor response to LTC4 did not depend on release of cyclooxygenase products and 2) LTC4 did not mediate hypoxic vasoconstriction.\r"

This is the first report of a fatigue test having been applied to masseter motor units in either animals or humans. The human masseter was found to be comprised predominantly of fast-twitch motor units with a broad spectrum of fatigability. Very few physiological type S units were found, despite histochemical evidence for a substantial population of type I fibers in the masseter. In addition, there was no significant correlation between fatigability and either twitch amplitude or contractile speed in the motor units studied. The latter observations are consistent with the unusual histological features of the masseter. Comparison with other human fatigue data suggests that the extent of fatigue in the present population of masseter motor units after approximately 3,000 activations is similar to that reported for populations of units in first dorsal interosseous and medial gastrocnemius.\r"

A second group (4 men, 4 women) trained one leg for E and the other leg for E and S (E+S). E training consisted of five 3-min bouts on a cycle ergometer at a power output corresponding to that requiring 90-100% of oxygen uptake during maximal exercise (VO2 max). S training consisted of six sets of 15-20 repetitions with the heaviest possible weight on a leg press (combined hip and knee extension) weight machine. Training was done 3 days/wk for 22 wk. Needle biopsy samples from vastus lateralis were taken before and after training and were examined for histochemical, biochemical, and ultrastructural adaptations. The nominal S and E training programs were \"hybrids\", having more similarities as training stimuli than differences; thus S made increases (P less than 0.05) similar to those of S+E in E-related measures of VO2max (S, S+E: 8%, 8%), repetitions with the pretraining maximal single leg press lift [1 repetition maximum (RM)] (27%, 24%), and percent of slow-twitch fibers (15%, 8%); and S made significant, although smaller, increases in repetitions with 80% 1 RM (81%, 152%) and citrate synthase (CS) activity (22%, 51%). Similarly, E increased knee extensor area [computed tomography (CT) scans] as much as E+S (14%, 21%) and made significant, although smaller, increases in leg press 1 RM (20%, 34%) and thigh girth (3.4%, 4.8%). When a presumably stronger stimulus for an adaptation was added to a weaker one, some additive effects occurred (i.e., increases in 1 RM and thigh girth that were greater in E+S than E; increases in CS activity and repetitions with 80% 1 RM that were greater in S+E than S). When a weaker, although effective, stimulus was added to a stronger one, addition generally did not occur. Concurrent S and E training did not interfere with S or E development in comparison to S or E training alone.\r"

Plasma clearance rate also did not change significantly, averaging 7.9 +/- 2.9, 7.9 +/- 3.8, and 9.0 +/- 5.9 ml.min-1.kg-1 in the fetus, after simulated birth, and in the newborn lamb, respectively, kd also was not altered measurably and averaged 0.020 +/- 0.006, 0.024 +/- 0.007, and 0.019 +/- 0.007 min-1 during the same time periods. Similar results were obtained by using three widely different amounts of infused glycerol. The results indicate that removal of glycerol does not depend on placental function to an appreciable extent. It is concluded that plasma glycerol concentration reflects principally glycerol turnover and, hence, lipolysis before and after birth.\r"

In the present study, measurements were made of the BAL-to-plasma concentration ratios of a variety of solutes in an anesthetized rat model. One minute after an intravenous injection of labeled Na+ and urea, 5 ml of isotonic mannitol, saline, or glucose were injected into the trachea and an initial aliquot of the BAL was immediately removed. Initial BAL-to-plasma concentration ratios of urea, Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, and total protein were similar (ranging from 0.013 to 0.017) after BAL with mannitol, but albumin and transferrin ratios were approximately 60% lower and K+ ratios were five times greater. Lavage with saline yielded BAL-to-plasma urea concentration ratios similar to those obtained with mannitol lavage. The BAL-to-plasma specific activity of urea was about twice that of Na+, indicating that urea diffused into the ELF more rapidly than Na+ during the 70 s that elapsed between the time the radioactive urea and Na+ were injected into the circulation and the time when lavage was complete. Subsequent lavage samples also indicated that urea rapidly diffuses into the fluid-filled lungs. These experiments suggest that isotonic mannitol may be a useful solution for lavage, because it allows use of Na+ and perhaps Cl- as additional indicators of ELF dilution by BAL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The hypothesis tested in the present study was that the more abrupt decrease in mouth pressure produced by midinspiratory occlusion will be associated with evoked potentials that have shorter peak latencies and greater peak amplitudes than those produced by occlusions from the onset of inspiration. The second objective of the present study was to determine whether there is bilateral projection of inputs from the respiratory system to the somatosensory cortex. Random presentation of 64 midinspiratory occlusions and 64 occlusions from the onset of inspiration was performed in eight subjects. The inspirations preceding the occlusions served as control. Evoked potentials were recorded from the scalp with electrode pairs Cz-C3 and Cz-C4. Reaction time to each type of occlusion was measured from the burst in electromyogram activity produced by contraction of the muscles encircling the eye. Each type of inspiratory occlusion was associated with evoked potentials that could be recorded bilaterally. The peak amplitudes of the evoked potentials recorded over the right cerebral hemisphere were significantly greater than those recorded from the left side. The peak amplitude was greater and the peak latency shorter for the evoked potentials produced by the midinspiratory occlusions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that afferents mediating these potentials are stimulated by added loads to breathing and project bilaterally to the somatosensory cortex in humans.\r"

Before and after training, intracellular pH and the ratio of inorganic phosphate to phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) were measured by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Also maximal O2 consumption (VO2 max), muscle mass, and forearm blood flow were determined by graded systemic exercise, magnetic resonance imaging, and venous occlusion plethysmography, respectively. Blood flow, Pi/PCr, and pH were measured in both forearms at rest and during submaximal wrist flexion at 5, 23, and 46 J/min. Training did not affect VO2 max, exercise blood flow, or muscle mass. Resting pH, Pi/PCr, and blood flow were also unchanged. After training, the ND forearm demonstrated significantly lower Pi/PCr at 23 and 46 J/min. Endurance, measured as the number of contractions to exhaustion, also was increased significantly (63%) after training in the ND forearm. We conclude that 1) forearm training results in a lower Pi/PCr at identical submaximal work loads; 2) this improvement is independent of changes in VO2 max, muscle mass, or limb blood flow; and 3) these differences are associated with improved endurance and may reflect improved oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle.\r"

The effects of these peptides on resting ventilation and on ventilatory responses to hypoxia and to hypercapnia have been investigated in six normal humans. Infusions of substance P (1 pmol.kg-1.min-1) and of VIP (6 pmol.kg-1.min-1) were compared with placebo and with nitroprusside (5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) as a control for the hypotensive action of the peptides. Both peptides caused significantly less hypotension than nitroprusside. Substance P and nitroprusside caused significantly greater increases in ventilation and in the hypoxic ventilatory response than VIP. No changes were seen in hypercapnic sensitivity. The stimulation of ventilation and the differential effects on ventilatory chemosensitivity that accompanied hypotension are consistent either with stimulation of carotid body chemoreceptor activity or with an interaction with peripheral chemoreceptor input to the respiratory center, as is seen in animals. The similar cardiovascular but different ventilatory effects of the peptides suggest that substance P may also stimulate the carotid body in a manner independent of the effect of hypotension. This is consistent with a role of substance P in the hypoxic ventilatory response in humans.\r"

Ventilatory responses were measured under three conditions: control (C) and after ingestion of either 650 mg caffeine (CF) or placebo (P) in a double-blind randomized manner. None of the physiological variables of interest differed significantly for C and P conditions (P greater than 0.05). Caffeine levels during HCVR, HVR, and EVR were 69.5 +/- 11.8, 67.8 +/- 10.8, and 67.8 +/- 10.9 (SD) mumol/l, respectively (P greater than 0.05). Metabolic rate at rest and during exercise was significantly elevated during CF compared with P. An increase in VE from 7.4 +/- 2.5 (P) to 10.5 +/- 2.1 l/min (CF) (P less than 0.05) was associated with a decrease in end-tidal PCO2 from 39.1 +/- 2.7 (P) to 35.1 +/- 1.3 Torr (CF) (P less than 0.05). Caffeine increased the HCVR, HVR, and EVR slopes (mean increase: 28 +/- 8, 135 +/- 28, 14 +/- 5%, respectively) compared with P; P less than 0.05 for each response. Increases in resting ventilation, HCVR, and HVR slopes were associated with increases in tidal volume (VT), whereas the increase in EVR slope was accompanied by increases in both VT and respiratory frequency. Our results indicate that caffeine increases VE and chemosensitivity to CO2 inhalation, hypoxia, and CO2 production during exercise below the AT.\r"

Left knee extensors showed a 107% increase in 1 RM, a 10% increase in isokinetic strength at 60 degrees/s, and a 23% increase in total work performed during 25 contractions on an isokinetic dynamometer. Strength measurements of the untrained left elbow extensors showed no change. Leg cycle ergometer VO2max per unit fat-free mass increased by an average 1.9 ml (P = 0.034) whereas arm cycle VO2max was unchanged. Pulmonary function, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte volume, plasma volume, and total blood volume did not change. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis showed a 28% increase in mean fiber area, no change in fiber type distribution, a 15% increase in capillaries per fiber, and a 38% increase in citrate synthase activity. The data suggest that the small increase in leg cycle VO2max in older men may be due to adaptations in oxidative capacity and increased mass of the strength-trained muscles.\r"

Muscle atrophy was induced by 15 days of hindlimb suspension. Suspension resulted in a decrease of maximal tension relative to an important decline in fiber diameter. Ca affinity of the contractile proteins was not changed insofar as the tension-pCa relationship was not shifted along the pCa axis. However, after hindlimb suspension 1) the value of the Hill coefficient from the tension-pCa curve was found to be higher, 2) a higher Ca threshold for activation was reported, and 3) a significant increase in contraction kinetics was described. All these results suggested that after suspension the mechanical properties of the slow-twitch soleus appeared to resemble more closely those of a fast-twitch muscle. Our results were in complete agreement with published histochemical data.\r"

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of electrical stimulation on the TG content in the isolated intact rat flexor digitorum brevis skeletal muscle preparation by use of two different stimulation protocols. Muscles were electrically stimulated for 1 h either continuously at 1 Hz or intermittently (30 s on, 60 s off) at 5 Hz while incubated in 21 degrees C Krebs bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) that contained 11 mM glucose. Control muscles were either frozen immediately after excision or incubated for 1 h. TG content was significantly decreased (P less than 0.05) compared with control concentrations in both stimulated muscle groups, with the greatest reduction (60%) occurring after 5-Hz intermittent stimulation. These data indicate that intramuscular TG is hydrolyzed in response to electrical stimulation in the isolated flexor digitorum brevis muscle preparation. In addition, the type of stimulation (higher frequency intermittent vs. lower frequency continuous) employed influences the amount of intracellular TG hydrolyzed.\r"

During phrenic nerve stimulation or direct stimulation of the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm in an animal with the chest and abdomen open, Pim invariably increased and a linear relationship between Pim and the force exerted on the central tendon was found (r greater than or equal to 0.93). During quiet inspiration Pim in general decreased in the costal part (-3.9 +/- 3.3 cmH2O), whereas it either increased or slightly decreased in the crural part (+3.3 +/- 9.4 cmH2O, P less than 0.05). Similar differences were obtained during loaded and occluded inspiration. After bilateral phrenicotomy Pim invariably decreased during inspiration in both parts (costal -4.3 +/- 6.4 cmH2O, crural -3.1 +/- 0.6 cmH2O). Contrary to the expected changes in tension in the muscle, but in conformity with the pressure applied to the muscle, Pim invariably increased during passive inflation from functional residual capacity to total lung capacity (costal +30 +/- 23 cmH2O, crural +18 +/- 18 cmH2O). Similarly, during passive deflation from functional residual capacity to residual volume, Pim invariably decreased (costal -12 +/- 19 cmH2O, crural -12 +/- 14 cmH2O). In two experiments similar observations were made with saline-filled catheters. We conclude that although Pim increases during contraction as in other muscles, Pim during respiratory maneuvers is primarily determined by the pleural and abdominal pressures applied to the muscle rather than by the tension developed by it.\r"

Testing included lower body negative pressure administered during chloralose-urethan anesthesia and graded doses of sympathomimetic agents (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and tyramine) administered to conscious unrestrained animals. Both HDS and HOZ were associated with a small decrease in the hypotensive response to lower body negative pressure. The HOZ group, but not the HDS group, exhibited augmented reflex tachycardia. Furthermore, both HDS and HOZ groups manifested reduced pressor responses to phenylephrine after treatment. These reductions were associated with significantly attenuated increases in mesenteric vascular resistance. However, baroreflex control of heart rate was not altered by the treatment conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that 9 days of HDS in rats does not elicit hemodynamic response patterns generally associated with cardiovascular deconditioning induced by hypogravic conditions.\r"

With bronchodilation the increase in maximal flow on the partial flow-volume curve (P), initiated from functional residual capacity, exceeded that seen on the maximal curve (M), initiated from total lung capacity, such that isovolumic maximal flows diminished after a deep inhalation; i.e., M/P ratios fell with bronchodilation, as we and others have found. Five of eight reversed this downward trend in M/P ratios at higher cumulative doses. Quasistatic pressure-volume curves (QSPV) were simultaneously performed on two of these five and demonstrated a decrease in pressure-volume hysteresis (PVH) at the higher doses associated with a rising M/P ratio. Three of eight had continuing low and diminishing M/P ratio up to the highest dose given. QSPV were performed in two of these three and indicated no change in PVH at any of the doses. One of these two had a repeat study using a subcutaneous beta-agonist after the inhaled drug was given, and the M/P ratio rose as QSPV PVH fell. These data support the relative hysteresis analysis of airway and parenchyma as an explanation for volume history effects on airway caliber.\r"

Neutrophil activation and/or xanthine oxidase-mediated purine degradation may cause toxic oxygen metabolite production and lung injury. We investigated whether circulating blood elements are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion lung injury. Isolated rat lungs were perfused with physiological salt solution (PSS) stabilized with Ficoll until circulating blood elements were not detected in the lung effluent. Lungs were then rendered ischemic by stopping ventilation and perfusion for 45 min at room temperature. Lung injury occurred and was quantitated by the accumulation of 125I-bovine serum albumin into lung parenchyma and alveolar lavage fluid during reperfusion. Lung injury occurred, in the absence of circulating blood elements, when ischemic lungs were reperfused with PSS-Ficoll solution alone. Reperfusion with whole blood or PSS-Ficoll supplemented with human or rat neutrophils did not increase lung injury. Furthermore, during lung ischemia, the presence of neutrophils did not enhance injury. Experiments using PSS-albumin perfusate and quantitating lung injury by permeability-surface area product yielded similar results. Microvascular pressures were not different and could not account for the results. Toxic O2 metabolites were involved in the injury because addition of erythrocytes or catalase to the perfusate attenuated the injury. Thus reperfusion after lung ischemia causes injury that is dependent on a nonneutrophil source of toxic O2 metabolites.\r"

The frequency response characteristics of standard pneumotachometer/pressure transducers (PPT) limit their use to relatively low frequencies. Also, the frequency response of PPTs has been reported to be \"load\" dependent. Thus, the frequency response characteristics measured under \"no-load\" conditions, which theoretically could be used to compensate subsequent measurements, may not be appropriate for measurements made under loaded conditions. Another method of measuring impedance exists which depends on a reference impedance element other than a pneumotachometer. In this method, an oscillatory flow signal with known amplitude is generated and used to force the system being tested. Unlike PPTs, this oscillatory flow generator (OFG) is a closed system that allows measurements to be made only during breath holding. Our objective was to determine whether the frequency response of a PPT could be compensated using measurements made under no-load conditions, such that it accurately measured an impedance load. The frequency response of the PPT under no-load conditions was measured by the OFG and used to compensate the output of the PPT in subsequent impedance measurements. The compensated PPT was used to measure the impedance of a mechanical structure and the impedances of four human subjects. The impedances of the mechanical structure and the subjects were also measured using the OFG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The increases in RT were associated with proportional increases in skeletal muscle vascular resistance. Thus, in isolated rat hindquarters, increasing the duration of ischemia results in progressive increases in the permeability to plasma proteins (decreased sigma) and RT, which are associated primarily with skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of spontaneous running activity on maximal O2 consumption (VO2max), running performance, and submaximal O2 consumption (VO2submax, running economy) was studied in rats to determine whether this exercise mode can produce significant training adaptations. Twenty male Long-Evans rats (300 +/- 20 g) were housed in spontaneous activity running wheels, and after 8 wk they were divided into high-, average-, and low-performing groups according to the average spontaneous running distance and tested for maximal running performance, VO2max, and VO2submax. The average-performing rats ran 52% longer than the control rats (P less than 0.01) and 19% longer than the low-performing rats (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in maximum running time to exhaustion between the average- and high-performing rats. The low-performing rats ran 28% longer than the control rats (P less than 0.05). The VO2max of the average-performing rats was 12% greater than in the control rats (P less than 0.01). There were no differences in VO2max between either low-performing and control rats or between average- and high-performing rats. Although the VO2submax was not different between low-, average-, and high-performing rats, in all three groups it was lower than in the control rats (P less than 0.01). Accordingly, we recommend that only those Long-Evans rats that, on average, spontaneously run greater than 11.6 km/wk for a minimum of 8 wk be considered to have undergone a training effect. Rats that perform poorly can be identified as early as 2 wk after the start of training.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of the gas exchange sampling interval on variability and plateau in O2 uptake (VO2), 10 subjects underwent steady-state treadmill exercise at 50% maximal VO2 and 6 subjects underwent maximal testing using a ramp protocol. During steady-state exercise, gas exchange data were acquired by using 10 different sampling intervals. The variability in VO2 was greater as the sampling interval shortened (SD = 4.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 for breath-by-breath vs. 0.8 ml.kg-1.min-1 for 60-s samples). The breath-by-breath data suggested a Gaussian distribution, and most of the variability was attributable to tidal volume (51%). During ramp testing, the slope of the change in VO2 (for each sample) was regressed with time. Considerable variability in the slopes was observed throughout exercise, and in each subject the slopes varied about zero, demonstrating both positive and negative values throughout submaximal effort. These observations were made despite the use of large sampling intervals. Shortening the sample resulted in even greater variability. We conclude that 1) the sampling interval can have a major impact on gas exchange data during exercise and 2) considerable variability exists in the slope of the change in VO2 with a consistent change in external work regardless of the sample used, suggesting that a plateau (defined as the slope of a VO2 sample at peak exercise that does not differ significantly from a slope of zero) in VO2 is not a reliable physiological marker for maximal effort.\r"

The effects of minor neck surgery on tracheal CBF in eight barbiturate-anesthetized eucapnically ventilated beagles were investigated. Each dog underwent two studies. Measurements of CBF were made at 1-min intervals on the right lateral midtracheal surface by means of heterodyne mode correlation analysis laser light scattering. In the control study, CBF was measured in each dog for at least 160 min. In the incision study, base-line CBF was measured for at least 40 min. The overlying sternohyoidus muscles were then separated, and a longitudinal 2- to 3-cm incision was made in the trachea caudally from the fourth to the fifth cartilage ring. CBF was measured at least 5 cm distally from the site of tracheal injury for an additional 120 min. Electrocardiogram, rectal temperature, tracheal pressure, exhaled CO2, and arterial blood pressure, PO2, PCO2, and pH remained stable throughout both studies. The mean base-line CBF was 4.7 +/- 0.4 Hz. It increased to 19.5 +/- 2.9 Hz (P less than 0.0001) 100 min after the incision and remained elevated until the end of the study period (P less than 0.0001). The mechanism(s) causing this stimulation may also be responsible for the high \"basal\" CBF observed in other studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the relationship between the appearance of paraxanthine (caffeine's major dimethylxanthine metabolite) and free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization after intravenous caffeine administration, 10 men were studied at rest after receiving a dose of 4 mg/kg lean body mass. Venous blood samples were obtained before dosing and at minutes 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. Serum levels of FFA, glycerol, caffeine, and paraxanthine were determined in duplicate. Concentrations of FFA and glycerol were corrected for plasma volume changes. A high negative correlation was seen between decreases in caffeine and increases in FFA (r = -0.90) and a high positive correlation was seen between the appearance of paraxanthine and FFA (r = 0.93). It was concluded that paraxanthine may play a role in increased lipolysis after caffeine administration in humans.\r"

Relative to group V2 (its age and weight-matched control group), group F showed a greater decrease of muscle mass in SOL (23%) than in EDL (11%). In SOL a decrease in the percentage of type I fibers was counterbalanced by a simultaneous increase in type IIa fibers. The cross-sectional area of type I fiber was reduced by 24%. No statistically significant difference in capillarization and enzymatic activities was observed between the groups. In EDL a reduction in type I fiber distribution and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase activity (27%) occurred after the flight. The small histochemical and biochemical changes reported suggest the interest in studying muscular adaptation during a flight of longer duration.\r"

The rats were placed in a direct calorimeter where the air temperature was maintained at 24 degrees C for the initial 3 h. IH was then made for 30 min through an electric heater implanted chronically (6.5 W.kg-1) in the peritoneal cavity, and EW was performed by raising the jacket water temperature surrounding the calorimeter from 24 to 39 degrees C (0.19 degrees C.min-1). Hypothalamic (Thy) and colonic temperature immediately before the start of the heat load tended to be higher as the acclimation temperature increased. During IH, the threshold Thy for the tail skin vasodilation (Tth) was significantly higher in H2 than in Cn rats. During EW, however, there was no difference in Tth between the groups. Metabolic heat production (M) was slightly suppressed during IH and significantly depressed only in H2 rats. During EW, M was suppressed in all the groups. The magnitude and duration of suppression were greater in H2 rats than in the other two groups. The responses in nonevaporative heat loss and thermal conductance (C) to the rise in Thy did not differ among the three groups during IH. According to the rise in Thy, however, there was a greater C increase in H2 than in Cn and H1 rats during EW.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The heat acclimation of the rats was attained through exposure to Ta of 33 or 36 degrees C for 5 h daily during 15 consecutive days. Control rats were kept at Ta of 24 degrees C for the same acclimation period. Heat acclimation lowered the body core temperature at Ta of 24 degrees C, and the core temperature level was lowered as acclimation temperature increased. When heat was applied by direct body heating, the threshold hypothalamic temperature (Thy) for the tail skin vasodilation was also lower in heat-acclimated rats than in the control rats. However, the amount of increase in Thy from the resting level to the threshold was the same in all three groups. When heat was applied by indirect warming, threshold Thy was slightly higher in heat-acclimated than in control rats. The amount of increase in Thy from the resting level to the threshold was significantly greater in heat-acclimated rats. In addition, Ta and the skin temperature at the onset of skin vasodilation were significantly higher in heat-acclimated rats. The results indicate that heat-acclimated rats were less sensitive to the increase in skin temperature in terms of threshold Thy. The gain constant of nonevaporative heat loss response was assessed by plotting total thermal conductance against Thy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The experiments were conducted during the summer in rooms in which ambient temperature was 28-32 degrees C or 35 degrees C. The nine healthy male subjects were wearing summer clothes. Finger BF through vessels located deep in the skin was measured by using laser-Doppler flowmetry (ALF-2100, Advance). With the use of a tungsten microelectrode SSA was recorded directly from the median nerve at the wrist or antecubital fossa of the tested arm. With finger vessels already dilated at Tw of 35 or 37 degrees C, finger BF decreased, with a concomitant increase in the SSA bursts as Tw rose to 39-41 degrees C. We confirmed in one subject that anesthetic blockade of the median nerve at the site proximal, but not distal, to the recording site blocked responses to the step rise in Tw in the SSA bursts and in finger BF. From these results we conclude that, with the subject in a warm state, blood vessels of the finger respond to local heating with vasoconstriction, and this finger vasoconstriction is evoked reflexively, largely through the increased sympathetic outflow to the resistance vessels of the finger.\r"

  ".W": "Subpleural concentrations of He and SF6 were measured during multiple-breath washouts from isolated dog lungs. Tidal volume, inspiratory flow, and frequency were in the normal range of canine ventilation. For each gas, there was a local minimum in concentration during inspiration (Cinsp) and a local maximum in concentration during exhalation (Cexp). SF6 exhibited a deeper inspiratory trough than He for each breath of every washout. For large tidal volumes (10-20 ml/kg), Cexp approximated a single exponential decay and He was cleared more rapidly than SF6. For small tidal volumes (2.5 ml/kg), Cexp was multiexponential and SF6 was cleared more rapidly than He. Cinsp/Cexp (a measure of the depth of the inspiratory trough) and the kinetics of Cexp decay were determined for washouts using a tidal volume of 10 and 20 ml/kg and different inspiratory flows. Under all conditions, an increase of inspiratory flow resulted in a deeper inspiratory trough for both He and SF6. For washouts using 10 ml/kg and 60 breaths/min, an increase of inspiratory flow increased the clearance of both gases. In washouts using lower ventilatory frequencies, gas clearance was independent of inspiratory flow. These findings are contrary to predictions of contemporary models of convection and diffusion in the lung. This study suggests that convective axial mixing and radial diffusion in the airways are important determinants of pulmonary gas transport.\r"

Four staff orthopaedists and one physical therapist measured eight radiographs that showed scoliosis and twenty that showed kyphosis. The measurements were made on two occasions and in random order. For scoliosis, the average difference between readings was 3.8 degrees, and 95 per cent of the differences were 8 degrees or less (range, 0 to 10 degrees). These findings were in keeping with those of other published reports. For kyphosis, the average difference between readings was 3.3 degrees, and 95 per cent of the differences were 7 degrees or less (range, 0 to 30 degrees). One investigator rated the kyphosis radiographs with respect to clarity. There was a trend to less variation with clearer radiographs, but this was not significant. The end-vertebrae were pre-selected for some radiographs and were freely chosen by the interpreter for others. Reliability was not significantly improved when the end-vertebrae of the curve had been pre-selected. Using the statistical method called tolerance limits, we determined that if one were to be 95 per cent confident that a measured difference represented a true change, the difference would have to be 10 degrees for scoliosis radiographs and 11 degrees for kyphosis radiographs. The probability that a measured difference is due to measurement error alone (that is, a false-positive reading) was calculated.\r"

We concluded that the complications do not preclude use of this procedure.\r"

The patients were followed for an average of nine years and six months, the longest follow-up being seventeen years. A good result was seen in twenty-nine elbows; a fair result, in one; and a poor result, in seven. The reasons for the poor results were gross posterior displacement of the humeral component in five elbows, persistent subluxation with pain in one, and recurrent ankylosis in one. Of the five elbows that had gross posterior displacement, four had a revision operation with a new humeral component, and a satisfactory result was eventually achieved. Radiographic examination revealed various degrees of proximal subsidence of the humeral component in 70 per cent of the elbows. However, in most of the elbows the subsidence was not progressive and was compatible with a good clinical result. In contrast, the rate of loosening of the ulnar component was low; loosening was seen in only 5 per cent of the elbows. Seventeen elbows were followed for ten years or more, and comparison of the clinical results in the intermediate period with those at the most recent review revealed that the results improved with time. Because of the number of elbows in which subsidence of the humeral component developed, we now use a humeral component with an intramedullary stem, and were no longer recommend the use of our Type-1 and Type-2 prostheses.\r"

  ".W": "Relative stretching of the cauda equina over the posterosuperior border of the sacrum can be found in all patients who have Grade-III or IV spondylolisthesis at the lumbosacral junction. We identified twelve patients, all less than eighteen years old, who had cauda equina syndrome after in situ arthrodesis for Grade-III or IV lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. In all twelve patients, posterolateral arthrodesis had been done bilaterally through a midline or paraspinal muscle-splitting approach. Nothing in the operative reports suggested that the cauda equina had been directly injured during any of the procedures. Five of the twelve patients eventually recovered completely. The remaining seven patients had a permanent residual neurological deficit, manifested by complete or partial inability to control the bowel and bladder. If dysfunction of the root of the sacral nerve is noted preoperatively in a patient who has lumbosacral spondylolisthesis, decompression of the cauda equina concomitant with the arthrodesis should be considered. An acute cauda equina syndrome that follows a seemingly uneventful in situ arthrodesis for spondylolisthesis is best treated by an immediate decompression that includes resection of the posterosuperior rim of the dome of the sacrum and the adjacent intervertebral disc. In addition, posterior insertion of instrumentation and reduction of the lumbosacral spondylolisthesis should be considered.\r"

We assessed the month when the patient was seen and the implied time of onset of the slip and found a statistically significant variation for both. The average time of onset was mid-June, with a standard deviation of 2.5 months, and was not significantly different for race, sex, or laterality. We attributed the increased incidence of slipped capital femoral epiphysis during the summer to increased physical activity in that season.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of concurrent injury to the anterior cruciate ligament on the healing of injuries of the medial collateral ligament was studied in dogs. In Group I, isolated transection of the medial collateral ligament was performed; in Group II, transection of the medial collateral ligament with partial transection of the anterior cruciate ligament; and in Group III, complete transection of both the medial collateral ligament and the anterior cruciate ligament. The three groups of animals were examined six and twelve weeks postoperatively with respect to varus-valgus rotation of the knee and tensile properties of the femur-medial collateral ligament-tibia complex. The varus-valgus rotation of the knee was found to be the largest in Group-III specimens at all time-periods and was 3.5 times greater than the control values at twelve weeks. Group-I and Group-II specimens also showed large varus-valgus rotations at time zero, but the rotations returned to the control values by twelve weeks. For the structural properties of the femur-medial collateral ligament-tibia complex, the values for ultimate load for Groups I and II reached the control values by twelve weeks, while that for Group III remained at only 80 per cent of the control value. Both energy absorbed at failure and linear stiffness for all three groups were less than those for the controls at six weeks, and only linear stiffness returned to the control values by twelve weeks. For the mechanical (material) properties of the healed ligament substance, the values for modulus and tensile strength were markedly lower than the control values for all groups at six weeks. By twelve weeks, the tensile strength of Group-I specimens had increased to 52 per cent of the control value, while those of Groups II and III were only 45 and 14 per cent, respectively. Our results demonstrate that healing of the transected medial collateral ligament is adversely affected by concomitant transection of the anterior cruciate ligament. Both varus-valgus rotation and mechanical properties of the healed ligament failed to recover in knees that had combined transection of the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments. The structural properties of the femur-medial collateral ligament-tibia complex in tension recovered more rapidly as a consequence of the large mass of reparative tissue that formed in the medial collateral ligament of the anterior cruciate-deficient knees.\r"

About one-third of the subjects were found to have a substantial abnormality. Of those who were less than sixty years old, 20 per cent had a herniated nucleus pulposus and one had spinal stenosis. In the group that was sixty years old or older, the findings were abnormal on about 57 per cent of the scans: 36 per cent of the subjects had a herniated nucleus pulposus and 21 per cent had spinal stenosis. There was degeneration or bulging of a disc at at least one lumbar level in 35 per cent of the subjects between twenty and thirty-nine years old and in all but one of the sixty to eighty-year-old subjects. In view of these findings in asymptomatic subjects, we concluded that abnormalities on magnetic resonance images must be strictly correlated with age and any clinical signs and symptoms before operative treatment is contemplated.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance images of the leg were made preoperatively to show the vascular anatomy in twenty-nine patients (thirty-five legs) who were between the ages of fourteen and forty-one years and in whom we planned to use the fibula as a vascular graft. The fibula was harvested as a graft in thirty-two legs, and this allowed us to compare the images with the anatomical findings at operation. In these thirty-two legs, the branching pattern, the measured distance to the bifurcation of the peroneal artery, and all vascular anomalies in the area were accurately detected. No graft was taken from the other three legs. We recommend that imaging of the vascular anatomy of the leg be done before using the fibula as a vascular graft in order to detect the precise point of origin of the peroneal artery from the posterior tibial artery, to estimate the length of the vascular pedicle, and to evaluate the role of the three major vessels in supplying blood to the leg. All these aims can be accomplished with the aid of angiography, but we have found that gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS) magnetic-resonance imaging is more cost-effective and is associated with less morbidity. It is not adequate for older patients who have arterial stenosis or atherosclerosis or for patients who have some other underlying vascular disease. Metallic hardware may cause artefacts that obscure the vascular anatomy.\r"

At the same time, in ten of these patients the tendon of the brachioradialis was transferred to the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus, and in the eleventh patient the brachioradialis tendon was transferred to the tendon of the flexor digitorum superficialis of the small finger, to restore pinch. The average time between injury and operation was thirty-four months. The average length of follow-up after operation was thirty-four months. Ten patients gained functional active flexion of the fingers, and they reported improved performance of activities of daily living. When the wrist was in 30 degrees of extension, the average active grasp strength was twenty-one millimeters of mercury and the average key-pinch strength was 2.2 kilograms. The average active flexion of the fingers from the resting position, measured from the tip of the finger to the distal palmar crease, was 1.5 centimeters. Only one patient did not gain active flexion of the fingers. Of the entire group, this patient had the least function of the hand on preoperative evaluation; retrospectively, he seemed to be a poor candidate for operation, since the strength of the pronator teres muscle and the sensibility of the hand were insufficient for useful function. We concluded that, in selected tetraplegic patients, transfer of the pronator teres tendon to the flexor digitorum profundus tendons provides useful active flexion of the fingers.\r"

Fifteen of the procedures were done for a failed knee arthroplasty; eight had failed because of infection and seven, because of aseptic loosening. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three knees united three to four months after the first attempt at arthrodesis and three united after technical errors were corrected. One knee had a broken nail and a non-union; this was still untreated at the time of writing. Four nails broke: three in the line of fusion and one in the line of an infected supracondylar pseudarthrosis of the femur. No new infections developed after the arthrodesis. Three patients had had an infection and a chronic fistula before the arthrodesis, and the fistulae healed six, fourteen, and eighteen months postoperatively. In another patient, who had had infection and necrosis of the skin preoperatively, the wound healed in six months. All of these knees healed without an additional major operation. The functional result was satisfactory in all patients. After the arthrodesis, seventeen of the thirty-three patients needed less aid when walking, and no patient needed more aid. Fusion of the knee with a long intramedullary nail can be safe and effective, even in the presence of infection, if the revision is performed properly and certain technical principles are followed. It is especially important to establish good contact between the resected bones.\r"

Each observer was supplied with descriptions and illustrations of the classifications and each hip was grouped by both systems by each observer. The results were statistically analysed using 'kappa' statistics. The level of interobserver agreement was higher for the Salter-Thompson system and correlated with the level of experience of the observer. Both systems can give acceptable levels of interobserver agreement, but the Salter-Thompson grouping is simpler and easier to apply in the earlier stages of the disease when treatment must be decided, and has a higher degree of reproducibility amongst more experienced observers.\r"

Of these, 52 girls and 35 boys were reviewed after a mean follow-up of 13.8 years. The mean pre-operative slip was 76% and pain frequency correlated with the severity of the lumbosacral kyphosis but not with that of the slip. Posterior fusion was used in 54, posterolateral in 30 and anterior fusion in three patients. There were no major complications but 16 had re-operations for non-union or root symptoms. At follow-up there were three non-unions. After operation, 19 patients had 10% or more progression of the slip, but 10 showed correction by more than 10% as a result of remodelling. The lumbosacral kyphosis had increased by more than 10 degrees in 45%. Postoperative progression of the slip and of lumbosacral kyphosis was significantly more if the posterior element had been removed. At follow-up 77 patients were subjectively improved, four were unchanged, and one was worse. These results did not correlate with either the degree of the slip, or the angle of lumbosacral kyphosis. Fusion in situ is safe and gives good long-term clinical results. Secondary changes are associated with increased lumbosacral kyphosis, so reduction of this should be considered in severe cases.\r"

We have reviewed the effects of these changes on spinal mechanics, and their possible clinical significance. Cadaveric lumbar spines subjected to periods of creep loading show a disc height change similar to the physiological change. As a result intervertebral discs bulge more, become stiffer in compression and more flexible in bending. Disc tissue becomes more elastic as its water content falls, and its affinity for water increases. Disc prolapse becomes more difficult. The neural arch and associated ligaments resist an increasing proportion of the compressive and bending stresses acting on the spine. Observations on living people show that these changes are not fully compensated for by modified muscle activity. We conclude that different spinal structures are more heavily loaded at different times of the day. Therefore, the time of onset of symptoms and signs, and any diurnal variation in their severity, may help us understand more about the pathophysiology of low back pain and sciatica.\r"

In a prospective clinical study of 127 consecutive patients having lumbar discography, the injected contrast contained cephazolin 1 mg per ml. None of the patients developed clinical or radiographic signs of discitis.

The latter group of patients had had an average of 12 operations and 50 months of treatment, including eight months in hospital. We used a new limb injury score based on damage to the individual tissue elements; this indicated that, even in the absence of neurovascular injury, the presence of severe damage to skin, bone and muscle, with wound contamination, particularly in the lower tibia, had a poor prognosis. We therefore recommend, to avoid multiple operations, with prolonged hospitalisation and suffering, that these patients should have early independent review by orthopaedic and plastic surgeons with the aim of establishing an accurate prognosis for the salvage of a useful limb.\r"

In almost all cases radiography showed that the CHA was well-incorporated into the host bone, with new bone formation in and around the CHA. Corrective remodelling of deformed bone and normal fracture healing suggested that there was normal bone turnover in the presence of the CHA. Histology of biopsies from seven patients showed bone ingrowth into the pore structure of CHA in the central zone of some defects by one year after implantation.

On one side the proximal tibial periosteum was divided circumferentially and stripped for 1 cm. After six weeks, growth was measured at both proximal and distal growth plates. Compression inhibited total tibial growth and distraction enhanced it. The compressed growth plate grew less and the distracted growth plate grew more, but there was a reciprocal change at the other end of the bone. Periosteal division enhanced growth at the adjacent growth plate but inhibited it distally; the effect of distraction was enhanced and that of compression reduced. We found reciprocal growth rates at the proximal and distal growth plates. Relatively small amounts of compression or distraction did affect total bone growth. Periosteal division appeared to induce overgrowth at least partly by a mechanical effect; it may be useful as an adjunct to other methods of leg lengthening, though not to epiphyseolysis.\r"

Healing was faster and the union between the graft and adjacent bone developed torsional strength significantly more rapidly with vascularised than with non-vascularised grafts. These findings suggest that postoperative radiotherapy is unlikely to have a significantly deleterious effect on the healing of bone grafts used to repair defects produced by excision of malignant bone tumours.\r"

Ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, antagonizes blister fluid inhibition of fibrinolysis. The activity of ibuprofen appears to be unrelated to the synthesis of prostaglandins because other nonsteroidal drugs that were tested, such as indomethacin, imidazole, and tolmetin had significantly less antagonistic activity. This plasmin inhibition, which is contained in burn blister fluid, may contribute to vascular occlusion after burn injury, which leads to secondary dermal ischemia and necrosis in patients traumatized by burns.\r"

The grafts maintained 34% of their original area at 180 days, but the full-thickness burns retained only 4.5% of the initial area.

(2) Is there any advantage to early excision of the perineal burn wound? (3) What are the complications of perineal wounds? One hundred three patients with perineal burns were identified; mean burn size was 36% of total body surface area. There were 29 deaths in this group but none were related to the perineal burns. Of the 74 survivors 36 (49%) needed Foley catheters. However, the catheters were in place for the period of resuscitation only. There were no urethral complications associated with catheterization. Only three patients required surgery: one had a urethral meatotomy and two had split-thickness skin grafts. In conclusion, we found no genitourinary complications associated with perineal burns. Almost all perineal and genital burns were managed without indwelling catheters. Early excision of the perineal burn wound is not necessary, and most of these wounds will heal satisfactorily without grafting.\r"

In the present study, antiidiotypes in IVIg are shown to recognize a cross-reactive idiotype on human anti-thyroglobulin (TG) autoantibodies, that was defined by heterologous antiidiotypic antibodies, termed anti-T44 antibodies. The T44 idiotype is located outside the antibody-combining site of anti-TG autoantibodies. F(ab')2 fragments from anti-T44 antibodies inhibited the binding of IVIg to affinity-purified F(ab')2 anti-TG autoantibodies. Anti-T44 antibodies bound to F(ab')2 fragments of patients' antibodies, which were retained on an affinity column of Sepharose-bound F(ab')2 fragments from IVIg, but not to F(ab')2 fragments from the effluent of the column. The T44 idiotype was expressed on antibodies that bound to IVIg from eight of nine patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, but not on IVIg-binding Igs from healthy individuals. A small amount of the T44 idiotype was also expressed on the fraction of IVIg that bound to itself upon affinity chromatography. The T44 idiotype was cross-reactive between antibodies from patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Thus, IVIg contain antiidiotypic antibodies directed against an immunodominant disease-associated cross-reactive alpha-idiotype of human anti-TG autoantibodies. These results support the concept that IVIg may be beneficial in selected autoimmune diseases by modulating the function of the idiotypic network.\r"

PTH[1-34] induced a 12- to 15-fold increase in the efficiency of colony formation in soft agar by chondrocytes from embryonic 13- to 19-d-old chickens and fetal 25-d-old rabbits with a 10-fold increase in their DNA content. It also caused a 2.5-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in fetal 25-d-old rabbit chondrocytes. No mitogenic responses to PTH were observed, however, in postnatal 7- to 21-d-old chick chondrocytes or postnatal 21-d-old rabbit chondrocytes. This age dependency was observed only with PTH: fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and insulin stimulated chondrocyte proliferation irrespective of cartilage age. The absence of a mitogenic effect in postnatal chondrocytes was not due to a decrease in number or a reduction in affinity of receptors for PTH. PTH also increased [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans and the cyclic AMP level in fetal and postnatal chondrocytes, but at 100-fold higher concentrations (10(-8)-10(-7) M) than those (10(-10)-10(-9) M) required for the stimulation of cell division. These results suggest that PTH is a potent mitogen for embryonic chondrocytes, and that its mitogenic effect disappears selectively after birth.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which bone resorbing osteoclasts form and are activated by hormones are poorly understood. We show here that the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals in cultured bone is associated with the formation of new osteoclasts and enhanced bone resorption, identical to the effects seen when bones are treated with hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and interleukin 1 (IL-1). When free oxygen radicals were generated adjacent to bone surfaces in vivo, osteoclasts were also formed. PTH and IL-1-stimulated bone resorption was inhibited by both natural and recombinant superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that depletes tissues of superoxide anions. We used the marker nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) to identify the cells that were responsible for free radical production in resorbing bones. NBT staining was detected only in osteoclasts in cultures of resorbing bones. NBT staining in osteoclasts was decreased in bones coincubated with calcitonin, an inhibitor of bone resorption. We also found that isolated avian osteoclasts stained positively for NBT. NBT staining in isolated osteoclasts was increased when the cells were incubated with bone particles, to which they attach. We confirmed the formation of superoxide anion in isolated avian osteoclasts using ferricytochrome c reduction as a method of detection. The reduction of ferricytochrome c in isolated osteoclasts was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. Our results suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals, and particularly the superoxide anion, are intermediaries in the formation and activation of osteoclasts.\r"

Intravenous loxiglumide (22 mumol/kg per h) was highly potent in antagonizing CCK8-induced pancreatic enzyme and bile acid secretion as well as pancreatic polypeptide release. The potency and selectivity of loxiglumide as an antagonist of CCK provides the tool for evaluating the role of CCK as a physiological mediator of meal-induced pancreatic and biliary responses in humans. Infusion of a liquid test meal into the duodenum evoked an immediate response of pancreatic enzyme and bilirubin outputs, respectively. Intravenous loxiglumide significantly inhibited the meal-induced pancreatic amylase output by 63% (P less than 0.05), lipase output by 43% (P less than 0.05), and bilirubin output by 59% (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that CCK is a physiological mediator of the intestinal phase of meal-stimulated pancreatic and biliary responses.\r"

In normal, nontransplanted hearts HA was present in the adventitia of arteries and veins and in the myocardial interstitial tissue. An increased accumulation of HA was evident in the edematous interstitial tissue, infiltrated with lymphocytes, on day 4 after allogeneic transplantation, and was even more pronounced by day 6. No apparent increase in HA was seen in syngeneic grafts. Biochemical assay of HA in heart tissue demonstrated that the myocardial content of HA had increased 60% by day 2 after transplantation in allogeneic as well as syngeneic grafts, indicating that surgical trauma may induce some HA accumulation in heart grafts. The extractable amount of HA declined during the following days in the syngeneic grafts, but increased progressively during the development of rejection in the allogeneic grafts, and increased on average three times by day 6. The relative water content also increased progressively during rejection of allogeneic grafts and correlated with the HA accumulation. The interstitial accumulation of HA, a glycosaminoglycan with unique water-binding qualities, is presumably implicated in the development of interstitial edema during rejection of heart grafts.\r"

Diarrhea was not seen with a strain (strain A) that colonized the intestine but did not produce NAG-ST, nor with a strain (strain B) that produced NAG-ST but did not colonize. Persons receiving strain C had diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Diarrheal stool volumes ranged from 154 to 5,397 ml; stool samples from the patient having 5,397 ml of diarrhea were tested and found to contain NAG-ST. The median incubation period for illness was 10 h. There was a suggestion that occurrence of diarrhea was dependent on inoculum size. Immune responses to homologous outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, and whole-cell lysates were demonstrable with all three strains. Our data demonstrate that V. cholerae of O groups other than 1 are able to cause severe diarrheal disease. However, not all strains are pathogenic for humans: virulence of strain C may be dependent on its ability both to colonize the intestine and to produce a toxin such as NAG-ST.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms responsible for changes in myocardial contractility during regional ischemia are unknown. Since changes in high-energy phosphates during ischemia are sensitive to reductions in myocardial blood flow, it was hypothesized that myocardial function under steady-state conditions of graded regional ischemia is closely related to changes in myocardial high-energy phosphates. Therefore, phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was employed in an in vivo porcine model of graded coronary stenosis. Simultaneous measurements of regional subendocardial blood flow, high-energy phosphates, pH, and myocardial segment shortening were made during various degrees of regional ischemia in which subendocardial blood flow was reduced by 16-94%. During mild reductions in myocardial blood flow (subendocardial blood flow = 83% of nonischemic myocardium), only the ratio of phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate (PCr/Pi), Pi, and [H+] were significantly changed from control. PCr, ATP, and PCr/ATP were not significantly reduced from control with mild reductions in blood flow. Changes in myocardial segment shortening were most closely associated with changes in PCr/Pi (r = 0.94). Pi and [H+] were negatively correlated with segment shortening (r = -0.64 and -0.58, respectively) and increased over twofold when blood flow was reduced by 62%. Thus, these data demonstrate that PCr/Pi is sensitive to reductions in myocardial blood flow and closely correlates with changes in myocardial function. These data are also consistent with a role for Pi or H+ as inhibitors of myocardial contractility during ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "The superoxide-forming respiratory burst oxidase of human neutrophils is composed of membrane-associated catalytic components and cytosolic constituents required for oxidase activation. This study concerns the hypothesis that cytosolic oxidase components translocate to a membrane fraction when neutrophils are stimulated and the oxidase is activated. A polyclonal antiserum that recognizes two discrete cytosolic oxidase components of 47 and 67 kD was used to probe transfer blots of electrophoresed membrane and cytosol fractions of resting and stimulated neutrophils. In contrast to their strictly cytosolic localization in unstimulated cells, both proteins were detected in membrane fractions of neutrophils activated by phorbol esters and other stimuli. This translocation event was a function of stimulus concentration as well as time and temperature of exposure to the stimulus. It was inhibited by concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide that blocked superoxide formation but was unaffected by 2-deoxyglucose. There was a correlation between translocation of the cytosolic proteins and activation of the oxidase as determined by superoxide formation. Quantitative analyses suggested that approximately 10% of total cellular p47 and p67 became membrane-associated during phorbol ester activation of the oxidase. Analysis of Percoll density gradient fractions indicated that the target membrane for translocation of both proteins was the plasma membrane rather than membranes of either specific or azurophilic granules. In the cell-free oxidase system arachidonate-dependent but membrane-independent precipitation of the cytosolic oxidase proteins was demonstrated. The data show that activation of the respiratory burst oxidase in stimulated human neutrophils is closely associated with translocation of the 47- and 67-kD cytosolic oxidase components to the plasma membrane. We suggest that this translocation event is important in oxidase activation.\r"

The present studies examine the response to ASP of cultured skin fibroblasts from normal subjects patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and patients with hypertriglyceridemia without hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. Triglyceride synthesis induced by ASP did not differ significantly among the normals, the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and the patients with hypertriglyceridemia with normal low density lipoprotein (LDL) apolipoprotein B levels; however, on average, it was markedly reduced in the patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia. In all groups studied, evidence of specific saturable binding of radioiodinated ASP was present. Binding, however, was significantly reduced in the groups with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia whereas the other three groups were indistinguishable. By contrast, LDL-specific binding was reduced only in the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. There was a significant direct relation between the degree of ASP binding and the triglyceride synthesis inducible by ASP. In addition, with the exception of the patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, there was an inverse relation between both ASP-specific binding and ASP-induced triglyceride synthesis in fibroblasts to LDL levels in plasma whereas no relation was evident to plasma high density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein.\r"

  ".W": "The cells that make up blood vessel walls appear to participate actively in local immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in certain vascular diseases. We tested here whether smooth muscle cells (SMC) can produce the important inflammatory mediator IL6. Unstimulated SMC in vitro elaborated 5 X 10(3) pg recIL6/24h (i.e., biological activity equivalent to 5 X 10(3) pg recombinant IL6 (recIL6), as determined in B9-assay with a recIL6 standard). Several pathophysiologically relevant factors augmented IL6 release from SMC including 10 micrograms LPS/ml (10(4) pg recIL6), 10 ng tumor necrosis factor/ml (4 X 10(4) pg recIL6), and most notably 10 ng IL1/ml (greater than or equal to 3.2 X 10(5) pg recIL6). Production of IL6 activity corresponded to IL6 mRNA accumulation and de novo synthesis. SMC released newly synthesized IL6 rapidly, as little metabolically labeled material remained cell-associated. In supernatants of IL1-stimulated SMC, IL6 accounted for as much as 4% of the secreted proteins. In normal vessels SMC seldom divide, but SMC proliferation can occur in hypertension or during atherogenesis. We therefore tested the relationship between IL6 production and SMC proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in vitro. Quiescent SMC released scant IL6 activity, whereas PDGF (1-100 ng/ml) produced concentration-dependent and coordinate enhancement of SMC proliferation and IL6 release (linear regression of growth vs. IL6 release yielded r greater than 0.9). IL6 itself neither stimulated nor inhibited SMC growth or IL6 production. Intact medial strips studied in short-term organoid culture produced large quantities of IL6, similar to the results obtained with cultured SMC. These findings illustrate a new function of vascular SMC by which these cells might participate in local immunoregulation and in the pathogenesis of various important vascular diseases as well as in inflammatory responses generally.\r"

The activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO), which generates O2-, were elevated in the s-BALF, lung tissue homogenate, and serum (plasma). The elevations were most remarkable in s-BALF and in lung tissue: We found a 170-fold increase in ADA activity and a 400-fold increase in XO activity as measured per volume of alveolar lavage fluid. The ratio of activity of XO to activity of xanthine dehydrogenase in s-BALF increased from 0.15 +/- 0.05 (control; no infection) to 1.06 +/- 0.13 on day 6 after viral infection. Increased levels of various adenosine catabolites (i.e., inosine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid) in serum and s-BALF were confirmed. We also identified O2- generation from XO in s-BALF obtained on days 6 and 8 after infection, and the generation of O2- was enhanced remarkably in the presence of adenosine. Lastly, treatment with allopurinol (an inhibitor of XO) and with chemically modified superoxide dismutase (a scavenger of O2-) improved the survival rate of influenza virus-infected mice. These results indicate that generation of oxygen-free radicals by XO, coupled with catabolic supply of hypoxanthine from adenosine catabolism, is a pathogenic principle in influenza virus infection in mice and that a therapeutic approach by elimination of oxygen radicals thus seems possible.\r"

Hence, enhancement of T cell reactivity to viral and bacterial antigens is important in the treatment of patients with AIDS. To develop tools for amplifying T cell reactivity, we have immunized mice with human helper T cell clones and selected monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that enhance in vitro blastogenic responses. MAb NDA5, which recognizes the leukocyte common antigen CD45, amplifies human T cell responses to mitogens and soluble antigens including HIV-1 glycoprotein (gp)-120 and peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp-120 sequence. In the presence of MAb NDA5, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy, HIV-1-seronegative individual displayed augmented blastogenic responses to HIV-1 gp-120 and to HIV-1 gp-120 synthetic peptides. In vitro memory responses to various vaccines and to alloantigens were also enhanced in cultures with MAb. Similarly, the response of PBMC from AIDS patients to pokeweed mitogen, HIV-1 gp-120, and tetanus toxoid was enhanced with MAb NDA5. The finding that the in vitro immune response of patients with AIDS can be amplified with MAb NDA5, suggests that the in vivo immune response of immunodeficient individuals can also be enhanced.\r"

To examine these potential mechanisms, metabolic parameters measured by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and spontaneous diastolic myofilament motion caused by sarcoplasmic reticulum-myofilament calcium cycling indexed by the scattered light intensity fluctuations (SLIF) it produces in laser beam reflected from the heart, were studied in isolated atrioventricularly blocked rat hearts (n = 10) after 65 min of ischemia at 30 degrees C. All metabolic parameters recovered to their full extent 5 min after reperfusion. Developed pressure evidenced a small recovery but then fell abruptly. This was accompanied by an increase in end diastolic pressure to 37 +/- 5 mm Hg and a fourfold increase in SLIF, to 252 +/- 58% of baseline. In another series of hearts initial reperfusion with calcium of 0.08 mM prevented the SLIF rise and resulted in improved developed pressure (74 +/- 3% vs. 39 +/- 13% of control), and lower cell calcium (5.9 +/- 3 vs. 10.3 +/- 1.4 mumol/g dry wt). Thus, during reperfusion, delayed contractile recovery is not associated with delayed recovery of pH, inorganic phosphate, or high-energy phosphates and can be attributed, in part, to an adverse effect of calcium loading which can be indexed by increased SLIF occurring at that time.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophils from peripheral blood may physically interact with platelets in several settings including hemostasis, inflammation, and a variety of vascular disorders. A role for lipoxygenase (LO)-derived products has been implicated in each of these events; therefore, we investigated the formation of lipoxins during coincubation of human neutrophils and platelets. Simultaneous addition of FMLP and thrombin to coincubations of these cells led to formation of both lipoxin A4 and lipoxin B4, which were monitored by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Neither stimulus nor cell type alone induced the formation of these products. When leukotriene A4 (LTA4), a candidate for the transmitting signal, was added to platelets, lipoxins were formed. In cell-free 100,000 g supernatants of platelet lysates, which displayed 12-LO activity, LTA4 was also transformed to lipoxins. Platelet formation of lipoxins was inhibited by the LO inhibitor esculetin and partially sensitive to chelation of Ca2+, while neither acetylsalicylic acid nor indomethacin significantly inhibited their generation. In contrast, neutrophils did not transform LTA4 to lipoxins. Cell-free 100,000 g supernatants of neutrophil lysates converted LTA4 to LTB4. These results indicate that neutrophil-platelet interactions can lead to the formation of lipoxins from endogenous sources and provide a role for platelet 12-LO in the formation of lipoxins from LTA4.\r"

There are many examples of clonal heterogeneity in apparently homogeneous connective tissue cell populations, and it has been suggested that selection of cell populations with particular phenotypic features is the basis for the development of pathologic connective tissue changes in inflammatory disorders. In these studies we report characterization of the pattern of matrix biosynthesis and responses to hormones in cells cloned from normal human dermis. The results indicate that cloned dermal fibroblasts are heterogeneous with respect to synthesis of collagens as well as their responses to prostaglandin E2 and parathyroid hormone. Selective expansion of clonal populations with unique patterns of matrix synthesis and cell surface receptors could provide the basis for abnormal connective tissue remodeling in certain pathologic states.\r"

The antibodies were monospecific, recognizing polypeptides of 91 and 22 kD, respectively, on Western blots of whole neutrophil extracts. The antibodies were used in Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions of purified neutrophils to confirm that the distribution of cytochrome b spectral absorbance matched that of the two subunits. Thin sections of cryofixed, molecular distillation-dried granulocytes were labeled with the anti-cytochrome b antibodies, followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody, and final labeling with streptavidin-conjugated colloidal gold. Electron microscopy revealed that the cytochrome b light and heavy chains were localized primarily (80%) to 0.1-0.2-micron round or elliptical granule-like structures in neutrophils and 0.4-0.5-micron granules in eosinophils. Approximately 20% of the cytochrome b was localized to the surface, confirming the subcellular fractionation studies. Double staining experiments on the neutrophils, using polyclonal rabbit anti-lactoferrin antibody, indicated that the cytochrome-bearing structures also contained lactoferrin and thus were specific granules. When the analysis was performed on neutrophils that had phagocytosed Staphylococcus aureus, cytochrome b was found in the phagosomal membrane adjoining the bacterial cell wall.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmia suppression by propranolol, we determined the antiarrhythmic efficacy of d-propranolol in 10 patients with frequent ventricular ectopic depolarizations (VEDs) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. After an initial placebo phase, 40 mg d-propranolol was administered orally every 6 h with dosage increased every 2 d until arrhythmia suppression (greater than or equal to 80% VED reduction), intolerable side effects, or a maximal dosage (1,280 mg/d) was reached. Response was verified by documenting return of arrhythmia during a final placebo phase. Arrhythmia suppression occurred in six patients while two more had partial responses. Effective dosages were 320-1,280 mg/d (mean 920 +/- 360, SD) of d-propranolol with corresponding plasma concentrations of 60-2,280 ng/ml (mean 858 +/- 681). For the entire group, the QTc interval shortened by 4 +/- 4% (P = 0.03). Arrhythmia suppression was accompanied by a reduction in peak heart rate during exercise of 0-29%. To determine whether arrhythmia suppression could be attributed to beta-blockade, racemic propranolol was then administered in dosages producing the same or greater depression of exercise heart rate. In 3/8 patients, arrhythmias were not suppressed by racemic propranolol indicating that d-propranolol was effective via a non-beta-mediated action. By contrast, in 5/8 patients racemic propranolol also suppressed VEDs. We conclude that propranolol suppresses ventricular arrhythmias by both beta- and non-beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects.\r"

  ".W": "The time course of the relative myocardial phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate contents (PCr/ATP) during step changes in heart rate in vivo was studied in 14 dogs using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine if transient changes in the high energy phosphates occur with changes in cardiac work. Coronary sinus blood flow (CF), oxygen consumption (MVO2), and NMR data were simultaneously measured during brief (approximately 3 min), paced increases in heart rate in these open chest animals. 31P spectra were collected with a time resolution of 15-16 s (PCr signal to noise 22-41:1). Paced tachycardia associated with increased CF and MVO2 had no significant transient or sustained effect on PCr/ATP. Higher heart rates, associated with decreased CF and blood pressure, caused rapid decreases of PCr/ATP that were reversible upon return to control rates. These data indicate that there are no transient changes in 31P metabolites (on a 15-16-s time base) during step changes in cardiac work associated with increased CF. This lack of change demonstrates that ATP hydrolysis and production are closely matched and that the feedback mechanism linking these processes occurs rapidly with no detectable transient change in the phosphate metabolites. In contrast, when the CF response to tachycardia is insufficient PCr is quickly depleted. This latter result suggests that the PCr/ATP ratio may be a sensitive, rapidly responding indicator of coronary supply/demand mismatching in vivo.\r"

We have optimized conditions for measurement of immunoreactive Met-enkephalin in plasma and for generation by trypsin and carboxypeptidase B of much greater amounts of total peptidase-derivable Met-enkephalin in plasma of rats, dogs, and humans. Free Met-enkephalin (11 pM) is constituted by native pentapeptide and its sulfoxide. Characterization of plasma total Met-enkephalin derived by peptidic hydrolysis revealed a small amount (38 pM) of Met-enkephalin associated with peptides of molecular mass less than 30,000 D, and probably derived from proenkephalin A, but much larger amounts of Met-enkephalin associated with albumin (1.2 nM) and with a globulin-sized protein (2.8 nM). Thus, plasma protein precursors for peptidase-derivable Met-enkephalin differ structurally and chemically from proenkephalin A. Met-enkephalin generated from plasma by peptidic hydrolysis showed naloxone-reversible bioactivity comparable to synthetic Met-enkephalin. Prolonged exposure of adult, male rats to restraint stress produced biphasic plasma responses, with peaks occurring at 30 s and 30 min in both free native and total peptidase-derivable Met-enkephalin. Repeated daily exposure to this 30-min stress resulted in adaptive loss of responses of both forms to acute restraint. Initial plasma responses of Met-enkephalin paralleled those of epinephrine and norepinephrine, but subsequently showed divergence of response. In conclusion, Met-enkephalin circulates in several forms, some of which may be derived from proteins other than proenkephalin A, and plasma levels of both free native, and peptidase-derivable Met-enkephalin are modulated physiologically.\r"

We quantitated the amount and activation state (phosphorylation-dephosphorylation) of the rate-limiting enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, in epidermis before and after barrier disruption. In murine epidermis we found high enzyme activity (1.75 +/- 0.02 nmol/min per mg protein). After acute barrier disruption, enzyme activity began to increase after 1.5 h, reaching a maximum increase by 2.5 h, and returned to normal by 15 h. Chronic barrier disruption increased total enzyme activity by 83%. In normal epidermis, measurement of HMG CoA reductase activity in microsomes isolated in NaF- vs. NaCl-containing buffers demonstrated that 46 +/- 2% of the enzyme was in the active form. After acute or chronic barrier disruption, a marked increase in the percentage of HMG CoA reductase in the active form was observed. Acute disruption increased enzyme activation state as early as 15 min, reaching a maximum after 2.5 h, with an increase still present at 15 h, indicating that changes in activation state had a close temporal relationship with barrier function. Increases in total HMG CoA reductase activity occurred only after profound barrier disruption, whereas changes in activation state occur with lesser degrees of barrier disruption. Artificial correction of barrier function prevented the increase in total HMG CoA reductase activity, and partially prevented the increase in enzyme activation. These results show that barrier requirements regulate epidermal cholesterol synthesis by modulating both the HMG CoA reductase amount and activation state.\r"

In the second experiment, 20 RE/kg body wt was given with a fat-rich meal (1 g fat/kg body wt) to seven younger subjects (aged less than 50 yr) and seven older subjects (aged greater than or equal to 50 yr). In both experiments, postprandial plasma retinyl ester response increased significantly with advancing age (P less than 0.05). In the third experiment, retinyl ester-rich plasma was infused intravenously into nine young adult subjects (aged 18-30 yr) and nine elderly subjects (aged greater than or equal to 60 yr), and the rate of retinyl ester disappearance from plasma during the subsequent 3 h was determined. Mean (+/- SE) plasma retinyl ester residence time was 31 +/- 4 min in the young adult subjects vs. 57 +/- 8 min in the elderly subjects (P less than 0.05). These data are consistent with the concept that increased postprandial plasma retinyl ester concentrations in older subjects are due to delayed plasma clearance of retinyl esters in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins of intestinal origin.\r"

  ".W": "The adrenergic regulation of lipolysis was investigated in situ at rest and during standardized bicycle exercise in nonobese healthy subjects, using microdialysis of the extracellular space in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The glycerol concentration was about two times greater in adipose tissue than in venous blood. At rest, the glycerol concentration in adipose tissue was rapidly increased by 100% (P less than 0.01) after the addition of phentolamine to the ingoing perfusate, whereas addition of propranolol did not alter the adipose tissue glycerol level. Glycerol in adipose tissue and plasma increased during exercise and decreased in the postexercise period. Propranolol in the perfusate almost completely inhibited the increase in the tissue dialysate glycerol during the exercise-postexercise period. Phentolamine, however, was completely ineffective in this respect. During exercise, the lipolytic activity was significantly more marked in abdominal than in gluteal adipose tissue; this was much more apparent in women than in men. Thus, in vivo lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue is regulated by different adrenergic mechanisms at rest and during exercise. Alpha-adrenergic inhibitory effects modulate lipolysis at rest, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulatory effects modulate lipolysis during exercise. In addition, regional differences in lipolysis are present in vivo during exercise, which seem governed by factors relating to sex.\r"

Total IgM, as well as IgM anti-DNA and RF, were assessed by ELISA. Total IgM production was induced from adult and neonatal B cells with SA plus T cell factors, as well as anti-CD3-stimulated T cells. RF was induced from adult and cord blood B cells by either mode of stimulation, whereas significant anti-DNA production was observed only when B cells were stimulated with anti-CD3-activated T cells.

Azurocidin and p29b share NH2-terminal sequence homology with each other as well as with elastase, cathepsin G, and other serine proteases. p29b bound [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate and hydrolyzed elastin, casein, and hemoglobin. A peptide substrate for p29b could not be identified. Azurocidin neither bound [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate nor hydrolyzed any of the proteins, peptides, or esters tested. In microbicidal assays, purified azurocidin was comparable to p29b in activity against Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial activity of azurocidin was enhanced under mildly acidic conditions, but was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by NaCl, CaCl2, or serum. Immunoblot analysis with monospecific antibodies localized greater than 90% of the azurocidin and greater than 75% of the p29b to azurophil granule-rich fractions of PMN lysates. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the localization of azurocidin to the azurophil granules. Azurocidin associated with the azurophil granule membrane, but did not appear to be an integral membrane protein. Thus, azurocidin and p29b are members of a family of serine protease homologs stored in azurophil granules and may play a role in inflammatory and antimicrobial processes involving PMN.\r"

Instead, PDGF-AA inhibited the chemotactic activity of PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on fibroblasts and monocytes. However, PDGF-AA was not able to block monocyte chemotaxis induced by FMLP. In contrast, in granulocytes, dose-dependent chemotactic responses were obtained with all three isoforms of PDGF. All isoforms gave maximal responses at concentrations between 5 and 20 ng/ml. At higher concentrations the migration was reduced. Reduction and alkylation of the PDGF molecule, which leads to loss of the mitogenic activity, also caused a loss of the chemotactic activities for all three cell types. The data suggest that the various isoforms of PDGF stimulate and inhibit chemotaxis in an isoform- and cell type-specific manner.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in vitro have shown that L-histidine increases the hydroosmotic response to vasopressin. We examined whether this phenomenon occurs also in vivo. Homozygous Brattleboro rats (di/di) were fed a regular diet (0.5% histidine) or a diet enriched with histidine and received 1 ng of 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) daily. Addition of histidine (1% by weight) increased post-dDAVP urine osmolality to a level higher than that of control (502 +/- 62 vs. 316 +/- 36 mosmol/kg, P less than 0.05). Similar results were seen with 3.0% and 5.5% dietary histidine. There were significant increases in free-water reabsorption and in the ratio of free-water reabsorption to osmolar clearance, but no difference in osmolal clearance. No significant effect was found with supplemental histidine of 0.5% or less. The cause for these findings appears not to be the metabolism of histidine, since the nonmetabolizable D-histidine had a significant, albeit smaller, effect, and the isonitrogenous addition of albumin, alanine, arginine, or glutamine was ineffective. In part, histidine may operate by increasing cAMP since the renal cAMP content in response to vasopressin is increased in histidine-fed rats (13.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.8 nmol/g dry weight, P less than 0.01). The role of prostaglandins appears less clear. Histidine greatly decreased urinary PGE2 during baseline (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.0 +/- 2.3 micrograms/mg creatinine, P less than 0.001), but it profoundly augmented urinary prostaglandin excretion after dDAVP stimulation (40.0 +/- 4.2 vs. 7.0 +/- 2.0 micrograms/mg creatinine, P less than 0.001).\r"

Rings of aortae incubated in elevated glucose, contracted submaximally by phenylephrine, showed significantly decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by acetylcholine compared with the aortae incubated in control glucose. Treatment with indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, or SQ29548, a prostaglandin H2/thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, restored acetylcholine relaxations of rings in elevated glucose to normal, while these agents had no effect on the relaxation of rings incubated in control glucose. Aortae incubated with mannose (44 mM) as a hyperosmotic control relaxed to acetylcholine normally. The relaxations in response to A23187 and sodium nitroprusside were not different between rings exposed to control and elevated glucose. Radioimmunoassay measurements showed a significant increase in acetylcholine-stimulated release of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha in aortae with, but not without endothelium incubated with elevated, but not with control glucose. Thus a possible mechanism for endothelium dysfunction in diabetes mellitus is the hyperglycemia-induced increased generation of endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids.\r"

  ".W": "Apolipoprotein B-100 has a crucial structural role in the formation of VLDL and LDL. Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, a syndrome in which the concentration of LDL cholesterol in plasma is abnormally low, can be caused by mutations in the apo B gene that prevent the translation of a full-length apo B-100 molecule. Prior studies have revealed that truncated species of apo B [e.g., apo B-37 (1728 amino acids), apo B-46 (2057 amino acids)] can occasionally be identified in the plasma of subjects with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia; in each of these cases, the truncated apo B species has been a prominent protein component of VLDL. In this report, we describe a kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia in which the plasma of four affected heterozygotes contained a unique truncated apo B species, apo B-31. Apolipoprotein B-31 is caused by the deletion of a single nucleotide in the apo B gene, and it is predicted to contain 1425 amino acids. Apolipoprotein B-31 is the shortest of the mutant apo B species to be identified in the plasma of a subject with hypobetalipoproteinemia. In contrast to longer truncated apo B species, apo B-31 was undetectable in the VLDL and the LDL; however, it was present in the HDL fraction and the lipoprotein-deficient fraction of plasma. The density distribution of apo B-31 in the plasma suggests the possibility that the amino-terminal 1425 amino acids of apo B-100 are sufficient to permit the formation and secretion of small, dense lipoproteins but are inadequate to support the formation of the more lipid-rich VLDL and LDL particles.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we examined mRNA and protein levels for the muscle/adipose tissue glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in various tissues of spontaneously obese mice (C57BL/KsJ, db/db) and their lean littermates (db/+). Obese (db/db) mice were studied at 5 wk of age, when they were rapidly gaining weight and were severely insulin resistant, evidenced by hyperglycemia (plasma glucose 683 +/- 60 vs. 169 +/- 4 mg/dl in db/+, P less than 0.05) and hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin 14.9 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.52 +/- 0.08 ng/ml in db/+, P less than 0.05). The GLUT-4 mRNA was reduced in quadriceps muscle (67.5 +/- 8.5%, P = 0.02), but unaltered in adipose tissue (120 +/- 19%, NS), heart (95.7 +/- 6.1%, NS), or diaphragm (75.2 +/- 12.1%, NS) in obese (db/db) mice relative to levels in lean littermates. The GLUT-4 protein, measured by quantitative immunoblot analysis using two different GLUT-4 specific antibodies, was not different in five insulin-sensitive tissues including diaphragm, heart, red and white quadriceps muscle, and adipose tissue of obese (db/db) mice compared with tissue levels in lean littermates; these findings were consistent when measured relative to tissue DNA levels as an index of cell number. These data suggest that the marked defect in glucose utilization previously described in skeletal muscle of these young obese mice is not due to a decrease in the level of the major muscle glucose transporter. An alternate step in insulin-dependent activation of the glucose transport process is probably involved.\r"

  ".W": "The biochemical basis underlying the genetic polymorphism of drug N-acetylation was investigated using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays for arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and content in human liver. The acetylator phenotype of 26 surgical patients was determined using caffeine as an innocuous probe drug by measurement of the 5-acetyl-amino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil to 1-methylxanthine molar ratio in urine. Liver wedge biopsies from these patients and livers from 24 organ donors were then used for measurement of N-acetyltransferase activity with the substrate sulfamethazine and for quantitation of immunoreactive N-acetyl-transferase protein. In vivo (caffeine metabolites in urine) and in vitro (sulfamethazine acetylation) measures of N-acetyl-transferase activity correlated very highly (r = 0.98). Moreover, in all subjects tested, slow acetylation both in vivo and in vitro was associated with a decrease in the quantity of immunodetectable N-acetyltransferase protein in liver cytosol relative to that seen in cytosols from rapid acetylator livers. Two kinetically distinct enzyme activities, designated NAT-1 and NAT-2, were partially purified from low- and high-activity livers and their relationship to acetylator status was determined. Low acetylation capacity was related to decreases in the liver content of both of these immunologically related proteins. The results demonstrate that genetically defective arylamine N-acetylation is due to a parallel decrease in the quantity of two structurally and functionally similar acetylating enzymes.\r"

  ".W": "The leukocyte adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, and CD11c/CD18 (Leu-CAM) are members of the integrin receptor family and mediate crucial adhesion-dependent functions in leukocytes. The molecular basis for their deficient cell surface expression was sought in a patient suffering from severe and recurrent bacterial infections. Previous studies revealed that impaired cell surface expression of Leu-CAM is secondary to heterogeneous structural defects in the common beta subunit (CD18). Cloning and sequencing of complementary DNA encoding for CD18 in this patient revealed two mutant alleles, each representing a point mutation in the coding region of CD18 and resulting in an amino acid substitution. Each mutant allele results in impaired CD18 expression on the cell surface membrane of transfected COS M6 cells. One substitution involves an arginine residue (Arg593----cysteine) that is conserved in the highly homologous fourth cysteine-rich repeats of other mammalian integrin subfamilies. The other substitution involves a lysine residue (Lys196----threonine) located within another highly conserved region in integrins. These data identify crucial residues and regions necessary for normal cell surface expression of CD18 and possibly other integrin beta subunits and define a molecular basis for impaired cell surface expression of CD18 in this patient.\r"

The cellular foci were shown to be composed of paraganglionic cells. The cell clusters were well defined and predominantly comprised clear cells with scanty, fine eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules in three cases. The cell nuclei were round to oval, moderately pleomorphic, with evenly dispersed dense chromatin. It is concluded that the presence of minute foci of paraganglial cells in the bladder wall and prostate gland may be misinterpreted as malignant because of their close association with nerves and their relative rarity. Immunohistochemical staining with neuroendocrine markers should dispel any doubt about their identity.\r"

In many cases, particularly from fibroadenomas, the parenchyma consisted of single layers of polarised epithelial cells showing lumen formation. Similar arrays of apocrine epithelial cells were observed in 60% of fibrocystic lesions. The more solid clumps from hyperplastic lesions consisted of epithelial cells of variable shape and electron density with disorganised lumen formation. Irrespective of the type of lesion, the epithelial cells were not normally subtended by myoepithelial cells or basal lamina. The extraction process seems to result in a shearing between the epithelium and basal lamina with lysis of the myoepithelial cells. Most naked nuclei probably result from lysed myoepithelial cells.\r"

No correlation was found in either group between circulating and tissue eosinophils and no ethnic difference was identified in the lamina propria differential cell densities. The leucocyte count and serum orosomucoid concentrations, however, were significantly higher in the Caucasians. In the Asian group a strong negative association was found between the lamina propria eosinophil density and serum orosomucoids; in the Caucasian group there was a positive association between all blood variables. It is concluded that different mechanisms occur in the two ethnic groups and in Asians these might not be reflected by the more orthodox indices of colonic inflammation.\r"

On the basis of the indication for biopsy, patients were classified into three groups: those with haematuria (group I, n = 41); those with a minor degree of proteinuria (group II, n = 16); and those without any urinary abnormality but in whom possible renal disease as a result of systemic disease was suspected (group III, n = 6). About half of the patients with haematuria had significantly thinner glomerular basement membranes than those in the other two groups, irrespective of the variable selected for assessment, and in three this was confirmed in follow up biopsy specimens. Follow up for up to eight years showed that in patients either with or without thin basement membranes haematuria commonly persisted, but the long term outlook in all three groups was otherwise good and no patient developed impaired renal function.\r"

Lymphoid aggregates and plasma cell activity were found in the glomus pulmonale just as they were in the carotid bodies. Chronic pulmonary glomitis sometimes occurred in association with chronic carotid glomitis and sometimes independently of this. The mean age of the affected subjects was 76 years in isolated pulmonary glomitis and 79 years in chronic carotid glomitis. Chronic carotid glomitis affected seven (14%) subjects and predominated in women (six to one). In the seven cases of isolated pulmonary glomitis women predominated five to two. Chronic glomitis seems to be a disease process which may affect at least two members of the non-chromaffin paraganglionic system, but it is not clear why focal chronic inflammation affects the glomus pulmonale of one person but not of another.\r"

All patients and controls were cigarette smokers. Patients with smoke inhalation (SI) injury generally showed higher total bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell yields, and this was significant on repeat lavage from 12 patients. The increase was almost entirely due to an increase in the proportion of neutrophils in patients with smoke inhalation alone (S) and those with cutaneous burns as well as smoke inhalation (S + B). On sequential lavage of 12 patients with smoke inhalation (SI) the proportion of neutrophils had increased; this was significantly higher than on initial lavage. Using various macrophage markers, the proportions of macrophage subgroups were determined. There was an increase in UCHM1 and RFD9 positive cells in each subgroup: the increase in UCHM1 positive cells was significant in patients with burns as well as smoke inhalation, and the increase in RFD9 positive cells was significant in patients with smoke inhalation alone. Assessment of the role of such cells in the development of acute lung injury (such as adult respiratory distress syndrome) may be important in our understanding of the mechanisms entailed.\r"

The two fixatives used were Carson's buffered formalin and methacarn, and a DNAse pretreatment of sections was used. Overall agreement for the immunohistochemical methods with the ligand binding technique were 95%, 85%, and 86% for the frozen, formalin, and methacarn methods, respectively. A semiquantitative staining score was performed and all three methods gave significant correlations of staining scores with biochemical ligand binding values. The frozen section method was best (r = 0.88) with the fixed tissue methods yielding poorer correlation coefficients. Several factors affected staining, including the nature of the fixative and variable activity of DNAse. It is concluded that immunohistochemical assessment of oestrogen receptor content on fixed tissue provides acceptable qualitative information but that standardisation of protocols for tissue processing will be necessary for optimal utility and especially for quantitative assessments.\r"

Sixteen patients who were HIV antibody positive had other index diseases for the diagnosis of AIDS in the biopsy material and, when these were excluded, comparison with the control group still showed a significant difference; p less than 0.01, odds ratio 3.6, 95%, confidence interval 1.4-9.6. In this series, therefore, C pylori were far less common in HIV antibody positive patients than in controls. Among the HIV positive patients, a higher proportion of C pylori negative cases had AIDS but this trend was not significant. The findings of this study indicate that whatever abnormalities of cell mediated mucosal immunoregulation are caused by HIV infection, they do not seem to be important in the response to infection by C pylori.\r"

Four of the patients were followed up for more than three months. The Rose Bengal test and the microagglutination test were positive in cerebrospinal fluid in five of the six cases at some stage. The Coombs' test was positive in cerebrospinal fluid in every patient and in one was the only positive serological test. Cerebrospinal fluid positivity is not excluded by low titres or negative results of antibodies in the serum for any of the three methods. A Coombs' test or some equivalent must always be made on the cerebrospinal fluid to diagnose neurobrucellosis.\r"

To measure its concentrations in the tissue, levels of total and non-protein-bound itraconazole were determined in serum, suction-induced blister fluid, and cantharides-induced blister fluid. Six healthy subjects received 200 mg as a single dose, followed by 100 mg/day for 10 days. Itraconazole binding in suction-induced blister fluid (99.54%) and cantharides-induced blister fluid (99.77%) was calculated from plasma protein binding (99.8%). The single-dose study showed the drug levels in blister fluid to increase more slowly than those in serum. The terminal half-life of itraconazole in serum was 22.5 +/- 3.2 hours. Suction- and cantharides-induced blister fluid levels declined in parallel. After the final dose, itraconazole penetration into cantharides-induced blister fluid was only 70%. Moreover, trough levels of unbound itraconazole in suction- and cantharides-induced blister fluid were 0.239 +/- 0.115 and 0.334 +/- 0.101 ng/ml and thus were significantly lower than free itraconazole levels in serum (0.422 +/- 0.125 ng/ml). Thus a distribution equilibrium between serum and blister fluids was not obtained. Free drug concentrations in suction- and cantharides-induced blister fluid were far lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration values for Candida ssp. and dermatophytes.\r"

The percentage of CD8+ cells were lower at 1200 and 1800 hours in both active and static vitiligo patients than in control subjects. Cosinor analysis of the CD4+ cells showed a circadian rhythm in static vitiligo, whereas the rhythmicity was lost in active vitiligo. CD8+ cells did not show any circadian rhythm in either active or static vitiligo. Our data show more striking aberrations for T cell subtypes in active vitiligo than in static vitiligo. They suggest that cell-mediated immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.\r"

Therefore we treated six patients with alopecia areata (five men, one woman) with oral cyclosporine, 6 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. Three patients had alopecia universalis, one had alopecia totalis, and two had patchy alopecia areata of the scalp. Hair regrowth in the scalp of all patients occurred within the second and fourth weeks of therapy, followed by hair regrowth of the face and chest (in the male patients), pubic area, extremities, and axillae. Overall, the site of best response was the scalp. Cosmetically acceptable terminal hair regrowth on the scalp occurred in three of six patients. Significant hair loss, however, occurred in all patients within 3 months of discontinuation of cyclosporine treatment. Clinical response correlated with changes in immune cell infiltration of the hair follicles. The number of leukocytes per hair follicle was quantified in transverse scalp biopsy sections stained with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The degree of terminal hair regrowth correlated significantly with decreases in follicular epithelial human lymphocyte antigen-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression, T cells, helper/inducer (CD4) T cells, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8) T cells and Langerhans cells (CD1+DR+) from the hair follicles during cyclosporine therapy. A significant decrease in the CD4/CD8 ratio occurred early in the course of treatment and was maintained throughout the therapy. This decrease suggests that cyclosporine not only cleared immune cells from the hair follicles but also altered the balance of regulatory lymphocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The signs and symptoms associated with melanoma in children are similar to those in adults, as are the histopathologic features, biologic behavior, and treatment of this tumor. The inadequacy of available therapy for metastatic melanoma underscores the necessity for the early diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment of melanomas in children.\r"

All nevi met each of the following criteria: 5 mm or less in diameter, symmetric, round or slightly oval, uniform pigmentation, distinct and regular margins, and no erythema. One or more of the histologic features associated with dysplastic nevi were present in 87.8% of the lesions; two or more were present in 69%; and all three histologic features were found in 29.3%.

In a one-stage procedure the stretched skin is then immediately used to close the surgical defect. Three case reports demonstrating the immediate intraoperative tissue expansion technique, in which the Foley catheter balloon was used as the tissue expander, are presented. These cases illustrate that this technique may allow the surgeon to cover defects more easily with less tension and with a better cosmetic result than with other closure techniques.\r"

Annual incidence rates per 100,000 persons in the Rochester population, standardized to the 1980 U.S. white population, were 175 for men, 124 for women, and 146 combined. Recurrent or subsequent basal cell carcinoma was observed among 30% of patients during an average of 4.5 years of follow-up; no metastatic lesions occurred.

Nine patients with various cutaneous warts and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy persons were control subjects. Natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity against both K-562 erythroleukemic and Sk-v cells was in the normal range in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis induced by epidermodysplasia verruciformis-specific human papillomaviruses and in patients with cutaneous warts. The lysis of both targets, however, was significantly decreased in patients with the form of epidermodysplasia verruciformis associated with human papillomavirus type 3. Experiments with normal keratinocytes and with keratinocytes isolated from a malignant lesion bearing human papillomavirus type 5 genomes showed that the latter were susceptible to lysis by the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy persons and of patients with cutaneous warts. Lysis of keratinocytes in epidermodysplasia verruciformis, however, was strongly reduced in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis induced by specific human papillomaviruses. This reduction was not associated with a decrease in anti-K-562 natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis induced by disease-specific human papillomaviruses, there is reduced natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity against epidermodysplasia verruciformis keratinocytes.\r"

The sites of involvement were the mons pubis (one patient), perineal body (one), labium majus (three), labium minus (three), and vagina (seven). Ten patients (66.6%) died of their disease, one is alive with disease, and four are alive without evidence of disease. For the living patients the duration of follow-up was 20 to 118 months (mean 63.6 months). Of those who died, survival ranged from 3 to 76 months (mean 25.1 months). The predominant type of malignancy was superficial spreading melanoma 50%. Nodular melanoma represented 22%, and the nodular polypoidal variant 14%. Melanoma of the squamous mucosa, also referred to as lentiginous melanoma, constituted 14%. By using Chung's method of determining levels of invasion, we found that no lesion was in situ (level I), two were level II (less than 1.0 mm thick), one was level III (between 1.0 and 2.0 mm) and the remaining 11 patients had lesions that were greater than 2.0 mm (levels IV and V). Because the subcutaneous fat is not consistently present in all sites of the female genitalia, all tumors thicker than 2.0 mm were included in level IV, and no level V tumors were classified in our study. Using Breslow's microstaging method, we found the thickness to range from 0.65 to 9.5 mm (mean 4.75 mm). When we correlated survival with level and thickness of tumor in nine patients who died, one tumor was level III and eight were level IV; thickness ranged from 1.65 to 9.0 mm (mean 5.64 mm).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90187291\r", 
  ".W": "Dermatitis herpetiformis is a rare blistering skin disease characterized in part by granular IgA deposits at the dermoepidermal junction, an associated gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and a strong association with the human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A1 (74% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis), -B8 (88%), -DR3 (95%), and -DQw2 (100%). Dermatitis herpetiformis is rarely seen in American blacks and some investigators have postulated that this finding may be due to the decreased frequency of HLA-A1 and -B8 in American blacks compared with Caucasians (American blacks: HLA-A1 = 15.3%, HLA-B8 = 10.7%; Caucasian: HLA-A1 = 26.4%, HLA-B8 = 18.3%). This report describes two American blacks with dermatitis herpetiformis and reports the results of HLA typing of these subjects for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ antigens. HLA typing revealed that neither patient expressed HLA-A1 or -B8; however, both patients did express the class II antigens most frequently seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, HLA-DR3 and -DQw2. Comparison of HLA class II antigen frequency in normal American blacks and Caucasians reveals a similar frequency of HLA-DR3 and -DQw2 (American blacks: HLA-DR3 = 27.6%, HLA-DQw2 = 40.9%; Caucasian: HLA-DR3 = 22.6%, HLA-DQw2 = 32.9%). These data confirm the importance of the HLA class II region in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis. In addition, these data suggest that the rare occurrence of dermatitis herpetiformis in American blacks is not due to the decreased frequency of the HLA class I antigens -A1 and/or -B8 but rather is related to differences in the HLA class II region not detected by routine HLA typing.\r"

The semantic differences in the use of the designation \"lupus pernio\" are such that American dermatologists may not consider patients with nasal rim papules of sarcoidosis to have lupus pernio. During a 12-month period, we referred each new patient with sarcoidosis and nasal rim lesions for direct and indirect laryngoscopy. Three of our four patients had sarcoidosis of the upper respiratory tract. We recommend a large prospective study to assess the incidence of this disorder in patients with nasal rim lesions of sarcoidosis. Until such a study is undertaken, however, we believe that consideration should be given to otolaryngologic examination of these patients, regardless of their symptoms.\r"

We describe our findings in 12 patients with scleroderma and silicosis. The exposure time to silica dust was between 3 and 34 years; the interval between the beginning of exposure and the onset of scleroderma averaged 27.3 years (range 9 to 40 years). Antinuclear antibodies in titers between 80 and 10,240 with nucleolar and/or speckled patterns were found in 10 patients, antibodies against double-stranded DNA in three, Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) in three, and anticentromere antibodies in five. The following markers of collagen metabolism were increased in serum: beta-galactosidase in 12 patients, laminin peptide-P1 in 10 patients, N-terminal procollagen type III peptide in 10, and urinary sialic acid excretion in 7. We propose that crystalline particles of silica less than 5 microns may be phagocytosed by macrophages and release lymphokines and monokines, which activate fibroblasts and enhance their collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. In addition, silica may act as an adjuvant to increase immune reactivity.\r"

Punctate keratoses of the palms and soles and keratotic pits of the palmar creases are similar in size, number of lesions per palm, aggravation by trauma, and predominance in blacks and in men. These entities are different in appearance, distribution, age at onset, prevalence, symptoms, and prognosis. Punctate keratosis of the palms and soles and keratotic pits of the palmar creases should be considered independent entities. To help eliminate confusion, we propose that punctate keratoses refer only to the hyperkeratotic papules scattered diffusely in the palms and occasionally in the soles and that keratotic pits of the palmar creases refer only the hyperkeratotic, conical depressions confined to the palmar creases.\r"

Erythema nodosum migrans was characterized by markedly thickened and fibrotic septae, marked capillary proliferation (like granulation tissue), and massive granulomatous reaction (with giant cells) along the borders of the widened septa. Hemorrhage was rare, and phlebitis was not seen. Chronic erythema nodosum showed mild septal change, little fibrosis, and lymphohistiocytic perivascular inflammation with only focal granulomatous formation. Phlebitis and hemorrhage were common. The condition termed erythema nodosum migrans has many of the same clinical features as chronic erythema nodosum, and we think this term is preferable to migratory panniculitis. We believe that there are sufficient clinical and histopathologic features to justify considering erythema nodosum migrans as a unique clinicopathologic entity.\r"

Three patterns of expression are found in the skin: (1) in cells in an angiocentric pattern around superficial vessels, (2) in early reparative lesions that result in fibroplasia, and (3) in certain sessile neoplasms. Around superficial vessels factor XIII probably stabilizes fibrin clots and helps to seal superficial wounds. On the basis of patterns of expression in evolving reparative lesions, factor XIII likely has an important but still undefined function in the development of fibroplasia. Factor XIII's proposed role in the promulgation of fibroplasia would be integral to the production of the stromal component of small neoplasms that is known to be associated with factor XIII expression.\r"
