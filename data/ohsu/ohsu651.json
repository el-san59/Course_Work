  ".W": "The anticodon has previously been shown to play a role in recognition of certain transfer RNAs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases; however, the extent to which this sequence dictates tRNA identity is generally unknown. To investigate the contribution of the anticodon to the identity of Escherichia coli methionine and valine tRNAs, in vitro transcripts of these tRNAs were prepared that contained normal and interchanged anticodon sequences. Transcripts containing wild-type tRNA sequences were excellent substrates for their respective cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and were effectively discriminated against by a variety of noncognate enzymes. The mutant tRNAs produced by switching the anticodon sequences lost their original tRNA identity and assumed an identity corresponding to the acquired anticodon sequence. These results indicate that the anticodon contains sufficient information to distinguish methionine and valine tRNAs with high fidelity.\r"

From 99 to 100 percent pure bone marrow cells expressing the CD34 phenotypic marker were obtained. These cells were devoid of mature myeloid or T cell surface and intracellular markers as analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry. HIV-1 particles were detected by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity and transmission electron microscopy 40 to 60 days after infection. Viral particles were predominantly observed assembling and accumulating from within intracellular membranes, while phenotypically the cells were observed to have differentiated into CD4+ monocytes. These studies have important implications in understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1 as well as the possible cause of certain of the observed hematologic abnormalities in HIV-1 infection. They also indicate that the bone marrow may serve as a potentially important reservoir of HIV-1 in the body.\r"

Like other retroviral reverse transcriptases, the HIV-1 enzyme does not correct errors by exonucleolytic proofreading. Measurements with M13mp2-based fidelity assays indicated that the HIV-1 enzyme, isolated either from virus particles or from Escherichia coli cells infected with a plasmid expressing the cloned gene, was exceptionally inaccurate, having an average error rate per detectable nucleotide incorporated of 1/1700. It was, in fact, the least accurate reverse transcriptase described to date, one-tenth as accurate as the polymerases isolated from avian myeloblastosis or murine leukemia viruses, which have average error rates of approximately 1/17,000 and approximately 1/30,000, respectively. DNA sequence analyses of mutations generated by HIV-1 polymerase showed that base substitution, addition, and deletion errors were all produced. Certain template positions were mutational hotspots where the error rate could be as high as 1 per 70 polymerized nucleotides. The data are consistent with the notion that the exceptional diversity of the HIV-1 genome results from error-prone reverse transcription.\r"

These 15 patients were all characterized by colicky abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, with a mean duration of eight months. Ultrasonographic examination was falsely positive for gallstones in one third (5/15) of the patients, and further diagnostic evaluation in the remaining two thirds (10/15) failed to define a clear-cut surgical problem. All 15 patients ultimately had operation on the basis of symptoms. Every patient reported resolution of preoperative symptoms at short-term follow-up (four to eight weeks). Seven patients available for long-term follow-up (ten to 27 months) reported complete symptomatic resolution. The postoperative outcome failed to correlate reliably with gallbladder histology, bile cultures, and results of diagnostic testing. There was no mortality, and morbidity was limited to three patients. This series confirms previous reports of a small set of relatively young, healthy patients having chronic disabling symptoms of gallbladder disease in the absence of gallstones. Our results suggest that the most reliable factor predicting a successful outcome of cholecystectomy in these patients was the presence of severe biliary colic.\r"

The study, which lasted seven weeks, began with a single-blind two-week placebo lead-in period, followed by a four-week double-blind treatment phase, and concluded with a one-week single-blind placebo washout period. Of 24 patients included in the analysis of efficacy, seven received one Tenoretic 50 tablet per day (atenolol, 50 mg; chlorthalidone, 25 mg), nine received one Tenoretic 100 tablet per day (atenolol, 100 mg; chlorthalidone, 25 mg), and eight received placebo. Supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure (mean +/- SD) decreased from 154 +/- 15.2/102 +/- 4.6 mm Hg during the baseline period to 128 +/- 8.5/85 +/- 4.0 mm Hg during treatment in the group receiving Tenoretic 100, from 153 +/- 12.6/104 +/- 5.4 mm Hg to 137 +/- 4.5/91 +/- 4.4 mm Hg in the group receiving Tenoretic 50, and from 150 +/- 11.9/101 +/- 1.6 mm Hg to 145 +/- 11.6/93 +/- 5.1 mm Hg in the group receiving placebo. Reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the active treatment groups were significantly greater than the pressure reductions in the group receiving placebo (P less than .05 to .1). The combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone was well tolerated, and in no case was treatment discontinued because of side effects. This study showed that one tablet per day of either Tenoretic 50 or Tenoretic 100 is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.\r"

The spectrum of disease ranges from mild, asymptomatic hypothyroidism to severe myxedema, and the disorder is associated with both obstructive and central types of sleep apnea. A variety of factors may be involved, including upper airway obstruction with or without obesity, and alterations in ventilatory drive. The definitive therapy is thyroid hormone replacement, which has been shown to diminish or completely eliminate apneic episodes and arterial oxygen desaturation, as well as to effect many improvements in sleep patterns and overall sleep efficiency. The incidence of thyroid deficiency states in patients with sleep apnea syndrome is not known, but it seems reasonable to evaluate thyroid function in all patients. Thyroid replacement therapy seems logical for the treatment of sleep apnea in patients with previously unrecognized subclinical hypothyroidism. Much remains to be learned about the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea syndromes associated with thyroid hormone deficiency, and further studies are needed.\r"

The tumor predominantly affects blacks during the fourth decade, and shows no sex predilection. Tracheobronchial GCM most commonly produces cough and chest pain, with focal consolidation or atelectasis shown on chest x-ray films. Extraesophageal mediastinal GCM produces few or no symptoms, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of a posterior mediastinal mass. Computerized tomography is helpful in evaluating the extent of the lesion, defining its relationship to adjacent structures, and planning the therapeutic approach. The diagnosis of tracheobronchial GCM usually can be made by bronchoscopy and/or biopsy. Treatment remains controversial, but most studies suggest surgical or endoscopic resection as the treatment of choice. The prognosis of intrathoracic GCM is good but is dependent upon complete removal.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and reproducible model of scoliosis in the rat without producing direct trauma to the spine, in order to both provide a system for the study of human scoliosis and to ultimately study the conditions under which distraction-induced trauma might occur. Right lateral curvatures were produced in three groups of rats (N = 36, 59, 25) at 18-21 days of age by suturing the inferior angle of the scapula to the ipsilateral bony pelvis. In the first group of animals, it was found that a minimum period of 6 weeks of tethering was required in order to produce permanent structural curvatures after release of the tethering sutures. In the second group of rats, a number of morphologic and histologic changes characteristic of human scoliosis were noted, including apical wedging, deviation of the apical spinous process, pelvic asymmetry, rib hump deformity, vertebral rotation, displacement of the nucleus pulposus, disorganized columnization of disc cartilage cells, and an increased number of Type I muscle fibers in paravertebral muscle on the convex side of the curve. Finally, in the third group of rats, a mild spasticity was seen in the ipsilateral hindlimb in approximately one-third of the animals with curvatures greater than 40 degrees. This spasticity was not associated with a change of latency or amplitude of the somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP). Each curvature group displayed SSEP characteristics that were not statistically different from unoperated control animals. These results indicate the validity of this model system for the study of scoliosis, and, in particular, its usefulness for the study of operative-induced trauma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both the phone and clinical interventions were designed to increase patients' perceived susceptibility to complications of the LBP, seriousness of the complications, and benefits and costs of action through a follow-up referral appointment. Other factors predicting compliance included persistence of pain symptoms, previous treatment of LBP by a health care provider, and an unmet need for child care.\r"

All patients were found to have greater than 50% encroachment of the spinal canal and a preoperative kyphosis of 21.8 degrees. At follow-up 81% of patients with incomplete neurological lesions improved at least one Frankel Grade. Residual encroachment on the spinal canal was 4.6% and at follow-up the kyphotic angle was 17.1 degrees. Complications included one anterior graft loosening (not requiring revision), three loosened rods, only one of which required revision, and one fractured Harrington rod which did not require revision. The authors conclude that this technique is an effective and safe method for treating unstable thoracolumbar injuries and is recommended if anterior instrumentation is unavailable.\r"

The structural changes in the arterial wall that occur during pregnancy may predispose women to this complication of pregnancy. In this study, two young women, who had none of the characteristics of Marfan's syndrome, were operated upon for dissection of the ascending aorta. The first patient was in the 35th week of gestation and a cesarean section was performed prior to replacement of the ascending aorta. In the second patient, diagnosis of dissection and severe aortic regurgitation occurred in the postpartum period. Knowledge of this albeit relatively rare complication of pregnancy may assist the clinician in diagnosing and referring patients early for surgical treatment that, in most instances, may save the lives of both mother and fetus.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-three consecutive patients who underwent primary orthotopic hepatic transplantation were treated, after transplantation, with prophylactic immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cyclosporine, prednisone and azathioprine. Weekly percutaneous biopsies were performed to diagnose rejection rapidly. Rejection was treated using a sequential multidrug therapeutic approach based on histologic findings. Mild rejection was initially treated with steroids; moderate to severe rejection was initially treated with steroids; moderate to severe rejection was treated with Minnesota antilymphoblast globulin (mALG) or OKT3 monoclonal antibody (Orthoclone, Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.), or both. The one year actuarial survival rate for adults was 80 per cent and for children, 70 per cent. The incidence of biopsy-proved rejection was 75 per cent in adults and 80 per cent in children; however, the rejection was relatively easily reversed in both groups using biopsy-guided multimodal therapy. In 21 of 22 patients treated with steroids alone, rejection was reversed. Forty-one patients with moderate to severe rejection required treatment with mALG or OKT3, or both; in 38, rejection was resolved, and in three, chronic rejection required retransplantation. The incidence of bacterial, fungal and viral infections was high after transplantation and was further exacerbated by antirejection therapy requiring mALG Or OKT3, or both. Although the rate of infections was high, most were easily treated with antimicrobial agents. Thus, triple drug immunoprophylaxis followed by biopsy-guided antirejection therapy provided effected treatment of rejection without promoting fatal infections.\r"

All of the patients were 75 years of age or older at the time of operation. Abdominal surgical procedures were performed upon 49, and vaginal hysterectomies were performed upon the remaining 61. Among patients undergoing abdominal procedures, three deaths occurred; among those undergoing vaginal hysterectomies, one patient died (6.2 versus 1.6 per cent). Morbidity was high among both groups (43.5 per cent, abdominal group). Patients undergoing the vaginal procedure stayed in the hospital fewer days (9.6 versus 14.5 days). From this data, it is concluded that, if there is a clear indication for surgical procedure, it should be performed, regardless of the age of the patient, if there is no equal or superior medical alternative and if there is no absolute contraindication to anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and twenty patients with clinical stage I, II, or III carcinoma of the breast who presented for mastectomy were prospectively evaluated for hepatic metastases with abdominal sonography and routinely available liver enzymes (LE). Both abdominal ultrasound (US) and LE were assessed. There were two false-positive sonogram, both with normal enzymes, in patients with Stage I and II. There was one positive sonogram at presentation in a patient with Stage III, confirmed by needle biopsy, with a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation. The metastatic yield was low with ultrasound, but other findings were revealed. LE were not useful in the preoperative diagnosis of hepatic metastases, demonstrating a low specificity. Thirty-three patients demonstrated abnormalities of Le. Twenty-seven of 33 had elevation of a single enzyme, LDH being the most common. Three patients had an elevation of four enzymes preoperatively. Hepatic metastases were not diagnosed in these three patients preoperatively on ultrasound or biopsy. The patients were observed with physical examination (PE) and LE for a mean of 26 months. During the follow-up study, 0.9 per cent of the patients with Stage I, 3.4 per cent with Stage II and 12.5 per cent with Stage III had hepatic metastases develop. In patients with these metastases, involvement of the liver was suggested by elevated LE In 66 per cent, on PE in 42 per cent and by history in 28 per cent. LE were the first indication of liver involvement in two patients. We are in agreement with previous authors for abandonment of hepatic imaging in the preoperative assessment because of the low yield for metastases. Forty-eight thousand dollars would have have been spent on this cohort ot diagnose one instance of hepatic metastasis preoperatively. US may be efficacious in the subgroup of patients with grossly elevated LE or a PE suggestive of hepatic involvement. Those patients who demonstrate metastases by us should have histologic confirmation if treatment would thereby be altered.\r"

The differential diagnosis of retinal arterial macroaneurysms include retinal telangiectasia, angiomatosis retinae, venous macroaneurysms, background diabetic retinopathy, and cavernous hemangioma. The clinical characteristics of the reported cases are summarized, and our series of 60 patients is presented. The natural history of most macroaneurysms is spontaneous involution without loss of vision. However, visual loss may occur secondary to macular edema, exudate, hemorrhage and neurosensory retinal detachment, and photocoagulation may expedite visual recovery. Photocoagulation treatment may be applied directly to the macroaneurysm, indirectly by surrounding the macroaneurysm, or as a combination of these two methods.\r"

Isolated inferior oblique muscle palsy, although anatomically enigmatical, is also known to ophthalmologists. When a patient with an oblique muscle palsy chooses to fixate with the paretic eye, characteristic patterns of motility may be obscured. Patients with superior oblique muscle palsy or isolated inferior oblique muscle palsy who habitually fixate with the paretic eye, may present with limited elevation or depression respectively. In each case, limited motility exists secondary to decreased innervational input to the contralateral antagonist of the paretic muscle, or to a mechanical restriction caused by prolonged contracture of the yoke of the paretic muscle. Inhibitional palsy of the contralateral antagonists and the fallen and rising eye syndromes may present diagnostic dilemmas unless the underlying oblique muscle palsy is recognized. Proper diagnosis may be obtained with three clinical tests; the 3-step test, the comparison of ductions to versions, and forced ductions.\r"

  ".W": "Variceal hemorrhage is frequently a lethal event. Mortality among patients who have bled is high, with survival over the short term of only 25% to 50%. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 177 patients in whom variceal bleeding was treated with variceal sclerosis during a 5-year period from 1981 to 1986. All patients were treated by freehand injection of 25% sodium morrhuate with 35% dextrose, 4 ml per injection, through a fiberoptic endoscope. Of this group, 46 patients were treated with sclerosis followed by liver transplantation (group 1). These were compared to 36 nonalcoholic Child's class B and C patients treated with sclerosis alone (group 2). Survival at 4 years was poor in group 2 (17%). Liver failure and continued gastrointestinal bleeding were the most frequent causes of death. Survival among the liver-transplant group was significantly better (73%, p less than 0.001). Causes of death in this group were primarily due to sepsis, often in the setting of acute graft rejection. Group 1 patients were younger (39.8 +/- 10.8 vs 49.8 +/- 16.5 years, p less than 0.01); this difference is influenced by the deliberate selection of younger patients for liver transplantation. We conclude that sclerotherapy followed by liver transplantation significantly improves survival compared to conventional therapy in selected patients with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. Donor organ availability will seriously limit the applicability of this approach to patients with bleeding esophageal varices.\r"

Four had hepatic metastases, one had a tumor in a peripancreatic lymph node, two had resectable intrahepatic and intraduodenal gastrinomas, and in three the primary tumor was not found. Acutely, SMS 201-995 decreased acid secretion and restored the BAO/MAO ratio to normal in eight of eight patients. Basal and secretin-stimulated gastrin responses were suppressed but not normalized in eight of eight patients. Suppression of endogenous gastrin restored responsiveness to exogenous gastrin. Treatment for up to 12 months with SMS 201-995 controlled symptoms in six of eight patients, suppressed serum gastrin in three of five, and suppressed acid secretion in three of three patients. Treatment with SMS 201-995 in three patients for 5 months decreased tumor secretion of gastrin and diminished basal acid secretion, an effect that persisted in two of three patients 48 hours after withdrawal of SMS. In patients with metastatic disease who had high levels of gastrin, SMS treatment for 5 to 12 months did not inhibit tumor growth or decrease gastrin levels. SMS treatment arrested progression of tumor growth only in patients who had a reduction in gastrin and gastric acid secretion. We conclude that SMS may be useful in the management of gastrinoma patients by decreasing hypersecretion of gastrin and gastric acid and, over a longer term, may even change tumor capacity to release gastrin and gastric acid secretion. SMS may thus be useful as a palliative agent and as an adjunct to conventional treatment of the gastrinoma syndrome. SMS does not appear to shrink tumor mass in patients with very high basal gastrin levels.\r"

All patients received standard mechanical bowel preparation; perioperative parenteral cefoxitin (group A) or preoperative oral neomycin and erythromycin, in addition to perioperative cefoxitin (Group B), were also given. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, associated diseases, and primary diagnosis. Wound infections developed in nine of 169 (5%) group B patients and in 15 of 141 (11%) group A patients. Stratification by type of operative procedure revealed that the rectal resections involved the highest rate of infection in group A (22%) and in group B (11%). In patients requiring intraperitoneal colon resection, the rates of wound sepsis were similar (3% in both groups). Analysis of length of operation revealed that in operations lasting 215 minutes or more the infection rate was 12%; in those lasting less than 215 minutes the rate was 4%. Patients with rectal resection and operative times of 215 minutes or more had a wound infection rate of 19% compared to 2% (p less than 0.05) in those with shorter nonrectal operations. Group B patients with the longer rectal operations had lower infection rates (11%) than group A patients (27%), while there was no difference among those who had shorter operations. Intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group B patients. Postoperative wound infection is associated with length of operation and location of colon resection and can be significantly lowered by a combination of oral and parenteral antibiotics.\r"

We report our experience with two additional children with jaundice secondary to pancreatitis and review the literature on this problem. Laboratory tests are often of little diagnostic value, and a high index of suspicion is essential for correct diagnosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is emerging as an extremely useful diagnostic study in these patients. The surgical management of this uncommon pediatric illness remains controversial.\r"

Recommendation for biopsy was made on the basis of the ultrasonographic finding of a nonpalpable mass or an area of architectural distortion, or in the presence of equivocal physical findings if sonomammography demonstrated a solid or an anechoic mass. Sonomammography was performed in the operating room, just before anticipated biopsy, with a hand-held high-resolution scanner. When the suspicious area was imaged and its precise location noted, the breast was then prepared and draped in the usual manner, and a biopsy was performed. If the suspicious area could not be easily localized after the incision was made and the breast explored, the transducer was \"gowned\" and used directly in the wound to help find the lesion. This technique has proven effective and accurate. In selected patients ultrasonography may be used as well as, or instead of, x-ray needle localization for the precise excision of nonpalpable breast lesions, excluding calcifications.\r"

  ".U": "89044578\r", 
  ".W": "The intestinal tract plays a central role in the protein catabolic response after injury and infection. The mucosa utilizes glutamine and thus spares glucose--presumably sparing this essential fuel source for tissues with an obligate glucose requirement. With inadequate nutritional support or prolonged stress, glutamine levels decrease in both the plasma and the tissue pools, which suggests that glutamine deficiency occurs. This is associated in time with atrophy of the gastrointestinal mucosa. This provision of dietary glutamine results in correction of the abnormally low glutamine concentrations and increased cellularity of the gut mucosa. The derangements in the intestinal mucosa associated with starvation, injury, infection, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, lack of enteral feedings, and other stresses are associated with a breakdown in the barrier function of the gut. Both bacteria and their toxins may enter the host from the intestinal lumen. Through interaction with the reticuloendothelial system, cytokines are produced, which stimulate the pituitary-adrenal axis and thus contribute to the stress response. The elaboration of glucocorticoids facilitates proteolysis, thus increasing glutamine release from skeletal muscle for gut repair. Although this homeostatic mechanism appears to aid mucosal repair and support immunologic responses, severe injury or prolonged glutamine deficits do not adequately support intestinal recovery and allow this cycle to become self-perpetuating (Fig 3). Adequate enteral feedings initiated early in the course of a disease appear to maintain adequate gut barrier function. In the frequent circumstance when feeding by this route is inadequate or impossible, glutamine-containing parenteral feedings offer an appropriate alternative therapy for bowel and immunologic support. Glutamine-containing parenteral feedings are associated with increased mucosal cellularity and improved survival after gut injury. Specific hormones also stimulate mucosal growth, and it is anticipated that a combination of hormones and specific nutrients will provide optimal support of the gut mucosa in the severely ill patient.\r"

Patients were grouped with respect to collateral pathways demonstrated preoperatively by TCD: Group 1, good collateralization with an anterior and/or posterior communicating artery ipsilateral to the operative carotid lesion (29 patients, 58%); Group 2, collateral pathways present but impeded by other proximal stenoses (nine patients, 18%); and Group 3, no collateralization identified (nine patients, 18%). Three patients (6%) could not be classified. TCD identified major collateral pathways with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 80% when compared with arteriography. During carotid endarterectomy mean middle cerebral artery velocity, pulsatility index, and stump pressure were higher and the decrease in middle cerebral artery velocity with extracranial carotid artery cross clamping was significantly less among Group 1 patients than among Group 2 and 3 patients (p less than 0.05 for both groups). Group 1 patients required fewer intraoperative carotid artery shunts and developed fewer ischemic electroencephalographic abnormalities than did patients in Groups 2 and 3 (p less than 0.05 for both groups). TCD assessment of cerebral collateralization helps predict hemodynamic consequences of cross clamping during carotid endarterectomy.\r"

One hour before the onset of ischemia, 40 200-300-g Sprague-Dawley rats received intraperitoneal injections of either 1 ml normal saline or 0.4, 0.5, or 0.6 units regular insulin in 1 ml normal saline. Rats were then intubated and ventilated with 1-1.5% halothane. The aortic arch was exposed, and snares were placed on the innominate, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries. A 20-minute occlusion was begun, and anesthesia was discontinued. Baseline plasma glucose concentration was similar (p = 0.48, Student's t test) in both groups, but it subsequently was significantly lower in the 0.4 unit insulin-treated group up to 4 hours after occlusion (p less than or equal to 0.0035, Student's t test). Neurologic deficit was scored on a 50-point scale (0 = normal, 50 = severe deficit) 1, 4, 18, and 24 hours after occlusion.

Survival was significantly higher (p = 0.001) in the 0.4 unit insulin-treated (1.7 unit/kg dose) group than in the saline-treated group.

  ".W": "ATN is a deleterious problem in the outcome of kidney transplantation. This complication is usually related to multiple factors including donor parameters, surgical technique, ischemic time, and recipient variables. In order to develop prophylactic measures, out of 430 kidney transplants performed in our Department, a series of 90 consecutive cadaveric renal allografts has been considered in this study. The overall incidence of IGNF was 23/90 (25.5%). Kidneys from MOD revealed a lower rate of IGNF (7/35 = 20%) when compared with organs from SOD (16/55 = 29%, P = NS). No difference was noted when kidneys were removed together with heart and/or liver and/or pancreas. Out of the donor factors, only CID was significant (17 +/- 9 hours in IGNF v 11 +/- 10 hours in patients with IGF, P = less than .05). Analysis of data concerning the fate of paired kidneys revealed two cases of IGNF in both kidneys from the same donor v 14 cases of IGNF in only one of the two paired grafts (P = NS). We conclude that: 1. Donor factors are clearly associated with a minority of IGNF. 2. The introduction of multiorgan procurement programs does not complicate early function. 3. Recipient factors (immunological events and intraoperative fluid management) provides important additive effects on initial graft nonfunction.\r"

It sensitivity in detecting cancer is at least equivalent to that of core biopsies, in part because several areas of the prostate may be sampled in a relatively atraumatic fashion. Few complications are encountered. Adequate performance of aspiration biopsy of the prostate requires experience and diligence, both by the urologist, in obtaining adequate specimens, and by the processing laboratory and pathologist, in interpreting these specimens. It is hoped that aspiration biopsy will lead to the early diagnosis of prostatic cancer, effecting lower morbidity, reduced hospital cost, greater ease in performing radical prostatectomy, and more accurate techniques for predicting the prognosis in affected patients.\r"

For some conditions, ultrasound may not be an appropriate diagnostic modality. It is the responsibility of the physician to decide whether office ultrasonography is of value. As the equipment is assimiliated into the diagnostic armamentarium, more information on the cost effectiveness and efficacy of office ultrasound for the urologist will become available. Ultrasonography should be performed by the clinician only after appropriate training. Office-based, urologist-operated ultrasound should not replace the proper evaluation of the patient by a radiologist who is trained specifically to make diagnoses using this modality. However, for quick, efficient evaluation of the patient to uncover a disease process, office ultrasonography may supplement the information available through routine history, physical examination, and laboratory studies.\r"

The study can better serve the child and the family in this setting. We have shown that office ultrasound is an excellent primary screening modality, being both practical and accurate. The portable ultrasound machines now available should permit widespread use of office ultrasonography. However, office studies are not intended to replace studies with the more sophisticated and costly ultrasound machines used in radiology departments, only to complement them. We believe the primary uses of in-office examination in children at present are evaluating for detrusor thickness, residual urine volume, bladder capacity, hydronephrosis, and hydroureter; postoperative follow-up of hydronephrosis; screening for sibling uropathology; screening for occult uropathology in cases of gross hematuria; and study of voiding dysfunction or urinary infection. Experience has taught us that the better we become in performing inoffice ultrasound examinations, the better we use ancillary radiologic tests.\r"

  ".W": "Since the development of the first purpose-built flexible cystoscope in 1984, flexible cystoscopy has become an accepted diagnostic and therapeutic modality. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 10 per cent of practicing urologists are already familiar with this technology. The flexible cystoscope has markedly extended the urologist's ability to examine the bladder, and it has become a valuable adjunct to the rigid cystoscope. Although the operation of this instrument is vastly different from that of its rigid counterpart, with practice, the technique can be learned. After experience is obtained with diagnostic flexible cystoscopy, the urologist will likely prefer this new instrument for bladder inspection, as it provides for a more thorough yet less morbid and less expensive examination. In the future, the development of improved and smaller instrumentation will further extend the therapeutic indications for flexible cystoscopy. Indeed, advances in laser technology are already providing the urologist with 300- to 600-micron (0.9 to 1.8F) flexible probes capable of incision (KTP laser), fulguration (Nd:YAG laser), and stone disintegration (tunable dye laser). Lastly, the skills obtained in using the flexible cystoscope are all readily applicable to the development of dexterity with the already available flexible nephroscope and the more recently developed flexible ureteroscope.\r"

The two most commonly employed drugs in the United States are either papaverine alone or various combinations of papaverine and phentolamine. Patients with organic and mixed impotence are best suited for injection treatment, but selected patients with psychogenic impotence also benefit from therapy. After the patient is selected for injection therapy, he undergoes a series of trial injections in the physician's office. The incidence of priapism will be minimized if the initially administered doses are low and the patient is titrated to an appropriate dose level. Uncontrolled trials have revealed that injection treatment produces a satisfactory erection in 65 to 100 per cent of patients for a follow-up period of as long as 2 years with minimal side effects, but the dropout rate is high. If priapism does occur, it almost always responds readily to treatment with aspiration, low doses of an alpha-adrenergic agent, or both. The other common side effects are bruising or ecchymosis and nodule formation at the injection site. This latter complication has not been noted to cause significant abnormal penile curavature necessitating cessation of the program.\r"

The obvious difficulty is the lack of overall significance of this problem: patients with urethral syndrome do not die of their disease. More serious causes of urinary frequency, dysuria, and suprapubic discomfort must be excluded. A combination of a careful history, physical examination, inspection of the urine, urine culture, urine cytology, and cystourethroscopy with biopsy will make the diagnosis. One's personal bias about the etiology will often direct the evaluation. Selective usage of suppressive antibiotics along with reassurance and careful follow-up will prove effective in treating these patients. With greater understanding of lower urinary tract infections and the neurologic innervation of the bladder and urethra, it would seem appropriate for us to continue to develop a better understanding of the urethral syndrome, its etiology, and a more effective treatment rationale. A systematic approach must be maintained in the evaluation of these patients so that an appropriate treatment can be devised.\r"

This trend has continued, with even more cases being done as office procedures. These consist of circumcision, meatotomy for stenosis, lysis of labial adhesions, and meatal dilatation after hypospadias repair. If an operation is done with attention to detail, it can be completed with minimal complications, although, as evidenced with circumcision, those that do occur can carry significant morbidity and even cause death. The primary limiting factor for performing procedures in the office is the comfort of the patient. The procedure, by necessity, has to entail minimum pain and great ease in obtaining hemostasis and requires a cooperative patient and family. Therefore, even as the number of operations performed on an out-patient basis increases, there are a finite number of cases suitable for the office.\r"

Prostatic tissue from transurethral resection (TUR) was subjected to routine pathologic examination and stained for PAP. PAP level increased above reference range and up to several-fold in 12 of 22 patients (54.5%) by EIA and in 22.7 percent by EA. The increase in PAP correlated positively with the prostate size estimated by digital palpation (R = 0.82, P less than 0.001). There was no definite correlation between the histologic parameters studied and the increase in PAP. No day-to-day variation in PAP level was detected in 8 other patients when samples were taken at 7 AM for three successive days. For proper comparison of PAP value, we suggest that sampling time should be fixed and specimens should be taken before prostatic manipulation.\r"

  ".W": "COGNITIVE FUNCTION. There is reasonably good evidence that mental and motor developmental test scores are lowered among infants with iron deficiency anemia. Although the research on cognitive function in iron-deficient older children and adults is sparse and diverse, it suggests that there may be alterations in attentional processes associated with iron deficiency. Iron therapy has not yet been shown effective in completely correcting the observed disturbances. Although some aspects of cognitive function seem to change with iron therapy, lower developmental, IQ, and achievement test scores have still been noted after treatment. The mechanisms explaining the variety of behavioral ill effects of iron-deficiency anemia in widely different age groups are still unknown. It is possible that they are due to changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission, but the biochemical bases are not yet completely understood. NONCOGNITIVE DISTURBANCES. A variety of noncognitive alterations during infant developmental testing has also been observed, including failure to respond to test stimuli, short attention span, unhappiness, increased fearfulness, withdrawal from the examiner, and increased body tension. Exploratory analyses suggest that such behavioral abnormalities may account for poor developmental test performance in infants with iron deficiency anemia. These studies indicate the fruitfulness of examining noncognitive aspects of behavior, such as affect, attention and activity, in addition to specific cognitive processes. ACTIVITY AND WORK CAPACITY. There has been a steady accumulation of evidence that iron deficiency anemia limits maximal physical performance, submaximal endurance, and spontaneous activity in the adult, resulting in diminished work productivity with attendant economic losses. The relative importance of central and peripheral mechanisms underlying these effects, the extent to which anemia or iron deficiency separate from anemia is responsible, and the counterpart in infants and children remain to be established. This review has examined recent evidence from research on central nervous system biochemistry and from human studies that iron deficiency adversely affects behavior by impairing cognitive function, producing noncognitive disturbances, and limiting activity and work capacity. The body of research taken as a whole provides increasingly persuasive arguments for intensifying efforts to prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia.\r"

The advances of molecular biology have provided a biosynthetic Ep, a potent tool for correction and prevention of the anemia of renal failure. However, new problems often arise as new treatments become available. The rapid improvement in hematocrit and the resultant lowering in plasma volume may affect dialysis clearances in hemodialysis patients. Since the well-being and appetite of the patients improves as the hematocrit rises, newer methods to increase the weekly dialysis clearances will be needed to prevent the complication of underdialysis in these patients.\r"

Included were 16 patients with empyemas and one each with a sterile hematoma and transudate. In nine of the patients, previous surgical chest tube drainage had been unsuccessful. The majority of collections were treated with a 12- or 14-French catheter and closed underwater seal drainage. Twelve (80%) of the 15 patients who had an adequate trial of guided drainage were cured. Propyliodone oil suspension contrast sinography after catheter placement showed two clinically unsuspected bronchopleural fistulas. Although an extensive multilocular pleural collection was a contraindication to percutaneous catheter drainage, the thick fibrous peel of a chronic empyema was not. Drainage of pleural fluid collections with radiographic guidance ensures proper catheter placement and is successful in a high percentage of cases.\r"

Radiologic findings and their usefulness in differentiating microcystic from mucinous subtypes were assessed. The number of cysts within the tumors (more than six in microcystic adenomas and six or fewer in mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas) and the diameter of the majority of cysts within the tumor (less than or equal to 2 cm in microcystic adenomas and greater than 2 cm in mucinous tumors) were the most helpful radiologic findings in differentiating tumor types. Calcification was present in 38% of microcystic adenomas, 18% of mucinous cystadenomas, and 8% of mucinous cystadenocarcinomas by CT. Calcification was not definitely identified on any of the sonograms. A central scar was identified in only two (13%) of 16 microcystic adenomas. Blind retrospective review was often able to correctly classify tumors as either microcystic (CT, 93%; sonography, 78%) or mucinous (CT, 95%; sonography, 93%). All tumors with a typical appearance on either CT or sonography were categorized correctly. Cystic pancreatic tumors may be difficult to prospectively separate from other types of pancreatic cysts. Assuming a cystic neoplasm is present, it often can be classified correctly as microcystic or mucinous (macrocystic) by using the above criteria.\r"

Either a normal delivery occurred or surgical and/or pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis was available in all cases. Fifty-five women had normal intrauterine pregnancies, 22 had ectopic pregnancies, seven had blighted ova, and six had missed abortions. All 55 normal intrauterine pregnancies were detected by endovaginal sonography, while only 11 (20%) were diagnosed by transabdominal sonography. The yolk sac, fetal pole, and fetal heart motion were seen as early as 34 days from the last menstrual period with endovaginal sonography, compared with 42 days with transabdominal sonography. Fetal heart motion was detected with endovaginal sonography in fetal poles with a crown-rump length of 3 mm or greater, whereas the fetal pole had to be at least 6 mm before fetal heart motion could be detected with the transabdominal technique. In the 22 ectopic pregnancies, a specific diagnosis of an extrauterine sac containing a fetal pole with heart motion or yolk sac was possible in three cases with the endovaginal technique, but it was not possible in any case with transabdominal sonography. Both techniques showed that each of the seven patients with final diagnosis of blighted ova had a gestational sac that was 1.7 cm or larger without visualization of the fetal pole or yolk sac. All six missed abortions were detected by endovaginal sonography, but only three were diagnosed on transabdominal sonograms. Our findings show that endovaginal sonography is more sensitive than transabdominal sonography in the detection of early pregnancy and its complications.\r"

  ".W": "The left kidney from a living, related donor is preferred for kidney transplantation because it has a longer renal vein and thus is easier to implant in the recipient. However, anatomic variations in the renal arteries occasionally dictate the choice of the right kidney instead. To determine the influence of angiographic findings on the decision to use the right or the left kidney for transplantation, we assessed the role of preoperative angiography in the evaluation of living, related kidney donors. The records of 81 potential renal donors who underwent arteriography were reviewed. Three patients did not undergo donor nephrectomy, for reasons unrelated to the results of arteriography. Of the remaining 78 patients, two-thirds (52) underwent left nephrectomy as planned. A right nephrectomy was performed in the other 26 donors. In 19 of these 26 patients (24% of the 78 who underwent nephrectomy), the right kidney was chosen because of anatomic variations in the renal arteries seen on arteriography. Right donor nephrectomy was performed in the remaining seven of the 26 patients because of venous or collecting-system variants in the left kidney in three and because of better anatomic compatibility with the recipient in the other four. We conclude that donor angiography will dictate the choice of kidney in approximately one-fourth of prospective renal donors.\r"

Fetal and maternal age, sonographic indication, cyst size and multiplicity, and evolution on serial studies were recorded. Fetal outcome was available in 16 cases by genetic amniocentesis (n = 5) or neonatal clinical records (n = 11). The prevalence of fetal choroid plexus cysts was 0.8% (17/2084) during a 40-month period. All cysts were initially identified on sonograms performed between 14 and 21 weeks. Cysts ranged from 3 to 11 mm in size and were bilateral in four (36%) of 11 cases in which both lateral ventricles were visualized. In nine of 10 cases with serial sonograms 2-21 weeks after the initial study, the cysts were no longer present. One fetus had a small cyst persisting at term. All five cases with genetic amniocentesis had normal chromosomes. The only phenotypic abnormality in the 11 cases with clinical follow-up was a small hemangioma of the chest wall. We conclude that most fetuses with isolated choroid plexus cysts have a normal outcome and that serial sonography for cyst evaluation is not useful in determining fetal prognosis.\r"

Five patients had normal MR scans. Of those with lesions, both Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo and unenhanced STIR scans improved detection and evaluation of spinal tumors over conventional spin-echo methods, particularly T2-weighted spin echo, by providing higher tissue contrast in shorter imaging times. The Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo scans were most helpful in evaluating intradural tumors, whereas STIR sequences were most effective for extradural tumors and bone metastases. In most cases, Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo scans best delineated tumor margins, and the enhancement was helpful in suggesting a cellular or active nature of the lesions. In some cases, the enhancement resulted in a more homogeneous and thus less abnormal-appearing marrow in vertebrae involved by tumor; therefore, a precontrast T1-weighted spin-echo scan is necessary in all patients who are to be studied with Gd-DTPA. A combined approach that uses T1-weighted spin-echo, Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo, and STIR images currently appears optimal for MR imaging of spinal neoplasms. T2-weighted spin-echo images add information only in occasional cases.\r"

The computer measurements were compared with visual interpretation of the 35 mm cineangiograms. The results indicated that visual reports of cineangiograms tend to overestimate the pre-PTCA diameter percent stenosis and to underestimate the post-PTCA residual stenosis in comparison with the computer (p less than 0.001 in bot cases). There was good agreement between geometric and densitometric area percent stenoses calculated by the program on the pre-PTCA digital angiograms (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001, mean of their differences = -0.2 with standard deviation = 6.1). Following PTCA, however, important discrepancies between the two methods existed (r = 0.71, p less than 0.001, mean of their differences = 1.0 with standard deviation = 18.6). Following PTCA (but not pre-PTCA), densitometric evaluation demonstrated a significantly greater mean coefficient of variation between different views (69%) than did the geometric evaluation on the same views (24%). We conclude (1) that visual interpretation of cine coronary angiograms compares poorly with quantitative methods for both the selection of PTCA candidates and the assessment of the results; (2) that the geometric and densitometric characteristics do not agree in describing the degree of post-PTCA residual stenosis; and (3) that after angioplasty, important discrepancies between densitometric evaluation in different views are observed.\r"

Based on previous echocardiographic end-systolic dimension (ESD) and angiographic ejection fraction (EF) correlations, the cohort was divided into group A (21 patients) with ESD greater than or equal to 48 mm and group B (39 patients) with ESD less than 48 mm. Group B had a faster ESD progression (NS) and 19 crossed over to group A. Thirteen patients, all with ESD greater than 48 mm, reached designated end points. One died of cerebral embolism and 12 (age 31.4 +/- 10.6 years) required aortic valve replacement (AVR). Of these, 9 of 12 were asymptomatic and 11 of 12 had significant left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The preoperative ESD of 51.9 +/- 4.1 mm fell to 38.4 +/- 3.6 mm (p less than 0.001) postoperatively and the EF of 43.7 +/- 4.16 increased to 64.9 +/- 5.9 (p less than 0.001). We found (1) the progression was faster than in other series; (2) ESD greater than 48 mm was associated with significant progression; and (3) patients with EF above 40% showed no residual LVD after AVR.\r"

Doppler-determined velocity correlated well with an invasive electromagnetic system. Reproducibility of Doppler variables during three exercise tests was high (coefficient of variation less than 10%) and did not deteriorate appreciably with exercise. Peak velocity (PV) and maximum acceleration (MA) were inversely related to age, the relationship being more significant during exercise, whereas the systolic velocity integral showed no such relationship either at rest or during exercise. Doppler variables showed no difference between sexes, except at high levels of exercise. Beta blockade markedly attenuated the exercise response as shown by significant decreases in both MA and PV during exercise. The Doppler velocity data presented in this study provide a reference against which previously documented changes in exercising ischemic patients can be better related.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction commonly have ST segment depression in the anterior precordial leads. This may reflect either reciprocal changes from the inferior ST elevation or primary ST depression from additional anterior subendocardial ischemia. From a biophysical perspective reciprocal changes should be uniformly anticipated from basic dipole theory. Detection will vary with the size, location, orientation, and electrical intensity of the lesion and with the ECG lead system deployed to register the anterior changes. Alternatively, acute occlusion of the right coronary artery may produce ischemia in the anterior left ventricular wall supplied by a stenotic anterior descending coronary artery. Anterior ischemia may result from the abnormal hemodynamics or the reduced collateral flow produced by acute right coronary artery occlusion. Thus both mechanisms are based on sound physiologic principles. A review of the clinical literature suggests that such patients represent a heterogeneous group. In some instances coexistent anterior ischemia is present, whereas in others the anterior ST depression is the passive reflection of inferior ST elevation augmented in many cases by a large infarct size or more extensive posterobasal or septal involvement.\r"

The role of surgical intervention and its timing remains unresolved. A collaborative study from three institutions was undertaken to examine various clinical outcomes in 46 patients with ventricular septal rupture. No medically treated patient survived hospitalization. Since only surgically treated patients survived, we focused our evaluation on those characteristics that might differentiate surgical survivors from surgical nonsurvivors. Systolic blood pressure, pulse, mean right atrial pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure, and cardiopulmonary bypass time were univariate predictors of hospital survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure, right atrial pressure, and cardiopulmonary bypass time were strongly predictive of survival (p less than 0.05). In addition, taken together systolic blood pressure and right atrial pressure identified a group of persons who wee much more likely to survive surgical intervention. The results of this study may prove useful in predicting the risk of surgical repair in patients with ventricular septal rupture.\r"

The emphasis will be on their relevance in circulatory regulatory processes, especially those of the blood vessels. The alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists that interact with various receptor subtypes are briefly discussed. The control of alpha 2-adrenoceptors concerned with blood pressure regulation is an important target for centrally acting antihypertensive drugs (such as clonidine or alpha-methyldopa). Changes in adrenoceptor density, particularly the down-regulation of beta 1- adrenoceptors (but not beta 2), are found in congestive heart failure. However, the experimental findings about alpha-and beta-adrenoceptors in essential hypertension remain controversial. Finally, the influence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on plasma lipids and carbohydrate metabolism is briefly reviewed. The changes found may be only partly explained on the basis of alpha- or beta-receptor blockade.\r"

Even after 20 years beta-blockers must be selected carefully to suit the patient's needs. This review examines several problems associated with beta-blockade. Generally, beta1-cardioselectivity is considered advantageous, but properties such as partial agonist activity, which limits receptor up-regulation, might be of greater value in reducing the adverse effects associated with abrupt drug withdrawal. Beta-Blockers, either lipophilic or hydrophilic agents, have specific problems: lipophilic drugs provoke adverse central nervous system effects and need careful dose titration; variable gastrointestinal absorption is common with hydrophilic agents, whereas extra care is needed in patients with renal impairment. For most patients, especially those with asymptomatic conditions, once-daily dosing is preferred. For many, the quality of life is of overriding clinical importance. Despite significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advances, the final criteria depend largely on a clinical assessment, improvement in the quality of life, and patient preference. We still await the discovery of an ideal beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent; some of the newer beta-blockers, however have many of the properties that clinicians value.\r"

Unlike classic beta-blockers, celiprolol does not depress cardiac contractility at rest while interfering to a lesser extent with cardiac function during exercise. Furthermore, celiprolol causes systemic vasodilatation, which, in hypertension, is mainly responsible for the blood pressure-reducing effects of the drug. Vasodilatation results from the reduction in vascular resistance of skeletal muscle tissues, but celiprolol also produces dilatation of vascular areas such as the kidney. This prevents a reduction in renal blood flow and consequently the salt and water retention associated with impaired perfusion. It is possible that such hemodynamic changes are dependent not on celiprolol's selective beta1-receptor-blocking properties but on certain additional properties.\r"

An unexpected finding in the canine infarct drug model is the spontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. The beta2-agonist property of celiprolol may account for this observation. In a clinical study celiprolol has bee found to decrease ventricular rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. In the same study, the compound decreased the occurrence of premature ventricular contractions by 50%. Animal and clinical studies demonstrate that celiprolol does not adversely interact wit digitalis glycosides.\r"

Serum cholesterol level also fell from 5.35 to 4.78 mmol/L (p less than 0.01) and was accompanied by a nonsignificant loss of body weight. Lipid electrophoresis showed a nonsignificant increase in the high-density lipid fraction, from 1.2 to 1.7 mmol/L, and a significant decrease in the low-density lipid fraction, from 3.4 to 2.7 mmol/L (p less than 0.01). Serum triglyceride levels also decreased from 1.85 to 1.37 mmol/L (p less than 0.02), and low-density lipid-high-density lipid ratio fell from 3.29 to 2.03 (p less than 0.02). There was an unexpected reduction in serum fibrinogen levels, from 288 to 253 mg/dl (p less than 0.01). Aside from a slight reduction in the fasting blood glucose, there were no other significant changes in the urine or blood parameters, and no adverse drug effects occurred. It is likely that celiprolol's effect in reducing fibrinogen levels may minimize the increase in blood viscosity associated with the hypertensive state, whereas its effects on fibrinogen may herald a reduction in hypertensive complications such as thrombosis or retinal \"cotton wool exudates.\" This warrants further investigation.\"\r"

Sufficient variability exists in electrophysiologic testing as in other clinical methods calling for careful attention to the reproducibility of tachycardia induction in a given patient, lest chance alone mimic beneficial or deleterious effects of antiarrhythmic regimens.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has provided the most objective evidence of silent ischemia, but the phenomenon has also been detected in patients with coronary artery disease through analysis of exercise-induced ischemic ST-segment alterations, scintigraphic myocardial perfusion defects and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. Silent myocardial ischemia frequently occurs in patients with stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction and completely asymptomatic coronary artery disease. In each of these groups, silent ischemia has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiac events. However, it remains unclear whether silent ischemia is directly involved in the occurrence of these events, possibly by provoking ventricular arrhythmias. Only limited data are available on the relation between silent ischemia and arrhythmias in myocardial infarction, vasospastic angina, coronary angioplasty, exercise testing and ambulatory electrocardiography. However, fortuitous ambulatory monitoring coincident with sudden death has detected ischemia associated with lethal arrhythmias in some individual cases. This suggests that an ischemia-arrhythmia association may be important in certain patients at certain times, possibly in combination with other factors.\r"

Most patients who die suddenly initially experience ventricular tachycardia that subsequently degenerates into ventricular fibrillation. Patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death include: survivors of myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction or complex ventricular ectopy, or both; survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly when the event is not associated with an acute myocardial infarction; patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia; and patients with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy, particularly when associated with ventricular ectopy.

PES is sensitive but nonspecific, and Holter is specific but insensitive. A failure to suppress ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) on Holter during drug therapy predicts a poor outcome. A suppression of VPCs by drug therapy, however, does not preclude a poor outcome. If VT is no longer induced by PES during drug therapy, the patients will have a good outcome. A persistent induction of VT during drug therapy, however, does not preclude good outcomes. Therefore some investigators have suggested alternative PES efficacy criteria such as the changes in the rate of induced VT during therapy. Further studies should be conducted to confirm this. Because both methods have values and limitations, a combined use of the 2 methods is recommended to improve the clinician's ability to predict the outcome of antiarrhythmic therapy. Studies designed to prove that 1 method is better than the other may prove futile.\r"

  ".W": "The link between elevated plasma cholesterol levels and coronary atherosclerosis is now well established. During the past decade, results from therapeutic trials indicate that control of hypercholesterolemia does result in lower cardiovascular risk. Many of these results were obtained in hypercholesterolemic, middle-aged men. Comparable data in women are not available but it is inferred that they would also benefit from cholesterol reduction. Results from the Coronary Drug Project, extended over 15 years, indicate that lipid-lowering therapy with niacin for 5 years was associated with a decrease in total mortality as well as mortality from coronary heart disease. In the studies performed for shorter periods (5 to 7 years), therapy lowered only cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but had no beneficial effect on total mortality. A reduction in cardiovascular risk begins to appear 24 to 28 months after the initiation of therapy and continues to accrue thereafter. The relatively uniform results from recent large-scale clinical trials (Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial, Coronary Drug Project, Helsinki Heart Study) indicate that cholesterol reduction, per se, probably explains the lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality observed in these trials. As a result of these trials, recent redefinitions of hypercholesterolemia and more aggressive treatment programs have been recommended. These guidelines stress assessment of all cardiovascular risk factors and recommend individualized care of the patient. To control hypercholesterolemia, conservative measures with diet are recommended before therapy with medication is considered. Recent clinical trial experience indicates that the clinician can have significant impact on atherosclerosis by identifying and treating patients with plasma cholesterol levels in the high-risk range.\r"

  ".W": "Cholesterol is a 27-carbon steroid that is an essential component of the cell membrane, the immediate precursor of steroid hormones, the substrate for the formation of bile acids, and is required for the assembly of very low density lipoprotein in the liver. Because as much as two-thirds of total body cholesterol in patients is of endogenous origin, an effective means to control cholesterogenesis may occur by inhibition of its biosynthesis. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involve the formation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). Early attempts to pharmacologically block cholesterol synthesis focused only on steps later in the biosynthetic pathway and resulted in compounds with unacceptable toxicity. Recent research had identified that HMG CoA reductase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway and is responsible for the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate. Additional research with fungal metabolites identified a series of compounds with potent inhibiting properties for this target enzyme, from which lovastatin was selected for clinical development. A reduction in cholesterol synthesis by lovastatin has been subsequently confirmed in cell culture, animal studies and in humans. A resultant decrease in circulating total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has also been demonstrated in animals and humans. Because hepatic LDL receptors are the major mechanism of LDL clearance from the circulation, further animal research has confirmed that these declines in cholesterol are accompanied by an increase in hepatic LDL receptor activity. Lovastatin effectively diminishes endogenous cholesterol synthesis providing useful therapeutic properties for patients with hypercholesterolemia.\r"

This toxicity is expected based on the critical nature of the target enzyme (HMG CoA reductase) and the magnitude of the dosage levels used. The information reviewed in this paper demonstrates that these adverse findings in animals do not predict significant risk in humans. The reason for this derives from the fact that all the available evidence suggests that the adverse effects observed are produced by an exaggeration of the desired biochemical effect of the drug at high dosage levels. The presence of clear and high no-effect doses for these toxic effects along with the fact that most of the changes observed are clearly mechanism-based (directly attributable to inhibition of mevalonate synthesis) indicate that it is unlikely that similar changes will be observed at the therapeutic dosage levels in humans. This hypothesis is supported by the extensive human safety experience described by Tobert in the following report.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, has been established by numerous studies. At doses of 40 mg administered twice daily, lovastatin produces a mean reduction in total plasma cholesterol of 33%, attributable to a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 41%. The drug also produces a mean increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 9%, and a reduction in the high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio of 44%. The serious reported adverse effects of lovastatin are myopathy (0.5%) and asymptomatic but marked and persistent increases in transaminases (1.9%). Both are reversible when therapy is discontinued. Myopathy has occurred mainly in patients with complicated histories who were receiving concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive drugs, gemfibrozil or niacin. In an ongoing long-term safety study, 744 patients have received lovastatin for an average duration of 2.5 years up to March 1988. Fifteen patients (2.0%) have been withdrawn because of drug-attributable adverse events: raised transaminases (9), skin rash (2), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), myopathy (1) and insomnia (1). No effect of the drug on the human lens has been observed up to the date mentioned above. Lovastatin has been available in the United States since September 1987. By March 1988, the drug had been prescribed for approximately 250,000 patients. This clinical experience has confirmed the tolerability observed in clinical trials. The good adverse-effect profile of lovastatin is thus now supported both by a substantial body of data in patients treated for over 2 years in clinical trials, and by experience in clinical use with a large number of patients since the drug has been available for prescription.\r"

Patients with \"high\" total serum cholesterol (240 to 300 mg/dl) constituted Stratum 1 and patients with \"very high\" total serum cholesterol (greater than 300 mg/dl) constituted Stratum 2. In Stratum 1, patients were randomly assigned to either lovastatin 20 mg nightly or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, and in Stratum 2 to either lovastatin 40 mg nightly or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. In both strata, the lovastatin dose was doubled after 6 weeks if serum cholesterol remained greater than 200 mg/dl. Ninety-two and 93% of the patients doubled their dose in Strata 1 and 2, respectively, resulting in average doses of 38.5 mg/day (Stratum 1) and 77.4 mg/day (Stratum 1) and 77.4 mg/day (Stratum 2) by week 12. The dose of gemifibrozil was kept constant. Lovastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 31 and 42% in Stratum 1 and 2, respectively. The corresponding reductions achieved by gemfibrozil were 13 and 18%. In both strata, as well as in patients with Type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, lovastatin was approximately 2 to 4 times as effective as gemfibrozil in lowering LDL cholesterol. Although both drugs increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, gemfibrozil was 1.5 to 3 times more effective. LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios decreased significantly more during lovastatin therapy. Both drugs reduced serum triglyceride levels, but gemfibrozil was much more effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several risk factors--dyslipidemia induced by NIDDM, obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia--likely contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. The dyslipidemia in NIDDM is characterized by abnormalities in composition and metabolism of very low density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). However, because of the lack of long-term prospective epidemiologic studies, the relative importance of lipoprotein risk factors in the causation of CAD in diabetic patients is not clear. The World Health Organization Multinational Study of vascular disease in diabetics observed increased prevalence of CAD in diabetic populations with relatively high levels of plasma cholesterol and supports the concept that lowering cholesterol levels may significantly reduce coronary risk in NIDDM. To determine the effectiveness of lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, for lowering cholesterol levels, 16 patients with NIDDM and mild to moderate increases in plasma cholesterol were given lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner for 4 weeks. Compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced concentrations of total cholesterol (233 +/- 10 vs 172 +/- 7 mg/dl [standard error of the mean], p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol (140 +/- 9 vs 101 +/- 6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001), and LDL apolipoprotein-B (108 +/- 16 vs 80 +/- 16 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). Plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also decreased by 31 and 42%, respectively. Although HDL cholesterol levels did not increase, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased significantly with lovastatin therapy. No adverse effects were noted and glycemic control was well-maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a randomized diltiazem-placebo-controlled therapeutic trial of non-Q-wave AMI confirmed by creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), 126 of 544 patients (23%) exhibited LV hypertrophy using standard voltage criteria. Compared to patients without LV hypertrophy, patients with LV hypertrophy were significantly older (65 vs 60 years, p less than 0.0001) and had smaller peak adjusted CK levels (490 +/- 376 vs 666 +/- 726 IU/liter, p less than 0.001) than patients without LV hypertrophy. Patients with and without LV hypertrophy did not differ significantly in acute mortality during hospitalization, progression to Q waves, reinfarction by CK-MB criteria or angina associated with transient electrocardiographic changes. Compared with patients without LV hypertrophy, those patients with non-Q-wave AMI and LV hypertrophy had a 2-fold higher incidence of reinfarction (24 vs 12%, p less than 0.005) and death (19 vs 9%, p = 0.044) during the first year of follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the relative risk of death and reinfarction during the initial year after AMI was increased by a factor of 1.7 and 2.1 among patients with LV hypertrophy, respectively. It was therefore concluded that, although patients with LV hypertrophy and non-Q-wave AMI have smaller enzymatic infarcts and the same short-term prognosis as do patients without LV hypertrophy, their reinfarction and mortality rates are significantly increased during the first year of follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the same level of arterial pressure, patients with ISH had a high cardiac index (p less than 0.02) and a faster heart rate (p less than 0.05); consequently, total peripheral resistance was decreased (p less than 0.05). Although there was no change in intravascular volume, central blood volume was expanded (p less than 0.02), and the ratio of central to peripheral blood volume was increased (p less than 0.02), thereby indicating peripheral venoconstriction.

Administration was terminated when either vasoconstriction was noted at fluoroscopy or when the maximal acetylcholine concentration was reached. Vascular responses were evaluated by quantitative angiography. All 14 patients had a decrease in coronary lumen size in response to acetylcholine. The mean percentage of vasoconstriction was 37 +/- 24% (p less than 0.001). Combined infusion of nifedipine and the maximal vasoconstricting dose of acetylcholine did not result in a significant reversal of coronary vasoconstriction in all 10 cardiac transplantation patients. It was concluded that acetylcholine is a potent coronary vasoconstrictor in patients who had cardiac transplantation and possibly lacks vasodilating effects in most normal patients without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease, thus suggesting that acetylcholine might not be a suitable pharmacologic agent for testing endothelial cell integrity.\r"

Findings for the first 300 men to complete 1 y on study are presented. After 10 mo of treatment, serum levels in the placebo group showed essentially no change whereas levels in the treated group increased almost 10-fold after 4 mo of treatment. The relationship between change in serum levels are evaluated in regard to body mass index, alcohol consumption, amount of smoking, lipids, and other variables. The results to date clearly indicate that substantial serum response can be achieved with only 15 mg/d and that with this dosage no skin discoloration or other toxicities are observed.\r"

Each trial was divided into two phases, a qualification phase and a test phase. During the qualification phase, subjects with a history of gastrointestinal intolerance to aspirin were randomized to a double-blind crossover treatment with aspirin and placebo (325 mg aspirin per tablet in study 1 and 500 mg aspirin per tablet in study 2), two tablets four times a day for 3 days or until the occurrence of stomach upset. Subjects who reported gastrointestinal symptoms with aspirin and not with placebo qualified to participate in the test phase of the study. They were rerandomized to participate in a three-way crossover study of plain aspirin, tri-buffered aspirin, and placebo in the test phase. Tri-buffered aspirin was associated with an appreciable reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal upset relative to plain aspirin, 34 percentage points in study 1 (p less than 0.001) and 33 percentage points in study 2 (p less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained in the evaluation of the reduction of the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 72 adult patients undergoing 76 upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopies because of GI signs or symptoms were studied for the presence of Campylobacter pylori by culture, histology, and rapid urease determination of gastric antral biopsy specimens. C. pylori was found by culture or histology in all 10 cases of gastric and duodenal ulcer, and in 77% of endoscopies with histologically proven active gastritis. Positive culture for C. pylori was highly correlated pathologically with active gastritis, but not endoscopically, and was rarely seen in the absence of acute inflammation on biopsy. There was no correlation between C. pylori and alcohol ingestion, smoking, age, sex, antibiotics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. The rapid urease test was positive in 70% of cases with positive cultures and 89% with positive cultures or acridine orange stains. Acridine orange-stained histological samples were positive in 97% of cases with positive cultures. In addition, 31% of endoscopies with negative cultures were also positive by acridine orange stain. Acridine orange stain, culture, and urease reaction of antral mucosal biopsies all are effective methods for demonstration of mucosal C. pylori-like organisms. However, of the three methods used, acridine orange staining is positive in the largest group of patients and is the most sensitive method for detecting colonization of gastric antral mucosa. In general, positive urease and culture identify those patients with larger numbers of organisms on the mucosa. Differences in urease and culture positivity from case to case suggest that factors other than numbers of organisms, such as viability and urease levels, affect the results. All these results support a role for C. pylori as an aggressive factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastritis.\r"

Over a period of 6 months, we investigated the effectiveness of cimetropium bromide, a new antimuscarinic compound, in patients with IBS. Forty-eight patients were treated at random and in double-blind fashion with cimetropium bromide (50 mg, tid) or placebo for 6 months. Personal diary cards and monthly check-ups guaranteed the monitoring of symptoms (mainly pain). In addition, personality patterns (MHQ-CBA tests) were obtained for the patients before and after therapy, both to detect possible psychoneurotic traits and to observe the changes in these traits in relation to the changes in pain symptoms. Three patients on placebo and one on cimetropium dropped out. At the end of therapy, pain scores had decreased an average of 16% in the placebo group and 87% in the cimetropium group (p less than 0.01). Twenty patients (87%) on cimetropium versus five patients (24%) on placebo considered themselves to be globally improved (p less than 0.01). The MHQ test showed significant improvement in the anxiety score in the cimetropium group only. The CBA test confirmed a significant decrease in anxiety state (STAI-X-1) after cimetropium treatment. Eleven patients (48%) on cimetropium reported side effects (mainly dry mouth and sleepiness), but none withdrew from the study. The results of this trial indicate that long-term treatment of IBS with cimetropium bromide significantly improves symptoms and associated psychological disorders.\r"

  ".W": "It is becoming evident that IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerular disease, and a frequent cause of end-stage renal failure in both white and Asian populations. Its significance as a public health problem is not known since little epidemiologic research is available in most countries. The apparent geographic variations in the percentage of IgAN in kidney biopsy specimens may reflect different clinical policies for diagnostic tests. As a consequence, the frequency of IgAN cannot be accurately extrapolated from these data for any given population. The highest percentages, reported in Singapore and Japan, may be influenced by the systematic screening of urines in both countries. By contrast, IgAN has been detected rarely in blacks either from the United States or from Africa. However, biopsies are performed infrequently in African patients with only microscopic hematuria. Such ethnic differences may suggest a possible role of genetic factors in the etiology of IgAN. As shown recently in France and Italy, antibiotic therapy of streptococcal infections apparently has not influenced the percentage of IgAN in kidney biopsy specimens. These facts and the rarity of the glomerulonephritis in blacks suggest that infections may not be responsible for the etiology of IgAN. The traditional search for causal agents should be approached more vigorously. It will require innovative epidemiologic efforts to understand the mechanisms by which multiple factors (environmental and genetic) acting together influence the risk of disease.\r"

  ".W": "Two different clinical syndromes might be observed at presentation in most patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN): (1) an acute reversible episode of macroscopic hematuria or (2) asymptomatic urinary abnormalities. Patients in these groups differ by genetic markers, the severity of their histologic lesions, and the rate of progression to renal insufficiency. Macroscopic hematuria is more common in children, and its frequency decreases with increasing age. In our experience, most patients presenting in adulthood with macroscopic hematuria did not have proteinuria or microscopic hematuria prior to the episode of macroscopic hematuria, suggesting the onset of disease was indeed in adulthood. IgAN is not a benign disease. About 20% of patients reach end-stage renal failure after 20 years of clinical disease. Features generally associated with a poor prognosis include older age at onset, no history of recurrent macroscopic hematuria, hypertension, and consistent proteinuria. In some studies, men progressed more rapidly than women. Using the regression of Cox in the present study, the magnitude of proteinuria was the only clinical parameter that independently predicted progressive renal impairment.\r"

  ".W": "This review describes the spectrum of clinical features observed in pediatric patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in different parts of the world. The typical clinical presentation consists of an episode of macroscopic hematuria within 24 to 48 hours of an upper respiratory infection. However, many children who present with macroscopic hematuria are subjected to a battery of urologic studies before the appropriate procedure is performed. This sequence highlights the lack of awareness of IgAN among pediatricians, family practitioners, and urologists. The finding of microscopic hematuria or, less commonly, proteinuria, in a urinalysis carried out as part of a school screening program is the most frequent \"presentation\" of IgAN in Japanese children. However, it is possible that many children with IgAN expressed as microscopic hematuria and/or mild proteinuria remain undiagnosed in this country because routine urinalysis is not done and many pediatric nephrologists are reluctant to perform renal biopsies when such children are identified. It is now recognized that some patients with IgAN and nephrotic range proteinuria exhibit a state of steroid responsiveness. The renal biopsy in such patients often reveals \"minimal change.\" Several recent studies have shown progressive deterioration in approximately 10% of all pediatric patients found to have IgAN and in 15% to 30% of the subset of patients with more severe histologic findings. Hypertension and proteinuria are observed frequently in patients who progress to chronic renal failure. It is proposed that multicenter collaborative studies be designed to evaluate proposed therapies for children with IgAN associated with proliferative glomerular lesions, particularly those in whom hypertension, proteinuria, and depressed glomerular filtration rate are found.\r"

The incidence of segmental and global proliferation, glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, and vessel sclerosis increased with levels of proteinuria (P less than 0.01 to 0.05). A comparison of the morphologic parameters in 30 patients with similar initial serum creatinine concentrations (less than or equal to 2 mg/dL) but different outcomes demonstrates a greater incidence and severity of pathologic features, especially glomerular sclerosis in the \"nonsurvival\" than \"survival\" groups. Vessel sclerosis as quantitatively measured by a \"point-count\" technique correlates with the extent of glomerular sclerosis (r = 0.5192; P less than 0.001), suggesting a causal relationship or common basis.\r"

We review the recent clinical and laboratory evidence that supports a genetic influence in the immunopathogenesis in some patients.

However, the lack of understanding the fundamental pathogenetic mechanisms hinders progress in the pursuit of genetically controlled process in this disease. Furthermore, the diagnosis requires a renal biopsy, and no therapy has been proven effective. Therefore, asymptomatic family members with IgAN may forego the invasive diagnostic procedure necessary to establish the diagnosis, and instances of familial disease may not be investigated. Nonetheless, the increasing awareness of families with multiple affected members offers an opportunity to investigate the hypothesized genetic influence in the pathogenesis of IgAN.\r"

This review compares and contrasts the clinical, pathologic, and experimental similarities and differences of these two disorders. Many patients with HSP have minimal extrarenal disease, while up to 30% of patients with IgAN will subsequently have systemic symptoms. Although patients with HSP are usually much younger than those with IgAN, the age distributions often overlap. Both may have recurrent macroscopic hematuria associated with pharyngitis, a similar risk of developing renal insufficiency, and recurrent disease after kidney transplantation. Although the pattern of IgA subclass and complement deposition are similar, monocytic and T lymphocytic infiltrates have been observed only in HSP. Dermal blood vessels of many patients with IgAN have IgA immunofluorescence similar to that in HSP, supporting a systemic process in IgAN. Although the pathogenesis is not clearly understood for either disease, investigations of potential disease mechanisms have revealed striking similarities. These include an up-regulated in vitro IgA immune response, circulating IgA-containing immune complexes and autoantibodies, and decreased Fc receptor-mediated immune clearance. Finally, immunogenetic studies suggest that patients with both conditions inherit a predisposition for disease.\r"

  ".W": "In humans, IgA is produced in quantities larger than those of all other immunoglobulin isotypes combined. In comparison with immunoglobulin of other isotypes, human IgA displays a unique heterogeneity of its molecular forms with a characteristic distribution in various body fluids. Serum IgA is represented by predominantly monomeric molecules of the IgA1 subclass and is produced mainly in the bone marrow, while in external secretions most of the IgA, produced locally in mucosal tissues, occurs in the polymeric configuration with a relatively increased proportion of IgA2 molecules. Cells that produce monomeric or polymeric IgA and IgA1 or IgA2 molecules are characteristically distributed in various lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. The differential interactions of monomeric and polymeric IgA molecules with various cells lead to their selective distribution in body fluids and to differences in the effector functions. Contrary to immunoglobulins of other isotypes, IgA participates in the disposal of antigens by mechanisms mostly devoid of inflammatory consequences. Various modes of immunization can induce an immune response in the systemic and/or secretory IgA compartments. Although most of the total serum IgA is momomeric, recent studies indicate that specific serum IgA antibodies induced by either mucosal or systemic immunizations with microbial antigens appear first in the polymeric form. Thus, cautious immunochemical analyses of IgA antibodies in systemic and secretory compartments with respect to their kinetics of appearance, monomeric and polymeric forms, and subclass may elucidate their tissue origin and character of the antigen involved in their induction.\r"

  ".W": "This report reviews the immunophysiology of the mucosal immune system, the principal antibody of which is a special form of IgA, termed secretory IgA. This IgA is produced locally by mucosal plasma cells that are descended from precursors initially stimulated in organized, mucosal lymphoid organs designed for antigen sampling. After the initial triggering, the precursor cells pass via regional lymph nodes, lymph, and blood to disseminate widely among mucosal sites. After secretion from a local plasma cell, IgA binds to an epithelial cell surface receptor and the complex passes through the epithelial cell into the secretions where it serves as a nonphlogistic immunologic barrier to inhibit uptake of antigens. The production of IgA is facilitated by particular regulatory T cells. At the same time, the synthesis of other classes of antibody, such as the phlogistic IgG, is dampened. This differential regulation of individual antibody classes after exposure to mucosal antigen plus the interrelatedness of the various mucous membranes of the body have important implications for host defense, pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including IgA nephropathy, and strategies of immunization.\r"

  ".W": "Two fundamentally different mechanisms may account for the glomerular immune deposits in IgA nephropathy (IgAN): (1) deposition of circulating immune complexes and (2) the in situ formation of immune complexes. In this review the experimental evidence for and against an important role of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in the pathogenesis of IgAN is summarized. Several physical characteristics, including size, lattice composition, and electrical charge, may influence the deposition of immune complexes in the renal mesangium. Furthermore, the likelihood of deposition of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in vulnerable locations (such as the kidney) may be increased because of their impaired removal from the circulation by macrophages of the liver and spleen and the erythrocyte-immune complex clearing mechanism. However, the relative contributions of these factors to the pathogenesis of IgAN remain speculative.\r"

  ".W": "Macromolecular IgA is found with a relatively high frequency in the sera of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). This macromolecular IgA consists of polymeric IgA, IgA-containing immune complexes, or both. The presence of polymeric IgA antibodies reflects a recent IgA response. Vaccination data in patients with IgAN suggest that these patients respond more vigorously with their mucosal immune system than do controls. The association of exacerbations with upper respiratory tract infections suggests that the immunogenic stimuli probably are of microbial origin and are presented to mucosal surfaces. Analysis by sucrose density ultracentrifugation has shown that the macromolecular IgA may contain IgG, IgA rheumatoid factor, and C3. The search for the antigen or antigens specifically responsible for IgAN has been unsuccessful. Although IgG and IgA rheumatoid factor may contribute, they do not account for the pathogenesis of the disease in all patients. Alternative mechanisms have to be assumed for patients who do not have detectable levels of IgA-containing immune complexes. They could have polymeric IgA or IgA-containing immune complexes intermittently, as has been shown in children with relapsing IgAN. The binding of circulating IgA antibodies to antigens present in the mesangium can lead to the local formation of deposits in the absence of circulating IgA complexes.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) can be considered high responders for IgA production; data which indicate a generalized hyperreactivity of the immune system include autoantibody production, increased response to viral vaccination, and high titers of antibodies to various common respiratory and gastrointestinal microbes. From clinical and experimental observations, two types of antigen seem to be most involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN, ie, environmental respiratory or gastrointestinal infectious agents and dietary antigens. A role played by microbes has been suggested because macroscopic hematuria shortly follows a pharyngitis or a gastrointestinal disturbance. Antibodies to a wide spectrum of viral and bacterial infectious agents have been detected in sera from patients with IgAN. The possible role of dietary antigens has been demonstrated experimentally in animal models. In human IgAN, antibodies to various dietary antigens have been detected in sera; antibodies have also been found in IgA immune complexes and renal eluates. In human IgAN, a significant decrease in serum levels of IgA-containing circulating immune complexes after a gluten-free diet has been observed. The present experience accounts for 27 IgAN patients followed for 6 months to 3 years on a gluten-free diet. A decrease in serum levels of IgA-containing circulating immune complexes was observed in 64% of the patients whose initial levels were high during a period of unrestricted diet. Patients with basal high levels also had significantly high levels of IgA antibodies to dietary antigens, including bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and various gluten fractions. After 1 year of gluten-free diet the levels significantly decreased. A disappearance of antigliadin IgA, observed in 80% of the cases, was paralleled by a decrease in titers of the other antibodies to dietary components. These data support the hypothesis that in patients with IgAN, gluten may act as a toxic lectin, increasing the permeability of the intestinal mucosa to various dietary antigens.\r"

Elevated levels of circulating immune complexes containing these components in significant numbers of patients have been found in several studies; IgAN is therefore assumed by many investigators to be an immune complex-mediated disease. Our studies have shown that IgG is often co-complexed with IgA within circulating immune complexes, and we have begun to examine the potential mechanisms for these observations. In this regard, elevated levels of IgA rheumatoid factor and of IgG anti-IgA antibodies were found in some patients. Nevertheless, we were unable to correlate levels of circulating immune complexes with any clinical index of disease. Furthermore, many individuals with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) also have elevated levels of circulating immune complexes containing IgG and IgA, IgA rheumatoid factor, and IgG anti-IgA antibodies, although these patients apparently do not have mesangial IgA deposits. Therefore, the role of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in the pathogenesis of IgAN requires further evaluation.\r"

These abnormalities include the decrease of IgA-specific suppressor T cell activity and the increase of IgA-specific helper T cell activity. A T cell subpopulation with receptors for the Fc portion of IgA and with CD4 antigens (ie, T alpha 4 cells) has been proposed as a candidate of IgA-specific switch T cells that convert IgM-producing B cells to IgA-producing B cells.

The in vitro complement-mediated solubilization of immune complexes containing IgG (bovine serum albumin [BSA]-anti-BSA) or IgA (DNP29-BSA-anti-DNP) was decreased, despite normal serum levels of complement. The close correlation between low values for complement-mediated solubilization and high serum levels of polymeric IgA and/or IgA rheumatoid factor indicates that these macromolecules interfere with the process. These findings suggest that polymeric IgA produced during stimulation of mucosae specifically interferes with immune complex solubilization. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms. The decreased complement-mediated solubilization in patients with IgAN could be responsible for persistently high levels of immune complexes containing IgA or IgG in the circulation and their continual deposition in the mesangium.\r"

This pattern of immunofluorescence staining for complement components suggests activation of the alternative and terminal pathways in most patients. Despite normal serum concentrations of C3 and other complement proteins, fragments generated by activation of C3, including iC3b, C3d, and iC3b-C3d neoantigen, and sometimes C4, are often detected in plasma. We found that the severity of the histologic changes in the renal biopsy specimens correlated with plasma iC3b-C3d neoantigen concentrations as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, no other clinical feature correlated with the plasma concentrations of this neoantigen.\r"

This communication sets forth the standard patterns of restriction fragments that are detected when normal human DNA cleaved with either HindIII or BglII is hybridized with seven contiguous segments comprising the entire 14-kb cDNA. Collectively, the more than 60 restriction fragments allow visualization of approximately 350 (HindIII) to 400 (BglII) kbp. This corresponds to the exon-containing one-fifth of the total genomic length of this gene, including the 3' untranslated region. Twelve two-allele restriction-site polymorphisms that span the entire length of the gene were detected with the cDNA probes and allele frequencies determined. A diagnostic approach is proposed that starts with deletion screening of DNA from male probands, includes carrier detection based on relative fragment intensities, and extends to RFLP detection using the same autoradiographs prepared for deletion screening. Our results on deletion analysis of 32 DMD/BMD families are presented in an accompanying paper.\r"

Twenty-one different single-intragenic deletions, and no duplications, were identified. The deletion endpoints were precisely mapped on the published HindIII fragment map. Detailed analysis of overlapping deletions led to clarification of the fragment order for some previously unsettled regions of the HindIII map and to the construction of a partial map of exon-containing BglII fragments. For the regions involved in deletions, the corresponding HindIII and BglIII fragments could be identified. Noncontiguous comigrating fragments were detected in two regions by careful analysis of the patterns in deletion patients. Four of the 21 deletions generated novel restriction fragments that facilitated detection of female carriers in these families. Twelve of the deletions had a breakpoint in one of the two large introns known to be the sites of breakpoint clusters. By combining deletions and RFLP analyses, we unequivocally identified the gamete that first carried the mutation in 13 families: eight oocytes and five sperm. Germ-line mosaicism previously detected in one male was confirmed by cDNA studies. In two additional families gonadal mosaicism was found in females. As evidence is accumulating for frequent mitotic origin of these deletion mutations, this phenomenon has to be considered when postulating mutational mechanisms and in genetic counseling of DMD/BMD families.\r"

We conducted this study to determine the prevalence of coronary risk-associated lipid abnormalities, and the relationship between lipid levels and exposure to corticosteroids and cyclosporine, in heart transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 92 consecutive heart transplant recipients from three different transplantation centers were reviewed. Patients from the three centers varied in age, in corticosteroid regimens, and in the proportion undergoing transplantation for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although 11 patients were not receiving corticosteroids at the time of the study, all patients had received them immediately after transplantation. In addition to information pertaining to demographics, pretransplant medical history, rejection episodes, drug doses, renal function, and blood glucose levels, data on dietary intake and body weight were collected and plasma lipid levels were measured at the time of record review. RESULTS: A significant number, 48 (52 percent), of heart transplant recipients were above the sex- and age-adjusted 75th percentile, and 35 (38 percent) were above the 90th percentile for total cholesterol in comparison with a general reference population. Similar elevations were found in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Bivariate analysis demonstrated cumulative prednisone exposure (r = 0.40, p = 0.0001) and cumulative cyclosporine exposure (r = 0.22, p = 0.04) but not diet or etiology of pretransplant heart disease to be significantly associated with age- or sex-adjusted total cholesterol percentiles. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol percentiles were also correlated with cumulative prednisone (r = 0.37, p = 0.001) and cumulative cyclosporine exposure (r = 0.24, p = 0.02). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, however, demonstrated cumulative prednisone exposure to be the strongest predictor of both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and percentiles (p = 0.0001), independent of cumulative cyclosporine exposure and other clinical variables. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that long-term corticosteroid exposure may result in an increased prevalence of unfavorable lipid profiles in heart transplant recipients.\r"

Our goal was to assess the effect of myocardial calcium content on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in uremic patients undergoing dialysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Energy subtraction radiography of the chest was used to measure myocardial calcium content in 43 patients undergoing dialysis, in 32 control subjects, and in nine patients with advanced cardiomyopathy. LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. The concentration of parathyroid hormone was measured by radioimmunoassay; calcium-phosphorus product, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bicarbonate were also assessed. RESULTS: Patients undergoing dialysis had a greater myocardial calcium content than control subjects [262 +/- 15.4 (mean +/- SE) versus 187 +/- 8 mg/cm2, p less than 0.05]. Ten patients with the highest myocardial calcium content (Group I) had the lowest LVEF values and highest left ventricular end-diastolic dimension. Significant inverse linear associations between LVEF and myocardial calcium content (r = -0.425, p = 0.013) and between parathyroid hormone concentration and LVEF (r = -0.352, p = 0.047) were noted. There was no association between parathyroid hormone concentration and myocardial calcium content. Stepwise regression analysis showed a strong positive correlation between myocardial calcium content and calcium-phosphorus product, vascular calcification, race (black), and parathyroidectomy. Similar analysis shows that LVEF was significantly associated with myocardial calcium content, lung calcium, calcium-phosphorus product, and race (black). CONCLUSION: We suggest that increased myocardial calcium content results from poor calcium and phosphorus control and may be enhanced by parathyroid hormone hyperactivity. Increased myocardial calcium content is strongly associated with myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing dialysis.\r"

  ".W": "Prevalence of \"higher than normal\" blood pressures in a community is inversely related to the magnitude of the elevation; the milder grades of elevation are far more prevalent. A multifactorially inherited tendency to develop hypertension is modulated by multiple environmental influences. Autonomic nervous and behavioral factors plausibly appear to contribute to the initiating mechanisms of hypertension; the associated hemodynamic changes and the resulting cardiovascular structural changes interact to perpetuate the process. The complex interaction of hypertension and atherosclerosis is further complicated by direct as well as secondary effects of antihypertensive drugs on atherogenesis. Attributable cardiovascular risk is generally proportional to the degree of hypertension across the entire range of elevated blood pressure; this kind of relationship holds also for normal versus subnormal blood pressure values. Pharmacologic lowering of blood pressure, however, does not confer proportional benefit. Thus, such lowering of blood pressure to normotensive levels does not reduce the risk level to that in the normotensive population. Therapeutic outcome is influenced by the interaction of blood pressure lowering, type of antihypertensive agents used, existing risk factors, and target organ damage. Benefits of lowering blood pressure in established mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure greater than 95 mm Hg) are confirmed. Drug treatment of patients with lower diastolic blood pressure or with isolated elevations of systolic blood pressures continues to be controversial as does the choice of initial therapeutic agent(s). The large-scale experience of clinical trials encompassing the long-term risks and benefits of the drug treatment of mild hypertension is limited to the use of diuretics and adrenergic beta blockers. A variety of new and promising therapeutic agents for use as alternate choices for initial therapy needs to undergo comparative evaluation.\r"

It was found that smoking was associated with increases in maternal heart rate and blood pressure, but there was no significant change in the uterine artery vascular resistance as measured by means of the systolic/diastolic velocity ratio. There also was an increase in the fetal heart rate as well as a highly significant rise in the systolic/diastolic velocity ratio of the umbilical artery. The responses suggest that smoking causes a direct increase in the vascular resistance of the placenta from the fetal side. This resistance may impair oxygen exchange across the placenta and contribute to the increased perinatal morbidity associated with smoking.\r"

  ".U": "89047598\r", 
  ".W": "In 88 pregnant women (7 to 40 weeks' gestation) we performed Doppler velocimetric studies of the uterine artery on its course through the parametrium by means of the newly developed, frontally radiating duplex sector scanner. This device enabled us to visually recognize the vessel and apply the more refined pulsed wave system. In 71 of 88 women, we were able to obtain measurements from both uterine arteries. We found significant differences in the maximum systolic to minimum diastolic frequency shift (A/B ratio) up to 4 between the right and left vessels in the first and second trimester. In the third trimester, the differences almost disappeared (mean +/- SD A/B ratio difference 0.4 +/- 0.3) in these uncomplicated pregnancies. We also report our mean values (first, second, and third trimesters) of the A/B ratio and the pulsatility index as an average from the right and left side measurements. Both values declined during the course of pregnancy (A/B ratio, 5.5, 2.9, and 2.1; pulsatility index, 2.5, 1.7, and 1.3). We conclude that, with some experience, this scanner has the advantage of visually recognizing the vessel under study and allows measurements in both main uterine arteries. The average of the right and left measurements provides a better summary of uterine perfusion. Due to the significant right/left difference in the A/B ratio, unilateral measurements of the uterine artery may give erroneous results during the first and second trimesters. Theoretically, the pulsed system provides a \"cleaner\" signal, but the values are comparable to those of devices that apply a continuous wave system.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether maternal oxygen administration affects fetal hemodynamics, we investigated 10 healthy fetuses and 10 growth-retarded fetuses near term by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The growth-retarded fetuses were characterized by abnormal blood flow velocity waveforms. Velocity waveforms were simultaneously recorded at 5-minute intervals from the fetal descending aorta and internal carotid artery before, during, and after maternal oxygen administered through a face mask that delivered 60% oxygen. The pulsatility index was calculated. During oxygen treatment growth-retarded fetuses showed significant temporary hemodynamic modifications as expressed by changes of pulsatility index values that increased in the internal carotid artery and decreased at the level of the descending aorta. On the other side no changes were found in healthy fetuses. These findings suggest that maternal oxygen administration can modify fetal hemodynamics in cases of growth retardation associated with abnormal blood flow velocity waveforms.\r"

Ultrasonic parameters included biparietal diameter, femur length, abdominal circumference, and head circumference. These values were compared with ultrasonic growth parameters in nonaddicted fetuses. Head and abdominal circumference data were used to evaluate the fetuses according to growth pattern. With this system of scoring, subtleties of asymmetric versus symmetric intrauterine growth retardation become apparent. In addition, birth weights of addicted infants were compared with birth weights of nonaddicted infants. The results suggest that, although statistically significant differences in birth weights cannot be demonstrated, abnormal growth of the addicted fetuses does occur. Addicted fetuses show a greater proportion of biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference values below the 50th and 25th percentiles than nonaddicted fetuses, and addicted fetuses more frequently exhibit intrauterine growth retardation patterns. These data suggest that it is fruitful to study these infants with near-normal size but with abnormal intrauterine growth patterns.\r"

The fetuses varied from 700 to 5800 gm and were consecutive singleton fetuses in vertex presentations delivered at a single institution. Overall 74% of the infants had birth weights within 10% of the ultrasonographic estimates and 42% had birth weights within 5% of the ultrasonographic estimates. The presence of oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios made no difference in the percent errors. The sensitivity for identifying a fetus with macrosomia (birth weight greater than 4000 gm) with an estimated weight of greater than or equal to 4000 gm was 65%. The specificity or percent of fetuses correctly identified ultrasonographically as not macrosomic was 90%. If fetuses predicted by ultrasonography to be greater than 3800 gm were included, the sensitivity for the prediction of macrosomia rises to 82% but the specificity would be 79%. There appears to be a fixed limitation to obtaining estimated fetal weights by ultrasonography, even in large series, because these data reaffirm the success and limitations of other methods used to estimate fetal weight previously reported in the literature.\r"

The sensitivities of serum iron (2.8%), transferrin saturation (12.5%), mean corpuscular volume (6.8%), and red cell distribution width (16.4%) were too low for screening or diagnosing iron depletion and deficiency. Serum ferritin level should be used to screen for and diagnose iron depletion and deficiency in pregnancy.\r"

Overall, 56 (10.8%) women were culture positive for C. trachomatis. Restricting testing to women with risk factors for infection or who had cervical leukocytosis on Gram staining of cervical mucus, or who were seropositive for C. trachomatis antibodies proved impractical because of insensitivity or nonspecificity. We evaluated three chlamydia diagnostic tests to determine which test had the best performance characteristics. In comparison with culture, the direct fluorescent antigen test had a sensitivity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 78%, whereas the enzyme immunoassay had 96% and 69%, respectively. When analysis was redone with any two positive laboratory tests to define true infection status, the performance parameters of enzyme immunoassay were sensitivity 98%, specificity 98%, and positive predictive value 87%. We conclude that all women undergoing therapeutic abortion require testing for C. trachomatis infection and that enzyme immunoassay is the most effective and practical test in this group of women.\r"

In this study the efficacy of the fetal-pelvic index was evaluated in 46 patients with abnormal labor patterns that required labor augmentations and was compared with that of two other means (Colcher-Sussman x-ray pelvimetry and ultrasonographically derived estimated fetal weight greater than or equal to 4000 gm). Of the 24 women who required operative intervention (19 cesarean sections and five operative vaginal procedures), 17 had positive fetal-pelvic index values (sensitivity = 0.71). Six of the seven fetuses of patients with false-negative fetal-pelvic index values persisted in an occipitoposterior presentation, and these patients failed to progress in labor. Of the 22 patients in whom vaginal deliveries were spontaneous, 21 had negative fetal-pelvic index values (specificity = 0.95). Of the 18 women with positive fetal-pelvic index values, 17 required operative intervention (positive predictability = 0.94). In contrast, when used alone, neither x-ray pelvimetry nor ultrasonographically derived estimated fetal weight greater than or equal to 4000 gm provided accurate identification of fetal-pelvic disproportion.\r"
