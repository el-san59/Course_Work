  ".U": "89055827\r", 
  ".W": "The tumor promoter receptor protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated as a key enzyme in cellular growth regulation. It is, therefore, believed that specific PKC inhibitors may include effective antiproliferative agents. Previously, we have shown that the antiestrogen tamoxifen and related triphenylethylenes are potent inhibitors of PKC. Although the mechanism of inhibition of PKC by triphenylethylenes clearly involves nonspecific interactions between the antiestrogens and the lipid cofactor of PKC, we recently demonstrated that PKC itself has specific triphenylethylene-binding sites, suggesting that the inhibitory mechanism also involves specific drug-protein interactions. In this report, we characterize the direct interactions between PKC and triphenylethylenes and demonstrate their relevance to the inhibitory action of triphenylethylenes against PKC. We show (a) that the triphenylethylene-binding sites of PKC are located in the catalytic domain of the enzyme, (b) that MgATP (i.e., 10 mM MgCl2 plus 1 mM ATP) competes with the triphenylethylenes for binding sites on PKC, and (c) that triphenylethylenes are competitive inhibitors of PKC with respect to MgATP. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that triphenylethylenes can inhibit PKC by binding directly to the ATP-binding region of the active site of the enzyme. The specific interactions between triphenylethylenes and PKC characterized here may provide a rationale for developing more specific PKC inhibitors.\r"

Cardiac operations induce a greater decrease in immunologic response than other surgical operations. On the other hand, identification of functional lymphocyte subclasses by means of appropriate monoclonal antibodies appears to provide an accurate measurement of cellular immune competence. Employing these methods, we found a significant decrease of T helper cell/T cytotoxic-suppressor cell ratio in the periperal blood of 20 patients undergoing cardiac operations. This decrease during the period of anesthesia (before surgical incision) is due as much to a decrease of T helper cell percentage as to an increase of T cytotoxic cell percentage. However, during the surgical trauma period (surgical incision to the end of the operation) it is due to a greater increase of T cytotoxic-suppressor cell percentage without significant changes in the percentage of T helper cells.\r"

Pentamidine, 50 mg or 300 mg, mixed with technetium-99m-labelled human serum albumin in a total volume of 3 ml, was administered by way of three jet nebulisers (System 22', 'System 22 Mizer', and 'Respigard II') operated with a gas flow of 6 l/min, and one ultrasound nebuliser ('Pulmosonic'). Pulmonary and non-pulmonary isotope deposition was measured for each apparatus and adverse effects and lung function tests were recorded. For both doses of pentamidine, the system 22 mizer produced the largest pulmonary isotope deposition and it was completed in the shortest time. Oropharyngeal and gastric deposition were least with the respigard II, which also caused the fewest adverse effects. The adverse effects were greatest with the system 22 mizer and pulmosonic and the higher pentamidine dose, which also caused significant reductions in measurements of pulmonary function. It is concluded that either the system 22 mizer or the respigard II should be used to administer nebulised pentamidine.\r"

The activity and toxicity of oral AZT, 200 mg 4-hourly when possible, was evaluated in 365 consecutive patients with ARC (80) or AIDS (285) followed up for a mean of 31 weeks (range 2-52). A transient increase in body weight, Karnofsky index, and CD4 cell count was observed during the first months of therapy. However, by 6 months, these values had returned to their pretreatment levels and several opportunistic infections, malignancies, and deaths occurred. These disappointing results were partly related to the haematological toxicity of the drug, which led to interruption of treatment in many patients. Thus the benefits of AZT are limited to a few months for ARC and AIDS patients. At least for the most severely affected patients, reduced dosage of AZT may increase the therapeutic index.\r"

Initial data reduction accomplished with principle component analysis identified three factors with eigenvalues greater than one. Orthogonal rotation of the preliminary solution demonstrated that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), percent body fat (%BF) and VO2max, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) could be used to represent Factors 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The subsequent MANOVA using these variables proved significant. Post hoc analysis via simultaneous confidence intervals indicated that LDL-C group differences were not significant. Values for %BF and HCL-C in the ST group (14.0% and 1.17 mmol.l-1, respectively) were between but did not differ significantly from respective values in the ET (11.8% and 1.34 mmol.l-1) and SED (18.7% and 1.13 mmol.l-1) groups. However, %BF and HDL-C differences between the ET and SED groups were significant. The VO2max of the ET subjects (63.2 ml.kg-1.min-1) was significantly higher than that of either the ST or SED subjects (49.5 and 46.7 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively). These results suggest that ET is the most effective modality of exercise for CAD risk reduction while benefits derived from ST are minimal.\r"

The A PARAs (average VO2 peak during arm cranking 2.24 l.min-1) demonstrated a significantly higher maximal cardiorespiratory fitness compared to I subjects (average VO2 peak 1.56 l.min-1). During graded arm exertion, at exercise intensities approximating 45%, 57%, and 70% of VO2 peak, the active subjects developed cardiac outputs (assessed via CO2-rebreathing) ranging from 9.07 to 11.21 l.min-1; a 34-44% advantage relative to their inactive counterparts (6.30-8.36 l.min-1). Similarly, exercise stroke volumes for A (76-80 ml) were 38-45% higher than for I paraplegics (55-56 ml). Although both groups demonstrated a distinctive circulatory hypokinesis during arm cranking, the immediate pattern of cardiovascular response was dissimilar for the highly active versus inactive subjects. The former demonstrated a predominantly \"central\" adaptation to steady-state arm exercise (exhibiting normal stroke volumes and arteriovenous O2 extractions for spinal cord-injured subjects), while the latter displayed markedly reduced stroke volumes concomitant with abnormally large peripheral arteriovenous oxygen extractions for a given oxygen uptake.\r"

  ".W": "The thymus is important in the differentiation of bone marrow-derived precursor cells into functional T cells; humoral factors, as well as physical interactions with nurse cells, dendritic cells and epithelial cells, are thought to be instrumental in this process. Thymic lymphocytes mature during their migration from the cortical to the medullary region of the thymus, when they undergo phenotypic changes that include the acquisitions of T-cell antigen receptors, hormone receptors and differentiation antigens. Cortical T cells are thus mostly CD4+CD8+, whereas medullary T cells are either CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+. During this period T cells are subjected to two types of repertoire selection: all T cells recognizing self-MHC with low affinity may be preferentially amplified (positive selection), and in a second step T cells with high-affinity receptors for self-MHC determinants plus self antigens are eliminated (negative selection). We have described two monoclonal antibodies specific for the V beta 6 gene segment of the alpha/beta heterodimeric T-cell antigen receptor and have shown that most CD4+/V beta 6+ T cell recognize the Mlsa antigenic determinant but not Mlsb; similar results have been reported for V beta 8.1 and Mlsa. In both situations, tolerance to Mlsa correlated in an MHC-dependent fashion with absence of V beta 6 or V beta 8.1 T-cell antigen receptor expressing T cells in the periphery. We show here by immunostaining of thymus cryosections and cytofluorometric analysis that V beta 6-expressing cortical T cells are present at high density in both Mlsa and Mlsb mice, but do not enter the medullary region of Mlsa animals.\r"

Whereas the former characteristic (referred to as negative selection or tolerance) is associated with intrathymic deletion of T cells expressing T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain variable (V beta) domains, which confer a preferential reactivity to self antigens, the existence of the latter (referred to as positive selection or MHC restriction) has so far only been inferred indirectly from functional studies. We show here that intrathymic deletion of V+beta 6 T cells (reactive with a self-antigen encoded by the Mlsa locus) is controlled by polymorphic MHC class II determinants. Furthermore, in mice lacking expression of Mlsa, the same class II MHC loci control the frequency of occurrence of V+beta 6 cells among mature CD4+ T lymphocytes. These data are direct evidence for positive selection by MHC determinants in the thymus in unmanipulated animals.\r"

A number of studies, however, have revealed responses of considerable magnitude involving both CD8+ and CD4+ CTLs with class II restriction, suggesting that class II-restricted CTLs recognizing exogeneous protein antigens may exist. As class II antigens are normally expressed on limited types of cells such as B cells and macrophages, such CTLs might be expected to exert a suppressive effect on antibody responses. Here we report that stimulation of mouse lymphocytes with a soluble antigen induced CD8+ and CD4+ CTLs specific for the antigen with class II restriction. The specific lysis was far more efficient when target B cells specifically recognized the antigen than when they did not, indicating that the primary targets for these CTLs are probably B cells expressing immunoglobulin receptors reactive for the same antigen molecule. These results suggest that the natural occurrence of such CTLs during immune responses may explain antigen-specific suppression on antibody responses by T cells.\r"

We analyzed the globin programs of B6SUtA cells undergoing erythroid differentiation in both suspension and clonal cultures. In the absence of added erythropoietin, a small number of hemoglobinized cells were present, and these expressed predominantly embryonic globin. Addition of erythropoietin increased the number and maturation of hemoglobinized cells and led to a preferential augmentation of adult globin. Analysis of individual B6SUtA erythroid bursts showed that embryonic and adult globin can be expressed in cells derived from a single progenitor. Furthermore, by studying globin expression in cultured cells from mouse embryos, we found that the globin programs of B6SUtA cells are similar to those of erythroid progenitors at the period of transition from yolk sac to fetal liver erythropoiesis. Since B6SUtA cells are derived from adult bone marrow and they have the capacity to express embryonic globin, we speculate that the globin locus is not irreversibly modified during development and that adult cells at early stages of erythroid differentiation can transiently express ontogenetically primitive globin programs.\r"

Approximately 500 T-cell hybridomas were generated from each of three strains of MHC congenic mice [B10 (H-2b), B10.BR (H-2k), and B10.Q (H-2q)] by fusing mitogen-stimulated lymph node T cells with the thymoma BW5147. RNA was prepared from 1629 individual hybridomas and analyzed for the expression of 10 V alpha and 16 V beta gene families. These experiments reveal significant differences in the relative contributions of 1 V alpha gene family (V alpha 3) and several V beta gene segments (V beta 5.1, -5.2, -11, and -12) to the T-cell receptor repertoire of MHC disparate mice.\r"

Those with HLA-A2 recognized autologous or HLA-A2-matched B-lymphoblastoid cells in the presence of synthetic peptide representing residues 55-73 or 56-68 of the virus matrix protein sequence. Influenza A virus-specific CTL from donors without HLA-A2 or with an HLA-A2 variant type failed to respond to this peptide. CTL lines specific for HLA-A2 plus peptide did not lyse peptide-treated target cells from HLA-A2 variant donors. They also failed to lyse peptide-treated cells with point mutations that had been inserted into HLA-A2 at positions 62-63, 66, 152, and 156 and, in some instances, mutations at positions 9 and 70. CTL lysed peptide-treated target cells with mutations in HLA-A2 at positions 43, 74, and 107. The results imply that this defined peptide epitope therefore interacts with HLA-A2 in the binding groove so that the long alpha-helices of HLA-A2 make important contact with the peptide at positions 66, 152, and 156. Different amino acids at position 9, which is in the floor of the peptide binding groove of HLA-A2 and the closely related position 70, modulate the peptide interaction so that some T-cell clones react and some do not.\r"

The CD3-selected Ts hybridomas showed a 1-2 logarithmic enrichment in suppressor activity when compared to the parent lines; they also specifically bound NP-coupled sheep red blood cells in rosette assays. This antigen-binding ability could be down-modulated by anti-CD3 antibody. Similarly, surface expression of CD3 was specifically down-modulated by preincubation of these hybridomas with antigen. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody under reducing conditions coprecipitated a broad band of 38-50 kDa associated with two CD3 (25 and 16 kDa) bands. T-cell receptor, anti-alpha-specific monoclonal antibody also immunoprecipitated a broad band in the 41 to 49-kDa region. The combined results suggest that, like helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, Ts cells also bear antigen-specific receptors associated with CD3 molecules.\r"

In the presence of IgE, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 15 of the 26 patients formed a detectable amount of IgE-binding factors, whereas those of normal individuals of allergic rhinitis patients failed to do so. The major source of IgE-binding factors was the T cells of the HIV-1-infected patients. The CD8+ T cells from a HIV-1-infected patient formed IgE-binding factors upon incubation with IgE, and type II receptors for Fc epsilon were detected on both CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in one of five patients studied. It was also found that culture supernatants of mononuclear cells from HIV-1-infected patients released soluble factors that induce normal human T cells to form IgE-binding factors. The results suggest that lymphocytes of some HIV-1-infected patients are activated to produce lymphokines regulating formation of IgE-binding factors.\r"

  ".W": "Recent data suggest that aminosugar derivatives which inhibit glycoprotein processing have potential anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. These inhibitory effects may be due to disruption of cell fusion and subsequent cell-cell transmission of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus. Free virus particles able to bind CD4-positive cells are still produced in the presence of these compounds with only partial reduction of infectivity. We now report a method to score in parallel both the degree of antiviral activity and the effect on cell division of aminosugar derivatives. We find that (i) the compounds 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-L-arabinitol and N-(5-carboxymethyl-1-pentyl)-1,5-imino-L-fucitol partially inhibit the cytopathic effect (giant cell formation, etc.) of HIV and yield of infectious virus; (ii) the compounds N-methyldeoxynojirimycin and N-ethyldeoxynojirimycin reduce the yield of infectious HIV by an order of four and three logarithms, respectively; and (iii) one compound, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, of the 47 compounds previously screened reduces infectious viral particles by a logarithmic order greater than five at noncytotoxic concentrations. In addition, long-term growth of infected cells in the presence of N-butyldeoxynojirimycin gradually decreases the proportion of infected cells, leading to eventual elimination of HIV from culture. This result suggests that replication is associated with cytolysis. The ability to break the cycle of replication and reinfection has important implications in the chemotherapy of AIDS.\r"

  ".U": "89057913\r", 
  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the retrovirus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), contains two heavily glycosylated envelope proteins, gp120 and gp41, which mediate attachment of virions to glycosylated cell surface receptor molecules (CD4 antigens) and appear to be responsible for syncytium formation and associated cytopathic effects of this virus. A comprehensive study of the effects of N-linked glycoprotein processing inhibitors on HIV-1 replication, infectivity, cytopathicity, target-cell infectibility, syncytium formation, and gp120 electrophoretic mobility was conducted to assess the importance of protein glycosylation in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 in vitro. The electrophoretic mobility of gp120 was decreased when gp120 was synthesized in the presence of castanospermine or 1-deoxynojirimycin (inhibitors of glucosidase I), increased when gp120 was synthesized in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin (mannosidase I) or swainsonine (mannosidase II), and unaffected when gp120 was synthesized in the presence of bromoconduritol (glucosidase II). Inhibition by tunicamycin (lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor synthesis), castanospermine, 1-deoxynojirimycin, and 1-deoxymannojirimycin attenuated HIV-1 infectivity and blocked HIV-1-induced syncytium formation and cytopathicity, whereas bromoconduritol and swainsonine failed to have such effects. None of the inhibitors interfered with virus replication in acutely infected cells or affected the ability of target cells to form syncytia with untreated HIV-1-infected cells. These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation is critical to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 at the levels of viral infectivity and cytopathicity but not at the level of virus replication or of host-cell infectibility.\r"

Codons for two amino acid residues (Ser-Arg) were inserted at selected positions within the region encoding the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4. A vaccinia virus-based expression system was used to produce soluble full-length extracellular CD4 fragments containing the insertions. The mutant proteins were tested for direct binding to soluble gp120 (the CD4-binding subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein) and to a series of HIV-blocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. Impaired gp120 binding activity resulted from insertions after amino acid residues 31, 44, 48, 52, 55, and 57 in the first immunoglobulin-like domain. The epitopes for two HIV-blocking monoclonal antibodies, OKT4A and OKT4D, were also mapped in the gp120-binding region in the first domain. Insertions after amino acid residues 21 and 91 in the first domain had no effect on gp120 binding but impaired the binding of OKT4E, suggesting that this antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope not directly involved in gp120 binding. Moderate impairment of gp120 binding resulted from the insertion after amino acid residues 164 in the second immunoglobulin-like domain, where the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies MT151 and OKT4B were also mapped.\r"

Cryopreserved LAK cells retained 58.8 to 87.4 percent of cytotoxicity, as compared with that in fresh control cells. Cryopreserved NK cell activity against K562 and Molt-4 targets was 45.7 to 67.9 percent of the respective values of the fresh control cells. The responsiveness of NK cells to polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (poly I:C), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), or rIL-2 remained intact. Activated NK cell activity after poly I:C or IFN-alpha stimulation and that after rIL-2 were, respectively, comparable to and higher than the endogenous NK cell activity of the fresh cells. The composition of lymphocyte subsets as determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies did not change after cryopreservation, indicating that cellular loss of the given subsets did not occur during the procedure. The retention of substantial levels of cytotoxicity in cryopreserved LAK and NK cells may make them promising candidates as cytotoxic effector cells.\r"

These children had remained asymptomatic in the follow-up period after the acute inflammatory stage of Kawasaki disease. Persistent and transient thallium defects were present in one child with acute posterolateral myocardial infarction; obstruction of two coronary vessels supplying the defect zones was confirmed by contrast angiography. After 8 months of treatment a follow-up nuclear scan showed marked reduction in the size of the defect and almost complete abolishment of the ischemic reaction. Thus tomographic thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy in conjunction with vasodilation stress is useful to assess myocardial perfusion in children with Kawasaki disease and demonstrates marked improvement in regional perfusion after adequate medical therapy.\r"

Using genomic DNA from more than 200 individuals, we have carried out a population study with a cDNA probe for the DR beta chain, which, under appropriate conditions, does not cross-hybridize with genes from other HLA-D subregions (e.g., DP and DQ). We first assessed the correspondence between serologically defined HLA-DR types and DNA patterns obtained after digestion with TaqI and found that DNA patterns allowed us to identify most specificities. Only two pairs of antigens are not distinguishable: with the DR beta probe alone we cannot distinguish DR3 from DRw6 or DR7 from DRw9. However, the correct assignment can always be made for the first pair by hybridizing the same digests with a DQ alpha or DQ beta probe. Thus DR typing from the DNA patterns is practical and accurate. We also looked for serologically undetectable subtypes. RFLPs revealed high-frequency subtypes for the specificities DR 2, 3, 5, w6, 7, and w9. Some of these are more accurately viewed as variant haplotypes, since the relevant variation is probably not at the DR beta locus that determines the serological specificities but rather at other closely linked and highly homologous DR beta loci such as DR beta-III. Nevertheless, the existence of variant haplotypes for so many specificities indicates a wealth of polymorphic variation beyond that detected serologically and provides more specific markers for studies of various diseases associated with HLA-DR specificities.\r"

Certain clinical characteristics have been reported to increase the likelihood of its detection in referral patients, but the usefulness of these clinical characteristics has not been evaluated in an open population. In our study, we undertook to evaluate the value of the clinical history as a screening test for inflammatory back disease in a general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three male patients with back pain of moderate duration and with clinical characteristics suggestive of inflammatory back disease were recruited by advertising and were studied by various means, including computed tomography (CT), scintigraphy, and radiography. RESULTS: One patient had radiographic sacroiliitis. Two had positive results for the B27 antigen, and another had positive results for the cross-reacting HLA antigen B7. Eight patients had abnormal scintiscans of the sacroiliac joints. Twenty-one of 23 patients and 20 of 23 control subjects had abnormalities that were detected by CT. Repeat plain radiographs of the pelvis done 36 months after enrollment into the study did not uncover further evidence of sacroiliitis. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate plain radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis will often not develop in patients with historical features suggestive of inflammatory back disease even with long-term evaluation, thus vitiating the specificity of these historical findings in men with back pain of relatively brief duration.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the prolonged bleeding times and clinical bleeding in chronic renal failure. Recent evidence has implicated an abnormality in the structure or function of the von Willebrand factor or in its interaction with uremic platelets. We investigated this factor in 11 patients with chronic renal failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples for cell counts, chemistries, and coagulation studies were obtained from 11 patients with chronic renal failure and prolonged bleeding times. Concentrations of von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity were determined in plasma and platelets. Multimeric analysis of von Willebrand factor in plasma and platelets was conducted. In eight cases, the platelets of uremic patients were purified, and the thrombin- and ristocetin-induced binding of normal von Willebrand factor to these platelets was examined. RESULTS: The mean plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and activity (ristocetin cofactor assay) were elevated 2.77 mu/ml and 1.88 mu/ml, respectively (normal, 1.01 mu/ml and 1.07 mu/ml, respectively). The ratio of activity to antigen in uremic plasma was 0.67 (normal, 1.05). The mean platelet von Willebrand factor antigen and activity in the uremic patients was decreased (0.26 and 0.50 mu/10(9) platelets, respectively) compared with normal patients (0.46 and 0.93 mu/10(9) platelets, respectively). The oligomeric structure of the uremic plasma von Willebrand factor lacked the largest multimers. Collection of the blood for analysis in several protease inhibitors and/or EDTA did not change the multimeric structure. The von Willebrand factor multimeric structure of platelets from uremic patients was normal. The ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation of the uremic platelet-rich plasma was decreased compared with normal plasma samples. Thrombin and ristocetin-induced binding of normal von Willebrand factor to uremic patients' platelets was indistinguishable from the binding to normal platelets. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the uremic platelet-binding sites for von Willebrand factor are intact and that the defect in ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation is most likely plasmatic in nature. At least one plasmatic defect was the observed reduction or absence of the largest plasma von Willebrand factor multimer in uremic patients. The platelet von Willebrand content was significantly decreased. These defects may play a role in the prolonged bleeding time and the clinical bleeding observed in patients with uremia.\r"

Exudative scars resulted from the natural course of sub-retinal new vessels, and dry scars from successful photocoagulation to the new vessels. Low-vision aids consisted of high-power positive lenses. Eyes were divided into three groups according to their distance visual acuity before using low-vision aids: Group 1, 20/100; Group 2, 20/200 to 20/300; and Group 3, 20/400 or poorer. The print size resolution on the Rosenbaum pocket vision screener and power of the low-vision aid in each group were compared for the eyes having exudative scars and those with dry photocoagulation scars. In Groups 2 and 3, eyes with dry macular scars reached a similar resolution of print size but with significantly (P less than .01) lower-power visual aids than eyes with exudative macular scars. In Group 1, eyes with dry macular scars achieved a better print size resolution using significantly (P less than .01) lower-power visual aids than eyes with exudative scars.\r"

The life pattern and attitudes toward supernatural beings and the commonly shared folk belief of evil-induced genital retraction were considered grounds for the panic, while the community's anxious reaction and hysterical atmosphere facilitated the intensification and recurrence of the episodes. Geographic seclusion associated with localism in folk beliefs and practices may have kept the epidemics confined to the region.\r"

All patients received 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol as an intravenous bolus injection for the induction of anesthesia. Whole blood propofol concentrations were measured at intervals up to 12 h, using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Propofol protein binding was estimated by equilibrium dialysis 10 min after injection of propofol. Individual propofol profiles for all patients were best described by a three-compartment open mammillary model. Rapid and slow propofol distribution half-times were observed, followed by an elimination phase with a half-time of 4-5 h. Propofol total body clearance was reduced (1.99 +/- 0.68 l.min-1) in the patients with cirrhosis but did not differ significantly from that in the control patients (2.30 +/- 0.61 l.min-1). The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was similar in the two groups. No significant difference in elimination half-life was observed between the two groups. Propofol was extensively bound (mean: 97-98%) to the plasma protein of both cirrhotic and control groups. This study shows that propofol pharmacokinetics and protein binding of propofol following a single intravenous bolus dose were not markedly affected by uncomplicated cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the ability of human alveolar macrophages to produce interleukin-1-beta (IL1-beta), we examined IL1-beta mRNA accumulation in autologous monocytes and alveolar macrophages from normal volunteers. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide stimulation of monocytes induced rapid IL1-beta mRNA accumulation, reaching a maximum at 2 to 4 h and declining thereafter. Alveolar macrophages, however, accumulated much less mRNA than did monocytes. This difference could not be explained by differences in kinetics of IL1-beta gene expression between the 2 cell types, isolation techniques, or alveolar macrophage lidocaine exposure. This suggests that differences in transcription of the IL1-beta gene exist between these 2 cell types. Aging is a possible factor important in some functional differences between these 2 cell types. To determine if this difference in the capacity to express the IL1-beta gene might be a function of cell maturity, monocytes were aged in vitro for 7 days. After this culture period, monocytes had a marked decrease in the ability to accumulate IL1-beta mRNA, suggesting that cell aging may be one mechanism involved in producing these transcriptional differences. Because IL1-beta has also been implicated in the inflammatory and fibrotic responses in pulmonary sarcoidosis, 4 patients with newly diagnosed sarcoidosis underwent bronchoalveolar lavage, and IL1-beta mRNA accumulation was compared in their alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes. Comparing normal alveolar macrophages to those from patients with sarcoidosis showed no differences in the kinetics of IL1-beta mRNA expression or in the LPS-induced levels of IL1-beta mRNA accumulation. In addition, augmented levels of IL1-beta transcript were not noted in unstimulated sarcoid alveolar macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to draw conclusions concerning the characteristics of a referral population of 124 patients with alpha 1AT deficiency and symptomatic emphysema. Typically, the alpha 1AT level was 30 mg/dl, and the alpha 1AT phenotype was almost always PiZZ. The individuals in this population were most often male, caucasian, and ex-smokers, and they had become dyspneic between 25 and 40 yr of age. Most routine blood tests were normal. The chest radiographs and ventilation-perfusion studies typically showed abnormalities with a lower zone distribution, and about one third of the study population had evidence suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Lung function tests were typical for emphysema; the FEV1 and DLCO were the parameters most dramatically reduced, and the annual rate of decline of those parameters was greater than that of the general population. The cumulative probability of survival of this population indicated a significantly shortened lifespan with a mean survival of 16% at 60 yr of age compared with 85% for normal persons.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive studies have been conducted to determine the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by investigating the role of complement, a mediator of inflammation. Complement activation products have been detected in blood samples from patients during ARDS. However, the individual complement components that have been assessed only indicated generalized inflammation, and none could unequivocally discriminate the onset of this acute inflammatory lung injury. In this two-year prospective study of 87 septic patients, 22 of whom developed ARDS (25%), we determined complement activation by quantifying the terminal complement complex (TCC), C5b-9. The TCC is a stable complement by-product formed following activation of either the classical or alternative pathways. Our results show that plasma TCC concentrations increased an average of 110% (p = 0.002) two days prior to the onset of ARDS and also transiently increased an average of 45% (p = 0.01) immediately preceding its resolution. Furthermore, plasma TCC concentrations were a more sensitive measure of this acute inflammatory lung injury than levels of C3a desarginine, C4a desarginine, C5a desarginine, and total hemolytic complement activity. We conclude that a temporal association exists between accentuated formation of plasma TCC and the development and also resolution of septic ARDS. Therefore, we suggest that researchers include plasma TCC concentrations in clinical studies when they could use a potential early indicator for ARDS.\r"

Therefore, we evaluated PVP by measuring the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER) for transferrin with positron emission tomography (PET) in 15 ARDS patients, including 5 patients studied within 4 days of onset and 13 patients studied at least 7 days after onset. In 3 patients, studies were performed at both early and late stages. These results were compared to 12 non-smoking adult volunteers. Regional PTCER and extravascular lung density (EVD) were determined from a 1-h PET scan after intravenous injection of gallium-68 citrate, which binds rapidly to native transferrin. Oxygenation, radiologic score, as well as outcome were recorded for each patient. Mean PTCER was highest during the early phase of ARDS (560 +/- 275 x 10(-4) min-1) although PTCER in the late ARDS patients was also significantly higher than in normals (319 +/- 187 vs 58 +/- 33 x 10(-4) min-1; p less than .01). EVD was similar in both early and late ARDS groups (.39 +/- .08 and .37 +/- .13 g/ml lung, respectively) and markedly higher than in normals (.22 +/- .05 g/ml lung, p less than 0.01). PTCER decreased in each of the 3 serial studies. The correlation between PTCER and EVD was poor, as were correlations for either PTCER or EVD versus changes in oxygenation, radiologic score, survival, or duration of ventilator dependency. In the late ARDS patients, PTCER was usually elevated even if EVD had returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mice were injected with 40 micrograms VCO subcutaneously, either prophylactically or therapeutically. IL-2 (Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ) was administered at a dose of 25,000 units intraperitoneally twice daily for three consecutive days, prophylactically, therapeutically immediately after tumor challenge (early), or 9 days after tumor challenge (late). Mice were followed for 50 days after tumor challenge, and mortalities were recorded. Mice receiving VCO alone did not demonstrate better survival than controls. However, mice receiving VCO with IL-2 immunomodulation demonstrated consistently better survival than mice treated with IL-2 alone or controls. The group receiving VCO therapy with late IL-2 modulation (75% survival demonstrated improved survival over controls (0% survival, P less than 0.00001), VCO-treated mice (0% survival, P less than 0.005), and IL-2-treated mice (29% survival, P = 0.07). In vitro assays revealed enhanced NK activity and suggested cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) induction as possible mechanisms responsible for these biologic effects. Combined VCO and IL-2 immunotherapy may be of potential benefit to patients with metastatic colon cancer, but further research is required to optimize treatment regimens.\r"

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Referal-based inpatient oncology service at a university medical center. PATIENTS: A sequential sample of 13 patients with metastatic colon carcinoma, malignant melanoma, or hypernephroma who were receiving treatment with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells in the maximally tolerated doses. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Pretreatment variables of mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac index were compared with the same variables measured either immediately before the eighth dose of interleukin-2 or immediately before the initiation of pressor support with dopamine hydrochloride. When these values were compared with the pretreatment values, patients showed a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (92 mm Hg compared with 75 mm Hg; P less than 0.0001), and systemic vascular resistance (15.1 compared with 8.5 mm Hg/L . min; P less than 0.0001), but an increase in heart rate (73 compared with 110 beats/min; P less than 0.0001) and cardiac index (3.1 compared with 4.7 L/min . m2 body surface area; P less than 0.0001). No significant change was noted in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Low systemic vascular resistance persisted throughout interleukin-2 therapy. Although blood pressure normalized in 24 hours, the systemic vascular resistance remained below baseline levels 6 days after interluekin therapy had been stopped. INTERVENTIONS: Blood pressure was successfully supported at greater than 90 mm Hg with dopamine hydrochloride or phenylephrine hydrochloride, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with high doses of interleukin-2 induces hemodynamic changes consistent with a high-output and low-resistance state similar to changes noted during the early phase of septic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Use of cefoperazone in a patient with Aeromonas caviae in the respiratory tract selected a mutant that constitutively produced beta-lactamase. This mutant, in contrast to its parental strain with an inducible beta-lactamase, showed enhanced resistance to newer cephalosporins and aztreonam. This observation suggested that species of Aeromonas, like those of other genera with inducible beta-lactamases, may pose therapeutic problems associated with the rapid development of multiple beta-lactam resistance. Thus, a study was designed to identify the beta-lactamases in 12 strains representing four species of Aeromonas and assess their role in drug resistance. Eleven strains possessed inducible beta-lactamases. One strain showed no detectable activity. An analysis of substrate and inhibitor profiles, isoelectric points, and beta-lactam susceptibility patterns revealed the presence of at least four distinguishable inducible beta-lactamases. These enzymes were involved in the resistance of strains within the genus to penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and imipenem but not cefoxitin. Unlike most other organisms with inducible beta-lactamases, all four strains of A. caviae, one of four strains of A. sobria, and one of three strains of A. hydrophila possessed two distinct inducible beta-lactamases. Furthermore, substrate and inhibitor profiles revealed that many of these Aeromonas beta-lactamases were distinct from inducible enzymes that have been characterized in other genera of gram-negative bacteria.\r"

We attempted to determine whether migration is a dynamic process such that the organisms move to avoid exposure to toxic antimicrobial agents. With the use of axenic cultures of T. vaginalis that were radiolabeled and assayed for chemotaxis in plastic multiwelled plates with a membrane filter inserted to trap organisms, the response of clinical isolates to various antimicrobial agents was studied. Chemotaxis was readily demonstrable and dependent upon factors including time of incubation, media used, and viscosity of media. Nitroimidazoles (e.g., metronidazole) which readily inhibited the growth of these organisms also caused significant chemorepulsion after minutes of exposure. The antifungal imidazoles ketoconazole and miconazole inhibited growth nearly as readily and caused chemorepulsion, but to a lesser degree. The spermicide Nonoxynol-9 also inhibited growth and caused significant chemorepulsion. The minimal concentrations of many compounds which inhibited growth were very similar to those which caused significant chemorepulsion. Imidazole and antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) which did not inhibit growth did not induce any chemotactic effects. Chemotaxis of T. vaginalis is an active and dynamic process, and the organisms display chemorepulsion shortly after exposure to toxic antimicrobial agents, well before toxicity can be demonstrated.\r"

This procedure may also be applicable to human tissues and fluids. In addition to the improved sensitivity, this method differs from all previously described systems because it is based on inhibition by sulbactam of a cell-free beta-lactamase incorporated in the assay agar. The assay is unaffected by the presence of ampicillin even at concentrations 10 times that of the sulbactam concentration. This report describes the analytical technique as well as the accuracy and precision of the method. The assay can be applied to tissue depletion studies.\r"

The susceptibilities of about 1,600 clinical isolates to ME1206 were determined by the agar dilution method. ME1206 showed a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ME1206 was more active than cefaclor, T-2525, and cefixime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of ME1206 was comparable with that of T-2525, but ME1206 was less active than cefixime. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, ME1206 had high activity (MIC, less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml). ME1206 was stable against various beta-lactamases, except beta-lactamases from Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Escherichia coli W3630 (Rms213). The 50% effective doses of ME1207 after oral administration against systemic infections in mice were comparable with those of T-2588 against gram-negative bacteria and about one-fourth that of T-2588 against Staphylococcus aureus Smith.\r"

Five of the nine children with a normal scan on computed tomography had abnormal SPECT studies consisting of focal hypoperfusion, diffuse hemispheric hypoperfusion, multifocal and bilateral hypoperfusion, or focal hyperperfusion. A focal lesion seen on SPECT has been found in children with tonic-clonic seizures suggesting secondarily generalised seizures. Moreover the pattern seen on SPECT seemed to be related to the clinical status. An extensive impairment found on SPECT was associated with a poor evolution in terms of intellectual performance and seizure frequency. Conversely all children with a normal result on SPECT had less than two seizures per year and normal neurological and intellectual development.\r"

Not all results supported the hypothesis that traffic noise increases the risk for IHD. The possibility of confounding cannot be excluded, although an extensive range of potential confounding variables were included in the analysis.\r"

Bona-fide cases are so uncommon that, of 125 cases diagnosed as Menetier's disease, hypertrophic gastritis, or protein-losing gastropathy treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital during the 26-year period of 1962-1987, only six cases merited an unequivocal anatomic diagnosis. Two other cases previously described proved on review to be nondiagnostic in one instance and Campylobacter pylori gastritis in the other. Because abnormalities in the secretion of gastric acid and in the loss of protein from the stomach may coexist, a representation of each case in semiquantitative terms can be described on triaxial coordinates. Three patients had a hypercoagulable state, one in association with gastric carcinoma. One other case of gastric carcinoma and one of esophageal carcinoma coexistant with Menetrier's disease were identified. Administration of subcutaneous heparin during the perioperative period to patients with Menetrier's disease is appropriate regardless of whether or not hypercoagulation or carcinoma is manifest. If treatment with anticholinergic drugs and inhibitors of gastric acid secretion fails, total gastrectomy is the best solution, because it stops protein loss, eliminates hyperchlorhydria, prevents development of gastric carcinoma, and permits anastomotic reconstruction between normal esophagus and normal small bowel.\r"

These contaminating leukocytes could cause artifactual alterations in standard in vitro tests of lymphocyte function. Thus, we compared the in vitro blastogenic response of density gradient purified leukocytes and T-cell purified lymphocytes from 13 burn patients to mitogenic (PHA) and antigenic stimuli. The mitogenic and antigenic response of the patients' density gradient purified leukocytes were impaired compared to healthy volunteers (p less than 0.01). However, when the contaminating nonlymphocytes were removed, the patients' cells responded normally to both stimuli. Thus, density gradient purified mononuclear cells from burn patients are contaminated by leukocytes that are not phenotypically or functionally lymphocytes. Since the lymphocytes from burn patients respond normally to PHA and alloantigens after the contaminating nonlymphocyte cell population has been removed, it appears that in vitro assays of lymphocyte function using density gradient purified leukocytes may give spurious results.\r"

The effects of locally applied, biosynthetic human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) on tensile strength of experimental incisions were investigated. A single dose of EGF in saline failed to increase tensile strength over controls. Thus, EGF was incorporated into multilamellar liposomes, which prolonged the exposure of incisions to EGF (p less than 0.001). A single dose of EGF in multilamellar liposomes produced a 200% increase in wound tensile strength over controls between 7 and 14 days (p less than 0.05). Light and electron microscopy of the wounds revealed increased collagen formation and fibroblast proliferation. A single dose of TGB-beta in a collagen vehicle stimulated a 51% increase in wound tensile strength at 9 days (p less than 0.01). We conclude that addition of EGF and TGF-beta in appropriate vehicles stimulates early transient increases in wound tensile strength in normal rats.\r"

In Group 2 (7 patients), 100 mg of allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) was added to the solution. In both groups, blood samples were taken from the coronary sinus before the aorta was clamped and 20 minutes after myocardial reperfusion was achieved. The blood samples were used to study the patients' chromosomes. The results were given as the percentage of chromosomal aberrations observed in 100 mitoses. There were no significant differences between the preischemic values in both groups and the postischemic values in Group 2. On the other hand, there was a significant difference between the postischemic values in Groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, reperfusion following myocardial ischemia in cardiac operations can produce clastogenic aberrations. This clastogenic activity can be reduced by adding allopurinol to the cardioplegic solution.\r"

Low body weight was the only univariate predictor (p less than 0.05) of an increased likelihood of complications overall. Prior cardiac operation, low serum cholesterol value, and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time were associated with increased bleeding. Electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with prolonged postoperative confusion. Age of 80 years or more and increased cross-clamp time were predictive of pulmonary dysfunction. Low cardiac output occurred more frequently in patients with nonsinus rhythm, prior cardiac operation, recent congestive heart failure, or elevated level of blood urea nitrogen. Identification of risk factors for specific complications should prompt further studies to define ways of reducing morbidity and the resultant high cost associated with CABG in elderly patients.\r"

The CABG '85 patients had a significantly higher (p less than 0.05) incidence of known operative risk factors including advanced age, female sex, severity of angina, history of recent infarction, triple-vessel disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and emergency operation than the CABG '75 cohort. The clinical profile of the PTCA '85 patients closely resembled the low-risk profile found in the CABG '75 patients. Overall mortality following CABG more than doubled during the decade studied (3% versus 7%, p = 0.07). This study suggests that the increased mortality associated with CABG in 1985 is due in part to the inclusion of more high-risk patients in the surgical population. In addition, the application of PTCA removes low-risk patients from the surgical candidate pool and adds more patients requiring emergency operations, thereby further contributing to the overall decline in the clinical status of patients referred for operation.\r"

To this end, 29 patients were treated with LAK cells in conjunction with a low-dose regimen of interleukin 2 and a prolonged period of administration following LAK cell infusion. This protocol resulted in a considerable reduction in toxicity, as compared with that described in previous studies, without compromising the efficacy.

The prevalence of all psychiatric disorders was 26.5%; 10.0% were specific RDC depressive disorders, and 5.3% were disorders without depression, usually anxiety related. Another 11.2% of patients were thought to have a disorder with significant depressive symptomatology that could not be classified into a specific depressive disorder category, a finding that suggests restricted usefulness of specialty-based categories for the range of clinical presentations in primary care. The relationship of demographic variables to specific disorders was examined; there were age, sex, and marital status differences in the rates for certain disorders, although these findings need replication using large patient samples. The prevalence findings emphasize the need for research on outcome and treatment response for depression presentations in primary care.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the influence of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on the in vitro synthesis of rheumatoid factor (RF) by purified human B and T lymphocytes stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Supernatants were assayed for total IgM and RF. PGE2 at concentrations of 10(-7) M to 10(-9) M significantly inhibited RF and IgM secretion stimulated by S aureus Cowan 1, a cross-linker of B cell surface Ig. The magnitude of inhibition of RF production was significantly greater than that of total IgM at low PGE2 concentrations (P less than 0.05). In contrast, PWM-stimulated cultures were only minimally inhibited by PGE2 at all concentrations tested. Since cross-linking of surface Ig renders B cells more susceptible to inhibition by PGE2, heat-aggregated IgG (HAIgG) was added to the PWM-stimulated cultures in an attempt to increase the sensitivity of precursors of RF-secreting cells to the inhibitory effects of PGE2. Addition of HAIgG markedly increased PGE2-mediated inhibition of RF synthesis without significantly affecting IgM production. Inhibition could not be overcome by the addition of soluble T helper cell factors, indicating that PGE2-mediated suppression was not the result of an inhibitory action of T helper cells. When lymphocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were examined, HAIgG was found to be unable to induce sensitivity to PGE2-mediated inhibition of responsiveness. These results suggest that down-regulation of RF synthesis requires both cross-linking of surface Ig and the influence of PGE2. Abnormalities in this immunoregulatory mechanism may explain the ongoing production of RF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

No defect in the response of non-T cells to T cell-independent activators of B cells, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 and Epstein-Barr virus, was observed after TLI. We conclude that TLI induces a selective deficit in B cells, which respond to T cell-dependent mitogen stimulation.\r"

Heparin has been shown also to 1) stimulate platelet aggregation and platelet release reaction, 2) enhance thromboxane A2 production in platelets, and 3) neutralize prostacyclin, a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In the light of these observations, the effect of heparin on two commonly used antiplatelet agents, aspirin and dipyridamole, was investigated. It was noted that heparin reversed the antiplatelet effect of both aspirin and dipyridamole although the effect was relatively more pronounced with aspirin. Presence of aspirin in blood in vitro as well as in vivo resulted in the inhibition of release reaction and the secondary wave of platelet aggregation. In the presence of heparin, platelets previously treated with aspirin showed nearly normal platelet aggregation as well as the release reaction. This reversal by heparin of the inhibitory effect of aspirin was dose dependent; the neutralization of inhibitory effect being more pronounced as the concentration of heparin was increased at a given concentration of aspirin. The neutralization of antiplatelet effect of aspirin was observed in vitro as well as in vivo and whether heparin was added before or after the addition of aspirin. These observations suggest the need for caution in the event heparin and antiplatelet agents are administered concurrently.\r"

The phagocytic properties of peritoneal macrophages and polymorphs (PMN) were evaluated by the ingestion of 2.02 microns O fluoresceinated microspheres. The same analyses were also performed in peripheral blood. A FACStar laser-operated flow cytometer was employed. A remarkable heterogeneity of CAPD fluid cells was demonstrated, even in the absence of any obvious infection, suggesting the possible occurrence of aborted inflammatory processes. Activated T helper cells, T suppressors (CD8+/CD11+) and Fc gamma+ cells prevailed among lymphocytes, whereas variable amounts of monocytes and PMNs were present. The phagocytic activity of CAPD fluid phagocytes ranged from very depressed to normal values, whereas it was only moderately reduced in blood, suggesting local blocking phenomena, possibly due to interfering metabolites. Flow cytometry is the method of choice for a rapid and accurate analysis of phenotypic and functional properties of cells recovered from various body fluids. This study may be helpful in evaluating local immune response mechanisms in CAPD patients.\r"

Further studies showed that in a minority of high-PI CAPD patients who also had low PDE IgG and opsonic activity levels, IP Ig therapy did not significantly reduce the PI. To evaluate this phenomenon we utilized this therapy in 20 high-PI CAPD patients undergoing IP Ig therapy for an average of 24 months daily for 3 weeks (12 g every 3 weeks) and analyzed: 1) PDE IgG levels; 2) PDE opsonic activity; 3) peritoneal macrophage (PM0) membrane-bound IgG; 4) PDE Interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels; 5) PM0 membrane Fc receptor number. The results showed that in the 15 patients in whom Ig therapy reduced PI, there were long-lasting increases in the PDE IgG, opsonic activity and IL-1 levels, as well as a normal PM0 Fc receptor number and PM0 reversibly bound infused Ig. Conversely, the five patients in whom the IP Ig did not reduce the PI showed only transient increases in PDE IgG and opsonic activity levels, no PDE IL-1 increase, and the PM0 were deficient in Fc receptors and, therefore, unable to take up the infused Ig. We conclude that in high-PI CAPD patients there are different peritoneal immune defense abnormalities and that their identification is, therefore, important for the correct choice of therapy to improve these defects.\r"

To monitor contact activation in patients with sepsis, we developed highly sensitive radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for factor XIIa-Cl(-)-inhibitor (Cl(-)-Inh) and kallikrein-Cl(-)-Inh complexes using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb Kok 12) that binds to a neodeterminant exposed on both complexed and cleaved Cl(-)-Inh. Plasma samples were serially collected from 48 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of severe sepsis. Forty percent of patients on at least one occasion had increased levels of plasma factor XIIa-Cl(-)-Inh (greater than 5 x 10(-4) U/mL) and kallikrein-Cl(-)-Inh (greater than 25 x 10(-4) U/mL), that correlated at a molar ratio of approximately 1:3. Levels of factor XII antigen in plasma and both the highest as well as the levels on admission of plasma factor XIIa-Cl(-)-Inh in 23 patients with septic shock were lower than in 25 normotensive patients (P = .015: factor XII on admission; P = .04: highest factor XIIa-Cl(-)-Inh; P = .01: factor XIIa-Cl(-)-Inh on admission). No significant differences in plasma kallikrein-Cl(-)-Inh or prekallikrein antigen were found between these patients' groups. Elevated Cl(-)-Inh complex levels were measured less frequently in serial samples from patients with septic shock than in those from patients without shock (P less than .0001). Based on these results, we conclude that plasma Cl(-)-Inh complex levels during sepsis may not properly reflect the extent of contact activation.\r"

CSF-1 alone stimulated mature monocytic colony formation by human CFU-M. However, in the presence of IL-3 and erythropoietin, CSF-1 stimulated maximal immature monocytic colony formation at low concentrations and inhibited the formation of granulomonocytic, erythrocytic, and mixed colonies. Cultures with CSF-1 and IL-3 contained more immature monocytic colonies than did cultures with CSF-1 alone. IL-1 alpha alone had little effect. However, IL-1 alpha in combination with optimal concentrations of either CSF-1, GM-CSF, or IL-3 increased the number of colonies containing immature or mature monocytic colonies.\r"

  ".W": "Deoxycoformycin (DCF), an adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor, has been shown to be active in lymphoid neoplasms. The mechanism of cytotoxicity might involve accumulation of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), depletion of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP pool, induction of double-stranded DNA strand breaks, or inhibition of S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase (SAH-hydrolase). We have investigated the biochemical changes in the circulating malignant cells of patients with chronic leukemia/lymphoma who were treated with DCF (4 mg/m2 weekly). Blood samples were taken from 17 patients with 60% or more circulating leukemic cells before, 4, 24, and 48 hours and five days after the first administration of DCF. Leukemic cells were separated and studied for changes in ADA, dATP, ATP, NAD, and SAH-hydrolase levels and DNA strand breaks and the data analyzed according to clinical response. Inhibition of ADA activity was found in all except one patient at 4 to 24 hours after the first administration of DCF. dATP started to accumulate at four hours, reached a maximum level between 24 and 48 hours, and returned to base values on the fifth day. Intracellular ATP and NAD levels were transiently reduced in some of the patients. However, no correlation between these changes and a clinical response could be found. DNA strand breaks could be studied in 13 patients. A significant increase in DNA breaks at 24 to 48 hours was found in six of the seven responders but only in one of the six nonresponders. At 24 hours, SAH-hydrolase levels were reduced in all seven responders studied, but only in two of the seven nonresponders. The difference in inhibition of SAH-hydrolase was statistically significant (P = .0023). These results suggest that DNA strand breaks and inhibition of SAH-hydrolase correlate with clinical response.\r"

This phenomenon may be analogous to the platelet aggregation that leads to thrombosis in the narrowed arteries and arterioles of patients with atherosclerosis or vasospasm. A triphenyl-methyl compound, aurin tricarboxylic acid (ATA), inhibits shear-induced, vWF-mediated platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in concentrations above 200 mumol/L and in buffer suspensions of washed platelets at a concentration of 0.1 mumol/L. In a concentration-dependent manner, ATA also inhibits ristocetin-induced, vWF-mediated platelet clumping in both fresh and formaldehyde-fixed platelet suspensions. This inhibition can be overcome by increasing the concentration of vWF, following the kinetics of first order competitive inhibition. ATA prevents the attachment to platelets of the largest vWF multimeric forms found in normal plasma and of the unusually large vWF multimers derived from endothelial cells. The rate of aggregation and degree of inhibition by ATA is not accounted for by the binding of ristocetin or calcium. Arachidonic acid- and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation are not inhibited by ATA. Platelets incubated with ATA can be easily separated from the compound. However, ATA binds to large vWF multimeric forms and inhibits their ristocetin-induced interaction with platelet glycoprotein Ib. Because ATA also inhibits shear-induced, vWF-mediated platelet aggregation in vitro in the absence of ristocetin, it may be a useful prototype compound to impede the development of arterial thrombosis in vivo.\r"

Proliferative responses to these factors, when added separately as well as in combinations, were analyzed in 25 cases of human AML using 3H-thymidine incorporation and colony assays. The 3H-thymidine uptake data revealed that IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF were stimulators of AML proliferation in 19, 15, 13, and 4 cases, respectively. Epo only stimulated DNA synthesis in the cells of the single erythroleukemia case. GM-CSF stimulation was seen only in IL-3 reactive cases and GM-CSF, when combined with IL-3, could not further elevate the DNA synthesis evoked by IL-3 alone. On the other hand, in six cases, G-CSF enhanced the IL-3- or GM-CSF-stimulated thymidine uptake. These results suggest that subpopulations of AML cells that are activated by distinct CSFs (eg, IL-3/GM-CSF-responsive cells and G-CSF-responsive cells) coexist. The 3H-thymidine incorporation assay was more sensitive for measuring CSF responses than methylcellulose colony cultures, since activation of DNA synthesis was more frequently seen than induction of colony formation. DNA synthesis experiments revealed eight different CSF response patterns among these 25 cases. CSF phenotyping may be a useful addition to the morphologic classification of AML, since these patterns directly reflect the ability of the proliferating subsets of AML cells to respond to the CSFs.\r"

Cells from all the donors behaved similarly. Mouse monoclonal antibodies of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b isotypes invoked no ADCC. However, substantial ADCC was invoked by the chimeric antibody FabFc, in which Fab'gamma from mouse antiidiotype is thioether-bonded to human normal Fc gamma. Similar results were obtained on testing LAK cells from a normal donor against uncultured human lymphoma targets coated with native or chimeric antiidiotype. The ADCC invoked by the mouse-human chimeric antibodies appears to depend on the human Fc gamma they display and not on the univalency of the derivatives used. The findings imply that LAK technology could usefully augment serotherapy that uses antibody derivatives displaying human Fc gamma.\r"

  ".U": "89062739\r", 
  ".W": "Serial observations of blast cell colony development from spleen cells of mice treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) four days earlier revealed that either form of human interleukin-1 (IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta) hastens the emergence of interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent blast cell colonies. This activity was essentially indistinguishable from the effect of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the same system, an effect that we have ascribed previously to a shortening of the G0 period of the dormant stem cells. We also analyzed the time courses of colony formation from cultures of day-2 post-5-FU marrow cells supported by IL-1 alpha, IL-6, or G-CSF alone or in combination with IL-3. In the presence of IL-3, G-CSF and IL-6 but not IL-1 alpha hastened the development of colonies and increased the numbers of multilineage colonies relative to cultures of IL-3 alone. This observation, together with our previous data from the human system, suggests that the synergistic effect of IL-1 is likely due to induction of secondary growth factors, including IL-6 and G-CSF, by accessory cells in culture. The effect of IL-6 on G0 was confirmed by analysis of the cycling status of progenitor cells in short-term culture. While neither IL-3 nor IL-6 alone had any effect on the cycling status, the combination of factors resulted in a rapid recruitment of quiescent cells into cell cycle (within 48 hours) as represented by a twofold increase in the numbers of multipotential progenitors and a significant increase in the sensitivity of these cells to 3H-thymidine with high specific activity. Combinational testing of all of these synergistic factors revealed that the target cell populations for the IL-1, IL-6, and G-CSF overlap considerably, suggesting that they all may act through a common mechanism. This is further supported by our finding that cells from blast cell colonies grown in the presence of a combination of any one of the synergistic factors with IL-3 replate with higher efficiency and yield more multilineage secondary colonies than those from colonies grown in IL-3 alone. These findings provide further evidence that IL-1, IL-6, and G-CSF serve to integrate the immediate host responses to infection through augmentation of effector cells and antibody production as well as the longer term host responses by recruitment of dormant hemopoietic stem cells into active cell cycling.\r"

When compared with DNA from leucocytes of healthy controls, the ornithine decarboxylase and erb-A1 genes were substantially hypomethylated in all samples obtained from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia. Hypomethylation of genes, particularly growth-related sequences, might be a crucial fact in the malignant transformation of human leucocytes. Its relatively simple detection from blood samples may prove clinically applicable in monitoring patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia.\r"

One patient with minimal residual myelopoiesis responded transiently to two separate courses of GM-CSF at 4 and 8 micrograms/kg/d administered intravenously and another course at 4 micrograms/kg/d administered subcutaneously. Septicemia and bilateral pneumonia that had been resistant to conventional therapy resolved. Three patients with no evidence of residual myelopoiesis did not respond to GM-CSF. In one patient, the dose was increased to 32 micrograms/kg/d with no effect on hematopoiesis. Immediate side effects were minimal at GM-CSF doses up to 16 micrograms/kg/d. GM-CSF may, however, have been involved in the pathophysiology of thrombosis of the inferior vena cava in the patient administered 32 micrograms/kg/d. We conclude that GM-CSF does not induce hematopoiesis in long-standing, severe, treatment-resistant aplastic anemia with complete myelopoietic failure. However, in patients with minimal residual myelopoiesis, GM-CSF could be a promising adjuvant therapy for severe infection.\r"

Upon the addition of 50 U/mL (2.4 ng/mL) of recombinant IL-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha) to lymphoid long-term bone marrow cultures at their initiation, very few B lymphocytes could be detected, and the majority of cells present were myeloid. This inhibition of B lymphopoiesis did not appear to be due to effects on proliferation of mature B cells because IL-1 did not affect the proliferative response of B cells to form B-cell colonies (CFU-B). The actions of the monokine were further examined by using myeloid and lymphoid long-term bone marrow culture systems. The transfer of myeloid long-term bone marrow cultures to lymphoid conditions usually results in the cessation of myelopoiesis and initiation of B lymphopoiesis. Exposure of early B-cell precursors present under the myeloid conditions to 50 U/mL of RIL-1 did not affect their subsequent differentiation into B cells upon transfer of the cultures to lymphoid conditions. However, myelopoiesis was sustained, and B lymphopoiesis did not initiate if 50 U/mL of rIL-1 was added to myeloid bone marrow cultures at the time of their transfer to the lymphoid conditions and during biweekly feedings thereafter. Upon removal of IL-1, myelopoiesis ceased, and B lymphopoiesis initiated. Thus, the effects of IL-1 on inhibition of B lymphopoiesis are reversible.\r"

Recombinant mouse IL-6 protein induces differentiation of mouse myeloid leukemic cells that are induced to differentiation by MGI-2, and monoclonal antimouse-MGI-2 antibody, which neutralizes MGI-2, also completely neutralizes this IL-6-induced differentiation. These results show that the major type of mouse myeloid differentiation-inducing protein (MGI-2A) and IL-6 are very similar and most likely identical proteins. Recombinant human IL-6 (also called interferon-beta 2 or B-cell differentiation factor), which shows only a 41% similarity to mouse IL-6, has 11 identical amino acid residues out of the 22 in the mouse MGI-2A peptide and also induces differentiation of the same myeloid leukemic cells.\r"

By applying the sigmoidal Emax model the mean (+/- SD) plasma famotidine concentrations associated with an intragastric pH of 4.0 in patients and healthy subjects were estimated to be 17.7 +/- 10.7 and 24.8 +/- 10.3 ng/ml, respectively (not significantly different). No significant differences were observed in the mean pharmacokinetic parameters between the two study groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that not only a pharmacokinetic factor (i.e., elimination t1/2) but also a pharmacodynamic (or sensitivity) factor (i.e., a drug concentration associated with an intragastric pH of 4.0) contributed significantly (p less than 0.01) to the overall variability in the duration of antisecretory effect in our study subjects, with standardized partial regression coefficients of 0.54 and -0.63, respectively. Based on these data, we predict that around-the-clock control of a fasting intragastric pH above 4.0 can be attained by a continuous infusion of famotidine at rates ranging from 6 to 25 mg/day (mean +/- SD, 11 +/- 7 mg/day) in a 70 kg patient whose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics are similar to those of our patients.\r"

Thus far, 28 cases (1-13) of this entity have been described, but after careful clinical and histological staging, no other sites of extrahepatic involvement were demonstrated in 17 of these cases (2,3,5-13). We recently had the opportunity to investigate and manage a case of true primary malignant peripheral T-cell lymphoma of the liver in a 22-year-old man. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a primary T-cell lymphoma of the liver. The patient was successfully treated with a right trisegmentectomy and no tumor recurrence has appeared after five years.\r"

  ".U": "89064584\r", 
  ".W": "The rapid proliferation of a tissue often requires the local production of a specific growth factor. The ovarian follicle is a rapidly growing tissue which contains two primary somatic cell types, granulosa cells and theca cells. Theca cells and granulosa cells were isolated from bovine ovaries and cultured to assess the possible local production of a growth factor within the ovarian follicle. Serum-free conditioned medium from theca cells, but not from granulosa cells, was found to contain a component that specifically bound to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Therefore, theca cells appear to produce an EGF-like substance as a potential regulator of follicle cell growth. This result provides physiological significance to the previous observation that granulosa cells contain EGF receptors and respond to EGF to increase cell proliferation. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) is a protein that is structurally and functionally related to EGF and binds to the EGF receptor. Using a molecular probe to TGF alpha, theca cells were found to express the TGF alpha gene, which is consistent with the presence of an EGF-like substance in conditioned medium, but granulosa cells had no detectable TGF alpha gene expression. Similar analysis with a molecular probe to EGF demonstrated the apparent lack of EGF gene expression in theca cells or granulosa cells. As previously demonstrated with granulosa cells, the data presented indicate that theca cells also contain high affinity EGF receptors. TGF alpha was found to stimulate the growth of both granulosa and theca cells. These observations imply that within the ovarian follicle TGF alpha is produced by theca cells, which can subsequently have both a paracrine and an autocrine role in regulating follicle cell proliferation. Results presented demonstrate production of TGF alpha by a normal adult mesenchymal tissue and provide an example of a growth factor-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial cell interaction between theca cells and granulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship of maximal testosterone production to the amounts of cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (P450(17) alpha), and iron sulfur protein (ISP) reductase was determined in Leydig cells from four inbred strains of mice (RF/J, SWR/J, C3H/He, and DBA/2). The amounts of P450scc, P450(17) alpha, and ISP reductase were also determined in adrenal glands of the same mice. cAMP-stimulated testosterone production and P450scc protein were high in RF/J and SWR/J compared to C3H/He and DBA/2 Leydig cells. A significant correlation between the amount of this enzyme and the capacity for testosterone production was found (r = 0.89; P less than 0.0005). ISP reductase was highest in RF/J, SWR/J, and C3H/He Leydig cells, which are significantly different from DBA/2. No significant differences in the amount of P450(17) alpha in Leydig cells from the four strains could be detected, and neither ISP reductase nor P450(17) alpha correlated with testosterone production. To ascertain if tissue-specific factors affect the expression of these enzymes, P450scc, ISP reductase, and P450(17) alpha were quantitated in adrenals from the same mice. P450scc and ISP reductase were expressed differently in adrenals compared to Leydig cells; levels of both proteins were high in C3H/He and RF/J adrenals compared to SWR/J and DBA/2. P450scc and ISP reductase were coordinately expressed in the adrenal, unlike in Leydig cells. P450(17) alpha was not detected in mouse adrenal glands. The results of this study suggest that strain-related differences in the capacity of Leydig cells for testosterone production may be determined by the amount of P450scc per Leydig cell. The expression of P450scc and ISP reductase in Leydig cells and adrenal glands appears to be influenced by both genetic and tissue-specific factors.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the contribution of dopamine (DA) to the control of PRL secretion during the preovulatory PRL surge. Immature female rats were injected with PMSG on day 28. At selected times during the periovulatory period, rats were injected with different pharmacological agents, and jugular blood was collected at frequent intervals. Blood PRL levels in vehicle-treated rats were low on the morning of day 30, rose 15- to 20-fold to peak levels from 1400-1500 h, were maintained at a plateau from 1900-2300 h, and were reduced to basal levels on the morning of day 31. Haloperidol, a DA antagonist, induced a 20-fold rise in PRL before the surge, a 2-fold rise above peak PRL levels at 1500 h, and a 50-fold rise on the morning of day 31. In contrast, haloperidol failed to alter PRL release during the plateau phase. Apomorphine, a DA agonist, reduced PRL levels when injected during either the peak or the plateau phase. Injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan, a serotonin precursor, increased PRL levels at all times examined. Anterior pituitary PRL content was reduced to 30% and 10% of the presurge level during the peak and plateau phases, respectively, but increased on the morning of day 31. Basal PRL release by hemipituitaries incubated in vitro paralleled the anterior pituitary PRL content, with markedly less PRL secreted during the peak and plateau phases compared to the presurge period. However, the percent inhibition of PRL release by hemipituitaries incubated with 50 nM DA was similar at all times tested. These data indicate that the peak PRL surge occurs in spite of DA input to the anterior pituitary, a continued responsiveness to DA inhibition, and a diminishing pituitary PRL content. We conclude that a nondopaminergic mechanism, possibly involving a PRL-releasing factor, is responsible for the peak. The plateau phase probably results from an absence of DA input to the anterior pituitary together with a reduction in the releasable pool of PRL. The termination of the PRL surge is caused by the restoration of DA input.\r"

  ".U": "89064599\r", 
  ".W": "Acute ethanol exposure produces activation of the brain-pituitary-adrenal (BPA) axis, resulting in the release of ACTH, beta-endorphin, and glucocorticoids. While elevated levels of plasma glucocorticoids are also found after chronic ethanol administration, plasma ACTH and beta-endorphin are normal or reduced. It is also unclear whether chronic ethanol exposure results in tolerance to the stimulatory effect of ethanol on BPA activity. To determine the site and mechanism of ethanol action on the BPA axis we studied the CRF secretory profile in a superfused rat hypothalamic preparation after chronic ethanol administration in vivo and the CRF responses after acute ethanol exposure in vitro. Superfused hypothalami from normal and pair-fed control rats released CRF-like immunoreactive material (CRF-LI) in a pulsatile manner, with a mean (+/- SE) frequency of 5.1 +/- 0.7 pulses/h. In contrast, the pulse frequency of CRF-LI release from hypothalami of rats receiving chronic ethanol treatment (fed an alcohol-containing liquid diet for 2 weeks) increased dramatically; the basal mean CRF level, pulse amplitude, and pulse duration remained unchanged. Hypothalamic CRF content was decreased. This chronic ethanol exposure also altered the dose-response characteristics of CRF release when ethanol was introduced acutely, as a pulse, into the in vitro preparation. Acute exposure to 20 mg/100 ml ethanol produced greater release of CRF-LI from control hypothalami than from chronic ethanol-exposed hypothalami. A further elevation above basal levels was produced by 200 mg/100 ml ethanol in control, but not ethanol-exposed, hypothalami. Secretion of CRF from ethanol-exposed hypothalami in response to depolarizing concentrations of potassium chloride was suppressed. Chronic ethanol treatment had no effect on CRF-LI and CRF bioactivity responses to stimulation with acetylcholine. These findings suggest the presence of a high frequency pulse-generating mechanism for CRF release in the hypothalamus. This pulsatile secretory mechanism is altered by chronic ethanol exposure of the animals in vivo. Chronic intoxication resulted in tolerance to the stimulatory effect of ethanol on CRF release in vitro.\r"

In the present study, growth zone and cartilage and reserve zone matrix vesicles and plasma membranes were isolated from confluent chondrocyte cultures and incubated with hormone for 3 and 24 h in vitro. Addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to GC matrix vesicles and plasma membranes resulted in dose-dependent increases in ALPase and PLA2 specific activities in both membrane fractions. Addition of 24,25-(OH)2D3 to RC membrane fractions stimulated matrix vesicle ALPase at 10(-7) and 10(-8) M and plasma membrane ALPase at 10(-8) M only. However, 24,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited matrix vesicle and plasma membrane PLA2 activity. The effects of the vitamin D metabolites were noticed after both 3 and 24 h. Neither hormone metabolite had any effect on these enzymes in membrane fractions from cultures of neonatal rat muscle mesenchymal cells, which do not calcify their matrix in vivo. These data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 24,25-(OH)2D3 can directly affect chondrocyte membrane enzymes without genomic influence or protein synthesis and that membrane response depends on the stage of chondrocyte differentiation. Changes in PLA2 activity may change membrane fluidity and may be a mechanism by which the hormones affect cell membranes.\r"

The EGF binding of normal male mice and testosterone-treated females was higher than in normal females. Due to diminished receptor concentration, hepatic EGF binding was decreased in male and female lit/lit mice to a level that was unaffected by gender or androgen treatment. GH replacement therapy by intermittent injections and continuous infusion restored the EGF binding of hypophysectomized mice to normal male and female levels, respectively, suggesting a role for the more pulsatile GH secretion in normal males. In lit/lit mice, however, both continuous and intermittent GH resulted in EGF binding levels comparable to those in normal females. In normal males continuous GH suppressed EGF binding. In conclusion, endogenous GH secretion induces EGF receptors in mice and this effect may be modulated by sex differences in GH secretion.\r"

DNA fragments of different sizes, i.e., oligonucleotide (N20-30) or oligonucleotide (N10-100), were covalently linked either to human gammaglobulin (HGG) and used as tolerogens or to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as immunogens. Experiments were done to determine whether such tolerogens specifically diminish antibodies to denatured DNA, native DNA, or both. PBL were obtained from 87 patients with SLE, 55 of whom spontaneously produced anti-DNA antibodies in vitro. Furthermore, of these 55 test subjects 23 made anti-DNA antibodies in response to antigen challenge in vitro. Exposure of PBL to tolerogenic oligonucleotide-HGG reduced spontaneous antibody formation in 34 of the 55 patients' PBL and abrogated the in vitro-induced response in all instances. The suppression was tolerogen specific. In some SLE patients lymphoid cells were suppressed by both (N10-100)-HGG and (N20-30)-HGG, while in others lymphoid cells were suppressed by only one. Longitudinal studies of spontaneous antibody production showed that the same tolerogens consistently reduced anti-DNA antibody formation in lymphoid cells of 12 patients on several occasions over a 2-yr interval, but in 8 others the results were either variable or inconsistent. In contrast, tolerogens consistently abrogated the antigen-induced response in all 23 patients' PBL. These results obtained in humans in vitro suggest that the principle of carrier-determined tolerance could be applied as a specific therapy for SLE in vivo.\r"

With single intraperitoneal injections of IL-1 the plasma iron concentrations decreased significantly in mice with either normal neutrophil counts or neutropenia. After single injections transferrin concentrations were not significantly changed, but the decrease in serum iron lowered mean transferrin saturations from a baseline of 45 to 24-30% in nonneutropenic mice, and from 99 to 70-77% in neutropenic mice. Similar changes were observed after intraperitoneal injections of Escherichia coli. 4-d continuous infusions of IL-1 also led to reductions in serum iron concentrations, but transferrin concentrations doubled. The combination of a decrease in serum iron and an increase in transferrin concentration after chronic infusion in neutropenic mice led to a greater decline in mean transferrin saturations, from a baseline of 110 to 25%. In mice not given cyclophosphamide, chronic IL-1 infusion was associated with a reduction in mean hemoglobin concentrations from 14.7 to 13.5 g/dl, consistent with restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis associated with low saturation of transferrin. We conclude that IL-1 can decrease the serum iron despite profound peripheral neutropenia and that transferrin in a positive acute phase reactant in the mouse.\r"

  ".W": "In inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, functions of chondrocytes including synthesis of matrix proteins and proteinases are altered through interactions with cells of the infiltrating pannus. One of the major secreted products of mononuclear inflammatory cells is IL-1. In this study we found that recombinant human IL-1 beta suppressed synthesis of cartilage-specific type II collagen by cultured human costal chondrocytes associated with decreased steady state levels of alpha 1 (II) and alpha 1(IX) procollagen mRNAs. In contrast, IL-1 increased synthesis of types I and III collagens and levels of alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), and alpha 1(III) procollagen mRNAs, as we described previously using human articular chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts. This stimulatory effect of IL-1 was observed only when IL-1-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. The suppression of type II collagen mRNA levels by IL-1 alone was not due to IL-1-stimulated PGE2, since addition of indomethacin did not reverse, but actually potentiated, this inhibition. Continuous exposure of freshly isolated chondrocytes from day 2 of culture to approximately half-maximal concentrations of IL-1 (2.5 pM) completely suppressed levels of type II collagen mRNA and increased levels of types I and III collagen mRNAs, thereby reversing the ratio of alpha 1(II)/alpha 1(I) procollagen mRNAs from greater than 6.0 to less than 1.0 by day 7. IL-1, therefore, can modify, at a pretranslational level, the relative amounts of the different types of collagen synthesized in cartilage and thereby could be responsible for the inappropriate repair of cartilage matrix in inflammatory conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Infection of monocyte-macrophages with human immunodeficiency virus may be central to the pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The ability of infected macrophages to prime T cells through IL-1 production was investigated in vitro. Purified human monocytes maintained in suspension culture were infected with strain HIV-DV. Intracellular expression of virus p24 antigen increased from undetectable levels immediately after infection to 13-59% of cells by 10-14 d; infected macrophages remained viable for up to 60 d. Supernatants collected between 14 and 20 d after infection were examined in the murine thymocyte co-mitogenesis assay and demonstrated to contain a potent IL-1 inhibitor, designated contra-IL-1. Contra-IL-1 activity was present in all supernatants examined after 4 d of infection, and peaked coincident with peak p24 antigen expression. Inhibitory activity was not present in uninfected cells. Contra-IL-1 activity eluted after gel filtration with an approximate molecular weight of 9 kD. Inhibitory activity was removed by exposure to heat or acid pH, or by incubation with chymotrypsin or staphylococcal V8 protease. Contra-IL-1 did not inhibit IL-2- or IL-4-dependent proliferation of murine T cell lines. Despite its ability to inhibit IL-1 activity, contra-IL-1 did not interfere with the binding of recombinant IL-1 beta to a fibroblast cell line. Contra-IL-1 inhibited the proliferation of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells to both concanavalin A and tetanus toxoid; inhibition could be attenuated by the addition of exogenous IL-1. Messenger RNA extracted from infected macrophages was examined by Northern analysis for the presence of message to IL-1 beta. No message was apparent, suggesting that the presence of contra-IL-1 was not obscuring the concomitant release of IL-1. Infected macrophages stimulated with endotoxin generated readily detectable message for IL-1 beta. Spleen macrophages purified from two patients with AIDS complicated by immune thrombocytopenia spontaneously expressed p24 antigen in vitro and released contra-IL-1 activity into the media. Contra-IL-1 may contribute to the immune dysfunction of AIDS.\r"

These cells were type specific as they proliferated and produced IL 2 when stimulated by an epitope in the amino-terminal half of gp 120 of HIVSF2, but not by a similar region of HIVZr6, a Zairian HIV-1 isolate. These two viruses differ by 26% in the deduced amino sequence of the gp 120 protein. Moreover, the antigenic site(s) recognized by the cloned T cells are distinct from those recognized by envelope-specific antibodies.

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated that recombinant soluble CD4 protein (rsT4) blocks both HIV-1 infection of CD4 bearing lymphocytes and syncytium formation in vitro. (Recombinant soluble CD4 is designated by rsT4). Hence, we suggested the use of rsT4 in therapy for AIDS or the prevention of HIV-1 infection in individuals with a known risk of exposure. However, concerns arose that rsT4 might be immunosuppressive because of its implicated role in the enhancement of certain lymphocyte activation events through its engagement of MHC class II molecules on target cells. We therefore assessed the effect of recombinant soluble CD4 upon a number of functional and activation parameters of lymphocytes, including cellular proliferation, IL-2 secretion, and cytolytic capability, after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. We report here that rsT4, at 60-fold over the concentration needed to block acute HIV-1 infection in vitro, does not significantly inhibit the activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by either PHA, tetanus toxoid or allogeneic cells. These results indicate that rsT4 will potentially exert minimal immunosuppressive effects in vivo, thus supporting the feasibility of clinical trials of rsT4 in the treatment or prevention of AIDS. In addition, the implications of these results for the interactions between CD4 and MHC class II molecules during lymphocyte activation are discussed.\r"

Inhibition produced by anti-Ig was substantially reduced after even a brief delay in the addition of antibody to PMA-stimulated B cells. Anti-Ig antibody may counteract early events triggered by PMA within minutes of peritoneal B cell stimulation.\r"

  ".U": "89067476\r", 
  ".W": "The tumor promoter PMA has been shown to induce the expression of a 28-kDa/32-kDa early activation Ag, termed EA 1, on resting T cells. Under nonreducing conditions, EA 1 was detected by SDS-PAGE as a diffuse band in the 60-kDa region. In this study, this diffuse band was resolved into 56-kDa and 60-kDa bands. Endoglycosidase F treatment of EA 1 resulted in the appearance of a single band with a Mr of 48 kDa. Upon reduction, the 48-kDa band was shown to be composed of 24-kDa peptides. Diagonal gel electrophoresis showed that the major band of EA 1 was composed of a series of disulfide-linked homodimers with subunits of the same 24-kDa core protein that were differentially glycosylated. This analysis also revealed in a minor population of the EA 1 molecules, the presence of proteins of different Mr associated with the core protein. The signal requirements for the induction of EA 1 were investigated. The putative cellular action of PMA is the activation of protein kinase C (PKC). To further investigate the role of PKC activation in the expression of EA 1, the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1,2-sn-dioctanoylglycerol (diOG) was examined for its ability to substitute for PMA. DiOG induced EA 1 expression in a dose dependent manner. H-7, a relatively selective inhibitor of PKC, blocked diOG and PMA induced EA 1 expression. HA1004, a selective inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, had no effect. In kinetic studies, EA 1 expression was seen as early as 1 h in diOG- and PMA-activated T cells. However, diOG did not completely mimic PMA-induced EA 1 expression. By 18 h, diOG-induced EA 1 expression was markedly reduced, whereas PMA-induced EA 1 expression was persistent. The role of calcium in EA 1 expression was investigated. mAb against CD3 potentiated diOG-induced EA 1 expression. This potentiation appeared to correlate with the ability of the anti-CD3 mAb to induce rises in intracellular calcium. Addition of EGTA to the media blocked the potentiation of diOG induced EA 1 expression by these mAb. The role of calcium in EA 1 expression was further demonstrated by the ability of ionomycin to potentiate EA 1 expression. These results demonstrate that PKC activation is the primary pathway for the induction of EA 1. However, calcium-dependent pathways appear to have a secondary role.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have focused on the potential role of accessory molecules such as CD2, CD28, Thy-1, or TAP in the delivery of activating signals to thymocytes through antigen-independent pathways. To better understand the molecular interactions involved in the expansion of early thymic immigrants, rat mAb were raised against murine thymocyte-surface molecules and screened for their capacity to trigger thymocyte proliferation. One of these mAb (H194-112, IgG2a) was found to recognize a novel heterodimeric thymocyte-activating molecule (THAM) of Mr = 110,000 to 128,000. Flow cytometric analyses and staining patterns on frozen thymus sections subdivided adult thymocytes in three subsets expressing THAM at either low (10%), moderate (80%), or high (5 to 8%) cell-surface density; these cell groups were found to correspond, respectively, to the medullary, the cortical, and the immature CD4-CD8-, J11d+ thymocytes, in which the T cell precursor pool is included. Moreover, most (90%) day 16 fetal thymocytes were also found to upregulate THAM cell-surface expression. The THAMhigh cells were localized in the subcapsular area of the neonatal thymus and scattered throughout the adult organ. Cross-linked mAb H194-112 induced the proliferation of both immature and mature thymocytes in the presence of either PMA or IL-1 and IL-2. The observation that early thymocytes up-regulate THAM along with the IL-2R suggests that this molecule might be involved in an important activation pathway during thymocyte differentiation.\r"

The present study aimed to determine the frequency of antibody-forming cell precursors in this repertoire whose Ig V regions impart reactivity to \"self\" or autologous Ag. Clones were activated in vitro with LPS and their secreted IgM antibody was assayed for reactivity by direct binding to cell surface or intracellular Ag. An IL-4-containing lymphokine mixture was added to the clonal cultures to induce the secretion of IgG1. The reactivity of secreted IgG1 with Ag would more closely resemble the binding required to activate B cells through their monomeric surface IgM and/or IgD. The results indicate a high frequency of precursors secreting IgM with reactivity to intracellular Ag, namely 1 in 37 +/- 6 B cells, with a marked paucity of response to cell surface molecules. The repertoire was markedly deficient in precursors secreting IgG1 able to bind to intracellular Ag, with only one clone detected by the screening of 3.0 x 10(6) spleen cells. No positives were detected for cell surface Ag. This suggested that the frequency of clones in the preimmune repertoire that express IgR with sufficient affinity to bind \"self\" molecules must be very low.\r"

All of the stimulatory ability of this determinant was shown to be contained within the synthetic 14mer RNase(43-56). When this segment of bovine RNase was compared with the self murine sequence, only one amino acid difference was found, a substitution of a proline residue at position 50 for a serine residue. This substitution completely abolishes binding to the I-Ak molecule, as shown by both functional and direct binding assays. This finding shows that self/non-self discrimination not only occurs at the level of the T cell, but also can be caused by an inability of the self peptide to associate with a class II molecule.\r"

These hyperdiploid cells are of clonal origin and demonstrate discrete IgH chain gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis. In this report, hyperdiploid cells were analyzed by three-color flow cytometric techniques and found to be Ly-1+ B cells which were dull for Ly-1 and bright for surface IgM. These cells, unlike typical diploid Ly-1+ B cells, were negative for B220/6B2 and surface IgD. Hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells were found to be the predominant splenic subpopulation in animals receiving a spleen cell transfer from donors which possessed hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells. (NZB x DBA/2)F1 recipients of NZB spleen cells demonstrated a 10- to 1000-fold increase in Ly-1+ B cells in the spleen but showed no increased levels of Ly-1+ B cells in the peritoneum. Nearly all the splenic Ly-1+ B cells were hyperdiploid with the phenotype of the NZB parent. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that all the hyperdiploid cells were NZB donor cells. These findings suggest that the increase in splenic Ly-1+ B cells in the F1 recipients was due to expansion of injected splenic hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells of NZB origin. All of the F1 recipients of NZB hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells demonstrated a significant decrease in endogenous B cells as well as decreased serum IgM and anti-ssDNA autoantibodies. These studies suggest that hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells are different from typical peritoneal Ly-1+ B cells both in the lymphoid organs to which they home and in their proliferative capacity. NZB hyperdiploid Ly-1+ B cells, which may arise as a natural consequence of hyperactive Ly-1+ B cells, may play an immunoregulatory role in the spleen.\r"

  ".W": "Earlier studies have localized the Heymann nephritis (HN) autoantigen (gp330) in the coated pits of the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies of the glomerular epithelial cell. Because of these locations in the glomerular epithelial cells, it has been suggested that the HN Ag may be a receptor. The aim of our study was to search for a ligand which can bind the HN autoantigen. Normal rat serum was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions followed by Western analysis of the separated polypeptides. A reaction was revealed directly by autoradiography using 125I labeled HN autoantigen as a probe and indirectly by enzyme immunodetection using unlabeled nephritogenic autoantibody (anti-gp330) eluted from glomeruli of diseased rats followed by biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG avidin-peroxidase complex. A polypeptide of 76 kDa Mr was identified under non-reducing conditions as a serum protein reacting with the HN autoantigen. Reactivity of the 76-kDa polypeptide was lost when serum was electrophoresed under reducing conditions. Direct binding of the 76-kDa polypeptide obtained from serum to the HN autoantigen obtained from kidney suggests that the 76-kDa polypeptide may be a ligand for the autoantigen. This is the first documentation of a possible ligand for the HN autoantigen. Not only does this polypeptide bind to the HN autoantigen but it also shows direct binding with the nephritogenic autoantibody eluted from glomerular deposits. This characteristic of the 76-kDa polypeptide indicates that this serum protein may potentially play a role in the development of the glomerular lesion of active HN. Further analysis of this serum component should assist in understanding the normal function of the HN autoantigen.\r"

Late phase skin reactions were induced in atopic individuals by intradermal challenge with allergen extract (grass pollen or house dust mite) and skin biopsies were obtained 6, 24, or 48 h after challenge. Cryostat sections were examined for evidence of infiltration and activation of T cells and eosinophils. Biopsies from saline-challenged control sites were used for comparison. A substantial number of CD3+ cells were observed close to the dermal capillaries. The number of CD4+ cells showed a similar pattern but few CD8+ cells were seen. The ratio of CD4 and CD8 subsets in tissue did not relate to the CD4/CD8 ratio in the peripheral blood. Two observations suggested that T cells had become activated: first, a small number of infiltrating cells bore receptors for IL-2, and second, there was indirect evidence of IFN-gamma secretion, demonstrated by increased expression of HLA-DR on endothelial cells and de novo expression of CD4 Ag on epidermal Langerhans cells. Activated eosinophils were detected in most of the allergen-challenged biopsies. The late phase reaction diameter at 6 h correlated with the number of activated eosinophils at 48 h (r = 0.61, p = 0.05), but not with infiltration by T cells. There was a strong correlation between the numbers of CD4+ cells and activated eosinophils at 24 h (r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that interactions between T lymphocytes and eosinophils in reactions to airborne allergens may be more important than has previously been recognized.\r"

  ".U": "89067489\r", 
  ".W": "There is evidence that the initial interaction between HIV-1 and the host that is essential for infection is the specific binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to the CD4 molecule found on certain T cells and monocytes. Most individuals infected with HIV develop antibodies against the gp120 protein. Although in vitro treatment of CD4+ T cells with mAb to a specific epitope of the CD4 molecule (T4a) blocks virus binding, syncytia formation, and infectivity, it is unclear if antibodies to gp120 from an infected individual that can inhibit the binding of gp120 to CD4 is in any way related to the clinical course of disease. Our present study characterizes the binding of 125I-labeled rgp120 to CD4+ cells, and describes an assay system that measures a potentially relevant form of immunity to HIV infection, i.e., the blocking of HIV binding to CD4+ cells. Optimal binding conditions included a 2-h incubation at 22 degrees C, 4 x 10(6) CD4+ cells, and 1 nM gp120. The dissociation constant (KD) for gp120 binding to cell surface CD4 was 5 nM, and was inhibited by soluble CD4 and by mAb to T4a but not to T3 or T4. For the binding inhibition assay, negative controls included healthy seronegatives, seronegatives with connective tissue diseases, patients with HTLV-1 disease, and patients infected with HIV-2. In studying over 100 sera, the assay was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%). The majority of HIV+ sera could inhibit binding at dilutions of 1/100 to 1/1000. No correlation was noted between binding inhibition (BI) titer in this assay and clinical stage of HIV infection. In addition, there was no correlation between BI titer and HIV neutralizing activity. The BI titer was correlated with the titer of anti-gp160 (r = 0.63) and the titer of anti-gp120 (r = 0.52) antibodies determined by Western blot dilution. As with neutralizing antibodies and other forms of immune response to HIV, it is unclear what role antibody blocking of HIV binding to CD4+ cells may play in active immunity to HIV in infected individuals. This activity may prove to have some value in protection against initial HIV infection and, thus, the assay may be of use in monitoring vaccine trials.\r"

The BALB/3T3 fibroblast cell line, which proliferates in response to increasing doses of IL-1, demonstrated enhanced proliferation after a 72-h culture period when various neuropeptides were included with IL-1 in serum-free medium. Thus, bradykinin, at concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M, moderately promoted [3H]TdR incorporation in vitro in the BALB/3T3 cells, and substance P at approximately 3 x 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-7) M demonstrated minor proliferative activity. However, when the cells were cultured with IL-1 plus substance P or IL-1 plus BK, the ensuing proliferative responses, as measured by [3H]TdR incorporation, were consistently magnified greater than or equal to twofold above the anticipated additive response caused by IL-1 in combination with either of those neuropeptides. Combinations of IL-1 and SP, or IL-1 and BK, also provoked increases in cell numbers that did not occur when the mediators were tested individually. In other experiments, we tested neurokinin-A, Neurokinin-B, histamine, and serotonin. These results are discussed with respect to neurogenic contributions to the immunopathology of IL-1-mediated inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that the number and/or affinity of IL-2R expressed by activated T lymphocytes declines with age and that this decline is implicated in the age-related proliferative impairment of Ag or mitogen-stimulated T cells. In an attempt to provide a direct demonstration of such a defect, various experimental approaches were used to analyze the expression of high and low affinity IL-2R as well as their functional properties in relation to age in purified populations of murine T lymphocytes. IL-2R were induced by Con A-activation which involves a transmembrane signaling mechanism or by exposure to phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) which bypasses such a pathway. Consistent with the previously reported age-related defect in signal transduction, a major deficiency in the expression of high affinity IL-2R was observed in mitogen-activated cells derived from aged animals. As expected, PDBu-induction circumvented the transmembrane signaling defect and resulted in the restoration of a measurable amount of high affinity IL-2R expressed by cells from aged mice early after activation. The functional properties of the IL-2R expressed as a consequence of Con A or PDBu induction were investigated by assessing the proliferative response induced through the high affinity IL-2R as compared to that mediated by the beta-chain alone. Although Con A-induction resulted in a decreased expression of high affinity IL-2R by T lymphocytes derived from aged mice, the ability of these receptors as well as that of their beta-chain component to transmit a proliferative signal was identical in both age groups. In contrast, PDBu induced in both cell populations the expression of functionally aberrant IL-2R, unable to signal for proliferation unless excessively high concentrations of rIL-2 were available. The quantitative minimal estimate of the frequency of Con A-activated, IL-2-responsive cells showed a fourfold age-associated decrease, confirming the inability of a subpopulation of T lymphocytes from aged mice to express a sufficient density of high affinity IL-2R as a consequence of mitogenic activation.\r"

When added at the onset of the culture, IL-4 augmented both cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ lymphoproliferation and MHC-restricted, influenza virus-specific cytotoxicity. When added 5 or 6 days after initiation of cultures, IL-4 was highly effective at augmenting cytotoxicity, whereas no augmentation of proliferation was observed. This disassociation of the effect of IL-4 on lymphoproliferation and cytotoxicity indicated that IL-4 was providing a late signal in CTL generation. Studied at the level of CTL precursor maturation in microcultures, IL-4 was found not to increase cytotoxicity but to be required, in some cases, for the generation of cytotoxicity. Endogenous IL-4 production was observed and demonstrated to be important because neutralizing antiserum to IL-4 suppressed CTL development. In contrast to the effects of IL-4 when added later to the cultures, pulsing the lymphocytes with IL-4 before, or shortly after, exposure to antigen resulted in suppression of the CTL response. These results indicate that IL-4 has differentiative, proliferative, and suppressive effects on cell-mediated immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "Rat cytotoxic cell-generating factor (CGF) was purified from cell-free supernatants of a T cell hybridoma (6B2-B8) that constitutively produces CGF. CGF activity was assessed by its ability to generate cytotoxic cells against 51Cr-labeled T-9 cells from spleen cells of T-9-immunized rats. The purification scheme consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation, AcA 54 gel permeation, Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, Superose 12HR 10/30 gel permeation, SDS-PAGE with subsequent electroelution, and ProRPC HR5/10 reverse phase column chromatography. Overall, CGF was purified approximately 13,000-fold, with a maximum 2.5% recovery of activity, and the sp. act. of the purified CGF was approximately 19,000 U/mg. The purified CGF is distinct from the other lymphokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, T cell-replacing factor/IL-5, IL-6, and IFN-gamma. It is capable of promoting the generation of cytotoxic T cells from R1-10B5 (+) spleen cells of T-9-immunized rats and also stimulates a W3/25 (+) T cell hybridoma to express the IL-2R. The CGF has an apparent m.w. of 28,000 under non-reducing and 14,000 and 16,000 under reducing conditions. 125I-labeled CGF binds to normal thymocytes as well as splenic T cells. The highest level of binding of CGF was detected on splenic T cells derived from T-9-immunized rats that were previously shown to contain CTL precursors. The binding analysis with 125I-labeled CGF demonstrated that CGF binds to a specific cell surface molecule with an approximate m.w. of 60,000 to 70,000.\r"

  ".W": "Mutants that lack expression of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-anchored proteins were derived from the human B lymphoblastoid JY cell line. It was demonstrated that unlike wild-type cells, which normally express both a transmembrane and a PI-linked form of LFA-3 glycoprotein, the mutant cells expressed only the transmembrane form of LFA-3. [3H]Ethanolamine was not incorporated into LFA-3 of mutant cells, indicating that the anchor moiety was entirely missing. Blockade of normal biosynthesis of the PI-anchored form led to accumulation of two intermediates that may have intact and truncated polypeptide chains. The truncated LFA-3, which was not attached to the cell membrane, was secreted by mutant cells into culture supernatants. A possible division of adhesion function between the two forms of LFA-3 was studied by using the JY cell lines as targets for CTL. Wild-type and mutant JY cells formed conjugates with CTL and were subsequently lysed to a similar extent. In addition, wild-type and mutant JY cells stimulated CTL proliferation to the same extent. Antibody-blocking experiments demonstrated a predominant role for the CD2/LFA-3 pathway in interaction of both wild-type and mutant cells with CTL. Because E exclusively express only the PI-linked LFA-3 form, and this form is known to mediate cell adhesion, the present results indicate that the two distinct membrane-anchored LFA-3 forms are each capable of mediating adhesion. A possible division of signaling functions between the two forms of LFA-3 is under investigation.\r"

  ".U": "89067510\r", 
  ".W": "Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, like mast cells and basophils, carry monovalent membrane receptors with high affinity for IgE (Fc epsilon R). Cross-linking of these receptors provides the immunologic stimulus which initiates a series of biochemical events, culminating in secretion of inflammatory mediators. In an attempt to identify membrane components involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling of these cells, hybridomas were produced from splenocytes of mice immunized with intact RBL-2H3 cells. Here we report the production of a mAb (designated G63) that inhibits the Fc epsilon R-mediated secretion from RBL cells. At low degrees of Fc epsilon R aggregation, the mAb G63-induced inhibition may be complete, whereas at the maximum of secretion the inhibition is in the range of 30 to 40%. The relative degree of inhibition of secretion is dependent on the dose of mAb G63. Furthermore, inhibition requires the bivalency of G63, as the Fab fragments are inactive. The number of antigenic epitopes recognized by G63 per RBL-2H3 cell is 1.8 x 10(4) epitopes/cell, as determined by direct binding studies of 125I-labeled Fab fragments of G63. This number is 20 to 30 times smaller than that of Fc epsilon R on the same cells. The membrane component to which G63 binds has been identified by immunoprecipitation as a glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 58 to 70 kDa. All of these results, and the fact that no competition for binding to RBL cells between mAb G63 and IgE can be resolved, indicate that mAb G63 binds to a membrane component which is distinct from the Fc epsilon R. mAb G63 suppresses the Fc epsilon R-mediated rise in cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca2+ ions, known to be one of the biochemical signals involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling in RBL-2H3 cells. G63 does not affect, however, the degranulation induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Therefore, mAb G63 probably exerts its inhibitory effect on a step preceding the rise in cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Thus, mAb G63 defines a previously unidentified membrane component that is involved in one of the early steps of the RBL-2H3 activation mediated by their Fc epsilon R.\r"

  ".W": "Both the activation and the transformation of human B cells by EBV were inhibited by either the Ca2+ channel blocking agent verapamil or the combination of theophylline and dibutyryl cAMP: the day 4 and day 20 peaks of [3H]TdR incorporation were abolished; the EBNA marker was not expressed by day 10; lymphoblastoid cell lines did not arise. Short term incubation of B cells with EBV or verapamil showed that the effect of verapamil was reversible and took place early in the interaction between EBV and B cells. The effect of EBV on the early metabolic events of B cell response was thus examined in the presence and in the absence of the drugs. Compared to anti-mu stimulation, supernatant of the transforming B95-8 strain as well as that of the non-transforming P3HR1 strain induced a drug sensitive increase of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. This increase was associated with a protein kinase C translocation from the cytosol to a membrane bound compartment. Moreover, B95-8 supernatant induced phosphatidyl inositol metabolism by human B cells but at least four times less than that induced by anti-mu antibody. These metabolic events induced by EBV were significantly inhibited by anti-CD21 antibodies whereas anti-mu induced metabolic events were not. The infection of EBV negative Ramos cell line was prevented by verapamil or by theophylline + dibutyryl cAMP. Verapamil did not modify the density of EBV receptors but negatively interfered with the penetration of the virus into B cells. Thus B cell activation through the EBV receptor and virus penetration share a common metabolic pathway which is also used for transduction of the signal delivered through the membrane Ig.\r"

  ".W": "The human B1 (CD20) molecule is a differentiation Ag found only on the surface of B lymphocytes. This structurally unique phosphoprotein plays a role in the regulation of human B cell proliferation and differentiation. In order to determine whether this structure is also expressed by murine B cells, cDNA clones that encode the mouse equivalent of the B1 molecule were isolated. The longest murine cDNA clone isolated, pmB1-1, contained a 1.4-kb insert with an 873 base pair open reading frame that encodes a protein of 32 kDa. The predicted mouse B1 protein contains three hydrophobic domains that may span the membrane four times and shares a 73% amino acid sequence homology with the human B1 protein. The pmB1-1 cDNA probe was used to examine mB1 mRNA expression. Northern blot analysis indicated that pmB1-1 hybridized with two mRNA species of 2.3 and 3.0 kb that were expressed only in murine spleen lymphocytes, in B lineage cell lines representing mature B cells, and were weakly expressed in one of two plasmacytoma cell lines. pmB1-1 failed to hybridize with RNA isolated from murine T cell lines, thymus, and nonlymphoid tissues. Southern blot analysis indicated that mB1 was encoded by a single copy gene. In situ hybridization localized the mB1 gene to chromosome 19 band B, a region that also contains the genes that encode the Ly-1, Ly-10, and Ly-12 Ag. These results suggest that only B cells express this heretofore undescribed murine cell-surface protein that is structurally homologous with the membrane-embedded human B1 Ag.\r"

The suppression depended on the concentration of PMN in the IL-2 culture, and required intact PMN. However, PMN did not require treatment with immunoregulators such as IL-2, LPS, or TNF to express the suppressive activity, and no direct contact with PBL was needed for the suppression. Addition of anti-TNF antibodies had no effect on the suppression, suggesting that no endogenous TNF in the culture was involved in the suppression. PMN did not inhibit LAK function by preventing utilization of IL-2 by PBL or by selective depletion of NKH-1+ cells which constitute the majority of LAK precursors in PBL. The suppression was reversed by superoxide dismutase but not by catalase, suggesting that superoxide anion, not hydrogen peroxide, was involved in the suppression. No other suppressive factor was detectable in PMN culture supernates. Our results of PMN regulating LAK induction in vitro suggest that PMN may have a role in determining the outcome of immunotherapy with IL-2 in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports suggested a correlation between decreased expression of tumor cell MHC class I Ag and increased susceptibility to NK cells. These studies led to the hypothesis that tumor cells displaying reduced levels of MHC class I Ag have reduced tumorigenicity in vivo because they are eliminated from the host by endogenous NK cells. The present studies use the murine hepatoma BW7756 and a spontaneous H-2Kb loss variant, Hepa-1, to test this hypothesis. The parental BW7756 tumor is highly malignant in syngeneic C57L/J hosts while Hepa-1 cells do not give rise to tumors, suggesting that the loss of H-2Kb Ag expression correlates with decreased tumorigenicity and NK susceptibility. Hepa-1 cells were therefore transfected with an H-2Kb gene to generate H-2Kb Ag expressing clones. The resulting clones were tested for tumorigenicity. Syngeneic or NK-deficient C57BL/6-beige/beige mice challenged with Hepa-1 or the H-2Kb transfectants rejected the cells, suggesting that reexpression of H-2Kb Ag does not restore tumorigenicity and that NK cells are not involved in Hepa-1 rejection. In vitro H-2Kb Ag-negative and -positive Hepa-1 cells are equally susceptible to tilorone-boosted NK cells, indicating that MHC class I Ag expression also does not affect in vitro NK susceptibility. Tumor challenged athymic nude and sublethally irradiated syngeneic mice develop tumors demonstrating that T cells are probably responsible for rejection of the Hepa-1 tumor, and that H-2Kb Ag expression has no effect on rejection. Inasmuch as the expression of H-2Kb Ag on Hepa-1 cells does not effect tumorigenicity or in vitro NK susceptibility, the previously reported association between reduced MHC class I Ag levels and increased NK susceptibility is not universally applicable.\r"

In this report, we analyzed the efficacy of three ricin A chain-containing immunotoxins (IT-A) which recognize different epitopes on the CD2 molecule (E rosette receptor) on human T cells. Although all IT-A had similar binding avidities and A-chain activities, one (RFT11-A) was 100-1000-fold more effective in killing normal and malignant T cells than the others (35.1-A, 9.6-A). Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that all IT-A bound to the CD2 molecule. However, cross-blocking experiments, differential proteolysis with trypsin, and T cell co-activation experiments showed that the less effective IT-A, 35.1-A and 9.6-A, bound to an epitope far from the cell membrane (region I), whereas the more effective IT-A, RFT11-A bound to an epitope closer to the membrane (region II). Using cellular RIA and immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown that both RFT11-A and 35.1-A were rapidly internalized by T cells, but that their intracellular fates differed. The more toxic IT-A, RFT11-A, was retained for longer periods of time inside the cells and was more slowly degraded than the less effective IT-A, 35.1-A, which was rapidly transported to lysosomes, digested, and expelled. These results demonstrate that different IT-A targeting the same surface molecule can differ markedly in potency, and that the epitope recognized by an IT-A may have a significant impact on the ability of the IT-A to insert into cell membranes, translocate to the cytosol, and kill cells.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK) have been demonstrated to be cytotoxic for a variety of tumor-derived cells. Little is known of the nature of the cell surface molecules that mediate LAK cell-target cell interactions. Reported here are studies designed to develop the methodology that can lead to the identification and characterization of tumor cell surface molecules recognized by LAK cells. Results from experiments involving the pre-treatment of LAK cells and target cells (51Cr-labeled target cells or cold-blocking cells) with trypsin, neuraminidase, or sodium periodate suggest that proteins on the surface of LAK cells specifically recognized trypsin-sensitive molecules on the tumor cell surface. We extracted tumor cell membranes with detergents, and incorporated membrane proteins together with phospholipids and cholesterol onto the surfaces of cell-sized hydrophobic beads. The resulting \"pseudocytes\" block LAK mediated killing of 51Cr-labeled targets. Trypsin pretreatment of these pseudocytes significantly reduced their blocking activity. These observations suggested that we have incorporated onto the surface of pseudocytes tumor-membrane derived molecules that are specifically recognized by LAK cells. When membrane proteins from LAK resistant PBMC were incorporated onto beads, the resulting pseudocytes did not block LAK mediated cytotoxicity. It is of interest that beads coated with membrane proteins from one tumor were able to reduce LAK cell lysis of a different tumor target. Our results are consistent with the possibility that each LAK cell is polyspecific or that the LAK cell recognizes a common marker on many tumors. The methodology using pseudocytes should allow the purification and characterization of target acceptor molecule(s) and permit us to distinguish between these possibilities.\r"

Protection from nervous system latency with the superinfecting virus correlated best with levels of serum neutralizing HSV antibody before superinfection.\r"

Twenty-two patients received 400 mg of oral acyclovir and 11 received placebo, twice daily for one year. Sera collected at enrollment, after six months and 12 months of therapy, and during the first recurrence after cessation of therapy were evaluated by western blot for levels of antibodies to HSV-2, gB, gG, gC/gE, VP16, and gD. Mean levels declined by 27%-39% after one year of acyclovir. The magnitude of the decrease in antibody levels was not correlated with disease severity either during or after therapy. Patients with high relative antibody levels to gB after therapy had more-severe first recurrences after therapy than did patients with antibody levels to gB less than or equal to the median. Antibody levels were not restored after the first untreated recurrence.\r"

We compared SIV-specific antibody and antigenemia with the progression of disease in monkeys experimentally infected with SIV/Delta isolates that varied in pathogenicity. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of serial sera from macaques infected with attenuated virus revealed a persistent antibody response and no evidence of SIV antigenemia. Immunosuppressed macaques without central nervous system (CNS) infections responded similarly to initial infection, but antibody specific for gag or, less frequently, to gag and env determinants declined predictably before clinical disease. Monkeys with CNS infections, however, had little, if any, detectable antibody to either envelope or gag proteins, regardless of the duration of survival. SIV/Delta-specific antigenemia, evident only in immunodeficient monkeys, fluctuated reciprocally with antibody. Our data suggest that SIV/Delta-induced disease is dependent upon antigenemic episodes that, particularly in animals with CNS infection, appear coincident with diminished antibody.\r"

Glycoproteins of P. carinii were clearly different from rat cell glycoproteins. Multiple glycoproteins were present in P. carinii and exhibited intense reactivity to both concanavalin A and wheat-germ agglutinin. Those lectins that reacted with the electrophoretically separated proteins also stained both alcohol-fixed P. carinii and the extracellular granular material present only in P. carinii preparations. In electron micrographs of P. carinii, which were stained with colloidal-gold-labeled concanavalin A, we found that the lectin bound to the outer surface of the organisms and to the tubular extensions emanating from the exterior surface.\r"

Serial samples on 11 patients with SLE showed fluctuations in aCL levels that often corresponded to disease activity; the highest levels occurred in patients during periods of seizure activity and other neurologic events. The antibodies were not crossreactive anti-DNA antibodies as shown by the failure of DNA to inhibit binding to cardiolipin. These data suggest that the prevalence of aCL is similar in pediatric and adult SLE and that aCL levels may vary with disease activity, especially neurologic disease.\r"

Concomitant with this impairment is an increase in serum factors which inhibit interleukin-2-mediated T-cell functions. These factors are heat labile and do not behave like endotoxins. Nonetheless, treatment of burned patients with endotoxin-neutralizing regimens of polymyxin B reduces the levels of these factors, suggesting that they are generated in response to endotoxin exposure. In addition to factors which inhibit Il-2 responses burn serum contains increases of circulating soluble, cell-free Il-2 receptors. However, the level of Il-2R is not altered by polymyxin B treatment and does not appear to be a direct result of endotoxin exposure. These observations suggest that multiple causes contribute to T-cell impairment in burned patients.\r"

A time-dependent influx of leukocytes, predominantly macrophages and suppressor T lymphocytes, occurred in both the cortex and medulla following obstruction, and disappeared with release of the obstruction. Glomerular macrophages declined following obstruction but increased to levels above control following release. The influx of leukocytes following obstruction was paralleled by an increase in thromboxane B2 excretion by the kidney and coincided with a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This would suggest that an influx of immune cells is a prominent feature of the acute renal response to ureteral obstruction. These cells may modulate some of the post-obstructive alterations in renal function via the production of vasoactive substances, such as thromboxane A2.\r"

Transferred EAG developed earlier than in immunized donors and was not associated with circulating or bound anti-GBM antibodies. Control recipients did not develop disease from control cells alone, soluble antigen, or antigen plus control cells. The cells which transferred EAG appeared morphologically by light and electron microscopy to be lymphocytes, sedimented as lymphocytes, were positive with anti-serum to thymocytes but negative with anti-bursa anti-serum, stained as T-cells with monoclonal antibodies and underwent blast transformation in response to mitogen and GBM antigen. Other organ specific diseases have been transferred by cells alone; to our knowledge this is the first description of glomerulonephritis transferred by cells alone. This new pathogenetic process may play an important role in the development of glomerulonephritis in other animal models as well as in humans.\r"

During control conditions, increases in late proximal perfusion rate produced flow dependent decreases in SFP and SNGFR with maximal values of 10.2 +/- 1.0 mm Hg and 12.9 +/- 2.5 nl/min, values similar to those obtained in normal rats. During ACE inhibition (MK 422; 0.6 mg/kg/hr), arterial pressure decreased from 168 +/- 8 to 137 +/- 7 mm Hg and there was a marked attenuation in the magnitude of SFP feedback responses (delta = 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg). SNGFR feedback responses, however, were not significantly impaired. Direct decreases in renal arterial pressure reduced control SFP but SFP feedback responses were maintained, indicating that the attenuated SFP feedback responses during ACE inhibition were not due to decreased arterial pressure. Superimposed infusion of angiotensin II during ACE inhibition partially restored SFP feedback responses. In contrast, norepinephrine infusion did not result in a similar restoration of SFP feedback sensitivity. These results indicate that the nonclipped kidney of Goldblatt hypertensive rats has an intact TGF mechanism as assessed from SFP and SNGFR feedback responses. Furthermore, ACE inhibition attenuates SFP but not SNGFR feedback responses, and systemic angiotensin II infusions can restore SFP feedback responsiveness towards normal.\r"

  ".W": "Lymphocytes extracted from freshly resected melanomas can be expanded in vitro and can often mediate specific lysis of autologous tumor cells but not allogeneic tumor or autologous normal cells. We treated 20 patients with metastatic melanoma by means of adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interleukin-2, after the patients had received a single intravenous dose of cyclophosphamide. Objective regression of the cancer was observed in 9 of 15 patients (60 percent) who had not previously been treated with interleukin-2 and in 2 of 5 patients (40 percent) in whom previous therapy with interleukin-2 had failed. Regression of cancer occurred in the lungs, liver, bone, skin, and subcutaneous sites and lasted from 2 to more than 13 months. Toxic effects of interleukin-2 occurred, although the treatment course was short (five days); these side effects were reversible. It appears that in patients with metastatic melanoma, this experimental treatment regimen can produce higher response rates than those achieved with interleukin-2 administered alone or with lymphokine-activated killer cells. It is too early to determine whether this new form of immunotherapy can improve survival, but further trials seem warranted.\r"

  ".U": "89070678\r", 
  ".W": "The majority of peripheral T lymphocytes bear cell-surface antigen receptors comprised of a disulphide-linked alpha beta dimer. In an immune response, this receptor endows T cells with specificities for foreign antigenic protein fragments bound to cell surface glycoproteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). At a high frequency (greater than 1%), the same population of T lymphocytes responds to allogeneic MHC glycoproteins, or to differences at other genetic loci termed Mls, in conjunction with MHC. The alpha beta-antigen receptor has been implicated in alloreactivity and Mls reactivity. In fact, many monoclonal T-cell lines recognize a foreign protein fragment bound to self-MHC molecules and, in addition, recognize allogeneic MHC glycoproteins, an Mls-encoded determinant, or both. For at least one T-cell clone, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha beta antigen receptor has been shown to block activation induced by either antigen-bound self-MHC or by allogeneic MHC. However, it remains to be demonstrated directly that a single alpha beta receptor can mediate antigen specificity, alloreactivity and Mls reactivity, a prerequisite to understanding the structural basis of these high-frequency cross-reactivities. To address this issue we have performed transfers of receptor chain genes from a multiple-reactive T-cell clone into an unrelated host T lymphocyte. We now demonstrate definitively that the genes encoding a single alpha beta-receptor chain pair can transfer the recognition of self-MHC molecules complexed with fragments of antigen, allogeneic MHC molecules, and an Mls-encoded determinant (presumably in conjunction with MHC). In this case the transfer of antigen specificity and alloreactivity requires a specific alpha beta-receptor chain combination, whereas Mls reactivity can be transferred with the beta-chain gene alone into a recipient expressing a randomly selected alpha-chain.\r"

From experiments using permeabilized cells, membrane vesicles, and patch-clamp techniques, it has been suggested that InsP3 acts by directly opening calcium channels. Here, we show that InsP3 induced openings of channels in planar lipid bilayers into which vesicles made from aortic muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were incorporated. Activation of channels by InsP3 was not observed when vesicles made from SR of cardiac or skeletal muscle were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The present study demonstrates for the first time unique properties of an InsP3-gated calcium channel in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from vascular smooth muscle. This InsP3-activated channel from aortic SR differs strikingly from the calcium-gated calcium channel of striated muscle SR in single-channel conductance and pharmacology.\r"

It is thought to be a ubiquitous second messenger that is produced in, and released from, the plasma membrane in response to extracellular receptor stimulation. By analogy, InsP3 in muscle cells has been postulated to open calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, which is the intracellular Ca2+ store that releases Ca2+ during muscle contraction. We report here that InsP3 may have a second site of action. We show that InsP3 opens dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels in a vesicular preparation of rabbit skeletal muscle transverse tubules. InsP3-activated channels and channels activated by a dihydropyridine agonist in the same preparation have similar slope conductance and extrapolated reversal potential and are blocked by a dihydropyridine antagonist. This suggests that in skeletal muscle, InsP3 can modulate Ca2+ channels of transverse tubules from plasma membrane, in contrast to the previous suggestion that the functional locus of InsP3 is exclusively in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane.\r"

Pt-1 (ref. 2), Oct-1 (ref. 3) and Oct-2 (ref. 4), and the product of the nematode gene unc-86 (ref. 5) which is involved in determining neural cell lineage. This domain consists of two subdomains, a C-terminal homoeo domain and an N-terminal POU-specific region separated by a short nonconserved linker; the sequence relationship shows that the POU homoeo domains form a distinct POU-related family. In the ubiquitous and lymphoid-specific octamer-motif binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2, the POU domain is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding. Homoeobox domains contain a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif, first identified in bacterial repressors. The helix-turn-helix region of the POU domain is important for DNA binding and, in other classes of homoeo-containing proteins, the entire homoeo domain is sufficient for DNA binding; thus the new POU-specific region could be involved in other functions such as protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, we show here that in fact the POU domain is a novel bipartite DNA-binding structure in which the POU homoeo and POU-specific regions form two subdomains that are both required for DNA binding but are held together by a flexible linker.\r"

Polyamine analysis of the rat gliosarcoma demonstrated minimal conversion of labeled putrescine to its metabolites, spermidine and spermine, at 5 and 30 minutes after intravenous injection. The human glioblastoma also exhibited minimal polyamine conversion at 5 minutes, although there was a trend toward significant metabolism at longer time periods (30 and 45 minutes). In addition, the human glioblastoma produced nonpolyamine metabolites that suggest an alternative pathway of putrescine metabolism via gamma-aminobutyric acid. These in vivo findings are discussed in relation to the usefulness of putrescine as a marker for positron emission tomography of human gliomas.\r"

The results show that the \"cathode rostral\" orientation group of animals performed statistically significantly better on the inclined plane than either the \"anode rostral\" or the \"no current\" group. Counts of axons in the dorsal funiculi rostral to the lesion in the \"cathode rostral\" group were statistically significantly greater than in other groups.

The basis for the nuclease hypersensitivity is stable DNA unwinding as revealed by (i) the same temperature dependence for hypersensitivity and for stable unwinding of plasmid topoisomers after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, (ii) preferential nuclease digestion of stably unwound topoisomers, and (iii) quantitative nicking of stably unwound topoisomers in the A+T-rich region. Nuclease hypersensitivity of A+T-rich sequences is hierarchical, and either deletion of the primary site or a sufficient increase in the free energy of supercoiling leads to enhanced nicking at an alternative A+T-rich site. The hierarchy of nuclease hypersensitivity reflects a hierarchy in the free energy required for unwinding naturally occurring sequences in supercoiled DNA. This finding, along with the known hypersensitivity of replication origins and transcriptional regulatory regions, has important implications for using single-strand-specific nucleases in DNA structure-function studies.\r"

This element also confers serum responsiveness. Gel mobility shift assays have demonstrated that there are specific nucleoprotein complexes associated with each element and that these exist in the cell prior to NGF induction. The NGF response is independent of the cAMP-regulatory element(s) and does not require cAMP-dependent protein kinase II, as induction by NGF is retained in the mutant PC12 cell line A126-1B2. Finally, the human heat shock HSP70 promoter is also transcriptionally activated by NGF and appears to bind the same nuclear complex as the SRE-2 element of the c-fos promoter.\r"

To explore the role of the TM region in the process of receptor activation, we have generated EGF-receptor mutants with altered TM regions by utilizing in vitro site-directed mutagenesis. The TM regions of two mutant receptors were either extended (designated i626-3) or shortened (designated d625.3) by three hydrophobic amino acid residues. In the other two mutant receptors, hydrophobic amino acids were substituted by charged residues--i.e., Val-627 was replaced by glutamic acid (designated V627E) or Leu-642 was replaced by an arginine residue (designated L642R). NIH 3T3 cells lacking endogenous EGF receptors were transfected with constructs encoding either wild-type or mutant receptors and shown to express the receptor molecules using 125I-labeled EGF binding and immunoprecipitation experiments. The mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface as polypeptides of Mr 170,000 exhibiting typical high- and low-affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled EGF. Similar to its effect on wild-type receptors, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate abolished the mutant-receptor high-affinity binding sites for EGF. Moreover, EGF was able to stimulate the kinase activities of wild-type and mutant receptors both in vitro and in living cells. The mutant receptors were also able to undergo EGF-induced receptor dimerization as revealed by cross-linking experiments with a bifunctional covalent cross-linking agent. These results are compatible with an intermolecular allosteric oligomerization model for receptor activation rather than with a model based on an intramolecular mechanism for receptor activation.\r"

Intracellular sorting results in the transfer of most uncleaved gp160 to lysosomes, where it is degraded, while gp120 is transported to the cell surface and subsequently secreted. Cleavage of gp160 to generate gp120 occurs intracellularly and can be inhibited by NH4Cl. Taken together, these results indicate that intracellular cleavage of gp160 determines the intracellular transport and survival of the envelope glycoproteins necessary to produce infectious virus.\r"

To delineate its structure and relationship to alpha and delta glycophorins at the genomic level, we analyzed DNA from a three-generation family, in which both the presence of Dantu and Mi-III (another rare MNSs antigen) and the absence of delta glycophorin were seen. Three gross alterations in the gene cluster correlated with the observed phenotypes. Differential hybridization, secondary restriction analysis, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing established that Dantu glycophorin is encoded by a distinct hybrid gene derived from fusion of delta and alpha genes. The junction point of the Dantu gene was assigned to the region spanning codons 31-39 of delta and codons 72-79 of alpha genes. Dosage quantitation suggested that Dantu gene is duplicated and tandemly arranged. Identification of delta gene deletion disclosed the molecular basis for the absence of delta glycophorin in two Dantu and Mi-III double heterozygotes. The DNA inheritance pattern together with DNA typing of MN blood groups verified the genotypes and established that the duplicated Dantu hybrid gene is linked to alpha M gene as well as a delta gene deletion. The origin of such a haplotype in a segment of Black population would require two recombination events via either unequal homologous crossing-over or gene conversion.\r"

Human foreskin fibroblasts are shown to express approximately 10-fold elevated gro, myc, and fos mRNAs in response to serum and to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, with early response kinetics indicative of growth regulation. In response to interleukin 1, however, in growing cells gro mRNA is elevated at least 100-fold but myc remains constant and fos is not expressed, suggesting a second regulatory pathway. In normal cultured mammary epithelial cells, gro is constitutively expressed, and elevated mRNA levels are induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but not by interleukin 1. However, most carcinoma cell lines examined do not express gro mRNA, suggesting a third function of gro as a negative growth regulator in epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The activation of T lymphocytes requires their stimulation via clonotypic antigen receptors as well as nonantigen-specific costimulators, the best defined of which is the cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1). Recent studies have shown that murine CD4+ helper T lymphocytes consist of two nonoverlapping subsets that selectively utilize interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interleukin 4 as their autocrine growth factors and are called Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. We now show that IL-1 functions as a costimulator for the proliferation of Th2 but not of Th1 clones and only Th2 cells express high-affinity receptors for IL-1. Secretion of autocrine growth-promoting lymphokines by Th1 and Th2 cells occurs after stimulation via the antigen receptor-CD3 complex and is neither dependent on nor affected by IL-1. These findings suggest that the activation of T lymphocytes can be divided into two stages, lymphokine secretion and proliferation, and only proliferation requires costimulators such as IL-1. Moreover, the prevailing view that IL-1 functions as a costimulator by inducing secretion of IL-2 or expression of IL-2 receptors may not be generally applicable, because IL-2-producing Th1 clones do not express receptors for IL-1 and are insensitive to this cytokine.\r"

  ".W": "The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit receptor complex specific to T cells subserving both antigen recognition and signal transduction functions. The zeta chain of the TCR is a component of all surface receptor complexes. This chain was first identified in murine T cells by virtue of the fact that it coimmunoprecipitates with the TCR complex using antibodies directed against either the clone-specific subunits or invariant CD3 subunits of the receptor. Recently, we have isolated a cDNA encoding the murine zeta. Using this as a probe, we have now isolated cDNAs encoding the human zeta. Sequence analysis of cDNAs encoding human and murine zeta reveals that it is a highly conserved protein. In addition to amino acid homology, there is remarkable interspecies conservation in the nucleotide sequence of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the zeta mRNA. The previously characterized invariant delta, epsilon, and gamma chains of the TCR, referred to as the CD3 complex, share significant sequence and structural homology with each other and are all located within 300 kilobases of each other on human chromosome 11 (11q23). zeta has no sequence similarity to the CD3 chains and the localization of the human zeta gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 1 underscores the fact that it is a distinct genetic component of the TCR.\r"

  ".W": "The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse has been developed as a model for insulin-dependent diabetes. One gene required for the development of diabetes is associated with the major histocompatibility complex. This gene possibly could be linked to class II genes, which show a unique pattern in NOD mice. To evaluate the role of the I-A class II antigen expressed in NOD mice, we studied the effect of anti-I-A monoclonal antibodies on disease onset in vivo. Long-term treatment with anti-class II IgG2a antibodies specific for NOD I-A antigen prevented the spontaneous development of diabetes, as opposed to control antibodies shown not to react with NOD I-A antigen. Anti-class II antibodies apparently elicited active immune suppression, requiring a fully immunocompetent host, rather than passive blockade of class II antigen. Treatment with anti-class II antibody effectively prevented the adoptive transfer of diabetes produced by splenocytes from diabetic NOD mice into newborn mice but failed to prevent adoptive transfer into irradiated adult NOD recipients. Direct evidence for the induction of suppressor cells was obtained from the passive transfer of spleen cells from anti-class II antibody-treated NOD donors. The injection of anti-class II antibody-treated spleen cells collected from NOD donors prevented the development of diabetes, which normally follows transfer of diabetogenic spleen cells into irradiated 8-week-old male NOD recipients. Depletion experiments indicate that CD4+ cells are responsible for anti-class II-induced protection transferred by spleen cells.\r"

  ".U": "89071768\r", 
  ".W": "Cop 1 is a synthetic basic random copolymer of L-alanine, L-glutamic acid, L-lysine, and L-tyrosine in a residue molar ratio of 6.0:1.9:4.7:1.0 and with a molecular weight of 21,000 which proved to be effective in specific suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and has been proposed as a candidate drug against multiple sclerosis. In the present study we further investigated the mechanism of Cop 1 suppressive activity and tested whether Cop 1 could inhibit the specific T-cell response to myelin basic protein (BP). Eight BP-specific T-cell lines and clones with various H-2 restrictions and antigenic specificities were used. The responses of all these lines and clones to BP, as followed by both cell proliferation and interleukin 2 secretion assays, were affected by Cop 1. For one line, a direct cross proliferation with Cop 1 was observed, whereas in the other seven lines and clones, Cop 1 specifically inhibited the responses to BP in a competitive dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of the response to BP is specific to Cop 1, as D-Cop 1 and another random acidic polymer, poly(Tyr,Glu,Ala) (TGA), both of which were previously demonstrated to be ineffective in suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, did not inhibit the response to BP. Furthermore, Cop 1 specifically inhibited only the response of the T-cell lines and clones to BP. It did not inhibit their response to the mitogen Con A, nor did it inhibit the responses of the purified protein derivative-specific T-cell line and clone. These results suggest that Cop 1 may be effective in suppression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, not only because of the selective stimulation of suppressor T cells, as we have previously demonstrated, but also by specific inhibition of BP-specific effector T cells.\r"

The tat response element of HIV-2 and of SIVmac was more complex than that of HIV-1. Two structurally similar subelements within the HIV-2 tat response element could be identified. Both of these subelements were required for optimal transactivation by the HIV-2 tat gene product. Either of these subelements, however, was sufficient for transactivation by the HIV-1 tat gene product. These observations provide an explanation for the poor transactivation of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression by the HIV-2 tat gene product since the HIV-1 LTR contains an analog of only one of the HIV-2 subelements. The HIV-2 tat gene product also affected the function of the upstream elements, including enhancer activity. The response of these cis elements of HIV-2 to transactivation by HIV-2/SIVmac and HIV-1 tat gene differed somewhat in virus-infected and tat gene transfected cells, probably related to the differences in the effective concentration of the tat gene products and/or other viral or cellular factors. The steady-state levels of HIV-2 LTR-linked gene transcripts were much higher in the presence of HIV-2, SIVmac, and HIV-1 tat genes than in their absence, suggesting transcriptional modulation as a mechanism for tat gene function.\r"

Trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia obtained at autopsy were hybridized with 35S-labeled single-stranded RNA probes homologous to VZV or HSV fragments. We have reported that HSV persists in human sensory neurons and expresses only one family of transcripts that overlap extensively with, but are opposite in polarity to, the mRNA encoding the immediate early protein termed infected cell protein 0 (ICP0). In the present study we find that latent VZV infection involves nonneuronal cells, and multiple, but not all, VZV genes are transcribed. In contrast, during varicella both neuronal and nonneuronal cells are infected, with all regions of the VZV genome analyzed being expressed. Thus, the patterns of gene expression and cellular locations of VZV and HSV infections of human ganglia differ. The differences may underlie clinical features that distinguish these infections.\r"

All of the alpha 1-Pi transgenic mice expressed the human protein in the liver, cartilage, gut, kidneys, lymphoid macrophages, and thymus. The human M-allele protein was secreted normally into the serum. However, the human Z-allele protein accumulated in several cell types, but particularly in hepatocytes, and was found in serum in tenfold lower concentrations than the M-allele protein. Mice in one lineage carrying the mutant Z allele expressed high levels of human alpha 1-Pi RNA and displayed significant runting (50% of normal weight) in the neonatal period. This lineage was found to have alpha 1-Pi-induced liver pathology in the neonatal period, concomitant with the accumulation of human Z protein in diastase-resistant cytoplasmic globules that could be revealed in the Periodic acid-Schiff reaction (PAS). The phenotype of mice in the strain expressing high levels of the Z allele is remarkably similar to human neonatal hepatitis, and this strain may prove to be a useful animal model for studying this disease.\r"

In the in vitro study, we applied agents from either the intraluminal or the extraluminal side of excised basilar arteries. KCl-induced contraction was the same with either application. Acetylcholine-induced maximal relaxations were 57.6 +/- 8.5% of the contraction induced by 10(-5) M 5-hydroxytryptamine for control, 3.3 +/- 0.3% for intraluminal, and 34.9 +/- 8.6% for extraluminal applications. Adenosine triphosphate-induced maximal relaxations were 64.2 +/- 4.1% of the contraction induced by 10(-5) M 5-hydroxytryptamine for control, 26.9 +/- 3.8% for intraluminal, and 42.2 +/- 6.0% for extraluminal applications. Hemoglobin's inhibition of acetylcholine- and adenosine triphosphate-induced relaxation was significantly greater with intraluminal than with extraluminal application (p less than 0.05). The immunohistochemical study revealed hemoglobin in the outer layer of the smooth muscle and in the adventitia when 10(-5) M hemoglobin was applied extraluminally for 5 minutes, whereas hemoglobin was observed on the surface of the endothelial cells after intraluminal application. Our findings suggest that hemoglobin inhibits acetylcholine- or adenosine triphosphate-induced relaxation by binding to endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and by inhibiting production of EDRF. Hemoglobin's inhibitory effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation may be important in the pathogenesis of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in types I and II did not differ from controls indicating normal bone formation. However, a significantly decreased fasting renal excretion of phosphate and hydroxyproline in both types compared with normal controls, suggests a reduced bone resorption. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), albumin-corrected calcium, phosphate, and acid phosphatase were normal in type I. In type II serum levels of albumin-corrected calcium and PTH were significantly increased (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01). The level of acid phosphatase was markedly increased in this type (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest differences between the two types in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, and thus corroborate the evidence that the two radiological types reflect two different disorders of bone resorption.\r"

The NZW T cell receptor beta-chain complex appeared to be particularly unusual in that the C-beta-1, D-beta-2, and J-beta-2 gene segments have been deleted. Approximately one half of (NZB x NZW)F1 x NZB backcross mice developed severe renal disease and elevated levels of IgG antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and histone, suggesting that only one dominant gene or closely linked group of genes accounts for the NZW genetic contribution to F1 disease. Despite the extremely unusual nature of the NZW T cell receptor beta-chain gene complex, we found no association of disease expression with the presence of this allele in the backcross mice. There was also no correlation of disease incidence with the presence of the NZW T cell receptor alpha-chain allele. In contrast, nearly 90 percent of the backcross mice with the NZW MHC expressed severe autoimmune disease compared with 12 percent of the mice that did not carry this haplotype. Thus, the NZW MHC or gene(s) linked to this locus appears to be the only dominant NZW genetic contribution to F1 disease. Recent preliminary studies mapping genes that are located centromeric and telomeric to the NZW MHC suggest that the disease-associated gene(s) lies within the MHC.\r"

  ".W": "A mechanism for sustained production of pathogenic autoantibody subsets in patients and mice with systemic lupus erythematosus may be centered on selective up-regulation of B cells bearing certain idiotypes. Public idiotypes are characteristic of some autoantibodies, including anti-DNA. Evidence is reviewed that suggests that immunoglobulins bearing certain public idiotypes, such as IdGN2, contain autoantibody subsets that are nephritogenic in human systemic lupus erythematosus and in New Zealand black/New Zealand white F1 mice. Up-regulation of such cells could promote development of nephritis. Work from several laboratories has shown that production of immunoglobulin G antibodies to DNA depends upon T cell help. In New Zealand black/New Zealand white F1 mice, cloned T cells are dominated by autoreactive cells that produce B cell growth factors. We suggest that this sustained release of B cell growth factors combined with selection by T helper cells for B cells bearing IdGN2 are a major mechanism for sustained up-regulation of nephritogenic subsets of autoantibodies.\r"

A 9.2-kilobase PvuII RFLP was identified using the class I-specific B7 cDNA probe pDP001 that was closely associated with ankylosing spondylitis, most specifically with peripheral joint (including shoulder and hip) involvement. This fragment is associated with human leukocyte antigen A3 and A9 alleles, and segregation analysis in 11 multiplex families showed the RFLP to frequently segregate independently of B27 haplotypes. Two more recent studies have not confirmed the association of the 9.2-kilobase PvuII RFLP with ankylosing spondylitis per se, believed to be due to clinical and possibly genetic differences between the patient groups studied. These data strongly suggest at least one other major histocompatibility complex class I gene to be operative in predisposition to or modification of ankylosing spondylitis.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate M phi phenotypic heterogeneity to create a database for the correlation of M phi phenotype with specific immunologic functions. The results showed that villous stromal mononuclear cells express many cell surface antigens found on Mo and M phi s and that they are morphologically diverse, ranging in appearance from classic Hofbauer cells to spindle-shaped cells with long cytoplasmic processes. Villous stromal M phi s were the numerically dominant cell type in this structure and exhibited some major phenotypic differences from M phi s in other tissues. Comparison of first- and third-trimester placentas revealed variation in antigen expression with increasing gestational age, in particular of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) determinants: HLA-DR and HLA-DP antigen density was low on first-trimester villous M phi s and much higher on third-trimester M phi s while HLA-DQ was undetectable in the first trimester but present on cells in third trimester placentas. The CD1 (T6) antigen, found on Langerhans (LH) cells and cortical thymocytes, was detected on villous M phi s by two thirds of the MAbs directed against different epitopes on this determinant. Furthermore, comparison with similar studies of lymphoid tissues showed that villous M phi s and dendritic cells share the expression of a number of other cell surface antigens. Finally, it was shown that M phi s in first- and third-trimester villi exhibit strong reactivity with MAbs (Leu 3a,b) to the CD4 antigen that serves as the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), suggesting that these cells may be a portal of entry or reservoir for this virus in the fetuses of pregnant, HIV+ women.\r"

  ".W": "Although endoscopic sclerotherapy is effective in controlling bleeding from esophageal varices, the effects of sclerosing agents on the extrahepatic portal and splenic veins have not previously been investigated. This study of 21 men with portal hypertension and variceal bleeding compares the morphology of the portal and splenic veins in 11 who had received endoscopic sclerotherapy versus 10 patients who did not. The mean number of injections per patient was 11 +/- 5, the mean volume of 1.5 percent sodium tetradecyl injected was 23 +/- 15 ml, and the interval between the last injection and surgery was 15 +/- 6.5 days. Among the 11 patients who had endoscopic sclerotherapy, portal vein thrombosis occurred in 4 (36 percent). Two of these patients died from acute liver failure; the other two had shunt procedures. Histologic changes included intimal thickening and medial fibrosis in seven patients, thrombus in four patients, and destruction of the venous architecture in two patients. Of the 10 patients with portal hypertension who did not have endoscopic sclerotherapy, all had medial fibrosis of the portal vein, with thrombus and intimal thickening present in only 1. These findings suggest that endoscopic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices should be used cautiously in patients who may later require a shunt. Moreover, further studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of injecting sclerosing agents into the portal circulation before widespread use of prophylactic sclerotherapy can be recommended.\r"

Analysis of 19 records of patients with first episode PCP who were intubated and received mechanical ventilation showed a mortality of 57.8%. A constellation of clinical and laboratory findings was found that identified those patients more likely to survive, including a shorter duration of symptoms prior to admission, better arterial oxygenation on admission, deterioration of respiratory status soon after bronchoscopy, decrease in serum lactic acid dehydrogenase and rapid improvement in arterial blood gas determinations after institution of mechanical ventilation. Mean survival for the group that recovered from PCP after mechanical ventilation was not different from that of other patients with PCP who did not require mechanical ventilation. Thus, patients at risk for PCP should be advised to present to medical facilities as soon as symptoms of this disease develop and, when appropriate, should be encouraged to undergo intubation with respiratory support if it becomes necessary.\r"

The resulting pulmonary cells (PC) were separated into high density (HD-PC, 32 to 57%) and low density (LD-PC, 9 to 32%) fractions in a discontinuous density gradient of bovine plasma albumin (BPA). Both macrophages and dendritic cells were observed in the LD-PC by light microscopy. HD-PC, LD-PC, adherent LD-PC, nonadherent LD-PC, and a purified preparation of pulmonary dendritic cells (DC-P) were tested for accessory activity in the presence of periodate-treated, lymph-node-derived lymphocytes as responders. Most of the accessory activity was found in the LD-PC. Increasing numbers of LD-PC stimulated proliferation of responder lymphocytes in a linear, dose-dependent manner; higher numbers had a suppressive effect. Nonadherent LD-PC containing dendritic cells also produced a dose-dependent increase in periodate-induced lymphocyte proliferation, whereas adherent LD-PC, morphologically identified as macrophages, were suppressive. Removal of phagocytic macrophages from nonadherent LD-PC resulted in an eightfold increase in both the percent of DC-P present and the amount of accessory activity in the LD-PC. We conclude that pulmonary dendritic cells are potent accessory cells for periodate-induced lymphocyte proliferation.\r"

When stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes from controls released IL-1 (127 +/- 74.6 and 178.8 +/- 120 IL-1 units/ml, respectively) in the same amounts as AMs and blood monocytes from allergic asthmatics (148 +/- 47.5 and 160.5 +/- 78.3 IL-1 units/ml, respectively). After stimulation by anti-IgE or the specific allergen, asthmatic blood monocytes released IL-1-like activity (71.8 +/- 46.4 and 45.4 +/- 25.9 IL-1 units/ml, respectively). In contrast, asthmatic AM supernatants contained no detectable IL-1-like activity after stimulation by allergen or anti-IgE. The same pattern was observed with monocytes and AMs from controls after passive cell sensitization with 20% of IgE-rich serum. In a second step, the effect of supernatants of IgE-dependent stimulated AMs was tested on thymocyte proliferation induced by a purified IL-1, permitting the demonstration of an IL-1 inhibitory factor released by the AMs while these supernatants didn't modify the IL-2-dependent proliferation of a CTL-L line. The use of indomethacin and assessment of PGE2 levels in AM supernatants made it possible to discard the role of prostaglandins in this inhibitory effect. Moreover this activity, which is resistant to heat and trypsin treatment, has a molecular mass between 40 and 50 kD and did not correspond to serum proteases, alpha-1-antiproteinase, and arginase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We now have examined the involvement of peripheral blood T-cells in the NP-CM stimulation of colony-forming units (cfu) from the blood of atopic and nonatopic subjects. Because the number of BMC- and Eo-cfu was significantly higher in cultures of peripheral blood from subjects with out-of-season ragweed allergic rhinitis than from control subjects (23.8 +/- 4.1 versus 9.0 +/- 2.4, p less than 0.01), we asked whether the observed colony stimulation could be a T-cell-dependent effect. Indeed, peripheral blood target cells consisting of a reconstituted mixture of T-cells and T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (non-T-cells) yielded a significantly higher number of colonies in the presence of NP-CM than the non-T-cells alone. NP-CM did not stimulate colony formation by isolated T-cells. These observations point to interactions among nasal epithelial growth and differentiation factors, blood-borne progenitors and T-cells in the local accumulation of basophils, mast cells, and eosinophils in nasal polyps.\r"

The amount of IL-1 produced by AM (BAL IL-1) was significantly increased in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis compared with that in 18 control subjects. BAL IL-1 showed a significant positive correlation with the intensity of alveolitis assessed by the proportion of lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the absolute number of lymphocytes per milliliter of BALF. However, the amount of IL-2 produced by lung T-cells (BALT IL-2) showed a significant negative correlation with the intensity of alveolitis. BALT IL-2 was significantly lower than the amount of IL-2 produced by blood T-cells (PBT IL-2). There was no correlation between PBT IL-2 and the intensity of alveolitis. These results suggest that IL-2 contributes to the formation and maintenance of alveolitis in pulmonary sarcoidosis, whereas IL-2 production by lung T-cells is suppressed to down-regulate the enhanced immune processes at the site of disease. The possibility that this hyporesponsiveness of lung T-cells to PHA has resulted from the modulation of the T3-T cell receptor complex remains to be determined.\r"

However, the soluble factors mediating these effects and the importance of intercytokine interactions in these regulating events remain poorly understood. We analyzed the effect of recombinant (r) interleukin-1-alpha (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and gamma, alpha, and beta 1 interferons (IFN), alone and in combination, on the proliferation of normal human lung fibroblasts. rIL-1 and rTNF weakly stimulated and the rIFNs inhibited fibroblast proliferation. Importantly, when rTNF was combined with rIL-1 or rIFN, synergistic inhibition of fibroblast proliferation was noted. The inhibition caused by rIFN-gamma plus rTNF was largely independent of fibroblast prostaglandin (PG) production because fibroblast PG levels were unaltered in the presence of these cytokines and blocking fibroblast PG production did not alter their inhibitory effect. In contrast, the inhibition caused by rIL-1 plus rTNF appeared to be at least partially mediated by fibroblast PG production because these cytokines acted synergistically to stimulate fibroblast PG production and blocking fibroblast PG production reversed the inhibition that they caused. These studies demonstrate that TNF can interact with IL-1 or IFN to inhibit the proliferation of normal diploid fibroblasts and that the inhibitory effects of these cytokine combinations are mediated by different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Micromolar concentrations of adenosine were found to potentiate the release of histamine and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from immunologically activated human lung mast cells (HLMC). Structurally modified congeners of adenosine including 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) and R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA) also potentiated mediator release. A rank order of potency was established where NECA greater than R-PIA for the potentiation of both LTC4 production and histamine secretion. Mast cells isolated by either enzymatic or mechanical means from human lung parenchyma were both similarly responsive to the modulatory effects of adenosine and analogues, and the potency series of NECA greater than R-PIA also applied. Moreover, histamine release induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 was augmented by NECA, R-PIA, and adenosine and in that potency order. Dipyridamole, an agent thought to impede the intracellular uptake of adenosine, failed to reverse the nucleoside's enhancement of IgE-mediated secretion. The irreversible inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, deoxycoformycin, did not modify the adenosine enhancement of stimulated secretion. Low concentrations of methylxanthines, which antagonize responses mediated at cell surface adenosine receptors, were inconsistent in their effects. Theophylline modestly reversed the adenosine-induced potentiation of IgE-mediated LTC4 generation but not histamine release. Studies employing 8-phenyltheophylline were complicated by the methylxanthine possessing inhibitory properties of its own at concentrations expected to antagonize a nucleoside-mediated effect. In total, these results suggest that the response of HLMC to adenosine describes properties most consistent with an A2/Ra-like process, although an interaction via an, as yet, uncharacterized cell surface receptor cannot be excluded.\r"

  ".W": "To cause emphysema, proteases that are instilled into the air spaces must first be transported across the alveolar epithelium, a barrier that is normally quite impermeable to macromolecules. It was postulated that phospholipase A2 (PLA2) exposure would potentiate porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced epithelial solute permeability in a manner similar to that which was previously shown with lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), a naturally occurring, membrane-perturbing agent that is formed principally through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by PLA2. Groups of hamsters were given intratracheal injections of PLA2 (0.3 units) or one of the expected hydrolytic products of PLA2 in equimolar concentrations, lysoPC (135 micrograms), arachidonic acid (AA) (100 micrograms), or palmitic acid (PA) (70 micrograms) with or without PPE (4 units). Epithelial permeability surface area products (PS) of the alveolar epithelium to [14C]sucrose and 125I-labeled neutral dextran (MW, 70,000) were measured in isolated perfused lungs 30 min after instillation, and emphysema severity was assessed at 3 wk by pressure-volume relationships and by mean linear intercepts. Additionally, the effects of lysoPC, PA, and AA on the functions of PPE and alpha 1-antiprotease (alpha 1 PI) in vitro were evaluated. Sucrose and dextran 70 PS differed significantly from controls only in those groups of hamsters that received PLA2 of lysoPC (p less than 0.05). LysoPC and PLA2 also potentiated the severity of PPE-induced emphysema to a similar degree (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purposes were (1) to evaluate the prevalence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and work-related wheezing, (2) to assess correlations between cobalt exposure and pulmonary disease, (3) to compare lung disease in grinders of hard carbide versus nongrinders, and (4) to evaluate the effects of new and previous threshold limit values for cobalt of 50 and 100 micrograms/m3. We obtained medical and occupational histories, flow-volume loops, single breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and chest radiographs. Time-weighted average cobalt levels were determined at every step in the production process. Work-related wheeze occurred in 113 participants (10.9%). Profusion greater than or equal to 1/0 occurred in 26 (2.6%) and interstitial lung disease (defined as profusion greater than or equal to 1M, FVC or DLCO less than or equal to 70%, and FEV1/FVC% greater than or equal to 75) in 7 (0.7%). The relative odds of work-related wheeze was 2.1 times for present cobalt exposures exceeding 50 micrograms/m3 compared with exposures less than or equal to 50 micrograms/m3. The relative odds of profusion greater than or equal to 1/0 was 5.1 times for average lifetime cobalt exposures exceeding 100 micrograms/m3 compared with exposures less than or equal to 100 micrograms/m3 in those with latency exceeding 10 yr. ILD was found in three workers with very low average lifetime exposures (less than 8 micrograms/m3) and shorter latencies. Grinders of hard carbide had lower mean DLCO than nongrinders, even though their cobalt exposures were lower.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder characterized by the accumulation of activated helper/inducer T-lymphocytes in the lower respiratory tract, a process thought to be central to the pathogenesis of the disease. Because cyclosporine, a fungus-derived cyclic peptide, has specific inhibitory effects on T-lymphocyte activation, it should suppress activated sarcoid lung T-cells, and thus it should theoretically be an ideal therapeutic agent for sarcoidosis. This was confirmed in vitro: the addition of cyclosporine to T-cells recovered from the lungs of patients with active sarcoid suppressed the spontaneous release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and monocyte chemotactic factor by these cells and inhibited their exaggerated spontaneous replication. In contrast, the oral administration of conventional doses (10 mg/kg/day) of cyclosporine to eight of these patients over a 6-month period was not accompanied by suppression of sarcoid lung T-cell activation. On the average, the spontaneous release of IL-2 and monocyte chemotactic factor, the proliferation of lymphocytes, and the number of helper/inducer T-cells present in the lungs of these subjects remained elevated and similar to their pretherapy values. Consistent with this lack of effect on sarcoid lung T-cell activation, no improvement in lung function was observed over the trial period. Thus, although cyclosporine is effective in vitro in suppressing the exaggerated activation of sarcoid lung T-cells, it does not do so in vivo, suggesting this agent will not be useful in the therapy of active pulmonary sarcoidosis, at least when administered in a conventional fashion.\r"

  ".U": "89075446\r", 
  ".W": "Stimulated human blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages are known to elaborate a soluble factor(s) that inhibits fibroblast proliferation by stimulating fibroblast prostaglandin (PG) production. However, the factor(s) mediating these effects has never been completely characterized and its relationship to known cytokines has never been fully defined. In this study, we demonstrate that this factor(s) is partially trypsin-sensitive, is between 16 and 24 kilodaltons molecular weight, and elutes between 0.13 and 0.25 M NaCl and 24 and 38% 1-propanol from anion exchange and reverse phase columns, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have similar patterns of elution and that the fibroblast growth-inhibiting and PGE-stimulating activities in monocyte and alveolar macrophage supernatants are partially reversed with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1-beta or TNF. However, this inhibition is not due to IL-1-beta or TNF, alone, because each has a mild stimulatory effect on fibroblast proliferation. In contrast, a dose-dependent inhibition of fibroblast proliferation is noted when fibroblasts are simultaneously exposed to recombinant IL-1 and TNF. This inhibition is reversed when fibroblast PG production is blocked and appears to result from IL-1 and TNF synergistically stimulating fibroblast PGE production. Thus, the PG-mediated inhibition of fibroblast proliferation caused by stimulated human mononuclear phagocytes is not the result of a single cytokine but is instead at least partly mediated by an interaction of IL-1 and TNF.\r"

In another series of guinea pigs, simple opening of the lateral semicircular canal and covering it with a pledget of Gelfoam soaked with gentamicin was an excellent method for producing a selective vestibular lesion. It is expected to reduce the function of all vestibular sense organs without impairing cochlear function.\r"

Endothelium-dependent relaxations and aortic vascular architecture were studied in Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed 8% NaCl, 0.1% NaCl, or 8% NaCl plus 3.6% potassium citrate for 8 weeks. Rats fed 8% NaCl or 8% NaCl plus 3.6% potassium citrate became hypertensive, while those fed 0.1% NaCl did not. Aortic rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution (37 degrees C) and aerated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. In rings contracted with norepinephrine, acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-diphosphate caused endothelium-dependent relaxations that were significantly reduced in rats fed 8% NaCl as compared with those fed 0.1% NaCl. Potassium supplementation (8% NaCl/3.6% potassium citrate) significantly enhanced relaxations to acetylcholine in salt-sensitive rats, while those to adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thrombin were either minimally affected or unchanged. Relaxations to sodium nitroprusside were similar in rats with or without potassium supplementation. Hypertension significantly increased aortic medial and intimal thickness. Dietary potassium had no significant effect on the vascular architecture. These results suggest that high potassium diet enhances endothelium-dependent relaxations in Dahl rats at least in part independently of changes in blood pressure. Thus, potassium may be important for its protective effect against stroke and renal damage in this animal model of hypertension.\r"

Since hemodialysis patients show signs of feminization and an increased propensity for atherosclerosis they are particularly suited to probe the relationship between estrogen, testosterone, and atherosclerosis. Therefore, we measured plasma total, free, and protein-bound estradiol (E2), testosterone (Te), and prolactin in 28 hemodialysis patients and in 30 age-matched controls. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels were also assayed. Total and free E2 as well as Te were significantly decreased in the patients (p less than 0.001). However, the E2/Te ratio was elevated in the patients (p = 0.05), as was vWF (p less than 0.01). No correlations were found between hormone levels and vWF, gynecomastia or vascular disease, but vWF and vascular disease were highly correlated. We conclude that in hemodialysis patients absolute estrogen levels are lower than normal, but that the estrogen/androgen ratio is shifted in favor of estrogen because of the coexistence of androgen deficiency. These findings suggest that an elevation in the estrogen/androgen ratio, rather than an increase in estrogen per se, may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "In order to determine if immunohistologic features are useful in distinguishing benign from malignant types of erythroderma, we studied the immunophenotype of lesional T cells in 20 patients (8 mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, 12 benign) and found them to be generally similar. In all cases, the majority of T cells were Leu-1+, Leu-4+, and Leu-5+, as is typical of mature T cells. Although in most cases a majority of Leu-3+ (helper/phenotype) T cells were present, in 2 there was a majority of the Leu-2+ (cytotoxic/suppressor) subset and in 12 others, a significant minority (20%-40%) of these cells. Low percentages of Leu-2+ cells (less than or equal to 10%), resulting in high Leu-3+/Leu-2+ ratios, did not distinguish benign from malignant erythroderma. Leu-8 antigen deficiency was common in both mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome and benign cases (62% vs 75%, respectively). In contrast, Leu-9 antigen deficiency was present in only one patient in each group. The lack of combined Leu-8/9 antigen deficiency in our patients may be due to a heavy inflammatory T cell component, obscuring the antigen deficiencies seen in most nonerythrodermic mycosis fungoides cases. We conclude that immunophenotypic studies with the use of the current antibody panel show many similarities between benign and malignant forms of erythroderma, as well as some minor differences that may prove diagnostically useful if corroborated by future studies.\r"

McN-5652 is characterized by exceptionally high potency as an inhibitor of the uptake of serotonin by rat brain synaptosomes in vitro (Ki approximately 0.6 nM) and ex vivo (ED50 approximately 2 mg/kg p.o.). The high potency of McN-5652 as a serotonin uptake inhibitor in vivo is indicated further by the low doses required to potentiate L-5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches in mice (ED50 = 0.4 mg/kg 2 hr after p.o. dosing) and the serotonin syndrome in rats (ED50 = 1.5 mg/kg 2 hr after p.o. dosing). McN-5652 also potently inhibited the synaptosomal uptake of norepinephrine (Ki approximately 3 nM) and was a moderately potent inhibitor of the synaptosomal uptake of dopamine (Ki approximately 40 nM). McN-5652 inhibited tetrabenazine-induced ptosis in rats and mice but was much less effective in blocking the sedation caused by tetrabenazine. In rats, McN-5652 did not induce the stereotyped behavior often caused by dopamine agonists and inhibitors of dopamine uptake. Receptor binding experiments indicated that McN-5652 has a weak affinity for serotonin 5-HT2 and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (apparent Ki approximately 200 nM) and a very low affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT1, alpha-2 adrenergic, muscarinic and gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptors. Experiments using the guinea pig ileum indicate that McN-5652 is a weak, noncompetitive antagonist of histamine.\r"

  ".W": "Comparative studies on the effects of prostaglandins (PGs) on 1,2-diacylglycerol, measured as phosphatidic acid (PA), and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production, cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation, myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and contraction in the iris sphincter smooth muscle of rabbit, bovine and other mammalian species were undertaken and functional and biochemical relationships between the IP3-Ca++ and cAMP second messenger systems were demonstrated. The findings obtained from these studies can be summarized as follows: 1) all PGs investigated, including PGE2, PGF2 alpha, PGF2 alpha-ester, PGE1 and PGA2 increased IP3 accumulation and PA formation, and the extent of stimulation was dependent on the animal species. Thus, PGF2 alpha-ester (1 microM), the most potent of the PGs, increased IP3 accumulation in rabbit and bovine sphincters by 33 and 58%, respectively, and increased PA formation by 67 and 56%, respectively. The PG increased IP3 accumulation in both rabbit and bovine sphincters very rapidly (T1/2 values about 26 sec) and in a dose-dependent manner. 2) The PG had no effect on MLC phosphorylation in the rabbit sphincter, but it increased that of the bovine by 36%. 3) The PG increased cAMP formation by 75% in the rabbit sphincter but it had no effect on that of the bovine. 4) The PG induced a maximal contractile response in the bovine sphincter but it had no effect on that of the rabbit. 5) In the bovine, PGA2 induced IP3 accumulation and contraction, without an effect on cAMP formation; however, in the rabbit, cat and dog it increased cAMP formation and had no effect on IP3 accumulation and contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Here, the time course of CRFs actions against heat-induced swelling was investigated. The paws of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were immersed in 58 degrees C water for 30 sec and the resultant swelling was measured by the fluid displacement method. Human/rat CRF, 28 micrograms/kg s.c., injected 0.5 to 2 hr before heat exposure reduced swelling by over 50%. Pretreatment at 4 hr before heat was also effective, but not at 12 or 24 hr. CRF, injected 28 micrograms/kg i.v. 0, 10 or 20 min after heat exposure, inhibited the progressive development of swelling immediately. Histological examination of skin showed that CRF, given before or after heat, reduced vesication, edema, epidermal necrosis and the disruption of tissue architecture produced by thermal injury. The alpha-helical CRF(9-41) antagonist administered alone, 92 micrograms/kg i.v., before or after heat did not affect heat injury. The antagonist, however, both prevented and reversed the inhibitory effects of CRF on the swelling produced by heat. The antagonist-induced reversal occurred as late as 2 hr after CRF, 28 micrograms/kg s.c. Overall, these results suggested that CRF is a potent and efficacious agent in protecting skin against experimental thermal injury.\r"

The clinically effective single doses of the drugs were better correlated with the effective doses on local hyperthermia than with those on carrageenin paw edema, or with the inhibitory activities of the drugs on prostaglandin E2 generation from cultured rat synovial cells. Although care should be taken to avoid false-positive anti-inflammatory effects arising from vasoconstrictor activity or toxicity, determination of lowering effects on local hyperthermia in this inflammatory model may be useful for the evaluation of anti-inflammatory compounds.\r"

With the exception of interferon-gamma, the effects of the cytokines were generally elevated by indomethacin, suggesting inhibition of the DNA synthesis by an endogenously produced cyclooxygenase product(s). Consistent with this suggestion, exogenous prostaglandin E2 suppressed cytokine induced DNA synthesis. All of the cytokines studied might play a role in the synovial hyperplasia present in rheumatoid disease.\r"

Information was obtained from 1,610 raccoons submitted for rabies testing in four of the affected mid-Atlantic states during 1982 and 1983 and from 798 raccoons from Virginia during 1984 and 1985. Analysis of the two sets of data provided an opportunity to characterize certain aspects of the epizootic. Raccoons collected during the day or at dusk and those that behaved abnormally were more likely to be rabid. Many human exposures to raccoons were preventable or may not have necessitated treatment. Eight (3%) of 291 serum samples from raccoons in an epizootic area had titers of antibody to rabies virus (complete neutralization) of greater than or equal to 1:25. Field trials of baiting systems incorporating an oral raccoon rabies vaccine are being conducted in Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.\r"

To test this hypothesis, the authors reviewed 15 patients with low-back pain and compared the results of the radiographs, planar bone scans (PBS), and SPECT. Four of 15 had normal examinations with all three methods of imaging. The rest had a positive test in at least one of the three methods. Single photon emission computed tomography was positive in eleven, PBS in six, and the radiograph in three of the 11 patients. It appears that the SPECT was the most sensitive method of imaging and greatly enhanced our diagnostic acumen for stress fractures or stress reactions of the spine.\r"

AF cells could maintain their differentiated phenotype well in our primary culturing condition. In this situation, IL-1 alpha stimulated the cells and induced marked increase of PG release. Dose dependency of IL-1 alpha on PG release was seen in the concentration range between 5-50 U/ml. Caseinolytic activity produced and secreted into the medium by AF cells was assayed and it was found that IL-1 alpha enhanced the enzyme activities in the medium. The effects of IL-1 alpha on PG and DNA synthesis were also studied. Slight depression was observed in PG synthesis but there was no effect on DNA synthesis. These data suggest that IL-1 alpha may play an important role in PG metabolism of intervertebral disc cells, especially in the catabolic pathway of PG.\r"

They all walked in a forward bending posture, either all the time or only when exhausted. In roentgenograms, most cases showed a marked loss of the sacral inclination, as well as multiple disc narrowing and/or vertebral wedging in the lumbar region. These subjects showed a definite weakness of the lumbar extensors compared to the flexors, and therefore a reversed ratio of extensors/flexors muscle power compared with normal controls and other types of spinal curvatures. Weakness of the lumbar extensors was clearly shown by isokinetic measurement and a marked atrophy of these muscles with fatty infiltration was demonstrated by CT scanning.\r"

Anaemia of unknown cause was rare, but somewhat more common at age 81. Mean blood haemoglobin concentrations in subsamples without definable disorders were significantly lower at age 81 than at ages 70 and 75, whereas the lower health-related reference limits did not differ significantly. White blood cell counts tended to be lower and iron deficiency was somewhat more common at age 81. No significant differences were found in platelet counts or in the prevalence of low plasma cobalamin concentrations. These results indicate a fall in blood haemoglobin with advancing age. The arbitrary WHO criteria for anaemia are clinically applicable at age 70-81.\r"

Specifically, the principal neutralizing site within HIV-1, the major envelope glycoprotein gp120, failed to elicit detectable cellular reactivities. The carboxyl portion of gp120 and the transmembrane gp41 region were uniformly recognized by patient antibodies but did not produce significant lymphocyte blastogenesis. However, the amino half of gp120 elicited cellular responses in a majority of the immunocompetent individuals tested, despite its extremely low reactivity with patient sera.

Lymphocyte function was determined by measuring streptolysin O (SLO)-induced proliferative responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and of PBL depleted of CD8 lymphocytes. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) induced interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was also measured. In all functional tests values were significantly lower in HIV antibody-positive subjects than in HIV antibody-negative subjects. Results lower than the 95% confidence limit in HIV antibody-negative individuals were therefore defined as \"decreased.\" Decreased functional responses were most frequent (83-100%) in individuals with a number of CD4 lymphocytes of less than 400/microliters, and were least frequent (3-21%) in subjects with a CD4 lymphocyte count of greater than 600/microliters. Frequency of decreased functional responses was intermediate in the population with 600-400/microliters CD4 lymphocytes. The magnitude of functional responses differed significantly between groups with less than 400, 400-600, and greater than 600 CD4 lymphocytes per microliter, indicating that T helper cell number decreases with loss of immune function.\r"

Twenty-five patients had postoperative barium meal examination. The varices were ameliorated in 19, not changed in 5 and exacerbated in 1. Nine patients rebled and of these, two died. The stapler is used in devascularization to interrupt intramural varices in the oesophagocardiac region. It must be emphasized that its use is only a part of the devascularization procedure.

Once animals were overtrained on this task, they were given intravenous injections of N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (0.15 to 0.33 mg/kg). Animals were tested daily for performance in the previously learned behavioural task and were assessed daily for abnormalities in motor functioning. Monkeys developed deficits in operant task performance characterized by termination of responses after an initial series of responses and long pauses between responses. Once an animal stopped responding to the task, responses could often be reinitiated if the experimenter guided the monkey through the task. This type of performance deficit was seen both before and without the appearance of distinct parkinsonian motor signs. Animals which developed motor signs had extensive ventral mesencephalic cell loss while an animal with performance deficits but without motor signs had cell loss restricted to the ventral substantia nigra pars compacta. The results demonstrate that operant performance deficits can be observed in MPTP-treated monkeys independent of the appearance of motor deficits.\r"

Inhibitory activity to interleukin-1 was seen in both normal and patient monocyte supernatants. 3. Inhibitory activity was significantly higher in unstimulated and stimulated monocyte supernatants from systemic sclerosis patients. 4. The net effect was an apparent decrease in lymphocyte-activating factor activity in the monocyte supernatants from systemic sclerosis patients. 5. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which collagen deposition could be enhanced, thereby giving rise to the extensive fibrosis characteristic of systemic sclerosis.\r"

Pre-operatively unstable angina (61.6%) and congestive heart failure (10.9%) were significant presenting features. Triple vessel disease accounted for 61.6% of cases while 26% had left main coronary obstruction. The mean number of grafts per patient was 3.2 +/- 0.9. Combined procedures such as valve replacement were done in 16.2% of patients. The hospital mortality rate was 2.7% and there was not a single recordable case of peri-operative myocardial infarction. Significant complications post-operatively were atrial arrhythmias (43.8%), segmental pulmonary atelectasis (43.8%) and renal problems (15%). Of the sixty patients followed up at an average of 27.7 months, 58 were in NYHA Functional Class I. Good patient selection and careful monitoring leads to encouraging results with coronary artery bypass grafting in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "2,784 patients had a primary coronary artery reconstruction, between 1977 and 1987. From 1984, one internal mammary artery (IMA) and later both IMAs were used as the grafts of choice, supplemented where necessary with a saphenous vein graft (SVG). As a result, 1,681 patients had SVG, 726 had a single internal mammary artery graft (SIMA), while 377 patients had a bilateral internal mammary artery reconstruction (BIMA). Comparison of the pre-operative data showed that patients who had a SIMA were similar to those who had a SVG except that they were older, had a more stable presentation and they had a higher incidence of myocardial infarction. Patients who had a BIMA reconstruction were younger, more frequently male, presented with more stable symptoms, and had better left ventricular function than patients who had a SVG alone. Despite these favourable findings, the incidence of peri-operative myocardial infarction was higher in the BIMA group, compared with the SVG group. The change from SVG grafting to SIMA grafting was also associated with a higher incidence of post-operative bleeding. The surgical mortality was similar in all 3 groups. These findings suggest that the change to IMA grafting is associated with a slightly increased morbidity and perhaps this operation should be performed on selected patients rather than used routinely.\r"

Brain blood flow was normal before and after operation in 3 patients whose autoregulation was kept intact. Seven patients received acetazolamide to limit cerebral vascular reactivity and in four of these, preoperative perfusion defects were visible. After carotid endarterectomy the ipsilateral perfusion defects were abolished and it is concluded that carotid stenosis can reduce perfusion in the dysautoregulation brain and that carotid reconstruction can restore normal flow.\r"

Preliminary otoscopy revealed tympanic membrane appearances consistent with middle ear effusion in a correspondingly low proportion of ears (7.6 per cent), whilst acoustic reflex screening at 105 dB for three frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2 kHz) showed absent reflexes at one or more frequencies in 8.1 per cent of the ears.

Low initial FEV1 value was significantly associated with increased mortality (p less than 0.005). A 3 yr mortality rate of 40% was found in individuals whose initial FEV1 values were less than 30% of that predicted. In contrast, the corresponding 3-yr mortality among those whose initial FEV1 values were between 30 and 65% of that predicted was only 7%. Smokers were found to have significantly lower FEV1 levels (p = 0.008) and higher mortality (p less than 0.005) than non-smokers. The difference between current and ex-smokers in mortality and FEV1 level were not statistically significant (p = 0.9 and p greater than 0.25, respectively). Cross-sectional analysis of the initial FEV1 values indicated a significant decline (p less than 0.005) of FEV1 with increasing age. This decline was greater among smokers than non-smokers. Longitudinal analysis of FEV1 rates of decline in 80 cases with follow-up FEV1 measurements failed to detect any significant differences between smokers and non-smokers, but was performed late in the disease process. The application of these results to the planning of studies on replacement therapy, smoking intervention strategy and longitudinal follow-up is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "We compared our standard method of data presentation in the operating room (i.e., using \"front end\" equipment) with a newly developed, computerized monitoring system called the data acquisition and display system. These two systems differed in that data presentation using the standard front-end equipment was scattered and poorly structured, whereas data obtained from the newly developed system were unified and integrated. To effect the comparison, we examined the \"controllability\" (i.e., the precision of control) by the anesthesiologist of hemodynamic variables: arterial systolic, mean, and diastolic pressures, mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean central venous pressure, and heart rate. Controllability was assumed to be an indictor of the quality of anesthesia. All perioperative data were stored every 15 seconds on a floppy disk, and these data were available for analysis. The controllability was quantified by calculating the surface area of the signal of a variable outside a defined control zone; the smaller this surface area, the greater the controllability. A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistical test was done to test whether the two different data presentation systems would result in different levels of controllability (the first zero hypothesis). A Kruskal-Wallis test was done to examine the \"inter-anesthesiologist variability\" between the two systems (the second zero hypothesis). Our data showed great variability. Looking for factors that might explain this, we found that if preoperative systolic blood pressure was greater than 160 mm Hg and diastolic pressure was greater than 95 mm Hg, hemodynamic variables fluctuated more widely. We could show no differences in controllability when the two systems were compared overall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ventricular electrodes detected recurring electrical activity in 7 of 18 patients. Three of these 7 patients did not have simultaneous standard ECG activity, indicating that, in the usual monitoring circumstances, this ventricular electrical activity would not have been treated with repeat cardioplegia.

Setup and calibration of the instrument typically required 20 minutes. During bypass, 129 blood samples were drawn from 16 patients for comparison with conventional measurements obtained with a blood gas machine. Data for each variable, within each sensor, were analyzed by linear regression. The ranges of the standard errors of the estimate were 0.7 to 4.2 mm Hg for PCO2, 18.3 to 78.7 mm Hg for the high PO2 range, 1.4 to 7.1 mm Hg for the low PO2 range, and 0.008 to 0.049 for pH. The regression lines differed from the identity line (P less than 0.05) in at least one variable in most patients, and large deviations from the line of identity in both slope and intercept were common. Among 58 sensors evaluated, failures occurred in 5 (2.9%) of the 174 optodes, and minor leakage occurred in 2 (3.4%) of the flow-through cells. We conclude that although this flow-through fluorometric instrument is an adequate monitor of trends in blood gases during cardiopulmonary bypass, it is not accurate enough to supplant conventional laboratory measurements.\r"

Pregnant rats were fed diets containing 1, 5, 30 or 180 mg Zn/kg diet in an equalized regime from d 13-20 of gestation. Metallothionein gene expression was examined by Northern blot and dot blot hybridization using combined 60-mer oligonucleotides specific for rat metallothionein-1 and -2 genes. Expression was progressively depressed in the fetal livers and livers and kidneys of dams fed diets marginal (5 mg/kg) and deficient (1 mg/kg) in zinc content. Administration of rhIL-1 alpha increased expression in maternal liver, placenta and in fetal liver of dams fed adequate or deficient diets. Kinetics of intravenously administered 65Zn showed that in response to rhIL-1 alpha, there was a higher uptake by the maternal liver and bone marrow with less 65Zn uptake by bone, intestine and plasma activity compared to controls. No change was observed in 65Zn taken up by the placenta or transferred to the fetus. Alteration of metallothionein gene expression could represent, in part, the mechanism whereby altered effects of zinc metabolism and function are mediated during fetal development.\r"

This could be because smoking reduces the likelihood of developing sarcoidosis, or alternatively smoking could reduce the severity of the disease process so that smoking patients are underrepresented among patients with clinically overt disease. To evaluate these possibilities 64 patients with sarcoidosis of recent onset were studied at presentation and after a one year follow up period, clinical, functional, radiographic, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid criteria being used to identify factors that might account for the lower incidence of sarcoidosis in smokers and to determine whether the disease is less severe in smoking patients. Smoking was less common in the patients with sarcoidosis (30%) than in the control subjects (46%). The study did not support the conclusion that sarcoidosis is less severe in smokers, as clinical, radiographic, and functional abnormalities were similar in smokers and non-smokers at initial evaluation and after a one year follow up period. Nevertheless, smoking did influence various indices used to assess disease \"activity.\" Cigarette smoking was associated with a significant increase in the serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity (SACE), and patients with very high SACE and pulmonary gallium-67 uptake were smokers. Furthermore, more CD8+ (but not CD4+) lymphocytes were recovered by lavage from smoking than from non-smoking patients, giving a lower CD4: CD8 ratio in smokers. Fewer alveolar macrophages were recovered by lavage from smokers with sarcoidosis than from normal subjects with a similar smoking history. These finding support the possibility that smokers, particularly those with a prominent accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the lower respiratory tract, may be less likely to develop sarcoidosis.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical observations and experimental studies have pointed to a role for leukocytes in the pathogenesis of the typical or epidemic form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. As a result of these observations we measured serum elastase levels and the levels of two protease inhibitors, alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin in 12 patients with this syndrome. The serum elastase levels were significantly elevated in patients compared with normal individuals (421 +/- 278 vs 91 +/- 27 mg/dl, p less than 0.005) and patients with renal diseases not caused by hemolytic uremic syndrome (191 +/- 254 mg/dl, p less than 0.025). The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin levels were also significantly elevated: hemolytic uremic syndrome vs normals (774 +/- 260 vs 285 +/- 98 ng/ml, p less than 0.0001); and in hemolytic syndrome compared with patients with renal diseases not caused by hemolytic uremic syndrome (774 +/- 260 vs 335 +/- 131 ng/ml, p less than 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the alpha-2-macroglobulin levels among the three groups. There was a significant correlation between the serum elastase levels and the total white cell counts as well as between the elastase and the polymorphonuclear cell counts but not among any of these values and the serum creatinine concentrations. These results provide additional evidence favoring the possibility that leukocytes are activated in patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the distinguishing features of pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), we compared three groups of patients, 16 with endobronchial KS, 15 with endobronchial KS and an opportunistic lung infection, and 40 with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) without concomitant pulmonary KS. The majority of pulmonary KS patients had extensive cutaneous disease at the time of pulmonary diagnosis, and the diagnosis of pulmonary KS was easily established by the characteristic appearance of the endobronchial lesions. Dyspnea, fever, and cough were common presenting symptoms, but occurred more commonly in association with accompanying opportunistic infection. Diffuse interstitial infiltrates were observed in most patients in both groups, but the findings of nodular parenchymal densities or pleural effusion were more commonly observed in patients with pulmonary KS than in those with PCP alone. Pulmonary uptake of gallium-67 citrate or a diffusing capacity less than 80% were unusual in patients with pulmonary KS alone, but common in those with accompanying opportunistic infection or with PCP alone. Median survival in patients with pulmonary KS was only 2 months, and most patients had complicating opportunistic infections at the time of death. Pulmonary KS is generally a late and often preterminal manifestation of AIDS. Chest radiographs, gallium lung scans, and pulmonary function testing may provide diagnostic information that is helpful in distinguishing pulmonary KS from opportunistic lung infections.\r"

  ".W": "In order to improve understanding of how HIV-1 infection down-modulates cell surface membrane expression of CD4, we have measured several parameters of CD4 expression in the human tumor T-cell lines CEM and MOLT-4 at different times after infection. Three independent HIV-1 isolates were used including one that encodes a truncated nef protein and another that appeared to be noncytolytic against CEM. The level of CD4 mRNA, the rate of biosynthesis of CD4 protein, and the percentage of CD4-positive cells were measured. With each viral isolate it was found that infection led to a specific and almost complete inhibition of CD4 protein biosynthesis. This substantially exceeded, at every time point after infection, a concomitant reduction in CD4 mRNA. Hence an inhibition of translation probably accounts for much of the decline in the rate of CD4 biosynthesis. This implicates a novel selective translational inhibition of host gene expression by HIV-1 as a factor in the disappearance of surface membrane CD4 from infected cultures.\r"

  ".W": "This article initially discusses the types of responses elicited by infectious agents, such as viruses and the role of each response in preventing, limiting, and clearing the infection. An important response is the generation of immunological memory, in both the B and T cell compartments. Generally, attenuated viral vaccines have been highly successful at inducing long-lived immunity but our understanding of the reasons for this comes from the study of model systems, such as murine influenza virus infections. Specific antibody may largely prevent infection and specific cytotoxic T cells and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxic reactions are the main mechanisms for clearing viral infections. Recent evidence shows that for some months after infection by HIV, a strong cytotoxic T (Tc) cell response occurs in infected, asymptomatic individuals; these cells are continuously generated by HIV-infected stimulator cells that most likely also serve as target cells in vivo. A low level of specific antibody is also formed and a number of reasons are listed to explain why HIV escapes antibody-mediated neutralization and infects cells expressing CD4 receptors. Cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage are also infected and these express Fc and complement receptors; there is the strong possibility that infection of these cells occurred following the formation of complexes of infectious HIV with antibody to the surface antigen and attachment of complement components. The continuous presence of activated Tc cells that, in contrast to many other viral diseases, does not clear the infection strongly suggests that foci of infected cells sequestered from or resistant to immune control become established. These secrete virus that infects other (stimulator) cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
