This study was designed to test the protective potential of low-dose ethanol against acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) -induced gastric injury. Ten healthy volunteers who were nondrinkers and had normal baseline upper gastrointestinal endoscopy participated in a randomized double-blind crossover study. Thirty minutes after either vodka (37.5 ml) in tomato juice or tomato juice alone, each subject took 975 mg ASA and then underwent endoscopy 1 hr later. The degree of mucosal injury was scored, and blood was taken for ethanol and salicylate levels. There was a washout interval of seven days between the two treatments. Endoscopic scores were analyzed using the sign test. After a single dose of ASA, mucosal injury was confined to the fundus and antrum, while the duodenum was minimally affected. A significant reduction in antral damage was seen with ethanol pretreatment (P less than 0.05). The same trend was evident in the fundus but did not achieve statistical significance. Serum salicylate levels averaged 13.2 +/- 0.8 mg/100 ml and were not different between the two treatments. Ethanol concentration ranged from 1.1 to 6.2 mmol/liter following the vodka drink and was 0 after the placebo.\r"

Fifteen subjects with moderate to severe reflux symptoms were studied in each position on consecutive nights using continuous intraesophageal pH monitoring. We found no difference in reflux frequency among the positions. The wedge caused a statistically significant decrease in the time that distal esophageal pH was less than 4 as compared to the flat position. The wedge also decreased the longest episode experienced by the subjects. Elevation on blocks caused a similar improvement in parameters but failed in this study to achieve statistical significance. Both elevation by a wedge and on blocks showed a trend towards a decrease in clearance time as compared to the flat position. The patients did not always prefer elevation on a wedge, but for some it is a valuable alternative to elevation by bed blocks.\r"

The study was repeated four times in each subject. By a glucose-insulin clamp technique blood glucose levels were kept constant during the studies at 5.0 mmol/liter (euglycemic clamp), 2.5 mmol/liter (hypoglycemic clamp), or 7.0 mmol/liter (hyperglycemic clamp) on three different days. Glucose and insulin were not infused during one control day study. During glucagon infusion, plasma glucagon levels increased but the level reached was lower during the hyperglycemic condition when compared to euglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions. Glucagon infusion inhibited gastric acid secretion during hyper- and euglycemic conditions but not during hypoglycemic conditions. Hyperglycemia caused a modest but significant inhibition of acid secretion. Serum gastric concentrations were unaltered during glucagon infusion regardless of the level of blood glucose. The present observations indicate that the inhibitory effect of glucagon is independent of the glucagon-induced hyperglycemia, but the effect is lost when blood glucose is below a certain limit, suggesting that blood glucose may have a modulating effect on gastric acid secretion.\r"

Baboons were allocated to each of the following six groups: control, gastric acid stimulation with histamine 40 micrograms/kg/hr intravenous, inhibition of basal or stimulated acid secretion with either ranitidine 50 mg intravenous or omeprazole 1 microgram/kg/hr. There were no significant cardiovascular alterations during the experiments. Histamine stimulation produced a concomitant rise in acid secretion and increase in blood flow only to the mucosal layer of the parietal-cell-bearing area of the stomach. Neither the underlying muscle layer nor the non-parietal-cell-bearing fundic or antral mucosa took part in this response, suggesting that a mechanism controlling blood flow is present in close proximity to the parietal cells. It was also established that the increase in blood flow occurs in response to parietal cell activity and not as a result of the action of histamine on the vascular system. Suppression of both basal and stimulated acid secretion did not cause a fall of mucosal blood flow below basal levels in any part of the stomach, indicating that drugs that inhibit parietal cell activity can be used in conditions where gastric mucosal ischemia should be avoided.\r"

Using a nitrogen hydraulic infusion system, recording was performed continuously during 4 hr of fasting and 5 hr of 100 ml/hr infusion of fat (Intralipid 10%) given either intraduodenally (group ID) or intravenously (group IV) and 9 hr after the end of fat administration successively. The two experiments were performed at seven-day intervals in random order. In six of the nine subjects, a third experiment, in which 20 g of cholestyramine was given by mouth during intraduodenal fat infusion (group ID + C), was carried out. Venous blood samples were drawn for measurement of serum triglyceride levels and radioimmunoassay of plasma cholecystokinin. Intraduodenal fat, alone or plus cholestyramine, induced a significant reduction in incidence of phase III of the migrating motor complex. Intravenous fat reduced the incidence of phase III. However, this reduction was significant only during the last 3 hr of fat infusion, corresponding to the highest serum triglyceride concentration. In the three groups, fat infusion induced a significant increase in duration of phase II, leading to a postprandial-like pattern. Plasma cholecystokinin increased significantly in the three groups during fat administration, with a significant positive correlation between serum triglyceride concentration and plasma cholecystokinin in the group IV. The data suggest that, in addition to its known inhibitory effects on activity fronts when acting luminally, fat given intravenously may inhibit phase III activity. The effects in both instances may be mediated in part by cholecystokinin.\r"

In 183 of the 200 patients (91.5%), the ERCP diagnosis and the pathological diagnosis were identical. We then performed an analysis using 52 ERCP criteria. In 192 of the 200 patients (96.0%), the ERCP diagnosis based on this reanalysis and the pathological diagnosis were identical. By discriminant analysis, 13 ERCP criteria with a maximal discriminatory value were selected in patients in whom all diagnostic structures (bile ducts, pancreatic duct, and duodenum) were visible. Using these 13 criteria selected by discriminant analysis, the diagnostic score was 98.9%. A computer program based on these 13 ERCP criteria was designed for use in practice. The diagnostic accuracy of this computer program was 98.4%. Finally we tested this computer program on 171 new patients who were seen in the period 1983-1986. In 143 of the 171 patients, a valid pathological diagnosis was available (83.6%). Comparing the ERCP diagnosis in all patients (even if not all structures were visible) with a valid pathological diagnosis, the prospective score of the computer program was 91.6%. Using this program it was possible to evaluate examinations in which not all structures were visible. When the ERCP diagnosis was uncertain, the doubt could be quantified.\r"

In light of newly developed percutaneous and endoscopic approaches to diagnosis and therapy, we reviewed our experience with 35 cases of cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed and treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1979 to 1984. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTCA) was performed in 34 cases of which only four were resectable. All 22 patients who had preoperative cholangiograms suggesting unresectability had confirmation of this at surgery. Surgical palliation was accomplished with a combination of internal and percutaneous drainage in most cases. Angiographic, cytologic, and laboratory data are presented. PTCA accurately predicted unresectability of cholangiocarcinoma and is superior to angiography in this respect. In patients with cholangiocarcinoma, percutaneous and endoscopic approaches offer alternatives to surgery for diagnosis and palliation.\r"

In addition, the effect of intravenous ethanol on exocrine pancreatic secretion was investigated. With a background infusion of secretin, ethanol (1.3 g/kg body wt) was infused intravenously over a 40-min period. Ethanol infusion significantly increased blood flow in the common hepatic artery (by 49%, at the time of the cessation of ethanol infusion), and this increased flow was maintained for 60 min after the cessation of ethanol infusion. In contrast, blood flow in the portal vein was not altered significantly by ethanol. Pancreatic blood flow and secretion showed no significant difference from those seen in the controls. Our data suggest that intravenous ethanol induces a redistribution of the splanchnic blood flow. The increased hepatic arterial flow seen in response to ethanol may play an important role in preventing ethanol-induced hypoxic liver damage.\r"

Animal studies suggest an inhibitory role for opioids in the control of pancreatic secretion, which may be exerted through their inhibitory effect on acetylcholine release from intramural neurons. We studied pancreatic secretion in six healthy male volunteers (mean age 42 years) by means of duodenal aspiration using PEG-4000 as a recovery marker. Pancreatic secretion was stimulated with duodenal perfusion of mannitol (510 mosmol/kg) and an equimolar solution (0.3 M/liter) of L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan and also with an intravenous bolus of secretin and cholecystokinin (each 1 CU/kg). Each subject underwent six studies on separate days with intravenous infusion of saline, naloxone 40 micrograms/kg/hr, morphine sulfate 40 micrograms/kg/hr, morphine and naloxone combined, naloxone and atropine 13 micrograms/kg/hr, and morphine and bethanechol 16 micrograms/kg/hr. Naloxone caused a significant increase in amylase outputs during the basal period and in response to all stimuli, without affecting bicarbonate outputs. This effect was blocked by atropine. Morphine caused significant reductions in both amylase and bicarbonate outputs with all stimuli. This was accompanied by a reduction in amylase concentrations but not in those of bicarbonate. Bethanechol counteracted these effects of morphine. The combination of morphine and naloxone had no significant effect on pancreatic secretion. Changes in pancreatic polypeptide levels did not explain the observations. In conclusion, these studies suggest that endogenous opioids exert a modulating influence on human pancreatic secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The test was positive (H+) in 98 subjects (7.9%). Endoscopy was subsequently performed on 86% of the H+ and on 64% of the H- subjects.

Of 699 subjects free of neoplastic lesions at endoscopy, 47 had been H+, ie, false positive (6.7%; 95% CI, 5.0-8.7%). Adjusting for differential compliance of H+ and H- subjects to endoscopy, a corrected estimate for sensitivity would be 69% for cancer and 19% for adenomas; the corrected estimate for the false-positive rate would be 5%.\r"

In order to test this hypothesis, 40 subjects were sequentially put in conditions of vigilance, rest, stress, and feeding while colonic motility was monitored. The myoelectric spiking activity of the left colon was recorded with a 50-cm-long silastic tube equipped with four bipolar ring electrodes (located 10 cm apart) introduced into the left colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy. Tracings were performed while the subjects were kept awake (by conversation) for 1 hr, put at rest (quiet) for another 1 hr, submitted to a stress (by alternatively immersing and removing one hand from 2-4 degrees C cold water) for 20 min, and finally recorded for 2 hr after a 800-kcal meal. In 18 other subjects, the sequences of vigilance and rest were randomized. The results showed that colonic spiking activity was made of sporadic bursts that are known to be associated with intraluminal propulsion and of stationary bursts that probably play no role in colonic peristalsis. The duration of sporadic spiking activity was respectively 13.6 +/- 1.2 min/hr (mean +/- SEM) during the period of vigilance, 5.4 +/- 0.6 min/hr during the period of rest (P less than 0.001), 14.3 +/- 1.0 min/hr during the period of stress (NS), and 16.8 +/- 1.2 min/hr after a meal (P less than 0.05).

In five cases immunohistochemical studies were also performed. The clinical findings and course of the disease were similar to other reported series. Laparoscopic findings of mesothelioma were indistinguishable from metastatic peritoneal neoplasms. However, the presence of homogeneous spreading of nodules, plaques, or fleshy masses on both parietal and visceral peritoneum; the absence of direct or indirect signs of other abdominal neoplasms; and the absence of hepatic metastases or the possible presence of nodules or plaques on Glisson's capsule without any parenchymal involvement, when observed, allowed the laparoscopist to suspect the disease in four of 10 cases. Laparoscopy may be useful in detecting mesothelioma. The diagnosis is mainly morphological, but even morphology has its inherent limitations. Further studies are necessary to improve the diagnostic accuracy of this tumor.\r"

  ".U": "88195931\r", 
  ".W": "The guinea pig adrenal cortex can be separated into two zones with contrasting lipid contents: a lipid-rich outer cortex and a lipid-poor inner cortex. Cytoplasmic lipid droplets contain cholesterol esters and are thought to act as a reservoir for steroid precursor. Such lipid droplets are numerous in the outer cortex, but accumulate in the inner region only after treatment with ACTH. Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) esterifies cholesterol to fatty acids for storage in this pool, while cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH) cleaves these esters, increasing free cholesterol. However, the relationship between intracellular cholesterol content and the activity of these enzymes is not clear. In this study we examine the capacity to esterify cholesterol (ACAT) and to hydrolyze cholesterol esters (CEH) in the lipid-rich and lipid-poor regions of the guinea pig adrenal in control animals and animals treated with ACTH or dexamethasone (DEX). For all conditions, the lipid-filled outer cortex possessed more ACAT and CEH activity than did the inner. Although ACAT and CEH in the outer cortex were relatively insensitive to ACTH compared to the enzymes in the inner zone, they were significantly suppressed after DEX treatment. This implies that in the basal state, ACAT and CEH may be almost maximally stimulated in the outer cortex, and that in these cells, cholesterol esterification and hydrolysis may occur at a high rate even in the basal state. The inner cortex responded to ACTH with increased ACAT activity, but was little affected by DEX. In the inner zone, CEH activity was not affected by ACTH or DEX. The lower level of these enzymes in the inner cortex correlates with the paucity of lipid droplets in these cells in the basal state, while the increase in ACAT, but not CEH, in this zone after ACTH treatment correlates with the accumulation of small lipid droplets in inner cortical cells of ACTH-treated animals.\r"

  ".W": "Mammalian uteri contain both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism. Sulfidopeptidyl leukotrienes formed by the lipoxygenase pathway can stimulate uterine contractions and play a role in uterine preparation for implantation. These actions of leukotrienes are perhaps mediated by binding to specific receptors. To understand the cellular basis of leukotriene C4 action, the present quantitative light microscopic autoradiographic study was undertaken on nonpregnant bovine uterine tissue. The results demonstrated that the circular and elongated myometrial smooth muscle, uterine vascular smooth muscle, stromal cells of endometrium, and fibroblasts of perimetrium, but not the endometrial glands, vascular endothelium, and erythrocytes in lumen of arterioles, contained specific silver grains after incubation with [3H]leukotriene C4. The number of grains per 100-micron2 areas were similar in circular and elongated myometrial smooth muscle (P greater than 0.05), which was higher than in other uterine cells (P less than 0.05-0.01). The grains in all cells were greatly reduced after coincubation with excess unlabeled leukotriene C4, but not with leukotriene A4, leukotriene B4, leukotriene D4, leukotriene E4, prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, or prostacyclin. In conclusion, leukotriene C4 may regulate both uterine cells and uterine vasculature and exert contractile and noncontractile actions via the specific leukotriene C4-binding sites present in different cell types.\r"

Gilts were bred on the second observed estrus or were hysterectomized between 6-8 days after estrus (estrus = day 0) and were assigned randomly to one of three treatment groups; saline-treated control, im injections of pLH, and iv injections of pPRL from days 110-120. In control, pLH-treated, and pPRL-treated animals, average gestation lengths were 114 +/- 0.8, 116 +/- 1.9, and 115 +/- 0.5 days (+/- SE), respectively. The relaxin level in mated gilts on day 100 was less than 2 ng/ml; it began to increase after day 110 and peaked in control animals on day 113 (66 ng/ml), whereas in pLH- and pPRL-treated animals, prepartum peak values were greater (P less than 0.01) and occurred on days 113 (104 ng/ml) and 114 (117 ng/ml), respectively. Relaxin dropped to basal levels (less than 1 ng/ml) by day 115 in controls and by day 116 in both pLH- and pPRL-treated gilts. Although pLH and pPRL treatments markedly accentuated peak relaxin secretion, they did not significantly accelerate or delay parturition or delay the abrupt demise of the corpora lutea immediately postpartum. In hysterectomized gilts, relaxin began to increase after day 110, peaked in control animals on day 113 (27 ng/ml), and decreased abruptly thereafter to less than 4 ng/ml. In contrast, pLH caused an immediate release of relaxin on day 111 (23 ng/ml) and sustained elevated levels (P less than 0.01) of relaxin until day 118, but the original corpora lutea regressed. Relaxin in pPRL-treated animals increased steadily after day 110, reaching peak values by day 115 (29 ng/ml), and remained consistently elevated (P less than 0.01) until day 120. Progesterone secretion was maintained in the pPRL-treated hysterectomized gilts from days 110-120 by the original corpora lutea and with no luteinization of follicles or formation of new corpora lutea. It is evident from this study that administration of pPRL starting on day 110 enhanced and prolonged the preprogramed release of relaxin and maintained progesterone secretion by aging corpora lutea in hysterectomized animals until day 120.\r"

By immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization PLF protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) were localized to the trophoblastic giant cells. Individual cells contained both PLF and placental lactogen II. Trophoblastic giant cells appear to secrete PLF into the circulation since PLF was found at levels up to 5 micrograms/ml in the serum of pregnant mice by RIA and at somewhat lower concentrations in the amniotic fluid. Moreover, the serum concentration of PLF during pregnancy varied directly with the level of PLF mRNA in the placenta and with the number of placentas per animal. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PLF is a placental hormone; its function is not known.\r"

As radiation inactivation is the only method available to measure the apparent molecular weights of membrane proteins in situ, we used this approach to define the functional sizes of OT receptors. The results indicate that both mammary and myometrial receptors are uniform in size and of similar molecular mass. Mammary and myometrial receptors were estimated to be 57.5 +/- 3.8 (SD) and 58.8 +/- 1.6 kilodaltons, respectively. Knowledge of the functional size of OT receptors will be useful in studies involving the purification and characterization of the receptor and associated membrane components.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we have demonstrated the presence of substances reacting like arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) in acid extracts of corpora lutea (CL) of pigs by RIA. The present study examined purified extracts of CL by using HPLC. The results of these experiments show that CL of nonpregnant sows contain AVP and OXT. Little is known about possible auto- and paracrine effects of AVP and OXT in the ovary. Therefore, we investigated the influence of AVP and OXT on progesterone, estradiol, and androstenedione secretion in porcine luteal cell cultures from nonpregnant sows. Progesterone and androstenedione secretion increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in the presence of ovine LH (oLH), whereas no change in basal estradiol levels could be observed under the same conditions. When AVP or OXT was added to the culture system a dose-dependent inhibition of basal as well as oLH-stimulated progesterone secretion was measured. Under basal conditions, a dose of 1 pg AVP/ml decreased progesterone secretion significantly (P less than 0.05), but to reach the same effect in the presence of OXT a dose of 100 ng/ml was necessary. In the presence of oLH the addition of as little as 0.01 pg AVP/ml inhibited progesterone secretion significantly (P less than 0.05). On the other hand, 10 ng OXT/ml or higher doses were needed to decrease oLH-stimulated progesterone release. In the presence of specific peptide antagonists the inhibitory effect on progesterone release was abolished. These results suggest that AVP and OXT effects are mediated through specific receptors. OXT and AVP also inhibited androstenedione secretion, but had no effect on estradiol secretion. Calculation of the ED50 data from dose-response curves of both peptides show that AVP is about 10(4)-fold more active than OXT in inhibiting in vitro progesterone and androstenedione secretion. This suggests that AVP as well as OXT may play an important role in the regulation of ovarian function.\r"

After 10-14 days with only insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS), the addition of estradiol (E) significantly increased PRL secretion compared to that in vehicle-treated controls. Simultaneous addition of E plus progesterone (P) increased PRL secretion similarly to E alone. PRL secretion in cultures treated with E plus P after 10 days induction by E was also similar to that in cultures maintained continuously in E. PRL secretion declined in wells switched from E to P and in wells switched from E back to vehicle, relative to that in wells maintained continuously in E. Estrogen receptors (ER) were detected in whole pituitary tissue and in serum-free pituitary cultures with a monoclonal antiestrogen receptor antibody (H222) in a sucrose density gradient shift assay. Immunocytochemical staining for ER with the same antibody also showed positive cell nuclei in serum-free pituitary cultures. In summary, ER are maintained in monkey pituitary cells during tissue culture, and PRL production can be further increased by E treatment after long term serum-free culture. Neither simultaneous nor sequential E plus P treatment alters PRL secretion compared to E alone.\r"

  ".U": "88195944\r", 
  ".W": "Studies in a variety of seasonally breeding mammals have shown that melatonin mediates photoperiodic effects on reproduction. Relatively little is known, however, about the site(s) or mechanisms of action of this hormone for inducing reproductive effects. Although binding sites for [3H]melatonin have been reported previously in bovine, rat, and hamster brain, the pharmacological selectivity of these sites was never demonstrated. In the present study, we have characterized binding sites for a new radioligand, 2-[125I]iodomelatonin, in brains from a photoperiodic species, the Syrian hamster. 2-[125I]Iodomelatonin labels a high affinity binding site in hamster brain membranes. Specific binding of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin is rapid, stable, saturable, and reversible. Saturation studies demonstrated that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binds to a single class of sites with an affinity constant (Kd) of 3.3 +/- 0.5 nM and a total binding capacity (Bmax) of 110.2 +/- 13.4 fmol/mg protein (n = 4). The Kd value determined from kinetic analysis (3.1 +/- 0.9 nM; n = 5) was very similar to that obtained from saturation experiments. Competition experiments showed that the relative order of potency of a variety of indoles for inhibition of 2-[125I]iodomelatonin binding site to hamster brain membranes was as follows: 6-chloromelatonin greater than or equal to 2-iodomelatonin greater than N-acetylserotonin greater than or equal to 6-methoxymelatonin greater than or equal to melatonin greater than 6-hydroxymelatonin greater than or equal to 6,7-dichloro-2-methylmelatonin greater than 5-methoxytryptophol greater than 5-methoxytryptamine greater than or equal to 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine greater than N-acetyltryptamine greater than serotonin greater than 5-methoxyindole (inactive). Compounds known to act at serotonergic, adrenergic, or dopaminergic receptors were either inactive or relatively ineffective as compared to melatonin. These results suggest that 2-[125I]iodomelatonin is a selective, high affinity probe for identifying melatonin receptor binding sites in rodent brain.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were carried out to explore the influence of soy protein and food restriction on age-related changes in serum PTH and bone. Three groups of male Fischer 344 rats were studied from 6 weeks of age. Group A rats were fed ad libitum diet A, which has casein as the protein source. Group B rats were fed diet B (with casein as protein source) at 60% of the mean ad libitum food intake. Group C rats were fed ad libitum diet C, which has soy protein as the protein source. The animals were killed at periodic intervals beginning at 6 months of age after an overnight fast. Serum PTH, measured with an intact N-terminal-specific RIA, and immunoreactive calcitonin increased progressively with aging. The increase was markedly suppressed by food restriction, and in the case of PTH by the soy protein diet as well. Serum creatinine started to increase after 18 months of age, and both dietary regimens of groups 2 and 3 retarded the increase. Aging was associated with a fall in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and loss of bone occurred during the terminal part of life in the ad libitum-fed animals. These were prevented by food restriction, while the soy protein diet delayed the onset of bone loss. We conclude from these findings and other data from this study that in the male F344 rats 1) an age-related increase in serum PTH precedes an age-related increase in serum creatinine concentration; 2) an age-related decline in renal function probably contributes to age-related hyperparathyroidism, which, in turn, contributes to senile bone loss; 3) food restriction inhibits age-related hyperparathyroidism and senile bone loss; 4) on the basis of the data from rats fed a soy protein-containing diet, a decline in renal function and progressive hyperparathyroidism are not inevitable consequences of aging in the ad libitum fed rats.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormones rapidly inhibit type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'DII) activity in the rat central nervous system, anterior pituitary gland, and GH3 pituitary tumor cells. To gain insight into the cellular mechanisms responsible for this down-regulation, the effects of substrates, inhibitors, and alterations in the cellular thiol-disulfide balance on 5'DII regulation were investigated. The results demonstrate that in vitro competitive inhibitors, such as iopanoic acid, as well as iodothyronine substrates induce a rapid and irreversible loss of enzyme activity in rat cerebral cortex and anterior pituitary tissue. The potency of these agents in down-regulating this enzymatic process in intact GH3 cells is directly related to their competitive inhibitory effects on 5'DII activity in vitro. Additional studies demonstrated that treatment of intact GH3 cells with the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide mimicks the effect of substrate and results in the rapid inactivation of 5'DII. In contrast, preincubation of cells with the sulfhydryl-reducing agent dithiothreitol renders the enzyme less susceptible to the down-regulatory effects of substrate. Sulfhydryl-reducing agents thus appear to play a dual role in the 5'DII process by serving as cosubstrates and by modulating the enzymes susceptibility to substrate-induced down-regulation. These findings suggest that the in vivo inhibition of 5'DII by thyroid hormones involves a unique mechanism of enzyme regulation whereby the binding of ligand to the active site induces the rapid and irreversible inactivation and/or degradation of the enzyme. This inactivation of 5'DII initiated by substrate binding may be mediated by alterations in the sulfhydryl state of the enzyme as it progresses through the catalytic cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that synthesis of a labile protein is required for stimulation of steroidogenesis in rat adrenocortical cells. Amino acids L-canavanine and L-S-aminoethylcysteine, at concentrations as high as 5 mM, each inhibited steroidogenesis to a much greater extent than they inhibited protein synthesis. S-Aminoethylcysteine caused a 50% decrease in the stimulated rate of corticosterone production under conditions where incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein was unchanged. Both amino acids block stimulation of steroid synthesis at a step subsequent to the formation of cAMP and before the synthesis of progesterone. The onset of this effect, after the addition of the amino acids, on corticosterone production is quite rapid. These results provide support, that is not dependent on inhibition of protein synthesis, for the hypothesis that a labile protein mediates stimulation of steroidogenesis. Reversal of canavanine and S-aminoethylcysteine inhibition of steroidogenesis by arginine and lysine, respectively, suggests that the inhibitors are functioning as amino acid analogs. S-Aminoethylcysteine inhibits the incorporation of [3H]lysine into protein as well as inhibits steroidogenesis; further, [3H]S-aminoethylcysteine is incorporated into protein that is nonstimulatory. These results suggest that lysine residues play an essential role in the function of the labile protein or that the labile protein contains a large number of lysine residues.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we compared the binding characteristics of methyltrienolone (R1881) in pooled cytosols from the hypothalamus-preoptic area-amygdala-septum (HPAS) of adult and fetal rhesus macaques. In addition, we studied the ontogeny of cytosolic androgen receptors (AR) in fetal neural tissue. Intact adult males and fetal rhesus monkeys of known gestational age were our experimental subjects. Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section at 50, 65, 80, and 150 days gestation. HPAS cytosols from 150-day fetuses and adult males were incubated with the synthetic ligand, [3H]R1881, for determining AR characteristics and to validate the assay. A single high affinity, low capacity receptor for R1881 was found in HPAS cytosols. The apparent dissociation constant was similar between adult and fetal HPAS (1.09 X 10(-10) vs. 1.59 X 10(-10) M, respectively). Binding specificity was determined by the addition of excess radioinert testosterone (T), 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, or progesterone to the incubation tube. R1881 binding was displaced by the addition of excess amounts of T and dihydrotestosterone, but not of estradiol or progesterone. There were no differences between fetal and adult animals. Single point analyses of AR numbers in fetal animals showed significant age and regional differences (P less than 0.05). Since no sex differences were apparent, data from males and females were combined. In the hypothalamus-preoptic area there was a significant increase in AR throughout gestation [1.3 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) fmol/mg protein; n = 7 (50 days gestation) vs. 6.2 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg protein; n = 4 (150 days of gestation); P less than 0.01]. These values differed significantly from adult male hypothalamic-preoptic area (14.1 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0.01; n = 3). AR levels in frontal and temporal cortex were high on day 50 of gestation, but showed a significant decline by day 150 (P less than 0.05). The administration of testosterone propionate (25 mg/kg.day) to pregnant animals from 40-50 days gestation, which resulted in elevated levels of serum T in female, but not male, fetuses had no effect on AR in any brain region studied. These studies confirm the presence of AR in fetal monkey brain. New information is provided on the changes in AR numbers in cortical and hypothalamic tissues during the critical period for sexual differentiation of the primate brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The DNA synthesis (S) phase of cultured GC cells, a clonal rat pituitary tumor cell line, is characterized by increases in nuclear receptors for T3 and glucocorticoid (G) hormones. However, this increased receptor abundance appears functionally dissociated from the GH gene since GH messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis is decreased in S-phase cells. We have now examined a putative structural correlate of this dissociation by measuring the abundance of T3 and G receptors and the GH gene in the nuclear matrix (NM)/scaffold fraction. NM of control and S-phase cultures both contained 30-50% of G receptors. Thirty to 50% of T3 receptors were also localized to NM of asynchronous cultures, but T3 receptor abundance (femtomoles per 100 micrograms of protein) was significantly decreased in NM of S-phase cultures: Exp 1 (control, 140 +/- 6.2; S-phase, 56.5 +/- 0.8; Exp 2 (control, 170 +/- 12; S-phase, 105 +/- 2.4). Nuclear scaffolds were digested with restriction enzymes to solubilize DNA loop structures and probed with GH complementary DNA (cDNA) to examine the distribution of transcribed regions of the GH gene. EcoR1 digestion resulted in an 11 kilobase fragment including the reported regulatory sequences for T3 receptors. No specific differences in GH gene localization to nuclear scaffold were observed between asynchronous and S-phase cultures or in different hormonal states. Thus, GH gene localization to nuclear scaffolds was not correlated with changes in transcription induced by T3 and G hormones or position in the cell cycle. These studies suggest that decreased concentration of T3 receptors in the NM fraction of S-phase cultures may be a structural correlate for cell cycle regulation of T3 receptor function.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of TSH, phorbol ester, norepinephrine (NE), and carbachol, agents known to influence thyroid metabolism, was compared on iodide organification in dog thyroid slices, freshly isolated follicles, and cultured cells. TSH stimulated iodide organification in all three types of preparations, and this effect was mimicked by (Bu)2cAMP. In contrast, the phorbol ester, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) stimulated iodide organification in slices and follicles but inhibited it in cells. The dose and time required for these divergent effects were similar. Other stimulators of protein kinase C such as aplysiatoxin and teleocidin mimicked the effects of TPA, and these effects were partially reversed by H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Pretreatment of cells with TPA for 4 h did not affect TSH-stimulated cAMP production, but TPA inhibited iodide organification in cells even in the presence of TSH or (Bu)2cAMP. Similarly NE and carbachol stimulated iodide organification in follicles but inhibited it in cells under basal as well as TSH-stimulated conditions. These effects of NE and carbachol were via alpha 2-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors, respectively. However, NE and carbachol inhibited TSH-stimulated cAMP production in both follicles and cells. In thyroid cells, carbachol inhibited uptake and increased efflux of iodide within minutes. TPA also produced similar effects after longer periods of incubation, where an inhibition of uptake was seen by 1 h and an increase in efflux by 2 h. NE had a marginal inhibitory effect on uptake and had no effect on efflux of iodide. In contrast to these agents, TSH increased uptake but not efflux of iodide. The present results suggest that the response of the freshly isolated tissue to phorbol esters, NE and carbachol differs from that of cells in culture with respect to an important metabolic function of the thyroid gland. These agents seem to have direct effects on iodide transport and organification unrelated to their effects on cAMP production.\r"

  ".W": "We have synthesized 16 alpha-iodo-4,9-estradien-17 beta-ol-3-one [delta 9-16 alpha-iodo-19-nortestosterone (delta 9-INT)] labeled with 125I (delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT) to provide a new gamma-emitting photoaffinity ligand for the progesterone receptor that has many advantages over the currently available [3H]R5020. We have characterized the interaction of delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT with the rabbit uterine progesterone receptor and have demonstrated the usefulness of this compound for studies of receptor structure. The binding of 2 nM [3H]progesterone to receptor in rabbit uterine cytosol was specifically competed for by 19-nortestosterone, 16 alpha-iodo-19-nortestosterone, and delta 9-INT. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT and [3H]progesterone estimated the same number of binding sites in rabbit uterine cytosol, with a Kd for delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT of about 2.7 nM. The binding of delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT was inhibited by both progesterone and R5020, whereas testosterone, estradiol, and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone were ineffective. In cytosol, delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT covalently labeled the same mol wt receptor forms as [3H]R5020. Although the efficiency of cross-linking was similar for [3H]R5020 (3%) and delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT (4%), the radioactivity was 10-fold greater due to the higher specific activity of delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT and the lack of sample quench. The use of delta 9-[16 alpha-125I]INT greatly increases the sensitivity and efficiency of the photoaffinity labeling technique; it will provide a valuable tool for further studies of the progesterone receptor, allowing the detection of receptor in dilute cytosol after gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions.\r"

Specific binding of 0.1 nM iodo-[Thr59]IGF-I to brain slices reached maximum by 12 h at 4 C and was unchanged at 24 h. Densitometry by computer digital image analysis of autoradiographic images indicated that specific binding of iodo-[Thr59]IGF-I to the median eminence was reversible. The specificity of binding was evaluated with competition of iodo-[Thr59]IGF-I with unlabeled [Thr59]IGF-I, rat IGF-II (multiplication-stimulating activity), and porcine insulin. All were recognized by the binding site, but the rank order of potency was [Thr59]IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Somatostatin was completely ineffective. Further, an antibody against the rat IGF-II receptor did not block binding of iodo-[Thr59]IGF-I to the median eminence. Fourteen days of food restriction (75% of food intake of controls) resulted in significant weight loss and reduction of plasma immunoreactive IGF-I in six food-restricted rats (0.9 +/- 0.1 U/ml) compared with values in six controls (2.6 +/- 0.5 U/ml; P less than 0.001). Binding of 125I-labeled [Thr59]IGF-I in the median eminence was significantly increased in the food-restricted rats, primarily due to an increase in the concentration of iodo-[Thr59]IGF-I-binding sites in the median eminence; the affinity (Kd) of binding was unchanged. The results indicate that the median eminence has type I IGF-I receptors, which become more numerous under metabolic conditions associated with decreased caloric intake and lowered plasma IGF-I levels.\r"

  ".U": "88195960\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the mechanism of estrogen's direct stimulation of steroidogenesis in the rabbit corpus luteum, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of estrogen on progestin production occurs at the site of processing of the precursor for pregnenolone (i.e. cholesterol) in the mitochondrion. For this purpose, we manipulated a model of estrogen stimulation by 1) removing sc estradiol-filled polydimethylsiloxane capsules from superovulated rabbits on day 9 of pseudopregnancy or 2) leaving the capsules in place to preserve a chronic estrogen stimulus. In the estrogen-deprived rabbits, the serum progesterone level fell precipitously in vivo within 24 h, but in rabbits with chronic estrogen stimulation, serum progesterone levels remained high. Our results show that the loss in progestin production caused by estrogen deprivation could not be attributed to loss of the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P-450scc), a common rate-limiting step in progestin synthesis in many steroidogenic tissues. In addition, we confirmed that there was no loss in the catalytic activity of this enzyme. Treatment with aminoglutethimide in vivo followed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of mitochondria (prepared in aminoglutethimide-free buffers) showed that incubation of isolated mitochondria at 37 C and pH 6.2 caused an increased high spin state (g = 8.2 signal) and a concomitant decreased low spin state. This shift from low to high spin states, which is indicative of cholesterol-P-450scc complex formation, occurred in the luteal mitochondria from both estrogen-deprived and estrogen-stimulated rabbits. In further studies to localize estrogen's regulatory point, we determined that the initial (first minute) rate of production of pregnenolone (per mg protein or per U P-450scc) from endogenous precursor proceeded equally fast in mitochondria from estrogen-deprived and those from estrogen-stimulated rabbits. However, the rapid pregnenolone production in the estrogen-deprived group lasted for a shorter time and, after 30 min, yielded less pregnenolone per mg protein or per U P-450scc than did mitochondria from estrogen-stimulated rabbits. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol did not increase the initial rate of pregnenolone formation, indicating that precursor availability is not limiting during the initial period. In aggregate, these observations suggest that the effect of estrogen on progestin production in the rabbit corpus luteum is not regulation of the movement of cholesterol to the catalytic site on the inner mitochondrial membrane, even though this is a step in the regulation of protein hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

On the evening of day 21 of pregnancy, primiparous Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally ovariectomized or sham operated and fitted with Silastic capsules containing one of four doses of E (6.0, 11.4, 45.6, or 68.4 micrograms in sesame oil) or sesame oil only. These rats were also injected sc with either 200 micrograms highly purified porcine R dissolved in 200 microliter 5% beeswax in corn oil or R vehicle three times (approximately 8 to 10-h intervals) beginning at ovariectomy. The durations of straining and delivery were increasingly prolonged with increasing doses of E in the ovariectomized groups that received E but no R. In rats that received the two highest doses of E there was a reduction in the percentage of pups born alive and a reduction in pups surviving on day 2 postpartum, and one or two undelivered fetuses were retained in utero in some animals 3 days postpartum. The administration of R with the two highest doses of E restored all parturition parameters to values not different from those of intact controls. In the absence of both E and R, all measured parturition parameters were abnormal, and administration of R in the absence of E only partially restored them to control values. Two major conclusions are drawn. First, E treatment alone to pregnant rats ovariectomized on day 21 fails to elicit normal parturition; indeed, with increasing doses of E, parturition parameters and pup survival become increasingly adversely affected. Second, R treatment of E-treated ovariectomized rats during the immediate preparturient period restores parturition parameters and pup survival to the levels of intact sham-operated controls.\r"

These studies report the effects of thyroid status on the activity of hepatic delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in heme synthesis. Thyroidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats received sc injections of diluent or hormones. T3 was found to stimulate ALAS activity in the liver in doses which rendered the animals euthyroid (0.3 microgram/100 g BW.day). Higher doses failed to enhance enzyme activity further. T4 had similar effects but was less potent; rT3 had no effect on ALAS activity. The administration of a large single dose of T3 (50 micrograms/100 g BW) produced a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in ALAS activity 72 h later. Allylisopropylacetamide administration induced ALAS activity to identical levels in both hypothyroid and T3-replaced animals when administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg body wt. A dose of 400 mg/kg body wt allylisopropylacetamide, one associated with maximal induction of ALAS, resulted in an 80% higher enzyme activity in T3-treated animals compared with controls. Exogenous T3 had no effect on ALAS activity in sham-operated animals. These findings indicate that thyroid status can influence the activity of ALAS, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of heme in rat liver, as well as heme degradation and the content of cytochrome P450 in this organ.\r"

Autoradiographic analysis of the binding of 125I-labeled [Sar1,Ile8]AII to rat, rhesus monkey, cebus monkey, and human testicular slide-mounted frozen sections indicated specific binding to Leydig cells in the interstitium. In rat collagenase-dispersed interstitial cells fractionated by Percoll gradient, AII receptor content was parallel to that of hCG receptors, confirming that the AII receptors are in the Leydig cells. In rat dispersed Leydig cells, binding was specific for AII and its analogs and of high affinity (Kd, 4.8 nM), with a receptor concentration of 15 fmol/10(6) cells. Studies of AII receptors in rat testes during development reveals the presence of high receptor density in newborn rats which decreases toward the adult age (4934 +/- 309, 1460 +/- 228, 772 +/- 169, and 82 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein at 5, 15, 20, and 30 days of age, respectively) with no change in affinity. At all ages receptors were located in the interstitium, and the decrease in binding was parallel to the decrease in the interstitial to tubular ratio observed with age. AII receptor properties in membrane-rich fractions from prepuberal testes were similar in the rat and rhesus monkey. Binding was time and temperature dependent, reaching a plateau at 60 min at 37 C, and was increased by divalent cations, EGTA, and dithiothreitol up to 0.5 mM. In membranes from prepuberal monkey testes, AII receptors were specific for AII analogs and of high affinity (Kd, 4.2 nM) with a receptor concentration of 7599 +/- 1342 fmol/mg protein. The presence of AII receptors in Leydig cells in rat and primate testes in conjunction with reports of the presence of other components of the renin-angiotensin system in the testes suggests that the peptide has a physiological role in testicular function.\r"

  ".W": "The decrease in intestinal calcium absorption and lower blood levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D3] have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis. This study evaluates the effects on bone of 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy using the ovariohysterectomized dog model. The cessation of ovarian function was ascertained by an increase in serum LH levels 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy, and significant bone loss was revealed four months after ovariohysterectomy. The bone loss was associated with an increase in the number of bone-forming cells and a decrease in the activity of these cells. The administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 increased the activity of the bone cells and resulted in a reversal of all abnormalities in structural parameters of bone, including cancellous bone mass, trabecular wall thickness, trabecular plate separation, trabecular plate density, and trabecular plate thickness (which increased above normal). However, 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy was also associated with a significant decrease in the number of bone-forming cells, resulting in lower bone formation at the tissue level. The results of this study indicate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy can reverse the bone loss and osteoblastic insufficiency responsible for the maintenance of negative bone balance after the cessation of ovarian function. However, this therapy has a suppressive effect on bone cell number and bone turnover. This undesired side-effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy renders a chronic therapeutic regimen inefficient for the long term management of patients with osteoporosis. Intermittent 1,25-(OH)2D3 therapy or a sequential therapy using 1,25-(OH)2D3 along with substances known to increase the number of bone-forming cells is strongly suggested by these results.\r"

  ".W": "The peripheral aromatization ([rho]BM) of androstenedione (A) and testosterone (T) was measured before and after administration of the aromatase inhibitor 10-(2 propynyl)estr-4-ene-3,17-dione (MDL-18,962) to five mature female baboons, Papio annubis. The measurements were made by infusing [3H]androstenedione/[14C]estrone or [3H]testosterone/[14C]estradiol for 3.5 h and collecting blood samples during the infusions and all urine for 96 h from the start of the infusion. Blood samples were analyzed for radioactivity as infused and product steroids, and the data were used to calculate MCRs. An aliquot of the pooled urine was analyzed for the glucuronides of estrone and estradiol and used to calculate the [rho]BM. MDL-18,962 was administered as a pulse in polyethylene glycol-400 (1-5 ml) either iv or via gastric tube 30 min before administration of the radiolabeled steroids. Control studies were done with and without polyethylene glycol-400 administration. When MDL-18,962 was given iv at 4 mg/kg, the aromatization of A was decreased 91.8 +/- 0.9% from the control value of 1.23 +/- 0.13% to 0.11 +/- 0.01%. At the same dose, aromatization of T was decreased 82.0 +/- 7.1%, from a control value of 0.20 +/- 0.03% to 0.037 +/- 0.018%. When MDL-18,962 was given iv at doses of 0.4, 0.1, 0.04, and 0.01 mg/kg, the values for aromatization of A were 0.16 +/- 0.03%, 0.18 +/- 0.06%, 0.37 +/- 11%, and 0.65 +/- 0.09%, respectively. The administration of MDL-18,962 via gastric tube at 4 mg/kg as a pulse decreased the aromatization of A from 1.35 +/- 0.06% to 0.43 +/- 0.12%, an inhibition of 67.2 +/- 10.7%. When administered via gastric tube daily for 5 days at 4 mg/kg, the aromatization of A fell from 1.35 +/- 0.06% to 0.063 +/- 0.003%, an inhibition of 84.4 +/- 0.5%. The MCRs of A and estrone were not altered by any dose of MDL-18,962 regardless of the mode of administration, but there was an increase in the MCRs of T and estradiol at the only dose (4 mg/kg, iv) at which these steroids were infused. The interconversions between the androgens and between the estrogens were not altered by the administration of MDL-18,962 at 4 mg/kg, iv. The enzyme-activated inhibitor MDL-18,962 is an effective inhibitor of [rho BM] in female baboons and could prove to be a useful therapeutic agent in treating estrogen-dependent breast cancer.\r"

Pregnant baboons (Papio anubis) were untreated (n = 10) or received MER-25 (25 mg/kg BW, orally; n = 10) daily on days 140-170 of gestation (term, 184 days). Placentas were removed by cesarean section on day 170 of gestation, and villous tissue was dispersed with 0.1% collagenase at 37 C for 40 min. Placental cells (10(6)) were incubated in medium 199 (pH 7.2) for 12 h at 37 C with increasing amounts (5-100 micrograms) of [125I]LDL, with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled baboon LDL. Mean (+/- SE) peripheral serum P4 concentrations on days 140-170 of gestation were 51% lower (P less than 0.01) in MER-25-treated (5.7 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) than in untreated (11.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) baboons. The uptake of LDL was 56% lower (P less than 0.01) in placental cells from antiestrogen-treated (6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/micrograms cell protein) than in those from untreated (14.4 +/- 1.9 ng/micrograms cell protein) baboons. The dissociation constants for placental LDL uptake, as assessed by Scatchard analysis, however, were similar in untreated (0.80 microgram/ml) and MER-25-treated (0.76 microgram/ml) animals. The amount of [125I]LDL concomitantly degraded by cells from baboons that received MER-25 was 54% of that degraded by cells from untreated controls. The relative decline in LDL degradation by cells of antiestrogen-treated baboons was proportionate to the decline in overall LDL uptake. The results indicate, therefore, that antiestrogen treatment decreased the amount of placental LDL uptake, but did not change the affinity for the lipoprotein. We suggest that the decline in placental P4 production elicited in pregnant baboons by antiestrogen results, at least in part, from subnormal LDL uptake. We propose that one of the mechanisms by which estrogen regulates the biosynthesis of P4 by the placenta during baboon pregnancy is by increasing receptor-mediated placental cell uptake of cholesterol in the form of LDL. Estrogen, therefore, may regulate LDL uptake by the placenta and thus the availability of cholesterol for P4 biosynthesis via the LDL pathway.\r"

Serum IGF-I increased from 82.9 +/- (SE) 9.0 to 137.0 +/- 15.4 ng/ml. In acute studies, where the slopes of 4-point dose-response curves were compared, oPRL was approximately 50% as potent as oGH in stimulating serum IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I messenger RNA accumulation. In chronic experiments, where a single daily injection of oPRL (0, 10, 30, or 90 micrograms/day) was administered for 10 days, a significant increase in body wt was observed at each dose. However, in contrast to hypox rats which received oGH, no dose-response relationship was apparent, and oPRL was less than 10% as potent as oGH in this regard. A small but significant increase in serum IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I expression was observed in hypox rats chronically injected with oPRL when killed 6-7 h after the final injection. However, by extrapolation from the hGH dose-response curves, oPRL was 6.8% and 22.7% as potent as hGH in stimulating serum IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I accumulation respectively. The observations reported here demonstrate that oPRL has significant somatogenic activity in the rat as determined by the three variables measured. Whereas oPRL had significant effects on body weight gain, serum IGF-I and hepatic IGF-I expression, the potency of oPRL by comparison with the two other somatogenic hormones was more marked in acute experiments compared to the effects seen after chronic administration. These results suggest that oPRL, like human GH, has both somatogenic and lactogenic activity in the rat and therefore may be an inappropriate control in studies of the effects of somatogenic hormones in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The beta-COOH-terminal peptide region (beta CTP) of hCG is an important immunochemical domain that is specific to hCG but absent from homologous hLH. Three types of polyclonal antibodies can be elicited to the beta CTP portion of hCG. The first and most common recognizes the beta CTP amino acid sequence independent of its carbohydrate content (carbohydrate-oblivious). It can be elicited against synthetic beta CTP as well as against native or asialo beta CTP. The second type binds best to desialylated beta CTP, (galactose-requiring). The third type binds well only to sialylated beta CTP (sialic acid-requiring). All three types of antisera recognize the sialylated beta CTP as equivalent to the whole hormone on a molar basis, indicating that this peptide region of the whole hormone is neither sequestered nor conformationally altered. We have characterized the epitopes for the sialic acid-requiring and galactose-requiring beta CTP antisera. Both require elements of the primary amino acid sequence of beta hCG as well as specific elements of the carbohydrate side-chains and, therefore, are not directed solely to either peptide or carbohydrate determinants. The galactose-requiring beta CTP antiserum was generated to an ovalbumin conjugate of a desialylated form of beta CTP, beta 123-145. It binds desialylated forms 1000 times better than it binds native hCG, and binds neither synthetic beta CTP nor asialo-agalacto beta 123-141. The antiserum requires residues 123-141 and a portion of an O-serine-linked oligosaccharide chain. Its binding requirements are, thus, very different from those of the carbohydrate-oblivious beta CTP antiserum, which requires the last two residues of the hCG beta polypeptide chain and is not sensitive to the presence or absence of carbohydrate. The sialic acid-requiring beta CTP antiserum, which was generated to sialylated beta 123-145-thyroglobulin conjugate, binds well to sialylated beta CTP, but poorly to asialo beta CTP and not at all to the carbohydrate-free synthetic peptide. This antiserum requires the entire beta 123-145 sequence as well as sialic acid-terminated oligosaccharide side-chains. Since the sialylated peptide beta 115-141 binds poorly to it, this antiserum resembles the carbohydrate-oblivious anti-beta CTP; both require the COOH-terminal amino acids of hCG beta. However, the former requires intact O-linked carbohydrate moieties for binding. These antisera can be used to assess the primary protein and carbohydrate structures of beta CTP at low concentrations in urine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The size distribution of IGF-binding protein was determined by affinity cross-linking to [125I]IGF-I, and the binding activity was quantified by a polyethylene glycol precipitation procedure. The major [125I]IGF-I-binding protein complex was of 38,000 mol wt (Mr) in all porcine sera or plasma tested. Binding to this protein was inhibited by excess unlabeled IGF-I, but not by insulin. When plasma samples from fetuses at 45, 70, 90, and 110 days gestation were cross-linked to [125I]IGF-I, there was an increase in the concentration of the 38,000 Mr complex with advancing gestational age, whereas plasma from the mothers of the age-matched fetuses showed little change in the amount of the 38,000 Mr complex. When the binding activity of the fetal plasma was quantified, there was a significant increase in binding activity between 45 and 110 days gestation from 30.5 +/- 3.3% to 77.5 +/- 3.6% (+/- SE) of the assay maximum. This increase was not due to a decrease in binding protein saturation, since the endogenous IGF-I levels (quantified after acid gel filtration chromatography) also increased with advancing gestational age, from 176 to 458 mU/ml. Blood samples were collected from porcine fetuses at 110 days gestation that had either been decapitated or spinal cauterized at 45 days gestation. Decapitation decreased the amount of the 38,000 Mr complex that could be detected by affinity labeling. In contrast, spinal cauterization had no effect on the amount of the 38,000 Mr complex in fetal plasma compared to that in control fetal plasma. These results were verified in the polyethylene glycol assay. These studies show that the amount of the 38,000 Mr IGF-binding protein complex in pig plasma is developmentally regulated and suggest that a pituitary or neural factor may be an important variable in the control of its plasma concentrations.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies against MHC class I antigen were able to stimulate testosterone production in mouse Leydig cells with the same potency as LH. This biological effect depends on the concentration of antibody used and could be abolished by a LH antagonist. There is a perfect parallelism, for each monoclonal antibody, between the specificity for a particular haplotype and the response of the target cells from the strains carrying such a haplotype. The same antibodies were able to precipitate the soluble LH/hCG receptors, as both a hormone-receptor complex and a free receptor. The results suggest that bound hormone triggers an association of the MHC class I antigen with the LH/hCG receptor, resulting in activation of the target cell.\r"

The present studies were undertaken to study the possible role of VIP in the regulation of steroid hormone secretion from the outer zones of the normal rat adrenal cortex. Capsule-glomerulosa preparations, consisting of the capsule, zona glomerulosa, and a small but variable portion of the zona fasciculata, were perifused in vitro. To assess the secretory responsiveness of the capsule-glomerulosa preparation, aldosterone and corticosterone release were measured after stimulation with ACTH and angiotensin II. ACTH (10(-12)-10(-8) M) stimulated dose-dependent increases in aldosterone secretion (1.9- to 36.9-fold increases over basal values) and corticosterone secretion (1.4- to 14.0-fold increases over basal values). Angiotensin II (10(-8)-10(-5) M) stimulated dose-dependent increases in aldosterone secretion (1.6- to 8.8-fold increases over basal values). VIP (10(-6)-10(-4) M) stimulated dose-dependent increases in both aldosterone (1.7- to 41.0-fold) and corticosterone secretion (1.8- to 5.3-fold). However, glucagon and (N-Ac-Tyr1-D-Phe2)GRF-(1-29)NH2, peptides structurally related to VIP, stimulated neither aldosterone nor corticosterone secretion, indicating that VIP effects are likely to be specific for this peptide. It is noteworthy that in this preparation, the stimulation of corticosteroid secretion by VIP at 10(-5) and 10(-4) M was comparable to those by 10(-6) M angiotensin II and 10(-9) M ACTH, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that the VIP innervation of the adrenal cortex may contribute directly to the regulation of adrenal steroidogenesis.\r"

Dose-response curves were prepared for in vitro bone resorption induced in neonatal mouse calvaria by tumor extract, bPTH-(1-34), and prostaglandin E2. A 1:2000-fold ratio of bPTH-(1-34) to [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide significantly inhibited bone resorption induced by bPTH-(1-34); however, a 1:10,000 ratio completely antagonized bone resorption. At equivalent potency (1.80-fold stimulation of in vitro bone resorption) of tumor extract compared to bPTH-(1-34), [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide (5.0 microM) was capable of significantly reducing in vitro bone resorption. Bone resorption induced by tumor extract (1.35-fold stimulation) was inhibited by [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide at concentrations of 5.0 and 1.0 microM. Bone resorption induced by prostaglandin E2 (300 nM) was not inhibited by [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide (5.0 microM). These data indicate that [Nle8,18,Tyr34]bPTH-(3-34) amide antagonizes in vitro bone resorption induced by bPTH-(1-34) in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibits bone resorption induced by the canine adenocarcinoma model of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "The placenta expresses genes for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and possesses IGF-receptors, suggesting that placental growth is regulated by IGFs in an autocrine manner. We have previously shown that human decidua, but not placenta, synthesizes and secretes a 34 K IGF-binding protein (34 K IGF-BP) called placental protein 12. We now used human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cell monolayer cultures and recombinant (Thr59)IGF-I as a model to study whether the decidual 34 K IGF-BP is able to modulate the receptor binding and biological activity of IGFs in trophoblasts. JEG-3 cells, which possess type I IGF receptors, were unable to produce IGF-BPs. Purified 34 K IGF-BP specifically bound [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I. Multiplication-stimulating activity had 2.5% the potency of (Thr59)IGF-I, and insulin had no effect on the binding of [125I] iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I. 34 K IGF-BP inhibited the binding of [125I] iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I to JEG-3 monolayers in a concentration-dependent manner by forming with the tracer a soluble complex that could not bind to the cell surface as demonstrated by competitive binding and cross-linking experiments. After incubating the cell monolayers with [125I]iodo-(Thr59)IGF-I in the presence of purified binding protein, followed by cross-linking, no affinity labeled bands were seen on autoradiography. In contrast, an intensely labeled band at 40 K was detected when the incubation medium was analyzed, suggesting that (Thr59)IGF-I and 34 K IGF-BP formed a complex in a 1:1 molar ratio. Also, 34 K IGF-BP inhibited both basal and IGF-I-stimulated uptake of alpha-[3H]aminoisobutyric acid in JEG-3 cells. RNA analysis revealed that IGF-II is expressed in JEG-3 cells. We conclude that decidual 34 K IGF-BP inhibits the cellular binding and biological action of IGFs in JEG-3 cells. Our data show that JEG-3 cells represent a cell type that can produce IGF, but not IGF-BPs. These cells may thus provide a useful model system for a better understanding of autocrine growth regulation mediated by the IGFs.\r"

To further study this process at the single cell level, glucocorticoid effects on rat thymocyte DNA were analyzed using fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. Thymocytes were isolated from adrenalectomized rats, treated in vitro with steroid hormones, stained with 0.1 mM acridine orange, and analyzed by flow cytometry. After 5 h of treatment with 10(-7) M dexamethasone a population of thymocytes with reduced acridine orange binding was observed. Thymocyte viability after glucocorticoid treatment was greater than 95%, indicating that the observed changes in dye binding occurred before cell death. Induction of this subpopulation of thymocytes was both time and steroid concentration dependent, being detectable within 2 h of in vitro steroid treatment. This response to glucocorticoids was blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486, indicating a steroid receptor-mediated process. Furthermore, both actinomycin D and cycloheximide blocked the appearance of this glucocorticoid effect, thus demonstrating a dependence upon RNA and protein biosynthesis, respectively. Incubation of thymocytes with inhibitors of DNA repair (aminobenzamide or methylnicotinamide) also diminished acridine orange binding to thymocytes. The effects of these DNA repair inhibitors and glucocorticoids were additive, suggesting independent mechanisms of action. Dexamethasone treatment (10(-7) M) of cells that fail to die in response to glucocorticoids (HeLa S3) had no effect on dye binding. These findings are consistent with the concept that glucocorticoids induce a lysis gene product that alters the thymocyte genome and thus leads to cell death.\r"

A similar result was obtained in studies with L-[35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Vitamin D deficiency specifically elevated levels of a 45-kilodalton mitochondrial protein (pI 5.0 to 5.5) by approximately 5- to 12-fold relative to amounts present in vitamin D-replete tissue. This protein could not be detected in postmitochondrial supernatant fractions and was only faintly visible in crude kidney homogenates. The specificity of the observed suppression of this 45-kilodalton protein by vitamin D suggests that it may play an important role in renal functions influenced by the vitamin D endocrine system.\r"

Uteri that were exposed, but not manipulated, served as controls. Uterine and DT weights as well as UBF, rates, were subsequently recorded on either day 5 or 10 posttrauma. Oil treatment failed to induce an increase in either control or traumatized uterine weights between days 5 and 10, and trauma had no effect on UBF rates in either group. Daily progesterone (P; 2 mg) treatment induced a significant elevation in DT weight by day 10 and elevated UBF rates between days 5 and 10 relative to control values. Daily P treatment augmented by estradiol (E2; 1 microgram) therapy on days 0 and 1 induced a significant increase in DT weights and UBF rates between days 5 and 10 in both control and DT groups relative to those in oil-treated animals. Combined P and E2 (P/E2) treatment induced a moderate increase in DT weight by day 10 posttrauma and elevated UBF rates in both control and DT groups. Acute treatment (i.e. days -3 to 0) with these steroid regimens indicated that neither P nor P/E2 treatment maintained DT growth. However, day -3 to 0 treatment with P in combination with a single day 0 injection of E2 allowed for maximal DT growth by day 10 and maintained elevated UBF rates relative to control values. P/E2 treatment between days -3 and 0 also induced an increase in UBF rates in both control and DT uteri relative to those in oil-treated animals. These results indicate that E2 is essential for supporting the P-directed differentiation and proliferation of stimulated guinea pig endometrium into DT. The ability of decidualization to occur in the absence of chronic steroid support indicates that uterine sensitization for cellular differentiation in this species only requires that the endometrium be initially primed by ovarian steroid hormones, but that subsequent growth is autonomous.\r"

We have investigated the GH dependency of tissue IGF-I gene expression in rats harboring implanted somatomammotropic tumors. Circulating GH and radioimmunoassayable IGF-I levels were markedly elevated in these animals. Hepatic IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts were induced about 5-fold in the tumor-bearing rats relative to control animals, and about 50-fold relative to the hypophysectomized liver IGF-I mRNA. IGF-I mRNA content was also modestly induced in the heart, muscle, and kidney of the tumor-bearing animals. IGF-I mRNA transcripts of 8.0, 6.2, 3.8, 2.4, 1.3, and 1.0 kilobases were markedly stimulated in the pituitaries of the GH-tumor bearing rats relative to control pituitaries. Pituitary IGF-I mRNA induction was maximal between 2 and 6 weeks after tumor implantation, a time at which circulating GH levels were also increasing sharply. As previously reported, pituitary GH mRNA was inhibited in tumor-bearing rats. The stimulation of pituitary IGF-I gene expression in these animals, therefore, appears to be dependent on circulating, and not local, pituitary GH concentrations. These data support the GH dependency of pituitary IGF-I gene expression. IGF-I is known to decrease GH production in vitro. High circulating levels of IGF-I present in these animals may account for the observed inhibition of GH gene expression. These data raise the alternative possibility that induction of locally produced IGF-I may contribute to this phenomenon.\r"

In the present study, the interrelationship between thyroid hormone and adrenergic agents, and the concept that calcium serves as the first messenger for the rapid action of thyroid hormone in the rat thymocyte are further examined. T3 produced a very rapid and dose-related increase in both 45 calcium accumulation and cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. These effects of T3, like its other calcium-dependent and prompt effects, were inhibited by beta-, but not by alpha-, adrenergic antagonists. Studies with selective beta-adrenergic agents revealed that the inhibitory effect was beta-1 in nature. In addition, beta-adrenergic agonists were found to promote additively T3 action, possibly through their beta-2 activity. Hence, the present study provides further support for the concept that calcium serves as the first messenger in the rapid, plasma membrane-mediated action of thyroid hormone in the rat thymocyte.\r"

  ".W": "In differentiated adipocytes of the 3T3-F442A cell line, 4-h incubation with human GH transiently stimulates glucose oxidation and lipid accumulation. When the incubation is extended to 48 h, hGH suppresses these indicators of glucose metabolism. The stimulation of glucose oxidation or lipid accumulation required a period of serum deprivation before incubation with GH, while the later inhibitory effect of GH occurred equally well whether or not cells were serum-deprived. Since the 3T3-F442A adipocytes differentiate in culture from preadipocyte fibroblasts, we examined the importance of the state of differentiation on metabolic responses to GH. GH had no reproducible effect on glucose oxidation after 4 or 48 h in the preadipocyte fibroblasts. To determine whether the effects of GH on glucose metabolism involved changes in glucose transport, the uptake of a low concentration (558 nM) of [14C]glucose was measured in the adipocytes. Glucose uptake increased 2- to 4-fold after 5-15 min of incubation with GH. This rapid response peaked in 15-30 min and subsided by 120 min despite the continued presence of GH. After 24 h of incubation with GH, glucose uptake was inhibited. In preadipocytes, GH occasionally stimulated glucose uptake in a transient manner. When present, the stimulation was generally of lesser magnitude and shorter duration than in the adipocytes. No inhibition of glucose uptake was observed in the preadipocytes after 24 h of incubation. These differences in responsiveness of the preadipocytes compared to the adipocytes cannot be attributed to differences in receptor binding or detectable differences in GH receptor type or size, as determined by migration of [125I]iodohuman GH-receptor complexes in electrophoretic gels. These findings indicate that GH rapidly alters glucose uptake in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. The changes in glucose uptake most likely play a major role in the GH-induced changes in the conversion of glucose to lipid and CO2 observed previously. These metabolic responses to GH are dependent on the adipose conversion of the 3T3-F442A cells. As the 3T3-F442A cells express the adipocyte phenotype, development of increased metabolic regulation by GH appears to require changes in postbinding or postreceptor phenomena.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that oligodendrocytes do not contain nuclear T3 receptors, which is in apparent contradiction with the well-known effects of thyroid hormones on myelination. In this study we have reexamined the presence of receptors in this cell population, using pure rat oligodendrocyte cultures. T3 binding was also studied with the use of pure rat astrocytes as well as in mixed neuronal-glial cultures. The latter are mainly neuronal during the first days in culture and essentially glial thereafter. Binding studies carried out in intact cells demonstrated the presence of high affinity-low capacity binding sites for thyroid hormones in pure cultures of oligodendrocytes. The maximal binding capacity was 50-60 fmol/100 micrograms DNA and the dissociation constant (Kd) 0.13 nM. Pure rat astrocyte cultures also contained high affinity sites for thyroid hormones, although receptor concentrations was 2-3 times lower than in oligodendrocytes or neurons. This was confirmed in pure cultures of chick astrocytes and in neuronal-glial cultures during the astroglial period. The relative affinity of the receptor for thyroid hormone analogs was triiodothyroacetic acid = T3 greater than T4 greater than tetraiodothyroacetic acid in oligodendrocyte and astrocyte nuclei, and the sedimentation coefficient of the receptor was approximately 3.8S in both cell types. These results demonstrate that nuclear T3 receptors similar to those found in neurons and astrocytes are also present in oligodendrocytes. This suggests that the effects of thyroid hormones on myelination could result from a direct action of the hormone in the oligodendrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Hypophysectomy of mice during the last half of pregnancy results in an increase in the maternal serum mouse placental lactogen-II (mPL-II) concentration. The present study was undertaken to isolate and identify the pituitary factors that regulate mPL-II. Administration of pituitary extracts from virgin and day 12 pregnant mice (five pituitaries per mouse, every 8 h, sc) and bilateral pituitary implants under the kidney capsule significantly inhibited the increase in the mPL-II concentration that occurs within 24 h after hypophysectomy on day 12 of pregnancy, which indicated that the pituitary secretes factors that regulate mPL-II. To characterize these factors biochemically, pituitaries from virgin female mice were incubated for 14 days, and the culture medium was pooled, concentrated, and then fractionated by gel exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100, followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE. The fraction from DEAE chromatography that contained predominantly mouse (m) GH as well as a very small amount of a substance with an approximate mol wt of 23K suppressed the posthypophysectomy rise in serum mPL-II. To determine whether purified PRL, GH, and the unknown 23K substance present in the active fraction from the DEAE column could suppress the posthypophysectomy rise in serum mPL-II, repeated injections and constant infusion of these substances were carried out in hypophysectomized mice. Repeated injections of purified mPRL and bovine (b) PRL and constant infusion of mPRL were without effect. Repeated injection of mGH at doses of 1 and 10 micrograms/mouse or of bGH at doses of 50, 150, and 450 micrograms/mouse were also not effective, but bGH injections at a dose of 5 mg/mouse suppressed the posthypophysectomy rise in serum mPL-II. Subsequently, two pools of mGH were prepared by ion exchange HPLC; mGH-A contained predominantly mGH as well as a very small amount of an unidentified 23K mol wt substance, and mGH-B contained only mGH. When mGH-A and mGH-B were infused at a constant rate into hypophysectomized pregnant mice, both suppressed serum mPL-II concentrations; there was no difference in activity between mGH-A and mGH-B. These results indicate that mGH, but not mPRL, regulates the serum PL-II concentration in the mouse. mPL-II secretion is under the inhibitory control of mGH, the concentration of which increases rapidly at the beginning of the last half of pregnancy.\r"

Measurements of circulating concentrations of progesterone confirmed that the longer inter-estrous intervals were due to an increase in corpus luteum lifespan following treatment with interferon.

We report here a simple, rapid and reproducible method for obtaining large numbers of highly enriched TIC using density gradient centrifugation. When dispersed cells from ovaries of hypophysectomized immature rats were centrifuged in a Percoll gradient (20-70%), the cells were separated into five incompletely resolved bands. Of these, band V contained the androgen-producing cells. The band V cells produced 3.2- and 3.9-fold more cAMP and androgen, respectively, than the whole ovarian cells and contained 3.8- and 3.5-fold more 125I-hCG binding and 3 beta-HSDH labeled cells, respectively. These data indicated that the TIC were 65% pure. In order to improve the degree of purification, a discontinuous density procedure was used. When the ovarian cells were centrifuged in d = 1.055 g/ml Percoll, the purified TIC produced 4.7- and 5.9-fold more cAMP and androgen than the whole ovarian cells and they contained 5.3-fold more 125I-hCG binding. The TIC were cleanly separated from the granulosa cells and histochemical staining for 3 beta-HSDH activity revealed that the TIC were 93.0 +/- 1.3% pure. This method provides, for the first time, the opportunity to study TIC differentiation under defined conditions without granulosa cell contamination.\r"

Ova were recovered from tubal flushings between 48 and 120 hours after the midcycle peak of luteinizing hormone in 39% of the IUD users compared with 56% of women in the control group (0.05 less than P less than 0.10). This suggests an action of the IUD before the ovum reaches the uterus. Eggs with a microscopic appearance consistent with fertilization were recovered from the fallopian tubes of half of the women using no contraception who had intercourse within the fertile period of the reproductive cycle and from whom ova were recovered. In contrast (P less than 0.01), no eggs with this appearance were recovered in IUD users who had intercourse within the fertile period. No ova were recovered from the body of the uterus of any of the IUD users. Fertilized ova are less likely to reach the uterine cavity containing an IUD. Thus, the principal mode of IUDs is by a method other than destruction of live embryos.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in a series of 600 consecutive normal liveborns. Significantly higher frequencies for translocations and polymorphisms were present in couples with repetitive abortion. No sex predominance in translocation carriers was observed, and reciprocal translocations were more common (16 of 19) than the robertsonian type (3 of 19). Contrary to other reports, all of the translocations and inversions were detected among couples without previous abnormal offspring. Cytogenetic prenatal testing in 17 pregnancies from a carrier parent showed that none of the fetuses had the unbalanced karyotype, 13 carried the balanced rearrangement, and 4 had a normal karyotype. Although a risk profile can be obtained for these couples, prenatal testing must be offered to avoid anxiety and unjustified pregnancy interruptions.\r"

A simple set of guidelines is described involving three obvious milestones for the breast-feeding mother to safely use the natural contraceptive benefit of breast-feeding. Those milestones are: the first vaginal bleeding episode, the initiation of supplementation, and the child's monthly birthday. In the absence of bleeding and supplementation, 100% of breast-feeding mothers remained anovular for 3 months postpartum, 96% for 4 months, 96% for 5 months, and 96% for 6 months. This suggests that, if a mother understands these three conditions, she can use breast-feeding alone as effectively as modern family planning methods for the prevention of pregnancy.\r"

Steroid hormonal patterns were within the range for the normal menstrual cycle and endometrial biopsies taken on day 21 or 22 of the treatment cycles were independently assessed as being representative of day 21 +/- 2. Four of 12 transfers were successful (31%): 1 patient aborted at 6 weeks, and the three others were delivered, one normally and two by cesarian sections. The authors' practice suggests the following: (1) steroid supplementation by transdermal and transvaginal routes is effective, (2) synchronization between donor and recipient is no longer required with the use of frozen-thawed embryos, and (3) the \"temporal window\" is large since all the replacements were done on day 14 of the cycle.\r"

Seven of 26 zygotes and 4 of 24 cleaved embryos implanted, with the incidence of implantation being analyzed in relation to 12 morphologic characteristics. Smooth surface of the blastomere's membranes was a statistically significant predictor of implantation for frozen-cleaved embryos, and variable zona pellucida thickness was the only parameter with predictive value for frozen zygotes. A highly significant difference was found between the implanting capacity of previously frozen-cleaved embryos and the number of abnormal morphologic characteristics. Three quarters of the thawed embryos had at least two abnormal characteristics, indicating that cryodamage was high. Major advantages of videocinematography are the absence of time constraints associated with observing live embryos, the ability to observe new morphologic parameters by freeze-frame and slow motion, and the permanent storage of embryonic data for quality control evaluation.\r"

The objectives of the study were to determine the effect of a synthetic progestin, given for 5 to 14 days beginning on day 21 of the cycle before the IVF cycle, on folliculogenesis, estrogen secretion, the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, luteal function, and IVF success. It was found that this treatment was easy to administer and well tolerated by patients. At the 10-mg dose, patients uniformly had vaginal bleeding 2 to 4 days after NE, whereas 40% of patients using the 2.5-mg dose bled before NE was discontinued. Significantly lower estrone glucuronide excretion in the early follicular phase and lower luteal phase pregnanediol excretion in patients receiving 10 mg NE suggested a delay or reduction of developing follicles after luteal phase suppression. No spontaneous LH surges were found in the 10-mg group, compared with surges in 5 of the 13 cycles of the 2.5-mg group. There were no differences between regimens in cycle or luteal phase length. It is postulated that NE, by suppressing folliculogenesis in the luteal phase, may provide for a smaller, but more homogenous cohort of follicles available for exogenous stimulation and recovery.\r"

Early pregnancy wastage showed a similar pattern among the four groups and, overall, 67% of pregnancies advanced beyond 20 weeks.\r"

In men with sperm concentrations less than 20 X 10(6)/ml, major discrepancies existed between both methods for sperm concentration. In many instances, debris could not be distinguished from normal sperm by the computerized system. This caused an overestimation of sperm concentration and led to a reduction of motility estimates. As a consequence, frequency distribution of motility, expressed as the percentage of motile sperm, differed to a major extent in both systems.\r"

A significant reduction in carnitine uptake by caput sperm was observed in the presence of HSP from normal subjects, but not from three subjects with reduced motility. A factor has been isolated from HSP that inhibits carnitine uptake by caput sperm and has the following properties: it is nondialyzable, stable to freeze-thawing, soluble in 60% ammonium sulfate, and has an approximate molecular weight of 158 kd. These data are consistent with the existence of a relatively high molecular weight protein in HSP responsible for the preservation of carnitine concentrations in sperm.\r"

Substantial summer deterioration in semen quality was likely to occur only among men whose work places were probably not air-conditioned. These findings suggest that the deleterious effects of summer heat on spermatogenic cells or on epididymal spermatozoa may reduce male fertility and account, at least partially, for the deficit of spring births in warm climates throughout the world.\r"

In this article, we evaluate the probable effects of this regimen on mortality from endometrial cancer as well as mortality from other chronic diseases. We conclude from this analysis that ERT is to be preferred to combination therapy for postmenopausal women without a uterus, primarily because it is predicted that ERT confers a significantly greater benefit on heart disease risk. In women with a uterus, if progestogens are to be prescribed, they should be given in the lowest possible dose needed to achieve the desired histologic changes in the endometrium, since the predicted loss in heart disease benefit from adding the progestogen is substantial.\r"

Mouse laminin was incubated in vitro with 500 mM glucose, and the level of nonenzymatically glycosylated amino acids increased 2-, 6.2-, and 12-fold after incubation for 1, 3, and 12 days, respectively. Ligand binding assays conducted in solution with varying concentrations of [3H]heparin and a constant amount of control or nonenzymatically glycosylated laminin showed a reduction in heparin binding proportional to laminin glycosylation. An analysis of the stoichiometry of [3H]heparin binding to control and nonenzymatically glycosylated laminin at saturating levels of heparin was performed. The results indicated that the total number of heparin binding sites on laminin decreased 4.7- and 14.7-fold due to nonenzymatic glycosylation of laminin for 1 and 3 days, respectively. [3H]heparin binding to 12-day nonenzymatically glycosylated laminin was abolished. Scatchard analyses of the binding data for heparin and laminin gave a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.4 X 10(-8) M. The data for nonenzymatic glycosylation of laminin for 1 day in vitro resulted in a biphasic heparin binding curve. Both high- and low-affinity binding was observed (Kd values of 3.3 x 10(-8) and 2.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively). Similar high- and low-affinity binding sites were seen on 3-day nonenzymatically glycosylated laminin (Kd values of 2.1 x 10(-8) and 3.9 x 10(-7) M, respectively). [3H]heparin binding at a fixed concentration to a constant amount of control or 12-day nonenzymatically glycosylated laminin and type IV collagen was also studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Glucose-intolerant BB rats and diabetes-prone BB rats who did not develop diabetes showed a normal AM function compared to non-diabetes-prone BB rats.

Confirmation of the identities of HTGL and LPL was provided by inhibitory antisera. Preheparin LPL activity was absent in plasma from a patient with type I hyperlipoproteinemia. Both preheparin HTGL and LPL activities correlated with the respective activities measured in plasma obtained 15 min after intravenous injection of heparin (rs = + .774 and + .685, respectively; n = 12). Evidence for the metabolic regulation of preheparin lipases was provided by measurement of significant increases in LPL and HTGL activities after oral glucose ingestion. Overall, preheparin plasma HTGL and LPL activities may reflect ongoing lipoprotein lipolytic activity in tissue beds, and because these measurements do not require the administration of intravenous heparin, they should prove useful for additional studies of short-term regulation of the lipases.\r"

The molecular weight of the insulin receptor on the transformed lymphocytes from the patients was 210,000 and could not be dissociated to alpha- and beta-subunits by dithiothreitol treatment. However, the proreceptor was cleaved by trypsin, and this led to production of a 135,000-Mr alpha-subunit. Insulin binding to the trypsin-treated cells increased to the normal level, and insulin action was normalized. These results suggest that the failure of proreceptor cleavage produces hormone-resistant states and that a proreceptor syndrome may be a unique disease entity for hormone resistance.\r"

Patients seen for well-care visits reported that residents screened most often for smoking and alcohol abuse. Residents inquired about stress, sedentary life-style, poor nutritional habits, and obesity less often. Few patients were counseled to reduce risks, even when unhealthy behaviors had been identified. Residents provided counseling most often for obesity, smoking, and stress; sedentary life-style, poor nutritional habits, and alcohol abuse rarely received intervention. Chart documentation of screening reported by patients was done a majority of the time only for smoking and alcohol abuse. Counseling was usually not documented. Residents screened most often for those risk factors (smoking and alcohol) they considered the most important causes of chronic disease. No relationship was found, however, between resident attitudes and likelihood of counseling. Residents agreed they needed more training to counsel patients on reducing behavioral risks.\r"

Analysis of physician and practice descriptive data obtained by survey from the Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians Research Network, a representative sample of family physicians in Minnesota, leads to these conclusions: (1) Most (87.3%) of the study physicians have on-site x-ray facilities. (2) An extensive variety of x-rays is obtained in the office. (3) Most (54.2%) family physicians interpret their own x-rays and self-select those they want re-read by a radiologist; 43.8% referred all x-rays to a radiologist. (4) Of those who self-select x-rays for referral, 68.9% refer 10% or fewer films. (5) Reasons for referral are: (a) to follow an \"a priori\" decision, (b) to make a diagnosis when clinical findings are inconclusive, (c) to confirm the physician's own clinical diagnosis, (d) to protect from medical-legal problems, and (e) to consult because of the seriousness of the problem. The study physicians also believe that the interpretation of office x-rays is a basic skill of the family physician, that residents should be trained to interpret 90% or more of their office x-rays, and that radiologists should be used as consultants on the basis of identified need similar to the way other consultants are used. The study also showed that decision criteria for referral are based on sound clinical and quality of care issues, that liability concerns have a definite influence on referral rates for x-ray interpretation, and that a contractual reading arrangement with a radiologist and close proximity to a radiologist both tend to increase his or her use.\r"

In order to determine whether or not the timing of the required clinical clerkship was also related to family practice residency selection, a study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between the required third-year family practice clerkship and family practice career choice. The results showed that students who attended medical schools with a required third-year clerkship in family practice were significantly more likely to enter family practice residency training (16.8%), than students who attended schools with a required fourth-year clerkship (14.5% P less than 0.05), or who attended a school with no required family practice clerkship (12.1%, P less than 0.001). These results support the recommendations of the STFM Task Force on Predoctoral Education that a required third-year clerkship in family practice is important in medical student career choice.\r"

Lower maternal scores of family function were significantly associated with higher rates of physician visits for infant respiratory illness and otitis media during the first 15 months of life. This correlation persisted when controlled for breast feeding. Maternal perceptions of family function, including those tested antenatally, may be useful in identifying infants in similar populations who are at risk for increased frequency of visits to the family physician for respiratory illness and otitis media.\r"

Family medicine practice uses connected knowing to discover, through empathy, what another person may be experiencing; in contrast, family medicine research, in order to gain academic credibility, relies on separate knowing, typical of scientific thinking. These two ways of knowing have been variously described by Bruner as paradigmatic vs. narrative, by Kuzel as rationalistic vs. naturalistic, and by Stephens as seeing vs. hearing. The two ways of knowing vary in their use of context, time span, believability, and empathy. Family medicine, in a parallel with women who are finding their voice in a world which has not respected them, must come to blend the two ways of knowing. We can begin reframing our research questions by drawing on knowledge of our intimate, long-term connections with patients, thus underscoring the importance of the knower and the relationship with the known.\r"

Forty-two consecutive patients with weight loss and obstructive symptoms from an unresectable, malignant esophageal stricture were referred for endoscopic palliation. Fourteen patients did not meet the criteria for YAG laser or BICAP tumor probe treatment and other therapies were recommended. Twenty-eight patients were treated, the first 14 with low-power YAG laser and the last 14 with BICAP tumor probe. All patients had coagulation of malignant strictures in one session. Treated patients were similar in background variables and stricture lengths but twice as much thermal energy was needed for the YAG laser as the BICAP tumor probe treatment. Treatment results were not statistically different during the median follow-up and survival of 16 wk. As minor complications, either pain or edema requiring dilatation was more common in the YAG laser-treated group than the BICAP tumor probe group. Treatment-related esophageal strictures developed in 21% of patients treated with YAG laser. A fistula developed in 1 patient with noncircumferential cancer in the BICAP tumor probe group. Compared with only the intake of liquids before treatment, 86% of patients could eat a soft or solid diet after initial treatment with BICAP tumor probe or YAG laser. Our conclusions were that for BICAP tumor probe and YAG laser, endoscopic palliation efficacy and safety for circumferential esophageal cancer strictures were similar. The advantages of using the BICAP tumor probe were portability, lower equipment costs, and the ability to treat submucosal, long, or high esophageal cancer strictures in one session. Treatment with YAG laser was safer than BICAP tumor probe for exophytic, noncircumferential cancers because the laser could be directed endoscopically. Use of the BICAP tumor probe is not recommended for noncircumferential esophagogastric cancer strictures.\r"

Studies were carried out under fasting conditions and after ingestion of 300 ml of chocolate milk, using a unique 11-channel intraluminal probe that incorporated a sleeve sensor positioned across the pylorus and pH electrodes situated in the terminal antrum and proximal duodenum. The most common motor pattern recorded under fasting conditions consisted of regular coordinated contractions, most of which (a) involved the antrum and duodenum, (b) showed evidence of propagation through two or more adjacent channels, and (c) were associated with transient reductions in duodenal pH and transient elevations in antral pH. Ingestion of milk changed the motor pattern to one that was composed of pressure waves, which were confined to the pylorus with few or no pressure waves in the terminal antrum or proximal duodenum. Isolated pyloric pressure waves were gradually replaced by propagated antroduodenal contractions, which eventually occurred at a regular frequency that was higher than that observed under fasting conditions. After ingestion of milk, only the coordinated contractions were associated with transient reductions in duodenal pH. Isolated pyloric pressure waves were also observed under fasting conditions just before or just after phase III of the migrating motor complex, and 17% of these were accompanied by episodes of duodenal acidification.\r"

The onset of solid emptying was associated with an increase in the rate of occurrence of antral pressure waves (p less than 0.05), and the half-time for solid emptying (t1/2 - lag period) was inversely correlated (p less than 0.05) with the rate of coordinated contractions involving the antrum. The substitution of 25% dextrose in normal saline as the liquid component of the meal increased the half-time for liquid emptying from a median of 8 to 40 min (p less than 0.01), increased the lag period for solid emptying from 40 to 87 min (p less than 0.01), and increased the rate of occurrence of isolated pyloric pressure waves during the solid lag phase from 7 to 58/h (p less than 0.05), but did not affect the slope of solid emptying or the rate of coordinated contractions involving the antrum during the solid emptying period.\r"

For example, the rate of gastric acid secretion is directly affected by the nerves of the greater curvature of the stomach. Specifically, acid secretion decreases abruptly after division of the gastroepiploic nerve(s). To determine whether efferent vagus nerve fibers are contained in the gastroepiploic nerve(s), horseradish peroxidase, a protein that undergoes retrograde axonal transport, was applied to these nerves; the brainstem locus of the nuclei of the vagus nerves was examined 2 days later. Typical peroxidase labeling was observed in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve in 5 of 6 rats and 3 of 3 ferrets; the hypothesis that efferent vagus nerves enter the greater curvature of the stomach was thus supported in two vertebrate species. These previously unrecognized nerves should be considered in the interpretation of experimental and clinical phenomena.\r"

The present study was undertaken in 26 healthy subjects to identify the size of spheres that would empty from the stomach with food and to determine whether different meals alter this size. Spheres of predefined sizes were labeled with 113mIn or 99mTc. Using a gamma-camera, we studied the concurrent gastric emptying of spheres labeled with 113mIn and of chicken liver labeled with 99mTc in 100-g, 154-kcal or 420-g, 919-kcal meals, or the concurrent emptying of 1-mm vs. larger spheres. One-millimeter spheres emptied consistently (p less than 0.01, paired t-test) faster than 2.4- or 3.2-mm spheres when ingested together with either the 420- or 100-g meals. Thus, in the 1-3-mm range of diameters, sphere size was a more important determinant of sphere emptying than meal size. Statistical analyses indicated that spheres 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm in diameter with a density of 1 empty at the same rate as 99mTc-liver. Our data indicate some commercially marketed microspheres of pancreatin will empty too slowly to be effective in digestion of food.\r"

Forty percent of patients demonstrated an initial objective response (greater than or equal to 25% decrease in tumor size with no new lesions) and 60% failed chemotherapy (greater than or equal to 25% increase in tumor size or appearance of new lesions). The mean dose of streptozotocin was 27 g/m2 with objective responses occurring at 3.7 +/- 0.7 mo and failures at 4.5 +/- 0.7 mo. Responses lasted 9.7 +/- 2.8 cycles and no complete responses occurred. Survival was not significantly different in responders versus nonresponders (26 +/- 11 vs. 15 +/- 4.8 mo, p greater than 0.1). Changes in serum gastrin concentration, basal acid output, or sensitivity to a given dose of histamine H2-receptor antagonist did not reflect changes in tumor size. Computed tomography and angiography were the best methods to assess changes in tumor size during chemotherapy, whereas liver-spleen scan and ultrasound were relatively insensitive. All patients developed side effects with chemotherapy: 100% had vomiting, 80% alopecia, 40% transient proteinuria, and 20% leukopenia. The present results indicate that chemotherapy with streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil, and adriamycin is much less effective in patients with extensive metastatic gastrinoma than previously reported. Computed tomography scanning is the method of choice to assess changes in tumor size. Changes in serum gastrin concentration, acid secretion, or tumor size assessed by liver-spleen scan or ultrasound are not sensitive indicators of the tumor response during chemotherapy.\r"

In a crossover, double-blind fashion, two groups of 6 normal volunteers were studied using colonic transit scintigraphy during the administration of a test drug or control. The test drugs were morphine (0.1 mg/kg every 6 h s.c.) or naloxone (0.8 mg every 6 h s.c.); control was saline (1 ml every 6 h s.c.). Morphine significantly delayed transit in the cecum and ascending colon (p less than 0.05), slowed the progression of the geometric center (p less than 0.01), and decreased the number of bowel movements per 48 h (p less than 0.005). Naloxone accelerated transit in the transverse colon and rectosigmoid colon (p less than 0.05) and accelerated the progression of the geometric center (p less than 0.05), but had no effect on the number of bowel movements per 48 h (p greater than 0.05). These results suggest that narcotic analgesics may cause constipation in part by slowing colonic transit in the proximal colon and by inhibiting defecation. Acceleration of transit by naloxone suggests that endogenous opiate peptides may play an inhibitory role in the regulation of human colonic transit.\r"

Changes in membrane potential elicited by field stimulation (0.03-32 Hz) and by exogenously applied adenosine triphosphate (10-1000 microM) and noradrenaline (0.03-10 microM) were measured. Nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory junction potentials were the predominant response to field stimulation. However, in some preparations from both diabetic and control tissues, the inhibitory junction potential was preceded by a small nonadrenergic, noncholinergic excitatory junction potential. In nonatropinized preparations, a cholinergic excitatory junction potential was occasionally elicited; there was no difference between these cholinergic responses in diabetic and control tissues. The inhibitory junction potentials and the hyperpolarization in response to adenosine triphosphate were similar in diabetic and control tissues, although the rate of hyperpolarization of the single inhibitory junction potential was slower in the diabetic tissues. In contrast, exogenous application of noradrenaline revealed significantly greater hyperpolarizing responses in diabetic compared with control tissues. This increase in potency appeared to be due, in part, to an increased sensitivity of alpha-adrenoceptors on smooth muscle. There was no evidence for beta-adrenoceptor activation by noradrenaline. Prejunctional inhibition of the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neuromuscular transmission by noradrenaline was not affected by streptozocin-induced diabetes. The induced changes in adrenoceptor activity were selective for the postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors.\r"

  ".W": "Morphologic and physiologic experiments in rodents have demonstrated differences between jejunal and ileal fat absorption. Compared with the rat jejunum, absorbed lipid particles within rat ileal absorptive cells are larger and exit at a slower rate. To evaluate the relevance of these observations to humans, we studied jejunal and ileal ultrastructure in 3 volunteers, each of whom had an intact small intestine and an ileostomy postcolectomy for ulcerative colitis. Proximal jejunal biopsy specimens were obtained via a hydraulic tube after an overnight fast and again after a 20-min intrajejunal lipid infusion. On a separate day, terminal ileal biopsy specimens were taken via the stoma with a small steerable suction biopsy tube after an overnight fast and again after a 20-min intraileal infusion of the same lipid mixture. One volunteer underwent biopsy after a 60-min ileal infusion of a digested meal of higher lipid content. Electron microscopy of fasting human jejunal absorptive cells revealed obvious smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the extreme apical region beneath the terminal web; very low density lipoprotein particles were observed within smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi cisternae. In contrast, fasting human ileal absorptive cells contained less apical smooth endoplasmic reticulum and fewer or no very low density lipoprotein particles. After the 20-min infusion of lower-lipid content, human jejunal and ileal absorptive cells were indistinguishable because they contained fat particles of the same size and number within smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi cisternae, and extracellular spaces. After the 60-min ileal infusion of higher-lipid content, human ileal absorptive cells appeared to be the same as those of the human jejunum after similar lipid infusions. Our observations of the ultrastructural similarity in human jejunal and ileal absorptive cells after lipid infusions contrasts with those in rodents and may reflect species-specific differences in mechanisms of fat absorption.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the safety and efficacy of delayed-release mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) as maintenance treatment for patients with ulcerative colitis, 100 patients with quiescent colitis were randomly grouped to receive either delayed-release mesalazine or an equivalent dose of enteric-coated sulfasalazine in a 48-wk trial. Groups were comparable for age, sex, and duration and extent of disease. Relapse rates at 48 wk were as follows: sulfasalazine 38.6% (95% confidence limits, 24%-54%) and mesalazine 37.5% (95% confidence limits, 24%-53%), chi 2 = 0.01, p greater than 0.90. Mean time to relapse, cumulative relapse rate, and relapse severity were similar in the two groups. Headaches and upper gastrointestinal symptoms--common at trial entry--improved to a greater extent in patients receiving mesalazine. Delayed-release mesalazine is an effective treatment for maintaining ulcerative colitis remission and is associated with fewer side effects than equivalent doses of enteric-coated sulfasalazine.\r"

Grown in the absence of glucose, these cells formed homogeneous epithelial monolayers of columnar cells with typical goblet cell morphology. Differentiation occurred on uncoated glass; laminin, fibronectin, or collagen type I or IV did not enhance differentiation. HT29-18N2 cells grown on uncoated or matrix-coated permeable filters formed differentiated monolayers, but mucin granules within some of these cells polarized along intraepithelial lumens. Polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human colonic mucin, and also a monoclonal antibody against a protease-sensitive epitope of human colonic mucin, stained secretory granules of all differentiated goblet cells within N2 cell monolayers but did not stain predifferentiated goblet cells lacking large secretory granules. Monoclonal antibodies against specific carbohydrate sequences of human mucins also failed to stain N2 cells before differentiation, but recognized varying fractions of differentiated N2 goblet cells. Autoradiographic visualization of radiolabeled glycoproteins demonstrated transport and secretion of N2 cell mucin granules. Cholinergic stimulation of differentiated N2 cell monolayers resulted in depletion of intracellular mucin granules.\r"

Therefore, we attempted to determine whether a specific serum antibody response to mycobacteria occurs in patients with the disease. We tested sera of patients with active Crohn's disease and several control groups in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reactivity with two mycobacterial antigens: (a) lipoarabinomannan, a highly immunogenic somatic lipopolysaccharide present in the cell walls of all species of the Mycobacterium genus, and (b) a protoplasmic antigenic preparation from M. sp strain linda, the mycobacterium that has been specifically implicated in Crohn's disease. We found no significant elevation in immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, or immunoglobulin M antibody levels to these two antigen preparations in the Crohn's disease patients. Moreover, no subset of patients (sex, age, Crohn's disease activity index, location of disease, duration of disease, operations, or response to treatment) had elevated antibody levels. As virtually all known chronic infectious diseases have an associated serologic response to the etiologic agent, our findings greatly diminish the likelihood that Crohn's disease is caused by an infection with a mycobacterium.\r"

Our previous studies have shown that the development of ischemic necrosis was not due to thrombus formation, but to release of vasoconstricting mediators from the intestinal tissue, such as leukotriene C4. However the release of leukotriene C4 was transient and could not account for the prolonged intestinal vasoconstriction. In the present study, we show that (a) the release of norepinephrine from intestinal tissue was increased after injection of platelet-activating factor, and was responsible, at least in part, for the prolonged vasoconstriction; (b) in vivo treatment with reserpine abolished both the prolonged vasoconstriction and the release of norepinephrine from the perfused small intestine; (c) the release of norepinephrine was largely secondary to leukotriene C4 production and direct injection of leukotriene C4 caused catecholamine release; and (d) there was a concomitant release of epinephrine (of a lesser magnitude) after injection of platelet-activating factor.\r"

  ".U": "88196764\r", 
  ".W": "Aminooligopeptidase is an intrinsic glycoprotein of the brush border membrane important for hydrolysis of the oligopeptide products of intraluminal protein digestion. To study its synthesis and intracellular processing, we performed pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine to label proteins of cultured human intestinal explants obtained by endoscopic biopsy. Aminooligopeptidase was isolated by immune precipitation with a monoclonal antibody and its molecular size was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. A precursor of relative molecular weight (Mr) 127,000 appeared within 10 min of chase and appeared to begin conversion to an Mr 150,000 form (the size of brush border membrane aminooligopeptidase) within 60 min. To determine if the change in molecular size was the consequence of alterations in glycosylation, we studied the susceptibility of the two forms to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, which cleaves immature high-mannose N-linked carbohydrate chains, and to peptide: N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, which cleaves both the high-mannose and complex N-linked carbohydrate chains. Only the early Mr 127,000 aminooligopeptidase was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, suggesting that the larger form results from trimming of high-mannose cores and adding terminal sugars in the Golgi complex. Both forms were sensitive to peptide: N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, generating an Mr 114,000 species. The kinetics of the synthesis and processing of aminooligopeptidase and sucrase-isomaltase were compared by immunoprecipitation of both proteins from the same tissue after separating the microvillous membrane from the remainder of the cellular membranes. Labeled aminooligopeptidase was present intracellularly in its mature form within 60 min and was detected exclusively in the brush border membrane by 90 min. Most of the labeled sucrase-isomaltase pool had not yet undergone complex glycosylation during the same period. These data demonstrate that although human intestinal aminooligopeptidase undergoes N-linked glycosylation like sucrase-isomaltase, the synthesis of aminooligopeptidase differs from that of sucrase-isomaltase in respect to the absence of a high-molecular-weight precursor and more rapid pre-Golgi processing.\r"

We have extended our previous studies of the IgA receptor in the liver of the aging Fischer rat to include the small intestine. Basolateral membrane-enriched fractions prepared from rat small intestinal enterocytes exhibit a single binding site for dimeric IgA. This receptor is specific for molecules that interact with rat secretory component, e.g., rat dimeric IgA and IgM and human polymeric IgA but not human monomeric IgA or rat secretory IgA. Inhibition of binding by rabbit-antirat secretory component also indicated that binding is specific for secretory component. Both liver and intestinal membranes showed virtually identical binding specificity. Membranes from crypt cells show increased IgA binding (320 fmol bound per milligram protein) compared with villous cells (105 fmol bound per milligram protein); however, other than increased binding, crypt cells show the same binding characteristics as villous cells. In contrast to our previous findings, in which liver plasma membranes from old rats showed a four-fold decrease in IgA binding compared with young adult rats, membrane fractions from rat enterocytes showed no alterations in dimeric IgA binding with increased age.\r"

In conscious dogs that were prepared with strain-gauge force transducers implanted in the gallbladder wall, peptide YY (400 ng/kg, bolus; 800 pmol/kg.h, infusion) did not affect the resting contractile pattern of the gallbladder, nor did it inhibit cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated gallbladder contraction. In contrast, the cholecystokinin antagonist proglumide (5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg), given in vivo, inhibited CCK-8-stimulated gallbladder contraction in a dose-related manner. The highest dose of proglumide (80 mg/kg) completely abolished contraction of the gallbladder stimulated by CCK-8. In vitro studies showed that peptide YY (0.25, 0.5, or 1 microgram/ml) did not affect the resting tension of rabbit gallbladder strips, and it did not inhibit CCK-8-stimulated contraction of gallbladder strips. Proglumide (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 mg/ml) inhibited CCK-8-stimulated tension of gallbladder strips in a dose-related manner. Peptide YY and CCK-8 had no effect on the motility of the canine sphincter of Oddi in vitro, whereas acetylcholine caused contraction and adrenergic agonists caused relaxation. These results suggest that peptide YY and pancreatone (a peptidelike substance, extracted from ileal and colonic mucosa, that inhibits CCK-8-stimulated gallbladder contraction in vivo) do not appear to be identical.\r"

Pancreatic tissue removed from patients with chronic pancreatitis was analyzed for the number and size of nerves, their association with inflammatory infiltrates, and their fine structure. The mean diameter of nerves in these patients was significantly greater than in controls, whereas the mean area of tissue served per nerve was significantly less than in controls. Foci of inflammatory cells, prominent in some specimens, sometimes were associated with nerves and ganglia, but inflammatory foci and neural elements also existed separately. Invasion of nerve tissue by inflammatory cells was observed but was not massive. Ultrastructural changes were detected in nerves. Individual nerve fibers showed evidence of damage, and there was evidence of edema in the nerve bundle. The perineurial sheath was altered so that it no longer provided a barrier between the surrounding connective tissue and the internal neural components. The results of this study indicate that nerves are preferentially retained while parenchyma degenerates and is replaced by fibrosis during chronic pancreatitis, but that they are retained in an altered condition. Increased mean diameters of nerves in chronic pancreatitis argues against pain being caused by constriction due to fibrosis. It is likely that both sensory and motor nerve fibers are affected by this alteration.\r"

OKY 046 inhibited platelet TXA2 production, as expressed by serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2) concentration, by approximately 85% (p less than 0.001 vs. baseline values) and reduced urinary TXB2 excretion by 72% (p less than 0.01). A significant increase of approximately 19% in inulin clearance was observed during the treatment (from 61.0 +/- 8.42 to 72.7 +/- 7.45 ml/min, p less than 0.05), whereas renal blood flow was unchanged (from 408.50 +/- 19.97 to 424.50 +/- 30.84 ml/min). Drug administration did not affect positive sodium balance [sodium excretion was 4.67 +/- 1.22 mEq/day before drug administration and 6.26 +/- 1.05 mEq/day during drug administration (on day 7)], plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, or the urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, or prostaglandin F2 alpha. These results suggest that renal TXA2 synthesis contributes to the regulation of renal hemodynamics in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites and avid sodium retention, but it does not seem to affect sodium balance.\r"

  ".W": "It has recently been shown that repeated large-volume paracentesis associated with intravenous albumin infusion is a rapid, effective, and safe therapy of ascites in cirrhosis. To investigate whether intravenous albumin infusion is necessary in the treatment of cirrhotics with large-volume paracentesis, 105 patients with tense ascites were randomly allocated into two groups. Fifty-two patients (group 1) were treated with paracentesis (4-6 L/day until disappearance of ascites) plus intravenous albumin infusion (40 g after each tap), and 53 (group 2) with paracentesis without albumin infusion. After disappearance of ascites, patients were discharged from the hospital with diuretics. Patients developing tense ascites during follow-up were treated according to their initial schedule. Paracentesis was effective in eliminating the ascites in 50 patients from group 1 and in 48 from group 2, with the duration of the hospital stay being approximately 11 days in both groups. Paracentesis plus intravenous albumin did not induce significant changes in standard renal function tests, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone. In contrast, paracentesis without albumin was associated with a significant increase in blood urea nitrogen, a marked elevation in plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration, and a significant reduction in serum sodium concentration. One patient from group 1 and 11 from group 2 developed renal impairment or severe hyponatremia after treatment, or both (chi 2 = 9.19; p less than 0.01). The development of these complications could not be predicted by clinical and laboratory data before treatment. Although the probability of survival after entry into the study was similar in patients from both groups, a multivariate analysis identified the development of hyponatremia or renal impairment, or both, following the first paracentesis treatment and the occurrence of other complications during the first hospitalization (encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe infection) as being the only independent predictors of mortality. These results indicate that intravenous albumin infusion is important in avoiding renal and electrolyte complications and activation of endogenous vasoactive systems in cirrhotics with ascites who are treated with repeated large-volume paracentesis. The development of such complications may impair survival in these patients.\r"

In geriatric practice, infection is most frequently seen in combination with many other problems. The geriatric presentation is described in which patients may present with an increased dependency upon care providers due to the development of fresh problems like falls, immobility, confusion, incontinence of urine, and fecal impaction with incontinence. It is important to recognize this presentation and not to miss the diagnosis. It is well recognized that pneumonia is the most frequently missed diagnosis in the elderly. An increase in dependency should not be ignored and attributed to old age. The presence of pathophysiological changes and organ involvement, together with fever, raised white count, or elevated ESR, are strongly supportive of a diagnosis of infection. Once identified, the infection can usually be appropriately treated, resulting in significant improvement in multiple geriatric problems which these patients suffer from.\r"

Hemodialysis with cuprophane membranes was associated with a significant (p less than 0.001) fall in the mean leukocyte count during the 1st hour of treatment. The use of polymethylmethacrylate membranes resulted in a more attenuated form of leukopenia and with polyacrylonitrile membranes no change was observed during hemodialysis. Hemodialysis with each membrane caused a comparable, significant (p less than 0.005) increase in serum ACE, independent of the degree of leukopenia but significantly (p less than 0.001) correlated with the increases in serum proteins. We conclude that this increase in serum ACE concentration after hemodialysis does not reflect acute damage of the pulmonary vascular endothelium during treatment and most probably is a result of hemoconcentration. Therefore, serum ACE analysis is not an indicator of dialyzer membrane biocompatibility.\r"

The results obtained suggest that this filter is a prototype of a new generation of hemofilters especially designed for CAVH. Its low resistance permits its use even in patients with severe hypotension. The high blood flows achieved at a given pressure reduce the risk of clotting and increase the ultrafiltration rate. When an average ultrafiltration of 20-25 ml/min is achieved in 24 hours CAVH becomes very efficient, and alternative techniques to increase its efficiency are no longer required.\r"

Parameters in this equation include an estimate of the acid generated by each patient between treatments, an estimate for the dialyzer dialysance for bicarbonate, ultrafiltration rate, blood flow rate and a targeted mid-dialysis plasma bicarbonate concentration of 25 mEq/L. Nine patients were studied over a 35 week period to verify this method of determining each patient's dialysate bicarbonate concentration. Prescribed dialysate bicarbonate concentrations for the nine patients varied from 29 to 38 mEq/L with five patients having a prescribed value of 35 mEq/L. After a baseline period of five weeks, five patients switched from a 37 mEq/L acetate dialysate to their prescribed dialysate bicarbonate concentration. Four patients who had already been on bicarbonate dialysis at a concentration of 35 mEq/L were dialyzed with their prescribed dialysate bicarbonate concentrations. Patients were then followed for a study period of 30 weeks. The prescribed dialysate bicarbonate concentration resulted in more normal acid/base chemistries for both groups of patients. The results also demonstrate that chronic hemodialysis patients require individualization of dialysate bicarbonate concentrations.\r"

The initial 220 ml platelet volume (5.14 +/- 1.23 x 10(11) was divided into two parts. Half was transfused and the other half was stored for 7 days. All cultured units were negative for bacterial contamination. Mean counts for fresh and stored platelets were respectively 2.34 +/- 0.59 and 2.17 +/- 0.50 X 10(11)/100 ml of PCs (mean recovery 88.7 +/- 11.9%). The pO2 levels were maintained during storage (179.9 +/- 30.5 mmHg) but pCO2, pH, LDH, osmolality, glucose consumption, bicarbonates, ATP, and osmotic stress values changed significantly after 7 days storage. From a clinical point of view, in 14 patients receiving a total of 38 PC transfusions no statistically significant change in corrected post-transfusional levels was observed between fresh and stored PC. Biochemical and morphological data and clinical results suggest that PCs collected with CS-3000 blood cell separator in a closed system and stored for 7 days in polyolefin bags (PL-732) can be satisfactorily employed in clinical practice.\r"

The reduction in volume was 73.3 +/- 8.5% and nucleated blood cells (NBC) recovery was 87.1 +/- 9.1% of original marrow. Red blood cell (RBC) and platelet (PLT) contamination was reduced 64.5 +/- 10.9% and 41.2 +/- 24.1%, respectively. Clonogenic activity indicated that the NBC fraction was highly enriched in hematopoietic progenitor cells (greater than 100%) as assessed in vitro (CFU-GM). Results were not affected by diagnosis, initial marrow volume or cell count of the BM suspension. We conclude that this is a simple and reproducible method using blood bank, facilities and permits BC preparation from BM without significant loss of hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

To prevent this, it has become common practice to dress the burned ear with mafenide acetate. We have observed six hypersensitivity reactions to the mafenide that occurred following several weeks of continuous use of the drug. The reaction mimics chondritis, causing edematous, erythematous, pruritic ears with a profuse serous exudate. There is no associated fever, systemic signs, or pain on motion of the cartilage. Treatment consists of stopping the mafenide. Recovery occurs within 72 hours. Differentiating between chondritis, with its required surgical and antibiotic treatment, and a hypersensitivity reaction is necessary to avoid further iatrogenic injury.\r"

Seventy-five skeletally immature Sprague-Dawley rats were examined after infliction of full-thickness lower extremity scald burns to assess longitudinal growth, joint integrity, and bone composition. Longitudinal bone growth in the immediate postburn period was depressed. However, with the resumption of feeding and activity, normal growth ensued, unless the epiphyseal cartilage had been damaged by septic extension of the wound. Degenerative joint changes occurred in the burned limbs of six animals. Significant soft tissue contractures and collapse of the supporting subchondral bone were present in each of the affected knee joints. There was no evidence of joint sepsis. Large amounts of periosteal new bone consistently formed along the tibia beneath the burn wound. Sequential injections of fluorescent bone markers demonstrated that the stimulus for new bone formation corresponded with the presence of an open granulating burn wound. No further pathologic new bone formed after the wound had healed fully.\r"

The NK cell activity was observed to be significantly (P less than .0025) suppressed at day 7 postinjury in nontreated burned rats compared with control sham burned animals. Interestingly, in rats treated with silver sulfadiazine twice daily, no suppression in NK cell activity was observed. The application of base cream (without silver sulfadiazine) did not have any significant effect on the NK cell activity in burned rats. The data show that the effect of silver sulfadiazine on NK cell activity may be due to the sulfadiazine component, since the serum levels of sulfadiazine (33.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/dL) were observed to be maximal at day 7 postinjury.\r"

Epithelialization (%mean +/- SEM) on postburn day 8, 16, and 24 of the AVG-treated wounds was 38.72% +/- 2.71%, 60.34% +/- 3.28%, and 92.46% +/- 2.26%, respectively, while that of the AgSD-treated burns was 53.35% +/- 2.65%, 94.84% +/- 2.65%, and 100%, respectively (P less than .001). Contraction of the AVG-wounds was significantly higher than that of the AgSD-treated burns during 24 days of the study (P less than .001). The thickness of the newly formed granulation tissue was higher in the AVG-treated wounds (P less than .001), while the hair follicles count was significantly lower (P less than .001) compared with the AgSD-treated burns. It is concluded that this preparation of Aloe vera gel hindered the healing process of the present burn wound model when compared with 1% silver sulfadiazine cream.\r"

A retrospective study of 180 patients admitted from January 1, 1986, to September 1, 1986, revealed that 51 (28%) of our patients had one or more of these impairments. The impaired and control groups were similar in the size of burn and the proportion of third-degree burns. The impaired group was much more likely to have flame burns and was somewhat older. The impaired patients stayed in the hospital nearly twice as long, had 60% more operations, and were twice as likely to have complications. No difference was seen in the frequency of death.\r"

Its weight should be light to minimize the inertial forces encountered in charging the velocity of paddle movement. Its handle should have a relatively large circumference without digital profiling. These optimal performance parameters have been recently incorporated into a new hydrofitness device that will be commercially available for aquatic exercise programs for strengthening upper extremity muscles.\r"

To study the merits of clear prime also in infants, we did experiments in rabbits with two extracorporeal circuits: one employing traditional venous gravity drainage (priming volume 330 ml) and the other employing vacuum drainage (priming volume 90 ml). The first circuit still had to be primed with blood, whereas the second circuit could be primed with a clear solution. Both circuits were automatically controlled to lighten the task of the perfusionist to operate the CPB safely and accurately. We demonstrated that the clear priming solution in the second circuit eliminates the hemodynamic deterioration caused by blood prime in the first circuit. Studying the effect of various modes of regulation, we showed that automatic control of CPB based on venous return is similar to autoregulation of the heart according to Starling's law, and maintains not only normal hemodynamics, but also an optimal microcirculation.\r"

A total of 17 patients (12 females and 5 males) were identified. The left-to-right shunt ratio averaged 2.7. Fifteen patients had abnormally high systolic (greater than 30 mmHg) or mean (greater than 20 mmHg) pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary arterial resistance was elevated (greater than 1.5 units) in eight. One patient died shortly after surgery (operative mortality, 6%) and major postoperative complications were found in four additional patients (24%). Three months after surgery the effort capacity had improved by at least one class in all survivors. After an average of 8.2 years follow-up 12 patients were alive. Ten of them felt better than preoperatively. Eight agreed to cardiac catheterization. The pulmonary blood flow was markedly decreased in all (means, 5.6 l/min postoperatively, vs 11.2 l/min preoperatively) even though a hemodynamically significant shunt persisted in two patients. The mean pulmonary artery pressure had decreased in all who were hypertensive before operation (mean, 25 mmHg vs 33 mmHg). It had slightly increased in patients who had normal pulmonary pressure preoperatively (mean, 27 mmHg vs 19 mmHg). The pulmonary arterial resistance was higher than before surgery in all except one patient (mean, 2.2 units vs 1.5 units).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Furthermore, in all patients a preoperative arteriogram was available and all patients were carefully interviewed on their sexual functions before and after surgery. It is concluded that PBI is a good parameter of the perfusion pressure of the internal iliac artery, which is a significant factor for erectile function. The urethral pressure profile has no relation to erectile function, but the results indicate that peroperative damage of the sympathetic nerves do have a significant influence on retrograde ejaculation postoperatively.\r"

The vena cava was replaced with one of the grafts (5-16 mm in length) as an interposition graft and the animals were followed for more than 3 months. High patency rates were found during all flow conditions with PTFE-grafts and vein grafts and during normal flow with peritoneal tube grafts.

There were 3 femoral to above-knee popliteal bypasses, 27 femoral to below-knee popliteal bypass grafts, 12 femoral to anterior tibial dorsalis pedis bypass grafts, 10 femoral to posterior tibial bypass grafts and 2 femoral to peroneal in situ bypass grafts. The operative indications were progressive disabling claudication in 8 (15%) and limb salvage in 46 (85%). Eighty-nine percent of the limb salvage patients had 0-1 vessel runoff by arteriogram. Cumulative life table patency of the 54 in situ bypass grafts was 79% at 20 months. One hundred percent of the patients who were operated on for disabling claudication had patent grafts at 20 months. Seventy-eight percent of the limb salvage patients had patent grafts. Fourteen of the limb salvage patients required amputation and of these 14, 10 had patent grafts at the time of amputation. There were 8 deaths in the series. Our results demonstrate that a definite learning curve exists with this technique, however, once established, long-term patency and improved limb salvage statistics can be obtained.\r"

  ".W": "Thoracic outlet syndromes are the result of vascular and/or nerve compression. In order to diagnose these syndromes careful clinical examination and objective testing are required. Vascular compression can be provoked by three well-defined thoracic outlet compression manoeuvres. Changes in vascular pulsation during these manoeuvres can be registered by means of plethysmography of the fingers. For an adequate interpretation of the clinical value of the various techniques of provoking vascular compression, a knowledge is required of the frequency with which vascular compression can be provoked in normal subjects of different age groups. We measured the changes in pulse in normal volunteers in 5-year age groups ranging from 15 to 85. This study showed that vascular compression until zero flow during 120 degrees arm abduction seems to be normal rather than abnormal. Zero flow during Adson manoeuvre and military attitude did not occur frequently in the supine position in normal subjects. Neither the different age groups nor the sexes showed any real differences in the quality of the findings. Therefore, establishing zero flow by means of a costoclavicular compression or scalenic compression is a clinically significant finding, while zero flow during 120 degrees abduction (pectoralis minor compression) is within normal limits.\r"

Considering the low operative mortality, the short operating time, the late results and the high late mortality independent of the surgical procedure, the femorofemoral bypass and in many ways also the axillobifemoral bypass represent suitable and effective methods of operation for high risk patients, whereas unilateral and bilateral axillofemoral grafts showed a high rate of graft thrombosis and poor long term results (Type I and III).\r"

Twenty-two bypasses were performed for vertebrobasilar symptoms or subclavian steal and 10 for upper extremity claudication and/or ischemia. The mean age of the operative group was 66 years, 94% of patients had more than one atherosclerotic risk factor (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, smoking), and 75% had undergone a previous arterial reconstruction operation. There were no operative deaths, and the only postoperative complication was a sterile seroma which responded to aspiration. At late follow-up extending to 11 years, three grafts had thrombosed while another became infected and had to be removed; no limb loss resulted from these graft failures and the actual late patency rate was 87%. Carotid-subclavian bypass, intrathoracic bypasses, and endarterectomy at the site of occlusion have all been suggested for the treatment of symptomatic proximal subclavian artery disease. With axilloaxillary bypass, however, the hazards associated with carotid artery manipulation, operation on the notoriously treacherous subclavian artery, and the morbidity related to thoracotomy in this older, high-risk patient population can be avoided. The axilloaxillary bypass is safe and simple, and the excellent long-term patency rates make it the procedure of choice for symptomatic subclavian artery disease.\r"

Two automatic magnetic clamps alternated the whole blood flow to each artery at a fixed time interval. In this way the blood flow resembled a pulsative one. Through a second pump heparin could be given continuously. The bypass machine was equipped with pressure guards and a bubble detector for safety monitoring. The technical aspects are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the dose-response relationship between thyroid hormone and linear growth, we studied 10 castrated prepubertal cynomolgus monkeys. Hypothyroidism was induced by administration of methimazole (0.0125% in drinking water) and was confirmed by high serum TSH levels (greater than 40 mU/L) in all animals. Subsequently, each animal received 1, 2, 4, or 8 micrograms/kg.day T4, im, for 9 weeks. The sequence of T4 doses was random, and 6 weeks elapsed between successive T4 doses. Serum T4, T3, TSH, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels and lower leg length were measured every 3 weeks. Methimazole administration decreased thyroid hormone and IGF-I levels and lower leg growth rate. With increasing doses of exogenous T4, serum T4, T3, and IGF-I as well as lower leg growth rate increased significantly. Animals not given T4 had a 65% decrease in lower leg growth rate (P less than 0.01). Animals given 4 and 8 micrograms/kg.day T4 had 56% and 73% increases, respectively, in lower leg growth rate compared to baseline (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Lower leg growth rate correlated better with serum T3 (r = 0.50; P less than 0.001) than with serum T4 (r = 0.29; P less than 0.05). Lower leg growth rate also correlated with serum IGF-I levels (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001). Serum IGF-I correlated with serum T3 (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001), but not with serum T4. We conclude that increased serum T4 and T3 levels cause progressive increases in growth velocity and IGF-I levels over a range from moderate hypothyroidism to moderate hyperthyroidism. Growth velocity and IGF-I levels correlated more strongly with the serum T3 than with the serum T4 level.\r"

The lower limits of detection for IGF-I and IGF-II were 0.7 ng/mL (micrograms/L) and 1.2 ng/mL (micrograms/L), respectively. Iodinated IGF added to saliva was not degraded, as assessed by trichloroacetic acid precipitability and placental membrane binding. In saliva from 14 normal subjects, IGF-I was measurable in all. IGF-II was detectable only in 8 of 14 subjects; the mean value in these 8 subjects was 2.6 +/- 0.6 (+/- SE) ng/mL (micrograms/L). The mol wt of salivary IGF was similar to that of free plasma IGF after acid or neutral pH gel chromatography. Human saliva contained no significant IGF-binding protein. Eluates from neutral gel chromatography of concentrated (20-fold) normal saliva did not inhibit IGF-II binding to placental membrane receptors. Eluted proteins from saliva samples subjected to prior acid gel chromatography failed to bind radiolabeled IGF after neutralization. Saliva samples assayed for binding protein using an amniotic fluid binding protein RIA had values at or below the lower limit of detection [less than 0.06 micrograms eq/mL (mgeq/L)]. Salivary IGF-I concentrations did not change with increasing salivary flow rates above normal, with time of day, or with storage at room temperature for up to 24 h before freezing. The mean IGF-I concentration in mixed saliva from 14 normal young adults (8 men) was 2.3 +/- 0.3 (+/- SE) ng/mL (micrograms/L), and their mean plasma IGF-I level was 315 +/- 27 ng/mL (micrograms/L). Mean salivary IGF-I was significantly lower in 15 patients with GH deficiency [1.3 +/- 0.2 ng/mL (micrograms/L); P less than 0.01] and 8-fold higher in 5 acromegalic patients [17.2 +/- 6.3 ng/mL (micrograms/L); P less 0.01]. Removal of their GH adenomas led to a fall in salivary IGF-I to 5.6 +/- 1.3 ng/mL (micrograms/L); P less than 0.05). In summary, saliva contains free IGFs but no significant quantities of specific binding proteins. Salivary IGF-I levels reflect the GH status of the donor.\r"

  ".W": "Human genital skin fibroblasts grown in cell culture contain aromatase activity and glucocorticoid receptors, providing a model for studying the relationship between changes in levels of dexamethasone (DEX) receptor binding and changes in the response of aromatase to DEX. Incubation of cells with media containing DEX produced a time-dependent decline in receptor number, with a nadir at 18-24 h. When DEX was removed from the media, only 40-60% of the lost receptor content was recovered. Binding of DEX to its receptor declined in a dose-dependent fashion after 24-h exposure to this glucocorticoid; the concentration of DEX that produced a half-maximal decline (2.2 nmol/L) was in the same range as the Kd for the receptor-DEX complex (14 nmol/L). Incubation of cells with DEX for 20 h also reduced the level of DEX receptor binding in purified nuclei and nuclear matrix by 76% and 89%, respectively. When subcellular fractions were prepared after incubation of cells with DEX for 1-24 h, whole cell, cytosolic and nuclear DEX receptor binding declined in parallel with time. Incubation of skin fibroblasts with DEX resulted in progressive stimulation of aromatase activity, with a peak at 24 h followed by a return to baseline at 72 h. The initial stimulation of aromatase was mediated by DEX receptors. However, the decline in aromatase activity after prolonged DEX exposure did not appear to be due to a decline in the level of DEX receptor binding. The data supporting this last conclusion included the following. When cells were washed free of DEX after 48 h, DEX receptor binding recovered within 24 h, whereas aromatase activity could not be maximally restimulated until 36 h; when cells were incubated with media containing DEX and cycloheximide for 1-48 h, DEX receptor binding declined to a nadir by 24 h, whereas aromatase activity rose continuously up to 48 h. These findings are consistent with the concept that the aromatase gene in skin fibroblasts is subject to both positive and negative regulation.\r"

The mean S-14 LI content in 24-h collections in men [10.96 +/- 0.91 (+/- SE) pmol/24 h; n = 10; total volume, 1.96 +/- 0.09 L] was not significantly different from that in women (9.09 +/- 0.85 pmol/24 h; n = 10; total volume, 1.87 +/- 0.09 L). Gel chromatography of 24-h urine collections revealed three major peaks of S-14 LI coeluting with S-14, S-28, and a 12,000 mol wt species corresponding to prosomatostatin. HPLC analysis confirmed the presence of S-14, S-28, and the 12,000 mol wt form and additionally revealed a major fourth peak of 3,000 mol wt, closely related to S-28. Immunoreactivity corresponding to [Des,Ala1]S-14 (S-13) was identified by HPLC coelution with synthetic S-13 and reactivity in a centrally, but not N-terminally directed, S-14 RIA. The relative proportions of the different HPLC peaks varied considerably during the 24-h period. S-14 and S-28 were excreted preferentially during the day, whereas the 12,000 and 3,000 mol wt forms were excreted preferentially at night. The ingestion of a mixed meal evoked parallel increases in plasma S-14 LI and urinary S-14 LI excretion in six normal subjects. We conclude that the principal circulating forms of S-14 LI (S-14, S-28, S-13, and pro-S) are present in urine and that the measurement of urinary S-14 LI could provide a reliable index of integrated plasma S-14 LI concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery was performed in 64 patients with Cushing's disease in search of a corticotroph adenoma. In 4 patients, profuse local bleeding prevented completion of the exploration. Of the 60 patients who had an adequate exploration, 4 could not be followed after surgery. Short term assessment of the surgical outcome (3-6 months postoperatively) was performed on 60 patients, including the 4 who had incomplete pituitary exploration. Forty-two patients (70%) were judged as immediate successes [urinary cortisol excretion, less than 90 micrograms (less than 248 nmol)/day]; the mean urinary cortisol excretion and plasma ACTH level fell from 463 +/- 70 (+/- SE) to 26.7 +/- 3.6 micrograms/day (1277 +/- 193 to 74 +/- 10 nmol/day; n = 33) and from 111 +/- 33 to 36 +/- 14 pg/mL (24 +/- 7 to 8 +/- 3 pmol/L; n = 23) in patients who had both measurements pre- and postoperatively. Eighteen patients (30%) were judged as immediate failures; neither urinary cortisol excretion nor plasma ACTH levels changed significantly in patients who had both measurements pre- and postoperatively. The preoperative epidemiological, clinical, hormonal, and radiological characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. Histological examination of pituitary fragments removed in 58 of the 60 patients evaluated postoperatively revealed the presence of tumoral tissue in a higher percentage of patients in the immediate success group (72%) than in the immediate failure group (24%; P less than 0.01). The 42 patients in the immediate success group were followed from 6 months to 7 yr (median, 2 yr); 6 patients had recurrences from 2-3 yr after operation. Actuarial analysis indicates that the probability of a patient remaining well 6 yr after surgery is 72 +/- 20% (95% confidence limit). Most of the patients in the immediate success group had transient ACTH deficiency preceding a progressive return to normal pituitary-adrenal function.\r"

The purposes of this study were to analyze natural killer cell (NK) functional activity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with PPT compared to those in normal nonpostpartum and postpartum women. NK activity and ADCC were determined by specific lysis of 51Cr-labeled K562 human erythroleukemia tumor cells at varying effector (mononuclear cell) to target cell ratios. Nineteen PPT patients between 4-9 months [mean, 6.5 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE)] postpartum were compared to 20 nonpostpartum women, 31 healthy women between 4-9 months (6.7 +/- 0.3) postpartum, and 14 women 2 days after delivery. There were significant differences in the NK functional activities of the 4 groups (F = 7.95; P = 0.0002). The mean NK activities, as measured by percent specific lysis at an effector to target cell ratio of 10:1, were 31.1 +/- 3.3%, 20.9 +/- 2.3%, 22.5 +/- 2.8%, and 11.5 +/- 2.0% in the nonpostpartum, PPT, postpartum, and 2-day postpartum groups, respectively. Specific lysis by ADCC was not significantly different from lysis by NK activity in any group. The PPT, postpartum, and 2-day postpartum groups had significantly lower NK activity compared to that in nonpostpartum women (P less than 0.05). Both the PPT and postpartum women had higher NK activities than the 2-day postpartum women (P less than 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the NK activities of the PPT patients compared to those of the healthy postpartum women. Patients with PPT were also found to have associated autoimmune dysfunction. The PPT group had significantly higher serum antinuclear antibody titers; 8 of 24 patients (33%) had titers of 1:160 or greater compared to only 2 of 29 healthy postpartum women (7.4%; P less than 0.05). Seven of the PPT patients had serum immune complexes, and 3 had TSH receptor antibodies. We conclude that functional NK activity and ADCC in peripheral lymphocytes of PPT patients are not different from those in healthy postpartum women; however, the postpartum women had significantly decreased activity compared to that in nonpostpartum women. These data emphasize the importance of studying healthy postpartum women in investigations of PPT, since the immunological changes in pregnancy and the postpartum period remain largely undefined.\r"

We studied such individuals to define the changes in mineral metabolism and renal responses to PTH that occur in mild renal insufficiency. PTH was infused for 24 h [0.132 microU/kg.(0.475 U/kg.h) synthetic human PTH, 1-34 fragment] before and after uninephrectomy in nine donors. Plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels were lower after uninephrectomy. However, the percent change from the preinfusion baseline was not different before and after uninephrectomy. With loss of a kidney, there was increased per nephron excretion of phosphate, calcium, and magnesium. Although serum carboxy-terminal levels were elevated after uninephrectomy, no changes in endogenous amino-terminal PTH levels were found. However, the levels of infused human PTH-(1-34) were higher after surgery because the MCR was lower. Serum carboxy-terminal PTH levels decreased in parallel with increased whole blood ionized calcium during PTH infusion, indicating appropriate parathyroid gland responsiveness. At this level of renal insufficiency, renal compensatory changes, rather than changes in parathyroid function, are the predominant factors in the maintenance of mineral homeostasis.\r"

There were no differences in current calcium intake between the 2 groups, as assessed by a 7-day food record, but carbohydrate intake (grams per kg BW) was higher in the endurance-trained women (P less than 0.001). Bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine (L1-L3), proximal femur, and radius did not differ between the 2 groups; however, when normalized for body weight, the BMDs of the spine and radius were higher in the endurance-trained than in the sedentary women. Serum estrone and PTH levels were lower, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and somatomedin-C levels were higher in the endurance-trained than in the sedentary women. Serum GH tended to be higher in the endurance-trained than in the sedentary women (P = 0.08), and there was a postexercise increase in serum GH in the endurance-trained, but not in the sedentary, women (P less than 0.01). The major effect of habitual exercise was on body weight and hormone status. Although leanness and low serum estrone levels are risk factors for osteoporosis, these were not associated with lower BMD in endurance-trained women. Endurance-trained women may have improved calcium absorption as a result of higher carbohydrate intake and higher serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels.\r"

To determine whether a similar effect occurs in hypercalcemic patients, ketoconazole (200 mg every 8 h for 7 days) was given to nine patients with confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism, three patients with probable primary hyperparathyroidism who were awaiting surgery, and three patients with mild hypercalcemia of uncertain etiology who were being followed. Ketoconazole administration led to a significant reduction in mean serum 1,25-D levels in the hypercalcemic patients [basal, 64 +/- 7 (+/- SEM) pg/mL (154 +/- 17 pmol/L) vs. 36 +/- 5 pg/mL (86 +/- 12 pmol/L) after ketoconazole; P less than 0.001]. Serum total calcium fell slightly but significantly [basal, 11.05 +/- 0.17 mg/dL (2.76 +/- 0.04 mmol/L) vs. 10.77 +/- 0.16 (2.69 +/- 0.04 mmol/L) after ketoconazole; P less than 0.02], but the falls in total serum calcium and serum 1,25-D after ketoconazole treatment were not correlated with one another. Ketoconazole administration did not alter serum ionized calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, or PTH concentrations or urinary cAMP excretion. The responses to ketoconazole were similar in all three patient subgroups. We conclude that short term administration of ketoconazole to hypercalcemic patients causes a substantial fall in serum 1,25-D and a small fall in total serum calcium. These effects render ketoconazole a potentially useful agent for investigation of the importance of 1,25-D in patients with hypercalcemic disorders and for their treatment.\r"

Most of these monoclonal antibodies had variable degrees of reactivity with eye muscle, orbital connective tissue, thyroid, and extra-thyroid tissue preparations when tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Eight of the MCABs, selected on the basis of their reactivity with human eye muscle or orbital connective tissue antigens, were used to affinity purify orbital membrane antigens. All purified fractions were tested in the ELISA for reactivity with the MCAB used for their purification. Four of the purified antigens with a high reactivity were not proteins. To increase the specificity of the reactivity of serum autoantibodies with affinity-purified antigens, we developed a competitive binding ELISA in which the MCAB-immunoglobulin was directly labeled with alkaline phosphatase. We tested the serum of 24 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, 10 patients with a history of Graves' hyperthyroidism and no eye disease, 14 patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis without eye disease, 8 patients with other nonautoimmune thyroid disorders, and 20 normal subjects for reactivity with an affinity-purified nonprotein orbital antigen. The levels of serum autoantibodies against this antigen in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy were significantly higher than those in normal subjects or patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism with no eye disease. Although unlikely to be of primary pathogenetic significance, it is possible that levels of this antibody in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy may reflect the extent of orbital inflammation and, therefore, be useful as a clinical marker.\r"

Before veralipride administration, the naloxone infusion did not alter LH secretion. Chronic administration of veralipride resulted in a significant (P less than 0.01) decline in plasma LH levels. In addition, the naloxone infusion induced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in plasma LH levels, which reached values similar to those before veralipride administration. These results demonstrate that in postmenopausal women the antidopaminergic drug veralipride can restore, at least in part, the activity of the endogenous opioid system. These findings suggest that endogenous opioid peptides may mediate the inhibitory effect exerted by chronic antidopaminergic drug administration on LH secretion in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid glands from six 8- to 10-week-old fetuses obtained at the time of legal abortion were cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen and transplanted into nude nu/nu mice. Histological and autoradiographic studies of the grafts labeled with [3H]thymidine and [125I]iodine showed proliferation and functional differentiation of the fetal thyroid tissue. Despite T4-mediated suppression of host TSH secretion, up to 36% of the follicular cell nuclei incorporated the thymidine label, reflecting autonomous proliferation, while iodine organification was almost entirely obliterated. Methimazole-induced TSH hypersecretion readily stimulated both growth and function of the transplanted tissue. Thus, during early development, the human thyroid largely depends on TSH for function, but not for growth. Similar findings were obtained in newborn mice, in whom 58% of the thyroid follicular cells proliferated autonomously, i.e. in the absence of TSH. The number of autonomously proliferating cells gradually declined with increasing age to about 1% in 60-day-old animals and, as reported previously, in xenotransplanted normal human thyroid tissue, whereas the number of autonomously proliferating cells was previously found to be several times higher in xenotransplanted human multinodular goiters. We, therefore, hypothesize that the rapidly and autonomously replicating cells that initiate nodule formation in human multinodular goiters reflect the persistence in the adult gland of cells with fetal growth potential.\r"

PMN adherence was in excess of the maximum value detected for healthy subjects in 14 of 25 patients with Crohn's disease and two of 10 with proctocolitis, but it was within the normal range for all eight with anorexia nervosa. High adherence in Crohn's disease, however, was not associated with quantitative or qualitative changes of PMN populations, absolute concentrations of C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, disease severity, drug regimens, malnutrition, or zinc deficiency. High PMN adherence in Crohn's disease may therefore reflect the activation in vivo of normal PMN by humoral factors.\r"

Cryostat sections from the biopsy samples were stained using monoclonal antibodies to T6, a Langerhans' cell marker, and to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens (HLA-DP, DQ, and DR). Epithelial Langerhans' cells were reduced in number and showed changed morphology and distribution in koilocytic lesions and in all grades of CIN (p less than 0.01) except CIN I. HLA-DR expression by Langerhans' cells was significantly increased in koilocytic lesions and in CIN grades I and II (p less than 0.05); HLA-DQ expression was significantly increased in all grades of CIN (p less than 0.05) with the increase being most pronounced in CIN I (p less than 0.01). Columnar epithelium expressed MHC class II antigens in all samples tested and squamous epithelium in four of 29 cases of CIN III.

Histological investigation confirmed that it was impossible to distinguish the groups on this basis. Molecular virology using both dot blot and Southern transfer techniques showed that 10 cases carried the HPV type 6 genome, three cases HPV type 11, and in one case no HPV DNA was detected. All six adult onset cases carried HPV 6 sequences while the juvenile onset group comprised four HPV 6 and three HPV 11 cases. In the juvenile onset group more females were affected; in the adult onset group more males were affected. Two of the patients shown to have HPV type 11 sequences in their biopsy material were the most resistant to treatment. One of the adult onset cases subsequently developed a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx in which HPV 6 DNA was detected.

  ".W": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cervical carcinoma was investigated using in situ DNA-DNA hybridisation on histological sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue to assess the technique's sensitivity and to assess retrospectively the association between HPV16 and invasive cervical carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected in 16 of 33 biopsy specimens of CIN. Cells containing viral DNA were more numerous than those positive for viral structural proteins. HPV DNA was also present in less differentiated cells deeper in the epithelium. The detection rate in CIN was lower than that reported for other hybridisation techniques such as Southern blotting. In a retrospective study of biopsy specimens of invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix HPV16 DNA, the virus most commonly associated with cervical malignant disease, was found in 20 of 25 cases, including those dating from as far back as 1932. The level of sensitivity was similar to that reported for other hybridisation techniques. DNA positive cells were focally distributed in the invasive tumours, and most tumour cells were negative for viral DNA, a result consistent with the low copy number found in malignant cells. It is concluded that HPV16 is not a new virus but that its prevalence is a result of changes in sexual behaviour and that in situ hybridisation is useful in the localisation of HPV DNA replication in CIN and invasive carcinoma.\r"

A smear was prepared from each sample for Papanicolaou staining and for cytological examination for evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The cells remaining on the spatula were harvested for DNA analysis. These samples were probed for HPV 6, 16, and 18 and the results of DNA hybridisation and cytology were compared. Cytological changes of HPV (anucleate keratinised and keratinised squamous cells, koilocytic change and dyskeratosis, or multinucleation, or both) were detected in 103 (72%) of the samples where HPV DNA was detected; koilocytic changes were present in only 67 (48%). It is concluded that screening for a range of viral changes is a more sensitive method of detecting HPV infection than screening for koilocytic change alone.\r"

Nearly all pure mucinous carcinomas had a normal DNA stemline (25 of 26) with only one aneuploid tumour. Mixed mucinous carcinomas had a DNA content resembling that of common ductal carcinoma with 11 aneuploid tumours. Aneuploid tumours tended to be of higher grade and stage than diploid tumours. The survival of patients with pure mucinous carcinoma was better than that of patients with mixed mucinous carcinoma. Mucinous carcinoma should be classified as such only if it is a pure mucinous carcinoma.\r"

The epithelial cells stained with Con A, WGA, UEA I and RCA, although the intensity of the staining was generally higher in the malignant tumours.

Blacks were 70% more likely to have markers than whites. This racial difference was not explained by job status or patient contact. Our data suggest that work in a district general hospital does not constitute a clinically important hazard for hepatitis B infection. Because of the high cost of the vaccine, additional studies to assess the risk of hospital work in other settings in Zimbabwe are required before health policy regarding routine hepatitis B vaccination is determined.\r"

RFF-VII/1 and RFF-VII/2 were used in a one step, double monoclonal immunoradiometric assay for VII:Ag. This was highly reproducible and detected as little as 0.05U/dl VII:Ag. Values for VII:Ag obtained for plasma samples from normal subjects (n = 20), patients with liver disease (n = 20), patients treated with warfarin (n = 20), and those congenitally deficient in factor VII (n = 7) correlated very well (r = 0.96) with data obtained in a radioimmunoassay using polyclonal rabbit antiserum to factor VII.

Reasons for refusal were most commonly related to a negative perception of the health care system or a passive acceptance of death. Refusers were significantly less ill than acceptors and did not change in health or functional status at follow-up. The results suggest that refusal of hospitalization is most often related to interaction with the health care system and that less ill patients may have reasonable outcomes when treated at home.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the Jelliffe and the Cockcroft and Gault methods of estimating creatinine clearance in elderly nursing home patients (65 years) with chronic indwelling urethral catheters. Although these relationships have been prospectively validated in hospitalized and ambulatory populations previously, we found that they produced poor estimates of creatinine clearance in this patient group. For the Jelliffe method, 11 of 19 estimates were 20% or greater from the measured value; 10 of 11 poor estimates were high. The Cockcroft-Gault method had 10 of 19 estimates 20% or greater from the measured value with 8 of 10 of the poor estimates being high. An altered relationship between body weight, muscle mass, and daily creatinine production is the most likely explanation for the bias in these creatinine-clearance estimations. New estimates of the relationships between age, weight, serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance need to be developed for this population.\r"

In this report we have characterized the life expectancy and pattern of spontaneous deaths in 202 mice, malignant and nonmalignant lesions in 64 male mice dying spontaneously, and organ weights and lesions in 39 male mice killed at selected ages. The maximum age observed was 41.5 months. The principal causes of death were malignant lymphoma and alveologenic neoplasms, which were present in 56.3% and 45.3%, respectively, of the mice dying spontaneously. A variety of other neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions that are not infrequently seen in older mice were observed in these mice. Neoplasms seen in these mice that are rare in other mice included disseminated mast cell tumors in two mice and gastric adenocarcinoma in one mouse. In comparing the diseases observed in this hybrid strain with those reported for the parent strains, there was an incidence of malignant lymphoma similar to the C57BL/6 parent, an incidence of alveologenic neoplasms intermediate between the parent strains, and a markedly reduced incidence of amyloidosis. This study provides a detailed background of baseline hematologic and morphologic data in a long-lived hybrid of two commonly used strains of mice.\r"

All of the younger males mated, with 96% yielding a litter; only 42% of aged males mated, with 65% siring young. There were no statistical differences in the litter sizes, nor any congenital defects noted in offspring from either age group. There was no evidence of aneuploidy in 10-day-old embryos sired from males of either age group. Aged males that failed to mate had lower body weight, a lower hematocrit, hypertrophied adrenal glands and seminal vesicles, decreased fructose levels in seminal vesicle fluid, atrophied testes with fewer sperm that were less motile, lower testosterone levels, and a greater percentage of degenerating epithelium lining seminiferous tubules. The latter group of aged mice, while appearing and acting as vigorous as aged mice that had mated, may have been experiencing disease processes associated with aging which subsequently impaired reproduction.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of newly discovered medical problems and the yield of various diagnostic modalities in such elderly depressed patients. Of 100 depressed geropsychiatric inpatients, the most frequent new diagnoses included: electrolyte abnormalities (6 patients), bacteriuria (13), medication reactions (7), exacerbation of previous thyroid disease (6), new thyroid function abnormalities (3), and renal failure, Parkinson's Disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease (2 each). One patient had a cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and 4 had acute illnesses. A workup including CBC, blood chemistries, urinalysis, and thyroid function tests frequently yielded abnormal results. When used as screening tests, head CT scanning, electroencephalography, and chest radiography did not affect management. We conclude that elderly depressed patients have a high prevalence of undiscovered physical illnesses, but that history, physical examination, and simple laboratory evaluation may be sufficient to guide their workups.\r"

Records were analyzed for adult admissions whose principal diagnosis fell into one of three categories: malignant disease, heart and cerebrovascular disease, and other diseases. In this study, age, disease category, and body mass index were predictors of survival; sex and race were not. Predicted mortality calculated by logistic regression was greatest at the extremes of body weight in all age groups and in each disease category describing a U-shaped relationship. Obesity was associated with higher mortality only when subjects were 100% or more overweight, whereas being at or below ideal weight was usually associated with increased mortality. Lowest mortality occurred at moderate overweight. The deleterious effects of extremes of body weight take on increasing importance the older the age of the patient. Underweight seems to be a more important predictor of mortality than overweight in older hospitalized subjects. The higher mortality in thin patients could not be explained by weight loss between hospitalizations.\r"

Fiber intake increased across the age span (slope = +0.022 +/- 0.003 g/yr, p less than .01). Longitudinal analysis of 380 men, each of whom provided 3-8 diet records over an average period of 8 yr, indicated that the increase in fiber intake occurred in each age group and was not the result of differential survival. Fiber intake was negatively correlated with body mass index. After clinical screening to eliminate variables which could independently influence coronary risk factors, multiple regression analyses including age and body mass index were conducted to examine the effect of fiber (adjusted for total calorie intake) on blood pressure, blood lipids, and glucose tolerance. For systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose, higher fiber intake was associated with lower levels of the risk factors (p less than .05).\r"

Respondents rated the frequency of difficulty they had performing visual tasks such as reading, recognizing objects, picking out a face in a crowd, seeing in dimly lit environments, seeing moving objects, and so on. The surveys revealed five dimensions that declined with increasing age: visual processing speed, light sensitivity, dynamic vision, near vision, and visual search. The percentage of respondents reporting a decline in these visual dimensions increased two- to sixfold across the adult life span. Varying rates of visual decline for different tasks suggest that various aspects of vision age at different rates.\r"
