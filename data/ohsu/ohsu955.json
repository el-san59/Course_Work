  ".W": "The association between living arrangement and dietary quality of older U.S. adults was investigated in 4,402 adults aged 55 years or older who participated in the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, 1977 to 1978. Dietary quality was based on percent of Recommended Dietary Allowances for 3-day intakes of nine nutrients. More men living alone consumed a poor-quality diet than did men living with a spouse, particularly those 75 years or older; for women, this effect was seen only in the 55- to 64-year-old group. In general, more women than men had poor-quality diets. A number of factors (economic, employment, health status, energy intake, body mass index, and nutrient supplement use) were examined for their importance in accounting for differences in dietary quality of older men and women living alone compared with those living with a spouse. Energy intake was the most important variable accounting for the association of living arrangement with dietary quality. Evidence indicated that older adults living alone did not make poorer food choices than those living with a spouse, but rather that they consumed fewer calories.\r"

  ".W": "The validity and reliability of a videotape method for quantifying food intake were tested, and results of the method were compared with results obtained from 24-hour dietary recalls. Participants were 37 elderly Catholic nuns (aged 81.8 +/- 4.1 years) who were ambulatory and living in a retirement home. The videotape method of dietary assessment consisted of videotaping food trays of each participant for three meals during 1 day and the subsequent identification of food types and amounts from the videotapes. Estimates of food amounts obtained were used in the calculation of energy and nutrient intake. Correlation coefficients between values for energy and 14 nutrients obtained by direct measurement of food and estimates from the videotape method were high (r = 0.86 to 1.0). Compared with measured food amounts, the videotape method underestimated food quantities by an average of 6%. The reliability test indicated that mean nutrient values obtained from the videotape method by two research assistants differed by an average of 3.7% and were highly correlated (r = 0.84 to 0.98). Comparison of the videotape method with 24-hour dietary recalls revealed differences between mean values that were greater than 10% for energy and 6 of the 14 nutrients and correlations that ranged from 0.09 to 0.82. These results suggest that use of 24-hour dietary recalls among the elderly may result in a high percentage of error.\r"

Accuracy was determined for kinds of food eaten, size of portions eaten, and content of 15 nutrients. Exact agreement between the two data sources on the kinds of food eaten occurred for only 55% of the observed food items. For 5 of the 10 food groups evaluated, the bias in mean recalled portion-size data was less than 10%. There was evidence of attenuated regression slopes relating recalled to observed portion sizes for 4 of the 10 food groups; adjusted r2 values for the recalled portion sizes ranged from 0.02 to 0.94. Because errors in the recalls of the kinds and amounts eaten tended to go in different directions, the accuracy of the nutrient data was better than that for the food-item or the portion-size data. For 12 of the 15 nutrients evaluated, the bias in mean recalled intake data was less than 10%. Although the adjusted r2 values for the recalled nutrient data ranged from 0.24 to 0.58, there was evidence of attenuated regression slopes relating recalled intake to observed intake for only 5 of the 15 nutrients. We conclude that telephone contact is an acceptable way to obtain short-term dietary recall data from elderly subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that nearly one in five older adults has xerostomia (dry mouth). Salivary gland dysfunction and/or inadequate saliva increases the difficulty of these older adults in obtaining proper nutrition. Problems in lubricating, masticating, tolerating, tasting, and swallowing food contribute notably to the complex physiological and psychological manifestations of aging. To our knowledge, the literature has not demonstrated an association between xerostomia and malnutrition in the elderly. We randomly selected 67 older adults from institutionalized and free-living geriatric populations. Nutritional intake analysis was performed on both groups of study subjects, who were found to have xerostomia by use of sialometry, and on control subjects matched for age, sex, and physical status. Intake of total energy, protein, dietary fiber, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B-6, calcium, iron, and zinc was compared with the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances. Subjects' intakes were also compared with that of a control group. Medical systemic information and number and types of medications were compared among the groups. Statistical analysis of the data indicated significant (p less than .001) inadequacies in the nutritional intake patterns of institutionalized and free-living older adults with xerostomia. Subjects with xerostomia (more than 75% of the free-living and institutionalized seniors) had significant deficiencies of fiber, potassium, vitamin B-6, iron, calcium, and zinc. Taste and food perception were significantly reduced in the elders with xerostomia. Our study indicates the potential contribution of xerostomia to the high prevalence of geriatric malnutrition in the United States.\r"

Weekly intakes of selected foods were determined using the food frequency questionnaire from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used t-tests to determine significance of difference in frequency of food consumption by ethnicity. The variance in consumption of selected foods was estimated with multiple regression analysis for the independent variables marital status, age, sex, education level, income, birthplace, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was the major variable influencing food intake. There were significant differences (p less than or equal to .05) between ethnic groups: Mexican Americans consumed eggs, poultry, legumes, organ meats, avocados/olives, flour tortillas, and sugar more frequently than non-Hispanic whites; they also used saturated fats in cooking more frequently than non-Hispanic whites; and they consumed skim milk, ice cream/ice milk, beef, all fruits or juices, all vegetables, breads, and oil/margarine less frequently than non-Hispanic whites. These results suggest that ethnicity plays a major role in predicting dietary patterns.\r"

  ".W": "Low body weight and rapid unintentional weight loss are highly predictive of mortality and morbidity in the elderly population. Weight loss is frequently reported in elderly patients. Acute and chronic diseases are leading causes of involuntary weight loss. Whereas physical disease probably accounts for a majority of cases of involuntary weight loss, psychiatric disorders such as dementia and depression also may result in severe nutritional deficiencies. Additional physiological, psychological, and social factors may affect food intake and body weight. Changes in body composition include loss of height and lean body mass and lower basal metabolic rate. Energy requirements decrease because of the lower basal metabolic rate and reduced physical activity. These low energy requirements make it more difficult for the elderly to obtain adequate amounts of required nutrients. Food intake regulation, taste, and olfactory sensitivity may be altered. As 50% of Americans have lost all of their teeth by age 65, chewing problems are often present. Other factors that contribute to poor nutritional status include alterations in the gastrointestinal tract, functional disabilities, lowered socioeconomic status, and social isolation. Finally, because of the increase in both physical and psychiatric disease, the elderly are major users of prescription drugs. Drug/nutrient interactions can result in anorexia and weight loss. The findings indicate that factors causing unintentional weight loss are highly interrelated and difficult to separate. Health care professionals must monitor body weight in elderly persons and carefully evaluate any cases of rapid, unintentional weight loss to prevent further deterioration of health status.\r"

The use of health care services by Hispanic subgroups is dependent upon their residence in a rural or an urban area. This article summarizes national trends in food consumption, health care usage, prevalent health problems, and eating habits of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, the most populous of the Hispanic subgroups. We provide diet modifications for energy-, fat- and sodium-restricted diets, which are part of the treatment for problems prevalent in this ethnic population.

Respondents (greater than 65%) indicated that hospital food was of good quality for characteristics of taste, aroma, appearance, tenderness, cold temperature, freshness, and nutrient value. A substantial majority (greater than 74%) said that foodservice was dependable and accurate and that foodservice employees were helpful, cheerful, and considerate. These food and service characteristics were thought (greater than 71%) to be important to hospital meals, and a very large number (greater than 87%) of respondents considered these characteristics to be important to their hospitalization. About half (50.2%) viewed them as important in selecting a hospital. More than 82% thought registered dietitians were informative, helpful, and available to educate patients. Almost all (greater than 95%) considered nutrition counseling important to health care in the community. Of 17 quality characteristics considered, 14 were positively correlated (p less than .05) with the level of satisfaction with hospitalization. The three characteristics that were not significantly correlated with satisfaction were cold food being at the right temperature, meals looking delicious, and employees being cheerful.\r"

The third edition (1990) reflects new research on diet and health relationships and on the utility of the guidelines to the public. The 1990 guidelines are: Eat a variety of foods; maintain healthy weight; choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; choose a diet with plenty of vegetables, fruits, and grain products; use sugars only in moderation; use salt and sodium only in moderation; and if you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation.\r"

  ".W": "Psychological autopsy methodology has not been applied in studies of elderly suicides, despite the fact that the elderly are associated with a higher rate of suicide than any other age group. One school of thought argues that older adults who die by suicide are socially isolated and/or estranged for a long period of time before death, so that knowledgeable informants are difficult or impossible to obtain. In the present retrospective study we examine the number and availability of knowledgeable informants for 145 older people who committed suicide. We believe that the ability to access several motivated informants per case is essential to any psychological autopsy study by modern standards. The stereotype of the \"average expectable\" elderly suicide victim as socially isolated and living alone or in an institutional setting was not supported by our findings; an unexpectedly high percentage of subjects were married at the time of their death. There was at least one knowledgeable informant in 90% of cases and two or more in almost 50%. In 46%, the subject had expressed despondency over illness. In a prospective study involving interviews with informants for eight subjects, all eight had at least two knowledgeable and willing informants. Two cases of the eight are presented to illustrate the role of delirium and an ominous diagnosis (cancer) as causes of suicide. We conclude that it is feasible to do a psychological autopsy study of elderly suicides.\r"

Medication histories in outpatient records are frequently inaccurate; the accuracy of the histories in hospital records has not previously been studied. We evaluated the accuracy of medication histories recorded in hospital medical records of 122 persons over the age of 65 at three sites, comparing the written record to a structured history obtained from the patient by the research staff. We defined an error as either the failure to record the use of a medication the patient claimed to use or the recording of a medication that the patient denied using. We found that 83% of all patients had at least one such error, and 46% had three or more. We reanalyzed the data excluding over-the-counter, tropical, and cold medications, and found that 60% of all patients still had at least one error, and 18% had three or more. Failure to record use in the record was more common than recording medications the patient denied using. There were no qualitative differences between hospitals or between the histories obtained by interns and attending physicians. This analysis suggests that medication histories in the hospital medical record are not accurate sources of information in elderly persons. Errors in the history may adversely affect clinical care; researchers relying on hospital medical records to determine medication use at the time of admission should first validate their data.\r"

The subjects were 101 healthy community-dwelling cases of zoster and 101 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and race and generated by random digit dialing. The Geriatric Scale of Recent Life Events was administered to case and control subjects, and additional questions were asked regarding the perception of the life event. The results showed that case subjects experienced negative life events significantly more often than subjects in the control groups in the 2 months before zoster onset by analysis of discordant pairs (26 versus 10, odds ratio 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13, 6.27, P = .012), 3 months before (29 versus 11, odds ratio 2.64, 95% CI 1.20, 6.04, P = .007), or 6 months before (35 versus 16, odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 1.04, 3.93, P = .012). The mean number of total life events was significantly higher in cases at 6 months before zoster (case means = 2.64, control means = 1.82, P = .008), but there were no significant differences at 2, 3, or 12 months before. There were no significant differences between case subjects and control subjects for spousal events, or any given single life event. In conclusion, we found that whereas patients with herpes zoster experienced the same kinds of life events in the year preceding the illness as did control subjects, recent events perceived as stressful were significantly more common among patients with zoster.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both univariate and multivariate analyses for the demographics, age, place of residence, and medication use (by drug class) revealed that only place of residence had a significant association with the presence or absence of bacteriuria. In this regard, bacteriuric subjects more commonly resided in the nursing home and less commonly lived in the apartment-house complex compared with nonbacteriuric subjects (P less than .05). Therefore, this study demonstrates that in elderly ambulatory women, medication use does not appear to be associated with the presence or absence of bacteriuria.\r"

This was a prospective study during a 4-month period at a university-affiliated geriatric medical center. Our subjects were 33 patients with chronic indwelling urinary catheters and positive urinary cultures; the urinary catheter was usually changed once a month. A peripheral vein line was used for blood withdrawal and urinary cultures and quantitative blood cultures (Isolator) were performed during and shortly after urinary catheter removal and insertion. All patients had significant bacteriuria (greater than 10(5) cfu/mL) with an average of 2.3 microorganisms. Among the 46 sequential quantitative blood cultures performed, only two patients had bacteremia from the urinary source and at a very low concentration; one patient had 0.13 cfu/mL Str. faecalis in blood 5 minutes after removal of the urinary catheter, and the other 0.1 cfu/mL Proteus mirabilis 5 minutes after reinsertion of a new urinary catheter. None of the patients had any subjective or objective clinical problem during the 36 hours after the urinary manipulation. Clinical symptoms and bacteremia are rare events, and prophylactic antibiotics do not appear necessary during urinary catheter removal and reinsertion in elderly institutionalized patients. Further studies are necessary to identify risk factors in the rare instances of patients with bacteremia.\r"

The prevalence of CIB was 12% (29/238) and increases with age. Unlike the gram-negative organisms that cause overt urinary tract infection in this age group, gram-positive organisms dominated the CIB group. Both the CIB and abacteriuric patients have multiple chronic medical conditions and are indistinguishable on that basis. Twenty-nine elderly men with bacteriuria and 105 abacteriuric subjects were followed with serial urine cultures. During the study period the bacteriuric subjects exhibited spontaneous temporary or permanent resolution (76%, 22/29), intermittency (21%, 6/29), and probable bacterial persistence (38%, 11/29). No consistent pattern of bacteriuria was evident. Therefore, antimicrobial therapy is not warranted in the treatment of asymptomatic or clinically inapparent bacteriuria in ambulatory elderly men.\r"

  ".W": "The Institute of Medicine has placed a priority on determining the special health-care needs of elderly homeless persons. As part of a community-based study of 521 homeless adults in two beach communities of Los Angeles, we compared the demographic characteristics and health of older (age rangek 50-78, n = 61) and younger (age range, 18-49, n = 460) homeless individuals. Compared with younger adults, older adults were more likely to be white (85% versus 61%), veterans (59% versus 27%), retired (36% versus 3%), and living in a vehicle (21% versus 8%). Older adults were more likely to report having a chronic disease (69% versus 49%), functional disabilities, no informal social contacts during the previous month (49% versus 27%), observed high blood pressure (42% versus 22%), elevated creatinine (11% versus 2%), and elevated cholesterol (57% versus 36%). Older adults were less likely to have a toothache (3% versus 30%), report psychotic symptoms (25% versus 42%), and to be illegal drug users (15% versus 55%). Although they are chronologically younger, the constellation of health and functional problems of older homeless adults resemble those of geriatric persons in the general population. We suggest that geriatricians could play a significant role in training other primary-care providers to evaluate and treat socially isolated older homeless adults in a more comprehensive way than is currently standard in practice (e.g., interdisciplinary team care and emphasis on functional status, rehabilitative medicine, and assessment for sensory impairment).\r"

They were then asked to rank 34 topics on which they would like more information. A total of 242 responses were received for a 55% response rate (63 of the 500 were undeliverable). Responses indicated that physicians are more concerned with management than diagnosis and revealed considerable evidence of empathy and concern. The top three topics had to do with the management of dementia, multiple problems, and depression. Approximately 25% of physicians consider problems of financing health care as among the most challenging problems.\r"

Other aggressive medical and surgical interventions should be prospectively considered in addition to resuscitation. The quantity of advance directives will increase when physicians feel motivated to devote time and expertise to thorough discussions of advance directives. Although education and legislation will motivate physicians to some extent, their roles are limited. Fair reimbursement for this primary-care service is the most effective motive. The initial investment by Medicare may save large sums in the long run by reducing expensive, undesired care for older people.\r"

  ".W": "The epithelial cells of the stomach and duodenum are normally protected from the damaging effects of acid and pepsin by a balancing mechanism of mucosal resistance. If an imbalance occurs, peptic ulcer may result. Traditional teaching has emphasized the importance of acid (and pepsin) as the cause of this imbalance; however, it is clear that acid and pepsin are not the only important factors in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer. More recent investigative efforts have been directed at what constitutes mucosal resistance and how it can be disrupted to produce, in the presence of gastric acid, a peptic ulcer. Depletion of endogenous prostaglandins and Helicobacter pylori gastritis have emerged as prominent theories. As evidence exists both to support and refute these theories in humans, any definitive conclusions cannot be made at this time. The acute management of peptic ulcer disease is directed at relieving pain, accelerating ulcer healing, and preventing complications. Peptic ulcers can be healed with antisecretory agents (i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, omeprazole), antacids, prostaglandins, and sucralfate. Because they are effective, safe, and convenient, the H2-receptor antagonists are the most widely used agents for the management of peptic ulcer disease. Because the H2-receptor antagonist agents are equally effective in their indicated uses and are equally safe based on scientifically valid data, selection should be based primarily on cost. Omeprazole is the newest antisecretory agent: a single morning dose of 20 mg suppresses acid secretion for 24 h. The agent offers little advantage over H2-receptor antagonists for the majority of patients with peptic ulcer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute and chronic lesions are distinct, are pathogenetically different, respond differently to drugs, and require different management strategies. The principal rationale for antiulcer therapy in NSAID users is to prevent or reduce potentially fatal outcomes; to date no evaluated drug meets this criterion for efficacy. Antacids and H2-receptor antagonists, based on open uncontrolled studies, appear to heal both gastric and duodenal ulcers, and maintain them healed during continued NSAID use; larger gastric ulcers show delayed healing with conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists during NSAID therapy. No such delay occurs with omeprazole therapy. The suggests that if NSAID-associated gastric ulcers are treated with H2-receptor antagonists, larger doses should be given for longer periods. In patients with no pre-existing ulcer disease, H2-receptor antagonists given prophylactically prevent duodenal but not gastric ulcers; sucralfate does the same. In individuals without peptic ulcer disease taking NSAIDs, misoprostol, given as prophylaxis, reduces the development of gastric ulcers; its beneficial effects on ulcer healing or symptoms during continued NSAID therapy, or its ability to prevent duodenal ulcers or ulcer complications, are not established. Because of diarrhea, the 400 micrograms/day dosage is recommended, especially in the elderly.\r"

  ".W": "Gastroesophageal reflux is commonplace; all humans experience it. For many patients, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a manageable condition. For others, GERD can progress to severe symptoms, inflammation, and disruption of the mucosal lining. Effective therapy calls for a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of GERD. The final common denominator to GERD is a lower esophageal sphincter mechanism that relaxes or is incompetent and allows gastroesophageal reflux to occur. Key factors associated with GERD are (a) gastric content, (b) potency of refluxate, (c) esophageal clearance, (d) tissue resistance, and (e) disruption of the anatomic hiatus. GERD is generally a chronic condition characterized by recurrent symptoms. Treatment goals for the GERD patient need to be defined: is therapy directed toward eliminating the symptoms or is therapy designed to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux? Unfortunately, effective therapy for GERD usually does not affect the mechanism(s) underlying the problem. The broad goals of therapy in GERD are to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and neutralize it, to enhance esophageal clearance, and to protect esophageal mucosa. The therapeutic modalities related to each of these situations are numerous and overlap, but treatment strategies for managing the GERD patient can be used in clinical \"stages\" or as the clinical situation dictates. H2-receptor antagonist therapy has become the \"keystone\" in management of GERD. Unfortunately, not all GERD patients respond to conventional H2-receptor antagonist dosage treatment; high-dose H2-receptor antagonist therapy recently has been demonstrated to be more effective in a greater number of GERD patients with severe esophagitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cimetidine 800 mg b.i.d. in healing lesions and in providing symptomatic relief in patients with ulcerative or erosive esophagitis. Patients with greater than or equal to 8 heartburn episodes during a 1-week screening period, reflux confirmed by esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal ulcers or erosions confirmed by endoscopy were randomized to treatment with placebo or cimetidine for 12 weeks. Cimetidine provided significantly greater (p less than 0.01) improvement (74% vs. 51%) and complete healing (67% vs. 36%) of esophageal lesions than did placebo. In these patients with erosive or ulcerative esophagitis, the median time to achieve 24 h without heartburn was 13 days with cimetidine and 30 days with placebo (p = 0.01). The mean heartburn severity score in the cimetidine group decreased rapidly during the first week and was consistently lower than in the placebo group. Cimetidine, 800 mg twice daily, is effective in promoting healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions and in providing heartburn relief in patients with symptomatic erosive/ulcerative GERD.\r"

Complications of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in these patients may contribute significantly to their morbidity and mortality, and the consequences of this bleeding may be more severe than the underlying predisposing conditions. Because of the importance of gastric acid in the pathogenesis of SRMD, therapy has focused on reduction of the intraluminal acid concentration. Acid neutralization, while effective, is laborious and associated with side effects. H2-receptor antagonists have been used successfully in the prophylaxis and treatment of SRMD and offer the potential for an effective parenteral as well as oral agent. They obviate the need for frequent antacid administration and eliminate some of the troubles and side effects that accompany an intensive antacid regimen. Of the available H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine has been the most thoroughly evaluated. It is equivalent to antacids in the prevention of overt bleeding and offers the advantage of dosing flexibility, ease of administration, and a remarkable safety profile. Cimetidine has also been shown to be effective when administered by intermittent bolus infusions given every 8, 6, or 4 h or by primed continuous infusion, which has proven to be the most successful method of controlling intragastric pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A major predictor of persistent or recurrent bleeding is the magnitude of blood loss before the initial evaluation. Endoscopy has an important role in the evaluation of the patient with suspected or presumed upper GI bleeding. Active bleeding at the time of the endoscopy correlates with the more likely probability of persistent bleeding, which carries a higher morbidity and mortality. In addition, there has been continued interest in the finding of a visible vessel. Although there is some controversy as to what a visible vessel actually is and how closely observations will agree about its recognition, there is general agreement that it is an important endoscopic finding and that it carries a high likelihood of rebleeding. In addition to the finding of a visible vessel, many endoscopists feel that ulcers found in the posterior-inferior wall of the duodenal bulb and high on the lesser curve of the stomach should be considered in a separate category. Owing to their proximity to large vessels, some feel that endoscopic management carries a greater risk because of the possibility of inducing bleeding. A wide variety of endoscopic approaches are available for the therapy of upper GI bleeding. It is convenient to divide these therapies into four categories: (a) topical, (b) injection, (c) mechanical, and (d) thermal. Endoscopic therapy for bleeding ulcers has generally been performed with a high degree of safety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "With the identification of the parietal cell receptors for gastric acid secretion coupled with the introduction of cimetidine in 1977, treatment of acid-peptic diseases was transformed from empiric therapy to an approach based on a clearer understanding of human physiology. Today, physicians are confronted with an array of antiulcer agents that differ within their drug class (e.g., the H2-receptor antagonists) as well as in their mechanisms of action (e.g., neutralize acid, alter mucosal defensive factors, or suppress acid secretion). With minor exceptions, the clinical efficacy of the available antiulcer drugs can be regarded as comparable. Thus, the safety profile becomes the next consideration when choosing among similarly effective drug products. Of the available antiulcer agents, the H2-receptor antagonists as a class have an excellent safety profile, as indicated by more than 25 years of cumulative clinical experience and postmarketing surveillance. Important safety issues with currently available antiulcer drugs, i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, prostaglandin E analogues, and the newest antiulcer agent, omeprazole, are reviewed to place them into perspective for the clinician.\r"

  ".W": "The overall safety of a given drug is determined by its toxicity, side effects, and drug-drug interactions. Thus, a clarification of the mechanisms, importance, and clinical implications of any drug-drug interaction with antiulcer therapy is critical to the use of antiulcer medications. Drug-drug interactions may occur as a result of changes in absorption, metabolism, distribution, or excretion. Fortunately, drug distribution or protein binding is unchanged by antiulcer therapy. Antiulcer drugs may affect absorption by several mechanisms. Ionized medications may bind to the divalent cations of antacids and sucralfate to result in poorly absorbed complexes. Reduced gastric acid may decrease the absorption of medications that are weak bases while enhancing the absorption of weak acids. Drug absorption may be impaired by delayed gastric emptying. Several H2-receptor antagonists, including cimetidine and to a lesser extent ranitidine, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, may reduce the hepatic degradation of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. The degree to which such agents alter drug metabolism is determined by the patient's age, genetics, duration of therapy, degree of cytochrome P450 binding, and the regimen. Because the clinical importance of this interaction cannot always be predicted, caution is recommended whenever drugs metabolized by this system are used concurrently. Development of an understanding of the ways in which drug metabolism interactions occur may lead to more effective and safe use of these medications.\r"

H2-receptor antagonists represent such agents. At UC Davis Medical Center, H2-receptor antagonists were found to be one of the highest-cost drug groups in the hospital. Seventy percent of H2-receptor antagonist use was for intravenous prophylaxis of stress ulcer. After a committee review of available data, H2-receptor antagonists were considered therapeutically equivalent. Cimetidine was chosen as the primary H2-receptor antagonist because of an estimated 36% cost savings. Inpatient H2-receptor antagonist use changed from 90% ranitidine prior to the decision to 90% cimetidine after the decision. A monitoring program revealed that there were similar numbers of elevated drug levels for theophylline, phenytoin, and lidocaine before and after the programmatic change. There was no difference in numbers of patients with theophylline toxicity on cimetidine or ranitidine. The incidence of bleeding from stress ulcer was 1.4% in the year following the change to cimetidine use. With aggressive review and utilization of scientific data, cost-saving H2-receptor antagonist restriction decisions can be made that do not compromise quality care.\r"

These drugs promise to control acid-peptic disease effectively in patients who do not respond adequately to conventional short-acting H2-receptor antagonists. The safety of chronic administration of these drugs has come into question, however. Lifelong profound inhibition of acid secretion in rats induced by superpotent inhibitors of acid secretion or subtotal fundectomy is associated with the development of carcinoid tumors of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric corpus. Available evidence supports a role of gastrin, which becomes chronically elevated in animals subjected to prolonged and profound hypochlorhydria. In humans, hypergastrinemic states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and atrophic gastritis are associated with an increased risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors. Such observations have raised concern that humans may also be susceptible to carcinoid tumor formation in response to potent inhibitors of acid secretion. To date, however, no cases of carcinoid tumor have been attributed to the use of omeprazole in humans. If achlorhydric doses are not used, significant hypergastrinemia can be avoided while effectiveness of treatment is maintained. Such measures should minimize any risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors in humans taking potent long-term antisecretory drugs.\r"

  ".W": "During the proliferative burst after Ag recognition, T cells express cell-surface, high-affinity IL-2R. The importance of IL-2R+ T cells in supporting/mediating tissue injury has been documented by the ability of mAb anti-IL2R therapies to prevent allograft rejection and autoimmunity. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, an experimental model of T-dependent immunity, offers the possibility of studying responses mounted against defined Ag. We previously reported that the chimeric IL-2 toxin (DAB486-IL-2) prevents DTH responses and selectively eliminates activated IL-2R bearing CD4 and CD8 T cells from lymph nodes draining the site of inflammation. We have examined the duration of immunosuppression and relative specificity of action of DAB486-IL-2 and anti-CD3 mAb for Ag-activated clones in a murine model of DTH using two different noncross-reacting haptens. Treatment with DAB486-IL-2 generates a state of selective unresponsiveness to subsequent challenge with the hapten introduced during the therapeutic period. Immediately after cessation of DAB486-IL-2 therapy, immunization with an unrelated hapten induces a normal vigorous immune response. By comparison, anti-CD3 mAb treatment causes a broad immunosuppression because unrelated haptens introduced after anti-CD3 therapy do not evoke a vigorous immune response. After cessation of DAB486-IL-2 toxin treatment response to the hapten is eventually restored probably by cells trafficking from the thymus, because thymectomized hosts remain unresponsive to the hapten. Taken together these data reinforce the role of the IL-2R as an important target for immunosuppression in T cell-mediated immune reactions. DAB-486-IL-2 treatment confers highly selective immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of BALB/c mice with an affinity-purified goat antibody to mouse IgD (GaM delta) stimulates T cell-independent B cell activation as well as later T cell activation. Activated T cells then induce polyclonal differentiation of B cells into IgG1-secreting cells, which results in an approximately 100-fold increase in serum IgG1 level. It is not known whether the same B cells that are initially activated by GaM delta are the progenitors of the IgG1-secreting cells. To investigate this issue a system was developed in which CB20 mice, which are congenic to BALB/c mice but express Ig of the beta allotype rather than the BALB/c alpha allotype, were injected with GaM delta and simultaneously or subsequently also received BALB/c B cells. The IgG1 response generated by the donor BALB/c B cells was quantitated by an assay specific for IgG1 of the alpha allotype. Our experiments with this system indicate that: 1) BALB/c B cells transferred 2 days after CB20 mice were injected with GaM delta generate a much larger IgG1 response than do BALB/c B cells transferred simultaneously with GaM delta antibody; 2) B cells that express membrane IgD generate the great majority of this response; 3) differences in the magnitudes of the responses of BALB/c B cells transferred at different times after CB20 mice were injected with GaM delta antibody cannot be explained by differences in homing of the donor B cells to the host spleen or by short survival of donor BALB/c B cells after their transfer; and 4) the response made by donor BALB/c B cells transferred 2 days after CB20 mice were injected with GaM delta is proportionate to donor cell representation in the host spleen 1 day after their transfer, whereas the response made by donor cells transferred simultaneously with GaM delta is disproportionately small. These observations suggest that most of the IgG1 antibody made by GaM delta-injected mice is generated by newly produced, mIgD+ B cells that appear approximately 2 days after GaM delta injection, rather than by those B cells that are present in the spleen at the time of GaM delta injection, and support the view that signals that induce B cell secretion of Ig require an interaction with at least partially activated Th cells.\r"

  ".U": "91060933\r", 
  ".W": "The CD44 molecule, a molecule which has been previously known as Hermes, Pgp-1, extracellular matrix receptor III, and In(Lu)-related p80, is currently thought to be involved in several steps of normal immune cell function, including lymphocyte adhesion to high endothelial venules and to the extracellular matrix and T cell activation. We now demonstrate that triggering of CD44 on T lymphocytes by anti-CD44 mAb promotes cell adhesion. The induced homotypic adhesion is mediated by lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), because it was inhibited by anti-LFA-1 antibodies and not by anti-LFA-3 antibodies. This notion is supported by the temperature and Mg2+ dependence which is characteristic of LFA-1-mediated adhesion. Moreover, the sensitivity of CD44-induced adhesion to AMG and H7, which both prevent the activation of protein kinase C, and to cytochalasin B, which inhibits microfilament formation, suggests that the activation of the LFA-1 pathway via CD44 involves protein kinase C activation and requires an intact cytoskeleton.\r"

  ".W": "Injection of mice with goat anti-mouse IgD antibody stimulates a large IgG1 anti-goat IgG antibody response, as well as polyclonal IgG1 production. To determine if this phenomenon could be used to induce large antibody responses to other Ag, covalent conjugates were produced between BSA or other Ag and H delta a/1, a mAb specific for IgD of the a allotype, and between BSA and AF3.33, a mAb specific for IgD of the b allotype. Injection of H delta a/1-BSA into BALB/c mice, which express Ig of the a allotype, or into (BALB/c x CB20)F1 mice (a x b allotype heterozygotes) induced IgG1 anti-BSA antibody responses that peaked 8 to 9 days after injection, and were more than 1000 times larger than those induced by injection of BSA alone, and 100 times larger than those induced by injecting unconjugated BSA plus H delta a/1. H delta a/1-BSA was no more immunogenic than unconjugated BSA when injected into CB20 mice, which express Ig of the b allotype, while AF3.33-BSA greatly enhanced anti-BSA antibody production in CB20, but not in BALB/c mice. Mice serially immunized with three different Ag conjugated to H delta a/1 made large antibody responses to all three Ag, provided that the mouse strain used did not recognize allotypic determinants on H delta a/1 as foreign and produce a neutralizing antibody response. Intravenous and s.c. routes of inoculation produced responses of similar magnitude and relatively low variability; responses to footpad or intramuscular inoculation were more variable, and i.p. inoculation induced smaller responses. Injection of BALB/c mice i.v. with 100 micrograms of H delta a/1-BSA induced an IgG1 anti-BSA response of 5.6 mg/ml, which was approximately 70% of the total IgG1 response. Anti-BSA responses to 30 micrograms of conjugate or less were much smaller, but could be considerably enhanced by adding unconjugated H delta a/1 to the inoculum. This system will be useful for the rapid stimulation of large antibody responses to biologically important Ag, and for investigating mechanisms of Ag processing and B and T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Chickens that have been surgically bursectomized at 60 h of embryonic development usually generate Ig producing B cells; however, the bursectomized chickens are incapable of specific antibody responses, even after repeated immunization. In the present work, we analyzed the molecular basis of this immunodeficiency. In the bursectomized chickens, DNA sequencing revealed a repertoire of Ig L and H chains with a low number of different V-J and V-D-J joints, indicating an oligoclonal B cell compartment. In addition, the L and H chains belonging to each B cell clone had similar gene conversion events in the V region. In situ hybridization to Harderian gland tissue sections showed, that B cells of the bursectomized chickens were, however, capable of terminal plasma cell maturation. Thus, in chickens that were lacking the bursal microenvironment, 1) only a few B cell precursors differentiated into mature Ig-producing B cells, 2) low rate of gene conversion resulted in restricted Ig diversity. Regarding the chicken B cell differentiation, the present data support a model that the induction of B cell differentiation is a bursa-independent event, whereas the bursa of Fabricius has a crucial role in the amplification and diversification of the embryonic B cell repertoire.\r"

Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Pgp-1 expression increased when B cells were activated with supernatant of cloned Th2 cells, with LPS, or with IL-5, stimuli that induced polyclonal proliferation and differentiation. IL-5-primed B cells were phenotypically unique and could be divided into two distinct subpopulations based on the brightness of Pgp-1 expression. Furthermore, sterile sorting experiments showed that proliferating and differentiating B cells were highly enriched in a Pgp-1-bright, Ia-dull, B220-dull subpopulation. The possibility that Pgp-1 expressed on activated B cells functions as an adhesion molecule was evaluated by assessing adhesion of activated B cells to defined substrates. It was found that IL-5-activated B cells bound strongly to hyaluronate-coated surface, and this binding was specifically inhibited by anti-Pgp-1 Ab. These findings suggest that Pgp-1 expression is a useful marker which, under defined conditions, identifies the proliferating and differentiating subset of activated B cells. Moreover, the Pgp-1 bright subset of IL-5-primed B cells binds to hyaluronate in a Pgp-1-dependent manner that suggests a potential role of Pgp-1 in the in vivo adherence and trafficking of activated B cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the functional property of murine CD2 as an intercellular adhesion molecule by using five anti-murine CD2 mAb which were classified into two groups according to their mutual competition in binding to cell surface CD2. Hamster fibroblasts transfected with murine CD2 cDNA exhibited increased conjugate formation with a murine mastocytoma P815 which expresses the putative murine LFA-3 mRNA detected by cross-hybridization with human LFA-3 cDNA under conditions of low stringency. This increase in conjugate formation was abrogated by both groups of anti-CD2 mAb, although some differences in the extent of inhibition were observed at lower concentrations of the mAb. We then examined the involvement of CD2 in several murine T cell responses by using these mAb to abrogate CD2-mediated cellular interactions. Anti-CD2 mAb significantly inhibited mitogenic T cell responses induced by suboptimal doses of Con A and PHA. In the allogenic MLR response and in the Ag response of two KLH/I-Ak-specific Th cell clones, the inhibitory effect of anti-CD2 mAb was also greatest under suboptimal conditions, i.e., with lesser doses of the Ag. These results indicate that the contribution of CD2 as an accessory molecule is variable, depending on the Ag dose used for stimulation, and they suggest that CD2 is involved in the Ag response of murine T cells under the physiologic conditions where only a limited amount of Ag is available. We next examined the contribution of CD2 to MHC-restricted cytotoxicity by CTL and to MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity by NK and lymphokine-activated killer cells. Only a marginal inhibition by anti-CD2 mAb alone was observed. Anti-lymphocyte function-associated Ag (LFA)-1 mAb alone exhibited greater inhibitory effects than anti-CD2 mAb in all of the cases tested. In most cases, however, substantial levels of cytotoxicity remained, even in the presence of both anti-CD2 and anti-LFA-1 mAb. These results indicate a minor contribution of CD2, as compared with LFA-1, to cytotoxicity by murine CTL, NK cells, and lymphokine-activated killer cells, and they reveal the presence of undefined cellular interaction pathways other than those mediated by CD2 and LFA-1.\r"

Addition of optimal amounts of IL-4 (100 U/ml) to cultures of tonsil mononuclear cells resulted in a mean increase in IgG production of 175% and in IgE production of 2460%. Frequency analysis of IgE- and IgG-producing B cells, using an ELISA spot assay, showed parallel increases in both Ig production and numbers of Ig-secreting B cells. IgE production was also enhanced by addition of IL-2 (10 U/ml) and maximal IgE production was obtained with a combination of IL-4 and IL-2. MPN (10(-7) M) and CsA (1 microgram/ml) markedly reduced IL4-induced IgE and IgG production as well as numbers of Ig-secreting cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The suppression of Ig production by the cyclosporins was restricted to the immunosuppressive compounds CsA, CsG, and dihydro-CsD, but not the nonimmunosuppressive drug CsH. Delayed addition of CsA revealed that inhibition was maximal when the drug was added during the first 48 h after addition of IL-4 to the culture. Addition of IL-2 (10 U/ml) partially overcame the inhibition induced by CsA. In coculture experiments, in which separated T or B cells were precultured with the drugs and the cells were then combined and further incubated in the presence of IL-4, the suppressive effects of CsA on IgE production were related to pretreatment of the T but not B cells. The maximum inhibiting effects of MPN were similarly observed when the drug was present in the cultures from the beginning, and addition of IL-2 also partially reversed this inhibition. In contrast to the results with CsA, pretreatment of the B but not T cells with MPN-reduced IgE production. These studies demonstrate that IL-4 increases both numbers of IgE-secreting cells as well as IgE production and CsA and MPN differentially affect the responding T and B cells, resulting in inhibition of Ig production.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the expression of an immediate/early type gene, Egr-1, in murine B lymphocyte responses to Ag receptor-generated signals. The Egr-1 gene encodes a zinc finger protein with sequence-specific DNA binding activity and is believed to act as an intracellular \"third messenger,\" to couple receptor-generated signals to activation-associated changes in gene expression. We show here that Egr-1 mRNA expression is rapidly and transiently (returning to basal levels by 6 h) induced after receptor crosslinking with anti-receptor antibodies. Egr-1 protein expression is more prolonged, maintaining detectable levels through 12 h. The induction of Egr-1 is a primary response to Ag receptor signaling, as it is independent of new protein synthesis and is inhibited by actinomycin D. We have also examined the linkage of Egr-1 to known signaling pathways associated with G0 to G1 transition by these cells in response to signals generated through the B cell Ag receptor. Egr-1 mRNA was not induced after elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. In contrast, the pharmacologic agents PMA and SC-9, which directly activate protein kinase C, both cause marked increases in Egr-1 mRNA levels with the same kinetics as observed after anti-receptor antibody stimulation. Further, the protein kinase C inhibitors H7, sangivamycin, and staurosporin block anti-receptor antibody-induced expression of Egr-1, thus, B cell Ag receptor-linked Egr-1 expression is likely coupled to the protein kinase C component of transmembrane signaling. Preliminary promoter mapping studies are consistent with this conclusion, because both PMA and anti-receptor antibody act through the same or overlapping cis-regulatory elements.\r"

The onset of this response occurs 6 days after G alpha M delta injection and peaks by day 7 to 8. Utilizing two color fluorescence analysis and cell sorting we demonstrate that most mIgG1-expressing B cells lack mIgM during the period of onset of Ig isotype switching (day 6). Both IgG1 and IgE are produced predominantly by mIgM- cells. On day 6, IgG1 and IgE are secreted predominantly by cells expressing mIgG1 and mIgE, respectively. By day 8, a majority of the IgG1 secretion occurs among the mIgG1- cells but virtually all IgE secretion continues to come from the mIgE+ population. B cells that strongly express mIgG1 secrete little IgM or IgE. Freshly harvested B cells expressing mIgG1, 6 days after G alpha M delta injection, have undergone substantial deletion of CH mu-specific DNA in contrast to their mIgG1- counterparts. Hence, the great majority of B cells that switch to the IgG1 or IgE isotypes in vivo rapidly lose their expression of IgM.\r"

  ".W": "When bone marrow (BM) lymphoid cells from 12 adult healthy donors were labeled by CD24 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry, two positive populations of cells were demonstrated in each sample (by a separated bimodal specific immunofluorescence). One population had intermediate CD24-Ag density (termed CD24+ cells) whereas the other had high CD24-Ag density (termed CD24(2+) cells). CD24+ cells represented 5.8 +/- 2.7% of the total lymphoid BM cells and CD24(2+) cells 5.6 +/- 2.5%. Using dual fluorescence analysis on eight samples, all CD24+ cells expressed the CD21 and CD37 mature B cell Ag and also surface IgM (sIgM), but this population lacked CD10 Ag. These cells also expressed CD19 Ag, and at a higher density than CD24(2+) cells. They were also positive for HLA-DR Ag. Conversely, CD24(2+) cells were shown to be early cells of the B cell lineage. While all the CD24(2+) cells were HLA-DR+ and CD19+, 64 +/- 16% of them expressed CD20 Ag (at a lower density than CD24+ cells), 65 +/- 21% CD10 Ag, and 22 +/- 8% were positive for cytoplasmic mu-chains (c mu). None of these cells expressed the CD21 and CD37 mature B cell Ag or sIgM. Additional experiments on four different healthy donors demonstrated that 30 +/- 9% of the CD24(2+) cells expressed the CD34 Ag and that the CD24+ cells did not express it. Thus, the CD24 Ag permits discrimination between two populations of the B cell lineage present in adult BM: 1) A CD24(2+) cell population including \"pre\" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+/-, CD20-, CD21-, CD34+, CD37-, c mu-), \"intermediate\" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, c mu-), and \"true\" pre-B cells (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10+, CD20+, CD21-, CD34-, CD37-, c mu+). 2) A CD24+ cell population including B cells of the standard phenotype (HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD10-, CD20+, CD21+, CD34-, CD37+, c mu-, sIgM+).\r"

  ".W": "Oral tolerance, an important feature of the mucosal immune system, appears to protect against immune-mediated disease by blunting production of systemic IgG and IgM antibody directed toward immunogens chronically present at mucosal surfaces. In this study, we explored the role of oral tolerance and mucosal immunoregulation in an experimental model of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), an important form of nephritis in humans. Cyclophosphamide and estradiol were used to inhibit the expression of oral tolerance, which otherwise develops after chronic oral presentation of Ag. BALB/c mice given drinking water containing 0.1% bovine gamma globulin (BGG) continuously for 14 wk were randomly assigned to groups given either 2 mg of cyclophosphamide i.p., 2 mg of estradiol s.c. or both drugs. Groups of control mice received neither BGG nor drugs. In three separate experiments, a low percentage of saline-treated orally immunized mice had microscopic hematuria (0 to 20%), as did nonimmunized controls (0 to 20%). However, 58 to 83% of mice given estradiol and/or cyclophosphamide at appropriate times developed significant hematuria. If drugs were given at suboptimal times, only 25 to 56% of mice developed hematuria. Drug-treated immunized mice also had more serum IgG and IgM anti-BGG antibodies than control and saline groups. Immunofluorescence showed significantly more glomerular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 in drug-treated immunized mice compared to saline-treated immunized and normal untreated control mice. Hematuria and glomerular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 paralleled serum IgG and IgM antibody. All immunized mice showed significant mesangial IgA and BGG deposits and there were no differences in such deposits between saline- and drug-treated immunized mice. We suggest that blunting of oral tolerance with promotion of systemic IgG and IgM antibody production leads to nephritis in chronically orally immunized mice and that glomerular immune complexes containing IgG and/or IgM promote complement deposition and hematuria in IgAN. Analogous defects in oral (or more generally mucosal) tolerance could play a role in the genesis of symptomatic human IgAN.\r"

Epitope mapping was carried out with a rabbit polyclonal immune serum against fusion proteins expressed in prokaryotic cells. After screening of an initial human thyroglobulin cDNA library and subcloning of immunoreactive clones, seven epitopes were characterized and localized on the human thyroglobulin monomeric molecule. One was close to each extremity of the molecule, and five others were concentrated in the middle, covering a sixth of this 2748-amino-acid chain. The immunoreactivities of 18 autoimmune sera from different thyroid pathologies were tested against the seven previously characterized epitopes. Those from Hashimoto's thyroiditis were the most immunoreactive. Immune responses were heterogeneous for sera from different pathologies as well as for those from the same pathology. The central epitopes and the near-C-terminal epitope, however, were the epitopes most often recognized by the immune sera. These findings show that some autoepitopes overlap accurately with some heteroepitopes characterized by a polyclonal immune serum directed against the mature protein.\r"

  ".U": "91060948\r", 
  ".W": "Mechanisms accounting for HIV-associated suppression of lymphocyte proliferation were investigated. In previous work we demonstrated that purified and inactivated HIV-suppressed lymphoid cell proliferation. In this report we used an inactivated preparation of HIV obtained from infected CEM cells grown in serum free media and demonstrated that this HIV-associated suppression acted in the early steps of activation to inhibit the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphorus into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. Initially we showed that both purified CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets were affected and HIV-associated inhibition did not require the CD4 molecule. Impaired lymphocyte blastogenesis (decreased size and granularity and decreased expression of receptors to IL-2 and transferrin) in response to PHA indicated an effect of inactivated HIV on the early steps of activation. This was confirmed by time studies where 1) a 2 min HIV-pretreatment followed by washing before stimulation was sufficient to inhibit PHA induced proliferation of normal lymphocytes, and 2) addition of HIV to PHA prestimulated lymphocytes failed to inhibit proliferation, e.g., there was no effect on preactivated lymphocytes. HIV was mainly inhibitory of lymphocyte proliferation induced by PHA or mAb to the CD3 receptor. In contrast to the effect on the CD3/TiR, responses via the CD2 receptor were not suppressed, e.g., stimulation with the monoclonal antibodies T11(2) + T11(3). Inasmuch as responses by direct A23187 + PMA stimulation of intracellular pathways were also inhibited, it appears that the HIV-induced defect was not (or not only) membrane receptor mediated. The earliest (min) measurable event after stimulation was the initial increase in intracellular Ca2+ which was unaffected by HIV pretreatment. The next measurable event (min to h) of stimulation is a sustained increase in inositol phospholipid turnover. Pretreatment of mononuclear cells with inactivated HIV resulted in a decreased inositol phospholipid turnover as judged from decreased 32P incorporation into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This led to decreased generation of DAG as reflected in the reduced radiolabeling of its metabolite PA. Reduced availability of DAG presumably interferes with pkC activation and leads to decreased expression of receptors for IL-2 and transferrin and impaired proliferation.\r"

Furthermore, the reactivity of these CTL clones with PHA-induced T cells was blocked by HLA class I monomorphic mAb. These results demonstrated that the HLA-C blank Ag are expressed on the surfaces of PBL. Thus, despite the fact that the HLA-C blank Ag are expressed on normal PBL, they are incapable of generating corresponding alloantibodies. On the other hand, the present study demonstrated that these Ag on normal PBL are able to induce specific CTL and that the capacity of these Ag to induce allogeneic CTL is almost identical to that of HLA-B Ag, indicating that they may function as alloantigens in vivo and play a significant role in the rejection of organ grafts and in the graft-versus-host reaction in bone marrow transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "When elicited in the skin of mice, either IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity reactions or T cell-dependent contact sensitivity (CS) reactions result in local extravasation of [125I]fibrinogen and deposition of [125I]fibrin. However, these two types of reaction differ in kinetics and in requirement for IgE, mast cells, or T cells. In the present study, we investigated the kinetics and magnitude of [125I]fibrin deposition in combined IgE-dependent and CS reactions elicited simultaneously at the same site and compared the results with those obtained when the two reactions were elicited at separate sites. We found that [125I]fibrin deposition in pure IgE-dependent reactions was greater at 2 or 6 h after challenge than at 24 h, but that significant fibrin deposition persisted at those sites 24 h after challenge. In CS reactions, [125I]fibrin deposition was detected as early as 2 h after challenge, indicating that fibrin deposition accompanies the \"early component\" of CS detected by Van Loveren et al. with the use of measurements of tissue swelling. But much more [125I]fibrin deposition was present in CS reactions at 24 h than at 2 or 6 h after Ag challenge. When IgE-dependent and CS reactions were elicited at the same site, [125I]fibrin deposition at early intervals (2 to 6 h) after challenge was increased three- to 25-fold compared with that seen in isolated CS reactions, but at 24 h the results in the combined reactions were virtually identical to those in CS responses. Studies in genetically mast cell-deficient and congenic normal mice indicated that mast cells were required for expression of the IgE-dependent augmentation of [125I]fibrin deposition observed at early intervals in combined IgE-dependent and CS reactions, but not for the [125I]fibrin deposition associated with \"pure\" CS reactions. These findings indicate that the net effect of IgE-dependent mast cell activation on CS responses is to increase the fibrin deposition associated with these responses, but this effect is appreciated only at early intervals after elicitation of the reaction.\r"

The purpose of the present study was to determine seroreactivity of patients with BP to six nonoverlapping synthetic peptides representing sequences in the carboxyl domain of the recently cloned 230-kDa BP Ag. Sera from 40 patients with BP, 57 normal subjects, and 18 patients with other autoimmune blistering skin diseases were examined in an ELISA for binding to six synthetic peptides varying between 17 and 19 amino acids in length. The binding of IgG from patients with BP to three synthetic peptides, P1-2, P1-1, and P3-1, was significantly different from that seen in the normal controls (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Affinity-purified anti-P1-2 antibody from a patient with BP bound in a characteristic linear band to the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin and immunoprecipitated the native 230-kDa BP Ag. Serum IgG antibodies from a rabbit immunized with a BP fusion protein that contains the sequences for P1-1 and P1-2, bound on ELISA to P1-2 but not to P1-1. These data suggest that multiple epitopes on the 230-kDa BP Ag are recognized by circulating autoantibodies in patients with this disease, and that an epitope encoded within the synthetic peptide P1-2 is expressed on the native molecule and may be relevant in the generation of an immune response both in man and in an animal model.\r"

The production of secretory antibodies by mucosally associated B cells is an important component of pulmonary host defense mechanisms.

There were no changes in the relative distribution of T or B cells among intraparenchymal pulmonary lymphocytes after blood loss. Hemorrhage induced decreases of between 5- and 10-fold in the frequencies and numbers of pulmonary B cell clonal precursors specific for the bacterial Ag levan and Pseudomonas aeruginosa polysaccharide. These decreases in numbers and frequencies of bacterial Ag-specific pulmonary B cell clonal precursors were present between 3 and 10 days after blood loss. Similar decreases in numbers and frequencies were found among pulmonary clonal precursors specific for the autoantigen mouse transferrin, but not for the autoantigen dsDNA or the external antigens OVA and keyhole limpet hemocyanin. These results demonstrate that hemorrhage produces marked alterations in pulmonary B cell repertoires, which may contribute to postinjury abnormalities in host defenses.\r"

  ".W": "Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (H alpha 2M) is a major IL-1 beta binding plasma protein. The characteristics of the H alpha 2M IL-1 beta complex formation suggested, that cleavage of the internal thiol ester in other members of the alpha-macroglobulin family (alpha M) could enable these proteins to bind IL-1 beta. Characterization of optimal conditions for binding 125I IL-1 beta to H alpha 2M showed that H alpha 2M-IL-1 beta complex formation could be obtained over a pH range of 6.3 to 9 in the presence of some metal cations (i.e., Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+). Other divalent metal cations (i.e., Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+) were without effect. Time kinetic studies showed that binding of IL-1 beta to H alpha 2M was complete within 200 min and that H alpha 2M-IL-1 beta complexes became increasingly resistant to dissociation by boiling in SDS as a function of incubation time. Human pregnancy zone protein, rat alpha 1-, alpha 2-macroglobulin (R alpha 1M, R alpha 2M), all homologous with H alpha 2M, were tested for their ability to bind IL-1 beta. In each instance, alpha M-IL-1 beta complex formation was observed only after treatment of alpha M with methylamine, a primary amine that causes cleavage of the internal thiol ester in alpha M and the appearance of free thiol groups. Similarly, for each of these proteins, complex formation was increased several fold in the presence of Zn2+. Competition experiments using cytokines or proteins of similar molecular mass as IL-1 beta established that only unlabeled IL-1 beta was effective in inhibiting binding of 125I IL-1 beta to H\"F\" alpha 2M. Acylation of H\"F\" alpha 2M by diethylpyrocarbonate blocked the binding of IL-1 beta when analyzed by native PAGE. Deacylation of H\"F\" alpha 2M with hydroxylamine partially restored the binding capacity of H\"F\" alpha 2M further supporting the involvement of histidyl residues in the Zn2(+)-dependent binding of IL-1 beta. Reduced thioredoxin, but not its alkylated form, from Escherichia coli readily releases H\"F\" alpha 2M bound IL-1 beta under conditions that did not lead to reduction of disulfide bonds in H\"F\" alpha 2M. The action of thioredoxin also augmented IL-1-like activity in two independent bioassays suggesting that H\"F\" alpha 2M bound IL-1 beta is partially biologically inactive or latent. These results suggest that \"activated\" alpha M exert a modulating role for IL-1 beta by exposing specific binding sites, which are inaccessible in the native proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "IL-1, like other agents that have been shown a capacity to induce protein kinase C, is a potent transcriptional activator of the metalloproteinase, stromelysin, in synovial and other fibroblasts. cAMP has been shown to inhibit stromelysin transcription in fibroblasts of nonsynovial origin, and is regarded as an important second messenger for IL-1. In addition to stimulating metalloproteinase transcription, IL-1 also induces PGE2 production in synoviocytes. We determined that rIL-1 alpha led to the time-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP in serum-starved rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, and that the effect was blocked by indomethacin. The cAMP agonists forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and PGE2 suppressed the IL-1 induction of stromelysin; conversely, indomethacin superinduced IL-1-elicited stromelysin mRNA. These results were recapitulated on the transcriptional level in cells transfected with the rat transin/stromelysin promoter in a reporter (CAT) construct. 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, also augmented the IL-1 induction of stromeylsin mRNA, as did H-8, a specific inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Staurosporine and H-7, inhibitors of protein kinase C, blocked the IL-1 induction of stromelysin mRNA. We conclude that IL-1 appears to stimulate at least two transduction pathways in synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and that these have antagonistic effects on the regulation of stromelysin transcription.\r"

  ".W": "By intrasplenic immunization we raised a rat mAb (mAb V1q; IgG2a, kappa) with a potent neutralizing activity against natural mouse TNF (1 microgram/ml mAb V1q/100 U/ml TNF). mAb V1q was used to study the role of endogenous TNF in experimental peritonitis induced by sublethal cecal ligation and puncture. mAb V1q persisted for over 5 days in the serum of mice injected with 100 micrograms of the antibody and, therefore, proved useful for in vivo experiments. As little as 20 micrograms mAb V1q/mouse prevented lethal shock of the animals by 400 micrograms LPS/mouse. In sublethal cecal ligation and puncture i.p. injection of mAb V1q directly and up to 8 h after induction of experimental peritonitis lead to death of the animals within 1 to 3 days. The lethal effect of mAb V1q was compensated by injection of recombinant mouse TNF. Similar mAb V1q effects as in immunocompetent mice were shown in severe combined immune deficiency mice deficient of mature functional B and T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that during the early phase of peritonitis endogenous TNF may stimulate nonlymphoid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, platelets, and fibroblasts to ingest bacteria and to localize inflammation, respectively. These beneficial effects of TNF may determine survival. Thus, our data may have implications for the therapeutic management of a beginning peritonitis.\r"

TGF beta 1 alone, or in combination with IL-5 or IL-2 increases IgA secretion by populations of LPS-activated surface IgA negative (sIgA-) spleen B cells, while concurrently decreasing IgM and IgG secretion. The present study demonstrates the activity of TGF beta 1 as an IgA isotype switch factor at the clonal level. Stimulation of LPS-activated sIgA- spleen B cell populations with TGF beta 1, or a combination of TGF beta 1 and IL-2, resulted in a significant increase in total numbers of IgA secreting cells, and this increase ultimately was paralleled by an increase in total IgA secretion. Using limiting dilution analysis, TGF beta 1 was shown to increase the frequency of IgA secreting B cell clones, by approximately 20-fold. This was not accompanied by increased numbers of IgA secreting cells/clone. In contrast, IL-2 does not have activity as an IgA switch factor, but does increase IgA production by B cells already committed to secrete that isotype. Cell cycle inhibitors such as thymidine and hydroxyurea also selectively increased numbers of IgA secreting cells and total IgA secretion among populations of LPS-activated sIgA- spleen B cells. This suggests the IgA enhancing activity of TGF beta 1 may, in part, be related to its ability to inhibit cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "Bone marrow cells from a child with an immature (CD2+, CD5+, CD7+) acute T lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) were cultured in the presence and absence of human rIL-2, IL-3, or granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF. Cells cultured without growth factors failed to divide and those initiated in the presence of IL-2 or GM-CSF underwent maturation and terminal T lymphoid or myelomonocytic differentiation, respectively. In contrast, a permanent growth factor-dependent cell line, designated TALL-103/3, was established upon culture in IL-3. The TALL-103/3 cells gradually lost the T cell-specific markers and acquired a myeloid phenotype (CD15+, CD33+). Switching of the IL-3-dependent cells at an early passage to medium containing only human rIL-2 resulted in the establishment of a subline, named TALL-103/2, with a T lymphoid phenotype (CD3+, CD8+, TCR-gamma delta +, CD7+). The TALL-103/2 cells strictly require IL-2 for growth, are irreversibly committed to the lymphoid lineage, and cannot survive in the presence of any other hemopoietic growth factor tested so far. In contrast, the IL-3-dependent TALL-103/3 cells could be adapted to grow in synthetic (serum-free) medium also in the presence of either GM-CSF or IL-5, in which they retain a myeloid phenotype. Interestingly, after 18 mo in culture in IL-3, the TALL-103/3 cells can still be phenotypically converted to the lymphoid lineage upon addition of IL-2, thus maintaining its bipotentiality. Despite the marked phenotypic differences, the TALL-103/2 and TALL-103/3 cell lines show the same karyotypes with multiple abnormalities present in the primary malignant clone and have identical rearrangements of the TCR-gamma and -delta loci, thus confirming their derivation from a common precursor cell. Together, these findings indicate that the phenotype of immature T-ALL cells can be drastically modified by the presence of specific hemopoietic growth factors in the environment, leading to either lymphoid or myeloid lineage commitment while leaving their karyotype and genotype intact.\r"

In order to probe further into the suspected role of protein kinase C in mouse peritoneal macrophage activation, the effects of protein kinase inhibitors in macrophage Fc gamma R and Ia Ag expression were studied. The protein kinase inhibitor, H7, reduced basal levels, and inhibited IFN-alpha-induced expression of Fc gamma R significantly. The concentration of H7 required to inhibit 50% of the Fc gamma R induction was approximately 12 microM, which reflects the previously reported affinity of this compound for PKC in vitro. H7 had only a minimal effect on IFN-gamma-induced Fc gamma R, suggesting different pathways of Fc gamma R induction by the two types of IFN. Ia induction by IFN-gamma was also inhibited by H7, indicating that both types of IFN can utilize PKC to mediate at least part of the signal required for Fc gamma R or Ia expression. HA-1004, a derivative of H7 which possesses high affinity for cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, but low affinity for PKC, did not alter induction, while H8, a slightly less effective PKC inhibitor than H7, was effective at higher concentrations. Another structurally distinct PKC antagonist, staurosporine, was also effective inhibiting IFN-alpha-induced Fc gamma R and IFN-gamma-induced Ia Ag expression, providing additional evidence that PKC is important. H7 was found to be effective when added as late as several hours after IFN treatment, indicating a prolonged or delayed requirement of PKC for optimal induction of Ia and Fc gamma R by IFN.\r"

  ".W": "In the serum of normal BALB/c mice, IgG antibody reactivity to mouse actin and tubulin, DNA, and TNP groups was very low compared to that of the IgM. This activity was considerably increased when IgG was separated, by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose, whereas no difference in the IgM activity was observed. Addition of IgM to IgG isolated from the same serum resulted in the inhibition of IgG binding to these Ag. Isolation of IgG antibodies on actin, TNP, and tubulin immunoadsorbents has indicated that at least part of the IgG antibodies is polyreactive. In order to understand this inhibition better, experiments with F(ab')2 fragments of IgG were performed. IgM inhibited the binding of F(ab')2 to the antigens in a dose-dependent manner and reacted with immobilized F(ab')2. IgM isolated on F(ab')2 immunoadsorbent, as compared to the initial IgM preparation, were less active toward the Ag but more inhibitory for IgG binding to the Ag. In some pathologic situations, IgM failed to inhibit some IgG antibody activities. The anti-DNA IgG activity from (NZB x NZW)F1 mice was not affected by autologous IgM. Similarly the anti-tubulin IgG from mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were less inhibited by IgM from autologous serum than antitubulin IgG from normal mice. These results are compatible with the existence in normal mice of an idiotypic-like network, regulating via an IgM population in the serum, the binding of IgG autoantibodies to self Ag. Modifications of this idiotype-anti-idiotype system might lead to the expression and/or expansion of autoreactive IgG-producing clones.\r"

  ".W": "Cross-linking of the IgE receptor on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells by multivalent Ag (DNP-BSA) causes a rapid conversion to a detergent-insoluble form. There is a concurrent increase in the amount of filamentous actin associated with the plasma membrane. Both the degree of receptor detergent insolubility and the rise in F-actin content are rapid with a half-maximal response of less than 1 min and can be rapidly reversed by the addition of monovalent Ag (DNP-lysine). These two early steps in the triggering of rat basophilic leukemia cells can be dissociated from each other by pretreatment of the cells with either cytochalasin or sodium azide. These reagents block the increase in F-actin but have no effect on receptor detergent insolubility. This indicates that microfilaments are not responsible for detergent insolubility of the receptor and that it may be the membrane skeleton that is interacting with the complex. This was further confirmed by the finding that cross-linking of the IgE receptors on the surface of purified plasma membranes also leads to detergent insolubility of the receptor. Therefore, all of the components necessary for detergent insolubility of the receptor are present in the plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic components are not needed. These results suggest that detergent insolubility and immobility of the cross-linked receptors are caused by multivalent interaction with the membrane skeleton. Actin filaments may then interact with these receptor-membrane skeletal complexes in order to produce large scale clustering and capping. The membrane skeleton may therefore be acting as an intermediate structure between the cell-surface receptors and microfilaments.\r"

The La(SS-B) polypeptides were encoded by polymerase chain reaction-derived overlapping or nonoverlapping fragments of the La(SS-B) gene, which encodes a protein of 408 amino acids (aa). Of the 166 sera tested, 99% reacted with a fusion protein comprising the first 107 N-terminal aa (LaA); 91% reacted with a fusion protein comprising aa 111 to 242 (LaC), and 91% reacted with a fusion protein comprising aa 346 to 408 (LaL2/3) at the C terminus of La(SS-B). The order of immunodominance as assessed by the number of sera reacting with each epitope and the strength of the reactivity was LaA (aa 1 to 107) greater than LaC (aa) 111 to 242) much greater than LaL2/3 (aa 346 to 408). Cross-reactivity was observed between antibodies eluted from LaC (aa 111 to 242) and LaL2/3 (aa 346 to 408), but there was no significant primary sequence homology between the two regions. The LaC region contained at least two epitopes, one encompassing a putative RNA-binding motif (aa 112 to 187) which was recognized by 83% of patient sera. Serial serum samples from three patients showed that the antibody response to La(SS-B) was initially directed to the N terminus (LaA, aa 1 to 107), but over a period of time all three major epitopes, including that encompassing the putative RNA-binding motif, were recognized. This result suggests that the primary immune response to La(SS-B) is restricted to an immunodominant epitope. As the specificity of the autoantibody response broadens, it includes the RNA-binding motif, which may have important implications for the expression of disease.\r"

A liposome model was used to study the mechanism of DAF action and examine the effects of membrane-bound glycophorin and LPS on the regulatory activity of DAF. Liposomes were incubated in MgEGTA-treated human serum and activation of the alternative pathway measured by C3b binding. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol activated the alternative pathway in proportion to their content of PE. Incorporation of 10(-7) mol/mol phospholipid of either human E or HeLa cell-derived DAF inhibited C activation by liposomes containing 40% phosphatidylethanolamine by 50%, an efficiency comparable to that observed in intact E. HeLa DAF that had been treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to remove its glycolipid anchor had no effect on C activation by liposomes at concentrations as high as 10(-5) mol/mol phospholipid. Incorporation of DAF into liposomes prepared with bound C3b inhibited the deposition of additional C3b by C3bBbP. However, the incorporated DAF increased the amount of Bb generated from B in the presence of D indicating that accelerated decay of the convertase was the primary effect of DAF. Similarly, treatment of intact human E with anti-DAF decreased the amount of Bb generated by the alternative pathway convertase. To study the effects of other membrane components on DAF activity, liposomes were prepared with purified human glycophorin A or LPS. In glycophorin liposomes the presence of PE was required to activate the alternative pathway and DAF inhibited this activation. In contrast, LPS liposomes bound C3b independently of PE and the incorporation of DAF had no effect. These results demonstrate that within a membrane, DAF's inhibitory activity on the alternative pathway C3 convertase is mediated independently of other membrane proteins, that in this model the major activity of DAF is to accelerate convertase decay, and that the presence of other membrane molecules that may serve as C3 acceptors can circumvent DAF function.\r"

We used this set of Ig to dissect the interaction of individual Ig domains with human Fc gamma receptors. Only one of the chimeras, epsilon/C gamma 2,3 (an mIgE with C epsilon 3 and C epsilon 4 replaced by C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 from huIgG1), binds tightly to the human Fc gamma RI on U937 cells. We found that epsilon/C gamma 2,3 has only twofold lower affinity for Fc gamma RI as compared to huIgG1. The gamma/C epsilon 4 (huIgG1 with C epsilon 4 replacing C gamma 3) binds weakly to Fc gamma RI. The other chimeric Ig, epsilon/C gamma 3, epsilon/C gamma 2, and gamma/C epsilon 3, as well as mIgE do not bind detectably to Fc gamma RI. From these data we conclude that the C gamma 2 domain is crucial for binding and contains the majority of the binding site for Fc gamma RI on IgG1. The C gamma 3 domain makes a smaller contribution to the binding, and the C gamma 1 domain and the hinge region have very little effect on the Fc gamma RI-IgG1 interaction. The chimeric epsilon/C gamma 2,3 and huIgG1 both mediate the formation of rosettes between K562 cells and antigen-sensitized E with similar concentration dependences. These results suggest similar ability to bind to Fc gamma RII. The other chimeric Ig do not cause rosettes in this assay system. Hence, both C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 seem to be required for binding to Fc gamma RII, but the C gamma 1-hinge region has no detectable effect.\r"

The ability of these chimeric Ig to stimulate a cellular response (degranulation) in the presence of multivalent Ag was also tested. The epsilon/C gamma 3 was indistinguishable from mIgE in eliciting a high level of degranulation, whereas the other chimeric Ig stimulated no response even when they were preaggregated to enhance their binding avidity. These results demonstrate that C epsilon 4 may be replaced by C gamma 3 without affecting the binding and cell activating properties of mIgE.

We have investigated the effect of PAF on the release of chemical mediators from human basophils of allergic and normal donors. PAF (10 nM to 1 microM) caused a concentration-dependent, noncytotoxic histamine release (greater than or equal to 10% of total) in 27 of 44 subjects tested (24 atopic and 20 nonatopic donors). The release process was either very rapid (t1/2 approximately equal to 10 s) or quite slow (t 1/2 approximately equal to 10 min), temperature- and Ca2(+)-dependent (optimal at 37 degrees C and 5 mM Ca2+). Coincubation of PAF with cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml) enhanced the release of histamine induced by PAF and activated the release process in most donors (42 of 44). Atopics did not release significantly more histamine than normal subjects, and the percentage of PAF responders (greater than or equal to 10% of total) was nearly the same in the two groups. Histamine release was accompanied by the synthesis and release of leukotriene C4, although this lagged 1 to 2 min behind histamine secretion. Lyso-PAF (100 nM to 10 microM), alone or together with cytochalasin B, did not release significant amounts of histamine. The release of histamine activated by PAF was inhibited by the specific PAF receptor antagonist, L-652,731, with an IC50 of 0.4 microM. There was a partial desensitization to PAF when the cells were preincubated with PAF (100 nM to 1 microM) for 2 min in the absence of Ca2+, whereas the cells remained responsive to anti-IgE (0.1 micrograms/ml). If neutrophils were removed from the basophil preparation by a Percoll gradient or a countercurrent elutriation technique, there was a significant decrease in PAF-induced histamine release. PAF (1 microM) was able to induce a very rapid, transient rise (peak less than 10 s) in [Ca2+]i in purified basophils analyzed by digital video microscopy. Finally, among human histamine-containing cells, the basophils are unique in degranulating following a PAF challenge. Mast cells from human lung, skin, or uterus failed to respond to PAF (10 nM to 1 microM) regardless of the presence or absence of cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml). Our results demonstrate that PAF is able to induce the release of inflammatory mediators from human basophils, and that neutrophils can influence this response. It is suggested that PAF-induced basophil activation can play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders.\r"

After 45 min incubation with IgG-coated Sepharose beads the concentrations of cell-associated PAF recovered from normal density eosinophils were significantly greater than from low-density eosinophils or neutrophils. Moreover, eosinophils stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 had a considerably greater capacity to generate PAF than had previously been described. Although the quantities of cell-associated PAF recovered from normal and low density eosinophils and neutrophils after A23187 stimulation were similar, the amounts of extracellular PAF recovered from both eosinophil populations were significantly greater than from neutrophils. The amounts of PAF recovered from the low density eosinophils may not reflect the full synthetic capacity of these cells, because PAF-turnover was found to be more rapid than that observed with normal density eosinophils. When exogenous [3H]PAF was added to the two stimulated eosinophil populations subsequent analysis of the [3H]PAF metabolites by DIOL-HPLC revealed that low density eosinophils incorporated PAF into the phosphatidylcholine (PC) pool more rapidly than did normal density eosinophils or neutrophils. Alkaline hydrolysis of the PC fraction from whole cell extracts followed by treatment with acetic anhydride resulted in all the PC-associated radioactivity being converted to [3H]PAF, confirming PAF incorporation to PC via this pathway. These findings suggest that the contribution of eosinophils to inflammatory processes through the generation of PAF may be greater than previously appreciated, and that Ig-mediated stimulation may be important in initiating generation of the mediator. Low density eosinophils, that are presumed to be similar to tissue eosinophils, may have a role in regulating PAF concentrations in tissues through their enhanced rate of metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is the prototypic human acute phase serum protein. CRP binds to several nuclear Ag including chromatin, histones, and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Binding to sites of tissue inflammation and the nuclei of inflammatory cells has been demonstrated in vivo. We also noticed significant similarity between CRP and nucleoplasmin, a molecule with nuclear localization activity. We therefore decided to test whether CRP was capable of nuclear localization. CRP and the control protein human serum albumin were FITC-conjugated and microinjected into living VERO cells. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees C for 15 min and then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclear localization of CRP but not albumin was rapid and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio was seen, consistent with active nuclear transport. Incubation at reduced temperature inhibited nuclear uptake by CRP. A synthetic peptide, RKSLKK, from the CRP sequence, when coupled to FITC-albumin, also mediated nuclear localization. Nuclear localization of the related protein, serum amyloid P component, was also seen and a homologous nuclear localization signal was identified. Because CRP was previously demonstrated to inhibit RNA transcription and enhance chromatin degradation it is proposed that CRP may play a unique role in injured cells to alter processing of damaged nuclei. Biochemical, structural and sequence comparisons between the CRP/serum amyloid P component family of proteins (pentraxins) and the nucleoplasmin/B23 family of proteins showed regions of sequence homology that may be related to their shared cyclic pentameric structure.\r"

  ".U": "91060973\r", 
  ".W": "In isotonic buffer, IgE receptor-mediated exocytosis from rat basophilic leukemia cells is dependent on extracellular Ca2+, with half-maximal degranulation requiring 0.4 mM Ca2+. No significant exocytosis occurs in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. This absolute requirement for Ca2+ is eliminated by suspending the cells in a hypotonic buffer containing 60 to 80 mM K+; Na+ cannot substitute for K+. Optimal Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis occurs in a buffer containing 20 mM dipotassium Pipes, pH 7.1, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 7 mM Mg acetate, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mM EGTA. The cells maintain this Ca2(+)-independent exocytosis even if they are preincubated with 1 mM EGTA for 40 min at 37 degrees C before triggering. Exocytosis is eliminated as isotonicity is approached by adding sucrose, NaCl, KCl, or potassium glutamate to the buffer. Quin 2 fluorescence measurements reveal only a very small rise in [Ca2+]i when the cells are triggered in hypotonic buffer in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and the presence of 1 mM EGTA. In isotonic buffer, degranulation does not occur under conditions that lead to such a small rise in [Ca2+]i. Sustained IgE receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, which is also Ca2+ dependent in isotonic buffer, becomes independent of Ca2+ in the hypotonic buffer. In fact, the rate of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in hypotonic buffer in the absence of Ca2+ (and presence of 1 mM EGTA) is twice that observed in isotonic buffer in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. These data show that in hypotonic buffer, the requirement of IgE receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis for extracellular Ca2+ is eliminated, and degranulation proceeds with a [Ca2+]i of 0.1 microM, the baseline level of [Ca2+]i found in resting cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in isotonic buffer, the Ca2+ requirement for mast cell degranulation is for the generation of second messengers via hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositols.\r"

  ".W": "Addition of platelet-activating factor (PAF) to human eosinophils leads to the modulation of eosinophil responses. The respiratory burst, induced by opsonized particles, consists of an initiation and a propagation phase and is greatly enhanced (\"primed\") after pretreatment with PAF. This priming event induces the following changes in signal transduction between the opsonin receptors (in particular the CR3 receptor) and activation of the respiratory burst: 1) an enhanced activation of protein kinase C (PK-C): the initiation of the respiratory burst in untreated eosinophils is not sensitive to PK-C inhibition (via staurosporine) and is not accompanied by accumulation of diglycerides and changes in [Ca2+]i. After pretreatment with PAF, the initiation of the response is partly sensitive to inhibition of PK-C (via staurosporine) and is accompanied by accumulation of diglycerides and a fast and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i; and 2) an enhancement of a PK-C-independent initiation of the respiratory burst. The propagation phase in both primed and unprimed cells is sensitive for inhibition by staurosporine. Our results indicate that in eosinophils the phospholipase(s) responsible for the accumulation of the diglycerides and changes in [Ca2+]i during the initiation phase of the serum-treated zymosan response seem(s) to become associated with the signal transduction route only after priming with PAF. This results in the occurrence of two signal transduction routes that can act independently of each other.\r"

We show that among peripheral human blood cells, it is expressed on monocytes, granulocytes, platelets, and a subpopulation of lymphocytes. Activation of granulocytes leads to down-regulation of CD31 molecule expression. Sequence analysis and quantitative measurements of the relatedness of the CD31 molecule to other known proteins demonstrate that it consists of six Ig constant domains and that each domain bears substantial similarity to Fc gamma R domains. We find, however, that the CD31 molecule does not bind Ig Fc domains. On human monocytes we demonstrate that CD31 mAb recognizing certain epitopes of the CD31 molecule induce the generation of reactive oxygen metabolites. No such effect was seen with human granulocytes. By using two CD31 mAb, termed 1B5 and 7E4, we analyzed the requirements for activation of the monocyte respiratory burst via CD31 Ag in more detail. We show that signal transduction occurs via formation of a CD31 Ag-mAb-Fc gamma R complex involving either Fc gamma RI (CD64) or Fc gamma RII (CDw32) molecules.\r"

  ".W": "The polar tuberculoid type (TT) of leprosy, characterized by high T cell reactivity to Mycobacterium leprae, is associated with HLA-DR3. Surprisingly, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness to M. leprae was found in HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patients. This low responsiveness was specifically induced by M. leprae but not by M. tuberculosis and was seen only in patients and not in healthy controls. We studied this patient-specific, M. leprae-induced, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness in depth in one representative HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patient by using T cell clones. From this patient two types of T cell clones were obtained: one type was cross-reactive with M. tuberculosis and recognized an immunodominant epitope (amino acids 3 to 13) on the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp) the other type was M. leprae specific and reacted to a protein other than the 65-kDa one. To examine whether these M. leprae-specific T cell clones were responsible for the DR3-restricted low responsiveness to M. leprae, we tested them for the ability to suppress the proliferation of the DR3-restricted, 65-kDa, hsp-reactive clones. The DR3-restricted, M. leprae-specific T cells completely suppressed the proliferative responses of DR3-restricted, cross-reactive T cell clones to the 65-kDa hsp from the same patient as well as from other individuals. Also, DR3-restricted responses to an irrelevant Ag were suppressed by the M. leprae-specific T cell clones. However, no suppression of non-DR3-restricted T cell responses was seen. Although the mechanism must still be elucidated, this M. leprae-induced, DR3-restricted immunosuppression may at least partly explain the observed DR3-associated low T cell responsiveness in TT leprosy patients.\r"

The immunization induced a high antibody response to GST in contrast to the poor or undetectable response to this Ag observed in naturally infected sheep. Throughout the trial, the progress of the fluke infection was monitored by measuring RBC hemoglobin levels, the extent of liver damage and the fecal egg output in the sheep. This analysis indicated that a subpopulation (n = 4) of the GST vaccinated animals exhibited no anemia, reduced liver damage and a lower mean fecal egg count relative to the infected control group suggesting a lower fluke burden in these animals. Worm burdens in the livers of the GST vaccine group (107 +/- 22) were 57% lower than in the infected control group (250 +/- 25). The subpopulation of the GST vaccine group demonstrated a 78% reduction in mean worm burdens relative to the control group. These results show that GST of adult F. hepatica is a novel Ag that can significantly protect sheep against liver fluke infection. The results suggest that the immune response to GST is directed to the juvenile worm reducing the number of worms that can establish in the liver of the vaccinated animals.\r"

Using sera from patients infected with Onchocerca volvulus, we analyzed both the entire paramyosin molecule and six subcloned fragments for their IgG, IgG subclasses, and IgE responses. Patients from both Guatemala (64% positive) and Ghana (100% positive) reacted to paramyosin with specific IgG levels above normal controls. Although there was no anti-paramyosin subclass restriction common to all patients, the IgG3 response in the Ghananians was significantly greater than that of Guatemalans (p less than 0.001). IgE anti-paramyosin responses showed positive correlations with IgG2 (p less than 0.001), IgG4 (p less than 0.002), and IgG1 (p less than 0.04) responses. Epitope mapping using the IgG response to the six subclones demonstrated preferential recognition of the amino terminal end of the molecule (nucleotides 1 to 360). IgG2 reactivity was clearly localized to the most amino-terminal 120 amino acids, and the IgG4 antibodies recognized amino acids immediately adjacent to this fragment. These studies examining the fine specificity of anti-filarial immune reactions should provide a method for understanding how parasites either evade or induce host immune responses.\r"

We have identified a new glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored lymphocyte Ag, B7, by using a mAb and have determined the primary structure by cDNA cloning. B7 Ag was expressed on the majority, if not all, of the mature lymphocytes of both T and B lineages, including strongly CD3+ thymocytes, most splenic T cells, and approximately 60% of splenic IgM+ B cells, whereas the expression of B7 Ag on bone marrow cells was negligible. The expression of B7 Ag was nearly completely abolished with as little as 2 mU of PI-specific phospholipase C per ml, which did not completely eliminate Ly-6C and Thy-1 expression. Unlike the expression of other GPI-linked lymphocyte Ag, the expression of B7 was rapidly down-regulated upon the activation of T cells by mitogens or IL-2 both in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that B7 Ag was an approximately 12-kDa protein. With a CDM8 expression vector, a cDNA encoding B7 Ag was cloned, and it was confirmed that the B7 Ag on cDNA-transfected cells was indeed PI-specific phospholipase C sensitive. The B7 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 222 bp including a typical N-terminal leader sequence and a characteristic sequence at the C terminus encoding hydrophobic amino acids. A computer search revealed no significant homology to any known molecule at both DNA and amino acid sequence levels. Northern blot analysis indicated that the B7 transcript was expressed on lymphohematopoietic tissues, including thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, but not on other organs, such as liver, kidney, and brain. The results indicated that B7 Ag is a new member of the GPI-anchored proteins which is selectively expressed on mature resting but not activated lymphocytes.\r"

We have proposed that the extracellular portions of the membrane anchor peptides of mIg can be used as antigenic sites for isotype-specific targeting of B cells. Clones containing the genes of human Ig alpha 1 or alpha 2 subclasses were isolated from a genomic DNA library. The gene segments encoding the membrane peptides and their flanking regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, subcloned into plasmid pUC19, and the DNA sequences were determined. Human alpha 1 and alpha 2 genes, like murine alpha gene, each has only one membrane exon. The sequences of the human alpha 1 and alpha 2 genes are almost identical in the membrane peptide-coding region. The mRNA from a human mIgA-expressing B cell line, DAKIKI, was isolated, its cDNA prepared, and the segments spanning the membrane peptide-coding region and a part of the constant domain 3 amplified by polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequences revealed that there are two isoforms of alpha 1-chain, resulting from the alternative splicing of the third constant domain of H chain to two acceptor sites in the membrane exon. One isoform has a segment of 32 and the other 26 amino acid residues in the extracellular portion of the membrane peptide. These segments may serve as isotype-specific antigenic epitopes for antibody targeting of mIgA-bearing B cells.\r"

Spleens of immune mice contain T cells that proliferate in response to idiotypic IgM. However, idiotypic Ag is presented to the T cells most efficiently in its natural form at the surface of the lymphoma cells, than as soluble IgM plus presenting cells. Variant tumors that display either little or no idiotypic IgM at the cell surface, but which are otherwise indistinguishable from parental tumor, induce a weak response or fail to stimulate the T cells, respectively. Anti-idiotypic lines and clones have been derived from the splenic T cells by growth in the presence of irradiated tumor cells. Phenotypic analysis revealed that cells from both lines and clones express CD3 and CD4 Ag, but not CD8. Recognition of tumor Id, which required no added presenting cells, was inhibited by antibody against MHC class II Ag, and variably by anti-CD4. Proliferative responses were inhibited by anti-idiotypic antibodies, but also by antibodies against the constant region of the mu H chain, indicating that perturbation of the surface IgM abrogates availability of idiotypic determinants to the T cells.\r"

This heat-sensitive inhibitory activity is readily lost on dilution of serum, revealing the presence of erythropoietin-potentiating activity. Inhibitory activity is caused by a rapid cytotoxic effect on rabbit bone marrow cells; mouse cells are less sensitive. Cytotoxic activity is removed from serum by adsorption to protein A, is not expressed at 4 degrees C, and is neutralized by anti-C3c complement antibody. Cytotoxicity is inhibited by EGTA; the effect of EGTA is reversed by addition of Ca2+ ions. These findings show that cytotoxicity is exerted through an antibody via the classical pathway of complement-dependent cell lysis. Although serum from healthy, adult human donors consistently contains cytotoxic activity, no such activity is observed in most serum samples from neonates, parturients, and patients with severe anemia. Patients with polycythemia or chronic renal failure occasionally lack cytotoxic activity in their serum. Serum samples lacking cytotoxic activity were found to be deficient in the antibody component in 34 out of 35 cases examined. These results show that an antibody directed against rabbit cells is constitutively present in normal human serum but is absent in a number of pathologic situations as well as being absent in neonates and parturients.\r"

The minimum and maximum reference values were established for the different subgroups of subjects as follows: for females under 40 years and males over 40, reference values were considered as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles from the adjusted lognormal distribution; for females over 40 years and males under 40, reference values were considered as the exponential transformation of the upper and lower limits of the 95% prediction intervals for the log of serum ferritin for each particular age point.\r"

  ".W": "Serum samples from 398 individuals (270 whites and 128 blacks) exhibiting quantitatively normal amounts of five typically seen fractions (albumin, alpha 1-globulin, alpha 2-globulin, beta-globulin, and gamma-globulin) in serum protein electrophoresis and showing no evidence of multiple myeloma, other immunoproliferative diseases, or any of the other diseases known to produce monoclonal proteins were tested for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by immunofixation electrophoresis. No individual in the study had a serum protein electrophoresis pattern suggestive of monoclonal protein gammopathy. Except for one 37-year-old woman, all subjects were men. Subjects were divided into seven age groups: 20 to 29 years (I), 30 to 39 years (II), 40 to 49 years (III), 50 to 59 years (IV), 60 to 69 years (V), 70 to 79 years (VI), and all over 79 years (VII) of age. Considering all subjects in a given race, blacks had two times (14.8%) higher incidence of MGUS than whites (7.8%); this difference was statistically significant. An increased incidence of MGUS in blacks when compared with whites prevailed in each age group, and the difference was statistically significant in all age groups except group II. No MGUS was found in groups I and III in either race. Both races showed a threefold increase in incidence of MGUS from group II to group VII. No routine laboratory test such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate in subjects with MGUS was significantly different than that in age- and race-matched individuals without MGUS. These results show that the incidence of MGUS is higher in the group (blacks) also known to have a higher prevalence of multiple myeloma.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the effect of sodium on cardiac hemodynamics, sodium chloride was added to nonionic contrast media to a 0.9% concentration and was compared with the standard media iohexol, iopamidol, and ioversol. Left coronary angiography was performed in 10 closed-chest, atrial-paced dogs with 10 ml injections of each preparation in a randomized and blinded fashion. The maximum changes in left ventricular systolic pressure, mean aortic pressure, left ventricular and diastolic pressure, and maximal rise of left ventricular pressure were measured. The left ventricular systolic pressure and mean aortic pressure decreased by 17 +/- 7 mm Hg and by 12 +/- 5 mm Hg with iohexol plus 0.9% NaCl, but only by 5 +/- 4 mm Hg and by 4 +/- 3 mm Hg with iohexol alone (p less than 0.001). The left ventricular and end diastolic pressure increased by 2.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg with iohexol plus 0.9% NaCl, but did not change with iohexol alone (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular dp/dt decreased by 204 +/- 161 mm Hg/sec with iohexol plus 0.9% NaCl but increased by 392 +/- 122 mm Hg/sec with iohexol alone (p less than 0.001). Similar results were obtained from experiments with iopamidol versus iopamidol plus 0.9% NaCl and ioversol versus ioversol plus 0.9% NaCl. Ioversol plus 5% dextrose or ioversol plus 2.1% choline chloride (isomolar to ioversol plus 0.9% NaCl) produced a significant increase in left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular dp/dt (versus ioversol plus 0.9% NaCl, p less than 0.001). Thus, sodium, but not the osmolality or chloride, contributed to the negative inotropic effect of the contrast media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91061029\r", 
  ".W": "Numerous studies suggest that platelets may contribute to preservation of normal endothelial cell permeability in models of lung injury. We have previously shown that washed human platelets prevent xanthine oxidase-induced edema in the isolated perfused lung and that protective mechanisms depend on the platelet glutathione redox cycle. It is uncertain, however, whether platelets preserve endothelial function by reducing toxic oxygen metabolites or by aggregating and releasing endothelial cell supportive factors-an activity that may require the glutathione redox cycle. In this study, we present data demonstrating that platelet prevention of oxidant lung injury occurs independent of platelet aggregation and release. Isolated rabbit lungs perfused with a cell-free medium were instilled with purine (2 mmol/L) and xanthine oxidase (0.003 U/ml) to generate oxidant lung edema. The infusion of washed human platelets (1 x 10(10) cells) prevented lung edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, and lung histology. Incubation of platelets with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and release, did not inhibit platelet attenuation of lung edema. Additionally, with the instillation of PGE1 into the perfusate to further inhibit platelet aggregation, no prevention of lung protection by PGE1-treated platelets was seen when these results were compared with those from studies in which lungs were infused with xanthine oxidase and PGE1. Aggregometry studies documented that the inhibitory effect of PGE1 on platelet aggregation persisted for up to 60 minutes, which was the duration of the isolated lung protocol. We conclude that platelet aggregation and release of platelet factors is not required for platelet attenuation of oxidant lung edema.\r"

  ".U": "91061031\r", 
  ".W": "Eicosanoids are important mediators of the destructive arthropathy observed in rheumatoid arthritis. The rate-limiting step in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway is the availability of free arachidonic acid. The phospholipase enzymes release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and thus play an important role in the regulation of eicosanoid production. We have previously demonstrated enhanced phospholipase A2 and C enzyme activities in cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and have also described a phospholipase A2 activating protein (PLAP) in mammalian cell lines. In an attempt to determine the biochemical basis of enhanced phospholipase A2 activity found in patients with inflammatory joint disease, we examined synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis for PLAP. To determine whether PLAP was specific for rheumatoid disease, we assayed specimens from patients with other arthropathies. Histologic examination of rheumatoid joint tissue, with the use of immunohistochemical techniques, demonstrated high concentration of PLAP in monocytes, macrophages, chondrocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. Human PLAP could be biochemically isolated from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and was found to be similar to PLAP previously isolated from murine and bovine sources. To determine whether PLAP could directly mediate any aspect of inflammatory disease, purified PLAP was injected into rabbit knee joints. This resulted in an acute inflammatory arthritis with synovial cell proliferation and synovial fluid leukocytosis. Purified PLAP also induced eicosanoid formation both in vivo and in vitro. With enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we found more PLAP in synovial fluid specimens from patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with samples from patients with other inflammatory arthropathies as well as osteoarthritis, a noninflammatory arthropathy. These data suggest that PLAP may be responsible, at least in part, for some aspects of the destructive inflammatory arthropathy that is observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "The most common method of blood sample collection for neonatal screening programs for inherited diseases-blood spots on filter paper--is poorly suited for screening of sickle cell diseases by conventional assays because of the denaturing effects of this medium on hemoglobins that affect their electrophoretic identifications. The monoclonal antibody beta 6-1 specifically recognizes the hemoglobin A beta-chain residue 6 (glutamic acid), that is, the normal counterpart of hemoglobins S and C, and this recognition is unaffected by changes in hemoglobins induced by filter paper storage. The beta 6-1 immunoassay analysis of 67 prescreened samples extracted from filter paper permitted unambiguous group identification, by virtue of nonreactivity, of the pathologic sickle cell disease phenotypes SS (sickle cell anemia) and SC (sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease), along with the homozygous hemoglobin C phenotype (hemoglobin CC disease). Other phenotypes identified by beta 6-1 nonreactivity would include S-beta degrees thalassemia, C-beta degrees thalassemia, and beta degrees thalassemia (Cooley's anemia). As systems for collecting newborn blood specimens on filter paper and their transmittal to centralized laboratories are already established in many states, this assay for sickle cell and hemoglobin C diseases could rapidly be combined with other mass screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism.\r"

The antithrombin activity may be due to thrombomodulin or to activation of antithrombin III by glycosaminoglycans or thrombomodulin, or possibly a combination of these. This inhibitory activity has been shown to be affected by such antiheparin agents as protamine, hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene; Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.) and platelet factor 4, as well as by such enzymes as heparinase and heparitinase. We have used a hamster cheek pouch preparation to observe thrombus formation in vivo in a normal vascular flow, to determine whether the production of thrombi by thrombin can be enhanced by antiheparin agents. After intra-arterial injection or topical application of protamine or hexadimethrine bromide, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on intact arteriolar endothelium was produced by a dose of thrombin, which when injected alone had no effect. No thrombi were found in venules or capillaries. Injection of heparin before or after the antiheparin agents necessitated a larger dose to enhance the action of thrombin. On electron microscopy the thrombi were found to consist primarily of platelets adherent to an intact endothelium. The possible clinical implications of these observations are discussed.\r"

Washed red cells resuspended at a hematocrit of 0.4 were exposed to a submaximal therapeutic level of 250 ng/ml of carbon 14-labeled primaquine. The tracer was recovered quantitatively in separated plasma and red cells. Over 75% of the total labeled drug was found in red cells suspended in saline solution, but only 10% to 30% in red cells suspended in plasma. The plasma effect was not mediated by albumin. Studies with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, an agent that displaces AGP-bound drugs, and cord blood known to have decreased AGP established that primaquine binds to physiologic amounts of the glycoprotein in plasma. Red cell primaquine concentration increased linearly as AGP level fell and as the free drug fraction rose. We suggest that clinical blood levels of primaquine include the red cell fraction or whole blood level because (1) erythrocytic primaquine is a sizable and highly variable component of the total drug in blood; (2) this component reflects directly the free drug in plasma, and inversely the extent of binding to AGP; (3) the amount of free primaquine may influence drug transport into specific tissues in vivo; and (4) fluctuations of AGP, an acute-phase reactant that increases greatly in patients with malaria and other infections, markedly affect the partition of primaquine in blood. Because AGP binds many basic drugs, unrecognized primaquine-drug interactions may exist.\r"

  ".U": "91061037\r", 
  ".W": "Murine platelet production is normally supported by high-ploidy bone marrow megakaryocytes without significant contribution from splenic megakaryocytes with predominantly low-ploidy levels. We produced sustained bone marrow ablation using radiostrontium, and examined the processes by which splenic platelet production is initiated and maintained in the absence of bone marrow function. Bone marrow hematopoiesis, measured by total nucleated cell number and viability, megakaryocyte colony-forming cells, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, was rapidly ablated in mice by using yttrium 90-free strontium 90. Platelet count declined from normal (1224 x 10(3)/microliters) to a nadir (98 x 10(3)/microliters) 11 days after 90Sr, and then rose to a stable level (705 x 10(3)/microliters) on days 20 through 115. Peripheral leukocyte concentration decreased rapidly and remained below 25% of normal in contrast to hemoglobin levels, which were minimally lowered. Mean spleen weight rose rapidly after 90Sr to 66% above normal. Splenic megakaryocyte frequency, measured by two-color fluorescence-activated flow cytometry, rose from basal levels (0.09% +/- 0.06%) to 0.15% +/- 0.07% (p less than 0.001), total spleen nucleated cells fell to 71% of normal, and the absolute number of spleen megakaryocytes was unchanged. Total spleen megakaryocyte colony-forming cells were not significantly increased above normal whereas total spleen granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells increased abruptly after day 13 to 10 times normal levels. Splenectomy after hematopoietic recovery from 90Sr bone marrow ablation resulted in a rapid decline of platelet levels, followed by death. Although the spleen became the sole site of platelet production, the splenic megakaryocyte ploidy distribution was only minimally changed from normal, and the modal ploidy class remained 2N. In contrast to experimental thrombocytopenia in mice with intact bone marrow, in which megakaryocyte ploidy is increased, thrombocytopenia associated with sustained bone marrow ablation does not result in upward regulation of splenic megakaryocyte ploidy as a compensatory mechanism.\r"

An improvement in the audiological threshold was found in 51 per cent, 24 per cent were unchanged, the remaining 25 per cent suffered a deterioration which was seen both immediately post-operatively and thereafter until reviewed in the special clinic. The age at operation, size of the perforation, grade of surgeon carrying out the operation and prior adenoidectomy had no statistically significant influence on the success rate or the audiological outcome. Revision procedures achieved similar graft take rates to the initial procedures but fared worse audiologically. We conclude that in the majority the operation was successful but hearing gain was not as good as expected and subject to late deterioration. A long term follow-up is important to detect this and other complications.\r"

The majority of the foreign bodies (FBs) were organic (378/400, 94.5 per cent). The results showed that mainstem bronchial foreign bodies were diagnosed correctly in 68 per cent of cases compared with 65 per cent correct diagnoses with segmental bronchial foreign bodies, but only 22 per cent correct diagnoses with tracheal, and 0 per cent correct diagnosis in those with laryngeal foreign bodies. Eighty per cent (32/40) of the children with laryngotracheal FBs had normal X-ray findings, whereas 67.7 per cent (205/303) of the children with bronchial FBs had abnormal chest X-ray findings. The most common positive radiological signs in the children with tracheobronchial FBs were obstructive emphysema (131/213, 62 per cent) and mediastinal shift (117/213, 55 per cent). The incidence of major complications was related not only to the size of the foreign body and its location but also the duration since aspiration. The most common types of bronchial obstructions by airway FBs are discussed.\r"

Fifty-four patients were studied of whom 51 had a head and neck tumour. All patients were examined and then imaged using Tc99m(v) DMSA scintigraphy and computerized tomography. Scintigraphy was less sensitive than clinical examination in the detection of patients with cancer, patients with primary tumours and patients with metastatic neck disease. CT was as sensitive and as accurate as clinical examination but more sensitive than Tc99m(v) DMSA in detecting patients with cancer and with primary tumours. CT was more sensitive and more accurate than both clinical examination and Tc99m(v) DMSA scintigraphy in predicting which patients had metastatic neck disease. Although Tc99m(v) DMSA is accumulated by squamous cell carcinoma, its inability to detect low volume disease and apparent low specificity means it has no role to play in the management of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

The prevalence of infection in this population was 12%. Sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott TestPack Chlamydia were 51.7% and 99.5%, respectively, and of the Kodak Surecell Chlamydia were 76.7% and 98.6%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for TestPack were 93.9% and 93.8%, and for Surecell were 88.5% and 96.9%, respectively. Additionally, an in vitro investigation was used to evaluate whether typical office staff (physicians, nurses, medical technicians, receptionists, and radiology technicians) were able to perform competently the tests in each kit. Office personnel tested 12 dilutions of a C trachomatis stock sample or negative control sample as unknowns for each kit in the in vitro investigation. There were no differences among office staff in performance when compared for each test kit. Selective use of these enzyme immunoassay tests for high-risk patients in a family practice population that has a high prevalence of patients with C trachomatis infection may be helpful when rapid test results are required and cultures are not feasible. After appropriate training, most physician office personnel were equally able to perform the enzyme immunoassay tests evaluated.\r"

Optimal use of these radiographs requires that patients are appropriately selected, that the examination is adequately conducted, and that the films are accurately interpreted. Interpretive accuracy is enhanced if radiographs are analyzed by physicians skilled in observing and interpreting them and if the images are examined in a logical, systematic manner to minimize observer bias. A systematic search pattern is proposed to facilitate family physicians' interpretations for the most common office radiographs: chest, extremities, abdomen, skull, and spine.\r"

All serum cholesterol levels measured between July 1, 1988, and September 30, 1988, were reviewed. Patients were classified as normal, borderline, or hypercholesterolemic based on serum cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk factors. Patients previously recognized to be hypercholesterolemic were excluded. Six months later, medical record reviews were performed for the 192 hypercholesterolemic and 107 borderline hypercholesterolemic patients. Only 39 of the hypercholesterolemic patients (20%) had received appropriate dietary therapy and follow-up. Patient compliance with physician recommendations was excellent. There was minimal unnecessary testing or treatment of borderline hypercholesterolemia. Low rates of appropriate management of hypercholesterolemia may be related to inadequate physician knowledge, low physician-perceived self-efficacy regarding dietary counseling, or time constraints.\r"

For white cohort members, an increased risk of premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity, spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents is a cause for concern and should be further investigated.\r"

A common belief among many physicians is that such efforts will not deter their patients from smoking. Others believe the time commitment required for a successful intervention is excessive. The present study addressed the above issues by examining the effect of a 3- to 5-minute unstructured physician discussion encouraging smoking cessation with family practice patients. Cigarette-smoking patients of two busy family practices in southeast Michigan were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving routine care or an intervention group receiving, in addition to routine care, smoking cessation counseling from their physician. A third comparison group was drawn from smokers in practices not involved in delivering the intervention. Two hundred thirty-eight patients from the intervention group, 178 from the control group, and 47 from the comparison group were followed up with a telephone interview at 6 months. Intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (P less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. At the 6-month follow-up, 8% of intervention group members, and 4% of both the comparison and control groups reportedly were abstinent from smoking. Among those contacted at the 1-year follow-up, the respective percentages abstinent were 8%, 3%, and 4%. Although these differences in quit rates were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that physicians can positively affect patient smoking cessation. This intervention was feasible in busy family practices, highlighting its generalizability and applicability to other family practice settings in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders have become a widespread part of modern medical practice. This study examined patient experience and decision-making preferences regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A random sample of 800 outpatients (one half aged over 70 years) was surveyed by questionnaire, with a 51% response rate. While only 11% of patients had ever discussed resuscitation with a physician, 67% had thought about the issue, and 44% had discussed it with someone other than a physician. Patients overwhelmingly preferred to preserve a good quality of life, even if it meant not living longer (93.9%). When asked who they would have help them with DNR decisions, physicians were most often selected, while spouses were the most valued advisors. In a series of scenarios such factors as dementia, drug or alcohol use, age, and pain had a significant effect on a patient's decision about resuscitation. Discussions about DNR issues in the outpatient setting should be encouraged, as patient interest is strong, and greater physician awareness of patients' values and preferences can prevent unwanted resuscitation in the acute setting.\r"

Criteria for evaluating proposals that aim to improve the financial support of primary care programs include the financial, administrative, and educational implications of the options as well as the views of interested stakeholders. Other sources of funding for primary care GME are changes in existing Medicare payments; increased categorical GME funding, ambulatory payment, and grants; commitments from future employers; and redistribution of current funds. Alternatives for spending these funds to aid primary care programs include dividing the sources in three ways: on a per-resident basis, by competitive grants, or by incentives for primary care education. An analysis of the alternatives for changing GME financing shows that several solutions will be needed simultaneously.\r"

Counseling patients on HIV risk reduction should be part of the HIV risk interview. An understanding of the benefits and contraindications of testing, as well as a respect for the impact of testing, is important. All HIV-seropositive individuals should undergo a complete history and review of symptoms as soon as test results are known. Judicious use of laboratory testing, including monitoring of CD4 cell counts, is recommended. Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and zidovudine therapy should be offered to patients with appropriately low CD4 counts.\r"

It is a heuristic device for organizing research in the neuroimmunology and virology of schizophrenia. This approach is different from other immune and viral theories of schizophrenia and defines testable hypotheses for further theory refinement or rejection. Defective alpha-interferon (aIFN) regulation resulting in excessive effect is postulated to cause schizophrenia. The role of aIFN in the regulation of development and its induction within the brain by the reactivation of viruses that are commonly present in the normal central nervous system (CNS) are the primary pathophysiological mechanisms. Biological properties of aIFN include neural excitation, opiate and adrenocorticotropic hormone activity, and inhibition of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Psychosis results from in situ viral stimulation of aIFN production in the CNS of a vulnerable host having defective regulation of either sensitivity or production. Negative symptoms result from aIFN effects on CNS development and the behavioral toxicity of aIFN. Biological developmental abnormalities, gender differences in severity, and decline in psychotic symptoms with age are discussed in the context of the theory. Research strategies and specific testable hypotheses are presented.\r"

We compared patients along two dimensions: a) whether they admitted or denied deviant sexual behavior, and b) whether they faced legal charges for sex offenses. Results indicated the following: a) Patients who denied deviant sexual behavior were significantly more likely to minimize psychopathology than were those who admitted to deviant sexual behavior (p less than .05). b) Patients facing no active legal charges showed significantly more psychopathology than did those facing legal charges (p less than .05). c) The most frequent forms of psychopathology shown by these patients were antisocial attitudes, depression, somatization, and cognitive disorganization. These findings suggest that many alleged sex offenders may experience, and deny, severe psychopathology in addition to their sexual disorders. Clinicians should be alert to subtle signs of psychopathology when evaluating alleged sex offenders who deny deviant sexual behavior, because these patients may be especially likely to minimize symptoms.\r"

The EDRS also has potential as a measurement of state-related changes in affective behavior and as a technique for examining treatment response.\r"

In contrast, there was a negligible association between these enzymes in 90 nonpsychiatric inpatient control subjects. Patients with mania (229.0 +/- 106.1 IU/l) showed significantly (t = 3.16, p less than .002, two-tailed) higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels than control subjects (191 +/- 41.7 IU/l) and a 14% incidence of abnormally high serum LDH levels vs. 1% among control subjects. Results were unchanged when patients taking neuroleptics were excluded. These results indicate that psychiatric illness, especially mania, induces release of LDH and SGOT, occasionally to unusually high levels. This is similar to previous reports of muscle creatine phosphokinase release in psychiatric patients. Presumably, these enzymes are released from skeletal muscle in association with agitation, with muscle tension, or with blood stasis and local tissue hypoxia consequent to hypoactivity.\r"

The main results were 1) that schizophrenics were significantly inferior to the normal group, but equivalent to manics and depressives on emotional prosody comprehension; 2) schizophrenics were significantly inferior to all other groups on emotional prosody expression; and 3) all four groups were equivalently proficient on stress prosody comprehension and expression.

The infarct also involved the lateral and dorsal medulla when the mPICA supplied all or part of these regions. Three clinical patterns were observed: 1) pseudolabyrinthine signs with or without dysmetria and ataxia when the medulla was spared; marked axial lateropulsion was present in most cases; 2) complete or incomplete Wallenberg's syndrome, when the medulla was involved; 3) silent infarction. These syndromes are precisely those previously attributed to PICA occlusion without distinction of the branch involved. No alteration of consciousness was recorded and spontaneous recovery was the rule. Cerebellar infarction in the distribution of the mPICA can be regarded as a benign condition with a good prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "Microneurography was performed in median nerve sensory fascicles with concentric needle electrodes and with conventional tungsten microneedles. The latter electrodes preferentially recorded activity from the myelinated fibres in the whole fascicle. By contrast, due to its special design, a concentric needle can record activity selectively from even a small part of a fascicle. High amplitude signals in C fibres can be discriminated close to Schwann cells that envelope unmyelinated axons. Apart from being biased for activity in thin fibres, the concentric needles can also record signals from nearby myelinated fibres. The palmar receptive fields of such fibre groups were not congruent with the areas traditionally attributed to multiunit skin afferents in humans, namely the innervation zone(s) of one or two adjacent digital nerve(s). Instead, the multiunit fields often comprised small parts of a digital nerve innervation area, frequently only the pulp of a finger. Single units were always localised within previously screened multiunit areas. Contrary to some previously accepted tenets it is probable that single unit activity in myelinated fibres in these studies is recorded extra-axonally near to a node of Ranvier. The findings also suggest the presence of a somatotopy in human limb nerve fascicles, comparable to that previously established in the spinal cord and the somatosensory cortex.\r"

Six patients were included in a double blind crossover trial (maximal dose 24 mg/day). The patients were evaluated on both their spasticity and locomotor function. Four of the patients also participated in an open trial in which cyproheptadine was administered for a minimum of six months at optimal dose. Patients walked on a treadmill at full weight bearing when possible, or with 40% of their body weight externally supported, as required, by an overhead harness system. Cyproheptadine considerably decreased the sustained ankle clonus and episodes of spontaneous spasms observed in all the patients who previously presented these manifestations of spasticity. Two patients who required body weight support (BWS) during locomotion could walk at full weight bearing during cyproheptadine therapy. A more normal timing of EMG patterns in these patients during cyproheptadine therapy was associated with temporal distance changes and marked improvement of joint angular displacement. In contrast, the other patients showed marginal changes in the EMG and the kinematic pattern but eventually managed to walk at a higher speed. These preliminary results suggest that cyproheptadine can reduce spasticity and enhance locomotor function in spinal cord injured patients.\r"

  ".W": "Frequency of firing and regularity of discharge of human motor units, and short term synchrony between pairs of motor units, have been assessed in extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in control subjects and in clinically complete paraplegic subjects. The discharge pattern of TA motor units in paraplegia ranged from extremely regular to very irregular for different motor units whereas in the control population, and in EDC of both groups, there was a narrow, but intermediate, range of regularity. There was little difference in the incidence and degree of short term synchrony (STS) in EDC between paraplegic and normal subjects. In contrast, virtually no STS of motor units was observed in the TA muscles of the paraplegic group whereas control subjects exhibited approximately the same amount of STS in their TA and EDC muscles. It is concluded that the extra burden placed on arm muscles in paraplegia does not change the amount of synchronisation between motor units. Furthermore, section of the spinal cord does not increase STS as predicted from lesions of the reticulospinal tract in cats. This may reflect the coincidental removal of supraspinal synchronising inputs of motoneurons or the reorganisation of synaptic inputs in chronic paraplegia.\r"

  ".W": "Cervical motor roots and the brachial plexus were excited transcutaneously with magnetic (MagStim) and electrical stimulation (ElStim) applied dorsally over the spine and over the supraclavicular fossa (Erb's point). The compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and the biceps muscles (BICEPS) could be evoked with either stimulating technique in all 52 subjects tested. With MagStim over the spinous process C7, greater CMAPs were obtained from ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001, paired t test) and BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.005) when the inducing current in the coil as viewed from behind was clockwise for the right arm and vice versa. ElStim with the cathode over C7/T1 and the anode directed cranially provided greater CMAPs from the ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001) and smaller CMAPs from the BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.01) than with the inverse polarity. MagStim of the cervical roots provided CMAPs which were smaller from ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001), and greater from BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.0001), than ElStim (cathode C7/T1), whereas latencies did not differ significantly (p less than or equal to 0.3). When comparing ElStim and MagStim applied over Erb's point, the former yielded greater CMAPs and 0.5 ms longer latencies from both the ADM and BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.001). From these data and additional studies in four patients, including direct intraoperative root stimulation in one of them, it is concluded that ElStim and MagStim over the spine excite the motor roots at a similar site, that is, within a few cm outside the intervertebral foramina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis.\r"

The single-stage commissurotomy in all four patients included the anterior commissures and two-thirds or four-fifths section of the corpus callosum with sparing of the splenium. There was no demonstrable ability to transfer hand posture in these patients. This was the major evidence for functional deconnexion. A newly learned task of one-hand knotting revealed right hand impairment in all four patients. There was no dyspraxia in the right hand for over-learned object-handling tasks in these patients. It is suggested that there might be right hemisphere specialisation for the initial acquisition of unimanual object-handling skills and that the spared callosal fibres in the splenium alone are insufficient to mediate task control under these conditions. This is supported by the finding that one of these patients, who was the only one who had a right parietal lesion, was unable to perform the newly learned task with either hand.\r"

It is concluded that subclinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common, at least in patients with CIDP in the United Kingdom, but that clinically evident signs of CNS disease are infrequent. The association of a multiple sclerosis-like syndrome with CIDP is rare.\r"

(2) When is the appropriate time for referral to a liver transplant center? (3) Does breast-feeding prevent chronic liver disease? (4) What is the incidence of severe liver disease in family members? Our analysis revealed that the initial values of alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, and trypsin inhibitory capacity may have prognostic value. During clinical follow-up the recurrence or persistence of hyperbilirubinemia along with deteriorating results of coagulation studies indicated the need for liver transplantation because of imminent poor outcome. Girls had a worse prognosis than boys. Initial breast-feeding versus feeding of commercial formulas did not influence overall overcome. The incidence of significant liver disease among \"at risk\" siblings was 21% (3/14); if one assumes mendelian inheritance from heterozygous parents, the overall risk for siblings in our families was 5%.\r"

Three features were notable in WPW: no Q wave in left chest leads (88%), PR interval less than 100 milliseconds (80%), and left axis deviation (33%). In subtle WPW these findings were similar: 79%, 67%, and 46%, respectively. By comparison, 5% of control subjects had no Q wave, 16% had a PR interval of less than 100 milliseconds, and 4% had left axis deviation (all p less than 0.001). The coexistence of two of these features was common (74%) in WPW and subtle WPW (63%) but rare (2%) in control subjects (p less than 0.001). A PR interval of less than 100 milliseconds was less specific before 1 year of age, but 89% of patients with WPW had a QRS duration of greater than 80 milliseconds versus 2% of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Obvious WPW disappeared later in 11 patients; however, left axis deviation or lack of a Q wave persisted in eight (p less than 0.01). We conclude that the diagnosis of WPW in children, even when subtle, is suggested by the presence of these four changes. Preexcitation may persist in some patients in whom overt delta waves are no longer present.\r"

The incidence of SIDS was studied in 2143 infants of substance-abusing mothers (ISAM) born in Los Angeles County during 1986 and 1987 who were reported to the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services because of a history of drug exposure or positive urine test results in the mother, infant, or both. By comparing the ISAM birth reports with records of autopsy-proven SIDS in Los Angeles County, we found 19 SIDS cases in the population of 2143 ISAM, a SIDS rate of 8.87 cases per 1000 ISAM (95% confidence interval 5.3 to 13.8). This was significantly higher than the SIDS rate for the non-ISAM general population: 396 SIDS deaths among 325,372 live births, an incidence rate of 1.22 cases per 1000 births, p less than 0.00001. The age of ISAM at death was 99 +/- 63 (mean +/- SD) days compared with 91 +/- 52 days for the non-ISAM population (not significant). The incidence of SIDS was significantly greater in male infants, during the winter months, in black infants, and in non-Hispanic white infants in the non-ISAM population. Such differences were not observed in the ISAM group. A greater incidence of symptomatic apnea was reported before SIDS for the ISAM than for the non-ISAM population (22% vs 5.4%, p = 0.022). We conclude that ISAM have a higher incidence of SIDS than the non-ISAM general population. However, it was not possible to separate maternal substance abuse from other confounding variables that may also have had an impact on SIDS risk in the ISAM group.\r"

The diagnosis of atopic disease was established by history, physical examination, total serum IgE concentration, and the results of prick skin tests or radioallergosorbent tests or both, and then compared with the result of the Phadiatop Paediatric test for each patient. One hundred two patients (62 boys) between the ages of 4 months and 7.3 years were enrolled (median age 3.2 years). After the history and physical examination, 42% of the patients were believed to be atopic and 32% to be nonatopic; the diagnosis was uncertain in 26%. Skin prick test reactions to a variety of foods and inhalants were positive in 41 of 63 children tested; results of radioallergosorbent tests were positive in 35 of 61 children. Overall, atopy was diagnosed in 53 children and 49 were found to be nonatopic. When the clinical diagnosis was used as the gold standard, the Phadiatop test resulted in a correct diagnosis of atopy in 49 of 53 cases and of no atopy in 43 of 49 cases: sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 88%, and efficiency = 90%. Although the Phadiatop Paediatric test does not indicate specific sensitivities, it provides the clinician with a useful screening test for atopic disease in children 7 years of age or less, and the researcher with a means of validating atopic populations.\r"

  ".U": "91061190\r", 
  ".W": "To determine how accurately several methods of height prediction estimate adult height, we compared height predictions calculated by the Bayley-Pinneau, Roche-Wainer-Thissen (RWT), target height, and Tanner-Whitehouse Mark I (TW-MI), and Mark II (TW-MII) methods with final adult height in 37 boys and 32 girls with short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty. They were first seen at a chronologic age (mean +/- SD) of 14.80 +/- 1.70 years (boys) and 12.87 +/- 2.56 years (girls). Adult height at 23.14 +/- 1.95 years and 21.05 +/- 2.02 years was 170.4 +/- 5.4 cm (boys) and 157.8 +/- 4.2 cm (girls), respectively, and thus within the lower range of normal. Height predictions were calculated for the total group and for patients with parents of normal (group 1) as well as short stature (group 2). For boys, the RWT method gave very accurate results, underestimating adult height by -0.6 cm for the total group. The prediction errors for the other methods were -7.3 cm (TW-MI), -4.2 cm (TW-MII), and +3.1 cm (Bayley-Pinneau method) or +1.7 cm (target height). For girls, no method was superior in estimating adult height. The mean prediction error was -0.8 cm, -2.1 cm, and -1.8 cm with the Bayley-Pinneau, TW-MI, and TW-MII methods, respectively. In contrast, adult height was overpredicted by +2.3 cm and +1.2 cm with the RWT and target height methods. We conclude that patients with short stature and constitutional delay of growth and puberty reach an adult height in the lower range of normal. Height prediction methods differ with respect to their accuracy and their tendency to overestimate or underestimate adult height.\r"

  ".W": "We report on 21 male patients who presented after 28 days of age with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which we define as late-onset OTC deficiency. These patients appeared normal at birth, but irritability, vomiting, and lethargy, which were often episodic, later developed. The age at presentation ranged from 2 months to 44 years. Biochemical testing revealed hyperammonemia, hyperglutaminemia, hypocitrullinemia, increased urinary orotate excretion, and decreased liver OTC activity measured in vitro, which ranged from 0% to 15% of normal. Male patients who were older at presentation had a somewhat different pattern of presenting symptoms and were more likely to die. These data illustrate the phenotypic variability of OTC deficiency. Unexplained episodes of repetitive or protracted vomiting in association with progressive alterations in behavior or neurologic findings should suggest the diagnosis of a urea cycle defect (or another symptomatic inborn error of metabolism), regardless of the age or medical history of the patient.\r"

Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation.\r"

Both trials were terminated before enrolling their planned sample sizes because of the availability of Exosurf under the provisions of a Treatment Investigational New Drug program. We report the combined results of these trials. Study infants were stratified according to birth weight and gender before random assignment to a treatment regimen. One hundred ninety-two infants received Exosurf and 193 received an air placebo. The study groups were similar when a variety of demographic features describing the mothers, their pregnancies, the circumstances of the births, and the infants were compared. Exosurf-treated infants required significantly less oxygen and respiratory support during the first 3 days of life in comparison with the air-treated infants. Fewer infants in the Exosurf group had pulmonary interstitial emphysema (26 vs 13; p = 0.028). In the Exosurf group, there was a significant reduction in the combined outcome, neonatal death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (57 vs 39; p = 0.042), and there was a significant increase in rates of survival without this disease (128 vs 137; p = 0.042). There were no differences between treatment groups in the incidences of a variety of complications of prematurity, including apnea, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. We conclude that improvements in respiratory physiology after a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf result in an increased likelihood of neonatal survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a \"poor prognosis.\" All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO. The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively. Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged. Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO. Our review demonstrates that ECMO improved survival significantly in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who had a \"poor prognosis\" by the criteria of Bohn et al. We recommend consideration of ECMO for all infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia for whom maximal medical therapy has failed.\r"

Plasma IL-1 beta concentration was undetectable in infants born by normal vaginal delivery or elective cesarean section but was significantly increased in infants born after induced vaginal deliveries (142 +/- 68 pg/ml) or urgent cesarean section (290 +/- 21 pg/ml; both p less than 0.05 compared with normal deliveries). The IL-1 beta levels were elevated in infants with severe perinatal complications (282 +/- 116 pg/ml; p less than 0.001), whereas TNF and IL-6 levels were not related to these complications. Infants with isolated perinatal infectious complications had elevated levels of plasma IL-6 compared with those of sick neonates without infection (p less than 0.001). In contrast, TNF plasma levels and IL-1 beta production by cord blood leukocytes were decreased in infants with infectious complications alone (both p less than 0.05). These studies suggest that the levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF in the cord plasma relate differentially to clinical complications in the perinatal period.\r"

Each study subject received a single intravenous dose of the combined model substrates (0.03 mg/kg lorazepam, 10 mg/kg antipyrine, and 0.5 mg/kg ICG) for 5 minutes, followed by repeated blood sampling (n = 10) during a 24-hour postinfusion period. Patients with CF had a significantly greater plasma clearance of lorazepam (56.5 +/- 5.2 vs 25.9 +/- 1.9 ml/min/m2) and ICG (892.5 +/- 176.4 vs 256.5 +/- 41.7 ml/min/m2) but not of antipyrine (27.2 +/- 3.8 vs 20.7 +/- 2.0 ml/min/m2) in comparison with control subjects. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution for lorazepam, ICG, and antipyrine was significantly higher in the patients with CF (2.0-, 3.1-, and 1.4-fold, respectively) than in control subjects. Clearance of the model substrates did not correlate with standard biochemical markers of hepatic function. Similarly, no significant relationships were observed between the clearance or steady-state volume of distribution of the compounds and the National Institutes of Health prognostic scores for the patients with CF. These data demonstrate that the plasma clearance of lorazepam and ICG is increased in patients with CF and suggest that hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity and biliary secretory capacity are enhanced in this disease.\r"

Psychologic tests were administered both before and after 6 and 12 months of continuous-infusion azidothymidine (AZT; zidovudine) treatment. After 6 months of treatment a significant increase of 15.5 (+/- 3.3) IQ points was demonstrated in general cognitive functioning (p less than 0.001). Follow-up for 10 of these patients indicated that after 12 months of AZT therapy, they had maintained their gains in IQ points. Improvements in adaptive behavior after 6 months of therapy, assessed with a standardized interview, paralleled the findings on the IQ data. No significant differences in the amount of change was observed for the different subgroups. The magnitude of these improvements could not be explained by practice effects, environmental changes, or general improvement in physical state. We conclude that neuropsychologic function was significantly improved with continuous infusion AZT treatment.\r"

This subset of demonstrably incontinent patients was characterized as to symptoms of stress and urge incontinence, incidence of nulliparity, occurrence of incontinence during intercourse and influence of weight on bladder pressure. Using clusters of symptoms did not accurately distinguish GSI from the other types of urinary incontinence. Four percent of the GSI patients were nulliparous. All had a reasonable explanation for incontinence other than anatomic relaxation. Twenty-three percent of the 154 sexually active GSI patients acknowledged having incontinence with intercourse. None of the anatomic and urodynamic parameters evaluated distinguished that group from their GSI counterparts who did not lose urine with intercourse. Increasing weight, expressed as the body mass index, correlated with an increase in the vesical pressure in the supine and standing positions.\r"

Among similar treatment groups no differences were seen regarding the number of emetic events, level of nausea, degree of sedation or overall acceptability of one treatment arm or another. While not superior to prochlorperazine, transdermal scopolamine is a useful antiemetic agent and can be combined with metoclopramide in an attempt to reduce cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. Further evaluation of this approach is needed.\r"

For the last 14 years we have used the CO2 laser for the treatment of VAIN and have treated a total of 143 patients. Our use of a combination of wire sutures through the vaginal mucosa and the introduction of fluids into the underlying submucosal areas allows retraction and ballooning of the recesses and scars and permits us to place the vaginal mucosa at right angles to the laser beam to allow complete treatment.\r"

  ".W": "One of the most severe complications of laparoscopic tubal sterilization is bowel burns, although they often go undetected at the time of laparoscopy. Controversy remains over whether these injuries are caused directly by operator error or indirectly from a hot oviduct's or instrument's inadvertently touching and burning the intestine. A study was performed to determine the potential for direct or indirect bowel burns using bipolar electrocoagulation in rabbits. The results indicate that neither a hot tube nor hot (recently used) forceps could cause injuries to the serosal surface of the intestine. That was true both of immediate injury and after one to five days of recovery. It was observed that the hot uterine tube caused significant bowel adhesions by five days after the procedure. Direct electrocoagulation of the bowel using 40 W for three seconds caused a minor, noticeable blanch on the bowel that was not detectable with gross or histologic means after one day of recovery. A direct bowel injury did result when 80 W was used for three seconds; the bowel became perforated after one day. These findings indicate that it is unlikely that one can produce a bowel burn indirectly from a hot uterine tube or instrument and that only a direct insult to the bowel appears to cause an injury. However, adhesions could be a complication of the procedure and should be considered.\r"

The mean CRP levels did not differ significantly in patients with severe and moderate salpingitis in comparison with mild salpingitis on admission or during treatment, nor was there any significant difference between the mean CRP levels in patients with acute chlamydial/gonococcal and nonchlamydial/nongonococcal PID. The mean CRP levels decreased by the third day of treatment in all treatment groups, and the decrease by the sixth day of treatment was significant (P less than .05), reflecting the clinical response to therapy faster than did serial ESR determinations. After the documentation of acute PID, serial serum CRP determinations were a useful predictor of the short-term response to antimicrobial therapy.\r"

A study was done to define changes in both the adequacy of sampling and the detection rate for both squamous and glandular epithelial abnormalities with the cytobrush. To accomplish this goal, 1,000 cytobrush and 244 conventionally obtained smears were analyzed prospectively, and 3,864 SHS samples obtained in 1986 prior to the change in method were reviewed retrospectively. As compared to cervical samples obtained by conventional methods, the cytobrush smears contained significantly more endocervical cells and had fewer drying artifacts. Both methods obtained equivalent squamous samples and had similar final class distributions. No case of endocervical adenocarcinoma carcinoma in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma was detected. SHS patients who had initial \"no endocervical cells\" samples but whose repeat sample did contain endocervical cells retained the same class in more than 75% of cases. This study confirmed that the cytobrush technique produces Papanicolaou smears with improved sampling of the squamocolumnar junction but questioned whether that results in an increased detection rate for cervical pathology.\r"

  ".W": "In initiating a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) protocol, we relied upon placental locations as the determinant in the choice of technique. An anterior or fundal location prompted a transabdominal (TA) CVS, while the transcervical (TC) approach was reserved for posterior placentas. A coaxial needle system was used for TA CVS (18-gauge, 15-cm guide needle and 20-gauge, 20-cm sampling needle), while TC CVS was accomplished with a 5.8-French, 27-cm polyethylene catheter. Between July 1988 and February 1989 our initial 118 procedures were performed for 115 consecutive pregnancies using this protocol. Testing indications and antenatal characteristics of the TA (n = 56) and TC (n = 63) groups were similar. One procedure failure occurred in the TC group, and a single aspiration was sufficient in 59% of the cases (TA, 30/55; TC, 39/63). In TC procedures an increased aggregate sample weight was observed as compared to TA cases (25.8 g vs. 16.9 g, respectively; P less than .001). This difference was not attributable to an increased number of placental aspirations in TC cases. One abnormal karyotype was observed (45X), and four pregnancy losses occurred (TC, 3; TA, 1). Using placental location to determine the choice of CVS technique appears to be feasible and may be associated with a lower failure rate during a facility's initial experience (when compared to reliance upon one technique alone). Trials comparing the safety of these two methods should consider placental location an independent variable before randomization.\r"

The evaluation included colposcopy, colposcopically directed biopsies, endocervical curettage and repeat Papanicolaou smears. A total of 101 patients were included in the study. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was seen in 29.7% (30 patients): 12.9% (13) CIN I, 12.9% (13) CIN II and 3.9% (4) CIN III. Carcinoma was seen in 3.9% (4) of the patients: 2.9% (3) was carcinoma in situ, and 0.99% (1) was invasive squamous cell carcinoma, stage IIb. HPV and dysplastic lesions were seen together in 19.8% (20) of the patients. HPV was seen alone in 45% (46). Twenty-one patients (20.8%) had no apparent lesions on colposcopy, although one developed microinvasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma within 36 months of colposcopy. Many significant lesions can go undetected for extended periods of time in women with atypical Papanicolaou smears, resulting in delayed management. Referral for immediate colposcopy is advocated strongly.\r"

  ".U": "91061481\r", 
  ".W": "From Jan. 1, 1983, to Jan. 1, 1988, 66 consecutive neonates with coarctation and severe hypoplasia of the transverse arch underwent coarctation repair by resection of the coarctation and reconstruction of the aortic arch. Mean age at operation was 14 +/- 8 days, ranging from 2 to 30 days; 63% of the newborn infants were less than 2 weeks of age. The coarctation was isolated in 23%, associated with a ventricular septal defect in 39%, and associated with complex anomalies in 38%, including 16 cases of transposition of the great arteries or doublet-outlet right ventricle plus ventricular septal defect, two cases of simple transposition, two of corrected transposition plus ventricular septal defect, and five cases of \"hypoplastic\" left ventricle. The surgical technique comprises a wide resection of the coarctation extended to the contiguous ductal tissue followed by the reconstruction of the aortic arch in bringing the descending aorta into the concavity of the aortic arch. This technique is able to relieve the obstruction of the aortic arch provided that (1) the descending aorta is widely dissected to allow mobilization and (2) the incision of the transverse arch is extended proximal to the ostium of the left carotid artery. The operation was performed through a left thoracotomy in 62 patients and through a sternotomy in four additional neonates with transposition and ventricular septal defect who underwent a one-stage repair with aortic reconstruction, closure of the defect, and arterial switch. The overall early mortality rate (less than 30 days) was 14% (9/66; 95% confidence limits = 5% to 22%), including four deaths occurring within the first month, at a concomitant or subsequent repair of the associated anomaly. There were six late deaths, all related to the associated lesions. The overall mortality rate was 23% (15/66; 95% confidence limits = 13% to 33%). The mean follow-up was 21 +/- 10 months, ranging from 6 to 66 months. Actuarial survival rates at 5 years are 72% +/- 10% for the overall group; 87% +/- 17% for simple coarctation; 88% +/- 12% for coarctation and ventricular septal defect; and 52% +/- 18% for complex coarctation. The rate of recurrent coarctation was 12.5% (95% confidence limits = 2% to 23%), leading to five reoperations with no deaths. Freedom from reoperation was 89.5% +/- 9% at 5 years. This technique of coarctation repair offers several advantages: low operative mortality, complete relief of the left ventricular obstruction, wide resection of the ductus tissue, absence of prosthetic material, and preservation of the left subclavian artery.\r"

  ".W": "The reported relatively high incidence of early restenosis at the coarctation repair site with subclavian flap angioplasty, especially in infants less than 3 months of age, prompted a physiologically oriented analysis of relief of obstruction from coarctation after subclavian flap angioplasty versus resection and end-to-end anastomosis in infancy. Twenty-one patients who had undergone repair of coarctation in infancy by either subclavian flap angioplasty (nine patients) (median age 8 years) or resection and end-to-end anastomosis (12 patients) (median age 8 years) were evaluated by Doppler spectrum analysis of the blood flow velocities in the femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia. The median resting right upper to lower limb systolic pressure difference (with interquartile range) was similar in the angioplasty, resection and anastomosis, and control groups: -5 mm Hg (18 mm Hg), 0 mm Hg (12 mm Hg), and -2.5 mm Hg (10 mm Hg), respectively. Also, similar resting values for the maximum frequency of the advancing curve and the pulsatility and resistance indices were measured in the three groups. During reactive hyperemia of the leg, however, a significant hemodynamic obstruction across the repair site became clinically manifest in the angioplasty group only, as documented by a lower pulsatility index in comparison with the control group (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). Comparison of the hemodynamic results between the angioplasty and resection and anastomosis groups in subdivisions of infants operated on at an age of less or greater than 3 months, both at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed, already at rest, a significantly lower value for the pulsatility index in the former angioplasty subdivision (p = 0.05, Student's t test), indicating a significant resistance at the coarctation repair site in the angioplasty patients operated on before the third month of life. A disadvantage of angioplasty (compared with resection and anastomosis) was noted when angioplasty was performed before the third month of life, and an unequivocal lack of advantage was noted when performed beyond that period regarding relief of obstruction from coarctation. In addition, a definite potential for adverse long-term effects on the hemodynamics of the left upper limb after subclavian flap angioplasty in infancy has been documented. For these reasons we prefer to perform resection and end-to-end anastomosis for repair of coarctation in infancy.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of controlled vasodilation on blood flow and oxygen consumption above and below the aortic occlusion during crossclamping of the thoracic aorta were examined in 16 mongrel dogs anesthetized with halothane. Blood flow in the inferior vena cava was measured with an electromagnetic cannulating flow probe, and cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. The animals were divided into two groups. In the control group the thoracic aorta was crossclamped at the diaphragmatic level for 30 minutes. In the sodium nitroprusside group the aorta was also crossclamped for 30 minutes, but an infusion of sodium nitroprusside was initiated after 10 minutes of occlusion to decrease systemic blood pressure. Measurements were made before and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after aortic crossclamping, and at 10 minutes after aortic unclamping. Crossclamping of the thoracic aorta was associated with marked decreases in blood flow and oxygen consumption in organs and tissues below the aortic occlusion in both groups. Above the occlusion, blood flow increased but oxygen uptake decreased. Sodium nitroprusside increased cardiac output and blood flow above the aortic occlusion even more than crossclamping alone while it decreased blood flow and oxygen consumption below the crossclamp.\r"

  ".W": "A national survey of the patterns of care for carcinoma of the lung sponsored by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons has documented continuing changes in epidemiology, treatment, and outcome. The project consisted of a long-term study of 15,219 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1981 and a short-term study of 19,074 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1986. The male/female incidence ratios have continued to decrease and the decrease has moved into the older age groups. Although the percentage of adenocarcinoma is increasing at the expense of squamous carcinoma, the latter is still the most prevalent histologic type. The accuracy of percutaneous needle biopsy and transbronchial biopsy of lung nodules reported from this group of 941 hospitals was high and equal to that reported by single institutions. The percentage of patients having a resection did not increase from 1981 to 1986, but for smaller lesions a move was apparent toward more lung-sparing resections. Little change has occurred in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, particularly in stage III disease, where approximately 50% of the patients received postoperative irradiation. An improvement in the overall 5-year survival when compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data was noted. Whether this is a true improvement in survival or is the result of selection because of an unrecognized change in the pattern of care for patients with a carcinoma of the lung is unknown.\r"

Grossly, two tumors had predominantly endobronchial growths, four bulky parenchymal growths, and two endobronchial, parenchymally mixed growths. In these eight patients, six tumors were completely resected, one patient was given irradiation only, and one patient died in the early postoperative period. On the basis of specific differentiation of the sarcoma-like lesions, the tumors were separated into three groups: two with \"true\" sarcoma differentiated into soft tissues such as striated muscle or osteoid tissue; three with a fibromatous sarcoma resembling atypical pseudosarcomatous stroma; and three with spindle cell carcinoma with evidence of epithelial differentiation. The prognosis was poor, and tumors with specific differentiation into rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, or spindle cell carcinoma progressed more rapidly than did those with a fibromatous sarcoma. Because the fibromatous sarcoma-like lesions were found to relate to a longer survival time for the patients, we wish to emphasize that a distinction of sarcomatous components should be made with regard to assessing the prognosis of pulmonary carcinoma with sarcoma-like lesions.\r"

  ".U": "91061486\r", 
  ".W": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of the utility of frozen-section diagnoses in determining lymph node status at mediastinoscopy in 122 consecutive patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. Thirty-five of 122 patients had one or more lymph nodes with frozen-section evaluation positive for metastatic carcinoma. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-section study revealed metastatic carcinoma in two additional patients. The false-negative rate was 1.6%. Sensitivity was 94.6%. Predictive value of negative frozen-section evaluation results was 97.7%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section evaluation were 100%. The statuses of individual lymph nodes from these 122 patients were also evaluated. Six hundred twenty lymph nodes were sampled from the mediastinum at mediastinoscopy. Frozen-sections in 47 lymph nodes were positive. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-sections examination revealed metastatic carcinoma in four additional lymph nodes. The false-negative rate was 0.6%. Sensitivity was 92.2%. Predictive value of negative results from frozen-section evaluation was 99.3%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section examination were 100%. We conclude that frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes at mediastinoscopy reliably indicates lymph node status, thus enabling the physician to decide whether to proceed to thoracotomy. Thus staging of the carcinoma and definitive surgery can be accomplished during a single anesthetic procedure. Combining mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy with frozen-section diagnostic control also reduces both the length and cost of hospitalization.\r"

  ".W": "The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas.\r"

Fine needle aspiration in the second case showed lymphoma, and further chemotherapy was instituted; however, persistent growth of the nodule prompted a resection. Microscopic examination of the resected tumors in both cases revealed histologic features of high-grade osteosarcoma. Flow cytometric analyses of the primary tumors showed abnormal hyperdiploid deoxyribonucleic acid populations in accordance with those seen in high-grade malignant neoplasms. Immunohistochemical studies supported a mesenchymal origin for these tumors. These tumors shared clinical features with other reported cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung such as large size at diagnosis, occurrence in older individuals, and aggressive behavior.\r"

  ".W": "This study compares the metabolism and functional responses of adult and immature hearts to a standard ischemic insult. Ten adult dogs (25 to 27 kg) and 10 puppies (6 to 10 weeks old) underwent 45 minutes of aortic clamping on bypass. Preoperative and postoperative ventricular performance (Starling curves), biochemical factors, and water content were measured. Global ischemia in adults produced a 30% mortality rate (3/10) and low output syndrome in survivors (33% recovery of stroke work index). Conversely, all puppies survived and stroke work index returned to 85% of control, with less edema developing (0.4% versus 2% water gain, p less than 0.05). Puppies expended comparable glycogen stores but used more glutamate (15.4 versus 8.6 mumol/gm dry weight), produced more alanine (18.9 versus 6.4 mumol, p less than 0.05), succinate (19 versus 8.2 mumol, p less than 0.05), and malate (2.6 versus 0.15 mumol, p less than 0.05) during ischemia, and recovered better postischemic aerobic metabolism (410 versus 255 nmol tissue pyruvate, p less than 0.05). We conclude that tolerance of immature hearts to ischemia is related to amino acid utilization by transamination and increased substrate level phosphorylation, as occurring in diving mammals, suggesting retention of intrautero adaptive mechanisms.\r"

Amino acid transamination was inhibited metabolically by pretreatment with aminooxyacetic acid. The aminooxyacetic acid dose and duration were determined by incubating in vitro tissue homogenate and showing that an 8 mmol/L AOA dose for 5 minutes blocked 90% of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity. Control studies in nonischemic hearts showed that coronary perfusion with aminooxyacetic acid for 5 minutes did not impair myocardial performance. In contrast, pretreatment of immature puppies with aminooxyacetic acid severely impaired recovery after 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia (30% versus 85% recovery in untreated hearts, p less than 0.05). Biochemical analyses of hearts undergoing ischemia showed aminooxyacetic acid to limit lactate production, impair glutamate utilization, prevent alanine production, and limit succinate accumulation (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that amino acid transamination is an important adaptive process in the immature heart that improves its resistance to ischemic damage.\r"

  ".U": "91061492\r", 
  ".W": "The use of profound hypothermia and total circulatory arrest for repair of heart defects in neonates usually involves a period of systemic and myocardial bypass cooling. Rapid cooling of muscle (skeletal, smooth, and myocardial) can result in contracture through elevation of cytosolic calcium levels. The increased myocardial tone caused by cooling might render the heart more vulnerable to a subsequent period of cardioplegic ischemic arrest. Infants may be more susceptible to contracture because their small body mass allows more rapid myocardial temperature change when prearrest bypass cooling is used. The influence of avoiding rapid myocardial cooling before induced cardioplegic arrest was analyzed in a group of infants weighing less than 6 kg at the time of open cardiac operation. Myocardial ischemic arrest by warm (37 degrees C) induction blood cardioplegia was used in 57 infants and compared with results in 440 infants treated with standard blood cardioplegia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patient diagnosis, weight, and age at operation were significant risk factors for operative mortality. The use of warm induction blood cardioplegia had a strongly positive independent effect on survival (p = 0.0003) for any patient weight, age, or diagnostic group. We recommend the avoidance of rapid myocardial cooling on bypass in all patients before induction of cardioplegic ischemic arrest.\r"

Control hearts were preserved with hypothermia alone, and groups 1 to 6 were given different hyperkalemic crystalloid cardioplegic solutions. Each cardioplegic solution differed in Na+ and Ca++ content. Aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, heart rate, peak systolic pressure, and stroke work were measured before ischemia and after 35 and 45 minutes of reperfusion. There were no statistical differences in hemodynamic recovery in the six groups in which cardioplegia was used. However, hearts preserved with multidose hyperkalemic cardioplegia showed significantly better recovery of cardiac output (86% versus 75%; p less than 0.05), coronary flow (88% versus 72%; p less than 0.05), and stroke work (86% versus 75%; p less than 0.05) than those preserved with hypothermia alone. These results suggest that hypothermic hyperkalemic cardioplegia improves preservation of the neonatal rabbit heart but that variations in Ca++ and Na+ content appear not to provide further myocardial protection.\r"

  ".W": "We performed long-term closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass in an animal model of total heart failure (induced ventricular fibrillation). The extracorporeal system included a venous reservoir, a roller pump, a membrane lung, and a blood pulsator system. We cannulated the right external jugular vein for venous drainage and the right subclavian artery for arterial return. To decompress the left heart we passed by percutaneous cannulation a special helical spring mounted on a Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Edwards Divisions, Irvine, Calif.) and positioned it to rest within the pulmonary artery and tricuspid valves, which rendered them partly incompetent. After induced ventricular fibrillation, blood flow was raised to keep the central venous pressure at baseline values. The lungs were ventilated with 5% carbon dioxide in room air. During bypass, mean pulmonary artery pressure was 10.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, mean wedge pressure 11.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, and mean blood pressure 95.2 +/- 5.6 mm Hg. After 2 days (four animals) and 3 days (two animals) the hearts were defibrillated. There was immediate ejection from both sides of the heart. All sheep were weaned from bypass within 29 +/- 11 minutes and their lungs were ventilated with room air within 42 +/- 34 minutes. At autopsy hearts and lungs grossly appeared normal. We conclude that the percutaneous helical spring resting within right heart valves provided excellent decompression throughout the study, with full recovery of heart and lung function on defibrillation.\r"

In a randomized study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking drug sotalol versus propranolol at low and high doses in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 429 consecutive patients after coronary artery bypass graft operations. Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function and other contraindications for beta-blockers were excluded. From the fourth hour up to the sixth day after coronary artery bypass, 74 patients received low-dose sotalol (40 mg every 8 hours), 66 patients low-dose propranolol (10 mg every 6 hours), 133 patients high-dose sotalol (80 mg every 8 hours), and 156 patients high-dose propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours). Baseline characteristics were comparable in all groups. Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 10 of 72 (13.9%) who received low-dose sotalol, 12 of 64 (18.8%) who received low-dose propranolol, 13 of 119 (10.9%) who received high-dose sotalol, and 19 of 139 (13.7%) who received high-dose propranolol (not significant). Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug occurred in four receiving low doses (2.9%) and in 31 receiving high doses (10.7%) (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, no medication was found to be superior, although supraventricular tachyarrhythmias tended to be less prevalent in patients treated with sotalol than in those treated with propranolol. Moreover, significantly fewer adverse effects were noted in both low-dose groups. Therefore, low-dose beta-blocking treatment, especially low-dose sotalol, seems preferable.\r"

New strategies to identify core-group members aside from the currently used STD-repeater status would be of immense help in targeting educational efforts, laboratory screening, and vaccines. Achieving more complete control of STDs may be possible if recent advances in our understanding of their epidemiology and transmission dynamics can be translated into effective new interventional strategies.\r"

  ".W": "Chlamydia trachomatis is a unique intracellular parasite that causes a number of common sexually transmitted disease syndromes, including nongonococcal urethritis in both men and women, epididymitis in men, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Infants exposed at delivery are at risk for the development of conjunctivitis and pneumonia. There is strong evidence that Chlamydia is a cause of obstructive infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women. It appears that these complications result from the chronic inflammatory response and secondary scarring that are elicited by long-term asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic fallopian tube infections. Because treatment with tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin is simple, effective, and inexpensive, major efforts should be put into identifying asymptomatic young women through screening of the subpopulations at highest risk. These include sexually active adolescent women and older women who are not monogamous. Blacks are at higher risk than other ethnic groups for infection. The cost of diagnosing chlamydial infection has decreased with the introduction of new nonculture diagnostic tests. This should increase the availability of testing for screening purposes. It is critical to remember that male sex partners of infected women must be treated; otherwise all efforts to prevent long-term complications by identifying and treating asymptomatic women are doomed to failure.\r"

  ".W": "There has been a dramatic increase in patient visits to physicians for evaluation and treatment of genital herpes infections. This has resulted in part from an increase in genital herpes infections, particularly severe, first-episode genital herpes infections in adults without prior HSV-1 infection. Virus culture remains the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosis, and use of viral cultures is encouraged. Type-specific antibody tests have been employed in studies documenting the role of asymptomatic shedding of HSV in transmission of genital infections, the role of genital HSV in transmission of HIV, the predominance of asymptomatic and unrecognized infections in those infected with HSV-2, and the presence of past asymptomatic or unrecognized acquisition of HSV-2 in 25% of persons presenting with first-episode genital herpes. Unfortunately, commercially available serologic tests do not reliably differentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. Recent studies suggest that the annual risk of transmission from a sexual partner with genital herpes is about 10% in heterosexual couples. Currently, promotion of \"safe sex\" is the only available approach for prevention of transmission. However, ongoing research is focused on the development of an effective vaccine. Acyclovir should be used routinely in persons with first-episode genital herpes, but careful evaluation is needed in persons with recurrent genital herpes to determine whether episodic or suppressive treatment is indicated. Acyclovir should also be used routinely for episodic or suppressive treatment of HSV infections in persons with AIDS. Additional antiviral agents are needed for more effective suppressive therapy and for treatment of ACV-resistant HSV infections in the immunocompromised host.\r"

The association of HPV infection with genital tract malignancies is of great concern, and further studies are needed to clarify this association. Few investigators believe at this time that proof of a direct causative role exists for HPV in these cancers, but indirect evidence of such a role is abundant. There are many clinical forms of HPV infection of the genital tract, and few clinicians can easily recognize them all. Treatment of condyloma acuminatum is difficult and frustrating. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the safest and most effective therapy for most forms of condyloma acuminatum. Recurrence of condyloma acuminatum is common with all presently used forms of therapy, probably owing to latent HPV infection in normal-appearing skin. No form of treatment is ideal for all forms of condyloma acuminatum, but without continued efforts to find better therapeutic modalities and preventative measures, the epidemic of genital HPV infection will continue unchecked.\r"

  ".W": "Although molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and infestation by crab lice do not carry the requirements of partner notification or other long-term consequences, they are among the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease. Molluscum contagiosum is a benign viral infection of the skin epidermal layer, most often transmitted by intimate skin-to-skin contact. The lesions often resolve spontaneously over time, but patient discomfort or social reasons may require destructive removal of the lesions. Scabies is caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. The victims continually itch, especially at night, and often seek over-the-counter topical remedies before seeing a clinician. Once a correct diagnosis is made, successful resolution of this disease and its itching can be achieved. Head and pubic lice account for most of the more than three million cases of louse infestation treated in the United States each year. Symptoms of infestation generally include itching that leads to scratching, erythema, irritation, and inflammation. A careful diagnosis followed by disinfection, symptomatic treatment, and psychologic support should result in a complete cure with no long-term effects.\r"

  ".W": "The most important causes of urethritis, and epididymitis in younger men, are C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae. Management of these syndromes requires a thorough sexual history, genital examination, evaluation for objective and laboratory evidence of infection, antimicrobial therapy directed toward the major etiologies, and evaluation and treatment of sexual partners. Treatment of N. gonorrhoeae requires use of a single-dose regimen active against this organism, plus a 7- to 10-day tetracycline regime active against C. trachomatis and nongonococcal urethritis. With recommended regimens, microbiologic failure is infrequent in compliant patients. Recurrent urethritis is frequent, however. The management of patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms requires careful reevaluation of the patient, documentation of urethritis, and re-treatment with antimicrobials if urethritis is documented by positive cultures or increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in urethral secretions. Additional treatment beyond this point usually is not indicated, even though a proportion of men will remain symptomatic and some of these will have increased numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in urethral secretions. The most important causes of prostatitis, and epididymitis in older men or men with urethral structural abnormalities, are classical urinary tract pathogens rather than sexually transmitted pathogens. Management of these infections includes documentation of the infection and treatment directed toward the specific pathogen. Men with symptoms of \"prostatitis\" must be evaluated using both urine and prostatic secretions to document infection and inflammation. The majority of men with such symptoms do not have an infection that can be documented. These men respond poorly to medications. Men with documented chronic bacterial prostatitis require long courses of antimicrobials to effect cure. In some cases, however, the disease is intractable, and chronic suppression with antimicrobials may be necessary.\r"

One fourth to one half of patients with genital ulcers have no diagnosed cause for their illness despite diagnostic efforts. The bulk of these cases is probably constituted by one of the three diseases for which diagnostic tests are falsely negative. There is accumulating evidence that genital ulcers facilitate the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and they may also be markers of high-risk behavior for acquisition of HIV. Appropriate therapy of patients with genital ulcers (as well as their sexual partners) depends on accurate diagnosis. Patients with genital ulcers, particularly those with syphilis or chancroid, should be encouraged to undergo testing for HIV infection.\r"

Considerable progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of the three common vaginitides. Although excellent progress has been made by the pharmaceutical industry in providing new drugs for vaginitis, any further progress will require a better understanding of etiology and pathogenesis. Vaginitis causes major symptoms and is more than a nuisance problem. Clinicians owe it to their patients to attempt to make an accurate diagnosis and not to rely on empiric therapy.\r"

Although laparoscopy is helpful for establishing the diagnosis of salpingitis, other less invasive tests along with selected clinical criteria may also be useful. Treatment of PID, which is empiric and broad spectrum, is oriented toward polymicrobial PID. Whenever possible, women with PID should be hospitalized for parenteral therapy. The 1989 CDC STD treatment guidelines recommend two regimens for inpatient parenteral therapy: clindamycin/gentamicin and cefoxitin, or equivalent cephalosporin/doxycycline. Outpatient management of PID should be monitored closely; the CDC-recommended regimen includes use of intramuscular cephalosporins and oral doxycycline. Oral penicillins are no longer recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Sexually transmitted infections may provoke a wide variety of rheumatic lesions. Disseminated N. gonorrhoeae infection leads to septic arthritis, which may be rapidly destructive but which responds promptly to appropriate antibiotic therapy. In contrast, both gonococcal and nongonococcal infections may lead to aseptic \"reactive\" arthritis or Reiter's syndrome. Inheritance of HLA B27 confers a relative risk of 30 to 50 times for the development of this condition. The demonstration of C. trachomatis antigen in joint material from a minority of patients suggests that direct interaction between microbial components and class I HLA antigens in the joint may be central to the pathogenesis of this disease. Arthralgia and arthritis occur in up to 50% of individuals in the prodrome of hepatitis B infection. Joint symptoms may be accompanied by urticarial or cutaneous vasculitic lesions, especially on the legs; both features resolve with the onset of jaundice. Hepatitis B infection is also a major cause of necrotizing vasculitis, which may or may not be associated with overt hepatitis. Seronegative arthritis, including Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis, a Sjogren's-like syndrome, vasculitis, and myopathies have been described in association with HIV infection. It is clear that synovitis occurs in those patients despite the fact that HIV is present in immune cells within the joint during inflammatory arthritis and that both antigen presentation and lymphocyte responsiveness within the joint are impaired. Nevertheless, synovitis may occur in the presence of marked CD4-positive lymphocyte depletion. Rheumatic syndromes, including arthralgia, inflammatory arthritis, and neuropathic arthritis, may occur during any stage of congenital or acquired syphilis. Syphilitic synovitis responds well to antibiotic therapy, but neuropathic lesions cannot be treated effectively. Septic arthritis has rarely been described as a complication of disseminated Mycoplasma or Urea-plasma infections, and joint lesions sometimes associated with erythema nodosum have also been reported in lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale.\r"

In contrast, heterosexual transmission of HIV is increasing and is disproportionately occurring in inner city racial minorities in association with drug use, populations that are currently experiencing epidemics of previously controlled STDs. Sexually transmitted diseases, especially genital ulcerative diseases and perhaps C. trachomatis and T. vaginalis, facilitate sexual transmission of HIV. In addition, HIV infection itself appears to increase the severity of certain STDs once they are acquired. The control of STDs, particularly in those populations that are at high risk for HIV infection, should be of high priority and should be an integral component of AIDS control programs.\r"

The subjects inhaled fenoterol or placebo by a dry powder delivery system for 24 weeks. Control of asthma was judged by daily morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom diaries, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and requirement for short courses of prednisone. Of 64 subjects who completed the trial, 57 showed a clear difference in degree of control of asthma between the fenoterol and placebo periods: in 17 (30% [95% confidence interval 18.4-43.4%]) asthma was better controlled during regular inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas in 40 (70% [56.6-81.6%]) control was better during placebo treatment with bronchodilator for symptom relief only. Mean airway responsiveness to methacholine increased slightly during the fenoterol period. The adverse effect of regular bronchodilator inhalation occurred not only among subjects who used a bronchodilator as sole treatment (2 were better and 10 were worse during regular bronchodilator treatment) but also among those who took inhaled corticosteroids (14 were better and 29 were worse). Thus, regular inhalation of a beta-sympathomimetic agent was associated with deterioration of asthma control in the majority of subjects. The trends to use of regular, higher doses or longer-acting inhaled beta-sympathomimetic treatment may be an important causal factor in the worldwide increase in morbidity from asthma.\r"

In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the subjects received 2, 6, and 18 puffs of each drug with intervals of 90 min, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, heart rate, QTc interval, plasma potassium concentration, tremor, and bronchial reactivity to histamine were measured. All three drugs produced similar bronchodilatation. However, the rises in heart rate, QTc interval, and tremor and the fall in plasma potassium were greater after fenoterol than after salbutamol or terbutaline. The maximum mean (SD) increases in heart rate for fenoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline were 29 (24) bpm, 8 (9) bpm, and 8 (14) bpm, respectively; falls in plasma potassium were 0.76 (0.62) mmol/l, 0.46 (0.32) mmol/l, and 0.52 (0.39) mmol/l, respectively. Fenoterol afforded no additional protection against histamine compared with salbutamol. These findings suggest that at doses based on those used in clinical practice fenoterol causes more adverse effects than salbutamol or terbutaline. The most likely explanation for these effects is that fenoterol has been marketed at a higher dose than the other beta 2-agonists; fenoterol may in addition be less selective for beta 2 receptors.\r"

The two regimens were equally effective for treatment of erythema migrans. Mild fatigue or arthralgia were the only post-treatment complaints, which resolved within 6 months. None of the patients needed further antibiotic treatment for Lyme borreliosis.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomised, double-blind trial 20 patients with leukaemia received human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 20 received placebo, for 14 days after allogeneic, matched sibling, bone-marrow transplantation. The neutrophil count recovered to 0.5 x 10(9)/l 3 days earlier in the GM-CSF group than in the placebo group (not significant), and the median neutrophil count at 14 days was significantly higher in the GM-CSF group (1.90 vs 0.46 x 10(9)/l). The lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the GM-CSF than in the placebo group between days 10 and 15 after transplantation, but this difference was not associated with a higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease. There was no evidence that GM-CSF was associated with a greater incidence of leukaemic relapse. The GM-CSF group had lower haemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts and higher plasma urea, creatinine, and bilirubin than the placebo group. The duration of hospital stay was the same for both patient groups. Further studies are now indicated to assess the overall effect of GM-CSF on outcome after allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation.\r"

The transthoracic echocardiographic examination was normal in 92 patients (60%), whereas only 65 patients (42%) had normal findings after both transthoracic and transoesophageal examination (p less than 0.005). Intracardiac masses, including valvular vegetations, were found in 39 patients (25%), including 27% of patients with cerebral embolism and 32% of these with peripheral embolism, but in none of the patients with retinal ischaemia (p less than 0.001). 47 patients (31%) had valvular disease, 10 (7%) had wall motion abnormalities, 23 (15%) had abnormalities of the interatrial septum, and 9 patients (6%) had diseases of the thoracic aorta. Cardiovascular abnormalities were frequently found by echocardiography in patients with arterial emboli. The transesophageal technique significantly increased the chance of detecting such abnormalities, especially intracardiac masses.\r"

There were strong associations between campylobacter infection and doorstep delivery of milk bottles, a history of milk bottle attack by birds, milk bottle attack by birds during the week before illness, and consumption of milk from attacked bottles during the week before illness. There was a very strong dose-response relation between frequency of bird attack and illness. Controls with a history of milk bottle attack by birds were more likely than cases to have taken preventive measures against bird attack and consumption of contaminated milk. Although few people witnessed the attacks, the likely culprits are magpies (Pica pica) and jackdaws (Corvus monedula).\r"
