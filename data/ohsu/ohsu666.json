  ".W": "The class II (Ia) major histocompatibility complex antigens are a family of integral membrane proteins whose expression is limited to certain cell types, predominantly B lymphocytes, macrophages, and thymic epithelial cells. In B cells, Ia expression is both developmentally regulated and responsive to external stimuli. The differentiation of early B stem cells to mature B lymphocytes is accompanied by the appearance of cell surface Ia antigens; the transition to plasma cells results in loss of class II gene expression. In Ia-expressing B cells, the T cell-derived lymphokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) increases such expression by an as yet undefined mechanism. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression was cis-activated by a region of the Ia A alpha k gene in a B lymphoma line, but not in a myeloma line. A nuclear protein that bound to two sites within this region, upstream from previously described transcription elements, was found in normal spleen cells. This binding activity was also found in spleen extracts from athymic mice, which lack T lymphocytes, and in Ia-positive B lymphocyte tumor cell lines, demonstrating that it is a B cell protein. Further analysis showed the activity to be undetectable in an Ia-negative pre-B cell line and in three plasmacytoma cell lines that are Ia negative. IL-4 treatment of normal and athymic mouse spleen cells greatly increased the binding of this nuclear protein to these two sites, concomitant with increased MHC class II gene transcription. Thus, B cells contain a sequence-specific DNA-binding activity whose level is influenced both by IL-4 and by differentiation signals.\r"

The elav locus is one of the first examples of a gene that is expressed in neurons early during this developmental sequence. This gene has been shown to be required for the proper development of young neurons and for the maintenance of mature neurons. DNA sequence data presented in this report suggest that the elav gene product is an RNA binding protein, based on the presence of RNP (ribonucleoprotein) consensus sequences. This leads to the proposal that this protein is involved in the RNA metabolism of neurons.\r"

The alpha 1AT-synthesizing cells of individuals with the Z gene have normal alpha 1AT messenger RNA levels, but alpha 1AT secretion is markedly reduced secondary to accumulation of newly synthesized alpha 1AT in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Crystallographic analysis of alpha 1AT predicts that in normal alpha 1AT, a negatively charged Glu342 is adjacent to positively charged Lys290. Thus the Glu342----Lys342 Z mutation caused the loss of a normal salt bridge, resulting in the intracellular aggregation of the Z molecule. The prediction was made that a second mutation in the alpha 1AT genet that changed the positively charged Lys290 to a negatively charged Glu290 would correct the secretion defect. When the second mutation was added to the Z-type complementary DNA, the resulting gene directed the synthesis and secretion of amounts of alpha 1AT similar to that directed by the normal alpha 1AT complementary DNA in an in vitro eukaryotic expression system. This suggests the possibility that a human hereditary disease can be corrected by inserting an additional mutation in the same gene.\r"

The study was performed before and after long-term therapy with diet and glibenclamide. After treatment, the antilipolytic potency of insulin in fat cells was threefold enhanced (p less than 0.05) in the fasting state and remained unaltered after glucose ingestion. In untreated NIDDM oral glucose induced a significant (p less than 0.01) increase in insulin sensitivity. In consequence, in the glucose-fed state insulin sensitivity was similar before and after therapy. Adipocyte insulin receptor binding was comparable before and after therapy, both in the fasting state and following glucose intake. In untreated NIDDM, despite relative hypoinsulinemia, plasma glycerol was markedly reduced after oral glucose. After therapy, plasma glycerol was significantly reduced both in the fasting state and following glucose ingestion. At the same time, fasting and glucose-stimulated circulating insulin were significantly (p less than 0.01) increased. It is concluded that conventional antidiabetes therapy in NIDDM mediates a suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis. This seems to be due to an improvement in insulin secretion in combination with a potentiation of the antilipolytic effectiveness of insulin in fat cells in the fasting state, the latter being secondary to post-binding alterations in insulin action.\r"

Electrophysiologic studies were performed before and during drug treatment. Encainide resulted in anterograde accessory pathway block in 15 of 37 (41%) and retrograde accessory pathway block in 11 of 46 (24%) patients. In patients with residual accessory pathway conduction, encainide significantly prolonged the shortest pacing cycle length maintaining anterograde (261 +/- 26 to 404 +/- 85 ms) and retrograde (279 +/- 46 to 436 +/- 87 ms) accessory pathway conduction, as well as the anterograde accessory pathway effective refractory period (271 +/- 32 to 329 +/- 73 ms). AVRT could not be induced during encainide therapy in 20 of 49 patients (41%). In the remaining patients, AVRT cycle length increased (319 +/- 44 to 426 +/- 90 ms, p less than 0.001) due to prolongation of HV and ventriculoatrial intervals. During follow-up (mean 38.5 months), 30 patients continued to take the drug and 7 patients with favorable drug response subsequently elected to undergo surgical accessory pathway ablation (71% overall favorable response). Encainide was ineffective in 11 patients, was discontinued because of drug intolerance in 2 patients and exacerbated ventricular tachycardia in 2 patients. Lack of AVRT inducibility at encainide electrophysiologic study did not always predict recurrence-free follow-up. Encainide is an effective and well-tolerated drug to prevent recurrence of AVRT in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

The mean age was 38 +/- 15 years, with structural heart disease present in only 3 patients. Nine patients had only paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 27 patients had both atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Symptoms were present for a mean of 195 +/- 168 months and were treated with an average of 2.7 +/- 1.6 drugs before encainide. Anterograde block in the accessory pathway occurred in 12 of 30 patients (40%) and retrograde block accessory pathway occurred in 10 of 24 patients in whom comparison could be made. AVRT was initiated in 29 of 36 patients during the control study and could be initiated in 19 of 29 patients while receiving encainide. Drug efficacy was determined by the clinical response judged completely effective, partially effective or ineffective. During a mean follow-up of 30.1 +/- 25 months, 24 patients (67%) continued to take encainide. Encainide was completely effective in 14 of 24 patients and partially effective in another 7 patients. Noncardiac side effects were mild and generally resolved, and required discontinuance in only 1 patient. More frequent AVRT occurred in 2 patients, but was managed with dose reduction and the addition of a beta blocker. Three patients had ventricular tachycardia requiring discontinuance; however 2 of 3 patients had a history of ventricular tachycardia before receiving encainide. Encainide is an effective and safe agent for treating atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.\r"

Encainide prolonged the minimum atrial pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction from 334 +/- 55 to 391 +/- 55 ms (p = 0.0001).

After encainide, AVNRT was not inducible in 32 of 47 patients (68%) primarily because of the effects on retrograde AV nodal conduction. In the remaining 15 (32%) patients, AVNRT remained inducible; however, the tachycardia cycle length slowed from 397 +/- 86 to 492 +/- 90 ms (p = 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the baseline minimum ventricular pacing cycle length maintaining 1:1 VA conduction in patients whose inducible tachycardia was or was not suppressed. Forty-seven patients were treated for 18.9 +/- 12.9 months (range 1 to 50) with oral encainide. Encainide was completely effective in eliminating recurrences of supraventricular tachycardia in 26 of 47 patients (55%) and partially effective in an additional 42%. Recurrences of arrhythmia occurred in 15 of 32 patients (47%) whose inducible tachycardia was suppressed by encainide and 7 of 15 patients (47%) whose inducible tachycardia was not suppressed by encainide (p = not significant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "For treatment of chronic atrial and junctional ectopic tachycardia, standard antiarrhythmic therapy has been shown to be ineffective in most patients. Both the intravenous efficacy and the oral efficacy of 2 class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, encainide and flecainide, were studied in 16 patients with atrial ectopic tachycardia and in 3 patients with junctional ectopic tachycardia, using exercise testing, 24-hour long-term electrocardiography and programmed electrical stimulation. All patients had been previously treated unsuccessfully with several antiarrhythmic drugs. In 5 patients, tachycardia was persistent; in the remaining patients, it occurred intermittently for more than 12 hours/day. Intravenous encainide, in doses ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 mg/kg body weight, was given to 5 patients with atrial ectopic tachycardia, and it terminated atrial ectopic tachycardia in all patients. Intravenous flecainide was given to 9 patients, and it terminated atrial tachycardia in 4 and slowed the tachycardia rate in 2. It terminated junctional tachycardia in 2 patients and slowed tachycardia rate in 1. During a follow-up period of 10 +/- 5 months, oral encainide, in dosages between 150 and 225 mg/day, completely suppressed atrial ectopic activity in 4 patients. In the remaining patient, encainide reduced the number of tachycardia episodes markedly but had to be withdrawn because of intolerable side effects. During a 12 +/- 11-month (median 6) follow-up, oral flecainide at dosages between 200 and 300 mg/day, completely suppressed ectopic activity in 7 patients and improved symptoms in 5. Only 1 patient failed to respond to oral flecainide. The results of this study indicate that both encainide and flecainide are effective in the treatment of chronic ectopic atrial and junctional tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "Reversal of the electrophysiologic effects of oral encainide with isoproterenol was evaluated in 16 patients with atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry (group A) and in another 16 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (group B). Sustained AV nodal reentry was induced in all group A cases before administration of encainide, in 2 cases after oral encainide, and in 12 patients during infusion of isoproterenol. Among group B cases, 14 of 16 had sustained AV reentry during control, 6 of 16 after receiving encainide, and 8 of 16 with addition of isoproterenol. During a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 10 months in group A and 17 +/- 9 months in group B, clinical tachycardia recurred in 8 patients (4 from each group). These 8 patients were among the 20 patients who demonstrated (1) isoproterenol-induced reversibility of encainide-suppressed tachycardia, or (2) acceleration of tachycardia rate slowed by encainide. No recurrences were seen among any of the 12 cases in which isoproterenol failed to reverse the encainide-induced tachycardia suppression. Patients with clinical recurrences were controlled with a variety of means, which included beta blockers in 3 and nonpharmacologic methods in the remaining 5. In patients with AV junctional tachycardia treated with oral encainide, our findings suggest that lack of tachycardia inducibility with isoproterenol predicts freedom from clinical recurrences. Furthermore, addition of a beta blocker to oral encainide may prevent clinical recurrence in some who demonstrate adrenergic reversal of encainide effect.\r"

  ".U": "89074556\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-one children (26 weeks gestational age to 20 years) with drug-resistant supraventricular tachycardia were treated with oral encainide, and 29 were followed for 3 to 34 months (mean 15). Diagnoses obtained by electrocardiographic criteria (23 patients) or electrophysiologic testing (18 patients) included permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia in 15 children, paroxysmal atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardias (AVRT) in 13, atrial ectopic tachycardia in 4, atrial flutter in 1, chaotic atrial tachycardia in 5 and junctional ectopic tachycardia in 3. Encainide was completely effective in 54% (22 of 41 study patients) and partially effective in an additional 24% (10 of 41 patients), when combined with propranolol or verapamil. Within 1 month, 13 (32%) discontinued encainide for inefficacy or intolerance. Encainide was most effective in the treatment of permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (60% effective) and AVRT (69% effective). It controlled only 40% of primary atrial tachycardias. Encainide was well tolerated on a long-term basis in patients not experiencing symptoms during initiation. In study infants younger than age 6 months, encainide was associated with excessive QRS aberrancy during initiation in 4 of 13 (31%), compared with 3 of 28 (11%) in older children. Ventricular proarrhythmia occurred in 2 children and 1 died suddenly. Mean effective encainide dose was 3.5 mg/kg/day or 86 mg/m2/day. In 4 children who had nonextensive metabolism of encainide, the drug was ineffective. Encainide is effective in the treatment of some resistant forms of permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia and AVRT in otherwise healthy children. Children younger than age 6 months and those with either previous proarrhythmic events or severe cardiac dysfunction appear to have a high incidence of adverse effects.\r"

Oral encainide (75 to 200 mg/day), administered to 47 patients for an average of 4.7 months, was effective in 77%, and oral quinidine (1,200 mg/day), administered to 44 patients for an average of 3.2 months, was effective in 66% of the patients (difference not significant). When the duration of therapy at each crossover period was compared, the percentage of patients who continued to take encainide was consistently higher than the percentage who continued to take quinidine (p less than 0.01). Twenty-nine percent of the patients discontinued encainide treatment, 23% because of clinical inefficacy and 6% because of adverse effects. Fifty-nine percent of the patients discontinued quinidine treatment, 20% because of inefficacy and 39% because of adverse effects. Based on antiarrhythmic efficacy, encainide is at least as effective as quinidine in the treatment of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, because of encainide's much greater tolerability, it was distinctly superior in terms of clinical use. This study was an open-design, randomized crossover trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of encainide with those of quinidine in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

In this review, 11 patients with primary atrial tachycardia and 10 patients with symptomatic PACs were abstracted from all studies known to have been performed. These patients had been shown to be highly resistant to prior antiarrhythmic treatments. Intravenous encainide terminated a primary atrial tachycardia in 4 of 4 patients, 3 of whom had an incessant arrhythmia, and oral encainide was effective or partially effective in 6 of 10 patients treated for an average of 2.9 years with a mean dosage of 156 mg/day. Intravenous encainide was effective or partially effective in 8 of 10 patients with symptomatic PACs, and oral encainide was effective or partially effective in 6 of 9 patients treated for an average of 1.8 years with a mean dosage of 114 mg/day. The median number of PACs per hour on Holter recording was reduced from a baseline rate of 1,139/hour to 166/hour at 3 to 5 months of treatment (p = 0.001). Adverse effects were modest. The mechanism of action of encainide in these arrhythmias appears to be depression of ectopic pacemaker activity.\r"

Although 20% of patients had a history of congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly, or cardiomyopathy at entry, there was no case of new or worsened heart failure. There were 5 cases (1.4%) of proarrhythmia in adults, reflecting a worsening of the arrhythmia being treated or of a coexisting ventricular arrhythmia. The profile of drug-related adverse effects was comparable to that previously reported, causing discontinuance in 6% of patients. The effects most often seen were dizziness, visual disturbance, headache, nausea and vertigo. Only 1 patient had clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, possibly reflecting hepatocellular injury in conjunction with viral hepatitis. Most responders received a daily dose of 75 to 200 mg/day, generally given in 3 divided doses. Encainide has a very favorable safety profile for use in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Before infusion, breath pentane was significantly higher and alpha-toc was significantly lower in the HPN group than in the control subjects. These two measurements were significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.54, p less than 0.05). Pentane, alpha-toc, and Se-GSHPx were significantly increased in both groups after lipid was infused but were still significantly higher in HPN patients than in control subjects. Thus, infusion of a small amount of lipid rich in linoleic acid induced a significant increase in breath pentane, reflective of increased lipid peroxidation.\r"

There were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in plasma levels of free carnitine, short-chain acyl carnitine, and total carnitine in trauma patients receiving lipid-based TPN. No significant differences in urinary carnitine excretion were noted between groups.

Blood and urine measurements were obtained on day 3 of each formula. Acetate, which is metabolized to bicarbonate, increased blood pH and decreased renal acid excretion. Urinary Ca decreased in every patient from 422 +/- 63 to 240 +/- 46 mg/d (10.5 +/- 1.6 to 6.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/d) and from 468 +/- 68 to 285 +/- 54 mg/d (11.7 +/- 1.7 to 7.1 +/- 1.3 mmol/d) during continuous and cyclic TPN, respectively.

Preimmunization, which profoundly augments systemic listeria resistance, had no effect on this increased uterine susceptibility. Anti-listerial responses in other organs were unaffected by pseudopregnancy. Animals manifesting increased susceptibility formed distinct uterine swellings in response to the combination of hormones and uterine listeria. These swellings correspond to previously described deciduoma and closely mimic the decidualized endometrium of pregnancy. The nature of the defective response to listeria was investigated by immunocytochemistry. Increased bacterial titers were correlated with an inability of macrophages and T lymphocytes to reach tissue listeria in discrete regions of deciduoma-bearing uteri. Control uteri showed a normal granulomatous pattern of inflammation. These findings closely parallel previous findings in the murine decidua basalis and suggest that properties of decidualized endometrial stromal cells regulate local immune responsiveness.\r"

Twenty-three cases of AILD and two cases of hyperimmune reaction (HR) were investigated. In the two HR cases, essentially the same histologic pattern was present as in AILD but lymph node follicles were hyperplastic. Both HR cases showed germline configuration for the TcR and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes. All other patients diagnosed with AILD had clonal rearrangements for TcR gamma and beta chain genes. In addition, seven out of these cases had clonally rearranged their IgH genes. These two different rearrangement patterns (TcR with or without Ig gene rearrangement) correlated to immunohistochemical and clinical data. Cases with TcR but without Ig gene rearrangements (group I) exclusively showed CD4+ proliferating T cells, whereas those cases with TcR and Ig gene rearrangements had significantly elevated numbers of CD8+ proliferating cells (group II). Group II patients significantly more often presented with hemolytic anemia and went into transient remission spontaneously or under steroid treatment. Group I patients, however, had a higher response to chemotherapy and a longer survival time. These data show that, based on different rearrangement patterns, it is possible to divide AILD into two different groups with distinct immunophenotypic properties and differences in clinical parameters. Immunogenotyping in AILD thus will have prognostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

A striking hypersegmentation of neutrophil nuclei is observed between 30 and 48 hours. The bone marrow at 4 and 12 hours exhibits an increase in number, mitoses, size, and cytoplasmic granulation of myeloblasts and promyelocytes but a decrease in mature neutrophils, demonstrating that G-CSF acts not only as a mitogen and growth factor for early cells in the myeloid series but also as a releasing factor for mature marrow neutrophils. The bone marrow at 48 hours contains slightly increased numbers of myelocytes and metamyelocytes and large numbers of hypersegmented neutrophils. Dexamethasone and gamma-interferon inhibit the magnitude of G-CSF-induced neutrophilia, suggesting that endogenous glucocorticosteroids and gamma-interferon, both which are released along with G-CSF in vivo during endotoxemia, may play a negative feedback role in the endogenous regulation of granulopoiesis. G-CSF may act in concert with other monokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) to induce the changes in circulating numbers of leukocytes noted during endotoxemia.\r"

There were high incidences of muscle rigidity, bradycardia and hypotension during induction. Hypotension was dose- and concentration-dependent. Signs of light anaesthesia during maintenance were controlled rapidly by increasing the target plasma concentration. Nine patients required naloxone at the end of surgery. Ventilatory depression recurred in three of these. The use of published alfentanil pharmacokinetic data from elderly patients to predict plasma concentrations during prolonged infusion resulted in significant prediction errors, notably in the higher concentration range.\r"

Recipients of lung/heart allografts may be particularly prone to pulmonary infection due to systemic immunosuppression and the fact that defense mechanisms in the transplanted lung may be further impaired through tissue incompatibility and the effects of surgery. In this study, we monitored 16 lung transplant recipients for infection with Pneumocystis carinii using serial bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and found the prevalence of Pneumocystis infection of the lung to be 88%. Six episodes were associated with the usual symptoms of pneumonia, whereas 10 episodes were associated with minimal or no symptoms. In 3 of the 6 symptomatic episodes, a concurrent bacterial infection was also found. The total number of cells recovered from the lung by BAL, the proportion of T-lymphocytes, and the number of cytotoxic/suppressor and helper/inducer cells were elevated during infection with Pneumocystis compared to before and after. Spontaneous and interleukin-2-induced proliferation of BAL cells in vitro was also higher during infection, suggesting that there was an increased number of activated T-lymphocytes in the airspaces of the infected allograft. BAL cells cultured with irradiated spleen cells from the donor proliferated at higher levels when obtained after Pneumocystis infection than when obtained before or during infection even for subclinical infections. These results indicate that in the absence of prophylaxis, the prevalence of Pneumocystis infestation is very high after lung/heart transplantation. Impaired defense of the transplanted lung does not seem to stem from the inability of activated T-lymphocytes to accumulate in the allograft.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have retrospectively analyzed the results of lymph node biopsies obtained from 27 patients referred to the Infectious Diseases Service for evaluation of generalized lymphadenopathy and suspected AIDS during a recent 18-month period. Fourteen of the patients were heterosexual IVDAs, 7 were male homosexual IVDAs, and 6 were male homosexual non-IVDAs. All of the patients were residents of the Bronx, New York. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) was the most frequent diagnosis established on lymph node biopsies from IVDAs, in 12 out of 21 (57%). Tuberculous adenitis was not diagnosed in the 6 non-IVDAs. All TB patients were febrile, 11 (91%) had lost weight, and 10 (84%) had an abnormal chest roentgenogram. The 5TU PPD skin test, however, was reactive in only 2 (16%) of 12 patients. Tuberculosis is important to consider in patient populations with exposure histories to both AIDS and TB. The alarmingly high prevalence of TB in this drug addict population emphasizes the importance of lymph node biopsies with acid-fast smears and mycobacterial cultures in symptomatic IVDAs. Preventive antituberculosis therapy for HIV-positive persons, especially IVDAs, with a history of positive tuberculin reactions or of recent household contact should be seriously considered.\r"

We postulated that this phenomenon may be related to improved arterial oxygenation, reduced ventilation, or stimulation of nasal receptors caused by the flow of gas. Eight patients who reported this phenomenon were studied in a quiet room. Each patient received zero flow, 2, or 4 L/min of air or oxygen through nasal cannula for 5 min at each level in random order in a single blind manner. At the end of each period, arterial blood gas composition was measured, and breathlessness was assessed with a visual analog scale. The scale was calibrated to read from zero (not at all breathless) to 100 (extremely short of breath). The entire protocol was repeated after application of topical lidocaine to the nasal passages. Results were assessed by analysis of variance. We found no significant effect of inspired oxygen concentration, gas flow, arterial oxygen tension, or arterial carbon dioxide tension on breathlessness. There was, however, a significant increase in breathlessness after nasal anesthesia from 44 +/- 3 SEM to 52 +/- 4 SEM (p less than 0.005). We suggest that the reduction of breathlessness in these patients by nasal oxygen is a placebo effect caused by wearing the nasal cannulas and is unrelated to gas flow or the increased arterial oxygen tension.\r"

Pretreatment with isotonic DSCG resulted in significantly greater reduction in exercise-induced bronchospasm (10 patients) than with hypotonic DSCG. In addition, the dose of methacholine required to induce a decrease greater than 20% in FEV1 was significantly higher following pretreatment with isotonic DSCG compared with placebo or hypotonic solution of the drug (11 patients). We conclude that nebulized isotonic DSCG provides better protection against exercise- and methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction than does the standard solution.

We have previously shown that t-bu-OOH stimulates arachidonic acid metabolism, increasing the synthesis of the cyclooxygenase products. The current experiments were designed to determine the role that cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived mediators play in the lung injury caused by t-bu-OOH. In the present experiments, we found that t-bu-OOH not only increased the synthesis of the cyclooxygenase-derived products thromboxane and prostacyclin but also increased the synthesis of the lipoxygenase-derived products leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4. To determine the role that these arachidonic acid metabolites play in the increase in pressure and vascular permeability caused by t-bu-OOH, we studied the effect that inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism or a leukotriene receptor blocker had on the pulmonary edema. We compared an uninjured control group with 4 groups of lungs given t-bu-OOH: a t-bu-OOH control group; a group pretreated with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (14 microM); a group pretreated with an analogue of arachidonic acid, 5-, 8-, 11-, 14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) (100 microM), that inhibits both the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways; and a group pretreated with the leukotriene receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (38 microM). To produce lung injury, t-bu-OOH (300 microM) was infused throughout the first minute of 4 successive 10-min periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in serum and simultaneous measurements of serotonin (SER) and propranolol (PROP) pulmonary extraction along with several physiologic parameters were determined and compared with those obtained in a control group (n = 5) before and then at 2-h intervals for 8 h after administration of the toxic agent. ACE activity in serum showed a sustained and significant increase in the PMA and OA groups throughout the whole study period, whereas it decreased significantly at 4 h in the ANTU group. SER pulmonary uptake decreased significantly, but slightly, only in the PMA group at 8 h (-5%). At 6 and 8 h respectively, PROP extraction dropped significantly in the PMA (-11 and -13%) and OA (-13 and -19%) groups. This decrease in PROP extraction was likely to result from physiologic changes due to the development of pulmonary edema as suggested by the correlation between the changes in amine uptake and those affecting pulmonary artery pressure and total static respiratory compliance. The lack of effects on SER uptake by the lungs under these experimental conditions indicate that dissociation exists between metabolic dysfunction of pulmonary endothelial cells and fluid leakage.\r"

  ".W": "Quadriplegics are able to compensate for alterations of operational length of the diaphragm by reflexly increasing neural drive to the diaphragm. This increase in neural drive is adequate to maintain required tidal volume and minute ventilation during quiet breathing in these patients with limited inspiratory muscle function. It is not known, however, if this neural compensation is sufficient to preserve ventilation when the diaphragm is stressed by simultaneously changing its operational length and increasing ventilatory demands. This issue was explored in 7 quadriplegics whose vital capacity was reduced to 15 to 53% of predicted. The diaphragm was stressed by shortening its length from the supine to a 60 degree tilted position, and also by inducing hyperventilation by having the subjects rebreathe 7% CO2. Response to this stress was recorded by monitoring the ventilatory response to rebreathing CO2 (delta VE/delta PCO2), and also by measuring mouth pressure 0.1 s after occluding the airway at the start of inspiration during CO2 rebreathing (delta P0.1/delta PCO2). A change from the supine to the tilted position caused an increase in resting end-expiratory volume of 0.8 +/- 0.2 L (SD) and therefore shortened the diaphragm. Despite this shortening of diaphragm length and the stress of CO2 rebreathing, there was no significant change in delta VE/delta PCO2 and delta P0.1/delta PCO2 with changes in posture. The delta VE/delta PCO2 was 0.82 +/- 0.42 L/min/mm Hg supine versus 0.95 +/- 0.65 L/min/mm Hg when tilted. The delta P0.1/delta PCO2 was 0.18 +/- 0.08 cm H2O/mm Hg supine versus 0.20 +/- 0.10 cm H2O/mm Hg tilted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Positive cultures of protected brush specimens (greater than 10(3) cfu/ml) were found in only 45 patients (31%). Subsequent follow-up confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia in 34 of 45 patients, and in only 4 of 45 patients was a positive culture firmly established to be a false positive result. No patient with less than 10(3) cfu/ml was subsequently shown to have had pneumonia, and the diagnosis was definitely excluded in 72 of 102 patients by the absence of pneumonia at autopsy or recovery without antibiotic therapy. In contrast, when 16 clinical variables were evaluated by stepwise logistic regression analysis, no combination could be identified that was useful in distinguishing patients with bacterial pneumonia. Furthermore, when the actual costs of evaluation and therapy of our patients were compared with the projected costs entailed in treating all patients suspected of having pneumonia with antibiotics, evaluation using the protected specimen brush and quantitative cultures was less expensive after only 6 days of treatment. These results suggest that the appearance of pulmonary infiltrates and purulent tracheal secretions does not result from bacterial pneumonia in a majority of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Muscarinic agonists are potent constrictors of airway smooth muscle. In many tissues, muscarinic agonists also reduce intracellular cyclic AMP by inhibiting its synthesis. In airway smooth muscle, the role muscarinic agonists have in the regulation of cyclic AMP content is not established. The hypothesis of our study was that muscarinic agonists reduce cyclic AMP accumulation in dog tracheal smooth muscle, and that this reduction involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive regulatory protein (Gi) that couples occupancy of the muscarinic receptor by the agonist to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. We measured cyclic AMP accumulation in tracheal smooth muscle from 4 dogs, and found that acetylcholine (10(-4) M) diminished basal and isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation by 37.6 +/- 12.1% and 39.4 +/- 1.9%, respectively (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.05). This reduction of cyclic AMP was dose-dependent and inhibited by atropine (10(-5) M). Incubation of dog tracheal smooth muscle with pertussis toxin (12.5 micrograms/ml) for 21 h catalyzed covalent modification of a membrane protein with an approximate Mr of 40,000. In control strips, acetylcholine decreased isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP content by 33.7 +/- 5.6% (p less than 0.05). However, in strips treated with pertussis toxin (10 micrograms/ml), acetylcholine decreased cyclic AMP by only 7.9 +/- 4.8%; this change was not significant. Thus, pertussis toxin (10 micrograms/ml) attenuated muscarinic cholinergic regulation of cyclic AMP. These findings are consistent with muscarinic cholinergic regulation of adenylate cyclase via Gi in dog tracheal smooth muscle. In addition, the techniques we employed should permit the evaluation of other functions of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in airway smooth muscle.\r"

We predicted that this increase in caliber would decrease the number of apneas and sleep time spent apneic. In contrast, suppression of the ventilatory system activity with hyperoxia was predicted to decrease both inspiratory muscle activity and pharyngeal caliber and thereby increase the number of apneas and apnea time. In all 7 patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea studied, 3 with upper airway narrowing obvious during wakefulness, inhalation of 3 to 6% CO2 preferentially stimulated upper airway inspiratory muscle tonic electrical activity relative to the activity of chest wall inspiratory muscles and diminished periodic breathing. Apnea time decreased from 60 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) of sleep time during ambient air inhalation to 12 +/- 3% during CO2 inhalation; 50% O2 had the reverse effect on inspiratory muscle tonic electrical activity and increased apnea time to 75 +/- 5% of sleep time. We conclude that manipulation of inspiratory muscle tonic activity and alteration of the pattern of breathing by CO2 and O2 inhalation lead to significant changes in the pattern of upper airway inspiratory collapse during sleep. We speculate that physiologic variables related to the control of upper airway inspiratory muscle function are instrumental in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea.\r"

Resolution by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of products from [3H]arachidonic-acid-labeled and zymosan-activated PMN demonstrated that, in addition to LTB4, there was enhanced metabolism to 6-trans-LTB4, omega-oxidation metabolites of LTB4 and 5-HETE.

There was no significant enhancement in LTB4 generation by PMN in 6 asthmatic subjects after methacholine-induced bronchospasm, and after exercise in 6 subjects who did not develop asthma.

Twelve normal subjects were studied during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (Stages 2 to 4) while receiving negative (NPV, 8 subjects) or positive (PPV, 4 subjects) pressure ventilation and during spontaneous breathing. EMGdia (surface), end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2), esophageal pressure (Pe), and ventilation were measured with a flow-through hood (NPV) or a mask (PPV). The following results were obtained during steady-state (3 to 22 min) mechanical ventilation. (1) A decrease in PETCO2 of 2 to 6 mm Hg resulted in elimination of phasic EMGdia in all subjects. Inhibition of respiratory muscle EMG (and a positive shift in Pe) occurred coincident with the breath-by-breath reduction in PETCO2, so that EMGdia was usually eliminated after the initial 4 to 6 breaths while using the ventilator. (2) Returning PETCO2 to the spontaneous sleeping level by adding CO2 to the inspired air (isocapnic mechanical ventilation) caused significant increases in EMGdia. During this isocapnic mechanical ventilation, however, EMGdia usually remained less than during eucapnic control. (3) Stopping the ventilator during hypocapnic ventilation caused a prolongation of expiratory time (TE) that was proportional to the degree of hypocapnia during the mechanical ventilation (100 to 1,200% increase over control). During isocapnic ventilation, cessation of mechanical ventilation caused no change in TE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In these studies, we demonstrate that supernatants of silica-stimulated human alveolar macrophages cause significantly (p less than 0.05) greater amounts of fibroblast proliferation than do supernatants of macrophages stimulated with optimal amounts of endotoxin (LPS). The amount of fibroblast proliferation was similar (p greater than 0.2) in the presence of supernatants of LPS-stimulated macrophages and supernatants of unstimulated adherent macrophages. When macrophages were stimulated with LPS in the presence of indomethacin (to inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid), the supernatants stimulated the same amount of proliferation of fibroblasts as did supernatants of silica-stimulated macrophages. Indomethacin did not increase the growth factor activity of supernatants of silica-stimulated or unstimulated macrophages. Consistent with these observations, supernatants of LPS-stimulated macrophages contained 25.5 +/- 3.8 nM of PGE2, whereas supernatants of silica-stimulated macrophages and unstimulated macrophages contained essentially no PGE2. These findings were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. The amounts of PGE2 present in supernatants of LPS-stimulated macrophages were sufficient to cause a 75% reduction in the proliferation of maximally stimulated fibroblasts. These studies suggest that silica may be a very effective stimulus for fibroblast proliferation in vivo since it causes macrophages to release growth factors for fibroblasts without triggering the release of PGE2, an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of antigen (ovalbumin) challenge on pulmonary hemodynamics, bronchoconstriction, and fluid filtration was investigated in Ringer's-perfused (non-recirculating) lungs that had been passively sensitized in vitro. Bolus ovalbumin injection (30 micrograms) produced immediate increases in pulmonary arterial pressure, peak intratracheal pressure, and lung weight within 1 min and secondary marked increases in intratracheal pressure and lung weight from 120 to 200 min. Electron microscopy of antigen-challenged isolated lungs showed evidence of both septal and intraalveolar edema. Ionophore A23187 (100 micrograms) challenge of nonsensitized lungs produced immediate pulmonary responses similar to antigen, whereas secondary increases in lung weight were smaller. Arachidonic acid pretreatment (1 microM) potentiated immediate antigen-induced increases in intratracheal pressure but did not affect pulmonary responses to ionophore challenge. Putative mediators of anaphylaxis including histamine, leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4, platelet-activating factor, and substance P produced immediate changes in pulmonary arterial and/or intratracheal pressure similar to antigen challenge. Only platelet-activating factor and substance P partially mimicked the secondary edema formation noted following antigen challenge. Thus, antigen challenge in in vitro sensitized guinea pig lungs produced both immediate and secondary responses characterized by increases in vascular pressure, airway pressure, and edema formation. This occurred in the absence of circulating blood-formed elements and without a massive influx of cells. Synergism between mediators such as histamine, the leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, and substance P released following antigen challenge may be necessary to produce the complete pathophysiological sequelae associated with antigen challenge in the perfused guinea pig lung.\r"

Repeated measurements of arterial blood gases, maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (P1max), 12-min walking distance, and respiratory cycle were performed during a 1-month run-in period. Quality of life and transdiaphragmatic pressure were measured once. All patients completed the planned 4-month study. Four of them were ventilated for longer periods because CV could not be discontinued at the end of the study. PaCO2 showed a significant fall starting during the first month; PaO2 significantly increased from the second month, whereas P1max significantly rose from the third month on. Maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure increased in the 2 patients with abnormal baseline values. The fall in PaCO2 was associated with an increase in tidal volume because of a longer inspiratory time. Significant improvements in quality of life and in the 12-min walking distance were observed. We conclude that weekly CV improves blood gases, inspiratory muscle strength, and clinical conditions of patients with chronic air-flow limitation and chronic hypercarbia, probably because of correction of chronic inspiratory muscle fatigue.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of nutritional support on nitrogen-energy relationships and functional parameters in malnourished patients with emphysema. Malnourished patients without lung disease served as the control group. Ten ambulatory, stable patients with emphysema and six patients without lung disease received an infusion of 5% dextrose (baseline) plus electrolytes (D5W) for two days, which was followed by an enteral or a parenteral infusion of either a carbohydrate-based (CB, 53% carbohydrate) or a fat-based diet (FB, 55% fat) for 1 wk each, in a randomized cross-over design. All patients had greater than 10% weight loss. Caloric intake was set at 1.7 times the resting energy expenditure (REE) as measured during the baseline period. The REE of patients with emphysema was 23 and 27% above that of the control group during baseline and refeeding periods, respectively. The increased REE was met primarily by an increased carbohydrate oxidation. During the infusion of D5W, N balance was lower in patients with emphysema, but during repletion N balance was similar in both groups of patients. Two weeks of nutritional support with either a CB or a FB diet increased body weight, N balance, and arm muscle area and improved maximal inspiratory pressure, skeletal muscle strength, and endurance-strength (using quadriceps, hamstring, and handgrip) to a similar degree in malnourished patients with and without lung disease. In other stress states, such as infection, it has been shown that hypermetabolism, hypercatabolism, and preferential fat oxidation occur concomitantly. Patients with emphysema are unusual because, although they are hypermetabolic, they are not hypercatabolic and do not demonstrate preferential fat oxidation.\r"

When stimulated with 1 microgram/ml of the calcium ionophore A23187 for 15 min at 37 degrees C, eosinophils with densities greater than 1.093 g/ml from asthmatic and normal subjects released 19.1 +/- 4.2 ng LTC4/10(6) eosinophils and 23.9 +/- 5.0 ng LTC4/10(6) eosinophils, respectively. In contrast, lower density eosinophils (densities 1.093 g/ml or less) isolated from the asthmatic subjects released significantly less LTC4 than did eosinophils of similar densities from normal subjects (41.6 +/- 3.0 versus 79.0 +/- 6.7 ng LTC4/10(6) eosinophils, p less than 0.05). Differences could not be demonstrated between the two subject groups in LTC4 metabolism, time course of extracellular release of LTC4, or dose response to A23187, nor were interactions between eosinophils and neutrophils with regard to LTC4 release evident. Thus, hypodense eosinophils elaborate greater quantities of LTC4 than do eosinophils of normal density whether obtained from normal or asthmatic subjects. However, the finding that peripheral blood eosinophils from asthmatic subjects have decreased capacity for the synthesis of LTC4 compared with cells of similar densities isolated from normal subjects demonstrates that the capacity of eosinophils to produce LTC4 is regulated by factors that are not necessarily reflected in the cell density.\r"

  ".W": "The patterns of lung eicosanoid production were investigated in five different species by stimulating isolated lungs with calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M). The species studied were the rat, ferret, hamster, guinea pig, and rabbit. The eicosanoids measured included the cyclooxygenase metabolites 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, TxB2, and PGE2 and the lipoxygenase metabolites LTC4, LTD4, and LTB4. Since these metabolites are either retained in the lungs or released into the perfusate, eicosanoids were measured in lung tissue and in the perfusate. In all animal species, calcium ionophore stimulated the production of all the eicosanoid metabolites measured, although in different relative proportions and quantities. The sulfidopeptide LTC4 was predominantly retained in the lung tissue while other eicosanoids were distributed more evenly between tissue and perfusate, with tissue levels generally being higher. The ferret lung produced large quantities of eicosanoids, more than 90% being lipoxygenase products. In contrast, the guinea pig lung produced predominantly cyclooxygenase products, especially TxB2. The rat, hamster, and rabbit lungs showed a more even distribution of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products. Species differences in the ability to produce lipid mediators in the lung may be important in determining the vasoconstrictive, bronchoconstrictive, or inflammatory response to physiologic stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "Although recent reports have described arachidonic acid metabolism of individual types of lung cells, the actual profile of eicosanoids that are produced in the lung may reflect interactions between different cell types. Because macrophages and epithelial cells are in close physical contact within the alveolus, we measured the eicosanoids produced by combined cultures of these cells. We found that the [14C]arachidonic acid that was released from previously labeled epithelial cells following A23187 stimulation was metabolized by alveolar macrophages to leukotriene B4 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, which are products not normally produced by these epithelial cells. Simultaneously, there was a decrease in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the end product of prostacyclin metabolism and a major product of epithelial cell arachidonate metabolism but not macrophage arachidonate metabolism. A net increase in leukotriene B4 and a net decrease in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were demonstrated by radioimmunoassay. Thus, the interaction of stimulated alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells alters the eicosanoid profile produced by each cell type alone in a manner that would tend to accentuate inflammatory processes within the alveolus.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary intravascular macrophages are a recently identified component of the pulmonary mononuclear phagocyte system. It has been shown that alveolar macrophages are capable of metabolizing arachidonic acid (AA) to its biologically active inflammatory metabolites via the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. In this study, we have compared the ability of swine intravascular macrophages and alveolar macrophages to metabolize AA in vitro. Alveolar macrophages attached to a plastic substrate produced at least five identified AA metabolites including prostaglandin (PG)F2 alpha, hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT), 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 12-HETE, and 15-HETE. In contrast, adherent intravascular macrophages produced eight identified metabolites including thromboxane (TX)B2, PGF2 alpha, PGD2, PGE2, HHT, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE. The major lipoxygenase metabolite produced by both macrophage types was 5-HETE. The major cyclooxygenase metabolite produced by alveolar macrophages was PGF2 alpha, whereas the major metabolite produced by intravascular macrophages was HHT. Both macrophage populations treated with calcium ionophore (A23187) exhibited increased production of PGs, TXB2, leukotriene (LT)B4, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, and 15-HETE, but the most striking increase occurred in metabolism through the lipoxygenase pathway. The major lipoxygenase metabolite generated by ionophore-stimulated macrophages was 5-HETE, and in intravascular macrophages 12-HETE was also produced. Preincubation of macrophages with indomethacin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid attenuated the yield of cyclooxygenase metabolites and lipoxygenase metabolites, respectively. Studies of leukotriene formation demonstrated that both macrophage types produce LTC4 and LTB4 from the leukotriene precursor LTA4. Thus, we show that the pulmonary intravascular macrophage is capable of metabolizing AA and LTA4 to their inflammatory and vasoactive metabolites by the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The highest agar-determined MICs (in 7H10 and 7H11 agar) corresponded well with the critical concentrations established for these media. The highest MICs found radiometrically in 7H12 broth were significantly lower than the critical concentrations proposed for this medium. On the basis of an evaluation of the highest broth-determined MICs found in this and in the previous study (1), we suggest that the following MICs, when determined radiometrically, should be used as breakpoints to classify the strain as \"susceptible\": for INH, 0.1 microgram/ml or less; for RMP, 0.5 microgram/ml or less; for EMB, 4.0 micrograms/ml or less; for SM, 2.0 micrograms/ml or less.\r"

Because of recent advances in flow cytometry and in the development of fluorescent labeling compounds, such as allophycocyanin, autofluorescence can be minimized by the use of red excitation and emission wavelengths. We have developed a three-step labeling technique that discretely identifies the minor subpopulation of normal rat alveolar macrophages that express Class II major histocompatibility (Ia) antigens. Using this technique, we observed that alveolar macrophage Ia antigen expression increases at least fourfold after intravenous administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin to previously primed rats. Additionally, we observed that in vitro treatment of alveolar macrophages by exposure to gamma interferon results in an increase in Ia antigen expression. This new method is significant because flow cytometry is a powerful tool with which to analyze quickly, accurately, and reproducibly alveolar macrophage surface antigens.\r"

[14C]AA-prelabeled AM constitutively released free [14C]AA and release increased significantly with A23187 incubation. Under resting conditions, unlabeled cells produced small amounts of immunoreactive thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). With A23187 stimulation there were significant increases in the synthesis of all immunoreactive metabolites, which were produced in the following relative amounts: LTB4 much greater than TxB2 greater than PGD2 greater than leukotriene C4 greater than PGE2. High performance liquid chromatographic separation of radiolabeled eicosanoids produced by prelabeled cells confirmed the radioimmunoassay results and further indicated the production of relatively large amounts of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid. Pretreatment (16 h) with 1 microM methylprednisolone inhibited A23187-induced synthesis of immunoreactive cyclooxygenase products to a greater extent than immunoreactive leukotrienes. We identified no significant differences among the three study groups in the quantities or profiles of eicosanoids synthesized either constitutively or with A23187 stimulation, nor in their regulation by methylprednisolone.\r"

Inhalation of ovalbumin by sensitized guinea pigs induced three phases of airways obstruction: an early asthmatic response (EAR) peaking at 2 h, a late response (LAR) peaking at 17 h, and a further late response (LLAR) being observed at 72 h. The LAR was accompanied by a 13-fold rise in neutrophils and a four-fold rise in eosinophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at 17 h. By 72 h, the BAL content of neutrophils had returned to near normal, whereas eosinophil numbers had risen to 6.7-fold above baseline. Inhalation of an aerosolized solution of cromolyn, 10 mg/ml, 15 min before challenge inhibited both the EAR and LAR and the influx of neutrophils into the airways at 17 h but had no effect on eosinophil accumulation. Inhalation of cromolyn at 6 h, i.e., after the completion of the EAR, inhibited the LAR, the LLAR, and the rise in eosinophils at 72 h but did not reduce the influx of neutrophils at 17 h. Administration of cromolyn at both 15 min before and 6 h after challenge inhibited all changes in sGaw and reduced the accumulation of neutrophils at 17 h and the influx of eosinophils at 72 h. In contrast, inhalation of albuterol, 0.1 mg/ml, 15 min before allergen provocation blocked the EAR and the rise in BAL neutrophils at 17 h but did not inhibit the LAR. Inhalation of albuterol at 6 h partially reversed the LAR but had no effect on either the LLAR or cellular changes. Given at both times, albuterol inhibited the EAR and neutrophil accumulation at 17 h and partially reversed the LAR but produced no other effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Compared with normal subjects, there was an increased percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils in the lung lavage, increased Dev (p less than 0.002) with no significant difference in Vb, increased MRglc (p less than 0.02), 99mTc-DTPA clearance (p less than 0.002), and 67Ga uptake (p less than 0.02).

There were inverse correlations between Dev and both FVC and TLC, but a direct correlation between Vb and transfer factor. 99mTc-DTPA clearance changed concordantly with clinical status and radiographic and respiratory function changes during the first year. If glucose utilization (MRglc) remained in the normal range between the initial and first yearly assessment, the patient improved or remained stable during the second year as shown by clinical status and radiographic and respiratory function measurements.

Significantly enhanced P. aeruginosa colony-forming units (CFU) were found in all (12 of 12) rat lungs 48 h after challenge compared to partially starved rats (p less than 0.025) or untreated rats (p less than 10(-6)). Pretreatment of normal rat lungs with elastase from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN-elastase) resulted in extensive tissue damage, and 48 h after bacterial challenge the mean P. aeruginosa CFU of 12 animals was significantly higher 1.1 X 10(4) +/- 1.0 X 10(4) CFU; p less than 0.01) than in the reserpinized rat lungs. P. aeruginosa organisms were also found in PMN-elastase-treated rat lungs not challenged with bacteria (five of 12 animals), suggesting cross infection from infected animals in the same cage. In immunized rats that were challenged with aerosolized antigen (bovine serum albumin) and P. aeruginosa, bacterial CFU after 10 h were significantly higher than in nonimmune animals (p less than 0.005), and highest after 48 h when P. aeruginosa alkaline proteinase was used as the antigen (1.2 X 10(5) +/- 1.4 X 10(5) CFU). These data provide new evidence that clearance of P. aeruginosa from lung tissue is impaired after malnutrition, epithelial cell alteration, or epithelial cell damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using an animal model of acute respiratory failure (ARF), we evaluated two treatments: conventional mechanical pulmonary ventilation (MV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with extracorporeal removal of CO2 by an artificial membrane lung. We developed a model of \"mild\" ARF and a model of \"severe\" ARF after ventilating healthy sheep at a peak inspiratory pressure of 50 cm H2O for various lengths of time. Sheep from either injury models were randomly assigned to one of the above treatment groups. All 16 sheep from the model with \"severe\" ARF died, with progressive deterioration in pulmonary function and multiorgan failure irrespective of the treatment. Of 11 sheep from the model with \"mild\" ARF treated by MV, only three survived, whereas all 11 sheep from the model with \"mild\" ARF treated with CPAP and extracorporeal removal of CO2 responded well, and nine sheep ultimately recovered. We conclude that CPAP with extracorporeal removal of CO2 provided a better environment for the recovery in our model with \"mild\" ARF than the conventional arrangement centered on MV alone. Our studies also suggest that lung injury can progress (i.e., model with \"severe\" ARF) to where neither of the two treatments can succeed.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the role of CO2 responsiveness and breathing efficiency in limiting exercise capacity in 15 patients with chronic airway obstruction (FEV1 = 0.88 +/- 0.25 L, mean +/- SD). Responses of minute ventilation and P0.1 (mouth pressure 0.1 s after the onset of occluded inspiration) to hypercapnia (delta VE/delta PCO2, delta P0.1/delta PCO2) were measured by rebreathing, and the ratio of the two (delta VE/delta P0.1) was defined as an index of breathing efficiency during hyperventilation. Exercise capacity was measured as symptom-limited, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max/BW) in an incremental treadmill test and also as the 12-min walking distance (TMD). All patients discontinued the treadmill test because of dyspnea, and the exercise capacity correlated with the degree of airway obstruction, although there was a wide variability among patients with comparable FEV1. There were no significant correlations between the responses to CO2 and exercise capacity. However, there was a significant correlation between delta VE/delta P0.1 and VO2max/BW (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001) or TMD (r = 0.78, p less than 0.001), and these correlations remained significant even when the relational effects of FEV1 were taken out. These results support the hypothesis that airway obstruction and breathing efficiency are important, but that CO2 responsiveness is not a major factor in determining the exercise capacity of patients with chronic airway obstruction.\r"

We sought to evaluate the steady-state relationship between CO, and minute ventilation (VE) after positional change and after vasodilator administration in 24 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac output was 25% higher (p = 0.003) and VE was 25% lower (p = 0.0001) in the supine position. The change in VE showed a strong correlation with the change in VCO2 (r = 0.693; p = 0.0004), but not with the change in CO. Twelve patients received hydralazine 200 mg orally over 24 h, and 12 patients received nifedipine as a single 10-mg oral dose. Cardiac output increased from 5.05 +/- 1.25 L/min to 6.91 +/- 2.07 L/min (p = 0.008) after hydralazine and increased from 4.34 +/- 1.47 L/min to 5.85 +/- 2.15 L/min (p = 0.001) after nifedipine. Minute ventilation increased from 14.8 +/- 3.0 L/min to 17.3 +/- 4.4 L/min (p = 0.008) after hydralazine, but did not change after nifedipine. The change in VE showed a strong correlation with the change in VCO2 after hydralazine (r = 0.889; p = 0.0004) and after nifedipine (r = 0.756; p = 0.005), but did not correlate with the change in CO. These data demonstrate that the change in VE that accompanies positional change or vasodilator administration in patients with COPD is strongly correlated with the change in VCO2 but not with the change in CO when measured under steady-state conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise programs are a mainstay of pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD. COPD patients with elevated PCO2 are severely impaired and might benefit from rehabilitation more than other patients. However, there is no systematic data to indicate that hypercapnic COPD patients benefit from intensive rehabilitation. Indeed, in patients with hypercapnia, increased exercise might overtax respiratory muscles, which are weak relative to those of eucapnic patients. To investigate this issue, we reviewed all COPD patients admitted to our pulmonary inpatient program from 1983 to 1986 (n = 317). The program includes multiple daily sessions of upper and lower extremity exercise to tolerance. We assessed admission and discharge pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases (room air), and functional status. Ambulation distance on a 6-min walk test was used as an objective measure of functional status. Patients were grouped according to the results of their admission room air PCO2. We found that eucapnic patients (n = 197) significantly increased ambulation (admission to discharge) from 409 to 816 feet (p less than 0.001). Hypercapnic patients improved as well. Patients with moderate hypercapnia (PCO2, 45 to 54 mm Hg; n = 86) increased their ambulation from 330 to 663 feet (p less than 0.0001). Patients with severe hypercapnia (PCO2 greater than 54 mm Hg; n = 34) increased their ambulation from 336 to 597 feet (p less than 0.0001). We found a small but significant improvement in discharge pulmonary function and arterial blood gas results. We conclude that COPD patients with hypercapnia, despite severe ventilatory impairment and weak respiratory muscles, tolerate exercise well and benefit significantly from intensive inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation.\r"

In 14 patients aged 15 to 35 yr of age with advanced CF, the effects of chronic airflow limitation (CAL), increased physiologic dead space (VD), and the timing components of ventilation (VE) on gas exchange during maximal exercise were assessed. The patients were divided into those who retained CO2 during exercise, the CO2R group, and those who did not, the CO2NR group. CO2 retention was defined as a rise in end-tidal CO2 tension of 5 mm Hg or more or to a value greater than 50 mm Hg during a progressive exercise test on a cycle ergometer. CO2 retention occurred in half the subjects, usually by the halfway mark of the test, and did not rise progressively as exercise continued. It was associated with a low VE caused by a low tidal volume (VT) that was the result of a short inspiratory time to total respiratory time ratio (0.33 +/- 0.03 versus 0.38 +/- 0.04, p less than 0.02), whereas there was no difference in mean inspiratory flow or respiratory rate. Although the CO2R group had the worst CAL, with a FEV1 of 28 +/- 7 versus 41 +/- 12% predicted (p less than 0.5) and a FVC of 42 +/- 12 versus 61 +/- 9% predicted (p less than 0.01), the VT at maximal work expressed as a percentage of FVC was lower (45 +/- 13 versus 60 +/- 11, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had sputum cultures positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to isoniazid and rifampin. Of the 233 patients, 200 completed the regimen without change. Four patients had adverse reactions necessitating discontinuation and four became pregnant and had ethambutol substituted for rifampin. All eight were treated successfully with altered regimens. Ten patients were lost to follow-up, seven died, and eight were transferred to other jurisdictions. No patients failed to convert their sputum during therapy. At completion of therapy, three patients (1.5%) were found to have positive sputum. Follow-up 6 months after completion of treatment in 174 successfully treated patients revealed four (2.3%) with positive sputum. No further relapses were detected on evaluation 12 months after treatment was completed. All seven patients who failed therapy or relapsed were retreated successfully using the same regimen. These data provide a reference standard against which newer treatment regimens, such as the 6-month regimen currently in use, can be compared. In addition, the value of routine evaluations in detecting relapses at the time treatment is completed and 6 months later was substantiated, but 12-month follow-up was not useful.\r"

Arterial oxygenation can be monitored noninvasively using oximetry or transcutaneous oxygen electrodes, while mixed venous oxygenation can be recorded continuously with modified pulmonary artery catheters. A satisfactory method of monitoring carbon dioxide tension does not exist. Measurements of respiratory drive can be obtained at the bedside, but their clinical usefulness remains unknown. Assessment of respiratory muscle strength is helpful in determining the need for mechanical ventilation, but a practical method of diagnosing respiratory muscle fatigue remains elusive. Measurement of thoracic compliance and detailed examination of the breathing pattern, i.e., tidal volume, respiratory frequency, and the pattern of rib cage-abdominal motion, are helpful in assessing abnormal pulmonary mechanics. The detailed information provided by respiratory monitoring can complement but not replace careful bedside examination.\r"

In cystic fibrosis (CF), Cl secretion is impaired due to a missing Cl permeability of the apical membrane. Patch-clamp experiments have demonstrated that Cl channels are present in CF cells; however, the regulation of channel activity via the cAMP-pathway is impaired. Recent studies have shown that the CF defect is very closely associated with the Cl channel itself or with an associated, membrane-bound regulatory subunit of the Cl channel complex. Because not much is known about the molecular details of the individual transport mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved in Cl secretion in epithelial cells, recent findings on the molecular biology of these mechanisms obtained in other cellular systems are discussed.\r"

In quiet breathing the CT was active predominantly in inspiration, and distinct phasic expiratory activity was observed at lighter levels of anesthesia. Both the CT and PCA increased their inspiratory and expiratory activity with hypercapnia, whereas only their inspiratory activity increased in response to negative pressure and/or absence of volume feedback. Cold blockade of either the recurrent laryngeal nerves or the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerves did not modify CT or PCA activity. In general, activity of CT motor units reflected the behavior of the whole muscle, but different units were recruited at different levels of CT activity. Even though the majority exhibited similar thresholds for inspiration and expiration, some units showed a lower threshold for either one, suggesting some degree of specialization. However, for a few units with high threshold for inspiration the expiratory threshold could not be determined, since a comparable level of CT activity was not achieved in expiration.\r"

  ".W": "In studies of focal epilepsy it is frequently assumed that the interictal spike is the elementary form of epileptic activity and that seizure, or ictal, episodes evolve by temporal summation and spatial expansion of interictal paroxysms. We examined this hypothesis in an in vitro model of acute focal epilepsy produced by perfusing rat hippocampal slices with solutions containing moderately elevated concentrations of K+. Some of the preparations treated in this way displayed recurring electrical seizures in the CA1 field. Each seizure episode typically evolved by a seemingly smooth progression of brief interictal bursts into sustained ictal discharge. However, exposure of preparations showing electrical seizures to blockers of synaptic transmission or to cholinergic agonists abolished interictal spiking in all hippocampal fields but did not impede the initiation of ictal episodes in area CA1. Likewise, severing the connections between areas CA3 and CA1 abolished interictal spiking in area CA1 without disrupting the initiation of seizures in this region. These data clearly show that in this model, focal seizures arise independent of interictal spikes and through different cellular mechanisms. While interictal electrogenesis requires chemical synaptic excitation, ictal episodes can be initiated and maintained by nonsynaptic neuronal interactions.\r"

The state 3 respiratory rates with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked substrates and succinate were much lower than those of control subjects. The cytochrome oxidase activities (measured with ascorbate + phenazine methosulfate as substrates) were also decreased, but this segment of the respiratory chain was not rate-limiting for succinate or NAD-linked substrate oxidation. Analyses of the steady-state reduction kinetics of the respiratory chain carriers revealed that the rate-limiting step of the impaired respiration with succinate or NAD-linked substrates lies between the c cytochromes and cytochrome oxidase. Measurement of the total substrate-reducible (at anaerobiosis) and chemically reducible levels of the cytochromes in mitochondria from 3 patients showed a severe deficiency of cytochrome a + a3 and an excess of the c cytochromes. To our knowledge, this is the first instance in which a mitochondrial electron transfer defect and cytochrome oxidase deficiency has been shown to be associated with an excess of the c cytochromes.\r"

DESIGN--Double blind, placebo controlled, random order crossover trial with four week placebo run in period and two six week active phases separated by a two week placebo washout period. SETTING--Outpatient department of a general hospital in a multiethnic health department. Patients--Diabetic patients with hypertension. Four dropped out before randomisation; 25 black and 14 white patients completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS--Patients given slow release verapamil 120 mg or 240 mg twice daily with placebo or metoprolol 50 mg or 100 mg twice daily with placebo. Treatment for diabetes (diet alone or with oral hypoglycaemic drugs) remained unchanged. END POINT--Comparison of changes in blood pressure in the two groups taking both drugs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Metoprolol had little effect on blood pressure in black patients (mean fall 4.0 mm Hg systolic (95% confidence interval -2.5 to 10.4 mm Hg), 4.3 mm Hg diastolic (-0.8 to 9.5)) but more effect in white patients (mean falls 13.4 mm Hg (0.1 to 26.7) and 10.6 mm Hg (4.5 to 16.7) respectively). Verapamil was more effective in both groups, with mean falls of 8.8 mm Hg (2.4 to 15.0) and 8.1 mm Hg (5.0 to 11.2) in black patients and 19.1 mm Hg (5.4 to 32.9) and 11.4 mm Hg (0.9 to 22.0) in white patients. Heart fate fell significantly in black patients taking metoprolol, which suggested compliance with treatment. Metabolic variables were unaltered by either treatment. Plasma renin activity was low in both groups after metoprolol treatment, but change in blood pressure could not be predicted from baseline plasma renin activity. Urinary albumin:creatinine ratio was independently related to baseline blood pressure but not significantly changed by treatment. CONCLUSIONS--beta Blockers alone are not effective in treating hypertension in black diabetics. Verapamil is effective but less so than in white patients. As yet no ideal monotherapy exists for hypertension in black patients.\r"

DESIGN--Part of larger randomised trial of five different dressings. SETTING--Outpatient venous ulcer clinic in university hospital. PATIENTS--(a) Pressure exerted by both bandage systems was measured in the same 20 patients. (b) Healing with the four layer bandage was assessed in 148 legs in 126 consecutive patients (mean age 71 (SE 2); range 30-96) with chronic venous ulcers that had resisted treatment with traditional bandaging for a mean of 27.2 (SE 8) months. INTERVENTIONS--(a) Four layer bandage system or traditional adhesive plaster bandaging for pressure studies; (b) four layer bandaging applied weekly for studies of healing. END POINTS--(a) Comparison of pressures achieved at the ankle for up to one week; (b) complete healing within 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--(a) Four layer bandage produced higher initial pressures at the ankle of 42.5 (SE 1) mm Hg compared with 29.8 (1.8) for the adhesive plaster (p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval 18.5 to 6.9). Pressure was maintained for one week with the four layer bandage but fell to 10.4 (3.5) mm Hg at 24 hours with adhesive plaster bandaging. (b) After weekly bandaging with the four layer bandage 110 of 48 venous ulcers had healed completely within 12 (mean 6.3 (0.4)) weeks. CONCLUSION--Sustained compression of over 40 mm Hg achieved with a multilayer bandage results in rapid healing of chronic venous ulcers that have failed to heal in many months of compression at lower pressures with more conventional bandages.\r"

  ".W": "Case notes of 1113 consecutive new patients referred to a consultant ophthalmologist at a district general hospital were reviewed to determine the source and efficacy of referrals and the current screening practices of general practitioners and ophthalmic opticians. General practitioners initiated referral in 546 cases (49%) and ophthalmic opticians referral in 439 (39%). Visual loss or visual disturbance was the most important single reason for referral (345 cases; 31%), followed by suspected glaucoma (145 cases; 13%), abnormalities of binocular vision (140; 12.5%), disorders of eyelids or ocular adnexa (127; 11%), and red eye (86; 8%). General practitioners referred many more patients with disorders of the eyelids and adnexa and ophthalmic opticians many more patients with suspected glaucoma. Ophthalmic opticians were far more likely than general practitioners to refer patients with suspected glaucoma correctly. A total of 180 patients (16%) were referred from ocular screening, in 149 cases by ophthalmic opticians and in 10 by general practitioners. Seventy patients had glaucoma or incomplete features of glaucoma, all of them referred by ophthalmic opticians. Of eight diabetic patients referred by ophthalmic opticians, three had asymptomatic disease and in two diabetes was diagnosed as a result of ocular screening. No patient was referred for asymptomatic diabetic retinopathy from screening by general practitioners. Ophthalmic opticians were more likely than general practitioners to diagnose retinopathy requiring photocoagulation. Use of a community based service to screen for glaucoma could save unnecessary consultant outpatient appointments. A similar service could facilitate detection of diabetic retinopathy at a stage when treatment is most effective.\r"

DESIGN--Non-randomised case series with 28 patients interviewed after two years and all followed up. SETTING--Secondary care referral centre. PATIENTS--153 women, aged less than 65, with T1, T2, N1, and N0 tumours of the breast given the choice of treatment (that is, all eligible patients from December 1979). INTERVENTIONS--Patients were asked, after information and counselling, which treatment they would prefer. The chosen treatment was given without further question. Mastectomy included node sampling and local radiotherapy if indicated. Conservation treatment comprised excision of the lump, external radiotherapy, and irridium wire implant to tumour bed. MAIN RESULTS--Conservation treatment was chosen by 54 women and mastectomy by 99. Reasons for preferring mastectomy included desire for rapid treatment for domestic or employment reasons and fear of possibility of future mastectomy. Only two of the sample interviewed regretted their choice. During limited follow up no advantages to either form of treatment were seen in terms of recurrence or survival. CONCLUSIONS--Patients with breast cancer are capable of choosing treatment and should play a part in deciding which treatment to have. They do not automatically choose to retain the breast.\r"

INTERVENTION--Patients saw one of two researchers once a week for six weeks. Controls were encouraged to talk about themselves; relaxation group was taught concentration on individual muscle groups; relaxation and imagery group was also taught to imagine peaceful scene of own choice to enhance relaxation. Relaxation and relaxation plus imagery groups were given tape recording repeating instructions and told to practise at least 15 minutes a day. END POINT--Improvement of mood and of depression and anxiety on self rating scales. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Initial scores for profile of mood states and Leeds general scales for depression and anxiety were the same in all groups. At six weeks total mood disturbance score was significantly less in the intervention groups, women in the combined intervention group being more relaxed than those receiving relaxation training only; mood in the control group was worse. Women aged 55 and over benefited most. There was no difference in Leeds scores among the groups. CONCLUSIONS--Patients with early breast cancer benefit from relaxation training.\r"

Two hundred and thirty four patients referred themselves to a casualty department during the study period, of whom 217 (93%) were interviewed by means of a semistructured questionnaire. Of the 217 patients interviewed, only 15 had tried to contact their general practitioner before attending the casualty department. Eighty nine patients considered that their problem was urgent and required immediate attention and many that they would need an x ray examination. A substantial minority of patients thought that their doctor would not be available. It is concluded that patients' perceptions of their problems and of access to their doctors are the main determinants of self referral to a casualty department. These findings have important implications for patient education.\r"

The adviser selected nurses to run these clinics and taught them the skills required to do so. She also carried her own caseload. One hundred and one patients were seen in the clinics in the first year, of whom 30 were cured. In a further one third continence was greatly improved, and the remainder benefited from advice and consultation. The adviser has worked in only six health centres but has had a greater impact on dealing with incontinence than a series of lectures and seminars for district nurses over many years had had.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects on fetal and maternal morbidity of routine active management of third stage of labour and expectant (physiological) management, in particular to determine whether active management reduced incidence of postpartum haemorrhage. DESIGN--Randomised trial of active versus physiological management. Women entered trial on admission to labour ward with allocation revealed just before vaginal delivery. Five months into trial high rate of postpartum haemorrhage in physiological group (16.5% v 3.8%) prompted modification of protocol to exclude more women and allow those allocated to physiological group who needed some active management to be switched to fully active management. Sample size of 3900 was planned, but even after protocol modification a planned interim analysis after first 1500 deliveries showed continuing high postpartum haemorrhage rate in physiological group and study was stopped. SETTING--Maternity hospital. PARTICIPANTS--Of 4709 women delivered from 1 January 1986 to 31 January 1987, 1695 were admitted to trial and allocated randomly to physiological (849) or active (846) management. Reasons for exclusion were: refusal, antepartum haemorrhage, cardiac disease, breech presentation, multiple pregnancy, intrauterine death, and, after May 1986, ritodrine given two hours before delivery, anticoagulant treatment, and any condition needing a particular management of third stage. INTERVENTIONS--All but six women allocated to active management actually received it, having prophylactic oxytocic, cord clamping before placental delivery, and cord traction; whereas just under half those allocated to physiological management achieved it. A fifth of physiological group received prophylactic oxytocic, two fifths underwent cord traction and just over half clamping of the cord before placental delivery. ENDPOINT--Reduction in incidence of postpartum haemorrhage from 7.5% under physiological management to 5.0% under active management. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Incidence of postpartum haemorrhage was 5.9% in active management group and 17.9% in physiological group (odds ratio 3.13; 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.2), a contrast reflected in other indices of blood loss. In physiological group third stage was longer (median 15 min v 5 min) and more women needed therapeutic oxytocics (29.7% v 6.4%). Apgar scores at one and five minutes and incidence of neonatal respiratory problems were not significantly different between groups. Babies in physiological group weighed mean of 85 g more than those in active group. When women allocated to and receiving active management (840) were compared with those who actually received physiological management (403) active management still produced lower rate of postpartum haemorrhage (odds ratio 2.4;95% CI1.6 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS--Policy of active management practised in this trial reduces incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, shortens third stage, and results in reduced neonatal packed cell volume.\r"

  ".W": "In the first three years of a surveillance scheme for susceptibility to rubella in women aged 15-44 the results of over 1.3 million serological tests were collected by 80 laboratories throughout the United Kingdom. Seventy eight per cent of the results, or an average of 340,000 a year, were from pregnant women, so that just under half of all pregnant women in the United Kingdom were reported on. Eighteen per cent of results were from women tested before vaccination and the remainder were from diagnostic and other tests. Pregnant women showed an overall downward trend in susceptibility to rubella (from 4.2% at the beginning of 1984 to 3.0% at the end of 1986), and a similar decline was seen in the two other categories. Regional data showed a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pregnant women aged 15-19 who were susceptible to the virus and rate of uptake of vaccine in 14 year old schoolgirls. Women aged 25-29 were least susceptible. This form of laboratory surveillance is feasible and representative; it should be continued to monitor the effect of introducing the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.\r"

  ".W": "There has been considerable debate over whether asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycaemia results in neurological damage. In a detailed multicentre study of 661 preterm infants hypoglycaemia was found to be common. Moderate hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose concentration less than 2.6 mmol/l) occurred in 433 of the infants and in 104 was found on three to 30 separate days. There was considerable variation among the centres, implying differences in decisions to intervene. The number of days on which moderate hypoglycaemia occurred was strongly related to reduced mental and motor development scores at 18 months (corrected age), even after adjustment for a wide range of factors known to influence development. When hypoglycaemia was recorded on five or more separate days adjusted mental and motor developmental scores at 18 months (corrected age) were significantly reduced by 14 and 13 points respectively, and the incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment (cerebral palsy or developmental delay) was increased by a factor of 3.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 9.4). These data suggest that, contrary to general belief, moderate hypoglycaemia may have serious neurodevelopmental consequences, and reappraisal of current management is urgently required.\r"

Conception was not influenced by the number of donors or patients attending the clinic, the frequency of inseminations, or medical skill. Conception was more common from early winter until early spring (October to March) with a peak in November. As variables such as frequency of intercourse and ovulation were irrelevant in these women and highest sperm counts occur from February to March these results suggested a seasonal variation in the quality of the ovulated egg or endometrial receptivity. The waste of eggs after ovulation (or preimplantation conceptuses) at specific times of the year has implications in the treatment of infertility, particularly for in vitro fertilisation and gamete intrafallopian transfer.\r"

The intake of analgesics in 230 patients with bleeding ulcers aged 60 and over and in hospital and community controls matched for age and sex was examined. Those who had taken aspirin were between two and three times more likely to be admitted to hospital with bleeding ulcers. This increased risk was not accounted for by aspirin taken for indigestion or by concurrent use of non-aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A similar effect was not seen for paracetamol. When aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were considered together the overall risk attributed to the drugs suggested that these drugs may be responsible for over a third of admissions for bleeding peptic ulcers in the elderly.\r"

Women aged 20-64 were identified from the computerised age-sex register. Only 16% of these women had had a smear test. A total of 750 call letters was sent out. Initially the response was poor (57 women; 22%), and 85 (32%) letters were returned marked \"address unknown.\" After the age-sex register was updated the response to call was 330 women (44%). The response of women aged over 35 was better than the response of women aged 35 and under (229 (53%) v 101 (32%)). In the year of the study the number of women aged 20-64 on the revised register who had been screened rose by 330 (14%). A general practice based call system can improve uptake of cervical screening even in a highly mobile, socially underprivileged population.\r"

Forty nine patients under 65 years of age with lung cancer each were matched for age and sex with two control subjects who attended the same general practice. Data were collected on social class, cigarette smoking, intake of beta carotene and vitamin C, and alcohol consumption. It was found that smoking, birdkeeping, and a low intake of vitamin C were significantly and independently related to the incidence of lung cancer. The odds ratio for lung cancer among people who keep birds as pets was estimated to be 6.7 after adjusting for smoking and vitamin C intake. The results of this study suggest that keeping pet birds is an independent risk factor for lung cancer.\r"

Patients with SLE showed a significantly reduced resting level of plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) compared to normal. The reduction in t-PA was demonstrated both by a functional assay (fibrin-plate lysis, FP) and an immunochemical assay (ELISA). Measurement of the fibrinolytic response following venous occlusion allowed division of the patients into two groups. In the first (24 patients), there was a normal increase in t-PA response, demonstrated both by the functional and immunochemical assays. In the second (10 patients), there was a significantly reduced plasma t-PA response measured by FP. Seven of the patients in this second group, which included four patients with histological evidence of vasculitis, showed a similar failure of t-PA response (ELISA) after venous occlusion. These results suggest that their impaired fibrinolytic response may be related to defective t-PA release secondary to endothelial cell damage. The remaining three patients in the latter group had a normal t-PA (ELISA) response despite a reduced FP response, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor.\r"

One patient showed biochemical features of progressive testicular failure. In the remaining patients, serum and derived free testosterone levels were significantly increased (p less than 0.01 respectively) and serum LH reduced (p less than 0.01). There were no changes, at this time, in prolactin, cortisol or androstenedione. Rheumatoid flares appear to be associated with prolonged suppression of testicular function.\r"

The narcotics were given in a double-blind fashion and all anaesthetic techniques were assigned randomly. Cardiorespiratory parameters remained stable in all groups, with few clinically important changes occurring. Recovery was significantly faster in the group receiving alfentanil, with the time to respond to verbal commands and the time to establish alertness significantly faster than with either fentanyl or enflurane. All techniques provided satisfactory anaesthesia; however, the patients receiving alfentanil had significantly more adverse events than those receiving fentanyl.\r"

The FGF requirement was 500 ml.kg-1.min-1 to maintain a PETCO2 of 30 mmHg and 250 ml.kg-1.min-1 to maintain a PETCO2 of 38 mmHg when minute ventilation greater than or equal to FGF. When these formulae were used in a subsequent group of similar patients, a wide variation in PETCO2 measurements were obtained. We conclude that the safest and most accurate approach to determine the FGF requirement of paediatric patients is to continuously monitor the PETCO2 in each patient and to adjust the FGF accordingly.\r"

Group 1 (n = 14) received 0.3 mg.kg-1 nalbuphine intravenously six hours after the epidural morphine administration. Group 2 (n = 6) received saline. Prior to agent administration, six patients from the nalbuphine group and four patients from the saline group had respiratory depression indicated by a PaCO2 greater than 45 mmHg. After nalbuphine administration the PaCO2 (mean +/- SE) decreased from 49.5 +/- 1.2 mmHg to 42.5 +/- 0.7 mmHg (p less than 0.005) while there was no significant change after saline administration. Nine of the 14 patients receiving nalbuphine appeared to become more sedated, despite an improvement in ventilation. Pruritus was antagonized by 0.1 mg.kg-1 nalbuphine (p less than 0.006). There was no reversal of analgesia after administration of 0.3 mg.kg-1 nalbuphine.\r"

Ovarian stimulation by menotropins was preceded by induction of hypopituitary hypogonadism using D-Trp6-LH-RH microcapsules. The OHSS cycles are characterized by improved ovarian response expressed by the increased serum levels of estradiol, number of follicles, oocytes, embryos and pregnancy rate as compared to cycles with no OHSS. All patients recovered uneventfully. The follicular puncture did not have the suggested protective effect against OHSS. It is suggested that the substantial incidence of OHSS is probably related to the excessive ovarian stimulation not interrupted by early luteinization which is practically abolished by this protocol. The role of the given luteal hCG doses in the genesis of OHSS is questioned.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) to cause an initial stimulation of serum gonadotropins was used for follicular recruitment for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 12 patients with a history of low estradiol (E2) response to conventional gonadotropin stimulation. Stimulation was initiated on cycle day 3 with concurrent administration of leuprolide (1 mg/day subcutaneously) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH, 4 ampules/day intramuscularly). An 8-fold increase in basal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and a 4-fold increase in basal serum FSH was seen on cycle day 4. Serum progesterone levels rose significantly by day 6. When compared to prior IVF attempts in these patients, the mean day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration and corresponding E2 levels were not significantly different. More atretic oocytes and fewer preovulatory oocytes were retrieved using GnRHa, and no increase was seen in total oocytes retrieved. One patient was canceled for poor E2 response, and one patient conceived, with a current viable pregnancy. It is concluded that concurrent initiation of leuprolide and FSH stimulation on cycle day 3 in patients with prior low response does not improve oocyte recruitment, and the high LH environment generated from initial stimulation of the agonist may be detrimental to normal oocyte development.\r"

Seven patients produced sperm during human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment given for 6 to 14 months. However, full spermatogenesis was achieved only when human menopausal gonadotropin was added to hCG regimen. In one patient, despite cessation of gonadotropin treatment, sexual potency, libido, and spermatogenetic capacity were maintained during the past 2 1/2 years. Our study indicates that it is possible to induce or to restore spermatogenesis in the majority of thalassemic patients and that gonadotrope cells may not be irreversibly damaged by iron deposition.\r"

The preparation was calibrated by radioimmunoassay, radioreceptor binding assay, and bioassay and was shown to have satisfactory stability and biological activity. Estimates of the ANF content of a set of specimens of plasma in terms of the standard showed agreement in ranking order when the ANF was extracted prior to assay. However, estimates of the ANF content of the plasmas in terms of either the international standard or the various local standards varied widely among laboratories. On the basis of the results reported here, with the agreement of the participants in the study and with the authorization of the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization of the World Health Organization, the preparation coded 85/669 was established in 1987 as the international standard for ANF, with a defined potency of 2.5 international units per ampoule.\r"

The distinction, as predicted by experimental models, is that solute removal is lower but constant in the former, and higher but variable with the quantity of filtrate in the latter. Moreover, unpredictable plugging reduces permeability during operation. It is therefore unclear which configuration is preferable in clinical use. In four cryo- and three macroglobulinemic patients, the data of 10 dead-end CF (QP) and 11 modified single-pass CF with high flow rate recycling plasma (QD) were compared. Both groups had similar starting values. Centrifugal primary plasma separation was performed. No exogenous reinfusions were used. Either 0.8 and 1.2 sq.m. surface secondary filters were employed. The ratio of plasma processed to patients' plasma volume was 1.1 +/- 0.3 in QP, and 0.94 +/- 0.09 in QD. The mean percentage removals of albumin, IgG and IgM respectively were 25.8 +/- 9, 32 +/- 17 and 47.5 +/- 26% in QP, 30.5 +/- 12, 40.5 +/- 19 and 48 +/- 17.5% in QD: albumin vs IgM p less than 0.025 in QP and p less than 0.02 in QD. A/G ratio increased from 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.06 +/- 0.6 in QP, and from 1.5 +/- 0.3 to 1.7 +/- 0.3 in QD. Plugging occurred in both groups, requiring 2.3 +/- 1.8 washouts/run in QP vs 1.5 +/- 1.2 in QD. IgM removal was comparable. Removal of albumin and IgG was slightly higher in QD. Similar performances can be obtained with either technique in clinical use, provided an adequate fractionation surface is available.\r"

Before the first terfenadine dose on day 0, and 12 hours after the evening terfenadine dose every seventh day and on randomly selected \"unscheduled\" days, wheal-and-flare areas were measured after intradermal injections of 0.01 ml of histamine phosphate (1.0 mg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml). On days 0, 28, and 56, six volunteers had skin tests hourly for 12 hours after the morning terfenadine dose. On all study days, serum terfenadine metabolite I concentrations were measured each time histamine skin tests were performed. On days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56, the mean areas of the histamine-induced wheals did not differ significantly from each other but were significantly decreased compared to the mean wheal area on day 0 (p less than 0.01). On these days, the mean areas of the histamine-induced flares also did not differ significantly from each other but remained significantly suppressed compared to the mean flare areas on day 0 (p less than 0.01). Wheal-and-flare suppression was noted in all unscheduled histamine skin tests performed 12 hours after the evening terfenadine dose. In the subgroup of volunteers who had hourly tests, on day 0, the mean wheal-and-flare areas were significantly suppressed from 2 to 12 hours after the dose, with maximal wheal suppression occurring at 5 hours (p less than 0.05) and maximal flare suppression occurring from 3 to 9 hours (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The stability of plasma lipids and apolipoproteins during the early postmortem period was studied by taking four duplicate blood samples from eight cadavers 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after death. The bodies were kept at +4 degrees C. The plasma samples were analyzed for total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). In TC, values rose by 6 and 11% in two cases, and in six cases diminished 3 to 15% during the first 6 h compared to values obtained 2 h postmortem. The greatest changes were a continuing rise in one case by 33% and a fall by 21% in another case during 24 h. In TG values marked changes took place including one case with a rise of 67% within 24 h. The concentrations of apo B rose by 9 to 11% in three cases and fell by 3 and 4% in two cases during 6 h, but during the whole study period a rise up to 78% occurred. In the concentrations of apo A-I, cases fell by as much as 42% in 6 h, and in one case rose by 20% during 6 h. The results indicate that unpredictable fluctuations occur in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein values within 24 h after death, and they should be interpreted cautiously if the samples have been taken after a prolonged postmortem period.\r"

Pretreatment with 4 mumol/kg of 1-NP shifted the entire dose-response curve for head-twitching induced by quipazine (0.33-46.7 mumol/kg i.p.) to the right without reducing locomotor stimulation produced by quipazine (8 mumol/kg) in mice placed in novel photocell cages. 1-NP, PAPP, TFMPP and mCPP (8 mumol/kg) antagonized twitching after 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (100 mumol/kg i.p.) or 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan. In rats, these arylpiperazines (1-32 mumol/kg) dose-dependently antagonized twitching elicited by quipazine (10 mumol/kg) without producing correlated alterations in locomotion. 1-NP, PAPP, and mCPP were equipotent and 6-fold more potent than TFMPP against twitching. None of these arylpiperazines caused twitching. 1-NP (4 mumol/kg) also antagonized twitching following the direct 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (6 mumol/kg i.p.) but not after the thyrotropin releasing hormone analog MK-771 (20 mumol/kg i.p.) in rats. Larger doses of 1-NP (4-32 mumol/kg) and PAPP (64 mumol/kg) but not TFMPP or mCPP (16-128 mumol/kg), also reduced the incidence of the 5-HT syndrome produced by 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (30 mumol/kg) in rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All results were expressed in terms of brain concentrations. A purely additive anticonvulsant interaction was found. However, due to a less than additive neurotoxic interaction, the combination had a better efficacy vs. toxicity score than either drug alone. These results, although not representative for all drug combinations, provide evidence that the dissociation between the anticonvulsant and the neurotoxic interaction of two antiepileptic drugs can result in a better protective index for certain combinations of antiepileptic drugs.\r"

Microsomes were prepared from outdated human platelets and incubated with arachidonic acid to produce thromboxane A2. The incubate was added to isolated, electrically stimulated rabbit portal veins to determine its effect on adrenergic neurotransmission. Immunoreactive thromboxane B2 concentrations were measured to assess the generation of the precursor, thromboxane A2. Addition of microsomes in the presence of arachidonic acid (1 microM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in thromboxane B2 concentrations, electrically induced force and norepinephrine release. Inclusion of acetylsalicylic acid (10 microM) or the thromboxane synthase inhibitor, U63557A (100 micrograms/ml), in the arachidonic acid-microsome incubate eliminated the potentiation of force, norepinephrine release and thromboxane B2 generation. The thromboxane receptor antagonist, SQ30741 (1 microM), also eliminated the microsome effects on neurogenic force and norepinephrine release but not on thromboxane generation. The microsome-arachidonic acid incubate did not influence norepinephrine concentration-contractile response curves. These data are consistent with a potentiative action of thromboxane A2 on adrenergic neurotransmission, primarily mediated by enhanced release of norepinephrine. The physiological or pathological significance of this observation depends on the thromboxane concentrations in the vicinity of adrenergic nerves.\r"

At 0 degrees C, [3H] LTB4 binding reached equilibrium within 30 min, and addition of a large excess of unlabeled LTB4 resulted in a rapid decrease of specific binding. Binding was saturable, reversible and dependent upon the number of lung macrophages. The KD and Bmax were found to be 3.85 +/- 0.6 nM and 35 +/- 3 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively, as determined from Scatchard analysis. In competition studies for the displacement of [3H]LTB4 from binding sites, LTB4 and its analogs had the following order of potency: LTB4 (Ki = 2.9 +/- 0.8 nM) greater than 5-epi LTB4 (Ki = 58.7 +/- 0.3 nM) greater than 5-deoxy-LTB4 (Ki = 91.7 +/- 0.3 nM) greater than 12-epi LTB4 (Ki = 4.7 +/- 1.2 microM) greater than 5,12-deoxy LTB4 (Ki = 7.6 +/- 0.01 microM) greater than or equal to 12-deoxy LTB4 (Ki = 8.9 +/- 0.01 microM). LTC4 and LTD4 did not displace the [3H] LTB4 binding at concentrations up to 10 microM. [3H]LTB4 was not metabolized during the binding process as determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. It was suggested that this binding site might be an LTB4 receptor.\r"

The equilibrium saturation binding of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 could be well described by a simple 1:1 binding scheme under all conditions tested. The results demonstrated that the effect of depolarization induced by high extracellular K+ (50 mM) compared to normal K+ (4.8 mM) was an increase in the observed number of binding sites (Bmax) with no change in the measured affinity of binding (Kd). Similarly, depolarization induced by a combination of Na channel toxins in the presence of normal extracellular K+ caused an increase in the observed binding of (+)-[3H]PN200-110 comparable to that observed with high K+. [3H]Nitrendipine binding was likewise increased by depolarization in the presence of 50 mM K+ compared to 4.8 mM K+. Percoll density gradient centrifugation was found to enrich the cell preparation with viable myocytes and increased the measured voltage-dependent change in binding. In agreement with the predictions from previous studies (Kamp and Miller, 1987a), the magnitude of the observed change in Bmax was directly related to the fraction of cells which were viable in a given experiment. These results are discussed in comparison to the modulated receptor hypothesis proposed from electrophysiological studies.\r"

EDRF was released by the calcium ionophore A23187 from cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelium (BPAE) grown on microcarrier beads and then superfused in a cell column. The maximum relaxations induced by EDRF (83%) or NO (79%) on phenylephrine (PE)-contracted rabbit aorta were similar. In contrast, EDRF was only half as potent as NO in relaxing the KCl-contracted rabbit aorta. EDRF induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of both PE-contracted rabbit aorta and histamine-contracted guinea pig aorta that was accompanied by a marked elevation in cyclic GMP levels. However, EDRF was vascular selective and did not relax or increase cyclic GMP levels of the histamine-contracted taenia coli of either species. NO was not vascular selective and relaxed both aorta and taenia coli and also markedly increased cyclic GMP levels in each. NO also relaxed dog femoral artery and gastrointestinal smooth muscle preparation of the lower esophageal sphincter, whereas EDRF only relaxed the femoral artery. Experiments were also performed describing the actions of a series of different resins: anion exchange resins (NH2/NH, AG-1), cation exchange resin (-COOH), reversed phase resin (C18) and hemoglobin-agarose on EDRF- or NO-induced relaxation. NH2/NH, AG-1 and hemoglobin-agarose resins inhibited EDRF-induced relaxation, but -COOH and C18 did not. The inhibition was dependent on the amount of resin employed. NO-induced relaxation was blocked only by hemoglobin-agarose but by none of the other resins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A series of experiments examined the effects of systemic administration of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol on the enhanced conditioned fear and the locomotor hyperactivity induced by central administration of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). In Experiment 1, CRF (0.5 microgram) was shown to reduce responding in both the conditioned stimulus (cs) and the pre-cs components of an on-the-base-line conditioned suppression schedule. The effects of CRF on cs, but not pre-cs responding were antagonized by propranolol, at doses (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) that did not affect responding themselves. This reversal of the anxiogenic effects of CRF by propranolol was specific to l- and not d-propranolol, showing that it did not result from nonspecific membrane stabilization. Propranolol also failed to reverse the reduced responding induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 in this schedule. In Experiment 2, propranolol was shown to potentiate the locomotor hyperactivity induced by CRF in a familiar photocell cage. These results suggest that activation of beta adrenoceptors may be an important mechanism in the behavioral inhibition induced by CRF, and that the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie the \"anxiogenic\" and the \"activating\" behavioral effects of CRF are neuropharmacologically distinct.\r"

The subtypes of alpha adrenoceptors found in isolated human saphenous vein were determined using selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Prazosin, a selective alpha-1 antagonist, produced a parallel shift of the concentration response curve to phenylephrine, a selective alpha-1 agonist, with no significant reduction in the maximal response. Yohimbine, a selective alpha-2 antagonist, produced a parallel shift of the concentration response curve to B-HT 920, a selective alpha-2 agonist, with no reduction in the maximal response. The pA2 values obtained for prazosin and yohimbine in human saphenous vein agreed closely with corresponding values obtained in canine saphenous vein. These results demonstrate that both alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors exist in human saphenous vein. Phenoxybenzamine (10(-7) M), an irreversible alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, markedly reduced the maximal response produced by phenylephrine, an agonist with high intrinsic activity, with no significant shift in the concentration response curve in human saphenous vein, suggesting that there was little or no alpha-1 receptor reserve for phenylephrine. The sensitivity of alpha-1 versus alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to nitroglycerin were compared in human and canine saphenous veins. In both species, nitroglycerin blocked the vasoconstrictor response produced by stimulation of alpha-2 adrenoceptors to the same degree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Despite an absence of experimental evidence, many clinicians administer epinephrine with calcium to augment its cardiovascular effects. We evaluated the effects of calcium on epinephrine's pressor response in both normal and endotoxin-treated rats by administering epinephrine to animals made hypercalcemic with calcium chloride or hypocalcemic with the calcium chelator EGTA. EPI, given in incremental doses of 10, 20 and 50 micrograms/kg, produced incremental increases in mean arterial pressure. Calcium chloride infused i.v. at a rate of 50 mg/ml/hr significantly (P less than .05) blunted (50% decrease) the hypertensive response to 50 micrograms/kg epinephrine in normal animals. In endotoxin-treated rats, calcium chloride at 50 mg/ml/hr significantly blunted the hypertensive response to 10 micrograms/kg (73% decrease), 20 micrograms/kg (62% decrease) and 50 micrograms/kg (50% decrease) epinephrine. Endotoxemia plus calcium chloride at 25 mg/ml/hr also significantly blunted (30% decrease) the hypertensive response to 50 micrograms/kg EPI. By contrast, hypocalcemia produced by EGTA (30 mg/ml/hr) had no effect on epinephrine's hypertensive effects in normal or endotoxemic rats. Since calcium chloride significantly diminishes epinephrine's hypertensive effects in both normal and endotoxin-treated rats, the clinical use of calcium chloride along with epinephrine may not have a sound experimental basis.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral sympathetic neurons are thought to provide trophic regulatory signals for development of adrenergic target tissues. In the current study, we destroyed central catecholaminergic pathways in the neonatal rat by intracisternal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine, which compromises sympathetic tone without ablating peripheral nerve terminals. Measurements of norepinephrine levels and turnover confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment in projections to heart, lung and kidney. The impairment of sympathetic tone was associated with a deficit in cardiac beta adrenergic receptor binding capabilities; in contrast, binding sites in the lung were unaffected and renal receptors were up-regulated. Similarly, intracisternal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine produced tissue-selective alterations in ornithine decarboxylase activity and levels of the polyamines. These results support the view that neural activity exerts an influence on the biochemical development of sympathetic target tissues; however, other trophic factors may derive from the presence of intact nerve terminals themselves, as distinct from activity.\r"

In addition to its activities in allergen-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs, Sch 37224 also inhibited hyperventilation-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs at 0.5 to 5 mg/kg and anaphylactic bronchospasm in rats at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Sch 37224 was weak or ineffective as an antagonist of histamine, methacholine, serotonin, LTC4 or platelet activating factor induced bronchospasms in guinea pigs. Also, Sch 37224 was not a bronchodilator or calcium influx blocker and had only weak relaxant activity on guinea pig trachea in vitro (IC40 = 51 microM). Sch 37224 is, therefore, a potential antiallergic agent that inhibits LT release. It is p.o. effective in animal models of allergic and nonallergic-mediated bronchospasms.\r"

Increased incidence of Scl-70 antibodies in scleroderma were found by the immunoblot method (55%) compared to the gel precipitation methods (40 or 42% depending on the test kits used). Immunoblot analysis of the antigen prepared with 4.0 M NaCl extraction of rabbit thymus acetone powder revealed antigen to be 100, 86, 80 and 70 kDa. However, mainly a single band of 70 kDa was obtained upon extraction of rabbit thymus with 0.3 M NaCl and of calf thymus antigen. Our data support the suggestion that different molecular species of the Scl-70 antigen have variable binding affinities to nuclear DNA. We suggest that the presence of various molecular forms of the antigen may be a result of this differential binding affinity to DNA and the partial proteolytic digestion of 100 kDa from the antigen as reported by others.\r"

  ".W": "Sexual differentiation in placental mammals results from the action of a testis-determining gene encoded by the Y chromosome. This gene causes the indifferent gonad to develop as a testis, thereby initiating a hormonal cascade which produces a male phenotype. Recently, a candidate for the testis-determining gene (ZFY, Y-borne zinc-finger protein) has been cloned. The ZFY probe detects a male-specific (Y-linked) sequence in DNA from a range of eutherian mammals, as well as an X-linked sequence (ZFX) which maps to the human X chromosome. In marsupials it is also the Y chromosome that seems to determine the fate of the gonad, but not all sexual dimorphisms. Using the ZFY probe we find, surprisingly, that the ZFY homologous sequences are not on either the X or the Y chromosome in marsupials, but map to the autosomes. This implies ZFY is not the primary sex-determining gene in marsupials. Either the genetic pathways of sex determination in marsupials and eutherians differ, or they are identical and ZFY is not the primary signal in human sex determination.\r"

A 2.2% flare-up incidence was found, with no statistically significant differences for penicillin (0.0%), base (2.9%), and stearate (3.8%). No hypersensitivity responses occurred, and gastrointestinal side effects were found primarily with the erythromycins (12.4%). To ascertain whether or not similar results would occur with student operators in a dental school clinic population, the current study was undertaken. One-hundred ninety-five patients with quiescent PN/PL were randomly given either penicillin V or erythromycin (base or stearate). A 2.6% flare-up incidence was found, with no statistically significant differences for penicillin (3.1%), base (1.5%), and stearate (3.1%). No hypersensitivity responses occurred, and GI side effects were found primarily with the erythromycins (17.7%). As can be seen, the results were very similar to those of the recent endodontic practice study. Hence, it can be concluded that the results of the previous endodontic practice study were not unique to any one clinician or method. A comparison was also made between the \"prophylactic\" penicillin group of the current study and the placebo control group of our previous dental school clinic, student operator study (in which the methods, population, and regimen were almost identical to those of the current study). The results showed that the \"prophylactic\" penicillin group had significant fewer flare-ups and non-flare-up-associated swelling and pain than did the placebo group. In view of these findings and those from studies from the literature in which \"prophylactic\" antibiotics were not used, it is our opinion that the antibiotic regimens used in the current study should be a component of clinical endodontic therapy for quiescent PN/PL.\r"

Twenty-six patients, who underwent surgery from 1985 to 1987 and who have been followed for more than 6 months, were examined using a conductive ESCP, which demonstrates lower extremity, bowel, and bladder function, and a segmental ESCP and dermatome segmental ESCP, which demonstrate upper extremity function. A five-pole recording electrode was placed in the cervical epidural space. The stimulation sites were the thoracic epidural space for conductive ESCP, the median nerve at the elbow for the segmental ESCP, and the finger surface for the dermatome segmental ESCP. In cases in which the ESCP disappeared at the middle of the narrow cervical spinal canal, another stimulating electrode was placed in the cisterna magna, and a descending conductive ESCP was recorded to monitor the upper border of the spinal lesion. New findings, which could not be observed by roentgenograms, myelography, and CT scan, were detectable using this technique.\r"

The procedure involves grinding the laminae down with an air drill and making a Z-shaped cut into the thinned laminae without excising the laminae. This technique enlarges the spinal canal. The purpose of this technique is to decompress the spinal cord and at the same time maintain clinical stability. Postoperative results were satisfactory without any major complication. Follow-up study was conducted in 78 cases with a minimal follow-up period of more than 2 years. Satisfactory clinical results were maintained for long periods postoperatively, and the enlargement of the spinal canal was well maintained as demonstrated on follow up X-ray study.\r"

The authors have described lumbar spinal stenosis due to OPLL or OYL as hyperostotic lumbar spinal stenosis, and analyzed 12 surgically documented cases with this condition. The symptoms and signs of hyperostotic lumbar spinal stenosis are the same as those seen in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, but the degree of paraparesis is much more severe in hyperostotic lumbar spinal stenosis. Computed tomography scan imaging clearly demonstrates OPLL or OYL in the lumbar spine, although some lesions can be seen on the lateral view of a plain roentgenogram. The results of 12 surgical cases suggest that decompression laminectomy produces relief of symptoms. An analysis of 2,403 plain lumbar roentgenograms showed an incidence of 8.4% OYL in the lumbar spine, with frequent involvement of the upper and middle lumbar spine. A classification system of OYL in the lumbar spine has been developed. The entire spine should be examined before surgery on a patient with hyperostotic lumbar spinal stenosis because of a tendency to ossify spinal ligaments at other levels.\r"

Of the 12 patients who had pulmonary rejection, nine recovered fully after augmented immunosuppression with high dose corticosteroids, although one patient required additional low dose corticosteroids for eight months before making a full recovery. Fatal opportunist lung infection followed treatment for rejection in two patients. One patient developed obliterative bronchiolitis. Of the eight patients with opportunist infections, five had primary cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, acquired from the donor. All three patients treated with acyclovir died, whereas the two treated with hyperimmune globulin and dihydroxy proxymethylguanine recovered fully. Two patients developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which was treated successfully in one patient with intravenous sulphadimidine and trimethoprim. The other patient died after a further episode of rejection and aspergillus bronchitis. One patient developed a tuberculous empyema. The calculated actuarial survival at one year was 78% and at two years 67.2%.

Twelve patients (60%) were completely free from AF and 11 of these are still successfully treated with flecainide after 11-38 months (mean 24 months). Flecainide plasma levels did not differ between responders and non-responders. Eleven patients (55%) had adverse effects but these were usually mild and well tolerated, necessitating withdrawal or dose reduction resulting in relapse of AF only in three patients (15%).

We previously demonstrated the presence of specific atrial natriuretic peptide receptors in human placental membranes. We asked whether atrial natriuretic peptide specific receptors are present in sheep cotyledons. Sheep cotyledons were obtained from pregnant ewes at 125 to 142 days' gestation. Each cotyledon was separated into two components, the outer layer (maternal capsule) and the spongy inner layer (fetal component). A microsomal plasma membrane fraction was prepared from each layer. Atrial natriuretic peptide receptors were detected by in vitro radioligand techniques with 125I-alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide. In sheep cotyledons there are two sets of atrial natriuretic peptide receptors that show either high-affinity/low-capacity or low-affinity/high-capacity binding characteristics. Moreover, membranes from the inner layer (fetal component) appear to have a lower concentration of high-affinity atrial natriuretic peptide binding sites than those from the maternal capsule.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the fetal autonomic nervous system modulates the fetal plasma atrial natriuretic factor and urine flow responses to vascular volume expansion. To do this, isotonic saline solution (2% of estimated body weight) was infused intravascularly over a 10-minute period into autonomically intact or autonomically blocked fetal sheep. The autonomically intact fetuses responded to the infusion with a significant rise in arterial and venous pressures (p less than 0.0001), and atrial natriuretic factor increased by 36 +/- 8 (SE) pg/ml (p less than 0.05). In the autonomically blocked fetuses, the arterial pressure rise was greater (7.5 +/- 1.3 vs 2.6 +/- 0.7 mm Hg), whereas the venous pressure rise was not different from that seen in the intact fetuses. Atrial natriuretic factor increased by 44 +/- 20 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) in the blocked fetuses. Urine flow increased by similar amounts in the two groups (maximal increase above control of 0.33 +/- 0.11 in the intact and 0.27 +/- 0.10 ml/min in the blocked fetuses). Thus autonomic blockade did not significantly alter either the atrial natriuretic factor, urine flow, or venous pressure responses to volume loading in the fetal sheep. Therefore it appears that the autonomic nervous system does not play a major role in modulating atrial natriuretic factor, urine flow, or venous pressure responses to acute vascular volume expansion in the late gestational fetal sheep.\r"

  ".W": "The fetal lung, a significant source of in utero fluid production, has been postulated to serve a regulatory role in maintenance of fetal body fluid homeostasis. Whereas the fetus responds to intravascular saline solution infusions with increased urine output, the fetal lung fluid response to this stimulus is unclear. Tracheal fluid output was measured in four chronically catheterized ovine fetuses (mean gestation, 129 +/- 1 days) subjected to successive 40-minute intravenous 0.9% saline solution infusions at rates of 0.5 and 1 ml/min/per kilogram of body weight. Tracheal fluid output decreased significantly (1.7 +/- 0.1 to 1.1 +/- 0.1 ml/10 min, p less than 0.01) during the infusion and returned to basal levels during the recovery period. Lung fluid osmolality and electrolyte concentration did not change. Fetal plasma atrial natriuretic factor increased significantly in response to the saline solution infusion (364 +/- 90 to 790 +/- 286 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) and returned to basal levels during the recovery period. There was a significant inverse correlation between plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels and tracheal fluid output. These results suggest that increased fetal plasma atrial natriuretic factor decreases lung fluid production. Lung fluid does not appear to compensate for fetal body water excess. Rather, lung fluid production appears to promote intrauterine pulmonary growth and to facilitate the transition to the extrauterine environment.\r"

  ".W": "We measured five hormones presumably involved in fetal homeostasis in specimens obtained by cordocentesis for clinical indications from 106 fetuses. Norms for atrial natriuretic factor, digoxin-like immunoreactive substance, plasma renin activity, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were derived from fetuses ultimately shown to be free of detectable abnormality. Atrial natriuretic factor, digoxin-like immunoreactive substance, and plasma renin activity were unrelated to umbilical vessel source or gestational age. Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance was directly related to PCO2 (r = 0.63, p = 0.02). Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance level was elevated in all fetal disease states studied except isoimmunization. The level of atrial natriuretic factor was elevated in fetuses with immune hydrops (NS). Norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were higher in the umbilical artery than in the vein (p = 0.05 and 0.006, respectively). There was a significant correlation between norepinephrine and gestational age in normal fetuses (r = 0.7637, p less than 0.025) and between both catecholamines and many of the respiratory blood gas measurements, with pH and PCO2 being the major determinants. Most disease states were associated with an elevated norepinephrine concentration. There was a negative correlation between plasma renin activity and base deficit (p less than 0.0001). Plasma renin activity was elevated in fetuses with idiopathic growth retardation and nonimmune hydrops (p less than 0.05 for each). In summary, fetal homeostasis as reflected by these five hormones was altered by a variety of disorders. With these baseline values the effects of direct or indirect fetal therapy can begin to be studied.\r"

  ".U": "89086498\r", 
  ".W": "The human fetal adrenal gland is primarily composed of fetal zone cells, which exhibit a high rate of steroidogenesis and a rapid growth rate during fetal life. alpha-Human atrial natriuretic polypeptide has been shown to inhibit basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis in the human adult and in some human adrenal adenoma cells. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of atrial natriuretic polypeptide on steroidogenesis by fetal zone cells. Dispersed fetal zone cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer's medium with adrenocorticotropic hormone, forskolin, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate and in the presence of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. The medium was analyzed for content of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol by radioimmunoassay. The addition of adrenocorticotropic hormone, forskolin, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate increased the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol twofold to threefold and twofold to sixfold, respectively, above basal rates. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide significantly inhibited basal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and cortisol secretion. When cells were incubated in the presence of adrenocorticotropic hormone, forskolin, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate plus atrial natriuretic polypeptide, cortisol secretion was inhibited 50% to 90% and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was inhibited 25% to 50%. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide had no effect on the metabolism of progesterone tagged with carbon 14 in fetal zone cells. In conclusion, atrial natriuretic polypeptide inhibited basal and adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated steroid secretion by fetal zone cells. Furthermore, these results suggested that the action of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was by inhibition of cholesterol side-chain cleavage or transfer of cholesterol to the mitochondrion.\r"

  ".U": "89086499\r", 
  ".W": "Myometrial smooth muscle cells in culture were incubated for 18 hours in medium that contained serum (10%); under these conditions, there was a six to 26-fold increase in the amount of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha that accumulated in the medium (i.e., prostacyclin production) compared with that present after incubation in serum-free medium. In serum-free and serum-containing media, treatment of these cells with dexamethasone (10(-8) mol/L) or cortisol (10(-7) mol/L) suppressed the biosynthesis of prostacyclin by approximately 80% and 64%, respectively. Arachidonic acid (bound to fatty acid-free human serum albumin) added to serum-free medium caused a concentration-dependent increase in the production of prostacyclin by myometrial cells. Arachidonic acid was maximally effective at a concentration of 10(-5) mol/L and caused a five- to 28-fold increase in the biosynthesis and secretion of prostacyclin. Linoleic acid (bound to albumin) in serum-free medium also caused a concentration-dependent increase in the production of prostacyclin; however, the amount of prostacyclin produced in the presence of linoleic acid was lower than that produced in the presence of an equimolar concentration of arachidonic acid. In the presence of arachidonic (10(-5) mol/L) or linoleic acids (10(-4) mol/L) in serum-free medium, the addition of dexamethasone (10(-8) mol/L) or cortisol (10(-7) mol/L) suppressed but did not inhibit completely prostacyclin production. These findings are indicative that arachidonic and linoleic acids in the culture medium support prostacyclin biosynthesis by human myometrial smooth muscle cells. The inhibition of prostacyclin production by glucocorticosteroids in the absence or presence of extracellular arachidonic (or linoleic) acid may be caused by inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity.\r"

In all experimental conditions the yolk sacs had greater fatty acid content than the embryos in all lipid groups except in nonesterified fatty acids. The fatty acid level in embryonic nonesterified fatty acids was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in hyperglycemia-exposed embryos than found with arachidonic acid supplementation. Total yolk sac triglycerides were greater with added glucose (p less than 0.05) than with the addition of arachidonic acid to the same medium. Oleic acid, a fatty acid associated with essential fatty acid deficiency, was increased in the embryonic phospholipids and nonesterified fatty acids of conceptuses exposed to excess glucose, as well as in the culture media of this group, compared with the control or arachidonic acid-supplemented, hyperglycemic group (p less than 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that diabetes-related embryopathy is associated with quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in major lipid groups. Furthermore, the elevation in embryonic oleic acid level suggests that the teratogenic mechanism could be related to a deficiency in essential fatty acids. The pattern of essential fatty acid deficiency and embryopathy was preventable with arachidonic acid supplementation in this experimental model.\r"

However, CA 125 levels were not significantly elevated in women with stage I (16.6 +/- 2.0 U/ml, n = 28) or stage II endometriosis (17.9 +/- 2.1 U/ml, n = 13). Peritoneal fluid levels of CA 125 (n = 14) were significantly higher (2 to 9.3 times) than the corresponding paired plasma levels in participants with stage I, II, or III endometriosis. In patients treated with danazol (n = 10) or buserelin (n = 17), plasma CA 125 levels decreased significantly by midtherapy, remained suppressed at the end of therapy, but rebounded to near pretreatment levels 6 months after treatment was completed. With gestrinone therapy a similar decline was observed but became significant only at the end of therapy. Our findings indicate that elevated plasma CA 125 levels may prove useful in the management of endometriosis.\r"

Twenty postmenopausal women were randomized to receive either two 25 mg estradiol pellets subdermally (n = 10) or a 0.1 mg estradiol transdermal patch twice weekly (n = 10). Blood was sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 72 hours and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks (fasting samples at 0, 12, and 24 weeks), and a fasting urine was obtained after diuresis at 0, 12, and 24 weeks. In a 72-hour profile, serum estradiol levels (mean +/- SE) were highest at 24 hours (179 +/- 20 pg/ml) and fell to 139 +/- 16 pg/ml at 72 hours in the pellet group. In the patch group, estradiol levels rose rapidly to 152 +/- 33 pg/ml at 4 hours, remained relatively constant over 8 hours, and fell to 46 +/- 10 pg/ml at 72 hours. At 1 week, estradiol levels in the pellet group were 113 +/- 12 pg/ml and remained relatively constant for 24 weeks. In contrast, estradiol levels in the patch group were 52 +/- 11 pg/ml at 1 week and then varied widely until 24 weeks, when the levels were 89 +/- 26 pg/ml. The mean estradiol/estrone ratio ranged between 1 and 2.5 in both groups but fluctuated widely in the patch group. Follicle-stimulating hormone was suppressed in both groups; however, the decrement in the pellet group was greater (p less than 0.002). There was a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 weeks with the pellet but only at 24 weeks with the patch. The urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was reduced more consistently with the pellet than with the patch. Hot flushes were eliminated in all subjects.\r"

In a retrospective investigation, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure antibody titers to components of anthrax edema toxin (edema factor [EF] and protective antigen [PA]), lethal toxin (lethal factor [LF] and PA), and poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. Electrophoretic-immunotransblots (EITB, Western blot) were used to detect antibodies to PA and LF. Nine patients with cutaneous anthrax, 10 patients with oral-oropharyngeal anthrax, and 43 healthy unexposed Thai control villagers were studied. Over all, EITB was positive in 13/18 patients (sensitivity 72%) and 0/43 controls (specificity 100%). The sensitivity of the ELISA was 72% for PA, 42% for LF, 26% for EF, and 95-100% for capsule. Although a few control sera had apparent false positive titers to PA, the specificity of the ELISA confirmed by EITB (100%) demonstrated the applicability of these tests for the diagnosis of anthrax.\r"

Five of 13 multisystemic patients had decreased cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in extrafusal fibers, with sparing of intrafusal muscle fibers. In the myopathic form, pathological findings were similar to those in the multisystemic form. In addition to complex I and NADH dehydrogenase activities being decreased, the CCO activity was significantly decreased (less than 50% of control value) in 8 patients, especially when the disease was in its advanced stages, suggesting that CCO enzyme might be secondarily affected as the disease progresses.\r"

A common feature differentiating SIV and HIV-2 from HIV-1 is the size of the transmembrane portion of the envelope, which is smaller (gp32) in SIVmac and HIV-2 than in HIV-1 (gp41). The presence of this truncated form of the transmembrane glycoprotein in SIVmac and HIV-2 virions is apparently related to the presence of a translation termination codon in the env gene of all SIV proviruses analyzed as well as in one HIV-2 provirus. Since the carboxy terminus of the envelope transmembrane protein has been implicated in the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 in vitro, we decided to investigate whether putative expression of the open reading frame located after the termination codon correlates with the pathogenicity of SIVmac in vivo. We generated two synthetic peptides from the inferred amino acid sequence of SIVmac and tested their reactivity by Western blot against the sera of naturally and experimentally infected monkeys as well as against sera of HIV-2-infected individuals. Our results indicate that the protein synthesized from this open reading frame is expressed in vivo, since an immunoresponse can be detected against the synthetic peptides in two of three experimentally SIVmac-infected animals. However, no correlation can be found between its expression and disease progression at this time. Furthermore, a rabbit immune serum raised against the synthetic peptide failed to identify any specific protein in SIVmac-infected cells.\r"

A rise time of 80 ms (10-70%) is sufficient to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration with 5% accuracy in patients with rates of ventilation less than 100 b.p.m. and I:E ratios less than 2:1. We have measured the rise time of 11 commercially available carbon dioxide analysers and found that only six of the 11 responded quickly enough to be accurate for rates up to 100 b.p.m. All 11 responded rapidly enough to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration with 5% accuracy when ventilatory rates were less than 30 b.p.m. To measure VCO2 with 5% accuracy, an analyser should have a rise time of 20 ms. Only one analyser met this specification. An analyser's rise time can be estimated clinically to within 10 (SD 8) ms by a simple breath hold and forced exhalation, thus providing an estimate of the accuracy of carbon dioxide measurements in adults or children.\r"

Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was administered to both groups using a computer-controlled closed loop system which adjusted the infusion rate to maintain a preset target arterial pressure. Target pressure +/- 5, 10, 15 and 20 mm Hg was maintained longer in the group receiving alfentanil. This group also required less SNP per hour. No difference was noted between the groups in the time taken to regain spontaneous ventilation and to extubation of the trachea, although the alfentanil group tended to be sedated more deeply during the infusion. The main advantage of alfentanil over morphine at doses used in this study was its superior ability to attenuate hypertensive responses to noxious stimuli, providing improved haemodynamic stability.\r"

Children with cyanotic heart disease produced approximately 20% less carbon dioxide per unit body weight than acyanotic children, but ventilation was approximately 20% less efficient. Adequate ventilation should therefore be obtained when \"normal\" ventilation in relation to body weight is used in cyanotic children.\r"

The frequency of wound and pelvic infections was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05, chi 2- or Fisher's exact test) in the abdominal hysterectomy patients who received cephradine (16% vs 23% mezlocillin, 29% placebo) and in the vaginal hysterectomy patients who received cephradine or mezlocillin (0% mezlocillin, 6% cephradine vs 27% placebo). These results are similar to those of previous studies and suggest that prophylaxis is more effective for vaginal than for abdominal hysterectomy. However, a cost-benefit analysis supported the opposite conclusion. Cephradine prophylaxis for abdominal hysterectomy resulted in cost savings to the hospital and the community health services with measurable benefits to the patient. In contrast, cephradine or mezlocillin prophylaxis for vaginal hysterectomy resulted in increased costs to the hospital, no savings to community services and no significant benefit to the patient. We conclude that cost-benefit analysis provided valuable additional information to the conventional, statistical analysis of wound or pelvic infection rates.\r"

Wheeze in the past year was the symptom most closely associated with reported dampness and particularly with mould. The unadjusted odds ratio relating mould and wheeze was 3.70 (95% confidence interval 2.22 to 6.15), and after adjustment for housing tenure, number of people per room, number of smokers in the household, and gas cooking this remained highly significant (odds ratio 3.00 (1.72 to 5.25)). The reduction in forced expiratory volume in one second after six minutes of free running was used to validate reporting of wheeze. At all levels of measured bronchial lability wheeze was reported more commonly in the children from homes with mould. There was no significant difference in the degree of bronchospasm measured among children from homes with and without mould. Awareness of dampness or mould in the home may be a determinant of parental reporting of symptoms and may account for much of the observed association between mould and respiratory symptoms.\r"

These studies excluded subjects with overt ischaemia. More recently long term studies of hypertension that included patients with more severe forms of hypertension and did not exclude those with overt ischaemia have shown a J shaped relation between diastolic blood pressure during treatment and myocardial infarction; the lowest point (the J point) was at a diastolic blood pressure (phase V) between 85 and 90 mm Hg. The J curve seems to be independent of treatment, pulse pressure, and the degree of fall in diastolic blood pressure and is unlikely to be caused by poor left ventricular function. The most probable explanation is that subjects who have severe stenosis of the coronary artery as well as hypertension have a poor coronary flow reserve, which makes the myocardium vulnerable to coronary perfusion pressures that are tolerated by patients without ischaemia, particularly at high heart rates. An optimal diastolic blood pressure (phase V) for such patients is about 85 mm Hg, though particular caution is appropriate when treating very old patients (84 and over) and patients aged 60-79 who have isolated systolic hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "From 1971 to 1981, 98 babies born with meningomyelocoele at the North Staffordshire Hospital Centre's district maternity hospital, were thought not suitable for surgery. Sixty three survived for more than one week. Over the period the hospital's policy changed: initially all such babies were kept in hospital, but later parents were given the choice of taking their baby home for palliative and terminal care. In an attempt to determine parents' views on the care of their baby the parents of 44 of the babies who survived to one week were traced in 1985-6, five to 14 years later; 80 of them were asked how they felt about the lives and deaths of their babies. Eighteen babies had been taken home, and they had lived longer than the 26 who had been cared for in hospital. Parents whose baby had remained in hospital were sadder than those who had taken their baby home when they looked back at their experiences, and they also considered that their baby's life had been of poor quality. Most of those who had taken their baby home had a more positive view of their child's life. The figures suggest that the bereavement process after a baby's death is longer than has been thought, but despite residual sadness just over half of the parents interviewed thought that something positive had come out of their experience.\r"

These studies, however, have emphasised that the differences in outcome are small and may be explained by other factors. The analyses have taken account of birth weight and have therefore examined the effects of smoking on subsequent development in addition to this variable. To assess the importance of smoking on development in early adult life and whether the effect is independent of birth weight data from the 1958 cohort at age 23 were analysed. Only weak evidence for a relation between smoking in pregnancy and self reported height of the offspring was apparent once social class, size of family, mothers' height, and birth weight for gestational age were taken into account. After omission of birth weight from the analyses, however, the average difference in height between subjects whose mothers smoked 20 cigarettes a day or more during the second half of pregnancy and those whose mothers did not was 0.93 cm in men and 1.83 cm in women. A strong association was also evident with the highest qualification achieved by subjects at this age, suggesting a long term relation between smoking in pregnancy and the intellectual development of the offspring.\r"

DESIGN--Single blind randomised comparison of equimolar doses of 125I labelled soluble human insulin and insulin analogue. SETTING--Study in normal people at a diabetes research unit and a university department of medical physics. SUBJECTS--Seven healthy male volunteers aged 20-39 not receiving any other drugs. INTERVENTIONS--After an overnight fast and a basal period of one hour two doses (0.05 and 0.1 U/kg) of 125I labelled soluble human insulin and insulin analogue were injected subcutaneously into the anterior abdominal wall on four separate days. END POINT--To find a fast acting insulin for meal related requirements in insulin dependent diabetics. MEASUREMENTS and main results--Residual radioactivity at the injection site was measured continuously for the first two hours after injection of the 125I labelled preparations and thereafter for five minutes simultaneously with blood sampling. Frequent venous blood samples were obtained over six hours for determination of plasma immunoreactive insulin, insulin analogue, glucose, and glucagon values. Time to 50% of initial radioactivity at the injection site for the insulin analogue compared with soluble insulin was 61 v 135 minutes (p less than 0.05) with 0.05 U/kg and 67 v 145 minutes (p less than 0.001) with 0.1 U/kg. Concentrations in plasma increased faster after the insulin analogue compared with soluble insulin, resulting in higher plasma concentrations between 10 and 150 minutes (0.001 less than p less than 0.05) after 0.05 U/kg and between 40 and 360 minutes (0.001 less than p less than 0.05) after 0.1 U/kg. The hypoglycaemic response to insulin analogue was a plasma glucose nadir at 60 minutes with both doses compared with 90 and 120 minutes with soluble insulin at 0.5 and 0.1 U/kg respectively. The response of glucagon substantiated the earlier and more dramatic hypoglycaemic effect with the insulin analogue. CONCLUSIONS--The much faster absorption from subcutaneous tissue of the disubstituted monomeric insulin analogue compared with soluble insulin suggests that the analogue may be a potential candidate for rapid insulin delivery after subcutaneous bolus injection.\r"

Twenty weeks after the last referral had been made no communication had been received by the practice for 24% (61/252) of all referral letters received by the hospital. Minimum delays to appointments and improved communication between hospitals and general practitioners would help general practitioners to make appropriate referrals and improve compliance.\r"

The results of a national Delphi study among anaesthetists and general surgeons who were known to be in favour of day surgery produced estimates of the probable rates of day surgery for each of those operations under ideal conditions. Comparison of these figures with those from a Delphi study carried out in one district and with figures for day surgery carried out in that district and with waiting list figures enabled two health districts to focus their efforts to increase day surgery. The figures from the national Delphi study could be applied in other districts if the following are taken into account: Hospital Activity Analysis data must be validated; though there was consensus among the national Delphi consultants, personal clinical opinions varied; the case load may grow as waiting lists decrease.\r"

Adults with physical disabilities or mixed physical and psychological disabilities, including unstable or deteriorating conditions, were accepted for intensive rehabilitation. Most patients had neurological disorders. The ward policy was that each patient had considerable time with the therapist, maximum personal independence was encouraged, and multidisciplinary staff meetings were held to agree the goals of treatment. Much effort was spent helping patients and relatives to adapt to conditions of progressive disability, but the response to questionnaires suggested that these patients as well as those who did improve received some benefit from being on the ward. Overall the benefits of the intensive rehabilitation that was offered on this ward outweighed those from short stays on medical wards.\r"

Medical practitioners and the health authorities are alerted to this amplification of inaccurate data. Other methods for assessing trauma and orthopaedic surgery are proposed, such as a simplification of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys classification of surgical operations, grading operations based on time spent in the operating theatre, and provision of computer programs to code for diagnosis and operation when writing discharge summaries.\r"

It is shown that the effectiveness of the Clatterbridge beam was reduced with penetration into the phantom because of hardening of the beam to a maximum reduction of 11% at 12 cm deep in the phantom. The hardening of the beam with depth of penetration will need to be taken into account by clinicians in assessing the tumour dose and tissue tolerance. Relative biological effectiveness values for the Clatterbridge and Hammersmith neutron beams were also measured. All neutron doses for both Hammersmith and Clatterbridge beams are total doses (n + gamma) which comply with the European protocol for neutron dosimetry and include the gamma-ray component of dose.\r"

In all cases a temporary medical castration had been achieved during intensive chemotherapy by the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (500 mg daily per os). The hormone treatment was initiated on day 1 of the first chemotherapy cycle. Thirteen additional patients did not receive this hormone treatment but were treated by similar chemotherapy. The latter patients served as a control group. There was a tendency towards higher FSH levels in the MPA-treated patients than in the controls. Following treatment, serum testosterone was significantly lower in patients who had received MPA during their intensive chemotherapy than in the controls. There was no difference between the groups with regard to recovery of sperm cell production after chemotherapy. An MPA-induced medical castration during intensive chemotherapy in testicular cancer patients is ineffective in protecting the remaining testis against treatment-induced damage to spermatogenesis, at least if hormone treatment is started simultaneously with chemotherapy.\r"

The patients were randomly allocated to receive either 2500 anti-factor Xa units LMWH twice daily for 7 days, with the first dose given 2 h before surgery; or 500 ml dextran 70 twice during the day of operation, followed by a single infusion of 500 ml on the first and again on the third postoperative day. DVT was assessed by 125I-fibrinogen test for 2 weeks postoperatively, a positive test being followed by phlebography. DVT developed in 22 (45 per cent) of 49 patients receiving dextran 70 and in 10 (20 per cent) of 49 patients in the LMWH group (P less than 0.01). LMWH was thus statistically significantly better than dextran 70 in preventing DVT in the legs. It was not firmly established whether this benefit was also valid in the high ileofemoral region. Two patients with non-fatal pulmonary embolism were found in each group. Per- and postoperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirements were significantly lower in the LMWH group.\r"

Although not a criterion for diagnosis, Lisch nodules were almost invariably present in the iris (93% of patients overall; 96% of those aged greater than or equal to 20 yrs). The complications of von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis in this cohort (n = 135 unless stated) were plexiform neurofibromas (40/125), severe mental retardation (1), epilepsy (6), optic glioma (2), spinal neurofibroma (2), aqueduct stenosis (2), meningioangiomatosis (1), scoliosis requiring surgery (6), pseudoarthrosis (3), delayed puberty (2), visceral and endocrine tumours (6), and congenital glaucoma (1). There were no cases of acoustic neuroma. Considering all living family members aged greater than or equal to 18 yrs, together with their deceased relatives, the frequency of CNS and malignant tumours related to the disease was 4.4-5.2%. Uncomplicated von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis is disfiguring but not a major cause of morbidity. The management of the disease relates to its complications which can be divided into three categories: those which occur in childhood and cause lifelong morbidity (moderate-severe mental handicap, facial plexiform neurofibromas, orthopaedic), those which can occur at any time but are 'treatable' (benign disorders of the nervous system, visceral and endocrine tumours, renal artery stenosis), and malignant or CNS tumours. The combined frequency for each category based on this survey was 12%, 16% and 4.4-5.2%, respectively.\r"

In man, there is evidence of dependence on the DA2-receptor for the natriuresis produced by central blood volume expansion. 2. Six normal volunteers underwent infusions of alpha-human ANP preceded by domperidone (a DA2-antagonist) or placebo. Eight volunteers underwent a 3 h period of 10 degrees head-down tilt also preceded by domperidone or placebo. 3. Both the ANP infusion and head-down tilt produced a significant diuresis and natriuresis, neither of which was antagonized by the presence of domperidone. 4. The ANP infusion significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure and produced significant increases in the Doppler-measured aortic blood velocity variables of peak velocity and maximal acceleration. Domperidone had an independent effect of increasing blood pressure but did not appear to have a specific interaction with the haemodynamic effects of ANP. 5. Head-down tilt reduced mean arterial pressure and heart rate and increased maximal acceleration. Again, an independent effect of domperidone was seen on blood pressure. Heart rate and maximal acceleration showed similar changes in the presence of domperidone. 6. Domperidone does not antagonize the renal or haemodynamic effects of ANP and if dopaminergic activation is necessary for the renal action of ANP it is unlikely to be mediated by the DA2-receptor.\r"

We have nevertheless demonstrated the presence in bronchoalveolar lavage of an elastase with the characteristics of a metalloproteinase, although samples also contained a substantial amount of activity that was sensitive to serine proteinase inhibitors. 4. Fractionation of lavage fluid supernatant by size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated most of the elastase activity to be of molecular mass greater than 300 kDa. Treatment of samples with lipase or detergent caused a reduction in metalloelastase activity and the generation of lower-molecular-mass components (90-100 kDa and 40 kDa) which were predominantly serine elastases. This suggested that the enzymes were associated with lipid.\r"

Two groups of rats (Mg2+ control and Mg2+ + MCT) were started on oral Mg2+ (15.4 g/l magnesium aspartate hydrochloride dissolved in deionized water) 2 weeks before the MCT injection. The rest were given deionized water. At the start of the experiment, the control groups (deionized water and Mg2+) were given normal saline subcutaneously; the other groups (deionized water and Mg2+) were given MCT (60 mg/kg) subcutaneously. 4. Pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, lung pathology, organ weights and serum electrolytes were assessed 3 weeks after a single subcutaneous injection of MCT. Seventy-five per cent of the rats treated with MCT and oral Mg2+ (12 out of 16) showed significant reduction in pulmonary arterial hypertension, arterial pathology and right ventricular hypertrophy. 5. Our data indicate that Mg2+ attenuates experimentally induced pulmonary hypertension, possibly either by modulating the intracellular Ca2+ level and/or by directly affecting the pulmonary endothelial cell-smooth muscle cell complex involved in metabolism and maintenance of pulmonary vascular resistance.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that elevated atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) may be involved in altered fluid homeostasis at high altitude, we examined 25 mountaineers at an altitude of 550 m and 6, 18, and 42 h after arrival at an altitude of 4,559 m, which was climbed in 24 h starting from 3,220 m. In 14 subjects, symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) were absent or mild (group A), whereas 11 subjects had severe AMS (group B). Fluid intake was similar in both groups. In group B, urine flow decreased from 61 +/- 8 (base line) to 36 +/- 3 (SE) ml/h (maximal decrease) (P less than 0.05) and sodium excretion from 7.9 +/- 0.9 to 4.6 +/- 0.7) mmol.l-1.h-1 (P less than 0.05); ANP increased from 31 +/- 4 to 87 +/- 26 pmol/l (P less than 0.001), plasma aldosterone from 191 +/- 27 to 283 +/- 55 pmol/l (P less than 0.01 compared with group A), and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 pmol/l (P = 0.08 compared with group A). These variables did not change significantly in group A, with the exception of a decrease in plasma aldosterone from 189 +/- 19 to 111 +/- 17 pmol/l (P less than 0.01). There were no measurable effects of elevated ANP on natriuresis, cortisol, or blood pressure. The reduced diuresis in AMS may be explained by increased plasma aldosterone and ADH overriding the expected renal action of ANP. The significance of elevated ANP in AMS remains to be established.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similar application of the imidazole-histidine blocking agent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) decreased the slope by 40.3% (P less than 0.01) and the maximum value by 29.3% (P less than 0.05). Both responses confirm previous results. DEPC treatment decreased the effectiveness of subsequent pirenzepine application such that although slope and maximum were further decreased, the values were not significantly different from those after DEPC. Pirenzepine treatment prevented any subsequent DEPC inhibitory effect. The results raise the possibility that the inhibitory effects of DEPC on CO2 chemosensitivity are via muscarinic receptors and that muscarinic receptor involvement in CO2 chemosensitivity requires the presence of imidazole-histidine. Analysis by scintillation counting of successive 100-micron sections of medulla after rostral area application of [3H]pirenzepine indicated that the pirenzepine and DEPC effects are most probably within 2.0 mm of the ventral surface as measured from the midline, well away from the dorsal and ventral respiratory group neurons.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential role of natriuretic factor (ANF) on changes on renal excretory function in response to increased intrathoracic pressure, seven patients were studied during three successive 60-min periods of 1) mechanical ventilation (MV) and zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), 2) MV with 12 cmH2O positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and 3) MV with the same level of PEEP while lower-body positive pressure (LBPP) was applied to restore venous return and increase central blood volume without fluid loading. Hemodynamics, renal excretory function parameters, and plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (irANF) levels were recorded at the end of each period. Compared with ZEEP, PEEP induced a significant reduction of diuresis (from 134 +/- 17 to 59 +/- 13 ml/h, P less than 0.01) and natriuresis (from 8.37 +/- 3.5 to 3.83 +/- 2 mmol/h, P less than 0.01), whereas plasma irANF fell from 520 +/- 292 to 155 +/- 40 pg/ml (P less than 0.01) and transmural right atrial pressure decreased from 3.9 +/- 0.5 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Opposite changes were observed during application of LBPP, which restored diuresis and plasma irANF to near control ZEEP values, despite continuation of PEEP. Changes in renal excretory function parameters thus paralleled changes in right atrial pressure and plasma irANF. We suggest that changes in plasma irANF in response to hemodynamic variations induced by changes in intrathoracic pressure may contribute to alterations of renal excretory function during PEEP.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of endogenous and exogenous atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on pulmonary hemodynamics was investigated in anesthetized pigs during both normoxia and hypoxia. Continuous hypoxic ventilation with 11% O2 was associated with a uniform but transient increase of plasma immunoreactive (ir) ANF that peaked at 15 min. Plasma irANF was inversely related to pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; r = -0.66, P less than 0.01) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; r = -0.56, P less than 0.05) at 30 min of hypoxia in 14 animals; no such relationship was found during normoxia. ANF infusion after 60 min of hypoxia in seven pigs reduced the 156 +/- 20% increase in PVR to 124 +/- 18% (P less than 0.01) at 0.01 microgram.kg-1.min-1 and to 101 +/- 15% (P less than 0.001) at 0.05 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Cardiac output (CO) and systemic arterial pressure (Psa) remained unchanged, whereas mean Ppa decreased from 25.5 +/- 1.5 to 20.5 +/- 15 mmHg (P less than 0.001) and plasma irANF increased two- to nine-fold. ANF infused at 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 (resulting in a 50-fold plasma irANF increase) decreased Psa (-14%) and reduced CO (-10%); systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was not changed, nor was a further decrease in PVR induced. No change in PVR or SVR occurred in normoxic animals at any ANF infusion rate. These results suggest that ANF may act as an endogenous pulmonary vasodilator that could modulate the pulmonary pressor response to hypoxia.\r"

  ".W": "The ratio G = delta VE/delta VCO2 where delta VA is change in ventilation and delta VCO2 is change in CO2 production, is often used to quantitate the ventilatory response to exercise and is the overall system gain (G). However, the actual variable of interest often is the gain for the exercise stimulus (GEX). Exercise stimulus refers to a stimulus or group of stimuli other than the mean levels of arterial PO2 (PaCO2), PCO2 (PaCO2), and pH (pHa) that act to increase ventilation during exercise. GEX will be equal to G only if the response to exercise is precisely isocapnic, normoxic, and without metabolic acidosis. A mathematical model was used to examine the relationship between G and GEX when 1) the response to exercise is not strictly isocapnic and 2) when the resting PaCO2 is shifted away from its normal value. It was found that 1) when the exercise response was not strictly isocapnic, G was a poor estimate of GEX and 2) when resting PaCO2 was changed while GEX wa assumed to remain constant, G was a function of the resting PaCO2. However, this dependence of G on resting PaCO2 is a system property that was caused by the nonlinear properties of the gas exchange processes and was not a fundamental property of the controller. It is concluded that G may not always be a good estimate of GEX and may lead to incorrect conclusions concerning the nature of the exercise stimulus.\r"

Eight subjects cycled for 2 h on three separate occasions to deplete their muscle glycogen stores. Immediately and 2 h after exercise they consumed either 0 (P), 1.5 (L), or 3.0 g glucose/kg body wt (H) from a 50% glucose polymer solution. Blood samples were drawn from an antecubital vein before exercise, during exercise, and throughout recovery. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis immediately, 2 h, and 4 h after exercise. Blood glucose and insulin declined significantly during exercise in each of the three treatments. They remained below the preexercise concentrations during recovery in the P treatment but increased significantly above the preexercise concentrations during the L and H treatments. By the end of the 4 h-recovery period, blood glucose and insulin were still significantly above the preexercise concentrations in both treatments. Muscle glycogen storage was significantly increased above the basal rate (P, 0.5 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1) after ingestion of either glucose polymer supplement. The rates of muscle glycogen storage, however, were not different between the L and H treatments during the first 2 h (L, 5.2 +/- 0.9 vs. H, 5.8 +/- 0.7 mumol.g wet wt-1.h-1) or the second 2 h of recovery (L, 4.0 +/- 0.9 vs. H, 4.5 +/- 0.6 mumol.g wet wt-1. h-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated that in vivo reperfusion of a dog lung after 48 h of pulmonary arterial (PA) ischemia results in pulmonary edema with a significant infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. We hypothesized that the injury resulted from production of hydroxyl radical by activated neutrophils. In the current study, we attempted to prevent the injury in both dogs and rabbits with dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a scavenger of hydroxyl radical. After 48 h of left PA occlusion in 18 dogs, DMTU was administered to 9 animals and 9 were not treated. The occlusion was then released, and the dogs were killed 4 h later. Reperfusion resulted in a drop in leukocyte count and left lung edema, but there was no difference between treated and untreated animals. The wet-to-dry ratios of the lungs in the treated group were 5.76 +/- 0.44 (SE) on the reperfused left side and 4.50 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.05) on the right side. In the untreated groups the comparable ratios were 5.73 +/- 0.31 and 4.92 +/- 0.10 (P less than 0.05 for right vs. left). Histological examination revealed significant differences between the right and left lungs in the extent of intra-alveolar granulocytes and macrophages but did not reveal differences between the treated and untreated animals. To ensure that neither the model nor the lack of response to DMTU was species specific, we then developed a rabbit model of reperfusion edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At the same time, femoral venous PCO2 increased to 100 Torr and plasma [La-] to 9.7 meq/l; however, plasma [SID] did not change because of a concomitant increase in inorganic [SID] secondary to increases in [K+], [Na+], and [Ca2+]. During recovery, muscle [La-] fell to 26 meq/l by 9.5 min; [SID] remained low (101 and 114 meq/l at 3.5 and 9.5 min, respectively) due almost equally to the elevated [La-] (30 and 26 meq/l) and reductions in [K+] (from 142 meq/l at rest to 123 and 128 meq/l).

Arterial and deep forearm venous blood were sampled at rest and during 10 min after exercise; ventilation and pulmonary gas exchange variables were measured breath by breath during exercise and recovery. Immediately after exercise, ventilation and CO2 output increased to 124 +/- 17 1/min and 3.24 +/- 0.195 l/min, respectively. The subsequent decrease in CO2 output was slower than the decrease in O2 intake (half time of 105 +/- 15 and 47 +/- 4 s, respectively); the respiratory exchange ratio was greater than 1.0 throughout the 10 min of recovery. Arterial plasma concentrations of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ increased transiently after exercise. Arterial lactate ion concentration ([La-]) increased to 14-15 meq/l within 1.5 min and remained at this level for the rest of the study. Throughout recovery there was a positive arteriovenous [La-] difference of 4-5 meq/l, associated with an increase in the arteriovenous strong ion difference ([SID]) and by a large increase in the venous Pco2 and [HCO3-]. These findings were interpreted as indicating uptake of La- by the inactive muscle, leading to a fall in the muscle [SID] and increase in plasma [SID], associated with an increase in muscle PCO2. The venoarterial CO2 content difference was 38% greater than could be accounted for by metabolism of La- alone, suggesting liberation of CO2 stored in muscle, possibly as carbamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conceivably, this VA/Q inequality might result from differences in VA/Q ratios among lobes caused by nonuniform distribution of ventilation, even though individual lobes are relatively homogeneous. Alternatively, the VA/Q inequality may occur at a lobar level if those factors causing the VA/Q mismatch also existed within lobes. We compared the efficiency of gas exchange simultaneously in whole lung and left lower lobe by use of the multiple inert gas elimination technique in nine anesthetized open-chest dogs. Measurements of whole lung and left lower lobe gas exchange allowed comparison of the degree of VA/Q inequality within vs. among lobes. During IPPV with positive end-expiratory pressure, arterial PO2 and PCO2 (183 +/- 41 and 34.3 +/- 3.1 Torr, respectively) were similar to lobar venous PO2 and PCO2 (172 +/- 64 and 35.7 +/- 4.1 Torr, respectively; inspired O2 fraction = 0.44 +/- 0.02). Switching to CFV (3 l.kg-1.min-1) decreased arterial PO2 (112 +/- 26 Torr, P less than 0.001) and lobar venous PO2 (120 +/- 27 Torr, P less than 0.01) but did not change the shunt measured with inert gases (P greater than 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arachidonate evoked epithelium-dependent relaxations, which were less pronounced in subsegmental bronchi and abolished by indomethacin and meclofenamate. Nordihydroguairetic acid (NDGA) and nafazatrom reduced epithelium-dependent relaxations only in lobar but unmasked epithelium-independent relaxations to arachidonate in all bronchi. Prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin relaxed all tissues similarly. In lobar bronchi without epithelium, basal release of prostaglandin E2 was reduced by indomethacin but unaffected by NDGA. Arachidonate augmented prostaglandin E2 release more in subsegmental than in lobar bronchi with epithelium; in bronchi without epithelium the rise was absent (lobar) or attenuated (subsegmental). Arachidonate augmented the release of 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha more in lobar bronchi with than without epithelium; this was inhibited by indomethacin, but not NDGA. Thus arachidonate releases prostaglandin E2 (possibly produced by cyclooxygenase inaccessible to inhibitors and activated by lipoxygenase products) but not prostacyclin from the epithelium. Heterogeneity in response to arachidonate is not due to different sensitivity to, or production of, prostaglandins.\r"

The average lung CA activity, with a reaction velocity constant of 5.32 +/- 2.2 s-1, is sufficient to accelerate CO2 reactions in lung water by two orders of magnitude over the uncatalyzed rate at 22 degrees C and a PCO2 of 40 Torr. Three sulfonamide inhibitors of CA with different human erythrocyte membrane permeabilities were used to determine the availability of the enzyme to the perfusate. Ethoxzolamide, the most permeable at 0.1 microM (100 times its inhibition constant, of Ki) inhibited 85% of enzyme activity after exposure of the lung for 3 min and 94% of enzyme activity after 30 min, whereas 1.25 microM (320 times its Ki) acetazolamide (1/165 as permeable) only inhibited CA 28% at 3 min and 75% at 30 min. Benzolamide (less than 1/1,000 as permeable) at 4 microM (1,000 times its Ki) inhibited only approximately 17% of control CA activity by 5 min and 48% by 30 min after the start of perfusion. These data indicate the CA available to pulmonary capillary plasma is approximately 10% of the total lung CA activity, in agreement with published measurements on the homogenized lung.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in isolated guinea pig lungs perfused with phosphate-buffered Ringer solution. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), pulmonary capillary pressure (Ppc), and change in lung weight were recorded at 0, 10, 25, 40, and 70 min. The capillary filtration coefficient (Kf), an index of vascular permeability, was measured at 10 and 70 min. The perfusion of PMA (0.5 x 10(-7) M) increased Ppa, Ppc, and lung weight at 70 min. The ratio of arterial-to-venous vascular resistance (Ra/Rv) decreased and the Kf did not change with PMA. The perfusion of the lung with 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate (inactive toward the protein kinase C analogue of PMA) did not affect the lung. The inhibition of TxA2 synthase with dazoxiben inhibited the response to PMA. The inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase with U-60257 and the SRS-A receptor antagonist FPL 55712 also prevented the response to PMA. The addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, or SOD plus catalase (the enzymes that remove O.2 H2O2, and OH., respectively) did not prevent the PMA effect or the release of TxA2; however, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a scavenger of OH., did prevent the response to PMA. The data indicate that PMA causes a neutrophil-independent increase in lung weight due to increases in Ppc mediated by TxA2 and SRS-A. The protective effect of DMTU may be due to the inhibition of TxA2 generation.\r"

  ".W": "The thermoregulatory responses of menstruant women to exercise in dry heat (dry-bulb temperature/wet-bulb temperature = 48/25 degrees C) were evaluated at three times during the menstrual cycle: menstrual flow (MF), 3-5 days during midcycle including ovulation (OV), and in the middle of the luteal phase (LU). Serum concentrations of estradiol-17 beta (E2), progesterone (Pg), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by radioimmunoassay, and these values were used to determine the dates of OV (peak LH and FSH) and LU (peak postovulatory Pg). After heat acclimation, subjects received heat stress tests (HST) consisting of a 2-h cycle-ergometer exercise at 30% of maximal O2 consumption in the heat. Rectal (Tre) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures, heart rate (HR), and sweat rate on the chest and thigh were recorded continuously. Total sweat loss (Msw), as indicated by weight loss, was recorded every 20 min, and equivalent water replacement was given. Steady-state exercise metabolic rate (M) was measured at 45 and 110 min. Seven of eight subjects had ovulatory cycles during experimental months. At rest, Tre was lowest at OV and significantly higher at LU. During steady-state exercise both Tre and Tsk were lowest at OV and significantly higher at LU. There were no differences between phases in Msw, sweat rate on the chest and thigh or M. Despite higher Tre and Tsk at LU, all subjects were able to complete the 2-h of exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary hypertension in rats, induced by an injection of monocrotaline, is associated with changes in the wall structure of the pulmonary arterial bed. We have studied the effects of this remodeling on mechanical properties of cylindrical pulmonary artery segments from rats 21 days after monocrotaline (MCT) injection. Resting and active (KCl induced) circumference-tension relationships were established for segments of extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary arteries isolated from the hilum and the fifth lateral branch from the axial pathway (all preacinar). The thicknesses of the vessel wall, the media, and adventitia were measured at several positions around the circumference of the artery by computerized analysis of histological cross sections of the segments fixed at a standard circumference. Resting and active stress were also calculated. The study shows that active circumferential tension and active stress are reduced in vessels from MCT-treated rats. Based on our findings, it is unlikely that altered contractile function of preacinar arteries contributes significantly to the increased vascular resistance seen in this model.\r"

When [14C]H3--H4folate was given, methionine caused an increased [14C]0(2) excretion, indicating that oxidation of the methyl group had occurred. Methionine was more effective than S-adenosylmethionine at causing oxidation, but serine was ineffective. The lowest dose of methionine to produce an effect was 0.5 mumol, which is less than the daily dietary intake in a rat. The data suggest that the concentration of methylfolate in rat livers is controlled by the concentrations of methionine.\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometric method was used to measure the generation in whole blood of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a potent stimulator of neutrophil chemotaxis, in eight patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) and 12 healthy controls. LTB4 was detectable in unstimulated samples from all the patients (mean 194 (70 SEM) pg/ml), and the capacity for LTB4 production after stimulation with calcium ionophore (A23187) was similar in patients (32.1 (11) ng/10(6) leucocytes) and controls (38.1 (4) ng/10(6) leucocytes). In response to stimuli which induce neutrophil activation, LTB4 production was significantly greater in the patients than in controls: 35.6 (13) v 13.0 (3) ng/ml, p less than 0.05 (f-met-leu-phe); and 42.4 (16) v 14.7 (4) ng/ml, p less than 0.02 (opsonised zymosan). Anti-IgE stimulated considerably more LTB4 production in patients with CGL than in controls (3.86 (1.6) v 0.83 (0.43) ng/ml; p less than 0.005) and this correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with the basophil count. Neutrophil chemotaxis to LTB4, however, was significantly impaired in the patients with CGL even at the highest concentration of LTB4 (10(-5) M). Chemotaxis to f-met-leu-phe, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing were normal. Thus although LTB4 synthesis is normal or even enhanced in patients with CGL, specific defects in LTB4-mediated responses may contribute to neutrophil dysfunction in this disease.\r"

The concentration curves of VPA in whole blood after an oral morning dose (mean 8.2 mg/kg body wt.) closely followed those in plasma but at a reduced level. The apparent volume of distribution (Vd) of total VPA was 0.150-0.197 l/kg body wt. and of free VPA 0.911-1.58 l/kg body wt., which indicates considerable distribution of unbound VPA as well as drug binding to extravascular proteins. The terminal half-life of free VPA (6.4-6.7 h) was significantly shorter (P less than 0.05) than the half-life of total VPA (10.4-11.9 h). The binding of VPA in plasma was concentration dependent and fluctuated considerably within the individual dosage intervals. Concentrations of unbound VPA in plasma water of whole blood varied to a corresponding degree, since distribution to blood cells was low (mean 2.2%). It is concluded that there are substantial differences in the pharmacokinetics of free and total VPA. This may contribute to the well-known poor correlation between dose, plasma concentrations and effect of VPA.\r"

He argues that essentially the most important information is virtually a binary, or all or none, phenomenon; in other words, carbon dioxide is either continuously present in the breathing circuit or is absent. Thus, circuit disconnects and undesirable endotracheal tube locations are readily identified. He relates the analog display of information to that of an automobile speedometer or the hands of a standard wrist watch. The author also compares analog meters with those used by pilots in aviation. He concludes with the argument that the carbon dioxide analyzer provides necessary information without the need to resort to expensive microprocessed displays that would include the waveform and trending, but would substantially increase the cost of the instrument.\r"
