Antibodies reacting with corticotropin-secreting mouse AtT20 and PRL-secreting rat GH3 cells were found in 24 (75%) and 15 (47%), respectively, of the 32 patients; 14 patients (44%) had antibodies reacting with both cell lines. In patients with pituitary adenomas, the prevalence of antipituitary antibodies was significantly lower than in those with the empty sella syndrome; 1 of 9 acromegalic patients had antibodies reacting with GH3 cells, and 2 of 9 prolactinoma patients and 1 of 7 patients with nonfunctioning adenomas had antibodies reacting with both AtT20 and GH3 cells. Among 6 patients with idiopathic diabetes insipidus, 1 patient had antibodies reacting with AtT20 and GH3 cells, and 2 patients had antibodies reacting with either AtT20 or GH3 cells. None of 5 patients with established autoimmune diseases (3 with systemic lupus erythematosus and 2 with autoimmune adrenal failure) had antipituitary antibodies in their serum. These results suggest that pituitary antibodies may be related to the development of pituitary atrophy and the primary empty sella syndrome, and that the test may be clinically useful as a screening test for the empty sella syndrome.\r"

  ".U": "88331296\r", 
  ".W": "The MCR of testosterone is decreased but the MCR of estradiol is unchanged in men with cirrhosis and elevated serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations. Previous studies indicated that SHBG from cirrhotic men selectively delivers estradiol, but not testosterone, to peripheral tissues of rats in vivo. These results suggest that estradiol and testosterone may bind to different SHBG isoforms in serum and that the estradiol-binding isoforms may be selectively altered in cirrhosis. This hypothesis was tested by polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing and fast protein liquid chromatography chromatofocusing. After Concanavalin-A affinity purification of serum glycoproteins from pregnant women, normal men, normal women, and cirrhotic men, the glycoprotein fraction was reconstituted, labeled with [3H]testosterone or [3H]estradiol, and applied to isoelectric focusing gels. Testosterone was bound selectively by the most acidic isoforms of SHBG, pI 4.5-5.4, and there was a significant anodal shift of the estradiol-binding isoforms in serum from cirrhotic men compared to that in serum from normal men. The selective binding of testosterone to the most acidic isoforms of SHBG was confirmed by fast protein liquid chromatography chromatofocusing, wherein the binding reactions were measured at neutral pH after separation of the isoforms. These biochemical studies and previous physiological experiments question the conventional view that testosterone and estradiol bind to a single competitive binding site on SHBG. Rather, testosterone is selectively bound by the most acidic SHBG isoforms. The estradiol-binding isoforms undergo a significant anodal shift in cirrhosis; this abnormality may result in the lack of decrease in estradiol MCR in cirrhosis.\r"

The effect of vitamin D supplementation for 1 yr was studied in 72 people living in a nursing home and 70 people living in an aged people's home. The subjects were randomized into 3 groups: control, and 400 or 800 IU vitamin D3/day. The initial vitamin D status of each subject was classified as deficient or borderline [serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) less than 30 nmol/L] in 79% and adequate (serum 25OHD greater than or equal to 30 nmol/L) in 21%. Serum 25OHD concentrations increased about 3-fold in both groups receiving vitamin D supplementation. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] concentrations increased slightly but significantly, and the increase was inversely related to the initial serum 25OHD concentration. Serum intact PTH-(1-84) concentrations decreased about 15% during supplementation in both nursing home and aged people's home residents, whereas serum osteocalcin significantly decreased in the nursing home residents only. We conclude that a vitamin D3 supplement of 400 IU/day adequately improves vitamin D status in elderly people and increases 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations in those with vitamin D deficiency. Supplementation decreases parathyroid function and may depress bone turnover to some degree.\r"

The patients were evaluated before treatment, at 15, 30, and 90 days during treatment, and then at 90-day intervals during propranolol treatment by clinical examination and measurement of serum free T3, free T4, rT3, TSH, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations and serum anti-thyroglobulin, antithyroid microsomal, antithyroid peroxidase, and thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies. Eighteen patients who had no biochemical improvement during propranolol therapy or relapsed after initial improvement were treated conventionally. In contrast, eight patients had a biochemical remission, which has lasted 30-48 months after propranolol withdrawal. The biochemical values before and during treatment did not differ among the two groups of patients, except for the initial serum free T3 levels which were significantly higher in the patients who had no remission. Serum TSH levels returned to normal only in patients who had a long-lasting remission. While thyroid autoantibodies decreased or disappeared during follow-up, the evolution of thyroid-stimulating autoantibody values was grossly related to the clinical outcome. Long-lasting remissions may occur in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease not given ablative or antithyroid drug therapy. Since propranolol is devoid of antithyroid and immunosuppressive actions, these remissions are probably spontaneous. Although they tended to occur in patients with less severe disease, no biological parameter was found that predicted the outcome.\r"

Quantitative morphology was studied in the resected thyroid tissue from the patients in groups I (n = 15) and II (n = 6) who had Graves' disease. While serum thyroid hormone levels became normal during preoperative treatment in group I, they remained elevated in the group II patients. The rate of protein synthesis was 2-fold higher in thyroid tissue from patients in group II than in those in groups I and III. A tendency toward an increased amount of epithelium and a reduced amount of colloid was found in thyroid tissue from patients in group II. There was a positive correlation between the rate of protein synthesis, and distribution of epithelium, and the epithelium to colloid ratio, respectively, in thyroid tissue. These results suggest that the thyroid gland of hyperthyroid patients remains hyperactive during treatment with beta-adrenergic antagonist drugs.\r"

This variability can be due to allotypic (person to person) variability in the receptors or differences in autoantibody amount or specificity. This fundamental issue was investigated by evaluating immunoglobulin G (Ig)-induced TSH receptor modulation in thyroid tissue from 19 patients with GD. TSH receptor modulation by Graves' Ig was defined as the appearance of 1 class of high affinity binding sites, instead of the usual 2 classes of binding sites. Ig-induced modulation of receptors occurred in 9 of 19 (47%) experiments with autologous (patient's own) tissues and correlated with the presence of TSH receptor antibodies, measured as TSH binding inhibitor Igs. Of these 9 receptor-modulating Graves' Ig preparations, 7 (78%) also had a receptor-modulating effect in other patient's (homologous) thyroid tissue. Nine of the 10 Graves' Ig preparations that were negative for TSH receptor-modulating activity in autologous thyroid tissue were tested with other patients' thyroid tissues; 7 (78%) were negative, and all were TSH binding inhibitor Ig negative. We conclude that variability in the occurrence of TSH receptor modulation was associated with the presence or absence of TSH-binding inhibitor Ig. No evidence for allotypic differences in TSH receptors in GD was found.\r"

To avoid artefacts that occur in competitor studies with diluted serum or isolated binding proteins, we used undiluted normal serum, with drugs added at concentrations that achieved high therapeutic total and free serum levels at equilibrium. Drug addition was based on the measured free fraction of each drug in serum. The free T4 fraction in normal serum (Tris buffer, pH 7.4; 37 C) was between 1.40 X 10(-4) and 1.53 X 10(-4). Drug-induced increases in T4 free fraction were: fenclofenac, 90%; aspirin, 62%; meclofenamic acid, 39%; diflunisal, 37%; mefenamic acid, 31%; and furosemide, 31%. Significant increases of 7-15% occurred with diclofenac, flufenamic acid, phenylbutazone, and diphenylhydantoin. Indomethacin, ketoprofen, tolmetin, ethacrynic acid, bumetanide, iopanoate, and ipodate were inactive at the concentrations studied. Addition of 2.0 mmol/L oleic acid had a negligible effect, but 3.5 mmol/L oleic acid inhibited T3 and T4 binding significantly. Other long chain NEFA (addition of 1.5 mmol/L) gave increases in free T4 fraction as follows: arachidonic acid, 26%; linolenic acid, 23%; and linoleic acid, 11%. Stearic and palmitic acids were inactive. The effect of 5 mmol/L oleic acid in serum could be reproduced by addition of 0.5 mmol/L to serum diluted 1:10, indicating that protein binding of NEFA is the major determinant that limits their competitor potency. These findings provide a basis for anticipating which potential inhibitors may cause important changes in serum thyroid hormone binding. The time course of such effects will be influenced by the pharmacokinetics of the inhibitor itself as well as the equilibrium findings described here.\r"

Sixteen prolactinomas were studied by electron microscopy. The presurgical diagnosis of the tumors as prolactinomas was based on the findings of hyperprolactinemia and radiographic abnormalities, and was confirmed by the electron microscopic features of the specimens as well as by immunocytochemical staining for PRL. In addition to the presence of fenestrated endothelial cells, which are characteristic of the normal capillaries of the anterior pituitary, 13 of the 16 prolactinomas contained arteries. These arteries ranged from well formed vessels with multiple layers of smooth muscle cells to abnormal terminal arterioles, i.e. vessels with fenestrated endothelium surrounded by a variable number of smooth muscle cells. Arteries were not found in anterior pituitaries from 8 patients with no pituitary disease. In the prolactinomas, smooth muscle cells also were found, either isolated in the pericapillary connective tissue space or in small cords some distance from the vessel lumen. The results suggest that vascular changes, including arteriogenesis, occur in prolactinomas (and possibly other types of pituitary tumor). The arteries entering the anterior pituitary directly could be congenital or develop during formation of the tumor. An arterial blood supply to a region of the anterior pituitary could result in the escape of that area from hypothalamic regulation, since systemic blood contains negligible levels of hypothalamic hormones. In the case of PRL-secreting cells, which are tonically inhibited by the hypothalamic hormone dopamine, this would result in hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and possibly tumorigenesis.\r"

Compared with 262 normal subjects or 194 patients with euthyroid diffuse goiter with normal serum TSH levels, RAIU values were significantly higher in 100 patients with latent primary hypothyroidism (serum TSH, 5-40 mU/L). In 126 patients with overt primary hypothyroidism (serum TSH, greater than 40 mU/L), RAIU values were either extremely high (49 patients with reversible hypothyroidism and 10 patients with postpartum hypothyroidism) or low (67 patients with irreversible hypothyroidism). The increase in RAIU values in latent, or reversible overt hypothyroidism was TSH dependent, and there was a good correlation between RAIU values and serum TSH levels (r = 0.6203; P less than 0.001). In overt primary hypothyroidism, spontaneous recovery of thyroid function during iodide restriction alone occurred in 52 of 53 patients with RAIU values above 35%, in only 7 of 23 patients with RAIU values between 10-35%, and in none of 50 patients with RAIU below 10%. Thus, recovery was predicted by high RAIU values (P less than 0.001; prediction rate, 91.4%). Goiter was found in about 80% of the patients with reversible hypothyroidism, compared with only 34% of the patients with irreversible hypothyroidism. Recovery of thyroid function during iodide restriction also occurred in 71% of the patients with latent hypothyroidism. However, RAIU measurements did not predict the prognosis of patients with latent hypothyroidism. We conclude that iodine-induced reversible hypothyroidism is common in our patient population, and RAIU measurements may be helpful in determining the prognosis of patients with overt primary hypothyroidism.\r"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes may serve as a model for detecting hereditary defects in the response of classical target organs to 1,25-(OH)2D. Delayed bone mineralization and deficient intestinal calcium absorption are common in low birth weight formula-fed infants. The defect in calcium absorption exists despite normal or even elevated serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels, suggesting partial end-organ resistance to the hormone. We assessed the response to 1,25-(OH)2D of activated mononuclear cells obtained from cord blood of fullterm and preterm infants and from peripheral blood of adults. We found that the inhibitory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D on mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation was significantly less [mean, 34 +/- 8% (+/- SE)] in mononuclear cells from neonates (independent of gestational age) compared to mononuclear cells from adults (66 +/- 5%; P less than 0.001). This difference in the inhibitory effect was not due to a smaller number of high affinity receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D in activated cord blood lymphocytes. We conclude that the coupling between the receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D and the biological response in neonates is less efficient than that in adults.\r"

Patients initially diagnosed as having a parathyroid adenoma have subsequently occasionally developed metastases, and thereby their tumor was proven to be a carcinoma. To determine whether the nuclear DNA content would correlate with the clinical course and pathology of parathyroid tumors DNA cytometry was performed on parathyroid carcinomas (9 patients), histologically atypical adenomas (10 patients), adenomas associated with severe hypercalcemia [serum calcium, greater than or equal to 13.0 mg/dL (greater than or equal to 3.24 mmol/L); 11 patients], typical benign adenomas (11 patients), and incidentally removed normal parathyroid glands (6 patients). Sections were cut from the original paraffin-embedded surgical specimens and stained for nuclear DNA using the azure A Feulgen reaction. Nuclear DNA stain content was measured using an integrating image cytometer, and the results were plotted as histograms. Adjusted optical density (AOD) values were measured (in arbitrary units) to estimate the DNA content of whole nuclei in the specimens. The mean nuclear DNA content in the parathyroid carcinomas [24.6 +/- 2.1 (+/- SE) AOD] was significantly greater than that in the three groups of parathyroid adenomas (P less than 0.005, by unpaired t test) and in the normal parathyroid glands (P less than 0.0005). The mean nuclear DNA content in the atypical adenomas (15.8 +/- 1.6 AOD), profoundly hypercalcemic adenomas (16.8 +/- 1.3 AOD), and typical adenomas (16.0 +/- 1.1. AOD) were similar, and all were significantly greater than that in the normal parathyroid glands (11.5 +/- 0.7 AOD, P less than 0.05). Five distinct DNA histogram patterns were present in the parathyroid specimens from these 47 patients. Four of the 9 parathyroid carcinomas had an aneuploid DNA pattern, an abnormal pattern not found in any of the other groups; 2 of these tumors were originally diagnosed as atypical parathyroid adenomas. Both patients developed recurrent disease, and 1 died from a hepatic metastasis. Therefore, DNA cytometry provides valuable information in differentiating some parathyroid carcinomas from adenomas and diagnosing certain parathyroid carcinomas before the appearance of grossly invasive or metastatic tumor.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study of 202 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) diagnosed between 1943 and 1987 was done to compare the prognosis of patients with sporadic disease and those with the familial form of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II and to study the effect of radiotherapy. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type II had a significantly higher survival rate than did patients with the sporadic variety (P less than 0.005), but most patients with sporadic tumors were older and had more advanced disease. No differences in survival rates were found when patients from these 2 groups were matched for age and involvement of the thyroid gland only (P greater than 0.3), involvement of the thyroid gland plus cervical nodes (P greater than 0.3), and involvement of the thyroid gland, cervical nodes, and soft tissue (P greater than 0.7). When patients with MTC who received radiotherapy were matched for age, extent of disease, and surgery with patients who had had no radiotherapy, the latter group was found to live significantly longer (P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) the apparently poor prognosis of patients with the sporadic variety of MTC may be related to the patients' older age at detection rather than to inherent differences in the two forms of disease, and 2) radiotherapy has little effect on MTC.\r"

  ".W": "To study the influence of 5 alpha-reductase on the concentration of dihydrotestosterone in prostatic tissue, we measured the activity of this enzyme in stroma and epithelium from 15 normal, 50 hyperplastic, and 20 carcinomatous prostates. Maximum velocity (Vmax) and Km parameters based on the Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee transformations of the Michaelis-Menten equation were related to the stromal and epithelial concentrations of dihydrotestosterone. On the basis of relative Vmax values, there was 6-15 times more 5 alpha-reductase activity in stroma than in epithelium regardless of the histology of the prostate. Stromal enzyme activity also was unique in having a 2- to 5-fold larger mean Km value and greater resistance to competitive and noncompetitive inhibition. Despite the enrichment of 5 alpha-reductase activity in stroma, the dihydrotestosterone concentrations in the stromal and epithelial fractions were very similar. In addition, similar concentrations were found in the stromal fractions of hyperplastic and carcinomatous tissues, notwithstanding a 4-fold difference in the mean Vmax values. This anomaly occurred in association with a large disparity in mean Km values, i.e. 68.3 +/- 1.6 (+/- SE) nmol/L in hyperplasia vs. 23.0 +/- 2.9 nmol/L in carcinoma. The dissociation between parameters of 5 alpha-reductase activity and tissue dihydrotestosterone concentrations was apparent to some extent in benign prostatic hyperplasia, in which the lowest stromal androgen concentrations were found in prostates with the largest Vmax and Km values; also, a rise in stromal Km was almost invariably associated with a proportional increase in Vmax (correlation coefficient = 0.95). These data strongly suggest that the stromal and epithelial forms of 5 alpha-reductase are separate isoenzymes, and that the excess of 5 alpha-reductase in stroma does not promote accumulation of an abnormal amount of dihydrotestosterone. They also imply that both the augmentation of 5 alpha-reductase activity in hyperplastic stroma and the condition of benign hyperplasia of the prostate are mutual consequences of a primary increase in Km.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this work was 2-fold. First, we sought to develop statistical criteria by which it could be established that the coincident occurrence of pulses of two different hormones exceeds that which would occur by chance alone, thereby suggesting that secretion of the two hormones is either coupled or controlled from a single source generator. Using computer simulations of uncoupled pulse generators operating at different frequencies, we were able to derive the appropriate statistical criteria and to apply them to achieve our second objective, to determine whether the occasional coincidence of plasma LH and serum PRL pulses that occurs throughout the menstrual cycle in normal women exceeds that which would happen by chance. The results of the computer simulations indicated that pulses emanating from two completely independent oscillators will occur coincidently at a predictable rate, despite the fact that the generator sources are not coupled; moreover, the rate of coincidence is increased when the pulse frequency of one of the source generators is increased. Using this knowledge and the statistical criteria we derived, we analyzed the coincidence of LH and PRL pulses in five normal women during their early follicular, late follicular, and midluteal phases and in another five women during their late luteal phase. We found that the number of PRL pulses that occurred coincidently with LH pulses consistently exceeded that which would be predicted if the two pulse generators were operating completely independently of one another; however, only during the late follicular and late luteal phases was the coincidence level between LH and PRL pulses sufficiently high in a sufficient number of women to conclude that there was coupling between the pulse sources. These studies suggest, first, that stringent and rigorous statistical criteria must be applied to the analysis of spontaneously coincident secretory phenomena before it can be deduced that two pulse generators are indeed coupled, and second, that the pulse generators governing the secretion of PRL and LH are probably coupled, at least during certain phases of the menstrual cycle.\r"

  ".W": "Lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by quantitative digital radiography, a new dual energy x-ray technique, and by 153Gd dual photon absorptiometry (DPA) in 85 patients. Each patient was measured twice by the new method and once by DPA on the same day, with repositioning between measurements. Serial measurements were made on an hydroxyapatite spine phantom embedded in tissue-equivalent plastic to evaluate the long term reproducibility of each instrument. The spinal BMD measurements with the 2 techniques were linearly related and highly correlated (r = 0.98) over a range from severely osteopenic to high normal. This correlation was not affected by the age, weight, or BMD of the patient measured. Quantitative digital radiography's long-term reproducibility using the spine phantom was stable for 180 days (coefficient of variation, 0.23%); DPA values were 3 times as variable for 170 days (coefficient of variation 0.73%) and increased 1.0% (P less than 0.0001) after a software change. The short term reproducibility of quantitative digital radiography, estimated from paired patient measurements, was 2-fold better than reported values for DPA and was independent of the patient's age, weight, or BMD. Measurement time by quantitative digital radiography was 5-8 min, with a maximum radiation exposure of 3 mrem, significantly lower than the corresponding DPA values. Quantitative digital radiography's image resolution was superior to that of DPA, enabling it to measure more bones. These advantages along with the elimination of 153Gd source changes and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing requirements indicate that quantitative digital radiography is the superior method for spinal BMD measurements.\r"

The concentrations of occupied and unoccupied receptor sites were determined by measuring total binding capacity at 0 and 22 C. At 0 C [125I]T3 was bound mainly to unoccupied sites, whereas at 22 C it was bound to unoccupied sites plus a fraction (70%) of endogenously occupied sites. Saturations of brain and lung receptors were similar (12-27%). From the fractional receptor occupancy and the receptor dissociation constants (34 pmol/L in brain and 56 pmol/L in lung) the concentration of intranuclear free T3 was calculated to be 9 pmol/L in brain and 11 pmol/L in lung. Total and free cytosolic T3 were measured by RIA and equilibrium dialysis. Total T3 was below the limit of detection in lung (90 pmol/L). The concentration of free T3 in brain cytosol was 0.95 pmol/L at 11 weeks and 2.96 pmol/L at 13 weeks, i.e. considerably lower than the nuclear free T3 concentration. These results suggest the presence of a small gradient (3-fold) between nuclear and cytosolic free T3 in both fetal tissues. The data strongly support the idea that thyroid hormones influence human brain development at least from the 9th to the 10th week of gestational age.\r"

H2O2 added extracellularly in micromolar concentrations (10-100 microM) induced DNA strand breaks in various target cells. The sensitivity of a specific target cell was inversely correlated to its catalase content and the rate of removal of H2O2 by the target cell. Oxidant species produced by xanthine oxidase/purine or phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated monocytes induced DNA breakage of target cells in proportion to the amount of H2O2 generated. These DNA strand breaks were prevented by extracellular catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. Cytotoxic doses of HOCl, added to target cells, did not induce DNA strand breakage, and myeloperoxidase added extracellularly in the presence of an H2O2-generating system, prevented the formation of DNA strand breaks in proportion to its H2O2 degrading capacity. The studies also indicated that H2O2 formed hydroxyl radical (.OH) intracellularly, which appeared to be the most likely free radical responsible for DNA damage: .OH was detected in cells exposed to H2O2; the DNA base, deoxyguanosine, was hydroxylated in cells exposed to H2O2; and intracellular iron was essential for induction of DNA strand breaks.\r"

We demonstrated two classes of membrane protein defects in unstable hemoglobin-containing cells (UH-RBCs), a defect of the spectrin-depleted inside-out vesicle (UH-IOV), and a defect of spectrin (UH-spectrin) itself. The composition of UH-IOVs is the same as control with respect to quantity of ankyrin and proportion inside-out. However, UH-IOVs bind even less spectrin than IOVs derived from sickle erythrocytes (SS-IOVs), suggesting a severe functional defect in the ankyrin of UH-RBCs (UH-ankyrin). Further evidence that UH-ankyrin is abnormal is demonstrated by the virtual absence of ankyrin in isotonic membrane shells of UH-RBCs (UH-shells), and abnormal mobility and decreased binding of the 72-kD (spectrin-binding) alpha-chymotryptic fragment of UH-ankyrin (UH-72-kD) to control spectrin. All UH-RBC membranes were spectrin-deficient (60% of control). In addition, spectrin isolated from UH-RBCs (UH-spectrin) was abnormal in two respects: (a) presence of a fast-moving band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels of both 0 degree C and 37 degrees C extracts, and (b) decreased binding to actin in the presence of protein 4.1. UH-spectrin did exhibit normal self-association, binding to IOVs and binding to actin in the absence of protein 4.1. This pattern of normal and abnormal spectrin functions has been described for spectrin subjected to mild diamide oxidation, suggesting the role of oxidation is the pathogenesis of membrane defect(s) of erythrocytes with abnormal hemoglobins.\r"

Achlorhydria was induced in rats by the gastric H+/K+ ATPase inhibitor, omeprazole (100 mumol/kg). This resulted in fourfold increases in both serum gastrin (within 2 h) and gastrin mRNA levels (after 24 h). Antral somatostatin D cells probably act as chemoreceptors for gastric acid to mediate a paracrine inhibition on gastrin secretion from adjacent G cells. Omeprazole-induced achlorhydria reduced D-cell activity as shown by a threefold decrease in antral somatostatin mRNA levels that began after 24 h. Exogenous administration of the somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 (10 micrograms/kg) prevented both the hypergastrinemia and the increase in gastrin mRNA levels caused by omeprazole-induced achlorhydria. Exogenous somatostatin, however, did not influence the decrease in antral somatostatin mRNA levels seen with achlorhydria. These data, therefore, support the hypothesis that antral D cells act as chemoreceptors for changes in gastric pH, and modulates somatostatin secretion and synthesis to mediate a paracrine inhibition on gastrin gene expression in adjacent G cells.\r"

We used an ear lobe model in rabbits, single intradermal injection of angiotropin to induce phenotypical changes of the endothelial cells in capillaries and postcapillary venules, vascular engorgement, and subsequent angiogenesis in dose-dependent manner. The vascular changes are associated with epidermal and stromal cell proliferation. Angiogenesis and tissue proliferation occur in the absence of tissue necrosis and do not lead to scar formation. Angiotropin-induced angiogenesis is not inhibited by local dexamethasone although it involves a defined turnover of inflammatory cells. Proliferation is transient and regressive events follow. The overall tissue reaction resembles changes found in the undamaged skin margin of a primary healing wound during the inflammatory/proliferative phase. From these observations we conclude that angiotropin is an important secretory product of activated peripheral macrophages that triggers inflammatory and proliferative reactions in wound healing by activating microvascular endothelial cells.\r"

After freezing and thawing to allow incorporation of macromolecules into the vesicles, the effect of Ca++/CaM on brush-border Na+ uptake with an acid inside pH gradient, and on Na+/H+ exchange was determined. Freezing and thawing vesicles with 0.85 microM free Ca++ plus 5 microM exogenous CaM failed to alter Na+/H+ exchange as did the addition of exogenous ATP plus an ATP regenerating system, which was sufficient to elevate intravesicular ATP to 47 microM from a basal level of 0.4 microM. However, the combination of Ca++/CaM plus ATP inhibited Na+ uptake in the presence of an acid inside pH gradient and inhibited Na+/H+ exchange, while Na+ uptake in the absence of a pH gradient was not altered. This effect required a hydrolyzable form of ATP, and did not occur when the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, replaced ATP. Under the identical intravesicular conditions used for the transport studies, Ca++ (0.85 microM) plus exogenous CaM (5 microM), in the presence of magnesium plus ATP, increased phosphorylation of five brush-border peptides. These data are consistent with Ca++/CaM acting via phosphorylation to regulate the ileal brush-border Na+/H+ exchanger.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of ischemic renal tubular cell injury involves a complex interaction of different processes, including membrane phospholipid alterations and depletion of high-energy phosphate stores. To assess the role of membrane phospholipid changes due to activation of phospholipases in renal tubule cell injury, suspensions enriched in rabbit renal proximal tubule segments were incubated with exogenous phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Exogenous PLA2 did not produce any significant change in various metabolic parameters reflective of cell injury in control nonhypoxic preparations despite a significant decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and moderate increases in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE). In contrast, exogenous PLA2 treatment of hypoxic tubules resulted in a severe degree of cell injury, as demonstrated by marked declines in tubule K+ and ATP contents and significant decreases in tubule uncoupled respiratory rates, and was associated with significant phospholipid alterations, including marked declines in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PE and significant rises in LPC, LPE, and free fatty acids (FFA). The injurious metabolic effects of exogenous PLA2 on hypoxic tubules were reversed by addition of ATP-MgCl2 to the tubules. The protective effect of ATP-MgCl2 was associated with increases in tubule PC and PE contents and declines in LPC, LPE, and FFA contents. These experiments thus indicate that an increase in exogenous PLA2 activity produces renal proximal tubule cell injury when cell ATP levels decline, at which point phospholipid resynthesis cannot keep pace with phospholipid degradation with resulting depletion of phospholipids and accumulation of lipid by-products. High-energy phosphate store depletion appears to be an important condition for exogenous PLA2 activity to induce renal tubule cell injury.\r"

Furthermore, fasting postheparin plasma LPL activity during a heparin infusion, showed an even stronger inverse correlation to plasma estradiol when measured at 60 min (r = -0.815; P less than 0.001). None of the above parameters was correlated to the body mass index. Postprandial LPL activity in postheparin plasma, measured 10 min after a heparin injection, showed a strong positive correlation with plasma free testosterone (r = 0.780; P = 0.001). Neither of these parameters was correlated with the body mass index. The origin of this LPL activity is presently unknown but could conceivably represent a pool of LPL from skeletal muscle. Since it has been shown convincingly that estrogen decreases adipose tissue LPL activity in the rat, the present studies strongly suggest that estradiol is a major negative regulator of fasting adipose tissue LPL activity in women.\r"

This microsomal uptake of nucleotide sugar was time and temperature dependent. Analysis of the molecular species containing radiolabel revealed that initial uptake represented entry of predominantly intact UDPGlc in the microsomes. Conclusive evidence for proper translocation of UDPGlc across the microsomal membrane into the intravesicular space was obtained by demonstrating that UDPGlc was transported into an osmotically sensitive compartment. Microsomal uptake of UDPGlc exhibited features characteristic of carrier-mediated transport including saturation, specificity, and countertransport. Inhibition and trans-stimulation studies showed that other uridine-containing nucleotide sugars and 5'-UMP were substrates of the postulated microsomal carrier system for UDPGlc, while cytosine- or guanosine-containing nucleotides and non-5'-uridine monophosphates were, at best, very poor substrates. UDPGlc translocation activities were lower in smooth microsomal fractions than in the RER-derived vesicles, indicating that contamination with Golgi membranes could not be responsible for microsomal transport of UDPGlc. Our findings suggest that rat liver endoplasmic reticulum possesses a carrier system mediating proper translocation of UDPGlc and 5'-uridine-substituted structural analogues across the membrane.\r"

In this report, we have analyzed the cellular properties of red cells from homozygous beta-thalassemic mice (Hbbth-1/Hbbth-1), homozygous beta-thalassemic transgenic mice containing a human beta-sickle (beta s) gene (Hbbth-1/Hbbth-1 + beta s), and normal animals. The presence of human beta s-globin chains in red cells from the Hbbth-1/Hbbth-1 + beta s transgenic animals was noted to have a significant effect on cellular deformability and density distribution, as well as on the degree of anemia in these animals. We conclude from these studies that red cell deformability and density distribution is a sensitive means for assessing at the cellular level the effects of globin genes genetically introduced into whole organisms. In addition, these studies suggest that small decreases in the amount of excess alpha-globin chains can significantly ameliorate the severity of anemia in the beta-thalassemic mouse.\r"

In this report, a novel mechanism for mediation of this synergistic interaction is described in rat thyroid (FRTL-5) cells. Because phorbol myristate acetate stimulates DNA synthesis, the effects of TSH, IGF-1 and insulin on FRTL-5 cell content of 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DG), the endogenous activator of protein kinase C, were measured. After 6 d, TSH, IGF-1 and insulin caused increases in cellular 1,2-DG (mean +/- SE) to 180 +/- 10%, 540 +/- 50%, and 360 +/- 40% of control, respectively, whereas TSH plus IGF-1 and TSH plus insulin synergistically increased 1,2-DG to 1,890 +/- 310% and 1,690 +/- 230%, respectively. In the absence of insulin, the effect of TSH to elevate 1,2-DG exhibited an EC50 of approximately 2,000 microU/ml. The synergistic interaction of insulin and TSH was found to increase the potency of TSH by 300-fold (EC50 was approximately 7 microU/ml) in addition to increasing the efficacy of TSH. The effect of TSH appeared to be mediated by TSH-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP (cAMP). Forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, like TSH, caused modest increases in 1,2-DG and DNA synthesis, whereas forskolin plus insulin and 8-bromo-cAMP plus insulin markedly elevated 1,2-DG content and stimulated DNA synthesis. Under all conditions, increases in 1,2-DG content correlated with stimulation of DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that the synergistic stimulation of DNA synthesis in thyroid cells by TSH, via cAMP, and IGF-1 is mediated by 1,2-DG. Moreover, they implicate a novel interaction between the lipid and adenylyl cyclase signaling systems for the regulation of cell proliferation.\r"

The plasma clearance of intravenously injected 125I-labeled and unlabeled human EC-SOD C was studied in rabbits. About 90% of injected 125I-EC-SOD C was eliminated from the blood within 5-10 min. Injection of heparin after 10 or 20 min led to an immediate release of all sequestered 125I-EC-SOD C back to the blood plasma. Later injections of heparin led to diminished release, although release could still be demonstrated after 72 h. A half-time of approximately 10 h could be calculated for heparin-releasable 125I-EC-SOD C. Unlabeled EC-SOD C, determined as enzymic activity and with ELISA, was likewise sequestered and released to the same degree as 125I-labeled EC-SOD C by heparin as tested at 20 min and 5 h. The immediacy of the heparin-induced release indicates that the sequestered enzyme had been bound to endothelial cell surfaces. The length of the half-time suggests that the putative cell surface binding has a physiological function and is not primarily a step in enzyme degradation. The distribution of sequestered 125I-labeled EC-SOD C to different organs was determined at times between 10 min and 24 h. Of the organs, the liver contained the most 125I-EC-SOD C, followed by kidney, spleen, heart, and lung. At all investigated times, the content in the analyzed organs was nearly as large as the amount that could be promptly released to plasma by intravenous heparin. This indicates that almost all 125I-EC-SOD C in the organs was present on endothelial cell surfaces and was not bound by other tissue cell surfaces, or was present within the cells.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the relationship between impaired fatty acid oxidation and the pathogenesis of Reye syndrome. We present a hypothesis proposing that many clinical signs of this childhood disease are caused by accumulation of unusual acyl CoA esters, precursors to deacylated metabolites found in the patients' blood and urine. A new method was developed to measure acyl CoA compounds in small human liver biopsy samples, offering several advantages over previous techniques. A major finding was an accumulation in Reye syndrome patients of short- and medium-chain acyl CoA intermediates of fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid oxidation. These metabolites included octanoyl, isovaleryl, butyryl, isobutyryl, propionyl, and methylmalonyl CoA esters. The findings were explained in a model of hepatic fatty acid oxidation involving three interrelated pathways: mitochondrial beta-oxidation, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and omega-oxidation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results suggest that pathogenesis in Reye syndrome stems from generalized mitochondrial damage resulting in accumulation of acyl CoA esters. High levels of these compounds lead to inhibition of mitochondrial pathways for ureogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. The inhibited pathways, in turn, could cause the hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, and hypoketonemia observed in patients. The model also explains underlying biochemical differences between patients with Reye syndrome and medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, another disorder of fatty acid metabolism. Acetyl CoA levels, in the latter disease, were dramatically decreased, compared with both human controls and Reye syndrome patients.\r"

Neutrophils and tumor cells were incubated (a) as a suspension with continuous mixing to maximize the availability of oxygen or (b) after centrifugation as a pellet to maximize cell-cell contact. The cells were then incubated briefly as a suspension with [14C]glutamine under conditions that blocked further damage to the tumor cells. When cells were incubated as a suspension, inhibition of tumor-cell glutamine uptake was mediated by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system of stimulated neutrophils. Inhibition was blocked by adding catalase, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, or compounds that scavenge hypochlorous acid or chloramines. When cells were incubated as a pellet, a portion of the inhibition could not be blocked in this way, indicating that a nonoxidative mechanism contributed to inhibition. In both systems, inhibition of glutamine uptake was rapid and was obtained at effector-cell/target-cell ratios as low as 0.5:1. This inhibition was obtained under conditions that did not result in 51Cr release from cells labeled with [51Cr]-chromate, indicating that inhibition of glutamine uptake measured cytotoxicity rather than cytolysis. 51Cr release was observed only when cells were incubated together for an hour or more as a pellet at high E/T ratios. This cytolysis was mediated by the myeloperoxidase system, and a nonoxidative contribution to cytolysis was not observed. The results indicate that stimulated neutrophils are potent antitumor effectors cells when cytotoxicity rather than cytolysis is the measure of activity. Because glutamine is required for growth of many tumor cells, inhibition of glutamine uptake may represent a significant tumoristatic or tumoricidal effect.\r"

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the gene coding for apo B were identified using the endonucleases Xba I, Eco RI, and Msp I in a group of 19 subjects with moderate hyperlipidemia. There was a significant association between the Xba I polymorphism and the total fractional clearance rate (FCR) of LDL. The individuals with the X1X1 genotype had, on average, a 22% higher FCR (P less than 0.025) than those with the genotype X2X2 (X2 allele = presence of Xba I cutting site). This difference was attributable to increased clearance by the receptor-mediated pathway of LDL catabolism. In this group of subjects, there was no association of LDL kinetic parameters and RFLPs of the LDL receptor gene or the AI- CIII- AIV gene cluster. The data suggest that variation in apo B itself, presumably acting through variable binding to the LDL receptor, makes a significant contribution to the rate of catabolism of LDL.\r"

The regulation of GRP gene expression appears to be at the level of primary transcription based on nuclear run on studies. In the two SCLC cell lines expressing GRP we find a single transcription start site for GRP mRNA, and near this site we find four DNase I hypersensitive sites. These hypersensitive sites are absent in the two cell lines that do not express GRP. The presence of DNase hypersensitive sites in the promoter region of the GRP gene is the structural feature that best correlates with transcriptional activation. These four DNase hypersensitive sites are candidates for cis acting regulatory regions, which may be important in determining the level of transcription of the human prepro GRP gene.\r"

  ".W": "Recent reports using anesthetized ventilator-dependent animal models, have suggested that in certain shock states, a disparity exists between arterial and mixed venous blood gases with regard to acid-base status and oxygenation. In a chronically instrumented unanesthetized canine model of acute cardiac tamponade breathing room air, we studied the effect of a graded decline in cardiac output on arterial and mixed venous pH, PCO2, and PO2. Cardiac tamponade resulted in a profound arterial respiratory alkalosis, whereas mixed venous pH, PCO2, and calculated serum bicarbonate levels remained relatively unchanged. As intrapericardial pressure increased and cardiac output declined, the difference between arterial and mixed venous PCO2 progressively increased. Further, whereas arterial oxygenation improved as cardiac output declined, mixed venous oxygenation steadily worsened. This disparity began early in cardiac tamponade (reductions in cardiac output of 20-40%) long before arterial blood pressure began to fall and progressively worsened as hemodynamic deterioration and lactic acidosis developed. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in blood flow, resulting in decreased CO2 delivery to the lungs, is the primary mechanism responsible for the difference in pH and PCO2 observed between arterial and mixed venous blood. In this conscious, spontaneously breathing animal model, mixed venous blood gases thus are superior to arterial blood gases in assessing acid-base status and oxygenation, even early in acute cardiac tamponade when the decline in cardiac output is in the range of 20 to 40% and arterial blood pressure has not changed significantly.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether Cl- is transported via transcellular pathways in the thin ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL), conventional microelectrode technique was applied in isolated TAL segments of hamsters perfused in vitro. The average basolateral membrane voltage (VB) was -24.5 +/- 1.5 mV (n = 18). Ouabain (10(-4) M) had no effect on VB. Sudden reduction of basolateral Cl- concentration from 165 to 5 mmol/liter caused a large depolarizing spike (+49.1 +/- 2.7 mV, n = 18), while the transepithelial potential (VT) showed lumen positive deflection by 33.4 +/- 1.2 mV, which indicates that a large Cl- conductance exists in the basolateral membrane. Reduction of luminal Cl- concentration caused sustained depolarization of luminal cell membrane from +24.5 +/- 2.1 to -9.7 +/- 3.4 mV (n = 6), which indicates that there is also a Cl- conductance in the luminal membrane. Since we have previously shown that acidification of ambient solution suppresses the transmural Cl- permeability, we tested whether acid pH also inhibits the Cl- conductance of the basolateral membrane. When pH of the bathing fluid was lowered to 5.8, the depolarizing spike of VB and the change of VT upon sudden reduction of basolateral Cl- were almost completely abolished. From these results we conclude: (a) both the luminal and the basolateral membrane of hamster TAL segments have Cl- conductances, and (b) Cl- transport in the TAL takes place, at least in part, via a transcellular route when a transepithelial Cl- gradient is present.\r"

Treatment of narcoleptic dogs with 25-600 micrograms/kg prazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, exacerbated cataplexy, whereas treatment with the alpha-1 agonist, methoxamine, ameliorated it. Subsequent studies showed that the beneficial effects of classical treatments of human narcolepsy (amphetamines and tricyclic antidepressants) are antagonized by prazosin, suggesting that these drugs are active through an indirect alpha-1 stimulation (via an increase of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft). Other studies confirmed that the observed effects were not due to peripheral alpha-1 cardiovascular involvement. Atropine, a central anticholinergic agent, but not methylatropine, a peripheral one, completely suppressed the prazosin effect, which suggests that adrenergic and cholinergic systems act sequentially and not independently to generate cataplexy. Little is known about the physiological role of central alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This series of experiments implicates these receptors in narcolepsy-cataplexy.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular calcium overload figures prominently in the pathogenesis of the contractile dysfunction observed after brief periods of ischemia (myocardial stunning). Because acidosis is known to antagonize Ca influx and the intracellular binding of Ca, we reasoned that acidosis during reperfusion might prevent Ca overload and ameliorate functional recovery. We measured developed pressure (DP) and 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra in 26 isovolumic Langendorff-perfused ferret hearts. After 15 min of global ischemia, hearts were reperfused either with normal solution (2 mM [Ca]o, Hepes-buffered, pH 7.4 bubbled with 100% O2; n = 6) or with acidic solutions (pH 6.6 during 0-3 min, pH 7.0 during 4-6 min) before returning to the normal perfusate (n = 7). Ventricular function after 30 min of reperfusion was much greater in the acidic group (105 +/- 5 mmHg at 2 mM [Ca]o) than in the unmodified reperfusion group (79 +/- 7 mmHg, P less than 0.001); similar differences in DP were found over a broad range of [Ca]o (0.5-5 mM, P less than 0.001) and during maximal Ca2+ activation (P less than 0.001). Intramyocardial pH (pHi) was lower in the acidic group than in the unmodified group during early reperfusion, but not at steady state. Phosphate compounds were comparable in both groups. To clarify whether the protective effect of acidosis is due to intracellular or extracellular pH, we produced selective intracellular acidosis during early reperfusion by exposure to 10 mM NH4Cl for 6 min just before ischemia (n = 6). For the first 12 min of reperfusion with NH4Cl-free solution (pH = 7.4), pHi was decreased relative to the unmodified group. Recovery of DP was practically complete, and maximal Ca2+-activated pressure was comparable to that in a nonischemic control group (n = 5). These results indicate that transient intracellular acidosis can prevent myocardial stunning, presumably owing to a reduction of Ca influx into cells and/or competition of H+ for intracellular Ca2+ binding sites during early reperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "Using a new method for long-term recording of monophasic action potentials from the human heart, we studied in 17 patients the effects on ventricular action potential duration (APD) of three clinically pertinent cycle length perturbations: (1) single extrastimuli, (2) abrupt sustained rate acceleration and deceleration, and (3) different steady-state cycle lengths. Results were: (a) APD after single extrastimuli at progressively longer cycle lengths were related to the extrastimulus cycle length with a biphasic electrical restitution curve which after an initial steep rise and a subsequent transient descent rose again more gradually to a plateau at cycle lengths above 800-1,000 ms. (b) After a sustained step decrease in cycle length, the first APD shortened abruptly while final steady-state adaptation required up to several minutes. The transition between the rapid and slow phase of APD change was characterized by a variable alternans of APD which correlated inversely with the preceding diastolic interval. (c) In the steady state, APD correlated linearly with cycle length, increasing an average of 23 ms per 100 ms cycle length increase (r = 0.995). The divergence between steady-state and non-steady-state APD, and the slowness of steady-state adaptation, are important factors to be considered in clinical electrophysiologic studies and in rate correction algorithms of APD or QT intervals, respectively.\r"

Uptake of hypoxanthine and accumulation of inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP) were markedly increased at acid pH, high external phosphate concentrations, and low PO2. Release of accumulated IMP as hypoxanthine occurred at alkaline pH values and low external phosphate concentrations. Conditions favoring IMP accumulation gave rise, in the absence of hypoxanthine, to a corresponding increase in 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Intracellular phosphate concentrations were markedly pH dependent and a model is presented whereby hypoxanthine uptake and release are controlled by intracellular concentrations of inorganic phosphate and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. These allosteric effectors influence, in opposing ways, two enzymes governing IMP accumulation, namely 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase and 5'-nucleotidase. These metabolic properties suggest that the erythrocyte could play a role in the removal of hypoxanthine from anoxic tissue.\r"

Of the 46 patients, 27 (58.5%) responded early to intravenous amiodarone and 6 (13%) showed a late response to amiodarone. The majority of patients who responded to intravenous amiodarone did so within the first 2 h of therapy, and all responded within 84 h. Patients with an ejection fraction greater than 25% were more likely to respond (p less than 0.05). Major side effects occurred in 13% of patients. The cumulative 2 year mortality rate due to arrhythmia recurrence or sudden death for responders discharged from the hospital was 23% and the cumulative overall 2 year mortality rate was 46%. In conclusion, intravenous amiodarone is rapidly effective in the majority of patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation refractory to other drugs. The poor long-term outcome of patients who require this therapy, respond to it and are discharged on long-term oral amiodarone therapy warrants consideration of other long-term treatment of these patients. Use of intravenous amiodarone is an important new modality in the treatment of drug-refractory malignant ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

Although the recommended dose of this drug is 40 mg every 6 h, failure to respond to this dose has been observed in many patients with heart failure. In the present study the incidence of resistance to isosorbide dinitrate was evaluated and an attempt was made to identify baseline hemodynamic predictors for this phenomenon in 50 patients with severe chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 0.23 +/- 0.08). Twenty-seven (54%) of the 50 patients responded to 40 mg of isosorbide dinitrate (greater than 20% decrease in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure sustained greater than or equal to 1 h) and 23 patients (46%) failed to respond. Nonresponders to 40 mg of isosorbide dinitrate had a significantly higher baseline right atrial pressure than did responders (14 +/- 5 versus 10 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.02). In addition, all 7 patients with a baseline right atrial pressure of less than 7 mm Hg and 12 of 14 patients with a baseline right atrial pressure less than 10 mm Hg responded to 40 mg. No significant differences were noted between responders and nonresponders in any other baseline hemodynamic or clinical variables, or in peak isosorbide dinitrate serum levels (32 +/- 19 ng/ml in nonresponders versus 44 +/- 36 ng/ml in responders).

Alternatively, reperfusion of injured myocardium may cause intramyocardial hemorrhage with resultant increased stiffness causing a dyskinetic segment to become akinetic, thus improving ejection fraction without concomitant myocardial salvage. To evaluate this possibility, diastolic stiffness was assessed in a closed chest, anesthetized, normothermic dog model immediately after a 1 or 3 h occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and during the 4 weeks after occlusion. Acute myocardial infarction in experimental dogs was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the chamber stiffness constant, a threefold increase in the myocardial stiffness constant and a significant increase in elastic stiffness and end-diastolic pressure. These changes occurred contemporaneously with a marked decline in ejection fraction. Early reperfusion (1 h occlusion) resulted in improvement of the ejection fraction accompanied by simultaneous resolution of the previously increased stiffness. Late reperfusion (3 h occlusion) resulted in permanent depression of ejection fraction with permanent elevation of stiffness. These results indicate that the improved systolic function observed after early reperfusion reflects a process other than increased stiffness, perhaps salvage of jeopardized myocardium.\r"

It was hypothesized that because 5% human albumin, when sonicated for use as a contrast agent, is neither hyperosmolar nor a calcium chelator, it would not have significant effects on coronary blood flow, left ventricular function or systemic hemodynamics. Albumin microbubbles of two distinct sizes (mean size 2.9 and 5.8 micron) were produced and compared with nonsonicated albumin, nonsonicated Renografin, sonicated Renografin and hand-agitated Renografin for their effects on hemodynamics, coronary blood flow and regional left ventricular systolic thickening in 15 open chest anesthetized dogs. None of the albumin solutions significantly altered left atrial, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic and mean aortic pressures. These agents did not cause a coronary hyperemic response or alter left ventricular systolic thickening, but slightly lowered the peak positive left ventricular maximal rate of rise in pressure (dP/dt) (-4.1 +/- 5.4%, p less than 0.01). In contrast, all the Renografin solutions caused significant changes in all these variables (p less than 0.02). In six dogs. albumin solutions did not alter these variables even in the presence of critical coronary stenosis. The contrast opacification produced by 5.8 micron albumin microbubbles was equivalent to that produced by sonicated Renografin. Compared with an equivalent amount of saline and nonsonicated albumin solutions, 10 ml of sonicated albumin did not produce any evidence of infarction, embolization or hemorrhage in the myocardium, brain or kidneys of rabbits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the effects of dose and the time of administration and the relation of the extent of the region of enhancement to the myocardial bed at risk have not been evaluated. In this study, dogs were given Gd-DTPA (0.1 mM/kg body weight [n = 21] or 0.34 mM/kg [n = 7]) or saline solution (n = 5) after various periods of occlusion and reperfusion. Twenty-five dogs were killed after 1 or 2 h of reperfusion and the excised hearts were imaged. Images were analyzed for presence, intensity and extent of a region of increased signal. All images in dogs given Gd-DTPA had easily identifiable regions of increased signal in the distribution of the reperfused myocardial bed. Analysis of the extent of these regions in spin-echo images of excised hearts when Gd-DTPA was administered after 5 min of reperfusion demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.72 with the bed at risk as determined postmortem with a dye perfusion technique. These images consistently overestimated the infarct size. Signal intensity of the reperfused myocardium increased to a maximum of 1.67 times control (p less than 0.05) in spin-lattice relaxation time (T1)-weighted sequences as the dose of Gd-DTPA increased. This was due to a higher concentration of Gd-DTPA in the reperfused myocardium with resultant shortening of the T1 relaxation time. When Gd-DTPA was given after 90 min of reperfusion, NMR images did not identify the bed at risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this group the effect of intracoronary diltiazem (2 to 3 mg) on luminal area was evaluated in normal and stenotic segments of epicardial coronary arteries during symptom-limited supine exercise. The luminal area of a normal and a stenotic coronary artery segment was determined by quantitative coronary arteriography with a computer-assisted system. Patients were studied at rest, 6 min after 2 to 3 mg of intracoronary diltiazem, during supine bicycle exercise (96 W) and 5 min after sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin. Heart rate, mean pulmonary and aortic pressure as well as the percent change of both normal and stenotic luminal area were determined. Intracoronary administration of diltiazem was associated with mild dilation of both normal (19%, p less than 0.01) and stenotic coronary luminal area (11%, p less than 0.05). During subsequent exercise, luminal area of the stenotic vessel segment increased by 23% (p less than 0.001) and that of the normal vessel segment by 24% (p less than 0.001), whereas in a previously reported control group, luminal area of the stenotic vessel segment decreased by 29% during exercise. After sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, the luminal area of both the normal and the stenotic vessel segment increased further by 19% (p less than 0.01) and 22% (p less than 0.01), respectively, compared with the values after intracoronary administration of diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of sufficient inhalation of this compound to gradually produce a level of 6% carboxyhemoglobin was studied in 30 nonsmoking patients with obstructive coronary artery disease and evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. After an initial training session, subjects were exposed to air or carbon monoxide on successive days in a randomized double-blind crossover fashion. Cardiac function and exercise capacity were assessed during symptom-limited supine radionuclide ventriculography. On the carbon monoxide day, mean postexposure carboxyhemoglobin was 5.9 +/- 0.1% compared with 1.6 +/- 0.1% (p less than 0.01) after air exposure. The mean duration of exercise was significantly longer after air compared with carbon monoxide exposure (626 +/- 50 s for air versus 585 +/- 49 s for carbon monoxide, p less than 0.05). Actuarial methods suggested that subjects were likely to experience angina earlier during exercise on the day of carbon monoxide exposure (p less than 0.05). Both the level (62 +/- 2.4 versus 60 +/- 2.4%, p = 0.05) and change in left ventricular ejection fraction at submaximal exercise (1.6 +/- 1.6 versus -1.2 +/- 1.6%, p = 0.05) were greater on the air exposure day compared with the carbon monoxide day. The peak exercise left ventricular ejection fraction was not different for the two exposures (57 +/- 2.5% for both). These results demonstrate earlier onset of ventricular dysfunction, angina and poorer exercise performance in patients with ischemic heart disease after acute carbon monoxide exposure sufficient to increase blood carboxyhemoglobin to 6%.\r"

False tendons were demonstrated echocardiographically in 133 (71%). Eight subjects were withdrawn from the study because of silent mitral valve prolapse. In these 179 healthy subjects, false tendons were detected in 127 (71%) and premature ventricular complexes in 48 (27%). Their coexistence was observed in 40, which showed a significant correlation (p less than 0.05) of false tendons and premature ventricular complexes. In seven of the eight subjects without false tendons, premature ventricular complexes were uniform and infrequent (mean 3 beats/24 h). In the 40 subjects with false tendons, premature ventricular complexes were uniform in 29, multiform in 6 and repetitive in 5, and the mean frequency was 96 beats/24 h. Correlation of premature ventricular complexes with the type of false tendons showed that premature ventricular complexes were significantly associated with thick (greater than or equal to 2 mm) and longitudinal tendons (p less than 0.005). Although it is not certain that left ventricular false tendons are arrhythmogenic, the prevalence of the coexistence of left ventricular false tendons and premature ventricular complexes in the general population, and the special relation between the frequency and the form of premature ventricular complexes and the type of false tendons, suggests that false tendons may play an etiologic role in the genesis of premature ventricular complexes in apparently healthy subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that myocardial contrast echocardiography could be used to simultaneously assess coronary blood flow reserve and the size of the perfusion bed supplied by a coronary artery was examined in nine patients and six dogs. All patients were undergoing cardiac catheterization and had single vessel coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 85% stenosis of either the proximal left anterior descending or the left circumflex coronary artery); the six dogs had a critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. Three milliliters of sonicated Renografin-76 (mean microbubble size 6 micron) was injected into the left main coronary artery before and after intracoronary administration of papavarine, 6 to 9 mg. The beds supplied by the normal and stenotic vessels could not be differentiated during contrast echocardiography before injection of papavarine. However, after papavarine, the normal vascular bed showed significantly more contrast enhancement than did the bed supplied by the stenotic artery. This disparity in contrast enhancement made it possible to delineate the size of the bed perfused by the stenotic vessels. When quantitative analysis of the time-intensity curves obtained from the echocardiograms was performed in the dogs, the absolute values for the area under the curve, peak contrast intensity and curve width did not correlate with absolute blood flows measured with radiolabeled microspheres. However, the ratios of the areas under the curves derived from the two vascular beds before and after papavarine correlated well with the ratios of blood flows between the two beds during the same stages (r2 = 0.73 by linear regression and r2 = 0.85 by an exponential function). In comparison, the ratios of peak amplitudes and curve widths before and after papavarine had poor correlations with ratios of flows from the two beds (r2 = 0.18 and 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to simultaneously assess coronary blood flow reserve and the size of the perfusion bed supplied by a stenotic vessel.\r"

  ".U": "88331624\r", 
  ".W": "The noninvasive measurement of left ventricular filling has relied predominantly on radionuclide-derived peak filling rate normalized to end-diastolic volume. Doppler echocardiography also has the ability to measure peak filling rate, but wide application of this technique has been limited by technical errors involved in quantitative echocardiographic determination of mitral anulus cross-sectional area and ventricular volumes. For Doppler echocardiography, normalization of peak filling rate to mitral stroke volume rather than end-diastolic volume permits the derivation of a diastolic filling index that is relatively free of errors caused by geometric assumptions, diameter measurements and sample volume positioning. This normalization process can be achieved by simply dividing early peak filling velocity by the time velocity integral of mitral inflow. To validate this new Doppler echocardiographic filling index, Doppler echocardiographic and radionuclide-derived peak filling rate, both normalized to mitral stroke volume, were compared in 30 patients; there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.91, SEE = 0.88). This variable was not influenced by the position of the sample volume in relation to the mitral apparatus in contrast to early filling velocity, which increased 37%, and early/late filling (E/A) ratio, which increased 43% as the sample volume was moved from the anulus to the tips of the mitral leaflets. In a cohort of 22 normal patients, the mean peak filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume (SV) was 5.25 +/- 1.47 SV/s. The mean peak filling rate for a subgroup of eight normal patients aged 57 to 89 years (mean 71 +/- 9) was 3.9 +/- 1 SV/s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sixteen patients, none with a diagnosis of aortic valve disease, were examined just before undergoing open heart surgery. Parabolic velocity patterns were always found, and it was determined that the parabola was skewed rightward toward the anterior wall. Furthermore, it was shown that the flow velocity vector was initially directed toward the commissure of the right coronary and the noncoronary cusps.\r"

The criteria consist of one obligatory criterion (age less than or equal to 40 years), two major criteria (left and right mid subclavian artery lesions) and nine minor criteria (high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, common carotid artery tenderness, hypertension, aortic regurgitation or annuloaortic ectasia and lesions of the pulmonary artery, left mid common carotid artery, distal brachiocephalic trunk, thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta). In addition to the obligatory criterion, the presence of two major criteria or of one major plus two or more minor criteria, or of four or more minor criteria suggests a high probability of the presence of Takayasu's disease. The criteria had an 84% sensitivity in 96 patients with this disease: 52 (96%) of 54 patients in the active young group, 8 (80%) of 10 in the active older group, 14 (67%) of 21 in the inactive young group and 7 (64%) of 11 in the inactive older group fulfilled the criteria; however, none of the 12 patients with other aortic diseases did so. Use of these criteria has shortened the delay of an accurate diagnosis in patients with Takayasu's disease.\r"

All underwent electrophysiologic study with a uniform protocol when they were not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. A ventricular tachyarrhythmia (sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) was induced in 113 patients (75%). The strongest correlates of inducing a tachyarrhythmia were male gender (p less than 0.0001) and a history of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.0001). Induction of sustained monomorphic tachycardia alone was also strongly related to gender and prior infarction; in particular, none of 26 women without prior infarction had induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Among patients with induced sustained tachyarrhythmias, those with induced monomorphic ventricular tachycardia were distinguished from those with induced ventricular fibrillation in they were more likely to have coronary artery disease (p = 0.0001), healed myocardial infarction (p = 0.0002), left ventricular aneurysm (p = 0.0007) and ventricular tachycardia documented at the time of cardiac arrest (p = 0.02). Other variables showing significant correlations with arrhythmia inducibility were ejection fraction, documentation of ventricular tachycardia at the time of cardiac arrest and presence of an intraventricular conduction delay. However, stepwise logistic regression identified male gender and healed myocardial infarction as the only independent predictors of arrhythmia inducibility. On the basis of these two variables alone, arrhythmia inducibility or noninducibility could be correctly predicted in 89% of the patients in this series.\r"

Measurements of left ventricular structure and systolic and diastolic function were made in the study patients and compared with those of age-matched control subjects. The study group had significantly greater left ventricular mass, wall thickness, shortening fraction and relative wall thickness than did the control subjects. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was smaller and left atrial size was not different in study patients compared with control subjects. Left ventricular filling was characterized by an increased peak atrial velocity and reduced ratio of peak early to peak atrial velocity in the study group. Left ventricular outflow velocities were elevated in 14 of the 17 study patients with peak velocities ranging from 1.2 to 5.0 m/s corresponding to a peak intraventricular gradient of 16 to 100 mm Hg. The velocity waveforms in these patients were late-peaking, similar to those described in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. The elevated velocities were localized to the left ventricular outflow tract. These findings imply a pathophysiologic state in these elderly patients with long-standing hypertension, very similar to that in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and provide further support for the use of pharmacologic agents with negative inotropic properties or positive lusitropic properties in this group.\r"

Accordingly, echocardiographic left ventricular mass in unmedicated employed adults (162 normotensive, 145 borderline hypertension and 317 with established essential hypertension) was related to height, weight, lean body mass, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, gender, race and 24 h urinary sodium and potassium excretion. In the total population, body mass index, systolic blood pressure and height were the most significant (p less than 0.0001) independent correlates of left ventricular mass, whereas gender and age made smaller contributions. In each normotensive and hypertensive subgroup, body mass index and height remained highly significant independent predictors of left ventricular mass, systolic blood pressure became a weaker predictor (0.001 less than p less than 0.02) and only among patients with established hypertension was diastolic blood pressure a weak independent determinant (p less than 0.05) of ventricular mass. The increase in left ventricular mass attributable to obesity was due to eccentric hypertrophy because end-diastolic relative wall thickness was similar in obese and nonobese subjects in each blood pressure group. Thus obesity, as measured by body mass index, is as important a potential determinant of left ventricular muscle mass as is systolic blood pressure and it is of greater statistical significant in an adult employed population than is diastolic blood pressure, height, gender, age or dietary sodium intake.\r"

In the previous 5 years, 67.3% had written proposals and served as principal investigator for at least one study, and 58% had received research funding. Half had written research papers, and 65% had written other publications. Only 60.2% had presented research papers, but 74.8% had given other types of presentations. Nearly 75% of educators indicated interest in collaborative studies; more than half reported a need for skills in getting funded, generating statistics, and writing research protocols. Most educators had a personal interest in research, had access to computers, and agreed that research was both rewarded and essential for academic advancement. Only 15.2% agreed that research was financially or administratively supported, and 22.8% said that they were confused about the relative importance of research in relation to teaching and service.

On the average, estimates of phosphorus content deviated from actual by approximately 250 mg/day. Diets with a greater proportion of processed, convenience, or restaurant foods deviated by more than 350 mg/day. Our findings suggest that estimates of calcium intake calculated from available food composition tables are within an acceptable range of error; however, phosphorus intake is significantly underestimated by 15% to 25% of the actual level. For accurate calculation of phosphorus content, nutrient composition sources must be updated to reflect present industrial use of phosphate-containing additives.\r"

The study population included 51 whites, of whom 21 were participants in the Food Stamp program, and 51 blacks, of whom 29 were Food Stamp program participants. The mean age of white and black mothers was approximately 29 years. Mean numbers of children per family were 2.1 for whites and 2.82 for blacks. Food and nutrient intake data were collected using a 24-hour recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Mean intakes of calcium, iron, riboflavin, and thiamin were found to be less than the RDAs for both groups. Whites additionally had mean intakes of vitamin A and niacin that fell below the RDAs. Blacks had significantly higher mean intakes of niacin and protein and a significantly higher 24-hour mean intake of soft drinks than whites. Being a member of the black race was positively associated with consumption of chicken, hot dogs, collard/mustard greens, and white rice. Being a member of the white race was positively associated with consumption of broccoli, potatoes, and whole wheat bread. Among participants in the Food Stamp program, mean intakes of protein, niacin, and soft drinks were significantly higher for blacks than for whites. This study suggests that ethnic differences in food preferences do exist but that those preferences do not translate into major differences in daily reported nutrient intakes.\r"

  ".W": "Graduates from three coordinated dietetics programs who had participated in a research project in which a death education curriculum unit for dietetic students was developed, implemented, and evaluated, were mailed questionnaires to ask their opinion of their undergraduate preparation to work with terminally/seriously ill clients. Graduates agreed that including death education was important in their preparation as dietitians and suggested expanding the topics. For the subjects in this sample, neither death education as a student nor work experience with the dying since graduation has changed their attitude score on three scales: Death Fear, Disengagement from Death Fear, and Dietetic Attitude. Although this is a very small sample, the findings suggest that attitudes about death and working with the dying are resistant to change. Members of this group, both as students and as graduates, indicated that the unit was helpful to them in doing what they perceive as a difficult part of their job. This project suggests that developing support systems for students in their clinical experience and for professional dietitians to help manage the stress of working with seriously and terminally ill clients should be one of the goals of death education rather than trying to change attitudes toward death on either a pre-service or an in-service basis.\r"

The proteolytic capacity of the perfused liver of ad libitum fed animals increased from 3 to 6 months of age and then declined linearly through 24 months of age. Food restriction had no effect at 3 months of age (6 weeks of food restriction), but by 6 months of age the proteolytic capacity was approximately 25% greater than that of the liver of ad libitum fed animals; this increment was increased through 24 months of age. Therefore, food restriction, while not preventing the age-related decline in protein degradation, did produce a greater proteolytic capacity at any age from 6 months on.\r"

Food restriction had no significant effect on gut calcium absorption, urinary calcium excretion, serum 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, blood ionized calcium, the clearance of calcitonin from plasma, and its rate of inactivation in vitro by the kidney and liver. In contrast, food restriction modulated an increase with age in calcitonin secreting C-cells, thyroidal calcitonin and thyroidal calcitonin mRNA pools. We conclude that the lowering of age-related increase in serum calcitonin levels by food restriction is likely because of lowered thyroid calcitonin pools rather than changes in the metabolism of calcium, which is the primary stimulus for calcitonin secretion. Our findings also suggest that food restriction decreases age-related increase in calcitonin levels, at least in part, by modulating the expression of the calcitonin gene.\r"

The ages of the animals studied ranged from 6 wk to 9 yr. After the DNA had been extracted from the liver cell nuclei and hydrolyzed with acid, the bases were analyzed by column chromatography with Cellulofine gels (GC-15-m). Two peaks in the chromatogram, which eluted before the four DNA bases, contained modified bases. Those materials, which were obtained in relatively large amounts from old animals, were highly fluorescent, and were shown to be crosslinked base products by mass spectrometry. The yield of crosslinked products versus rabbit age (greater than 0.5 yr) can be fitted by an exponential function (correlation coefficient: 0.76 +/- 0.09).\r"

Acute doses of radiation ranged from 1 krad to 300 krads. All stages required doses above 100 krads to reduce mean life span. Dauers and third stage larvae were more sensitive, and 8-day-old adults were the most resistant. Occasional statistically significant but nonrepeatable increases in survival were observed after intermediate levels of irradiation (10-30 krads). Unirradiated rad-4 and rad-7 had life spans similar to wild-type; all others had a significant reduction in survival. The mutants were about as sensitive as wild-type to the effects of ionizing radiation including occasional moderate life span extensions at intermediate doses. We conclude that the moderate life span extensions sometimes observed after irradiation are likely to be mediated by a means other than the induction of DNA repair enzymes.\r"

To test understanding of patients' preferences by potential surrogate decisionmakers, we studied primary care physicians' (n = 105) and spouses' (n = 90) predictions of elderly outpatients' (n = 258) preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and CPR plus ventilator (CPR + V), assuming three baseline health states: current health, stroke, and chronic lung disease. Although more than three-quarters of physicians and spouses surveyed believed their predictions of patients' preferences were accurate, the accuracy of physicians' and spouses' predictions did not exceed that expected due to chance alone in 5 of 6, and 3 of 6 decisions, respectively. Physicians significantly underestimated patients' preferences for resuscitation in the stroke and chronic lung disease scenarios (p less than .01), and significantly overestimated them in the current health/CPR decision (p less than .05). Spouses overestimated patients' preferences for resuscitation in all decisions, significantly so in the three CPR + V decisions (p less than .05). These results suggest physicians and spouses often do not understand elderly outpatients' resuscitation preferences. Under these circumstances they are unlikely to provide accurate substituted judgments.\r"

Direct effects were estimated for mental status (-.35), mental status change (.51), binocular visual disability (-.39), binocular visual disability change over one year (.51), and baseline ADL (.36), with 45% of variance explained. Age and baseline mental status had important indirect effects through mental status change, and presurgical visual disability had important indirect effects through both visual disability change and mental status change. In summary, change in level of function one year after cataract surgery was not explained solely by change in vision, but was conditional on baseline function and baseline mental status and mediated in part by change in mental status.\r"

Multivariate analyses demonstrate no particular disadvantage associated with living alone for this group of elderly women. After controlling for age and socioeconomic status, analyses indicate that it is those living with persons other than their husbands who are most impaired. In addition, poor health does not appear to result from living arrangement; rather, those who are sickest choose to live with others because of health problems.\r"

Sixty-three percent of the cohort was female, all were white, and the average age was 73.0 years +/- 5.3 (SD). Participants in regular physical activity at baseline had a reduced risk of fracture; the risk ratio (RR) of fracture for men and women, respectively, was RR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.17 to 1.01 and RR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.50 to 1.15. Walking at least one mile 3 times/week appeared to offer a protective effect for both sexes. After controlling for potentially confounding variables including body mass and selected health conditions, the RR for regular physical activity on fracture incidence in men and women remained essentially unchanged. We conclude that regular physical activity such as walking may protect against fracture in older persons.\r"

Total sleep time and the ratio of total sleep time to time in bed (sleep efficiency) decreased significantly with age. Duration of REM sleep after adjustment for differences in sleep time did not vary significantly after age 30. Frequency and duration of NPT, but not degree of circumferential increases during tumescent episodes, decreased progressively with age independent of variations in sleep. In contrast to men in the younger age groups, the majority of men above age 60 did not have full sleep erections even though they and their partners reported regular intercourse.

Although many researchers have noted that the absolute levels of peak performance among superathletes have improved dramatically in the last 100 years, to date no one has answered the question of stability of peak performance age over this time period. Analyses of Olympic track and field and swimming data show that the age at which peak performance is achieved has remained remarkably consistent. For both men and women, the age of peak performance increases with the length of the foot race, and women generally achieve peak performance at younger ages. The pattern of increased age with increasing distance is reversed for female swimmers, where younger ages are associated with increasing distance. For most categories of performance in baseball, the peak age of performance is equivalent to that of a long distance runner, about 28 years of age, while top tennis players reach their highest levels of performance at age 24. Golfers, in comparison, peak at about 31 years of age, although recent data suggest movement toward younger ages. A task analysis of each event is carried out, and the relative roles of biology and learning are discussed as determinants of peak performance.\r"

Experiment 1 compared recall accuracy for preselected (subject-defined) and constrained (experimenter-defined) movements under three different retention conditions. Not surprisingly, the DAT patients showed significantly larger reproduction errors than did the controls. In all three groups, however, preselected movements were recalled more accurately than constrained movements. This preselection advantage was replicated in Experiment 2 using a new group of DAT patients with recall being performed under both same- and switch-limb conditions. While the results suggested that DAT patients suffer from both an encoding deficiency and a rapid loss of information from short-term memory, they also indicate that patients are capable of coding meaningful aspects of motor movements. Most importantly, the results suggest that in the motor domain, efforts to enhance encoding can facilitate the recall of DAT patients.\r"

However, because of the spatial restructuring of both elderly and nonelderly migration, the contribution of elderly migration relative to nonelderly migration increased from 1960 to 1980. Recognizable regional variations were apparent. Elderly migration not only remained significant in explaining changes in elderly population concentrations in \"traditional\" Sunbelt retirement states but also showed increased importance in newly emergent southern retirement states and in several northern states, including a group in New England.\r"

It is argued that an analysis of the effects of sex roles on medical care must look at the entire process and not just focus on the outcome variables of physician visits and hospitalization. Gender interactions are emphasized, but race interactions also are examined. Findings show that men and women differ in the number of illnesses they report, the likelihood of having a life-threatening illness, the degree of disability, and their perception of their health. Indicators of medical need were found to be the strongest measures in predicting the recency of seeing a physician; however, the physician visit had the strongest effect in determining hospitalization. No direct effects of gender or race on physician visits were found, and only one interaction was significant; however, the results were very different when the measure of medical care use was hospitalization. Both additive and interactive effects by gender and race were found when predicting hospitalization.\r"

The highest response was from subjects using their own initiative to participate in the program (62%), followed by members of 23 communal farms, where 59% of subjects submitted specimens. The lowest response came from a low-middle class urban neighborhood (10%), and an intermediate response from an upper middle-class neighborhood (17%). Subsequent to the mail campaigns, a series of local newspaper articles yielded 6,519 specimens. Over all, 59% of subjects requesting kits returned specimens. Among the 7,096 specimens submitted, 145 (2%) were positive for occult blood. One hundred and twelve subjects were evaluated colonoscopically. Sixteen malignancies (14%) and 34 benign growths (30%) were found and resected. The prevalence of benign and malignant large bowel lesions was 7.0 and 7.2 per 1000 specimens in the screened urban and farm communities, respectively. In communities with limited resources for early cancer detection programs, efforts should be directed toward subgroups at risk who are most likely to respond.\r"

These patients were classified into 3 groups: band, diet, and levator strainodynia. The first, band strainodynia, more common in men, presented with a normal stool character. However, the rectal neck pressure was elevated, and a fibrous band could be demonstrated by a rectal neck biopsy. Bandotomy relieved the strainodynia. Diet strainodynia, more common in women, presented with stool frequency and weight less than normal. Rectal neck pressure was normal or elevated, and the rectosphincteric reflex was diminished. There was internal sphincter fibrosis. Improvement occurred after dietary management or internal sphincterotomy. Levator strainodynia was due to levator dysfunction syndrome. Stools were repeatedly obstructed at defecation despite normal stool character. Rectal neck pressure was elevated only on straining. There was reduced levator myoelectric activity. Levatorplasty cured the condition.\r"

The incidence of endotoxemia, gram-negative bacteremia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hepatic failure were significantly higher in the severe cases than in the mild ones. In the severe cases, the incidence of neutrophile infiltration into the sinusoids (12 of 16) and microabscesses in the lobules (11 of 16) was also significantly higher than in the mild cases. Finally, the incidence of portal thrombosis (10 of 16) and massive necrosis of the hepatic cells (5 of 16) was significantly higher in the severe than in the mild cases, especially in the patients who later died. The results suggest that neutrophilic infiltration into the sinusoid and microabscesses in the lobules is a characteristic finding in severe cholangitis.\r"

A detailed examination of the educational program in gastroenterology at the Kitasato University Hospital, one of the newer private teaching hospitals in Japan, reflects the cultural and environmental differences from an American experience. A residency system on the American model has been developed at this hospital. The extensive training in gastroenterological diagnostic techniques, including contrast radiography and endoscopy, is most striking. The ability to describe pathological abnormalities with precision is given great emphasis. Subspecialty training in medical or surgical gastroenterology is not standardized and is oriented primarily toward research and the development of expertise in a limited academic area.\r"

This reflects both the advanced age of the patients and the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis. Currently, extensive multimodality, periodic evaluation of patients is advocated following potentially curative resections in the hope that colorectal cancer recurrence will be identified when metastases are isolated and curable. Such efforts, however, have failed to make any substantial impact on survival. At this time, the identification of colorectal cancer at an earlier than usual stage appears to be the only means by which survival can be improved. Despite this, substantially more effort and resources are devoted to the postoperative follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer than to the identification of early curable colorectal cancer. In the current economic climate and with limited medical resources, it may be more appropriate to aim primarily at identifying early curable lesions by more routine colonscopy.\r"

Reflux events were analyzed in the two separate postprandial periods, their sum (double postprandial pHmetry), and a standard 24-h period. Data from all pH-recording periods were compared and correlation coefficients were obtained between postprandial and 24-h reflux events. While pH recordings from the two separate postprandial periods provided good separation between patients and controls, double postprandial pHmetry was most accurate in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. In the latter procedure, mean percent reflux time was 2.5 +/- 1.8% in controls and 19.4% +/- 10.3% in patients (p less than 0.001), with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 97%. A high degree of correlation existed for all reflux events between postprandial and 24-h pHmetries. We believe that double postprandial intraesophageal pH monitoring accurately distinguishes between normal persons and patients with pathological reflux. The technique considerably shortens the examination time in relation to 24-h pH monitoring and may prove the esophageal test of choice for objective evidence of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Apart from two patients with dermatitis herpetiformis, nonclassical clinical presentations were observed in 16 of 50 (32%) patients overall and in 13 of 28 (46%) patients diagnosed since 1981. Diarrhea was the most common complaint leading to the diagnosis; since 1981, hematologic abnormalities warranted investigation in 38% of the patients. Decreased iron stores (88%), decreased red cell folate (82%), or both (74%), and abnormal radiographic studies of the small bowel (83%) were the most sensitive tests in the diagnostic investigation.

However, one-third of the patients with clinically active disease had normal CRP while one-third of the patients in clinical remission had a raised CRP. The longitudinal study showed that (a) in patients with active disease, CRP levels tended to decrease as the disease went into remission; (b) in patients who achieved remission, the likelihood of clinical relapse after 2 years of entry was higher in those with persistently raised CRP than in those with persistently normal CRP; and (c) in patients with quiescent disease at entry who remained in remission throughout the first year of the study, the likelihood of clinical relapse during the second year of the study was higher for those with persistently raised CRP than for the others. This study confirms that serum CRP is a useful laboratory index for supplementing clinical scores in patients with Crohn's disease, in monitoring the response to treatment, in helping to predict the course of the disease, and in contributing to defining subgroups of patients.\r"

I compared the characteristics of 20 ascitic fluid samples from these patients with heart failure to those of 20 patients with cirrhotic ascites. The serum-ascites albumin concentration gradient was greater than or equal to 1.1 g/dl in all patients in both groups. The ascitic fluid total protein concentration was greater than or equal to 2.5 g/dl in all patients with cardiac ascites whereas only 10% of patients with cirrhotic ascites had such high values. The ascitic fluid lactate dehydrogenase and red cell counts were significantly higher in cardiac ascites than in cirrhotic ascites--although cardiac ascites was not visibly bloody. The peripheral hematocrit of patients with cardiac ascites was also significantly higher than that of patients with cirrhotic ascites. The ascitic fluid analysis in patients with cardiac ascites is characteristic and may assist in the differential diagnosis of ascites.\r"

Barium follow-up examinations of 21 patients with Crohn's disease who had serum albumin concentrations of 2.1-4.4 g/dl were reviewed. Fourteen of these patients (67%) had increased mean jejunal width. All patients with direct radiologic evidence of a stricture (six patients) had increased jejunal caliber, but this only accounted for 43% of patients with this abnormality. Of the remaining eight patients, six had hypoalbuminemia, three of whom had serum albumin concentrations less than or around 2.7 g/dl, the previously determined \"albumin threshold\" for jejunal dilatation. We conclude that increased jejunal caliber in Crohn's disease not only occurs in association with distal intestinal stenosis but also with severe hypoalbuminemia in the absence of obstruction. We were unable to define a cause of jejunal dilatation in 36% of these patients, but propose that functional obstruction due to distal nonstenosing inflammatory disease may be a factor.\r"

Twenty-three peptic ulcers were found by both; in addition, each diagnosed another ulcer. Fourteen ulcer scars were diagnosed by both; endoscopy demonstrated 10 additional scars and radiology 1.

T tubes remain in-situ for longer than grommets, and they are frequently used in cases where multiple grommet insertions have failed to provide adequate middle ear ventilation. They have also been used when prolonged Eustachian-tubal insufficiency is anticipated, for instance in children with cleft palate. Shepard grommets continue to be the most commonly used type of ventilating tube for short-term use and a significant proportion of children with glue ear require repeated insertions. In an attempt to reduce the need for repeated myringotomy, and also to reduce the need for adenoidectomy in children with glue ear, it has been the recent practice of one Consultant (K.S.M.) to use T tubes routinely in all cases of glue ear. This study analyses the audiometric performance and complications of 32 children (60 ears) who underwent myringotomy and insertion of T tubes for glue ear. In all cases no previous treatment for glue ear had been undertaken. The results are compared with those of a control group who underwent myringotomy with insertion of Shepard grommets and adenoidectomy as a first-line treatment.\r"

Approximately 10 mm. of the cochlear turns are accessible, being less than a third of their length. The middle cranial fossa, the facial nerve, the internal carotid artery and the temporomandibular joint restrict the access. A further restriction is caused by the position of the cochlea and the direction of its axis. The anterior part of the cochlea lies anterior to the tympanic membrane and medial to the temporomandibular joint, thus limiting an endaural approach to a postero-lateral direction. Despite this limitation small sections of the basal, middle and apical turns of the cochlea can be reached.\r"

A submaximal bench step test is used for the estimation of aerobic fitness. A BASIC program operating on a Macintosh provides calculations of fitness levels and produces an individualized exercise prescription. While obviously not suitable for every patient, this approach is practical for young to middle-aged low-risk individuals interested in beginning regular training programs.\r"

  ".W": "With estimates as high as 1.8 million individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States, the majority asymptomatic, it is crucial that all physicians routinely use adequate disinfection procedures for medical instruments. The protosigmoidoscopic disinfection procedures used by US family physicians were evaluated for adequacy in inactivating HIV. Sixty-seven percent of 1,585 randomly selected American Academy of Family Physicians members completed a mail survey regarding these procedures. Comparing procedures used with those recommended by the Centers for Disease Control or documented to inactivate HIV, 32.4 percent were judged to be appropriate procedures; 54.4 percent of the procedures were not tested or recommended; and 13.2 percent used appropriate solutions but at inadequate concentrations or exposure times. Therefore, a substantial proportion of US family physicians performing endoscopic procedures use disinfection procedures that may not inactivate HIV. The ever-increasing prevalence of HIV demands that standardized adequate disinfection procedures be implemented by all physicians to prevent the potential nosocomial spread of HIV.\r"

As more knowledge is accumulated about health problems at high altitudes, exercise has been implicated as a factor contributing to acute mountain sickness in susceptible individuals. Thus, exercise conditioning programs occurring at high altitudes have come under scrutiny. Twenty-eight young men and women were enrolled in an Outward Bound course at an altitude over 3000 m for a 21-day period. Twelve of the 28 individuals developed shortness of breath, cough, or both by the third day of the course. Of these 12, seven had pulmonary function abnormalities: three having evidence of large airway involvement and four having findings of small airway involvement. The symptoms were not significant enough to interfere with acclimatization and the muscular conditioning aspects of the program. Although at altitudes between 3000 m and 4300 m, pulmonary function abnormalities of acute mountain sickness develop in a significant number of participants, the abnormalities were not significant enough to prevent persons from completing the course or achieving marked improvements in fitness measurements.\r"

Fifty-six obese adults who had been patients in a university family practice setting for at least five years between 1980 and 1986 were surveyed by telephone. Questions were designed to determine factors considered important to obese individuals in their weight-loss efforts and to determine factors related to weight loss among obese individuals. Nearly all of the survey participants felt that they had a good knowledge of nutrition and that they applied their knowledge of nutrition to their daily eating. They did not feel that additional knowledge of nutrition would help them control their obesity. Participants reporting physician attention to their obesity and recent weight-loss program experience were more likely to be categorized as weight losers over the five-year interval. Factors felt to be important in their weight loss by most patients who lost weight at some time were exercise and self-motivation.\r"

The baseline population consisted of all patients between the ages of 20 and 65 years who were active in the practices in 1978. During the five years of the study, a medical assistant in each practice recorded data on morbidity, mortality, and patients leaving the practice. The follow-up of nonresponders to a demographic questionnaire provided additional data on patient moves. The overall five-year move rate was 13.2 percent for men and 16.6 percent for women. Those in the 20- to 29-year age group had the highest rates, and those in the 30- to 39-year age group had the next highest. The rates for men stabilized after the age of 40 years to between 8 and 10 percent, and for women after 40 years to between 11 and 13 percent. The move rates were higher in urban than in rural practices. Ninety percent of hypertensive patients received continuous care over the five-year period. In southwestern Ontario, population mobility does not appear to be a major barrier to continuing care.\r"

Privileges in medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics, and coronary care/intensive care units (CCU/ICU) were examined. Questionnaires were mailed to a random sample of 308 residency graduates aged 30 to 35 years, all 383 family practice residency directors, and a random sample of 319 third-year residents. Two mailings produced an 82 percent response rate. Most recent graduates had privileges in medicine (97 percent), pediatrics (95 percent), and CCU/ICU (87 percent). A majority (64 percent) had obstetric privileges, and a minority (36 percent) had surgical privileges. Directors were accurate in their perceptions of privileges attained by graduates in medicine, pediatrics, and CCU/ICU, but underestimated the percentage who had privileges in surgery and overestimated the percentage who had privileges in obstetrics. Residents planned on seeking privileges in medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics at a rate similar to recent graduates, with lower percentages planning on seeking them in surgery and CCU/ICU. Privileges in surgery and obstetrics were more prevalent in the Midwest and West.\r"

Results revealed that patients with multiple personality are usually women who present with depression, suicide attempts, repeated amnesic episodes, and a history of childhood trauma, particularly sexual abuse. Also common were headaches, hysterical conversion, and sexual dysfunction. Intellectual level varied from borderline to superior. The MMPI reflected underlying character pathology in addition to depression and dissociation. Significant neurological or electroencephalographical abnormalities were infrequent. These data suggest that the etiology of multiple personality is strongly related to childhood trauma rather than to an underlying electrophysiological dysfunction.\r"

These factors, however, could not explain the behavior of those skeptics who deliberately interfered with the clinical care of patients and who engaged in repeated acts of harassment against the patient and/or therapist. Half of the survey respondents reported that they had encountered these latter forms of extreme skepticism.\r"

The present report describes the standardization of this scale and the pattern of findings on two cohorts of 114 and 150 inpatients. The results support the discriminative validity of the MOAS and its internal, interrater, and retest reliabilities. Within 1 week some form of aggression was noted in about one fourth of the patient samples, with verbal aggression the most prevalent and autoaggression the least. Chronic patients showed the lowest incidence of physical assault and general aggression, whereas gender differences and daily variations were not significant. Greater stability of aggression was demonstrated for patient groups and for forms of aggression with higher base rates and for the short term (within 1 week) rather than the long course (3 months). The high prevalence of aggression and the consistency of profiles across patient samples suggested that sensitive, multivariable scaling can improve the accuracy of measurement and the depiction of the construct.\r"

Its reliability, discriminative validity, and predictive validity were supported in its application to a total of 208 inpatients. Aggressive patients were more often found to be men, to be diagnosed with organic mental syndrome or substance abuse disorder, and to be notable in history of aggression. They tended to be angry and excitable but not more floridly ill than control subjects. The contemporaneous covariates of aggression, however, were not the same as the predictors, as determined by 3-month prospective follow-up. Twelve significant predictors were identified, and multiple regression analysis revealed different sets of measures that explain 45.0% to 52.5% of the variance for verbal, physical, and total aggression. The most reliable predictors were younger age, shorter length of illness, hostility, depression, anger, and difficulty in delaying gratification. We concluded that prediction is augmented by the combination of clinical and nonclinical predictors, and we discussed likely sources of disparity in previous research.\r"

Few have come to appreciate that, realistically, there are no options as to directionality in the usual sense of \"following forward\" vs \"investigating backward\", or in the related sense of \"inferential reasoning\" being \"from cause to effect\" vs \"from effect to cause\". Related to this, few appreciate that the perceived duality of options constituted by \"sampling by exposure\" and \"sampling by outcome\" is, similarly, but an illusion. Old illusions like these confound the discernment of even those who, today, strive to deconfound the fundamentals of epidemiologic study design.\r"

Multivariate analyses examined the amount of residual disability attributable to stroke among 2540 community-dwelling survivors, 27 years after their initial examination, after controlling for age, cardiovascular risk factors, other cardiovascular diseases, and eight general health conditions related to physical disability. Among men living in the community, a history of stroke explained 12% of the variance in physical disability. Suffering a stroke, however, was not as strongly related to physical disability among women living in the community, accounting for only 3% of the variance. Results suggest that although older men and women die from the same major causes, they may not be disabled by the same conditions.\r"

Pearson's correlation coefficients were 0.65 for weight, 0.61 for height, 0.32 for systolic BP and 0.29 for diastolic BP over an 8-year period. Children maintaining their percentile rank for weight or BMI showed higher correlations than those increasing or decreasing their percentile rank. Girls' menarcheal status did not have a significant effect on the level of BP at 14 years of age. The prevalence of significant and severe BP as defined by the NHLBI Task Force was 1% at 6 years and 0.4% at 14 years. The predictive value of the BP at 6 years for 14 years of age was low even for those with hypertension levels: for SBP 16-33% and for DBP 0-37%. Based on the present study and others, large scale screening of BP is not recommended, rather community based programs aimed at modifying health behaviour in order to prevent development of cardiovascular risk factors and associated morbidity and mortality should be introduced.\r"

Body weight and height, blood pressure, resting pulse rate, education, birth order and a health score were recorded. The average Body Mass Index was 20.8 kg/m2. About 5% of the men were very lean (BMI less than 18) and only about 2% had grade I obesity (BMI greater than 25). During 32 years of follow-up 3642 men died. By means of a logistic regression analysis the impact of Body Mass Index (BMI) at the age of 18 on longevity was investigated. Healthy, well-educated men with a BMI of 19 had a higher rate of survival during the entire follow-up period. A negative effect of a high BMI (greater than 25) was only demonstrable after 20 years of follow-up. Men with a BMI under 18 had an increased mortality risk, which was mainly caused by an impaired health status. The results of this study support the hypothesis that moderately obese young men have an increased mortality risk.\r"

One hundred and seven women who were controls in case-control studies of breast disease were re-interviewed approximately one year after initial interview. Both interviews addressed the same time period, namely that which preceded the first interview. For most of the quantitative variables studied, at least 70% of individuals provided two estimates (original and repeat) which were within one unit of each other. Also, comparison of the categorization of individuals on repeated measurements of qualitative variables (reports of events, operations and habits) revealed that most individuals were categorized consistently. This strong agreement between the original and repeat estimates was also reflected in the relatively high values of the summary measures of agreement (the intraclass correlation coefficient for quantitative variables and the Kappa statistic for qualitative variables) for most of the variables studied. The results of the present study on repeatability complement the results of previous research into the criterion validity of questionnaire-derived information and, taken together, suggest that information of relatively high quality may be obtained from such sources.\r"

Eligible patients required: a 4- to 8-hour treatment plan, including chemotherapy and other long-term intravenous (i.v.) treatment; a stable cardiovascular status; mental competence; no skilled overnight nursing; and a helper to assist with home care. Patients were ineligible if standard outpatient treatment was possible. No statistically significant (p less than 0.05) differences were found between the Adult Day Hospital (ADH) and Inpatient care in medical or psychosocial outcomes over the 60-day study period. The major difference was in medical costs--approximately one-third lower for ADH patients (p less than 0.001) than for the Inpatient group. The study demonstrates that day hospital care of medical oncology patients is clinically equivalent to Inpatient care, causes no negative psychosocial effects, and costs less than Inpatient care. Findings support the trend toward dehospitalization of medical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The relationships between the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), mean annual per capita alcohol consumption and primary liver cancer (PLC) death rates were explored in 30 countries. HBsAg prevalence was associated, significantly, with the logarithm of the primary liver cancer death rate (simple correlation coefficient = 0.44, p less than 0.05). This significant association increased following adjustment for a country's mean annual per capita alcohol consumption (partial correlation coefficient = 0.53, p less than 0.01). A logarithmic linear relationship was also found between per capita alcohol consumption and the primary liver cancer death rate after adjustment for the country's prevalence of HBsAg (partial correlation coefficient = 0.38, p less than 0.05). Results from both correlation and regression analyses showed that prevalence of HBsAg was more significantly associated with PLC death rates than was alcohol consumption. However, these two variables were independently related to the PLC death rate in a stepwise multiple regression model. We could not demonstrate an interaction between the two variables. These findings are consistent with the prevailing view that chronic hepatitis B infection is the major factor in the most common form of primary liver cell cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, they support the notion that alcohol consumption contributes significantly and independently, although probably to a lesser extent than hepatitis B, to deaths from that disease.\r"

Residual cancer less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter was confirmed at operation in all patients before irradiation consisting of 2,550 to 3,000 rad to the whole abdomen with partial liver/kidney shielding and boosting of the dose to the diaphragmatic/paraaortic nodal regions and pelvis to approximately 4,000 and 5,000 rad, respectively. Twelve patients (23%) did not complete therapy as a result of hematologic intolerance. Actuarial overall and disease-free survival at 3 years are 35% and 30%, respectively, with follow-up for disease-free patients ranging from 30 to 79 months (median, 43 months). Twenty-seven of 36 relapses (75%) occurred within the irradiated abdomen alone. At 3 years, 70% of patients with well- or moderately-differentiated tumors were disease-free v 10% of those with poorly differentiated tumors (P less than .001). Among prognostic factors evaluated, including grade, initial residual disease before chemotherapy, residual disease at time of irradiation, age, chemotherapy response v progression, and completion of irradiation, only grade and initial residual disease before chemotherapy were statistically significant in multivariate analysis (both P less than .01). Patients with the combination of high-grade tumor, initial residual disease greater than 2 cm before chemotherapy, and macroscopic disease after \"second-look\" laparotomy do not benefit from irradiation. Eleven patients (21%) developed an apparent treatment-related bowel obstruction after completion of irradiation. Selected subsets of patients do well; however, the role of irradiation in this setting can be confirmed only with randomized clinical study.\r"

Long-term follow-up of high-risk patients treated in a previously reported randomized control trial of intravesical plus percutaneous BCG shows that progression occurred in 41/43 (95%) of control and 23/43 (53%) of BCG-treated patients. Muscle invasive and/or metastatic disease occurred with equal frequency in the two groups, but was significantly delayed by BCG treatment (P = .012). Cystectomies were required in 18/43 (42%) control and 11/43 (26%) BCG-treated patients. Median time to cystectomy was 8 months for control v 24 months for BCG-treated patients. Based on initial treatment, survival was improved by BCG therapy (P = .032) (median follow-up 6 years). These results suggest that in high-risk patients intravesical BCG can delay disease progression, prolong the period of bladder preservation, and increase overall survival.\r"

  ".W": "A study of 60 patients with clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumor (NSGCT) was conducted to identify prognostic factors that may predict the likelihood of metastasis. Clinical features and histopathologic features of the primary testicular tumor were examined and analyzed for correlations with the presence of retroperitoneal nodal metastasis documented by surgery (N+) and with development of relapse (R+). Pathologic tumor stage greater than or equal to 2, with tumor extension into the tunica albuginea, rete testis, epididymis, or spermatic cord, was correlated with an increased rate of N+ compared with pathologic tumor stage I (P = .001). Vascular invasion was correlated with a higher rate of N+ (P = .05) and had a similar association with R+ (P = .08). Tumors containing less than 50% teratoma were found to have a higher rate of N+ than tumors with greater than or equal to 50% teratoma (P = .02). Based on the identified prognostic factors, a model for predicting the probability of retroperitoneal nodal metastasis in clinical stage I patients is proposed. The risk factors for nodal metastasis are: pathologic tumor stage greater than or equal to 2, vascular invasion, and less than 50% teratoma. Patients with none of the risk factors are considered at low risk and may be offered orchiectomy alone with surveillance for initial treatment. Patients with all three risk factors are at high risk and should be treated with a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) or possibly chemotherapy. Patients with one or two risk factors are at intermediate risk; it is recommended that they undergo RPLND. This risk model facilitates a rational approach to the management of clinical stage I NSGCT.\r"

General anesthesia is now the most common anesthetic technique used, but of 337 carotid endarterectomies performed by the author's service from 1981 through 1985, 305 (91%) were conducted with regional anesthesia. This paper presents the morbidity and mortality rates for those patients. There were two perioperative transient ischemic attacks (0.66%), two perioperative strokes (0.66%), and two perioperative deaths (0.66%). No patient in the series suffered a myocardial infarction within 30 days after endarterectomy. This series demonstrates that carotid endarterectomy can be performed with good results using regional anesthesia, which facilitates intraoperative cerebral function monitoring. Regional anesthesia is associated with a very low incidence of postoperative hypertension and perioperative myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events. In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage.\r"

  ".W": "The authors describe three cases of clinical cerebral ischemia associated with angiographic evidence of cerebral arterial luminal narrowing presenting 7, 14, and 52 weeks after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and aneurysm clipping. Delayed vasospasm, in its usual time setting 1 or 2 weeks after hemorrhage, did not occur symptomatically in these patients. No evidence for aneurysm clip migration or rebleed was present. All patients responded favorably to volume expansion and elevation of blood pressure. This unusual occurrence of a very delayed vasospasm may further the understanding of the vasospastic process. The symptomatic onset of arterial luminal narrowing months after SAH may suggest that a proliferative vasculopathy more accurately explains the observed vessel narrowing, rather than conventional active constriction of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Patients surviving 10 years after the operation were identified, and their original surgical specimens were reexamined. Six (0.5%) of 1147 patients were shown to have survived for between 12 and 28 years after surgery for supratentorial astrocytomas grade III and IV. All six patients are in good condition, without signs of tumor recurrence. The only obvious common denominator for the survivors is their youth at operation. Three patients were 7 to 11 years old at surgery, and none was older than 38 years. It is concluded that a cure may be possible in exceptional patients with the \"incurable\" astrocytoma grade III and IV.\r"

The lesions were frontal in 18 patients, temporal or temporoparietal in 17, and parieto-occipital in 10. No patient with a frontal or parieto-occipital hematoma had clinical signs of transtentorial herniation at admission or subsequently, whereas seven (41%) of those with temporal or temporoparietal lesions had signs of herniation (p less than 0.05); three of these seven patients had an abnormal mental status, ipsilateral anisocoria, and lateralizing motor findings at admission, and four developed these signs within 12 hours after admission, necessitating urgent surgical intervention. The mean volume of the lesions estimated from the CT scans was similar in the three groups (frontal 47 +/- 28 cc; parieto-occipital 53 +/- 26 cc; temporal/temporoparietal 41 +/- 21 cc). None of the six patients with temporal or temporoparietal hematomas smaller than 30 cc had signs of tentorial herniation, compared with seven (64%) of 11 patients with larger hematomas (p less than 0.05); in six of these seven cases, the hematoma was caused by head injury. Patients with a temporal or temporoparietal hematoma had a worse outcome than those in the other two groups, and no patient with signs of tentorial herniation had a good outcome. Patients with temporal or temporoparietal hematomas appear to be at greater risk of brain-stem compression, especially if the lesion is larger than 30 cc and caused by head injury, than are those with hematomas in other sites. In such cases, prompt surgical intervention should be considered.\r"

Progressive visual loss, the most frequent initial complaint (94.7%), occurred over a mean of 24 1/2 months, was most often unilateral (18 patients) or bilateral but asymmetrical (14 patients), and was severe (20/200 vision or worse) in 23 patients; 24 patients had visual field abnormalities. Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance studies clearly delineated the lesions but did not appear to permit earlier diagnosis. Eleven patients had tumors limited to the tuberculum sellae; the tumor extended from the tuberculum sellae onto the planum sphenoidale in nine patients, into one optic canal in eight, onto the diaphragma sellae in seven, and onto the medial sphenoid wing in three. Patients with tumors affecting the optic canal had severe unilateral visual loss more often than those with tumors at other sites. Tumors limited to the tuberculum sellae were most often completely resected; postoperative recovery of vision was also most frequent in patients with tumors at this site. Tumors involving the diaphragma sellae or the medial sphenoid wing were least often completely removed and most likely to be associated with postoperative visual deterioration. Overall, 42% of patients had improved vision postoperatively, 30% remained unchanged, and 28% were worse. After a mean follow-up period of 38 months, 24 patients are doing well, four have significant visual disability, and three are blind or doing poorly. Two patients died of causes unrelated to their tumor. Three patients have had tumor recurrence.\r"

The exposure reaches just to the hairpin bend of the carotid siphon, but the bend is not seen. The curve in the carotid artery which is observed after anterior clinoid removal is distal to the hairpin turn and corresponds to a bend seen on the anteroposterior projection of the angiogram. Temporary occlusion of the carotid artery proximal to a paraclinoid aneurysm is possible after clinoid removal. Complications of the removal include trauma to the third nerve and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective study of 514 consecutive patients whose intracranial pressure (ICP) was monitored after elective supratentorial or infratentorial surgery is reported. Of the 412 patients operated on in the supratentorial region, 76 (18.4%) had a postoperative sustained ICP elevation exceeding 20 torr. Abnormally high ICP occurred after 13 (12.7%) of the 102 infratentorial operations. Risk factors for postoperative ICP elevation were: resection of glioblastoma in 27.2% of cases, repeat surgery in 42.9% of cases, and protracted surgery (greater than 6 hours) in 41.7% of cases. Of the 89 patients with elevated ICP, 47 (52.8%) had an associated clinical deterioration. In 19 of these, the rise in ICP occurred before this deterioration was noticed, leading as a rule to quick diagnostic and management response. In eight patients clinical deterioration was noticed before the rise in ICP, and in 20 it happened simultaneously. The higher the level of ICP elevation, the greater were the chances of associated deterioration. The most common findings on computerized tomography scanning in 35 of 89 patients with elevated ICP were brain edema (19 cases) and bleeding in the tumor bed (15 cases). Mannitol, thiopental, additional hyperventilation, and reintubation (in patients who were previously extubated) were used to reduce ICP, in addition to surgical decompression whenever indicated. Thirteen patients with raised ICP and clinical deterioration underwent reoperation. The postoperative infection rate was 1.2% (six cases). In only one patient could infection be attributed to ICP monitoring. It was concluded that ICP monitoring is advantageous in the immediate postoperative management after elective intracranial surgery and is almost risk-free. It should therefore be used liberally, especially when risk factors for ICP elevation can be identified prior to the end of surgery.\r"

Parietal cephaloceles were found in 15 infants (10 boys and five girls), and accounted for 37.5% of all cephaloceles. They consisted of four encephaloceles, six meningoceles, and five atretic cephaloceles. The clinical and morphological characteristics of parietal cephaloceles were investigated and compared with those arising at other locations. Parietal cephaloceles carried a much less favorable prognosis than those in the occipital region, regardless of the type of cephalocele; they were associated with cerebral malformations more frequently and were more severe than occipital cephaloceles. Grave congenital anomalies were found in 87% of patients with parietal cephalocele, and only two patients (neither of whom had any other malformation) attained normal development. Brain malformations were closely related to the site from which the cephalocele issued, and dorsal cyst malformation was found in eight patients with parietal cephalocele. Two types of atretic cephaloceles were found, each in a different location. The first type was an alopecic lesion occurring in the parietal midline; all five patients with this type had dorsal cyst malformations and none developed normally. The second type was a nodular lesion developing at the occipital midline, not associated with cerebral anomalies; all five patients with this type showed normal development. The pathogenesis of atretic cephaloceles and their associated intracranial malformations are discussed.\r"

However, interpretation of the thermographic image has been troubled by subjectivity. This paper describes a computer-calculated method of collecting data that eliminates subjective biases. Comprehensive normative data are presented on the degree of thermal asymmetry in the human body. The degree of thermal asymmetry between opposite sides of the body (delta T) is very small. For example, the value of delta T for the forehead (mean +/- standard deviation) was 0.18 degree +/- 0.18 degree C, for the leg it was 0.27 degree +/- 0.2 degree C, and for the foot it was 0.38 degree +/- 0.31 degree C. These values were reproducible in both short- and long-term follow-up measurements over a period of 5 years. The delta T's reported here were obtained from 40 matched regions of the body surface of 90 asymptomatic normal individuals. These values can be used as a standard in assessment of sympathetic nerve function, and the degree of asymmetry is a quantifiable indicator of dysfunction.\r"

When asymmetries exceeded 1 standard deviation from the mean temperature of homologous regions measured in 90 normal control subjects, the positive predictive value of thermometry in detecting root impingement was 94.7% and the specificity was 87.5%. These values indicate that calculation of temperature asymmetry is particularly effective in evaluating reported pain in psychosocially affected patient populations in whom the chance of positive myelography or impaired root function is low. In this group of patients, thermometric study provides physicians with important information for proper decision making. The test can be performed to avoid more invasive and probably less revealing diagnostic or exploratory surgical procedures.\r"

These potent inhibitors of lipid peroxidation have been specifically developed for the acute treatment of central nervous system trauma and ischemia. This study evaluated the dose-response characteristics and capability of U-74006F to promote functional recovery in cats subjected to compression trauma of the upper lumbar (L-2) spinal cord. Thirty minutes following injury, randomized and investigator-blinded treatment was initiated with the intravenous administration of either vehicle (citrate-buffered saline) or one of eight doses of U-74006F. Initial doses of U-74006F ranged from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg. Subsequent doses consisted of intravenous bolus injections followed by a continuous 42-hour intravenous infusion. Over the 48-hour treatment period, cats received total U-74006F doses ranging from 0.048 to 160 mg/kg. The animals were evaluated weekly for neurological recovery based upon an 11-point behavioral scale. With the exception of two cats in one group, the animals receiving accumulated doses of U-74006F (ranging from 1.6 to 160.0 mg/kg/48 hrs) exhibited nearly 75% of normal neurological function by 4 weeks after injury. Lower total doses of 0.16 and 0.48 mg/kg/48 hrs were associated with approximately 50% return of normal function, which was not significantly better than the recovery in the vehicle-treated control group. The lowest total dose tested (0.048 mg/kg/48 hrs) gave results indistinguishable from those in vehicle-treated cats, which had recovered only 20% of their preinjury neurological function by 4 weeks. These findings demonstrate that over a 100-fold range of doses, U-74006F has a remarkable capacity to promote functional recovery in spinal cord-injured cats.\r"

  ".W": "Protection of the brain and spinal cord against ischemia is a goal of vast clinical importance. One approach to this objective is to reduce the tissue's functional activity in order to preserve energy for the metabolic processes that are essential to viability. Experiments to explore ways of reducing function-related energy demands were performed on isolated rabbit retina, a well-characterized model of organized adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) tissue. The retina was maintained in a nearly physiological state in a miniature \"heart-lung\" apparatus. Energy metabolism (oxygen consumption and glycolysis) and electrophysiological function (determined by electroretinogram) of the in vitro retina were monitored, and their responses to a series of agents that may reduce energy requirements were determined. Large reversible reductions in O2 consumption, glycolysis, and electrophysiological function were seen in response to mild hypothermia (-3 degrees to -6 degrees C), phenytoin (Dilantin, 100 to 200 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (Librium, 200 microM), lithium (1 to 4 mM), Mg++ (6 to 20 mM), strophanthidin (0.15 to 0.25 microM), CO2 (25% to 30%), 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 500 microM), amiloride (1 mM), and dantrolene (1 mM). One retina was exposed simultaneously to a combination of six of these agents, which reduced its oxidative and glycolytic metabolism to less than 50% of the control level. The retina recovered metabolic and electrophysiological function after a 2 1/2-hour exposure period. Other agents tested (diphenhydramine, midazolam, nifedipine, nimodipine, and quercetin) had effects on energy metabolism and electrophysiological function that were poorly reversible. Surprisingly little effect was seen in response to general anesthetic agents (thiopental and Althesin) and other CNS depressants (chlorpromazine, ethanol, lidocaine, paraldehyde, valproic acid, and baclofen). The presumed mechanisms through which these agents reduce cellular energy requirements, as well as their potential roles in the treatment of CNS ischemia, are discussed.\r"

Using an isometric tension-recording method, the authors then examined the difference in the extent of relaxation between the cerebral and extracerebral arteries. In rabbits, the dose-response curve of the basilar artery for ACh was significantly different (p less than 0.05) from curves of the femoral and common carotid arteries. The IC50 value (the concentration inducing a one-half inhibition of the initial contractile tone) for the basilar artery in ACh-induced relaxation was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than for the common carotid artery, although the mean maximum relaxation of the basilar artery to ACh was not significantly different from that seen in extracerebral arteries. The relaxing effect of ACh in dogs was much less in the middle cerebral and basilar arteries than in the common carotid, vertebral, and femoral arteries. On the other hand, both ATP (in rabbits and dogs) and thrombin (in dogs) induced significantly more (p less than 0.05) relaxation in the cerebral arteries than in the extracerebral arteries. Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by ACh or ATP has been demonstrated in a wide range of arteries from a variety of animals. The present results suggest that ATP has a more important role than ACh in the regulation of the vascular tone of the major cerebral arteries in these two species.\r"

Most of the pituitary tumors and moderately anaplastic astrocytomas had unimodal DNA populations, whereas a higher percentage of other slow-growing tumors, such as meningiomas, ependymomas, and neurilemmomas, had multimodal populations (46.2%, 50.0%, and 60.0%, respectively). A relatively high percentage of the rapidly growing or highly malignant brain tumors, including highly anaplastic astrocytomas, glioblastomas multiforme, metastatic tumors, and medulloblastomas, also had multimodal populations (52.9%, 48.7%, 57.1%, and 66.7%, respectively). In most tumor groups, however, the percentage of tumors with a multimodal DNA population did not correlate with the BUdR labeling index or with the percentage of BUdR-labeled S-phase cells. Thus, modal DNA analysis by flow cytometry may provide information about the degree of heterogeneity and the biological behavior of individual brain tumors, but the results do not necessarily correlate with the rate of tumor growth or the prognosis in individual patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although a number of substances which participate in the physiological control of vascular caliber have been proposed to play a causative role in cerebral vasospasm, none of these has been shown to induce the profound, sustained degree of constriction or the vasculopathy that characterize this disorder. The present study was undertaken to determine whether bilirubin, a hemoglobin breakdown product with detergent-like activity, accrued in incubated blood or in intracranial hematoma and whether topical application of bilirubin altered the caliber or morphology of cerebral arteries. As a model of blood residing in the subarachnoid space, sterile vials of cat blood and of human blood were incubated in vitro at 37 degrees C. The concentration of bilirubin in the supernatant of cat blood increased from a value of 0.27 +/- 0.3 mg% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) on Day 0 to a value of 9.57 +/- 2.4 mg% on Day 10; the respective values for human blood were 0.53 +/- 0.02 mg% and 13.4 +/- 5.4 mg%. Samples of intracranial hematoma that had been surgically removed from three patients between 4 and 11 days after hemorrhage yielded bilirubin levels from 2.1 to 15.2 mg%. Application of a bilirubin suspension of 5, 10, or 20 mg% in buffered Ringer's solution to cat basilar artery in vivo led to progressive and sustained constriction; at 4 hours the mean decrease in the width of the blood column was 34% +/- 2.1%. Ultrastructural analysis of these vessels showed widespread pathological changes similar to those associated with cerebral vasospasm. Application of a 10-mg% bilirubin suspension to the basilar artery of two baboons produced similar alterations. Minimal changes in diameter or morphology were observed in cat arteries bathed in buffer solution alone. These findings in animal models indicate that bilirubin may play a central role in the development of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

At 14 d of age, protein synthesis was measured in duodenum, jejunoileum and ceca after a large dose of L-[4-3H]phenylalanine injected intravenously via a wing vein. The results showed that wet tissue weights for all intestinal sections were significantly greater in CV birds than in GF counterparts with consistently larger differences between the two environments in chicks fed the nonpurified diet than in those fed the purified diet. Protein synthesis in all intestinal sections was significantly enhanced by the presence of gut microflora in terms of both fractional rate (%/d) and absolute rate [mg/(100 g BW.d)]. The effect of diet type on fractional and absolute rates of protein synthesis was most remarkable in ceca where the significant difference between GF and CV states was found only in chicks fed the nonpurified diet but not in those fed the purified diet.\r"

Seven-day food, urine and fecal composites were made and analyzed for their gross energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate content during the fourth and fifth weeks of each dietary consumption period. The metabolizable energy (ME) of these diets was determined (gross energy of the diet - gross energy of urine and feces) and calculated by Atwater's general energy conversion factors (4, 9, 4), by specific energy conversion factors used in a U.S. food table and by formulas derived by various researchers. The coefficients of availability of energy and the energy-containing nutrients, fat, protein and carbohydrate, were lower while subjects were consuming the higher fiber diet. The specific energy conversion factors of the U.S. food table gave better estimates of the true ME of the lower fiber diet than the higher fiber diet, overestimating the ME of these diets by only 6% (diet 1) and 4.6% (diet 2).\r"

Chimpanzees exhibited a response to fiber similar to that of humans. First, increases in the fiber concentration of the diet decreased mean transit time (MTT), hindgut turnover time (T) and the digestibility of fiber. Second, differences in MTT and T between the treatments and animals explained most of the variability in the digestibility of fiber components. Third, consistent with human data, the fiber marker passed more slowly than the liquid marker only when the high fiber diet was consumed. Fourth, individual variability, as in humans, was a significant factor affecting digestion and passage. Fifth, the MTT of chimpanzees was longer than that of humans. This result may be due to the apes' larger hindgut. In comparison with other hominoids, humans have smaller volumes in the gastrointestinal tract and hindgut. The gut proportions of modern humans, in combination with evidence from the fossil record, indicate that during its evolution the human lineage was able to overcome nutritional constraints imposed on body size increases in the great apes. We suggest that this advance was achieved through technological and social innovations that permitted early humans to achieve larger body size without lowering dietary quality.\r"

FD could be produced in 21 d with amino acid diets that promoted maximum growth rate, were completely devoid of folate and contained 1% succinylsulfathiazole. Growth retardation and blood dyscrasia associated with FD could not be demonstrated in rats fed diets containing casein and gelatin as nitrogen sources because the vitamin-free casein contained low but measurable levels of folate. The most effective protocol to produce experimental FD in rats is to feed a folate-free diet that otherwise supports maximum growth in young animals. Additional modifications such as use of methotrexate or amino acid-imbalanced or protein-deficient diets are unnecessary.\r"

Although the fluorescence polarization value of LPM prepared from retinoic acid-fed animals was significantly lower than that of controls (0.201 +/- 0.008 vs. 0.254 +/- 0.005, P less than 0.001), no effect was seen with a vitamin A-deficient diet (0.259 +/- 0.005). No change in the fluorescence polarization was observed in erythrocyte ghost membranes with either vitamin A deficiency or chronic ethanol consumption. The sialic acid concentration of the membranes was significantly higher in LPM and erythrocyte ghosts obtained from vitamin A-deficient animals (37.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 29.6 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg protein for LPM, P less than 0.01, and 77.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 62.0 +/- 1.7 for erythrocyte ghosts, P less than 0.001); the LPM of retinoic acid-treated animals had the lowest values (26.9 +/- 1.6 nmol/mg protein). This sialic acid concentration of LPM was positively correlated with the fluorescence polarization (r = 0.775, P less than 0.001). Chronic ethanol feeding resulted in lower hepatic and LPM vitamin A and greater LPM fluidity with higher cholesterol esters in all diet groups (P less than 0.001). Because increased sialic acid concentration has been incriminated in the pathogenesis of tumor development, it may provide a mechanism whereby lowered hepatic vitamin A promotes carcinogenesis and retinoic acid feeding opposes this process.\r"

  ".W": "The percent absorption of iron from four dietary sources was compared in 2018 human subjects with three indicators of iron status, serum ferritin concentration, percent saturation of plasma transferrin and iron absorption from a reference dose of ferrous sulfate. Higher correlation coefficients (r) were obtained by comparing dietary iron absorption with the reference dose absorption rather than with serum ferritin; for example, r = +0.61 and r = -0.38, respectively, for a meat and vegetable meal. However, in practice serum ferritin is almost as efficient as the reference dose absorption in estimating dietary iron absorption, because the 95% confidence limits calculated from the regression equations were very similar. The values of r calculated for iron absorption versus transferrin saturation were comparable to those obtained with the other indicators only in the range of transferrin saturation values below 25%, whereas in more iron-replete subjects (transferrin saturation greater than 25%), this correlation virtually disappeared. This indicates that, although both serum ferritin and transferrin saturation reflect iron status in iron-depleted subjects, the control of iron absorption in iron-replete subjects is more dependent on iron stores as reflected in the serum ferritin concentration than the percent saturation of transferrin.\r"

In this study three components of K+ influx (Na+-K+ pump = ouabain sensitive, cotransport = bumetanide sensitive and leak = both ouabain and bumetanide insensitive) and Na+ influx were measured with 42K+ and 24Na+ in intact red blood cells of adult male rats. During starvation rats lost an average of 28% of their body weight; pump K+ influx in cells stabilized for 2 h in incubation medium fell from 7.03 +/- 0.74 (SEM) to 4.82 +/- 0.25 mueq/(mL cells.h) with cell [Na+] of 6.4 +/- 0.9 and 4.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/L cells, respectively. Maximized Na+-K+ pump activity in Na+-loaded cells was also lower in cells of starved rats than in those of controls and was inversely correlated with extent of weight loss in the starved rats. Leak K+ influx was reduced from 0.73 +/- 0.08 to 0.47 +/- 0.03. Lower Na+ influx in cells of starved rats was not significant statistically, although alteration in passive Na+ transport was apparent. The results indicate decreases in both active and passive components of ion turnover of erythrocytes of rats during starvation.\r"

Another group of tumor-free mice of similar age fed 15% casein served as a control for the tumor-bearing group fed the 15% casein diet. Moderate restriction of tryptophan in the diet appeared to have no effect on the tumor status of the animal. Tumor burden usually induced malnutrition in the animal. However, tryptophan restriction did not further aggravate this malnutrition. The source of protein, whether casein, amino acid mixture or zein, appeared to make a difference in nutritional status of tumor-bearing animals though not in tumor status. Casein-fed animals generally tended to have higher values for all the nutritional markers studied than did animals fed the amino acid mixture or zein.\r"

Three possible mechanisms have been proposed previously to explain the survival advantage of riboflavin-deficient hosts: a) enhanced fragility of red blood cells (RBC), b) decreased formation of reticulocytes and/or c) decreased concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and ATP. The validity of these proposed mechanisms was tested by investigating whether riboflavin deficiency alters the hemolytic response to three stimuli: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a hypotonic medium or ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP). Reticulocyte counts and concentrations of ATP and GSH were also determined. The percentage of hemolysis induced by H2O2 or FP was significantly less in riboflavin-deficient than in control animals. By contrast, hemolytic response to a hypotonic medium was enhanced during riboflavin deficiency. Despite diminished activity of glutathione reductase and normal glutathione peroxidase activity during riboflavin deficiency, the erythrocyte concentration of GSH was increased over that in control animals. Concentrations of ATP and hemoglobin in erythrocytes as well as the reticulocyte count were unaltered during riboflavin deficiency. Thus, diminished malarial parasitemia in riboflavin-deficient animals occurs despite greater resistance of RBC to either H2O2- or FP-induced hemolysis, and in the presence of a normal reticulocyte count and erythrocytes ATP concentration. Results of this study raise the possibility that Plasmodium parasites have greater requirements for flavin coenzymes, GSH or ATP than those of host erythrocytes, which may explain the apparent protection of the riboflavin-deficient host from malaria.\r"

From methadone decedent analysis: 10,300 abusers in 1986 and the first half of 1987. Speed: 1. From data on gay males: 4,600 regular users in 1987. 2. From CSAS roster: lower limit of 1,214 abusers in fiscal years 1985 through 1987. 3. From capture-recapture method: 5,400 users in fiscal year 1987. IVDUs: 1. From data on Black IVDUs: 19,400 in 1987. 2. From data on Latino IVDUs: 21,100 with lifetime histories in 1987. 3. From CSAS roster: lower limit of 9,350 in fiscal years 1985 through 1987. These estimates can now be assessed, keeping three cautions in mind: (1) different time frames are involved; (2) some estimates are useful only to establish lower or upper bounds; and (3) there is a difference between users (the Coroner reports on decedents who may have used a drug but once) and abusers. The present author's analysis of recent trends in heroin and speed use in San Francisco (Newmeyer 1987) suggests that the number of abusers of each of these drugs was fairly constant between 1985 and 1987. With regard to heroin, the estimate that best meshes with the findings of the present study is that between 10,000 and 12,000 San Franciscans were abusers during 1987. Of these, more than 90 percent used the drug primarily by the IV route.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

SZL-49 produced long lasting inhibition of norepinephrine-induced contractions which was apparent 21 hr after drug washout. The inhibition, which was dose and time dependent, was characterized by progressive shift to the right in the norepinephrine dose-response curve. The ED50 for norepinephrine was shifted from 10(-7) M to 8 X 10(-7), 3 X 10(-6), 1 X 10(-5) and 5 X 10(-4) M after incubation (30 min) and washout of increasing concentrations of SZL-49. Surprisingly, SZL-49, irrespective of the dose or incubation time, did not decrease the maximal response of aortic rings to norepinephrine. This resulted in a norepinephrine dose-response curve after SZL-treatment that is parallel to the control. SZL-49 had no effect on the spasmogenic actions of histamine, serotonin, KCl or CaCl2. In contrast to the inhibitory pattern seen with SZL-49, incubation with 10(-7) M phenoxybenzamine shifted the norepinephrine dose-response curve to the right in a nonparallel manner and significantly depressed the maximal response obtainable with norepinephrine. Incubation with 10(-6) M phenoxybenzamine for 30 min virtually abolished the response to norepinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine (10(-7) M) was without effect on aortic rings treated with a maximally effective dose of SZL-49. Prazosin weakly antagonized the contractile actions of norepinephrine observed after SZL-49 treatment, whereas yohimbine was without effect on these norepinephrine-induced contractions. In control binding studies [3H]prazosin bound to two classes of sites in both aorta and brain preparations. Affinities and densities for these sites were K1 = 67.5 pM, K2 = 309 pM; R1 = 38.2 fmol/mg, R2 = 46.47 fmol/mg in aorta and K1 = 29.6 pM, K2 = 182 pM; R1 = 6.6 fmol/mg and R2 = 30.4 fmol/mg in brain. Treatment with increasing amounts of SZL-49 (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) progressively reduced the number of [3H]prazosin sites without altering the affinity of the sites remaining. At 10(-7) M, SZL-49 eliminated completely all specific [3H]prazosin binding. Our results indicate that the site mediating norepinephrine contraction after treatment with SZL-49 does not possess the characteristics of an alpha-1 receptor and supports the hypothesis that a low affinity site for norepinephrine and prazosin exists in vascular smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The absence of osmotic sensitivity indicated weak base binding and little or no transport into the brush border membrane vesicles at pH 7.4. Benzylamine binding was increased 30-fold when medium pH was increased from 7.0 to 9.0, which indicated binding of the nonionized form of benzylamine. Uptake of benzylamine into an osmotically sensitive space was observed at pH 9.0 in the presence of NaCl and no osmotic sensitivity was observed in the presence of KCl. The apparent energy of activation of benzylamine binding was 8.4 kCal/mol which is higher than values normally associated with a simple physical process such as diffusion or partition into the membrane. Benzylamine binding was saturable and two binding sites (KD = 25 microM, KD = 2.5 mM) were discriminated. Inhibition experiments with structurally related compounds indicated a high degree of structural selectivity for the binding sites. Analysis of inhibition patterns indicated that the amine nitrogen may act as a hydrogen acceptor for hydrogen bond formation. These results indicate binding of nonionized primary amines to specific sites on intestinal brush border membranes. The binding of primary amines may be important as a step in translocation and/or membrane discrimination between ionized and nonionized weak bases.\r"

  ".W": "Hypothyroid, hyperthyroid and euthyroid rats were given 45 or 80 mg/kg i.v. or 100 mg/kg p.o. of amiodarone hydrochloride to determine the effects of thyroid dysfunction on the absorption and disposition characteristics of amiodarone. Serial blood samples were obtained for 48 hr and assayed for amiodarone and desethylamiodarone by high-performance liquid chromatography. In the hypothyroid rats, reductions in amiodarone clearance (CL) of 73% (26.9-7.3 ml/min/kg) and 61% (18.7-7.3 ml/min/kg) were observed with the 45- and 80-mg/kg i.v. bolus doses, respectively. Accompanying the decreases in CL were increases in the terminal disposition half-life (T1/2 gamma), 89% (18-34 hr) with the 45-mg/kg dose and 185% (20-57 hr) after the 80-mg/kg dose. The steady state (Vss) and apparent (Vd) volumes of distribution were smaller at the lower dose but were invariant after administration of the larger dose. Furthermore, the central compartment volume was not altered. In the hyperthyroid rats, a 67% increase in CL (12.8-21.4 ml/min/kg) and 75 to 80% increases in Vss (15.5-27.1 liters/kg) and Vd (25.0-44.8 liters/kg) were observed with the 45-mg/kg of amiodarone dose. However, no changes in CL, Vd and Vss were seen with the 80-mg/kg dose. Furthermore, gamma, T1/2 gamma and central compartment volume were not altered in the hyperthyroid rats. The effects of thyroid dysfunction on the p.o. bioavailability characteristics of amiodarone were minor. These studies demonstrated that the disposition kinetics of amiodarone are altered in hypo- and hyperthyroidism.\r"

It has been suggested that the extent of drug-protein binding may influence the magnitude of cardiotoxicity associated with tricyclic antidepressant overdose. To study this question, desipramine (DMI), 45 mg/kg, was administered i.p. to anesthetized rats, producing an increase in QRS duration of 86.4 +/- 20.5% and a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 28.1 +/- 13.2%. Groups of six rats then received human AAG, 2.2 g/kg i.v. over 30 min, 4.4 g/kg i.v. over 60 min or control infusions of albumin. The serum AAG concentration increased to 29 times normal after AAG, 2.2 g/kg, and 46 times normal after AAG, 4.4 g/kg. The serum DMI concentration did not change with albumin infusion but increased 4.7-fold (1.9 +/- 0.7 to 9.0 +/- 1.6 micrograms/ml) after AAG, 2.2 g/kg, and 6.7-fold (2.3 +/- 0.5 to 15.7 +/- 7.0 micrograms/ml) after AAG, 4.4 g/kg. AAG infusion at either dose had no effect on systolic blood pressure compared to albumin. Animals treated with AAG, 2.2 g/kg, had less QRS prolongation 30 min after AAG infusion than animals treated with albumin (41 +/- 13% vs. 64 +/- 8%, P less than .01) but no difference in QRS duration was observed between groups after the higher dose (4.4 g/kg) of AAG or albumin. Cardiac DMI concentrations 90 min after AAG or albumin treatments did not differ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rats were trained to discriminate the novel analgesic flupirtine (10.0 mg/kg i.p., 10 min) from no drug under a two-choice fixed-ratio 5 shock-termination schedule. Flupirtine yielded a dose-response curve with an ED50 of 3.87 mg/kg. The opioid analgesics pentazocine, codeine and tramadol failed to produce flupirtine appropriate responding. The opioid antagonist naltrexone did not antagonize the discriminative effects of flupirtine. The mixed alpha-1/alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine and the highly specific alpha-2 adrenergic agonist UK-14304, both partially and dose-dependently produced flupirtine appropriate responding. The mixed alpha-1/alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine and the highly specific alpha-2 antagonists idazoxan and L-654,284 all partially and dose-dependently antagonized flupirtine appropriate responding. Neither of the alpha-1 agonists phenylephrine or ST 587 produced flupirtine appropriate responding, nor did the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin antagonize flupirtine responding. It is concluded that the discriminative effects of flupirtine are neither of opioid nor of alpha-1 adrenergic type, but are primarily mediated through alpha-2 adrenergic mechanisms.\r"

  ".U": "88332634\r", 
  ".W": "It has been shown that catheter implantation in rats increases concentrations of propranolol and this is usually explained by the increased serum protein binding of propranolol, as a consequence of the higher serum alpha-1-acid glycoprotein concentration. We investigated in this study whether this increase in propranolol concentration after p.o. administration is not also due to a decreased first pass metabolism. We therefore studied in rats the pharmacokinetics and the in vitro metabolism by hepatocytes, of propranolol and antipyrine, 2 and 48 hr after catheter implantation. After p.o. administration of propranolol, the area under the serum concentration time curve 48 hr after catheter implantation was increased 4-fold as compared to 2 hr. As the unbound propranolol fraction was decreased only by a factor of two, it can be concluded that the hepatic intrinsic clearance was decreased, and this was confirmed by a decreased metabolizing activity in the isolated hepatocytes of these animals. After i.v. administration of antipyrine, the systemic clearance was decreased, the volume of distribution was unchanged and the half-life was increased 48 hr after catheter implantation. As antipyrine is a low extraction drug and is not bound to serum proteins, the decreased systemic clearance suggests a lower hepatic intrinsic clearance, and this was again confirmed by a decreased metabolizing activity in the isolated hepatocytes. These results confirm the important effect of the presence of indwelling catheters on the serum concentrations of antipyrine and propranolol, and suggest that this effect is the result of both an increased serum binding and a decreased hepatic metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were carried out to characterize the pharmacological properties of enantiomers and racemic mixture of dobutamine to modulate the myocardial contractility through alpha and beta adrenoceptors in the rabbit papillary muscle. Dobutamine caused the concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect: the rank order of potency was R-(+)- greater than (+/-) - greater than S-(-)-dobutamine. The positive inotropic effect of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)-dobutamine was antagonized by a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-bupranolol in a competitive manner, but was not affected by an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The concentration-response curve for (-)-phenylephrine mediated by alpha adrenoceptors in the presence of 10(-6) M (+/-)-bupranolol was shifted by enantiomers of dobutamine to the right in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, enantiomers of dobutamine antagonized the positive inotropic effect of (-)-phenylephrine in a competitive manner, and pA2 values [negative logarithm of the dissociation constant (KB)] for (+)- and (-)-dobutamine were 6.67 and 5.99, respectively. The specific binding of [3H]prazosin to membrane fractions of rabbit ventricular myocardium was displaced by dobutamine with a high potency: the -log Ki values for (+)- and (-)-dobutamine were 6.43 and 5.97, respectively, which correspond well with pA2 values of these compounds for functional modification. These findings indicate that enantiomers of dobutamine elicit the positive inotropic effect through activation of beta adrenoceptors, whereas both enantiomers behave as the competitive antagonist of myocardial alpha adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic effect in the isolated rabbit papillary muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The diuretic, triamterene, had been regarded to be a drug which was actively transported by the placenta from fetus to mother. In the present study, the transfer of triamterene across the isolated perfused human placenta was examined. Placentas obtained at cesarean section were perfused for up to 2 hr from both maternal and fetal sides in either single-pass or recycling constant flow systems. In single-pass experiments, the placental clearance of triamterene (400 ng/ml) from mother to fetus or from fetus to mother was examined (n = 8). Antipyrine (20 micrograms/ml) and l-leucine (0.25 mM) were used as reference compounds. The transplacental clearance index (i.e., clearance relative to antipyrine clearance) of triamterene from mother to fetus (0.85 +/- 0.10) was similar to the clearance index from fetus to mother (0.74 +/- 0.08, P greater than .10), indicating rapid transfer across the placenta, but no active fetal to maternal transport. In contrast, the l-leucine clearance index from mother to fetus (0.62 +/- 0.05) was substantially greater than that from fetus to mother (0.27 +/- 0.03, P less than .01), consistent with active maternal to fetal transport. In recycling experiments (n = 5), with test compounds added in equal concentration to both maternal and fetal circuits, the equilibrium fetal/maternal perfusate concentration ratios were 1.41 +/- 0.02 for l-leucine and 0.98 +/- 0.01 for antipyrine. The slightly lower value for triamterene (0.92 +/- 0.02) probably reflected minor differences in protein binding between maternal and fetal circuits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Carvedilol inhibited the NE-induced depolarization in the artery but not in vein, with potencies equivalent to prazosin, i.e., carvedilol blocked alpha 1 adrenoceptors in arterial smooth muscles. Stimulation of perivascular nerves evoked an excitatory junction potential (e.j.p.) and a slow depolarization in these vascular smooth muscles. Carvedilol inhibited the slow depolarization evoked in the artery but not in the vein, with no marked inhibition of the e.j.p.s. High concentrations (10(-5) M) of carvedilol inhibited the e.j.p., slow depolarization, and also the compound action potentials of sympathetic nerve bundles running along the mesenteric vessels, suggesting that these inhibitions were due to local anesthetic actions. The e.j.p. amplitude was increased by isoprenaline and was decreased by NE. The NE and isoprenaline actions were antagonized by yohimbine and propranolol, respectively. Carvedilol inhibited the isoprenaline-actions but not the NE actions on the e.j.p., suggesting that this drug blocked prejunctional beta adrenoceptors but not the alpha 2 adrenoceptors. These results indicate that carvedilol blocks alpha 1 and beta adrenoceptors but not alpha 2 adrenoceptors in vascular tissues.\r"

Either carbachol (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) or muscarine (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) dose-dependently inhibited extracellular action potentials orthodromically elicited by local stimulation in the CN. A combination of acetylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-4) M) with physostigmine (10(-6) M) also inhibited the orthodromic response of CN neuron, but nicotine (10(-6) to 10(-3) M) had no effects on the neuronal activity. Atropine (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) antagonized the carbachol-induced inhibition of CN neuron with pA2 of 7.58. Carbachol (10(-5) M) or muscarine (10(-5) M) decreased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) without altering the resting membrane potential or input impedance of the CN neuron, whereas nicotine (10(-5) M) did not affect either the resting membrane potential or amplitude of EPSP. When carbachol (10(-5) M) was added to the bath, the number of action potentials elicited by applying a depolarizing current into the cell was increased, whereas action potentials transsynaptically elicited by local stimulation were inhibited conversely. The excitatory effects of carbachol on the postsynaptic site of the neuron were also blocked by atropine (3 x 10(-7) M). Carbachol (10(-5) M) did not affect the time courses of the rise and decay phases of EPSP induced by the local stimulation, but did reduce the amplitude of the EPSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In model 1, animals trained in a T-maze were allowed to choose between 2 magnitudes of reward: immediate but small reward (2 pellets) vs. a 25-sec delayed but large reward (10 pellets). Under this alternative, vehicle-injected rats selected the large-but-delayed reward in less than 40% of the trials. Desipramine 8 mg/kg, clomipramine 8 mg/kg, maprotiline 8 mg/kg, indalpine 2 to 4 mg/kg, zimelidine 8 to 16 mg/kg, nialamide 16 to 32 mg/kg and clenbuterol 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg significantly increased the number of choices of the large-but-delayed reward. In model 2, rats were subjected to a fixed ratio 48 schedule of food reinforcement; after completion of a series of exactly 48 presses a food pellet was delivered, and if no further press occurred, a sequence of free pellets was initiated according to fixed, increasing intervals (from 5-80 sec). Pressing during the sequence stopped it and required the rat to complete again the fixed ratio 48 to be reinforced and to reintiate the sequence. Waiting for free reward was significantly lengthened by desipramine 8, clomipramine 16, indalpine 8, zimelidine 8 to 16, nialamide 32 and clenbuterol 0.007 to 0.06 mg/kg. These results suggest that, possibly through noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms, antidepressants markedly enhanced rats' ability to wait for food reward, an affect which might reflect the ability of these drugs to improve impulse control. The relevance of such a property in the therapeutic action of antidepressants remains to be delineated.\r"

Conventional and ion-selective microelectrodes were used to determine basolateral membrane potential, intracellular Cl- activity and luminal activities of Cl- and K+. Muzolimine depolarized basolateral membrane potential by about 30 mV in 1 min, in a reversible fashion. We attributed this depolarization to blockade of a K+ conductance, because the effects of muzolimine and barium on the highly K-selective basolateral membrane were not additive. In addition, muzolimine elicited a reversible increase of intracellular Cl- activity from 7.5 +/- 0.5 to 14.5 +/- 2.6 mM (concomitant to the basolateral membrane potential depolarization) and of luminal activities of Cl- from 12.4 +/- 1.5 to 22.3 +/- 2.5 mM, within approximately 1 min; both disturbances relaxed toward control values after withdrawal of the diuretic. That muzolimine increases Cl- activity in both the cell and the lumen of the late distal tubule (Cl- is accumulated in these compartments), indicates that retention of Cl- results from hindrance of the basolateral exit step rather than of apical Cl- uptake. Inasmuch as muzolimine failed to increase the luminal activity of K+, Cl- is believed to accumulate in the lumen as NaCl, not KCl.\r"

When injected through indwelling intrathecal (i.t.) catheters terminating at L1 to L2, both peptides were significantly more potent producing paralysis 1 day, rather than 10 to 14 days, after i.t. catheterization. Other rats received direct subarachnoid injections of these peptides through 30-gauge needles placed in the L4 to L5 intervertebral space. In naive, uncatheterized and acutely catheterized rats, direct intervertebral injection of these peptides, as well as D-Ala2-Dyn A (1-13) amide (a metabolically stable analog of Dyn A (1-13), produced hindlimb paralysis with potencies comparable to those recorded after injections through acutely implanted catheters. In contrast, chronically catheterized rats showed significantly reduced responsivity to direct intervertebral injections of all three of these peptides. Loss of hindlimb motor function was associated with loss of nociceptive responsiveness. Elevations in tail-flick latencies were only seen with doses of Dyn A (1-13) which produced motor dysfunction, and were not blocked or reversed by high doses of the opioid antagonist naloxone. These results indicate that: 1) indwelling i.t. catheters induce spinal cord alterations which complicate their experimental usefulness, 2) Dyn A (1-13) does not alter responsiveness to thermal nociceptive stimuli through opioid mechanism and 3) Dyn A (1-13) causes parallel disruptions of spinal cord motor and nociceptive function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The kappa opioid agonist dynorphin A (Dyn A) (1-13) produced dose-related neurological deficits after subarachnoid injection in the lumbar spinal cords of rats. Whereas the neurological dysfunctions produced by low doses of Dyn A (1-13) were transient, higher doses caused persistent deficits, characterized by motor and nociceptive impairment in hindlimbs and tail, hindlimb edema, priapism, bladder infarction and atony and urinary incontinence. These deficits appeared to result from nonopioid actions of Dyn A (1-13), as they were: 1) not blocked by the opioid antagonists naloxone or WIN 44,441-3; 2) shared by Dyn A (3-13), which lacks opioid activity; and 3) not produced or altered by the selective kappa opioid agonist U 50,488. Coinjection of a combination of peptidase inhibitors, shown previously to enhance the actions of Dyn A fragments in vitro, significantly increased the paralytic actions of Dyn A (1-13). The peptidase inhibitors did not by themselves cause neurological dysfunction, and they did not alter the paralytic potency of the peptidase-resistant delta opioid antagonist ICI 174864. These findings indicate that Dyn A effects were: 1) limited appreciably by its rapid enzymatic degradation after injection and 2) most likely the result of actions of the intact peptide rather than proteolytic products generated after injection. Neuroanatomical evaluations revealed extensive neuronal and axonal injury in the lumbosacral spinal cords of rats injected with 25 nmol of Dyn A (1-13). Collectively, these results indicate that Dyn A (1-13) acts through nonopioid mechanisms to cause the injury and death of neurons involved in diverse spinal cord functions.\r"

  ".W": "Previous research has shown that pyridine (PY) pretreatment of rabbits elevates total hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content in association with the appearance of intense bands in the region of P-450LM4 and LM3 in the electrophoretic pattern of the microsomes and increased rates of PY N-oxide production and N-nitrosodimethylamine, alcohol and aniline metabolism. In the present study, PY administration (100 mg/kg i.p., 4 days) to rats was found to elevate hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 content approximately 2.5-fold as compared to controls. Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a protein band of enhanced intensity migrating in the region of P-450j, the major ethanol-inducible form of rat liver cytochrome P-450. Immunochemical analysis confirmed that the level of immunoreactive P-450j protein was increased in PY-induced microsomes as compared to preparations from control, phenobarbital- or beta-naphthoflavone-induced animals. The rate of PY N-oxide production was enhanced 4-fold in PY-induced microsomes relative to untreated controls and was approximately 1.5- to 2-fold greater than that monitored for either phenobarbital- or beta-naphthoflavone-induced microsomes. When data were normalized for increased P-450 content, an altered substrate specificity was suggested for the PY-induced microsomes. para-Nitrophenol hydroxylase activity, which is exhibited primarily by the ethanol-inducible form of P-450, was elevated approximately 4-fold in PY-induced microsomes relative to uninduced microsomes and, when expressed per nanomol of P-450, was approximately 2- to 3-fold greater in PY-induced preparations as compared to phenobarbital-, beta-naphthoflavone-induced, or uninduced microsomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The binary toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, also known as type C2 toxin, was examined for its ability to alter the structure and function of Y-1 cells, a murine adrenocortical tumor line. The toxin produced time- and concentration-dependent changes in morphology, characterized by retraction of cell extensions and by rounding of the cell body. These changes were not accompanied by increases or decreases in tissue levels of c-AMP or c-GMP, although there was an increase in the release of total steroids. When cells were exposed to toxin for 24 hr there was no evidence of cell death or lysis. Total nucleic acid content and the rate of incorporation of 14C-leucine into protein were comparable in control cells and intoxicated cells. The toxin has been shown to possess mono(ADP-ribosyl)ating activity, and actin is the presumed substrate. When Y-1 cells were ruptured and then exposed to the toxin in the presence of 32P-NAD, actin was ADP-ribosylated. When cells were exposed to the toxin before being ruptured, there was a subsequent loss in the amount of actin that was available for ADP-ribosylation (32P-NAD) in the broken cell assay. The data suggest that Y-1 cells can survive challenge with the botulinum binary toxin, and thus they are a suitable tissue in which to use the toxin as a pharmacological tool.\r"

  ".U": "88332651\r", 
  ".W": "C6-2B rat astrocytoma cells were used to test whether the increase of cellular nerve growth factor (NGF) content and secretion induced by isoproterenol treatment are associated with an increase in the content of mRNA that encodes NGF (NGF mRNA). Incubation of cells with isoproterenol (10 microM) for different time periods produced an increase of NGF mRNA content (3- to 5-fold over control) reaching maximum levels at 3 hr and lasting up to 24 hr. The isoproterenol effect on NGF mRNA was antagonized by the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist I-propranolol (10 microM) but not by phentolamine (10 microM), an alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist. When C6-2B astrocytoma cells were exposed for a short time to isoproterenol (10 microM; 10 or 20 min) followed by a washout period of 3 hr, the NGF mRNA content was increased by about 2-fold. The increase of NGF mRNA was obtained also with 10 microM prostaglandin E1 and this effect was potentiated by 100 microM of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Inasmuch as both isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1 increase cyclic AMP content, one can surmise that cyclic AMP is involved in the stimulation of NGF mRNA accumulation. Whether cyclic AMP directly activates NGF gene transcription or activates an intermediate step, however, cannot be assessed by the present experiments.\r"

  ".U": "88332654\r", 
  ".W": "Fenfluramine is an anorectic agent in clinical use that is believed to act by enhancing 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurotransmission. Tolerance to the anorectic properties of fenfluramine develops rapidly and long-lasting depletions of brain 5-HT have been reported to occur after repeated administration. It is possible that tolerance to fenfluramine may be related to the 5-HT depletions. Rats (n = 96), previously allowed to drink sweetened condensed milk during daily 15-min sessions, were treated with fenfluramine (6.25 mg/kg/12 hr x 4 days) or saline. Two or 8 weeks later rats were administered fenfluramine acutely (0, 1.25, 6.25 or 12.5 mg/kg; n = 6/group), tested for milk intake and sacrificed 2 hr later. Brains were removed and regions assayed for dopamine, 5-HT and metabolites. Acute administration of fenfluramine produced a dose-dependent decrease in milk intake and 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. Tolerance to the effects of acute fenfluramine on milk intake was observed in rats at 2 weeks (ED50 = 3.24 vs. 6.37 mg/kg; saline vs. fenfluramine pretreatment, respectively) and, to a lesser extent, at 8 weeks (ED50 = 2.99 vs. 4.04 mg/kg; saline vs. fenfluramine pretreatment) after the 4-day regimen of fenfluramine. Levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus, striatum and hippocampus were depleted significantly 2 weeks after the last daily fenfluramine injection. The acute 5-HT depleting effect of fenfluramine was markedly attenuated in these regions 2 weeks after the 4-day regimen of fenfluramine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88332655\r", 
  ".W": "The binding profile of the positively charged muscarinic antagonist, gallamine, was studied in rat heart homogenates. A proportion of the binding sites labeled by the tertiary muscarinic ligands [( 3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and [3H]atropine) were inaccessible to their quaternary analogs [( 3H]N-methyl-QNB (NMeQNB) and [3H]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS)] or gallamine. Whereas gallamine displaced the binding of [3H]NMeQNB with high affinity, biphasic competition curves were observed using [3H]NMS only at higher ligand concentrations. The rank order of potency of gallamine in allosterically decelerating ligand dissociation kinetics was: [3H]NMS greater than [3H]atropine greater than [3H]NMeQNB greater than [3H]QNB. Our calculations demonstrate that the displayed heterogeneity of gallamine binding sites detected using [3H]NMS, but not the tertiary ligands, might be accounted for by the allosteric modification of the binding of this ligand by gallamine. Based on these findings, the exhibited binding profile of gallamine to muscarinic receptors is influenced strongly by ligand choice, and also by the ligand concentration used in the binding experiment. Furthermore, it is concluded that gallamine binds to three major sites on the muscarinic receptor, thereby revealing an apparent heterogeneity of its binding sites, even in a tissue which presumably possesses one major muscarinic receptor subtype such as the heart. According to several lines of evidence, gallamine binds competitively and with high affinity to NMS-accessible sites on the receptor. Under certain experimental conditions, it also appears to identify another low-affinity site, either due to its binding to NMS-inaccessible sites or through its differential ability to alter the binding of ligands to the main binding domain on the receptor in an allosteric fashion.\r"

The presence of forskolin exaggerated the response to acetylcholine. Intraocular injection of the cholinotoxin AF64A resulted in apparent supersensitivity of the response to acetylcholine.

Synaptic potentials were studied using extracellular, intracellular and single-electrode voltage clamp techniques. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded from the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells after Schaffer collateral stimulation. Intracellularly recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells after mossy fiber stimulation and in the presence of 10 microM picrotoxinin. In the CA1 region, phenytoin elicited a reversible depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials as well as reduced the time constant of decay of PTP from 79 sec to 47 sec with no change in the magnitude of potentiation. Higher concentrations of phenytoin (100 microM) had a general depressant effect on both the amplitude and time course of PTP. In CA3 cells, phenytoin (10 microM) reduced the mossy fiber synaptic conductance but did not change its reversal potential. Phenytoin (10 microM) also reduced the time constant of decay of PTP of the mossy fiber to CA3 synapse, while having no effect on the magnitude of potentiation. These results show that therapeutically relevant concentrations of phenytoin depress both low-frequency synaptic transmission and the time course of short-term potentiation. Both actions may be involved in the anticonvulsant properties of phenytoin.\r"

Perivascular application (0.1, 1.0 and 10 mumol) of the four Mg salts on the microvessels attenuated the vasoconstrictor actions of both epinephrine and BaCl2, dose-dependently. With respect to arterioles, the vasoconstriction induced by BaCl2 was inhibited more potently by each Mg salt than that induced by epinephrine; the reverse was observed with respect to the venules. MgCl2 displayed the most potent antagonism to the constriction induced by BaCl2 in arterioles as well as by epinephrine in venules. Infusion of each Mg salt in very low doses (e.g., 0.1 mumol/min i.a.) resulted in significant attenuation of the arteriolar constrictions induced by both stimulants. However, the difference in the degree of attenuation on i.a. infusion of each Mg salt was significantly less than that observed by perivascular pretreatment. Arteriolar constrictions induced by epinephrine and BaCl2 were also attenuated by systemic i.v. infusion of each Mg salt, except for MgSO4, when low doses (e.g., 0.1 and 1.0 mumol/min.) were given; surprisingly, high dose i.v. infusion (10 and 20 mumol/min) often potentiated arteriolar constrictions induced by both stimulants, but the magnitude of this potentiation depended on the Mg salt utilized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In animals trained to discriminate LSD (0.08 mg/kg) from saline (n = 8), LSD-like responding occurred during substitution (generalization) tests with sufficiently high doses of (+/- )-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, LSD, mescaline, psilocybin and (-)-MDA; saline appropriate responding occurred after (+)-MDA and both (+)- and (+)- and (-)-MDMA. In animals trained to discriminate mescaline (10 mg/kg; n = 8), (-)-MDA, (+)-MDA, (-)-MDMA and (+)-MDMA as well as (+/- )-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine, LSD, mescaline and psilocybin mimicked the training drug. Neither (+)-amphetamine nor cocaine produced mescaline-like responding; fenfluramine substituted partially for mescaline but not LSD. Because all of the phenylisopropylamine enantiomers mimicked the potent hallucinogen mescaline (10 mg/kg), these results do not support suggestions that similarities in the behavioral effects of \"designer\" drugs such as MDA and MDMA to those of hallucinogens are limited to (-)-MDA. They also indicate that, although LSD and mescaline may be pharmacologically similar (in other assays), these compounds do not have identical stimulus properties.\r"

One purpose of this study was to determine whether mechanisms of action suggested from in vitro studies of these compounds could be demonstrated over clinically relevant dose ranges in vivo. The data demonstrate that drugs capable of antagonizing gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition produced similar effects on the intact hippocampus. Bicuculline, picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol and the insecticide lindane increased granule cell excitability to perforant path stimulation. The primary cause of this was an increase in the innate excitability of the granule cells. These compounds also modified field potentials in a manner consistent with a reduction in early GABA-mediated inhibition. They did not affect synaptically mediated facilitation. The magnitudes of the effects were dose dependent, and changes were clearly measurable at exposures that produce clinical effects in nonanesthetized rats. Other convulsants could be readily differentiated from those affecting GABA-mediated inhibition. Kainic acid depressed granule cell responses to perforant path stimulation and severely depressed both inhibition and facilitation. A decrease in granule cell responsiveness was also produced by exposure to beta carboline. Exposure to strychnine had little effect on granule cell excitability. These data indicate that for bicuculline, picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol and lindane, an apparently selective antagonism of GABA-mediated inhibition is clearly demonstrable at exposures that also produce clinical intoxication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "88332664\r", 
  ".W": "Two etiologically different models of experimental acute renal failure were induced in rats by administration of either glycerol or uranyl nitrate. Both compounds caused a substantial decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the net tubular secretion of tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB) and para-aminohippuric acid (PAH). The degree of renal impairment induced by uranyl nitrate and glycerol appeared to be dose related. Deprivation of drinking water 24 hr before the administration of glycerol potentiated the renal damage. In uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure, the decline of the net tubular secretion for TEAB and PAH was not proportional to the decrease in GFR; the secretion process deteriorated faster than the GFR. For example, when 0.5 mg/kg uranyl nitrate was administered, GFR fell to approximately 65% of normal, whereas the net tubular secretion was decreased to 30% of normal. These results suggest that the tubular transport was preferentially affected by uranyl nitrate. In contrast, in glycerol-induced renal failure, the decline of TEAB secretion fell in a parallel fashion with the GFR, suggesting that the glomeruli and the proximal tubules were equally damaged by glycerol. However, in this latter model, the decline of PAH secretion did not parallel the decrease in GFR, contradicting the proposal that glycerol affects equally the glomeruli and the proximal tubules. This discrepancy may be due to the selective competitive inhibition of PAH secretion by the accumulation of naturally occurring organic acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Calcium-dependent release of [3H]dopamine was elicited by electrical stimulation at 3 Hz for 2 min (20 mA, 2 msec). Melatonin (5-OCH3-N-acetyltryptamine) and 6-chloromelatonin were equipotent in inhibiting the calcium-dependent release of [3H]dopamine (IC50 = 40 pM). 2-Substituted N-acetyltryptamines with a methyl (i.e., 6,7-dichloro-2-methylmelatonin, IC50 = 10 pM) or iodine (i.e., 2-iodomelatonin, IC50 = 5 pM) group were more potent than melatonin in inhibiting [3H]dopamine release. I report here the pharmacological properties of the novel N-acetyltryptamine, 2-benzyl-N-acetyltryptamine (N-0774, luzindole) on the presynaptic melatonin receptor of rabbit retina. Luzindole (0.1-10 microM) did not affect the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity or the stimulation-evoked release of [3H]dopamine when added alone. However, luzindole (0.1-10 microM) shifted the concentration effect curve for melatonin to the right in a parallel fashion. The pA2 extrapolated from the Schild plot (slope, 0.91) was 7.7, with a KB = 20 nM. The dissociation constants for luzindole (KB), determined in the presence of 6,7-dichloro-2-methylmelatonin (10 pM-1 nM) or 6-chloromelatonin (10 pM-100 nM) were 16 and 40 nM, respectively.

We employed 45Ca to measure agonist-mediated calcium influx and efflux, as well as tissue calcium content. In addition we labeled tissues with [3H]myoinositol to measure the effect of norepinephrine on inositol phosphate generation. Stimulation of the vas deferens with 50 mM potassium caused a rapid influx of 45Ca (6-fold). Norepinephrine stimulation, even at a concentration maximal for contraction of the tissue (1 mM), did not result in any alteration in 45Ca influx by itself but inhibited potassium-stimulated 45Ca influx (IC50 = 3 microM). This alpha receptor-mediated effect of norepinephrine was not diminished by either pretreatment with reserpine or adrenergic denervation. Studies of the efflux of 45Ca from vas deferens revealed that efflux was not affected by potassium but was significantly stimulated by norepinephrine. Alpha receptor stimulation of vas deferens smooth muscle caused a marked elevation in the appearance of inositol phosphates, particularly inositol trisphosphate, that was not dependent on extracellular calcium. We conclude that norepinephrine does not stimulate calcium influx in vas deferens smooth muscle but leads to the release of calcium from intracellular stores via formation of inositol trisphosphate and that the resulting increase in intracellular calcium may lead to inactivation of the potential-dependent calcium channel.\r"

  ".W": "Based on electrophysiological, radioligand binding, and behavioral studies in laboratory animals, it is generally believed that the psychotomimetic effects of the phenethylamine and indolealkylamine hallucinogens are mediated by central serotonin (5-HT) receptors, in particular the 5-HT-2 subtype. Agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was utilized to determine the potency and efficacy of racemic 1-(2,5)-dimethoxy-4-methyl-phenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOM), and d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at the 5-HT-2 receptor in rat cerebral cortex and the 5-HT-1c receptor in rat choroid plexus. Both DOM and LSD stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cerebral cortex. These effects were blocked by the 5-HT-2 antagonists, ketanserin and spiperone, but not by antagonists of muscarinic, alpha-1 adrenergic or histaminergic receptors. The maximum responses of DOM and LSD, respectively, were 76% and 25% of the maximum response to 5-HT. However, LSD was 500 times more potent than was racemic DOM. Consistent with a partial agonist effect, LSD partially blocked the effect of 5-HT, with a maximal inhibition equivalent to the intrinsic activity of LSD alone. In choroid plexus, DOM and LSD stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and both responses were blocked by mianserin and less effectively by spiperone. The maximum effect of DOM was 67% of that of 5-HT, whereas the maximum effect of LSD was only 34% of the maximum response of 5-HT. LSD was 50 times more potent than was racemic DOM. LSD partially antagonized the effect of 5-HT in the choroid plexus, consistent with a partial agonist effect at the 5-HT-1c receptor in this tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Parotid acinar cells, prepared from pharmacologically sympathectomized adult rats (reserpine, 0.1 mg/kg/day for 1 week), display decreased responsiveness to beta adrenergic stimulation in vitro compared to cells from control and surgically sympathectomized rats. Both methods of denervation increase amylase content (amylase activity per microgram of DNA). Percent release of amylase activity and percent release of CCl3COOH-precipitable [14C]leucine were used as indicators of protein secretion. Exposure of cells from pharmacologically sympathectomized rats to the beta adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, resulted in a marked reduction in receptor-coupled secretion (67% and 75% relative to controls, respectively). 8-Bromo-cyclic AMP, like isoproterenol, was unable to surmount this reserpine-induced inhibition of stimulated secretion, suggesting that an alteration in receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling is not responsible for the observed secretion defect. Cells prepared from surgically sympathectomized rats displayed modest decreases in stimulated secretion when the same secretory markers were monitored (30% and 25% relative to controls, respectively). The number of beta adrenoreceptors [( 3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites) increased (35%), with no change in binding affinity, in membrane preparations from reserpine-treated rats. Thus, the observed inhibition of beta adrenergic agonist-induced secretion is not likely the result of alterations in beta adrenergic receptor characteristics. Short-term (1 week) surgical denervation had no effect on the number of beta adrenergic receptor sites; however, an increase in ligand binding affinity was noted. The decrease in the apparent Kd (30%) was not the result of a shift in receptor subtype as determined by competition studies with specific beta-1 (atenolol) and beta-2 (ICI 118,551) receptor antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Morphine, ethylketazocine and dynorphin A served as reference compounds. After 70 hr of infusion from s.c. implanted osmotic minipumps, three levels of abstinence were associated with the injection of naloxone (3 mg/kg s.c.): 1) negligible syndromes (scores of less than 21) were obtained in rats on water or the kappa-directed ligands, U-50,488H and dynorphin A; 2) a low-to-moderate abstinence score (37-38) was recorded with rats receiving [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin and ethylketazocine; and 3) a high abstinence score (64-73) was obtained with rats on morphine and DAGO. These results reinforce the concept of developing selective, nonbenzomorphan kappa agonists as clinically useful analgesics and emphasize that, when evaluating new analgesics, high selectivity for delta receptors does not, in itself, guarantee freedom from physical dependence.\r"

  ".W": "In the present investigation, experiments were performed in order to determine whether antidepressants are capable of inducing regionally specific adaptation of beta adrenergic and 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptors after chronic administration or when combined with the forced swim test. The drugs tested were imipramine, amitriptyline, pargyline and nomifensine. The regional pattern of beta adrenergic or 5-HT2 receptor binding changes induced after chronic treatment with these antidepressants was not uniform. All of the drugs reduced [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to cortical membranes after chronic treatment but only two, imipramine and pargyline, did so in hippocampus. All of the antidepressants reduced cortical, but not hippocampal, beta adrenergic receptor binding after 2 days of treatment, indicating that the rate of antidepressant-induced neural adaptation is regionally specific. All of the drugs, except nomifensine, induced down regulation of both cortical and hippocampal 5-HT2 receptors after chronic treatment, as measured by [3H]ketanserin binding. The forced swim test accelerated the reduction of [3H] dihydroalprenolol binding in hippocampus induced by imipramine and pargyline while producing no further effect on cortical beta adrenergic receptors. The down-regulation of hippocampal, but not cortical 5-HT2 receptors by imipramine and pargyline was also facilitated in rats processed in the forced swim test. These results provide further support for the view that the forced swim antidepressant drug screen may be of heuristic value as a model of the adaptive neural mechanisms that accompany chronic antidepressant drug treatment. Furthermore, these data provide evidence that multiple neural mechanisms may be involved in the adaptive changes after antidepressant drug treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of the carbamates pyridostigmine and physostigmine to protect against the lethal effects of soman, an extremely toxic anticholinesterase agent, was measured in rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. Pharmacologically equivalent doses of these carbamates that inhibited 70% of the blood acetylcholinesterase in each species were injected i.m. 25 min before s.c. injection with soman. Pretreatment with either carbamate, in combination with 17.4 mg/kg of atropine, produced protection against soman toxicity in all species. When protection was expressed as the ratio between the soman LD50 values in carbamate-protected animals and control animals, this protective ratio varied 3-fold between species (2.1-6.1 for pyridostigmine; 2.2-6.6 for physostigmine). When protection was expressed as the difference in the soman LD50 values between carbamate-protected animals and control animals, this protective difference was consistent among species (126 +/- 19 micrograms/kg). Species variation in protective ratios was observed largely because the control LD50 values defining soman toxicity in unprotected animals varied among species (20 micrograms/kg in rabbits, 28 micrograms/kg in guinea pigs and 126 micrograms/kg in rats). The species variation of the soman LD50 values in control animals was eliminated by pretreating animals with cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide, which reduced the species variation in soman detoxification. The LD50 values for soman in cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide-treated animals (9.8-15.6 micrograms/kg) did not differ significantly between species. Similarly, protective ratios for carbamates against soman in cresylbenzodioxaphosphorin oxide-treated animals were also clustered in a narrow range (8.5-11.4 for pyridostigmine; 9.0-13.4 for physostigmine) that did not differ significantly, regardless of species or carbamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When chloroquine was injected immediately after the injection of venom, the median lethal dose (LD50) of the venom was increased 5-fold from 19 to 95 micrograms/kg. Investigation of chloroquine's effect on the purified neurotoxic components of B. multicinctus venom revealed that chloroquine increased the LD50 of beta-bungarotoxin 17-fold, from 7.8 to 134 micrograms/kg but had little effect on the LD50 of alpha-bungarotoxin. Chloroquine was an effective antagonist of the toxicity of B. multicinctus venom and of purified beta-bungarotoxin without itself being overtly toxic.\r"

To evaluate the regional arterial effects of PAF and its interaction with cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, we infused increasing doses of PAF (calculated to achieve an initial plasma concentration of 2 X 10(-9), 10(-8), 5 X 10(-8) M) into the gastric, mesenteric and femoral arteries in the presence or absence of indomethacin (5 mg/kg) in anesthetized dogs. During a 5-min infusion of PAF, regional resistances in the gastric, mesenteric and femoral arterial circulations decreased transiently and dose dependently in the initial phase (minute 1 and 2) by 71, 65 and 64%, respectively. In the late phase (minute 3-5), the arterial resistance returned gradually toward base line in the gastric and mesenteric circulations but remained reduced in the femoral arterial circulation. In the vehicle-treated group, the effect of PAF was reproducible. In the indomethacin-treated group, the initial vasodilator response to PAF was not altered in any of the arterial circulations, but in the late phase, the return of arterial resistance toward base line in the gastric and mesenteric circulations was attenuated by indomethacin (P less than .05). In contrast, in the femoral circulation, indomethacin enhanced the return of the arterial resistance (P less than .05) toward base line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
