The mean concentrations required to inhibit human scleral fibroblast proliferation to 50% of the control rate (ID50) after 5 days of exposure were 8.50 micrograms/mL for F3TDR and 0.43 microgram/mL for 5-FU. The corresponding ID50 levels for rabbit corneal epithelial cells were 0.24 microgram/mL and 0.42 microgram/mL. The ID50 of F3TDR was significantly higher than that of 5-FU in human scleral fibroblasts (p less than 0.001) but not in rabbit corneal epithelial cells. F3TDR appears to have no clinical advantage over 5-FU in minimizing corneal epithelial toxicity when given to prevent fibroblast proliferation after glaucoma filtering surgery.\r"

  ".U": "87130527\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty patients with colon cancer metastatic to the liver underwent successful hepatic resection and adjuvant perioperative therapy that included hepatic arterial mitomycin C and floxuridine (FUDR). The median survival for all 20 patients was 51 months: 10 are still alive with a median postoperative follow-up of 49 months; 6 are disease-free with a median postoperative follow-up of 43 months. Among 10 patients in whom the surgical margins of the specimen contained tumor cells, the median survival was 52 months. This survival was comparable to that among 10 patients in whom the surgical margins were tumor free (P = 0.22). Neither the number of metastatic liver deposits nor the disease-free interval between the primary diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma and the development of liver metastases significantly affected survival. A transient chemical hepatitis which resolved before the next scheduled treatment was associated with 50% of arterial chemotherapy cycles (approximately 70% of the patients). Gastric or duodenal ulcerations occurred in 23% of the patients. Surgical complications were either pulmonary such as pleural effusion or atelectasis, or wound infections and subphrenic abscesses. Although these results compare favorably with the results in previously published series, this aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be particularly justified in patients with tumor positive surgical margins or those with multiple tumor masses and, therefore, are characterized by a poor prognosis.\r"

Interferon has potent antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulating properties, and therefore, this may be a good agent to treat such immune deficient patients with peripheral T-cell leukemia. During a period from April 1984 to August 1985, six patients were treated with interferon-beta (IFN-beta), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was given to five patients. Three patients achieved partial remission by IFN-beta administration with a response duration of 1, 1.5, and 12 months respectively, whereas one complete remission and two partial responses were experienced by IFN-gamma treatment with 4, 4, and 2 months of response. Side effects of IFN-beta were similar to those of IFN-gamma including fever, chills, fatigue, mild hematologic depression, and transient hepatic enzyme abnormalities. These promising results warrant further well-designed clinical trials including combination with other agents or modalities of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that the malignant transformation, in some of the acute leukemias, may involve totipotent stem cells resulting in a biphenotypic leukemia expressing both myeloid, and lymphoid characteristics. We describe here a hybrid cell acute leukemia, in a 16-day-old infant, in whom leukemic cells coexpressed myeloid and lymphoid B cell antigens. Blast cells in the bone marrow showed L2 morphology according to the French American British (FAB) classification, with positive periodic-acid Schiff, and nonspecific esterase staining. Sudan black, and specific esterase were negative. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, was strongly positive in 5% of blasts, and faintly reactive with the rest. Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a translocation of t(11:17);(q23;p13). Immunoglobulin gene analysis revealed rearrangement of the heavy chain genes. The blasts' phenotype was HLA/DR+ B4+ My7+ My9+ common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) B1- T11-. Dual immunofluorescence staining using anti My7, and My9 fluorescein isothiocyanate, and anti B4 pycoerythrin conjugated monoclonal antibodies, and flow cytofluorometry, revealed a labeling pattern of 25% B4+; 10% to 15% My7+; 17% My9+; and 50% of cells coexpressing B4 My7, and My9 antigens. These results provide evidence for a hybrid leukemia with lymphomyeloblasts being part of a single clone, which may indicate the origin of this leukemic clone from a pluripotent (lymphoid/myeloid) stem cell.\r"

Concentrations of the large neutral amino acids (LNAA) were determined in patients before and after tumor removal, and in postoperative patients before and after receiving either a standard TPN solution (STD-TPN), or a branched-chain amino acid solution (BCAA-TPN). The LNAA were altered in all groups versus normals. Brain influx rates showed the following: in preoperative patients, predicted brain tryptophan levels were below normal (P less than 0.001), whereas tyrosine levels were within or above normal; no significant differences between pre- and postoperative tryptophan or tyrosine levels; postoperative STD-TPN did not change predicted brain tryptophan concentration from preinfusion values, but BCAA-TPN decreased it (P less than 0.001), underscoring the common transport carrier; and preinfusion predicted brain tyrosine levels were decreased (P less than 0.001) by both types of TPN solutions. These results imply low substrate levels for brain serotonin and catecholamine synthesis, possibly affecting functions dependent on their control.\r"

Thirty-six percent of patients with SPB developed multiple myeloma (MM) in an average of 39 months, and 23% of patients with EMP developed MM in an average of 23 months. No significant differences in survival, incidence of MM, or interval to the development of MM were found between the two groups. The 11 cases of EMP with evaluable tissue for immunohistochemical study were either monotypic kappa or lambda, as were 9 of 10 SPB. Presence of monoclonality did not predict the development of MM. The histologic parameters of nuclear immaturity and presence of prominent nucleoli seem to be the best indicators of which patients will develop MM. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone and EMP appear to be more closely related than has been previously recognized.\r"

While the pleomorphic cells contained vimentin immunoreactivity, they were nonreactive for low or high molecular weight keratin. Flowcytometric study of paraffin-embedded tissues revealed DNA indexes of 0.75 and 1.0. Neither recurred locally nor spread distantly after therapy. Their granulation-tissue growth pattern, and the presence of stromal and endothelial cells showing similar degrees of cytologic atypia were central to their recognition as benign. These findings show that severely atypical, sometimes aneuploid, granulation-tissue reactions can occur following radiation exposure. Care should be taken not to misinterpret these lesions as malignant.\r"

Body composition and fluids were assessed the first 4 weeks following BMT, using isotope dilution and anthropometry. Oral and parenteral nutrient intakes were recorded daily. Tracer dilution techniques were used to assess body fluid volumes and estimate body cell, lean body, and body fat masses. Body cell mass was lost (mean -1.62 kg, P less than 0.05) without significant changes in body fat or lean body masses. There was an expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment (mean +0.8 l, P less than 0.05) and a loss in the intracellular fluid compartment (mean -1.3 l, P less than 0.05) with little change in total body water volume. Changes in body weight correlated poorly with body cell mass or fluid volume changes. Change in arm muscle area correlated well with changes in body cell mass (r = 0.61, P less than 0.05) and lean body mass (r = 0.68, P less than 0.05), while that of arm fat area did not reflect its isotope dilution-derived counterpart. Instead, the change in arm fat area was related to shifts in fluid compartments. Prealbumin decreased significantly (mean -9.3 mg/dl, P less than 0.05), while albumin decreased slightly (mean -0.1 mg/dl), and both were related to changes in body cell mass. Nitrogen balance was negative throughout the study and the overall mean was related to the change in body cell mass (r = 0.60, P less than 0.05). Calorie and protein intakes were not associated with the changes in body composition, implying other causal factors.\r"

Smoking induced anginal pain in three patients, triggered spasm (focal narrowing) in six, and/or an abnormal segmental diffuse narrowing (greater than 30%) in eight. The narrowing of the left CA was on average -21 +/- 13% (P less than 0.001), with more important narrowing of the mid-left anterior descending (-29 +/- 19%, P less than 0.001). The mean of the maximal segmental narrowing by patient was -34 +/- 13% (P less than 0.001). MEM produced similar effects and induced focal CA spasms in nearly the same patients at the same sites. Cigarette smoking may induce vasoconstrictive effects on CA in patients with rest angina and normal coronary angiograms. This action is not dose-dependent and may be initiated by less than one cigarette. These observations offer a new perspective for the understanding of the role of smoking in the precipitation of coronary events.\r"

By acting as renal vasodilators, atrial peptides may serve to alter peritubular capillary physical forces and favor a decrease in tubule solute reabsorption. Therefore, we studied the effects of known modifiers of intrarenal Starling forces on the natriuresis induced by infusion of intravenous hANP [4-28] (0.5 microgram/kg/min) in anesthetized, euvolemic Munich-Wistar rats. In the first series of studies, infusion of ANP resulted in a significant natriuresis, diuresis, and increase in inulin clearance and in a slight fall in systemic arterial pressure, as compared to vehicle infusion. Subsequent elevation of renal perfusion pressure by superimposition of angiotensin II infusion (0.1-0.2 microgram/kg/min i.v.) on continued ANP infusion resulted in marked further enhancement of natriuresis, independent of changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the second set of experiments, in which oncotic pressure in the postglomerular capillaries was elevated by hyperoncotic exchange transfusion, administration of ANP did not result in natriuresis, even though GFR increased by the same magnitude as that seen in isooncotic animals given ANP. These observations are consistent with the view that peritubular capillary hydraulic and oncotic pressures modulate the natriuretic and diuretic effects of ANP.\r"

In eight experiments using different batches of enzyme, the mean +/- SE rate of superoxide generation from 100 U of enzyme measured as the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c was 5.06 +/- 0.19 nmol/min in the first minute and 0.35 +/- 0.03 nmol/min subsequently. Optimum rates of superoxide were seen at concentrations of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide in excess of 80 microM and reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 3'-phosphate in excess of 100 microM. Using prostaglandin G2 or linoleic acid as substrate rather than arachidonate also resulted in superoxide generation. When prostaglandin H2 was used as substrate, no superoxide was generated. The rate of superoxide generation was markedly inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Superoxide generation was also observed during the action of lipoxygenase on either linoleic or arachidonic acid in the presence of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide or reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 3'-phosphate but not in their absence. Indomethacin had no effect on superoxide generation from lipoxygenase. We conclude that PGH synthase and lipoxygenase produce superoxide via a side-chain reaction dependent on the presence of suitable reducing cosubstrate. This mechanism is analogous to that described for peroxidases in general.\r"

The present studies were designed to examine the in vivo actions of ANP in acute angiotensin II-mediated hypertension. The cardiovascular, renal, and hormonal effects of intravenous ANP were evaluated in anesthetized normotensive (n = 6) and hypertensive (n = 6) dogs. In both groups, ANP (3.0 micrograms/kg bolus, 0.3 micrograms/kg/min continuous infusion) reduced arterial pressure and cardiac output without changing systemic vascular resistance. ANP specifically reduced renal vascular resistance and increased sodium excretion. The natriuresis observed was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive dogs. This occurred without a significant change in glomerular filtration rate or aldosterone. The ANP-mediated reduction in arterial pressure was associated with an increase in circulating arginine vasopressin and catecholamines but not in renin. These studies demonstrate that ANP-mediated hypotension results from a reduction in cardiac output without changing systemic vascular resistance, ANP acts as a specific renal vasodilator, ANP-mediated natriuresis can occur without alteration in glomerular filtration rate or aldosterone, and ANP specifically inhibits the release of renin without inhibiting the release of other circulating vasoconstrictors.\r"

  ".W": "Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol fails to stimulate prostaglandin synthesis in the isolated rabbit heart perfused with Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer. This lack of response could be due to reduced isoproterenol-stimulated liberation of arachidonic acid, reduced cyclooxygenase activity during Ca2+-free perfusion, or both. To test these hypotheses, we have examined the effect of isoproterenol and exogenous arachidonic acid on prostaglandin output in hearts perfused with Ca2+-containing and nominally Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit buffer. In hearts prelabelled with [3H]arachidonic acid and perfused with nominally Ca2+-free buffer, the release of radioactivity following isoproterenol was about 90% less than when Ca2+ was included in the perfusion buffer. When exogenous arachidonic acid was administered to hearts perfused with Ca2+-depleted buffer, the output of both 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 was about threefold greater than when Ca2+ was present in the perfusion medium. In the absence of Ca2+, the dose response curve for arachidonic acid-induced 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis underwent a parallel shift to the left, with no change in maximal synthesis levels, and a tenfold reduction in the ED50 of arachidonic acid. The cyclooxygenase activities of cell-free homogenates prepared from hearts perfused with and without Ca2+ were not different from each other and were both insensitive to added Ca2+. Reduction of the Na+ concentration of the perfusion medium to 35 mM resulted in increases in arachidonic acid-induced 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha less than those obtained during Ca2+-free perfusion, but greater than that observed during perfusion with normal Na+ (139 mM) and Ca2+ (2.5 mM). Arachidonic acid induced 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha output was inversely correlated with tissue Ca2+ but not Na+ content. These data suggest that in the absence of perfusate Ca2+, the availability of exogenous arachidonic acid to cyclooxygenase is increased, possibly by reduced incorporation into tissue phospholipids.\r"

Group comparison showed no significant differences of any cognitive measure. However, calculating an index of deterioration based on the discrepancy between current reading skills and current performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, five patients in the long-term group and two in the short-term group could be identified as functioning below their predicted premorbid optimum level. There was no correlation between cumulative exposure to water-born aluminum and any of the measures of cognitive function in either of the groups. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between the cumulative amount of aluminum prescribed to be taken orally and performance on cognitive tests in the long-term group. This observation strengthens the case for minimizing the prescription of aluminum-containing gut phosphate binders.\r"

The best results were obtained in patients with Mason Type 2 injuries treated by closed reduction without fracture excision and with early complete radial head excision for a Type 3 fracture. Late instability was not observed in any of the 24 patients. Prolonged immobilization (greater than four weeks) was associated with poor results. Ectopic ossification occurred in only one patient who had surgical treatment at eight days after injury; the grading score was only fair. These observations demonstrate that the injury should be treated with early reduction of the ulnohumeral joint and treatment of the radial head fracture according to its type. Immobilization for more than four weeks should be avoided. The prognosis is better than what has been thought previously.\r"

The plasma elimination rate constant for rt-PA was estimated to be 10.0 hr-1, the second-order catalytic rate constant for the in vivo rt-PA-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin 0.0078 (microgram rt-PA/kg body weight)-1 hr-1, the plasma elimination rate constant for plasmin 2.33 hr-1, and the second-order catalytic rate constant for the in vivo plasmin-catalyzed degradation of fibrinogen 0.466 (mg plasmin/dl)-1 hr-1. Computer simulation studies based on these parameter estimates show that the magnitude of fibrinogenolysis induced by rt-PA is related to the dose in a curvilinear fashion, showing diminishing increments in the effect at increasing doses. The degree of fibrinogenolysis induced by rt-PA administration is nearly independent of the dosing schedule.\r"

Although alpha-hANP infused into conscious rats at 0.67 microgram min-1 kg-1 markedly increased the urinary excretion of sodium and decreased mean arterial pressure, its infusion did not change PRC; however, it significantly lowered PAC. Frusemide infusion at 20.8 micrograms min-1 kg-1 induced natriuresis comparable with that of alpha-hANP and it elevated both PRC and PAC, but mean arterial pressure was not altered. Pretreatment of rats with captopril did not have any significant influence on the acute natriuretic and hypotensive effects of alpha-hANP. Although the inhibitory effect of ANP on the renin-aldosterone system may be involved in the chronic modulation of body fluid volume and blood pressure, this effect does not seem to be directly involved in the acute natriuretic and hypotensive effects of the peptide.\r"

Spontaneous pulses of growth hormone secretion on control days were unaccompanied by any increase in plasma ir-hGRF.

On the medium and high but not on the low salt diet the concentration increased significantly on adoption of the supine posture. Creatinine, sodium, lithium and fractional lithium clearances, fractional distal sodium excretion and total distal water and sodium reabsorption, which were estimated by the lithium clearance technique, were significantly higher on the high than on the low salt diet. The medium salt intake gave intermediate values. Heart rate while upright was significantly higher on the low than on either the medium or the high salt diets. Systolic blood pressure was unaffected by salt intake. Diastolic blood pressure in the supine position was significantly higher on the low than on the medium or high salt diets. Both plasma noradrenaline concentrations and plasma renin activity were significantly higher on the low than on the high salt diet. Values on the medium salt intake were intermediate. Plasma concentrations of both hormones were higher in the upright than in the supine posture on all three salt intakes.

Evidence that ANP acts physiologically requires the demonstration of a natriuretic effect when it is infused to recreate plasma concentrations similar to those observed after physiological stimuli. We infused human alpha-ANP (1-28) at a calculated rate of 1.2 pmol min-1 kg-1 for 3 h into seven water-loaded normal subjects, achieving plasma ANP concentrations within the upper part of the physiological range. The subjects' resting plasma ANP concentration increased from 3.8 +/- 1.5 to 20.9 +/- 1.9 pmol/l. The infusion of ANP caused a 60% increase of mean urinary sodium excretion from 111 +/- 18 to 182 +/- 30 mumol/min (P less than 0.001) and a 28% increase of mean water excretion from 10.8 +/- 0.8 to 13.8 +/- 1.6 ml/min (P less than 0.01).

  ".W": "Previously we have shown that sera from patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) will inhibit partially purified rat brain Na+, K+-ATPase and sodium efflux from human leucocytes in vitro. Similar inhibition may be involved in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy and cerebral oedema in these patients. In the present study we have attempted to establish whether the activity of brain Na+, K+-ATPase is decreased in vivo in rats with D-galactosamine induced hepatic failure using homogenates of snap-frozen brains. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was significantly reduced in the forebrain region at the stage of mild encephalopathy (43 h after injection), while at the deeper stage of coma (43-53 h after injection) enzyme activity was further reduced in the forebrain region and was also significantly reduced in the hindbrain region. Ouabain insensitive ATPase activity was not significantly altered at any time. While a significant increase in the water content (0.5%) of the hindbrain region was found 43 h after galactosamine, there was no clear correlation between the development of cerebral oedema and the reduction of Na+, K+-ATPase activity. The activity of partially purified normal rat brain Na+, K+-ATPase was 15% lower when incubated with sera from rats in the deep stage of coma compared with control sera. These data support other evidence that the reduction in brain Na+, K+-ATPase is likely to be due to toxic substance circulating in serum which have been shown to inhibit this enzyme in vitro and to cause coma when administered to normal animals.\r"

  ".W": "Ventilation was initiated and maintained by high-frequency oscillation (HFO) in nine immature lambs not expected to survive for more than a few minutes out of the uterus. They were delivered to HFO (18 to 20 Hz) and ventilated only with air at the setting that yielded optimal blood gases and pH. Once removed from HFO, cardiorespiratory arrest occurred within minutes despite the return of previously inhibited natural inspiratory efforts. At autopsy, the lungs were liquid-filled (i.e., fetal). Thus, HFO had maintained viability without promoting either lung stability or fetal pulmonary fluid (FPF) absorption. Additional experiments on excised immature lungs showed that aeration is determined by distending pressure, which is regulated by the flow through the oscillator circuit and monitored most accurately as transpulmonary pressure (TPP). Once air-entry has begun, alveolar recruitment and negative compliance establish the limits of tolerable lung expansion via TPP. Within these limits, the immature lung can be ventilated effectively with air. However, since these lungs do not produce intrapulmonary foam, lung stability and FPF absorption are not effected. Complications of HFO (including pneumothorax, decreased arterial pressure and heart rate, and metabolic acidemia) can be related to overdistention of the lungs.\r"

We devised a computer program to simulate our 12-bed medical/cardiac ICU workload and staffing system. Nursing staffing policies, costs, and availabilities, and a table of past patient acuities per shift were input; total overstaffing, understaffing, and cost per year for full-time nursing equivalents (FTEs) for direct patient care were output for different staffing levels. Using the model, we considered financial concerns, quality of care issues, and staff working preferences and determined that our best staffing level would be based on 5.5 direct FTEs per shift. The stimulation analysis is straightforward, flexible, adaptable, and easy to update and use.\r"

In general, MICU patients had more physiologic derangement, as determined by the admission, maximal, and average acute physiology scores (APS). SICU patients had more frequent therapeutic interventions as measured by admission, maximal, and average therapeutic intervention scoring system values. Notably, 40% of MICU and 30% of SICU patients never received any active interventions and were admitted strictly for monitoring purposes. Patients on admission with APS less than or equal to 10 had markedly shorter ICU stays, with almost 50% less treatment than patients with APS over 10. Fifty-six percent of patients with APS less than or equal to 10 did not require any active intervention. In contrast, 83% of patients with APS greater than 10 had considerable intensive interventions. These patients required mechanical ventilation, invasive monitoring, and vasoactive drugs more than twice as often as patients with lower APS scores. Consideration should be given, therefore, to the organization of ICUs according to the patient's severity of illness.\r"

  ".W": "Much concern has been expressed about the Medicare Prospective Payment System's impact on access to care. In this study, we examine the financial impact of diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment for chronic ventilator-dependent Medicare patients. During a one-year period, payment for 95 Medicare patients who received a minimum of three days of continuous ventilator treatment and who spent no time in surgical intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, was calculated to be $2.2 million below costs, representing an average loss per discharge of $23,129. Patients stayed an average of 26.6 days, of which 14.2 days were spent on a ventilator. We conclude that the results suggest a financial bias against chronic ventilator-dependent patients exists in the DRG system which could present access problems. We recommend three approaches to recognizing the cost of care for such patients in the DRG payment system and encourage those in public policy-making positions to use our results as the basis for a larger scale analysis of the impact of Medicare DRG payment on chronic ventilator-dependent patients.\r"

A significant difference (p less than 0.05) was found between Medicare patients vs non-Medicare patients for age (71 +/- 7 vs 51 +/- 9 years) and mortality (13 percent vs 6 percent). No significant difference was found for admissions to the intensive care unit (95 percent vs 95 percent), mean length of stay in intensive care (4.7 +/- 5.3 vs 3.9 +/- 5.4 days), mean length of hospitalization (9.6 +/- 7.5 vs 7.9 +/- 7.0 days), mean number of International Classification Diagnoses (ICD-9) surgical operations (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 0.6 +/- 1.2), and mean number of ICD procedures (3.0 +/- 2.3 vs 3.3 +/- 2.1). The average cost of care ($13,427 +/- $12,700 per patient) for Medicare patients was higher but not statistically different from non-Medicare patients ($10,474 +/- $10,114 per patient). Prior cost-based Medicare payments ($10,594 +/- $9,861 per patient) have been significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced by 24 percent under the Medicare diagnosis-related group (DRG) prospective payment system ($8,024 +/- $4,824). The DRG payments are significantly less than (p less than 0.001) and provide only 60 percent of the true hospital cost required to care for Medicare cardiac patients referred for tertiary care ($13,427 +/- $12,700 per patient). A Medicare DRG system adopted by third-party payers would reduce present hospital revenues from $9,524 +/- $8,422 per patient to $7,968 +/- $4,800 per patient and would provide only 68 percent of the cost required in the care of all cardiac patients referred for tertiary care ($11,690 +/- $11,344). The results of this study indicate that hospitals that receive large numbers of seriously ill cardiac patients, especially Medicare patients, referred for critical care are at a significant financial disadvantage under the Medicare DRG system. Future economic pressures may prohibit critical care treatment centers from accepting large numbers of cardiac patients referred for intensive care and reimbursed under the current Medicare DRG payment policy.\r"

Studies were conducted both before and after the administration of intravenous atropine. Resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure was 8 mm Hg (3-19 mm Hg). In response to inflation of the peritoneal cavity with carbon dioxide gas, lower esophageal sphincter pressure rose significantly more than intraabdominal pressure whether the stomach was empty or full. In three of the six pigs, phasic lower esophageal sphincter pressure variations occurred as intraabdominal pressure increased. These variations were unrelated to respiration. Resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure was little affected by 75 micrograms/kg intravenous atropine which also had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter response to increasing intraabdominal pressure. We conclude that, in the pig, the lower esophageal sphincter pressure increases more than the intraabdominal pressure in response to challenge and that excitatory cholinergic fibers do not mediate this response.\r"

Few studies comparing mupirocin to other topical antibiotics are available. Initial studies comparing mupirocin to inactive vehicle in the treatment of impetigo indicate an overall 92 percent pathogen eradication rate with active drug and 58 percent eradication rate with vehicle. Overall response to treatment of secondary skin infections was favorable in 91 percent of patients treated with mupirocin and 77 percent of those treated with vehicle. Although incidence is not greater than placebo, adverse effects have included pruritus, burning, dry skin, and erythema. Additional trials and clinical use should further help determine the role of mupirocin in the treatment of minor, primary, and secondary skin infections.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular and clinical pharmacology of cromolyn sodium are reviewed. Cromolyn sodium inhibits the release of mediators of inflammation, induced by specific antigens as well as nonspecific mechanisms, such as exercise, from mast cells. Cromolyn may also inhibit the activity of other cell types that produce inflammation. It is the only antiasthmatic that blocks both early and late asthmatic responses induced by allergen inhalation and exercise. Consequently, cromolyn therapy can block the increase in bronchial hyperreactivity induced by chronic allergen exposure. Cromolyn is effective for controlling the symptoms of mild to moderate chronic asthma in 60 to 70 percent of patients. In comparative studies, cromolyn has been as effective as theophylline for controlling symptoms of chronic asthma with fewer side effects, and may be particularly suited for asthmatic patients with learning or behavioral problems. The combination of theophylline and cromolyn is often more effective than either agent alone. Because of the convenience of administration, cromolyn is preferred over theophylline for exercise-induced asthma. Cromolyn may allow the corticosteroid dosage to be reduced in severe steroid-dependent asthmatics, but it is primarily indicated for the prophylaxis of mild to moderate disease. Adverse reactions to cromolyn are uncommon to rare. Cromolyn is now available in a Spinhaler, a metered-dose aerosol, and a nebulizer solution. If taken properly all preparations appear to be equally effective. Attention to proper inhalation technique and appropriate education of the patient is essential to ensure a good outcome with cromolyn.\r"

Today, health-care practitioners and health-care providers are seeking services not sought before from pharmacists in the area of rational therapeutics. This need for information extends to all pharmacy practice settings: institutional, independent pharmacies, chain stores, governmental agencies, and the pharmaceutical industry. In order to meet this demand for drug and toxicology information, however, the pharmacist must use resources outside the immediate area of his practice. The Drug Information Center (DIC) can be used as such a resource by pharmacists in their daily practice to provide the best possible care with regard to the rational use of drugs for their patients/clients. Specifically, our data indicate that in Tennessee, there is a need for providing drug and toxicology information; pharmacists perceive their role to be providers of drug information as well as drugs; the DIC plays an integral and necessary role as a back-up information resource and in teaching, service, research, and continuing education programs; and the programs provided by the DIC are cost effective and cost justifiable.\r"

On one of the remaining 2 test days, morning medication was delayed until after testing (low concentration condition), whereas sodium valproate was given before testing on the alternate session (high concentration day). The data were analyzed for the effects of diagnosis (partial vs. generalized epilepsy), dose (above or below 20 mg/kg/day), and time of medication (low and high drug concentration days). Four variables discriminated between the diagnostic groups, all favoring children with generalized epilepsy. Another four measures were significantly associated with dose, with those on lower doses performing at a superior level. Time of medication had virtually no effect on performance, however. The findings were related to previous diagnostic and dosage research. Although a deterioration in performance at higher doses appears to be consistent with other dosage research, the absence of an effect due to time of medication suggests that performance does not fluctuate between drug administrations.\r"

The administration of VPA (500 mg/kg/day)-plus-PB (20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, however, did not induce megamitochondrial formation, but in these livers an unusual increase was observed in the number of liver mitochondria, microvesicular steatoses, and myeloid bodies. VPA-treated rats had significantly lower levels of serum-free and total carnitine and higher levels of acylcarnitine and acyl to free ratio than those of the controls. The free carnitine concentrations in serum and liver of the rats treated with VPA-plus-PB were much lower as compared with those treated with either VPA or PB. These morphological and biochemical results, especially of carnitine metabolism, suggest that inhibition of beta-oxidation in liver mitochondria occurred in rats treated with VPA and PB and that, in particular, polytherapy with VPA-plus-PB could be clinically hazardous in causing hepatic injury.\r"

The treatments did not affect the levels of phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, ADP, and AMP, but did enhance the glycogen or glucose stores. Pentobarbital induced a decrease in lactate, whereas valproate led to a decrease in pyruvate and an increase in lactate. Calculation of the metabolite fluxes after decapitation showed that all treatments delayed the rate of ATP utilization. The response was dose-dependent except with valproate. In addition, pentobarbital led to reductions in glucose utilization and lactate production, but the other drugs had no significant effect on glycolysis rate. The sparing effect on ATP utilization may be related to a membrane-stabilizing effect and may provide brain protection in case of excessive neuronal activation.\r"

Seizures induced a significant elevation of arterial blood pressure and profound changes in the blood gases and in the acid-base balance, with a marked reduction in brain tissue pH. Despite an intense brain acidosis, however, and a significant rise in blood/brain [H+] gradient, phenobarbital brain concentrations were not reduced during seizures but, on the contrary, were increased in 7 of 11 piglets. These data suggest that contrary to the pH partition hypothesis, brain uptake of PB is concomitantly increased during seizures and brain acidosis.\r"

Blood samples were obtained for baseline determinations and daily thereafter, 24 hours after the injection of hMG. Serum estradiol (E2), progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Bioassayable LH (LH-b) was determined by the immature mice interstitial cell in vitro bioassay for testosterone with LER-907 as the reference standard. Appropriate follicular growth, assessed by pelvic ultrasonography, occurred in all cycles. During induction days mean immunoassayable LH (LH-i) and LH-b levels were suppressed until the E2 concentrations rose to a mean of 1420.5 +/- 149 pg/ml (standard error of the mean), at which time a concurrent rise in LH-b and LH-i levels was observed (130% and 34%, respectively). LH-b/LH-i ratio increased by 63% on the day E2 peaked, indicating enhanced LH bioactivity before hCG administration. Our data suggest that during hMG/hCG-induced cycles, in a high E2 milieu, endogenous or exogenous LH may show a heterogeneity in its molecular content, resulting in enhanced bioactivity relative to immunoactivity.\r"

The purpose of this study was to assess the adrenal contribution to the hyperandrogenic state in these women. Twenty-three patients presenting with the combination of hyperinsulinemia, elevated testosterone (T) levels, and acanthosis nigricans were investigated for the source of the increased androgen production. Twelve patients had elevated serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DS) levels (high DS group) suggestive of increased adrenal androgen production. Eleven patients had normal DS levels (normal DS group). Both normal DS and high DS groups had similar basal serum insulin levels and similar insulin response curves after a 3-hour, 75-gm, oral glucose tolerance test. No correlation was found between serum T or DS levels and either basal serum insulin levels or the area under the insulin response curve. These data suggest that DS levels are frequently elevated in patients with hirsutism, acanthosis, and hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, the lack of association between serum DS and serum insulin levels suggests that insulin does not directly affect adrenal androgen production, or vice versa.\r"

We evaluated hormone levels in 20 follicular fluids that were associated with mature oocytes that have fertilized abnormally (greater than or equal to pronuclei) and compared them to follicles with mature oocytes that cleaved normally, fertilized but failed to cleave, or did not fertilize. Progesterone (P), androstenedione, estradiol, percent free estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, insulin, and prolactin were measured. P levels were significantly higher in follicular fluids associated with oocytes that fertilized abnormally than in the other groups. Levels of the other hormones were similar in all the study groups. We conclude that IVF of oocytes from highly luteinized follicles as judged by P levels may result in polypronuclear fertilization.\r"

On the contrary in a large number of patients affected by azoospermia because of seminiferous tubular damage (750.4 +/- 83.6 nmol/ejaculate; 6.8 +/- 0.9 U/ejaculate; and 6.1 +/- 0.6 mumol/ejaculate; respectively) and in a few oligozoospermic subjects (1193.7 +/- 72.3 nmol/ejaculate; 10.3 +/- 0.7 U/ejaculate; and 10.8 +/- 0.7 mumol/ejaculate; respectively) the epididymal indices were found in the range of vasectomized subjects, showing an association between seminiferous tubular lesion and epididymal dysfunction. In conclusion, in spite of the low levels of epididymal indices found in patients with obstructive azoospermia, the presence of a large number of subjects with seminiferous tubular lesions without obstruction with similar low values of L-carnitine, alpha-glucosidase, and glycerylphosphorylcholine reduces the usefulness of these indices in differential diagnosis of azoospermia.\r"

Because CC augments ovarian aromatase activity, the effect of CC on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor content was examined in primary cultures of rat granulosa cells. Control cultures contained low LH receptor content, whereas FSH stimulated LH receptor formation in a dose-dependent manner. The concomitant addition of CC enhanced FSH potency as shown by a decrease in the ED50 for FSH by 2.2-fold. Some cells were treated with a low concentration of FSH (12 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of CC (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M). The enhancement of FSH-stimulated LH receptor formation was found to be CC dose dependent, with an ED50 of 6 X 10(-8) M. Thus, CC may play a direct ovarian role in the enhancement of FSH-stimulated LH receptors. The gonadal action of this compound may be relevant in understanding the efficacy of CC in ovulation induction.\r"

We studied 170 IVF cycles in 142 patients and retrospectively compared ultrasound and endocrine parameters in pregnancy cycles and spontaneous LH surge cycles with nonpregnancy, non-LH surge cycles. Twenty-six of the 170 cycles resulted in a pregnancy (15.2%). Oocytes were recovered from 27 of 31 cycles in which a spontaneous LH surge occurred, and 9 of these cycles produced a pregnancy (33%). Follicle number and serum E2 on the day of ultrasound (cycle day 12 or 13) was lower in the LH surge group and pregnancy group than in the nonpregnant, non-LH surge group. In contrast, on the day of hCG administration or LH surge, serum E2 concentration per follicle greater than 1 cm in diameter was higher in the combined LH surge/pregnancy group (1219 pmol/l) than in the nonpregnancy/non-LH surge group (932 pmol/l). Our data suggest that it may be possible to individualize hCG administration at midcycle by determining the number of follicles greater than 1 cm by ultrasound on cycle day 12 or 13 and giving hCG when serum E2 levels reach 1100 to 1200 pmol/l per follicle.\r"

Rates of total glucose utilization, glucose oxidation, nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD), glucose metabolic clearance rate (MCR), and endogenous glucose production (EGP) were determined with a \"two-level\" insulin-clamp technique (100-min infusions at 40 and 400 mU X m-2 X min-1) combined with indirect calorimetry and D-3-[3H]glucose infusion. Muscle biopsy specimens from vastus lateralis were analyzed for glycogen content and glycogen synthase activity before and after insulin infusions. After exercise, NIDDM subjects had muscle glycogen concentrations comparable with those of lean and obese subjects. The activation of glycogen synthase both by prior exercise and insulin infusion was similar to lean controls. After exercise, total glucose disposal was significantly increased during the 40-mU X m-2 X min-1 infusion (P less than .05), but the increase observed during the 400-mU X m-2 X min-1 infusion was not significant. These increases after exercise were the result of significantly higher NOGD during both levels of insulin infusion. The MCR of glucose during both insulin infusions was reduced in NIDDM compared with lean subjects but was very similar to that in obese nondiabetics. Basal EGP was significantly reduced on the morning after exercise (4.03 +/- 0.27 vs. 3.21 +/- 0.21 mg x kg-1 fat-free mass x min-1) (P less than .05) and associated with significant reductions of fasting plasma glucose (197 +/- 12 vs. 164 +/- 9 mg/dl).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three-week-old rats were weaned onto semisynthetic diets containing either 5% protein (low protein; LP) or 15% protein (control; C) and maintained for 3 wk on their respective diets. At 6 wk of age all rats were returned to a commercial rat chow diet (18% protein). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretory response to glucose, and the protein/DNA ratio in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, small intestine, and lung were investigated at 3, 6, and 12 wk of age. Rats receiving LP diet failed to gain weight, but growth resumed immediately when they were transferred to commercial rat chow. They did not, however, catch up with C rats. Glucose tolerance and insulin secretory response to glucose remained similar between 3 and 12 wk in C rats. In 6-wk-old LP rats, glucose tolerance was impaired, and the insulin secretory response to glucose was absent. At 12 wk of age the glucose tolerance of the LP rats had normalized, but the insulin secretory response was still blunted. In 6-wk-old LP rats there was an inhibition of the age-dependent increase in cell size, shown by lowered protein/DNA ratios in all tissues studied. This decrease in cell size persisted at 12 wk in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and lung. We conclude that protein-calorie malnutrition early in life persistently impairs the insulin secretion. The persistently lowered protein/DNA ratios in many tissues may be related to this lowered capacity for insulin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, is used in the treatment of NIDDM because of its hypoglycemic action. However, the site and mechanism of action of this sulfonylurea remain unclear. We examined the ability of glyburide to enhance insulin's inhibitory effect on glucagon-stimulated hepatic glucose production. The livers of fed male rats were perfused with a Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing washed human red blood cells. After a 60-min control period during which the liver was exposed to both insulin and glucagon (10 microU/ml and 11 pg/ml, respectively), the glucagon concentration was increased to 88 pg/ml in the presence of 0, 10, 40, and 240 microU/ml of insulin. Hepatic glucose output and phosphorylase a activity were monitored during the control and elevated-glucagon periods. The glyburide-infused group received glyburide (1.6 microgram/ml) during both the control and elevated-glucagon periods. As expected, high levels of insulin suppressed glucagon-stimulated glucose production and phosphorylase activation. Insulin at a concentration of 10 microU/ml was unable to suppress glucagon's stimulation of glucose production or its activation of phosphorylase. However, in the presence of glyburide it was able to decrease stimulated hepatic glucose production and phosphorylase activation by 40 and 50% respectively. In the absence of insulin, glyburide was unable to suppress glucagon's glycogenolytic action, suggesting that the drug potentiates insulin's action on the liver rather than exerting an inhibitory effect directly. Insulin at a concentration of 240 microU/ml completely suppressed glucagon action, and glyburide had no additional effect. Therefore, glyburide is able to enhance the sensitivity of the perfused rat liver to insulin without altering maximal insulin responsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of 4 wk of streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on the transmission time of the auditory-evoked brain stem response (ABR) was examined in conscious male Sprague-Dawley rats. Distal nerve transmission time of the auditory pathway (latency of peak II), which includes conduction along the 8th cranial nerve, increased in diabetic rats (n = 9) relative to nondiabetic rats (n = 17). The difference in peak II latency between diabetic and control rats was significant beginning 2 wk after the induction of diabetes (P less than .05). In contrast, 4 wk of STZ-induced diabetes had no effect on the central transmission time of the auditory pathway (interpeak latency between peaks II and IV). Oral administration of tolrestat, a structurally novel aldose reductase inhibitor (n = 8; 20 mg/kg twice daily 1 wk before and 4 wk after STZ injection), prevented the diabetes-induced increase in distal nerve transmission time. These findings indicate that experimentally induced diabetes can result in a nerve dysfunction as measured by the increased latencies of the early components of the ABR. Furthermore, because tolrestat prevents these changes in the ABR, aldose reductase and the polyol pathway are implicated in this neuropathy.\r"

The cellular requirements for this graft damage are unclear. This study was designed to investigate the role of the L3T4+ T-lymphocyte subset in disease recurrence in the NOD mouse. L3T4+ T-lymphocytes were depleted by the in vivo administration of the L3T4-specific monoclonal antibody GK1.5. This treatment reduced the level of L3T4+ T-lymphocytes from an initial 43% of the peripheral blood lymphocytes to less than 4%. L3T4 levels remained at this low level for approximately 2 wk after withdrawal of GK1.5 treatment, after which the L3T4 levels slowly began to increase in the periphery. Grafting of cultured BALB/c islet tissue into GK1.5-treated diabetic NOD mice resulted in a rapid return to normoglycemia that persisted for 2-4 wk. The gradual return to the hyperglycemic condition roughly correlated with the reappearance of L3T4+ T-lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation. From these findings we conclude that the disease process in the NOD mouse is L3T4 T-lymphocyte dependent.\r"

Four of 10 patients on misoprostol and 3 of 8 patients on placebo developed gastroduodenal mucosal injury (p greater than 0.1), which was confirmed by endoscopy. Significant tumor responses to chemotherapy were equally distributed between the two groups. Although our sample size was small and type II error (false-negative trial) cannot be excluded, these data strongly suggest that prophylaxis with misoprostol does not prevent the acute gastroduodenal mucosal injury associated with hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agents.\r"

One species, Saguinus oedipus oedipus, has the additional feature of developing adenocarcinoma of the colon in this setting. Pathological and lectin histochemistry studies were undertaken in 50 such colonic specimens to determine if pathological or histochemical features were associated with the concomitant development of cancer. Chronic inflammation was found in all of the colons examined, and 14% had features of acute inflammation, which was significantly associated with those animals that developed cancer. An oncofetal glycoconjugate structure has been defined in human colons by the ability to bind peanut lectin. A similar glycoconjugate, probably a mucin, was expressed in the colons of 65% of these animals. A marked degree of expression of the mucin was significantly associated with those animals that developed cancer. A highly significant association was found between the presence of acute inflammation and the expression of the mucin. These studies demonstrate similarities in glycoconjugate expression between the human colon and the New World monkey model of spontaneous colitis. A form of mucin is expressed in these animals that is highly associated with both the presence of acute inflammation and the development of cancer elsewhere in the colon. In addition, an association between acute inflammatory activity and neoplasia was found, suggesting a potential etiologic linkage between the two.\r"

The model uses indirect evidence about such factors as cancer incidence, sensitivity and specificity of different tests, and treatment effectiveness. The analysis indicates that for screening people over 40 yr old an annual fecal occult blood test may reduce colorectal cancer mortality by about one-third, either colonoscopy or barium enema may reduce mortality by approximately 85%, a 3-5-yr frequency for endoscopies or barium enemas preserves 70%-90% of the effectiveness of an annual frequency, and beginning screening at age 50 reduces effectiveness by 5%-10%. Although both barium enemas and colonoscopies appear to be effective in reducing mortality, the lower cost of the barium enema makes it a more cost-effective strategy. All of these estimates depend on the baseline estimates of each of the factors incorporated in the model; the conclusions are most sensitive to assumptions about the natural history of adenomatous polyps, the bleeding of adenomas and presymptomatic cancers, and the sensitivity of the fecal occult blood test. Recommendations about colorectal cancer screening must also consider factors such as discomfort, inconvenience, and the availability of various technologies.\r"

The total atrial ANF content (microgram/atrium) in one-kidney, one clip (1K1C) rats was lower during Weeks 1 and 2, but only in the left atrium. Lower ANF concentrations (microgram/mg protein) were also evident in the left atrium at Weeks 1, 2, and 8, and in the right atrium at Week 8. A negative correlation between ANF in plasma and in the left atrium was discerned (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01). Blood pressure (184 +/- 4 vs 114 +/- 4 mm Hg), body weight, and plasma ANF were also examined in 1K1C rats and their normotensive controls before and after unclipping. Blood pressure was normalized 6 hours after unclipping. Plasma ANF declined in 1K1C rats within 6 hours after clip removal, but it was still higher than in the controls. Plasma ANF was similar in both groups on Days 9 and 13 after unclipping. There were no differences in atrial ANF between hypertensive and normotensive animals 13 days after unclipping. The high levels of plasma ANF observed in 1K1C rats probably are secondary to increased intra-atrial pressure caused by the dual mechanism of expanded plasma volume and high blood pressure.\r"

CBA Agouti mice were made hypertensive by exposure to social stress in a complex population cage. After 2 months, the hindquarter vascular bed was pump-perfused at a constant flow with plasma substitute to evaluate changes in perfusion pressure, and helical strips of aorta were suspended in muscle baths for measurement of isometric force generation. Tissues were treated with methoxamine to induce contractile tone. Threshold dilator responses to acetylcholine were elicited at a significantly lower dose in the hindquarters of hypertensive mice than in those from normotensive mice, indicating increased vasodilator sensitivity. In contrast, vasodilator responsiveness to nitroprusside in hindquarters of hypertensive mice did not differ from that in hindquarters of normotensive mice. Aortas from hypertensive mice were more sensitive (lower ED50) to the relaxant effects of acetylcholine and A23187 than those from normotensive mice. The relaxant effects of nitroprusside and 8-bromo cGMP on aortas from hypertensive mice were not significantly different from those in normotensive aortas. Aortic strips that had been rubbed on the lumen surface with a wooden stick did not relax to acetylcholine or A23187. In aortas that were not initially contracted with methoxamine, acetylcholine and A23187 caused small contractions from baseline. The magnitude of these contractile responses were potentiated after removal of the endothelium, and the potentiation was greater in aortas from hypertensive mice. These results demonstrate an increased responsiveness to endothelium-dependent vasodilators in this psychosocial model of hypertension.\r"

Columns (0.2 ml) packed with microcarriers were perfused with oxygenated (20% O2) Tyrode's solution containing indomethacin (10 microM), and the effluent was passed through precontracted, endothelium-denuded detector arteries. When the endothelial cells were stimulated with bradykinin (3-100 nM), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (0.3-30 microM), or calcium ionophore A23187 (10-300 nM), they released dose-dependently a nonprostanoid compound that dilated the detector vessel. The factor, probably identical to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor of native endothelium, evoked dilations of the same magnitude in different types of detector vessels (rabbit thoracic aorta, rabbit femoral artery, canine coronary artery). However, this relaxant factor was significantly more effective in arteries precontracted by norepinephrine or serotonin than in arteries precontracted by potassium depolarization. Thus, its dilator action resembles that of the nitrovasodilators. The factor is labile, with an apparent half-life in the range of 20 to 30 seconds. Its dilator potency was inhibited by dithiothreitol (0.2 mM), metyrapone (0.2 mM), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (20 microM), and hemoglobin (1 microM), all of which apparently inactivated the factor. Synthesis or release (or both) of the relaxant factor was abolished by methylene blue (1 microM). High PO2 levels (greater than 400 mm Hg) in the perfusate markedly reduced the release of the relaxant factor from the cultured cells. This study demonstrates that a vascular relaxant factor is released from endothelial cells in monoculture by adenosine 5'-triphosphate, bradykinin, and A23187 and establishes such a culture as a useful tool for analyzing the mechanisms of endothelium-dependent vasomotion.\r"

In the present study we evaluated longitudinal changes in blood pressure in DS in which cataracts eventually developed and those in which cataracts did not develop when all animals were maintained on a high sodium diet. Lenses were evaluated by slit-lamp microscopy to determine if cataractous lesions were similar among rats, to classify lesion types, and to define the age at which cataracts were detectable in DS. The possible participation of several cataractogenic risk factors as major influences on cataract formation also was evaluated. Finally, aqueous humor concentrations and lenticular content of sodium and potassium were determined to evaluate the possibility that a defect in ion transport at the lens epithelium and ciliary body might play a role in cataractogenesis in DS, since ion transport defects have been shown to lead to lens opacification in other models of genetic and experimental cataracts. Parallel studies were performed in Dahl salt-resistant control rats (DR). A high incidence of cataract formation was found in DS. Although systolic blood pressure was not consistently greater in adult DS with cataracts compared with values in age-matched DS without cataracts, the initial pressor response to a high salt diet was greatest in weanling DS in which cataractous lesions later developed. Slit-lamp analysis revealed that cataracts in this genetic model were cortical, with one mixed cortical, nuclear lesion. Posterior subcapsular lesions were not observed, suggesting that lesions were not steroid-induced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We treated a patient with these fractures whose deformed steel-reinforced work boot indicated that the mechanism of injury had been external rotation, dorsiflexion, and abduction. We found this fracture pattern in eleven other patients. We concluded that the malleolar fracture is an oblique avulsion injury and that impingement of the talus on the anterolateral aspect of the tibial plafond accounts for the other fracture. The identification of an oblique medial malleolar fracture should prompt a search for a fracture of the anterolateral aspect of the tibial plafond; the reverse is also true.\r"

All their symptoms were relieved by excision of the ossicle with reconstitution of the fibular collateral ligament. Whilst a separate secondary centre of ossification at the lower fibula is present in 1% of healthy children between the ages of 6 and 12 years, the condition described is extremely uncommon.

We have investigated the presence of GnRH-binding sites in ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231, Sk Br 3, MDA-MB-157, and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines and the effect of GnRH analogs on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine and 14C-labeled amino acids into DNA and protein. Specific GnRH-binding sites were present in membrane preparations of all five human breast carcinoma cell lines. Studies in three cell lines indicated low affinity (Kd, 1.6-3.0 X 10(-6) M) GnRH binding similar to that reported in human placenta and corpus luteum. In contrast, human pituitary GnRH receptors were of high affinity (Kd, 4.8 X 10(-9) M). Breast carcinoma cell GnRH-binding sites also differed from the pituitary receptor in their inability to discriminate between GnRH and superactive analogs. Binding of a [125I]GnRH analog to ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells and pituitary membranes was affected similarly by various cations. GnRH antagonists rapidly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (within 3 hr), and this effect was reversible. GnRH antagonists also inhibited cell growth, but only after 6 days. GnRH agonists did not alter either thymidine incorporation or growth. The present observations of low affinity GnRH-binding sites in breast cancer cell lines and inhibitory effects of GnRH antagonists point to the possibility of an autocrine regulatory role of GnRH-like peptides in mammary cells.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in the same patients treated with oral bromocriptine (Brc). A single dose of 50 micrograms SMS administered to 28 patients induced a more rapid, greater, and more prolonged reduction in plasma GH levels than did 2.5 mg Brc. Chronic treatment [60-330 days; mean 208 +/- 23 (+/- SEM)] with SMS (100-300 micrograms/day) induced in 16 patients a significantly greater decrease in mean plasma GH and somatomedin-C levels than did 20 mg Brc. Combined treatment with the 2 agents had an additional effect. The clinical and metabolic parameters of acromegaly dramatically improved in all patients whose plasma GH and somatomedin-C levels decreased even if they were not normalized by SMS. Reduction in tumor size occurred in 3 of the 10 patients examined by computed tomography before and during SMS treatment. We conclude that SMS is more effective than Brc and that the 2 drugs may be complementary in the medical treatment of acromegaly.\r"

Five performance criteria for evaluating the eligibility of TSH assays for these new roles are proposed. Criterion 1 requires a less than 1% overlap between the variation of the lower normal value and the assay detection limit. Criteria 2 and 3 require subnormal basal TSH values in 95% of patients with subnormal TRH response, and detectable basal TSH values in 95% of patients with normal TRH responses. Criteria 4 and 5 require undetectable TSH values in 95% of hyperthyroid patients and detectable TSH values in 95% of clinically euthyroid subjects. Evaluation of 20 published studies using commercial reagents showed that only 5 assays met criterion 1; most reports did not provide adequate information for evaluation. We evaluated 2 sensitive assays by assessment of sera from 149 normal subjects and 893 patients. Substantial differences were found; only assay B met all performance criteria. With assay B, serum TSH levels were normal in 86%, increased in 7%, undetectable in 4%, and subnormal in 3% of 454 patients undergoing a screening T4 measurement. Sensitive TSH assays fulfilling our criteria may be useful as front-line thyroid function tests.\r"

  ".W": "A sensitive and specific in vitro granulosa cell aromatase bioassay was adapted to measure bioactive FSH (bio-FSH) levels in urine samples. Urinary levels of bio-FSH, immunoreactive LH, estrone conjugates, and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PdG) were measured in first morning urine samples during the menstrual cycle in six cycling women and four lowland gorillas. The cycle length of women was relatively constant [28 +/- 1 (+/- SD) days], but varied from 28-38 days for lowland gorillas; the length of the luteal phases was relatively constant for both. All subjects had a midcycle LH peak and a luteal phase elevation in PdG. In addition, urinary estrogen excretion displayed a midcycle elevation that preceded the LH peak and a luteal phase increase similar to that of PdG. The bio-FSH levels in urine of cycling women, although at almost 100-fold higher concentrations, exhibited a pattern that closely resembled that of serum bio-FSH levels reported earlier, with an early follicular phase rise and a midcycle peak. Statistical analysis indicated a highly significant correlation (r = 0.90) between serum and urinary bio-FSH levels during the human menstrual cycle and in women in several hypo- and hypergonadotropic states, including oral contraceptive pill users, hypothalamic amenorrhea, premature ovarian failure, and postmenopause. Although a midcycle bio-FSH surge was also detected in lowland gorillas, two peaks of bio-FSH levels were consistently found during the follicular phase. The late follicular phase increase in bio-FSH levels was presumably involved in follicle selection and preceded the midcycle FSH peak by about 6 days, whereas the timing of the early follicular phase peak was variable, suggesting the involvement of complex regulatory mechanisms. These findings suggest that measurement of urinary bio-FSH levels in humans reflects serum bio-FSH in subjects in several physiological and pathological states. Studies of urinary bio-FSH levels in humans and nonhuman primates are useful in monitoring menstrual cycles, and the gorillas may be a model for understanding human reproductive cycles. The urinary granulosa cell aromatase bioassay should be useful for future assessment of bio-FSH levels in situations where serum measurements are impractical or in animal species for which specific FSH RIAs are not available.\r"

The women were allocated to 4 groups: women with cycles whose plasma FSH level was less than 40 mIU/mL (A; n = 16), women with cycles whose plasma FSH level was greater than 40 mIU/mL (B; n = 19), women who were amenorrheic for less than 1 yr (C; n = 13), and women who were amenorrheic for more than 1 yr (D; n = 30). The mean plasma SHBG values were 51.4 +/- 5.7 (+/- SE), 48.3 +/- 4.3, 45.9 +/- 5.4, and 51.1 +/- 3.7 nM in groups 1-4 respectively, and were not significantly different from one another. The mean % free E2 and % free T values also were not different between the groups. However, the mean total E2 and free E2 (% free E2 X E2/100) concentrations were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher in both groups A and B than in groups C and D. The E2 concentration was also higher in group A than in group B. There were strong correlations between the E2 and free E2 concentrations between the T and free T (% free T X T/100); (P less than 0.0001) concentrations, between SHBG capacity and weight, and between the MCRs of both E2 and T and % free E2 and % free T. In normal women, the menopause is not associated with changes in SHBG or % free steroids. Hence, the measurement of E2 could be used to predict the mass of free E2 in these women.\r"

  ".W": "The characteristics and dynamics of hormone secretion in vivo and in vitro were investigated in six patients with gonadotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas. All six tumors secreted and contained FSH and different combinations of LH, beta-LH, and alpha-subunit. In addition, immunohistochemical examination of the pituitary tumor tissue showed staining with both LH and FSH in three and either LH or FSH in the other three tumors. TRH and GnRH stimulated hormone secretion in vivo and in vitro, and they also increased the hormone content of the cultured tumor cells. Bromocriptine significantly inhibited hormone release and reduced the hormone content of the tumor cells. In vivo, 2.5 mg bromocriptine significantly suppressed plasma hormone levels; the inhibiting effect on alpha-subunit concentrations was in general more marked than that on LH and FSH. We conclude that hormone release by gonadotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas can be stimulated by TRH and GnRH and inhibited by bromocriptine. Most of these tumors synthesize FSH, but there is a wide variation in the production of LH, beta-LH, and alpha-subunits. The sensitivity of hormone release to bromocriptine suggests that chronic therapy with this drug might have a beneficial effect on pituitary tumor size.\r"

Since gonadotropin production by pituitary adenomas may reflect imbalanced glycoprotein biosynthesis, we studied tumor LH and subunit biosynthesis and secretion in a patient with a LH- and alpha-subunit-producing pituitary tumor. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the tumor revealed the presence of mRNAs encoding both alpha- and beta-subunits of LH with a marked excess of the mRNA encoding LH beta. Analysis of tumor extracts by gel filtration chromatography confirmed an excess of free LH beta relative to free alpha-subunit. Clinical studies demonstrated that the secretion of LH and alpha-subunit by the tumor increased in response to the acute administration of LHRH (100 micrograms, iv) and decreased during a 4-h dopamine infusion (4 micrograms/kg X min). During a 4-week course of LHRH analog (D-Trp6-Pro9-NEt-LHRH) administration, given as a daily sc dose (8 micrograms/kg X day), serum LH and alpha-subunit concentrations increased 7- and 3-fold, respectively, consistent with a chronic agonist effect. Chronic administration of bromocriptine resulted in reduction of serum LH and alpha-subunit levels to normal.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were conducted to examine the regulation of HLA class II gene expression in human thyroid cells in vitro. Normal human thyroid cells cultured in the absence of lectin or gamma-interferon stimulation lacked detectable HLA-DR cell surface antigen, although low levels of DR alpha-chain-specific mRNA were present. Cyclosporine A, known to inhibit lymphokine production, inhibited basal as well as lectin-mediated increases in levels of DR alpha-chain-specific mRNA and DR surface antigen expression on normal human thyrocytes. Cyclosporine had no effect on the induction of DR antigen gene expression by recombinant gamma-interferon. These data suggested that lectin enhancement of DR antigen expression in human thyroid cells may be mediated by a lymphokine(s) produced in primary human thyroid cell monolayers. This suggestion was confirmed by studies that demonstrated the abrogation of lectin responsiveness by antibody directed against gamma-interferon. Indirect immunofluorescence studies using flow cytometric analyses identified 1.6 +/- 0.2% (mean +/- SD) of cells in primary thyroid cultures as T lymphocytes, a potential source of lymphokine production. Cells derived from thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas demonstrated reduced lectin-mediated increases in DR antigen expression compared to normal thyroid cells. DR expression could be enhanced in these lectin-treated cells, however, by T cell coculture. Dose-response studies demonstrated that human thyroid cells were as sensitive to gamma-interferon induction of DR antigen expression as human monocyte/macrophages. These results indicate that human thyroid cell HLA-DR antigen gene expression is sensitive to low levels of lymphokines, such as gamma-interferon; an intrathyroidal T cell population, which may serve as a source of lymphokine(s), remains associated with thyroid epithelial cells in primary thyroid cultures; and lymphokine-thyroid cell interactions may be implicated in the immunopathology of human autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the role of the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in GH secretion in human somatotrophs and the effects of inhibitors of GH secretion on this mechanism, we studied the effects of 12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and phospholipase C (Plase C) on GH secretion and the interactions of somatostatin (SRIH), bromocriptine, and pertussis toxin (IAP) with TPA or Plase C, using human GH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells in culture. SRIH (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited and TPA (10(-10)-10(-8) M) and Plase C (0.125-1.0 U/mL) stimulated GH secretion. SRIH (10(-9)-10(-7) M) inhibited GH release induced by TPA (10(-8) M) or Plase C (1.0 U/mL). Bromocriptine (10(-8) M) also inhibited 10(-8) M TPA-induced GH secretion. When adenoma cells were treated with 100 ng/mL IAP for 24 h, basal and TPA-induced GH secretion rates did not change. However, the inhibitory effects of SRIH (10(-8) M) or bromocriptine (10(-8) M) on basal and 10(-8) M TPA-stimulated GH secretion were attenuated. In addition, IAP reduced GH secretion induced by 0.5 U/mL Plase C, while SRIH inhibition of Plase C-evoked GH release was diminished by IAP. We conclude that the hydrolysis of PIP2 by Plase C, which causes activation of protein kinase C by 1,2-diacylglycerol and Ca2+ mobilization by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, is a physiological intracellular mechanism leading to GH secretion in human somatotrophs; SRIH inhibits GH secretion mediated by this mechanism, and bromocriptine blocks at least protein kinase C-mediated GH release; the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ni) is involved in these inhibitory effects of SRIH and bromocriptine; and Ni modulates the breakdown of PIP2 by Plase C.\r"

  ".W": "The study was undertaken to investigate whether GHRH causes desensitization in GH-secreting adenomas in analogy to the normal situation. For this purpose, GH secretion after repeated GHRH administration to acromegalic patients in vivo and cultured adenomatous somatotrophs in vitro was studied. Six acromegalic patients and 6 normal subjects received 3 consecutive 50 micrograms GHRH rapid iv injections at 2-h intervals. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after each dose. The acromegalic patients had variable responses to the first injection and in each patient the second and third injections elicited serum GH responses that were quite similar to those after the first one. The GH increment, evaluated as net incremental area under the curve (mean +/- SE; nanograms per ml/120 min) was 2660 +/- 1501 after the first injection, 2176 +/- 1378 after the second injection, and 1978 +/- 1191 after the third injection; P = NS. On the contrary, in normal subjects a marked elevation of GH was observed only after the first injection (net incremental area under the curve, mean +/- SE after the first injection: 710 +/- 154; after the second injection: 6 +/- 39 and after the third injection: 108 +/- 28, P less than 0.01 vs. the first dose). The effect of in vitro GHRH pretreatment on the subsequent response to GHRH was evaluated in monlayer cultures from 12 GH-secreting adenomas. At 10(-8) M, GHRH significantly stimulated GH release from 8 adenomas. The GHRH pretreatment that was effective in inducing desensitization in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells, i.e. preexposure of the cultured cells to 10(-8) M GHRH for 4 h at 37 C, did not abolish the GH response to the subsequent challenge with GHRH (mean percent stimulation: 150 +/- 14% in untreated cells vs. 153 +/- 30% in pretreated cells; P = NS). Only in one adenoma, did GHRH-promoted desensitization occur. No modification was found in GHRH unresponsive adenomas. In the adenomas, not only the efficacy but also the potency of GHRH on GH release after GHRH pretreatment was of the same order of magnitude as in untreated cells. No desensitization to GHRH action occurred when the pretreatment time was prolonged up to 8 h and the GHRH concentration in the preincubation medium was increased to 10(-7) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Urinary sodium excretion decreased from 162 +/- 15 (SEM) meq/24 h before to 97 +/- 10 meq/24 h during fludrocortisone acetate administration (P less than 0.05). Despite continued fludrocortisone acetate administration, sodium excretion subsequently returned to baseline (escape). Plasma ANP increased from 33 +/- 6 pg/ml (control) to 55 +/- 14 pg/ml on the first day of escape (P less than 0.05). Escape was associated with a decrease in PRA from 0.90 +/- 0.22 (control) to 0.26 +/- 0.08 ng/ml X h (escape, P less than 0.05). The escape phenomenon was not associated with a significant change in mean arterial pressure or glomerular filtration rate.

Their mean amplitudes, expressed as a percentage of the 24-h mean, were as high as 20% for glucose, 54% for insulin, and 56% for C-peptide. The oscillations of plasma insulin levels throughout the 24 h were concomitant with those of C-peptide. Rapid 8- to 14-min plasma insulin and glucose oscillations were smaller in magnitude and could only be detected in some segments of the longer period oscillations. These results indicate that in addition to the previously described 8- to 14-min oscillations, plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide oscillate at a mean 80-min periodicity in man during continuous enteral nutrition. These oscillations may reflect a pancreatic oscillatory mechanism and/or cyclic variations in gastrointestinal motility or peripheral glucose uptake.\r"

  ".U": "87138175\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the frequency of pulsatile LHRH stimulation can differentially control LH and FSH secretion in man, we administered low doses of LHRH in pulsatile fashion in several different regimens to men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and presumed endogenous LHRH deficiency. In study 1, four men with IHH received a constant amount of LHRH per day in three different frequencies. After an initial 7-day period of LHRH (5.0 micrograms every 2 h), the men received 2.5 micrograms every 1 h and 7.5 micrograms every 3 h, each for 4 days, in varying order. Frequent blood samples were obtained before LHRH administration and at the end of each regimen. Before LHRH administration, mean serum FSH and LH levels were low [28 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) and 6 +/- 2 ng/mL, respectively], and they increased into the normal adult male range during LHRH treatment. As the frequency of LHRH administration decreased from every 1 to 2 to 3 h, serum FSH levels progressively increased from 99 +/- 33 to 133 +/- 34 to 181 +/- 58 ng/mL (P less than 0.05). Serum LH levels (34 +/- 6, 33 +/- 6, and 34 +/- 5 ng/mL) were significantly higher than those before LHRH administration and did not differ significantly among the three regimens. Total serum testosterone (T), estradiol, and free T levels were increased by LHRH, but were not significantly different during the three regions of LHRH administration. In study 2, three men with IHH received the same amount of LHRH per dose, given in two different pulse frequencies; 2.5 micrograms LHRH were administered in frequencies of every 0.5 h and every 1.5 h, each for 4 days, in varying order. During the 0.5 h frequency, the mean serum FSH level was 42 +/- 13 ng/mL, and it rose to 80 +/- 19 ng/mL during the 1.5 h frequency (P less than 0.05). Corresponding mean serum LH levels were 25 +/- 5 and 27 +/- 4 ng/mL. Serum T and estradiol levels were not significantly different during the two LHRH regimens. We conclude that the frequency of LHRH stimulation can differentially control FSH and LH secretion by the human pituitary gland, and the pattern of hormonal stimulation may be a determinant of target organ response.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the effects of estrogens and androgens on LH pulse frequency and amplitude in male subjects. To assess the role of estrogens we compared the serum LH pulse frequency and amplitude between 3 groups: 8 agonadal subjects receiving no steroid treatment; 6 agonadal subjects continuously treated with 50 micrograms ethinylestradiol/day; and 17 eugonadal men. Mean serum LH levels and LH pulse amplitude were significantly lower in the agonadal subjects receiving estrogens (14.8 +/- 5.4 (SD) U/L and 4.1 +/- 1.5 U/L, respectively) than in the group of agonadal subjects not receiving sex steroid treatment (35.7 +/- 8.4 U/L and 7.3 +/- 2.0 U/L, respectively). The mean LH pulse frequency was 7.1 +/- 1.5/7 h in the group not receiving sex steroid treatment and 6.0 +/- 1.4/7 h in the group receiving estrogens (P NS). The LH pulse frequency in the eugonadal men (3.8 +/- 1.3/7 h) was significantly lower than the frequency in both groups of agonadal subjects. The LH pulse amplitude was of the same magnitude in the estrogen-treated agonadal subjects and in eugonadal men (4.1 +/- 1.5 U/L and 3.5 +/- 1.2 U/L, respectively). The role of androgens was studied in 15 eugonadal male subjects (who presented for female role reassignment) by determining the effects of a novel nonsteroidal androgen receptor blocker, Anandron, on basal and LH-releasing hormone (LHRH)-stimulated serum LH/FSH levels; LH pulse frequency and amplitude; sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin levels; and serum PRL levels during an 8-week period. Basal and LHRH-stimulated LH levels and testosterone rose progressively during the first 6 weeks and reached a plateau thereafter, while estradiol levels continued to increase somewhat. The LH pulse amplitude and frequency had increased after 6 weeks (3.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 4.5 +/- 1.2 U/L and 4.4 +/- 2.4 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.1 pulses/7 h, respectively). Basal FSH levels were not affected while LHRH-stimulated FSH levels progressively decreased from 2 to 6 weeks, after which they did not change. Along with the rise of estradiol levels an increase of sex hormone-binding globulin and PRL levels occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Conditioned monkey Sertoli cell culture medium (m-SCCM), when added to pituitary cells from 6-week-old male rats, inhibited the basal secretion of FSH but not that of LH. This specificity was lost after the addition of GnRH; mSCCM inhibited not only FSH but also LH release, determined by both RIA and mouse interstitial cell bioassay, from pituitary cells exposed for 6 h to 10 nM GnRH. FSH-inhibiting activity persisted when m-SCCM was boiled for 30 min, but activity was lost after incubation for 1 h at 37 C with 0.1% trypsin. m-SCCM inhibin activity was completely retained by Concanavalin A-Sepharose and could be eluted with 0.2 M alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. Gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography with a Superose-12 column revealed inhibin activity between 20-60K, with the greatest activity at 40K. Our results indicate that primate Sertoli cells produce an inhibin-like factor which could play a role in controlling gonadotropin secretion in males.\r"

We measured arterial and venous plasma DOPA concentrations in healthy subjects at rest, patients who had undergone regional sympathectomies or were undergoing general anesthesia, and subjects during procedures (tilt, oral clonidine, or iv isoproterenol, yohimbine, trimethaphan, or diazepam) known to affect plasma norepinephrine levels. We also measured plasma DOPA in laboratory animals during anesthesia, after adrenalectomy, or after administration of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, which competitively inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, the intraneuronal enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. In virtually all healthy subjects there was an arteriovenous increment in plasma DOPA (mean increase, 32%; P less than 0.001), whereas in sympathectomized patients there was not (mean decrease, 16%; P less than 0.001 compared with healthy subjects). Except for small decreases after clonidine treatment, none of the above procedures affected plasma DOPA levels. Plasma DOPA decreased during general anesthesia and returned to baseline upon reversal of the anesthesia. Adrenalectomy had no effect on plasma DOPA. alpha-Methyl-para-tyrosine decreased plasma DOPA by 62% (P less than 0.01). The results support the suggestion that DOPA can pass across sympathetic neuronal membranes to reach the general circulation. If so, then the regional rate of appearance of DOPA in plasma may be related to the regional rate of tyrosine hydroxylation. Conversely, DOPA taken up from the circulation may provide a source for catecholamine biosynthesis in tissues devoid of tyrosine hydroxylase.\r"

Eight blind and six normal boys, aged 7-10 yr, living at an institute for blind subjects in Naples, Italy, were studied. Each had a combined GnRH (100 micrograms) and TRH (200 micrograms) test at 0800 h after nocturnal rest. Plasma LH, FSH, PRL, and T levels were measured by RIA. The blind boys had basal plasma LH, FSH, and T levels significantly lower than those in the normal boys (P less than 0.01 for all three); plasma PRL basal levels were similar to those in the normal boys. The blind boys, moreover, had lower peak LH, FSH, and PRL (P less than 0.01 for all three peaks) levels in response to GnRH-TRH. Our results, similar to those found by others in patients with delayed puberty or with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, suggest that light stimuli influence neuroendocrine-gonadal activity in humans, as in other mammals; and in blind prepubertal boys, impaired hormone secretion could cause a delay of pubertal development or more severe hypogonadism.\r"

Major findings included the following. Coconut oil feeding increased concentrations of all classes of plasma lipoproteins without altering lipoprotein size, suggesting an increase in particle number. The percentage of saturated fatty acids in the cholesteryl esters (CE) of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and HDL reached 40% with coconut oil feeding. This value probably constitutes a minimum estimate of the CE which were of intracellular rather than intraplasmic origin. The CE in LDL and HDL were nearly identical suggesting virtually complete equilibration by the core lipid transfer reaction. The CE in very low density lipoproteins, in contrast, were significantly more saturated than those in LDL and HDL irrespective of diet. Lower HDL levels on the corn oil diet were associated with higher fractional catabolic rates for both apolipoprotein A-I (0.42 vs. 0.31 d-1) and apolipoprotein A-II (0.45 vs. 0.30 d-1).\r"

Using the cytochalasin B binding assay to measure glucose transporters in subcellular membrane subfractions, we found that insulin induced translocation of intracellular glucose transporters to the cell surface. Isoelectric focusing of glucose transporters photolabeled with [3H]cytochalasin B revealed two distinct glucose transporter isoforms in low density microsomes focusing at pH 5.6 and pH 6.4, but only the pH 5.6 isoform was detectable in plasma membranes and only the pH 6.4 form was found in the high density microsomes. Insulin recruited only the pH 5.6 glucose transporter from the low density microsomes to the plasma membrane with no effect on the pH 6.4 transporter isoform. The results suggest that the pH 6.4 species is an immature form of the glucose transporter initially located in the high-density microsome fraction, which then migrates to the low-density microsomes where it matures (converted to pH 5.6 species) and becomes available for insulin-mediated recruitment to the plasma membrane.\r"

Increases of plasma ANF ranged from less than 20% to over 12-fold. Similarly, the natriuretic response to NI varied markedly from none to 500%. There was a strong correlation between peak ANF and peak UNaV (r = 0.67; P less than 0.025), but none between peak V and peak plasma ANF (r = -0.10; P greater than 0.5). These findings suggest that an increase in plasma ANF contributes to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiological role for ANF in modulating volume homeostasis in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism for the increased glucose transport response to insulin in adipose cells from chronically hyperinsulinemic rats was examined. Rats were infused with insulin s.c. for 2 wk. Isolated adipose cells were incubated with and without insulin, 3-O-methylglucose transport was measured, and glucose transporters in subcellular membrane fractions were assessed by cytochalasin B binding. Adipose cells from insulin-treated rats showed no change in basal but a 55% increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity compared with those from control rats (7.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.5 fmol/cell per min, mean +/- SEM) and a corresponding increase in the concentration of glucose transporters in the plasma membranes (44 +/- 5 vs. 32 +/- 6 pmol/mg of membrane protein). In the low-density microsomes, glucose transporter concentrations in both basal and insulin-stimulated states were the same, but the total numbers were greater in cells from the insulin-treated rats because of a 39% increase in low-density microsomal protein. Therefore, chronic experimental hyperinsulinemia in the rat enhances the stimulatory action of insulin on glucose transport in the adipose cell by increasing the concentration of glucose transporters in the plasma membranes. This results from an enlarged intracellular pool due to increased intracellular protein and enhanced glucose transporter translocation in response to insulin.\r"

To study their fine structure, two techniques were used: a superimposition technique consisting of comparison of the same cells in semithin and electron microscopic preparations, and an immunocytochemical technique on ultrathin sections using the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Our results show that (a) the same cells are positive for both His-Pro DKP and glucagon/glicentin, (b) His-Pro DKP immunoreactive cells possess extremely electron-opaque secretory granules, implying that these cells correspond to the A cells, and (c) His-Pro DKP immunoreactivity is found over the secretory granules. We hypothesize that the two peptides His-Pro DKP and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) have independent origins, since TRH is found in the B cells.\r"

Cells treated with sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) showed similarly high TXB2 synthesis rates when diC8 was added concomitantly with a subthreshold concentration of TPA or when given in multiple doses. These activities depended on de novo synthesis of prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase because: microsomal PGH synthase activity showed large increases in Vmax values, and mass measurements of PGH synthase revealed the presence of PGH synthase in differentiating cells whereas the enzyme was undetectable in control cells. These results indicate that macrophage differentiation is associated with stimulation of TXB2 synthesis that requires both activation of protein kinase C and de novo synthesis of PGH synthase.\r"

Although products of coagulation can lead to clot formation, thereby potentiating organ damage, recent work has shown that low concentrations of thrombin can protect animals from the shock state. Because these amounts of thrombin also lead to formation in vivo of the anticoagulant enzyme, activated protein C, we examined the role of protein C in modulation of Escherichia coli shock in baboons. First, we infused activated protein C and lethal concentrations of E. coli organisms, which prevented the coagulopathic, hepatotoxic, and lethal effects of E. coli. Second, using an antibody to protein C we blocked protein C activation in vivo to determine if this influenced the response to lethal and sublethal concentrations of E. coli organisms. Under these conditions the response to lethal concentrations of E. coli organisms was made more severe and the response to sublethal concentrations of E. coli was made lethal. The coagulopathic, hepatotoxic, and lethal responses in this latter case were prevented by infusion of exogenous protein C.\r"

A significant correlation between the degree of leucocyte aggregation and CRP concentration was noted in patients with bacterial infections and in a group of patients with various inflammatory conditions. In contrast, there was no correlation between the extent of leucocyte aggregation and CRP concentrations in patients with viral infections, malignancies, or pregnancy. The presence or absence of aggregated leucocytes can help in differentiating between the respective bacterial or viral infections. The serum concentrations of CRP were increased in both types of infection, although when a quantitative CRP assay was used, considerably higher concentrations were detected in bacterial diseases.\r"

Possible mechanisms of xanthoma formation are discussed. Thus juvenile xanthogranulomatosis should be considered in adults with normolipemic xanthomatosis.\r"

The mean plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor increased from 117 +/- 53 pg/ml in sinus rhythm to 251 +/- 137 pg/ml during laboratory-induced supraventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.005). Right atrial pressures were recorded in 12 patients; the baseline atrial pressure was 4.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg and increased to 7.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg during supraventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.005). A modest but significant linear relation was noted between the changes in plasma atrial natriuretic factor and right atrial pressure measurements during induced supraventricular tachycardia (r = 0.60, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, changes in atrial rhythm and pressure may be an important factor modulating the release of atrial natriuretic factor in the circulation and raised levels of this hormone may be a contributing factor for the polyuria and the hypotension associated with paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.\r"

The first preparation (G11021) has been used in all clinical trials reported to date, whereas the second preparation (G11035) is now produced for future clinical use. When both preparations were infused intravenously for 90 minutes at rates of 4 to 11 micrograms/kg per min, plateau levels of the drug in plasma ranged from 0.52 +/- 0.15 to 1.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml and were linearly correlated with the infusion rate. However, G11035 yielded plasma levels that were approximately 35% lower than those obtained with G11021 (p less than 0.025). The postinfusion disappearance rate of the drug from plasma could be described by a two compartment disposition model with the following pharmacokinetic variables. For G11021, an alpha half-life of 4.1 to 6.3 minutes, a beta half-life of 41 to 50 minutes, a central compartment volume of 3.5 to 5.4 liters, a total distribution volume of 28 to 44 liters and a plasma clearance of 450 to 640 ml/min. For G11035 these variables were 3.6 to 4.6 minutes, 39 to 53 minutes, 3.8 to 6.6 liters, 27 to 40 liters and 520 to 1,000 ml/min, respectively, indicating that G11035 is cleared more rapidly from the circulation. G11021 at 4 micrograms/kg per min and G11035 at 7 micrograms/kg per min did not effectively produce thrombolysis. A coronary reperfusion rate of 81% (13 of 16 patients) was obtained with 5.3 micrograms/kg per min of G11021 and a rate of 86% (6 of 7 patients) was obtained with 9.4 micrograms/kg per min of G11035.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The doses of terfenadine used were 60 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg, producing small but significant bronchodilator effect with all three doses at 2 hours. This response was still present at 4 hours. However, the provocative dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1 for methacholine was unaffected by all three doses of terfenadine. The bronchodilator response induced by antihistamines, including terfenadine, suggests an increased resting tone mediated by the constant presence of free histamine in the vicinity of H1 receptors in the airways and that methacholine acts directly on the airway muscarinic receptors and is not involved in local histamine release.\r"

One hundred twelve RQs were calculated from data obtained using indirect calorimetry. Seventy-four measurements were made while patients were receiving parenteral nutrition--55 with glucose and amino acid (GAAPN) and 19 with glucose, fat, and amino acid (GFAAPN). Thirty-eight measurements were made while patients were receiving either oral or nasoenterally administered carbohydrate, fat, and protein in the form of standard hospital diets or liquid defined formula diets (CFPEN). The mean RQ of the GAAPN patients was significantly higher than those of both the GFAAPN and the CFPEN patients. RQs were greater than 1.0 in a significantly greater number of the GAAPN patients than the GFAAPN or CFPEN patients. The route of nutrient intake did not influence energy nutrient utilization, as determined by RQ. This study suggests that nutrition support regimens containing fat, in addition to carbohydrate and protein, are more efficiently utilized to meet the energy requirements of hospitalized patients than are regimens containing only glucose and amino acid.\r"

Total enzyme activity was shown to be significantly, (p less than .001) lower in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus muscle obtained from 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. Similarly, values for the active form of enzyme were significantly lower, (p less than .001) in all three muscle types of 24-month-old compared with 2-month-old rats. This age-related decline in glycogen synthase activity was not due to a reduction in the affinity of the enzyme for its activator (glucose-6-phosphate) and was independent of the concentration of substrate (UDP-glucose) in the assay system. Because similar age-related changes were seen when enzyme activity was expressed per milligram of muscle protein or per gram of muscle tissue, the fall in enzyme activity was not a simple function of an age-related decline in muscle mass. Glycogen levels also were reduced significantly in tensor fascia latae, biceps femoris, and soleus of 24-month-old rats compared with 2-month-old rats, p less than .001. These results document an age-related change in a key enzyme regulating glycogen metabolism in muscle.\r"

Each was tested in soluble form or was immobilized by adhering it to the wells of plastic microtiter wells. Soluble anti-CD3 did not induce proliferation of accessory cell (AC)-depleted T4 cells. In contrast, immobilized anti-CD3 induced T4 cell IL 2 production and proliferation in the complete absence of AC. When T4 cells were stimulated with high density immobilized anti-CD3, responses did not require AC, IL 2, or Mab directed at the Tp44 molecule (9.3). In contrast, responses stimulated by lower densities of immobilized anti-CD3 were enhanced by IL 2, AC, and 9.3, and with even lower densities of immobilized anti-CD3 proliferation, required these additional signals. A variety of other immobilized Mab directed at T cell surface proteins including class I major histocompatibility complex encoded gene products, CD2, CD5, 4F2, and Tp44, did not induce proliferation even in the presence of IL 2. Anti-CD4 Mab (66.1) inhibited immobilized anti-CD3-stimulated T4 cell responses, with a greater degree of inhibition noted when lower densities of immobilized anti-CD3 were used to stimulate T4 cells. The data demonstrate that stimulation of T4 cells by anti-CD3 is completely AC independent when the antibody is immobilized onto a surface. Furthermore, the results indicate that maximal stimulation requires multiple interactions with anti-CD3 without internalization of the CD3 molecule. The observation that additional signals are required to support T4 cell proliferation when the density of immobilized anti-CD3 is diminished suggests that these are necessary only when insufficient interactions with the CD3 molecule have occurred to transmit a maximal activation signal to the cell. Finally, the results indicate that anti-CD4 provides a direct inhibitory signal to the T4 cell, the effect of which is inversely proportional to the intensity of the activation signal.\r"

Irradiation of the T cells before culture usually augmented the PFC response. An IgG2a mAb (454) induced PFC in all donors tested, whereas two IgG1 mAb (147 and 446) induced PFC in only 80% of the donors tested. This heterogeneity in PFC response to IgG1 anti-CD3 mAb strictly paralleled the heterogeneity in proliferative response to IgG1 anti-CD3 mAb and was governed by cells within the non-T population. In IgG1 anti-CD3 high responders (HR), all anti-CD3 mAb tested induced Tac expression. In IgG1 anti-CD3 low responders (LR), mAb 454 induced Tac expression, but mAb 147 did not. However, when the cultures were supplemented with exogenous interleukin 2, Tac expression and PFC generation in response to mAb 147 was similar to the response to mAb 454 in both HR and LR. The addition of anti-Tac to the cultures partially inhibited anti-CD3-induced PFC generation. These studies indicate that anti-CD3 mAb can lead to B cell differentiation under appropriate experimental conditions and may be valuable in studying polyclonal T cell-dependent B cell differentiation in normal and disease states.\r"

Analysis of the ability of cloned, Ia-restricted, L3T4+ T cells to induce an in vitro anti-hapten antibody response to hapten-carrier conjugates allowed the definition of three functional subtypes. To examine whether these functional subtypes also differed in the production of soluble mediators, supernatants of the cloned lines were examined for the production of T cell growth factors and factors inducing increased expression of Ia glycoproteins on small resting B cells. All of the cloned lines produced T cell growth factors that could be further differentiated by inhibition with monoclonal antibodies. None of the Ia-restricted, L3T4+ cloned T cell lines that failed to produce IL 4/BSF-1 could provide helper function. Thus, the activation of antigen-specific B cells by helper T cells appears to require IL 4/BSF-1 as a necessary but not sufficient signal for differentiation into antibody-forming cells.\r"

  ".W": "1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the biologically active form of vitamin D3, has been shown to inhibit the activation of T cell hybridomas and heterogeneous populations of mononuclear leukocytes. Because the response of various clones to 1,25(OH)2D3 may differ, we have examined the proliferative effects of the steroid on an antigen-specific cloned, nontransformed T helper cell line (D10.G4.1 [D10 cells]), and find that in contrast to these previous studies, the steroid is a potent stimulator of lectin-induced proliferation. In these experiments, D10 cells were incubated with concanavalin A and 1,25(OH)2D3, and although the lectin or steroid alone has minimal proliferative effects, their co-addition prompts up to a 50-fold increase in 3H-TdR incorporation at a concentration of 2.5 to 5 X 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3, with significant mitogenesis occurring at 0.1 to 0.3 X 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 have similar activity, but at concentrations two to three times greater than that of 1,25(OH)2D3, reflecting their relative affinities for the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. In addition, lectin treatment enhances 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor capacity fourfold to fivefold, an event coupled with the appearance of positive cooperativity. Although the steroid does not affect the quantity of bioassayable T cell growth factors as assessed by HT-2 cell proliferation, the expression of immunoreactive IL 2 receptors by lectin-activated D10 cells exposed to 1,25(OH)2D3 is enhanced. In contrast to its proliferative effect in the absence of IL 1, 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts biphasic effects on D10 replication when this monokine is present. Specifically, this steroid augments D10 proliferation at low concentrations of recombinant IL 1, but as the abundance of the monokine increases in the presence of 10(-10) to 10(-8) M 1,25(OH)2D3, the peak response of D10 cells to optimal IL 1 concentrations is diminished. Therefore, in this clone, 1,25(OH)2D3 presents itself as a regulator of T helper cell proliferation.\r"

The principle advantages of this recording system are these: Indo-1 is highly fluorescent; hence, loading concentrations that introduce artifacts in the reported [Ca2+]i signal may be avoided. The measurement of [Ca2+]i by fluorescence ratio corrects for nonuniform dye uptake, making possible quantitative estimates of [Ca2+]i in single cells and an assessment of the variability of population responses. Baseline recordings of unstimulated lymphocytes indicated a narrow, stable range of [Ca2+]i (75 to 125 nM). The [Ca2+]i rise induced by various anti-Ig preparations exhibited considerable heterogeneity. The initial mean value for F(ab')2 anti-Ig-stimulated cells peaked above 1 microM and was due only to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. A steady state elevation of [Ca2+]i was reached by 5 min and persisted for hours. Cells stimulated with intact anti-Ig reached similar initial peak [Ca2+]i values, but then declined toward baseline. This difference was due to membrane Ig-IgG Fc receptor (mIg-Fc gamma R) cross-linkage, because blocking the Fc gamma R with a monoclonal antibody made the [Ca2+]i responses to F(ab')2 and intact anti-Ig identical. The attenuation of the [Ca2+]i signal by mIg-Fc gamma R cross-linkage is proceeded by a corresponding Fc gamma-mediated reduction in anti-Ig-induced inositol trisphosphate elevation. These findings outline a biochemical basis for mIg- and Fc gamma R-mediated activation and regulation intrinsic to the B cell, and demonstrate the advantages of indo-1 over quin2 for fluorescent measurement of [Ca2+]i in small cells.\r"

A subset of these patients has recently been described with a chronic T cell leukemia of large granular lymphocytes (LGCL). To examine the spectrum of lymphocyte abnormalities in FS and LGCL, we examined phenotypic and genotypic properties of lymphocytes from eight FS patients. In two of these FS patients, we observed an elevated proportion of T cells with an unusual phenotype (CD3+/Leu-7+/Leu-8-/CR3+) (46 +/- 5% of mononuclear cells). The FS lymphocytes had large granular morphology on Wright-Giemsa stain and were active in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic activity. This phenotype, morphology, and activity was similar to LGCL patients except that the latter T cells additionally expressed the Fc-IgG receptor recognized by monoclonal antibody Leu-11 (CD 15). In the remaining six FS patients, the proportion of CD3+/Leu-7+/CR 3+ T cells was only 10 +/- 8%, which was not significantly different from age-matched normal subjects (6.6 +/- 2.2%). To determine the clonality of T lymphocytes in FS and LGCL, we examined DNA for rearrangements of the T cell antigen receptor beta-chain (Ti beta) and gamma-chain (Ti gamma) genes by using Southern blotting techniques. We found a clonal rearrangement of the Ti beta 1 and Ti gamma genes in both LGCL patients. In contrast, no clonal rearrangements of Ti beta or Ti gamma genes were detected in lymphocytes from the FS patients. These results indicate that FS patients are heterogeneous in their phenotype and that one subset exhibits polyclonal expansion of an unusual lymphocyte subset.\r"

An original dot immunobinding assay and a quick blot hybridization with chain-specific HLA class II probes allowed quantification of HLA DR antigens and chain transcripts on small-size samples of adherent synovial lining cells (ASLC) from normal individuals or RA patients. These methods associated with Western blot techniques detecting class II and beta-chain expression showed that ASLC from RA patients freshly put in short-term culture expressed greater amounts of class II transcripts and proteins than ASLC from controls. Class II proteins and mRNA rapidly disappeared in culture. Recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) induced their re-expression. A study of the kinetics and levels of the HLA-D products showed similar patterns of activation in RA patients and controls. A qualitative analysis of HLA class II antigens synthesized in ASLC after rIFN-gamma induction was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. It revealed a normal pattern for alpha- and beta-chains in ASLC from normal and RA patients, thus eliminating the possibility that abnormal protein structure of Ia antigen expressed on ASLC is responsible for the activation of T cell immune responses in RA. Nevertheless, the invariant chain exhibited a particular pattern in ASLC with additional basic spots, and this might interfere with transport and glycosylation of HLA class II antigens in such cells.\r"

After 24 hr preactivation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), 11 out of 32 CD4+ clones from the first and 17 out of 36 CD4+ clones from the second tonsil donor showed the ability to induce IgE synthesis in vitro by B cells from both allergic and nonallergic individuals, whereas none of 10 CD8+ clones nor T blasts of PHA-induced cell lines obtained from unfractionated T cell suspensions of the same tonsils had such an effect. Seven of the 11 T cell clones from the first tonsil donor active on IgE production after pre-activation with PHA also induced IgE synthesis in vitro by nonallergic and allergic B cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. Under the same experimental conditions, virtually all of the T cell clones able to induce IgE synthesis in vitro by target B cells showed the ability to stimulate IgG and IgM production as well. T cell clones were also established from the peripheral blood of a nonallergic donor and were tested for their ability to induce IgE synthesis in autologous B cells. After preactivation with PHA, seven out of 35 CD4+ clones induced the production of detectable amounts of both IgE and IgG in autologous B cells. The addition to the cultures of PHA-stimulated unfractionated T cells inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the IgE but not the IgG synthesis induced by an autologous helper T cell clone in autologous B cells. Taken together, these data indicate that a remarkable proportion of human T cell clones upon triggering of the CD3 molecular complex were able to provide help for the synthesis of IgE in B cells from both allergic and nonallergic individuals. The successful induction of IgE synthesis by single T cell clones was apparently related to the lack of concomitant suppressor activity to which IgE-producing cells appeared to be exquisitely sensitive.\r"

Little is known about the target molecules in this system, however, because the low titer and low avidity of the most interesting antibodies limit their utility in conventional immunoprecipitation analyses. Therefore, Western blotting was used to demonstrate binding of IgG in anti-T cell antibody-positive SLE sera to four surface membrane molecules shared by peripheral T cells and HSB-2 cells. Molecules of Mr 90,000 and 55,000 were particularly reactive: each target was stained by IgG anti-lymphocyte antibodies in 11 patient sera (approximately 85%) in the panel. Targets of Mr 37,000 and 105,000 were encountered less frequently (six of 13 and one of 13 patients, respectively). It is unlikely that alloantibodies contributed to the staining patterns observed because reactivity with the four targets was consistently present when cell preparations from multiple unrelated donors were examined. The target molecules were localized to the plasma membrane by whole cell absorption/elution experiments, by the failure of chromatin (DNA/histone) to absorb antibodies to these antigens, and through the use of purified membranes as substrate for Western blotting. With the possible exception of the 105,000 Mr molecule, which is a major target in the IgM anti-T cell antibody system, evidence for the existence of neoantigens as a basis for increased reactivity of SLE IgG with activated T cells was not obtained. The identity of the IgG antibody-reactive molecules with respect to known T cell antigens was not determined, although evidence against the existence of antibodies to Tac (IL 2 receptor) and the transferrin receptor was obtained in monoclonal antibody pre-clearing experiments. Nonetheless, the observation that a limited number of major IgG autoantibody target antigens on activated peripheral T cells are shared by HSB-2 cells, a primitive T cell line expressing few of the differentiation antigens characteristic of mature T cells, should provide a basis for more definitive characterization of antigens in this system in the future.\r"

MRL-lpr mice had significantly more peritoneal cells (MAC and lymphocytes) than did control mice. In endotoxin-free conditions, MRL-lpr MAC were similar to C3H/HeN MAC in their baseline, and IFN-gamma and/or LPS enhanced cytolysis of 3T12 fibrosarcoma tumor cells. Compared with C3H/HeN MAC, MRL-lpr MAC had a significant increase in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity against sheep erythrocytes. This enhanced activity was not accompanied by a similar increase in adherence and/or phagocytosis of the same targets. Finally, in response to phorbol myristate acetate stimulation, both resident and peptone-induced MAC from MRL-lpr mice produced significantly more hydrogen peroxide than did those from control mice. These results indicate that MAC from MRL-lpr mice display features of selective \"activation\", and suggest that MAC or their products may play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders seen in autoimmune diseases.\r"

Although resting T cells lacked specific binding capacity for rTNF-alpha, high affinity (Kd 70 pM) TNF receptors were de novo induced upon primary activation of T cells. Comparison of TNF receptor expression with that of high affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptors, respectively, revealed similarities to IL 2-receptor expression with respect to kinetics of induction. However, maximum expression of TNF receptors (approximately equal to 5000/cell at day 6) and subsequent decline occurred approximately 3 days after the peak of IL 2-receptor expression. In contrast, no change in the expression of IFN-gamma receptors (Kd 10 pM, 300 to 400 receptors/cell) was found in the course of T cell activation. On activated TNF receptor positive T cells, TNF-alpha exerted multiple stimulatory activities. Thus TNF increased the expression of HLA-DR antigens and high affinity IL 2 receptors. As a consequence, TNF-treated T cells showed an enhanced proliferative response to IL 2. Moreover, TNF-alpha was effective as a co-stimulator of IL 2-dependent IFN-gamma production. These data indicate that TNF-alpha may regulate growth and functional activities of normal T cells.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) from cultured mononuclear cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation is inhibited by monoclonal nonspecific suppressor factor (MNSF), a lymphokine produced by murine T cell hybridoma. In an attempt to develop a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) with specific reactivity against MNSF, a cell fusion technique that incorporated immune murine splenocytes and HAT-sensitive murine myeloma cells was used. Cross-reactivity experiments confirmed that the MAb (MO6) does not bind to unrelated proteins such as bovine serum albumin, mouse IgG, and murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). There are no effects when anti-IFN-gamma antibodies are used with MNSF. As far as biological activity is concerned, MO6 inhibits in vitro the activity of MNSF in terms of the Ig secretion from cultured lymphocytes. By using MO6, affinity chromatography and immunoblotting were performed. The MNSF on the SDS-PAGE showed a band with m.w. of approximately 70,000, indicating the formation of an aggregate in saline; but after treatment with 0.4 M pyridine-acetic acid buffer, separate bands of 24,000 and 16,000 daltons were evident. Therefore MO6 recognizes 70,000 and both 24,000 and 16,000 daltons. Thus we confirmed by using this MAb and affinity chromatography, the existence of human counterpart, human nonspecific suppressor factor (hNSF), in supernatant from concanavalin A-stimulated T cells. When hNSF was fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), the activity was found in a region corresponding to 70,000 daltons. However, when fractionated in pyridine-acetic acid buffer, hNSF activity was distributed in a slightly wider range of 15,000 to 30,000 daltons. Physicochemical analysis showed that the purified hNSF is resistant to either heating at 56 degrees C or to 2-mercaptoethanol treatment; however, it is labile to acidification at pH 2.0 and is also sensitive to protease treatment, the characteristics of which were similar to those of murine MNSF. Thus MO6 was confirmed to be a pertinent tool for isolation of hNSF, as well as for murine MNSF.\r"

  ".W": "We have established BCL1 CL-3 cells capable of responding to B15-TRF and interleukin 2 (IL 2). This clone has both high affinity and low affinity receptors for IL 2 (IL 2R), but IL 2 by itself did not stimulate either proliferation or immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion. B15-TRF, which possesses both growth and differentiation activity, causes an increase in size of CL-3 cells and renders CL-3 cells responsive to IL 2, including an increased expression of IL 2R (eight-fold to 10-fold) and the differentiation of CL-3 cells into Ig secretion (60 to 80% of cultured cells). CL-3 cells pretreated with B15-TRF for 12 hr become competent to respond to IL 2 by up-regulation of IL 2R within 12 hr. In contrast CL-3 cells pretreated with IL 2 for 12 hr required 24 hr B15-TRF stimulation to result in IL 2R up-regulation. Thus the ordered action of B15-TRF and IL 2 is the most effective operational pathway for the up-regulation of IL 2R. This IL 2-mediated IL 2R up-regulation and induction of Ig synthesis depends upon the concentration of IL 2 in the culture. Both responses seem to be caused by IL 2 molecules bound to high affinity IL 2R. However, the possibility of involvement of low affinity IL 2R can not be vigorously excluded. In fact the level of IL 2 required for a response is far higher than that needed for activated T cell proliferation. This cloned BCL1 subline promises to be a useful tool for studying the regulation and mechanisms of B cell responses.\r"

  ".W": "T cell-replacing factor (TRF) is known to play a critical role in the regulation of B cell growth and differentiation. In this study, the role of TRF in the expression of mRNA for both IgM and IgG1 class was investigated. The TRF was purified from cellfree supernatants from a T cell hybridoma, B151K12. RNA was isolated from chronic B cell leukemia (BCL1) cells, DNP-KLH-primed B cells, or normal B cells cultured with or without LPS, and LPS plus TRF or LPS plus BSF-1. The steady state level of isotype-specific mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis with a mu-specific or a gamma 1-specific probe. It was demonstrated that BCL1 and purified B cells cocultured with TRF expresses increased levels (twofold and fourfold, respectively) of secreted forms of mu mRNA. Purified B cells from DNP-KLH-primed mice also expressed increased levels (twofold to fourfold) of mu as well as gamma 1 mRNA for secreted form by stimulation with TRF. Total expression of mu mRNA, however, was approximately threefold higher than that of gamma 1 mRNA. The stimulation of normal B cells with LPS plus TRF induced an increase in the levels of mu mRNA and gamma 1 mRNA expression, fourfold and threefold, respectively. However, the levels of gamma 1 mRNA expression was one-third of that induced in B cells stimulated with LPS plus BSF-1. These results indicate that TRF preferentially induces increased levels of secreted type of mu mRNA and induces less gamma 1 mRNA than BSF-1. The differential role of TRF from BSF-1 in the expression of Ig mRNA will be discussed.\r"

  ".U": "87139225\r", 
  ".W": "To dissect mechanisms of arachidonic acid (20:4) metabolism in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM), two distinct cell populations were investigated, resident and BCG-activated rabbit alveolar macrophages. After purified resident PAM were labeled overnight with [3H]20:4, radioactivity was localized primarily within lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid (L(bis)PA) (13.1% +/- 1.7), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22.8% +/- 0.8), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) (26.7% +/- 1.7), with lesser amounts recovered in phosphatidylserine plus phosphatidylinositol (PS/PI) (9.2 +/- 0.8%). By contrast, analysis of the phospholipid classes from prelabeled BCG-activated PAM revealed that the amount of [3H]20:4 contained in L(bis)PA was profoundly decreased (4.7% +/- 0.4), p less than 0.003), whereas [3H]20:4 contained within other BCG phospholipids remained unchanged. Moreover, L(bis)PA, which composed 18.6% +/- 1.2 of the total phospholipid phosphorus of resident PAM, was reduced to 4.1% +/- 0.1 in BCG-activated macrophages (p less than 0.01). Phospholipase A2 from snake venom or from pancreas failed to release 20:4 from L(bis)PA, and lipase (phospholipase A1) from Rhizopus delmar liberated no more than one-third of this arachidonate. These results suggest that much of the arachidonate is not mobilized by classical phospholipases A1 and A2. When [3H]20:4-labeled PAM were stimulated with 1 microM 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a loss of [3H]20:4 was observed from L(bis)PA, PE, PC, and PS/PI, with a concomitant increase in the synthesis of Hete and leukotriene C4. BCG-activated PAM exposed to either TPA or 3.8 microM calcium ionophore A23187 liberated [3H]20:4 solely from PE and PC, with diminished 20:4 oxidative metabolism. Analysis of the specific radioactivities of phospholipids obtained from resident PAM prelabeled with [3H]20:4 or [32P]i demonstrated that the specific activity of [32P]L(bis)PA was negligible, whereas that of [3H]20:4 was quite high. In addition, L(bis)PA deacylation induced by TPA in resident PAM was always accompanied by a corresponding loss of [3H]20:4 from phosphatidylinositol (PI), suggesting that metabolism of this novel phospholipid proceeded by a deacylation-reacylation reaction rather than by de novo synthesis. BCG-activated PAM, which exhibited depressed eicosanoid formation, consistently failed to deacylate [3H]20:4 from L(bis)PA or PI. These studies demonstrate that, unlike 20:4 derived from PE and PC by BCG-activated PAM, L(bis)PA may indeed provide a novel source of 20:4 that is tightly coupled to the lipoxygenase pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation of the human neutrophil NADPH-oxidase has been demonstrated through the activation of protein kinase C (PK-C), using light membrane fractions from nitrogen-cavitated cells. Both arachidonic acid (AA) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) can also generate an active oxidase in cellfree systems. That the source of O2- with AA and SDS activation is the same NADPH-oxidase as previously studied was confirmed by the similar pH optima and Km values for NADPH as those previously described for the O2- -generating activity harvested from pre-stimulated human neutrophils. In contrast to the stimulation by PMA, however, the stimulation of the NADPH-oxidase by AA and SDS does not appear to require protein kinase C activation: the action of AA and SDS is independent of the addition of PK-C cofactors to the system, and the inhibitor of PK-C activity, H-7, had no effect on the stimulation by AA or SDS. AA and SDS activation are comparable, but the level of NADPH-oxidase expression is sixfold greater with each of these agents than that obtained with a reconstituted PK-C system. The basis of this difference in oxidase expression is unclear, but these findings suggest strongly that although activated PK-C is capable of stimulating a dormant NADPH-oxidase in a cellfree system, this is not the sole pathway for oxidase activation.\r"

  ".U": "87139227\r", 
  ".W": "In contrast to our previous report (Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 134:587, 1986), we now find that protein kinase C (PKC) is mobilized in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) stimulated with platelet-activating factor (PAF) or leukotriene (LT)B4. Thus nanomolar concentrations of each compound caused PMN to lose cytosolic, PKC-specific protein phosphorylating activity, as well as receptors for phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Smaller gains in membrane-associated PMA receptors accompanied these changes. Diacylglycerol and PMA had very similar effects on PKC. However, unlike these direct PKC activators, PAF and LTB4 induced only moderate decreases in cytosolic PKC; acted only on PMN pretreated with cytochalasin B; did not mobilize PKC in disrupted PMN or activate PKC in a cell-free system; and with respect to PAF, induced responses that partially reversed within 30 min. Furthermore, PAF, LTB4, and several of their structural analogues mobilized PKC at concentrations correlating closely with their respective affinities for cellular LTB4 or PAF receptors. Thus PAF and LTB4 acted by indirect and apparently receptor-mediated mechanisms. Four observations indicated that the cytochalasin B-dependent degranulating actions of PAF and LTB4 involved PKC. First, PKC mobilization and degranulation occurred at the same stimulus concentrations. Second, 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate dramatically enhanced both PKC mobilization and degranulation when elicited by PAF; it had relatively little influence on LTB4-induced responses. Third, PAF-induced mobilization (t1/2 less than 7 sec) preceded degranulation (t1/2 approximately 20 sec). Finally, a PKC blocker, polymyxin B, was similarly effective in inhibiting degranulation responses to PAF, LTB4, and PMA. Because stimulated PMN may produce and use PAF, LTB4, and 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoate as secondary intracellular mediators, our results implicate PKC as a central and potentially critical regulator of function.\r"

IgE receptor but not A23187 ionophore stimulation of these cells also resulted in phosphoinositide breakdown. In these experiments, the culture of these cells with dexamethasone inhibited IgE- and ionophore-mediated histamine release. The concentration for 50% of maximal inhibition was 12 nM, and prolonged exposure to the drug was required, with maximal effect observed in 8 to 15 hr. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was reversible (t1/2 for recovery was 16 hr). Dexamethasone blocked the IgE-mediated 45Ca2+ influx and the release of [14C]-arachidonic acid (IC50 of 1 nM and 10 nM respectively). Dexamethasone inhibited the IgE receptor-mediated phosphoinositide breakdown (IC50 of 5 nM). It also decreased arachidonic acid release after A23187 stimulation demonstrating an effect on phospholipase A2. Therefore, exposure of the cells to dexamethasone results in the inhibition of both phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C pathways of arachidonic acid generation.\r"

  ".W": "Cell mediated immunity to nonlethal Plasmodium yoelli 17X (PY17X-NL) was examined in the CBA/CaJ mouse by adoptive transfer of sensitized T lymphocyte subsets. In intact mice, PY17X-NL causes a self-limiting infection with parasitemia levels ranging from 10 to 25% of total red blood cells. Upon recovery, mice are refractory to subsequent challenge with the homologous parasite. In T cell-depleted mice, PY17X-NL infections are extremely virulent and result in death of the host after parasitemia levels reach 50% or higher. The transfer of either Lyt-1 T cells or Lyt-2 T cells from immune animals into normal, naive animals produced accelerated recovery to subsequent infection. However, this adoptive transfer of immunity by either subset was dependent upon the presence of an I-J+, Lyt-null cell in the immune population. T cell deprivation precluded the ability of animals to control blood-stage infections. When T cell-depleted mice were reconstituted with naive, Ig-negative (T cell-enriched) spleen cells, parasitemia levels were controlled and the parasites were eliminated. When T cell-deprived animals were reconstituted with naive Lyt-1+2-, Ig-negative spleen cells, they experienced twofold higher parasitemias of longer duration than mice receiving unfractionated cells. Two of six of these Lyt-1 mice died of fulminant infections, suggesting that the presence of naive Lyt-2 cells enhances the degree of protection. Immune Lyt-2 T cells were highly protective in T cell-depleted animals. Protection by sensitized Lyt-1 T cells correlated with the induction of a monocytosis. On the other hand, protection by Lyt-2T cells occurred in the absence of monocytosis. The possibility that the immunity induced by each T cell subset is mediated by a different effector mechanism is discussed.\r"

Switch regions are composed of tandemly repeated simple sequences. The role of the tandemly repeated structure of switch regions in the switch recombination process is not understood. We mapped eight recombination sites--six in the gamma 1 and two in the gamma 3 tandem arrays. In addition, we obtained molecular clones representing three of the six gamma 1 rearrangements, and determined the nucleotide sequences of the recombination sites in each. In general, the rearrangements are confined to the tandem repeat units, and are not clustered in a particular portion of either the gamma 3 or gamma 1 switch region. Nucleotide sequence analysis of one of the recombinant clones, gamma M35, reveals evidence for a successive switch event wherein a recombination between S mu and S gamma 3 was followed by recombination 57 bp downstream with S gamma 1. gamma 1 sequence data from the molecular clones we obtained, together with similar data from other investigators regarding the gamma 1, gamma 2b, and gamma 2a switch regions, reveals that recombinations tend to occur at homologous positions of the respective gamma-unit repeats, adjacent to the elements AGCT and GGGG found in each. This finding suggests that the cutting and religation step of the recombination process is mediated by a recombinase common to the four gamma-isotypes.\r"

In the present study, we monitored the relationship of c-myc, c-fos, c-fms, and c-sis expression to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced monocytic differentiation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 500 U/ml IFN-gamma arrested cell proliferation after 3 days. Appearance of the monocytic phenotype was manifested within 24 hr of IFN-gamma exposure by: increased nitroblue tetrazolium reduction; increased cell surface expression of the HLA-DR, Mo1, and MY4 antigens; and induction of transcripts for the second component of complement (C2) and tumor necrosis factor. In contrast, c-myc expression decreased as a later event after 72 hr of IFN-gamma exposure, and c-fos transcripts remained undetectable until 5 days of treatment. Furthermore, c-fms RNA and transcripts for the macrophage marker apolipoprotein E were induced only after 7 days. Finally, expression of the c-sis proto-oncogene at the RNA and protein levels remained undetectable after induction with IFN-gamma. These findings would thus suggest that declines in c-myc RNA, as well as induction of c-fos, c-fms, and c-sis expression, are not requisite events in the commitment of HL-60 cells to IFN-gamma-induced monocytic differentiation. Expression of c-fos and c-fms, however, is associated with acquisition of markers associated with maturation to macrophages.\r"

After stimulation with phorbol myristic acetate (PMA) and interleukin 2, essentially normal levels of surface antigen receptor were expressed by the lpr Lyt-2- L3T4- subpopulation but remained undetectable in the corresponding normal immature thymocyte population. We have found near normal T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha and -beta mRNA expression by these lpr cells. The phenotypically comparable Lyt-2- L3T4- subset of normal thymocytes expressed approximately 10-fold less TCR-alpha mRNA than normal lymph node cells and somewhat higher TCR-beta mRNA. After cultivation of this immature thymocyte subpopulation with PMA and interleukin 2, TCR-alpha mRNA levels remained low, and TCR-beta transcripts were found to be subnormal. By using the same culture conditions, the corresponding mRNA levels of the lpr subset tended to resemble those of Lyt-2- L3T4- thymocytes. Fresh and cultured Lyt-2- L3T4- normal thymocytes showed comparably high levels of full-length TCR-gamma transcripts. In contrast, the fresh lpr subset had barely detectable levels of TCR-gamma mRNA. Upon cultivation, however, these levels increased over 200-fold to within the range observed in the Lyt-2- L3T4- thymocyte subset. No induction of the gamma gene was observed in similarly cultured normal lymph node T cells. The lpr cells may therefore correspond to an as yet undefined stage of normal T cell differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Two Lyt-1+, L3T4a+ autoreactive T cell clones specific for self-class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products were established from lymph node cells and spleen cells of C57BL/6J mice, respectively, by different methods. They were stimulated to proliferate in culture in response to I-Ab antigen-bearing syngeneic spleen cells in a class II MHC-restricted manner. This stimulation was inhibited completely by the addition of anti-L3T4a (GK1.5) or anti-I-Ab (3JP) monoclonal antibodies. The autoreactive T cell clones lysed syngeneic I-Ab+ target cells such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) blasts. They also lysed I-A- bystander cells such as Cloudman and B16 melanoma and lymphoid tumor cells in the presence of I-Ab+ stimulator cells but not I-Ad+ cells. This bystander killing was most likely mediated by soluble factors released from the autoreactive T cells in response to I-Ab antigens, because culture supernatants from activated autoreactive T cells inhibited the proliferation of B16 melanoma cells in vitro and also had significant cytolytic activity. Both lymphotoxin and interferon-gamma were released from activated autoreactive T cells, suggesting that these cytotoxic lymphokines were responsible for autoreactive T cell-mediated cytolysis. The finding that the two clones, established independently and by different methods, show self-class II MHC antigen-restricted cytolysis, and bystander cytolysis suggests that these properties are not restricted to a unique population of autoreactive T cells. These results favor the concept that in vivo, autoreactive T cells may express not only regulatory activity in regard to antibody responses, but also anti-tumor activity via bystander cytolysis.\r"

Furthermore, the helper cell clones amplified cytotoxic immune response by peripheral blood lymphocytes against the paraganglioma cells in coculture with the blood lymphocytes and the paraganglioma cells. An autologous T cell line bearing suppressor phenotype, established from a lymph node that had been infiltrated with the paraganglioma tumor cells, in contrast to the helper cells, selectively suppressed the cytotoxic immune response by the blood lymphocytes against the paraganglioma cells in identical coculture. These results, therefore, demonstrate the existence of cell-mediated immunologic regulations of the cytotoxic immune response (concurrent amplification and suppression in the same host) against an autologous human tumor.\r"

Western blot analysis of the antibody showed that its determinant was the alpha 3 (V) chain of type V collagen. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of intact human skin with the antibody produced staining of the dermal blood vessels but not of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). In contrast, both the dermal blood vessels and the DEJ were labeled by the antibody if the skin substrate was first split through the lamina lucida region of the DEJ by incubation in 1 M NaCl solution. Indirect immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the staining pattern found by immunofluorescence and defined the ultrastructural localization of type V collagen in skin. Type V collagen is localized within the DEJ to the lamina lucida region and polar aspects of the basal cell keratinocyte plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the distinct cutaneous manifestations of erythropoietic protoporphyria and porphyria cutanea tarda, the effects of protoporphyrin (PP) and uroporphyrin (URO), the predominant porphyrins in the respective disease, on mast cells were examined. Release of preformed and generated mediators was assessed by the release of radioactivity from cells labeled with [3H]serotonin and [14C]arachidonic acid, respectively. Clinically relevant doses of PP (25-500 ng/ml) and 396-407 nm irradiation (3-16 X 10(2)J/m2) induced maximal net release of preformed mediators of 44.52 +/- 6.6 to 58.01 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SE). In contrast, irradiation in the presence of URO (50-5000 ng/ml) resulted in less than 5% net release. [3H]Serotonin release induced by PP and irradiation was calcium-independent, and was not enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a known activator of protein kinase C. This release was suppressed by catalase, a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, irradiation in the presence of PP, but not in the presence of URO, resulted in perturbation of cell membrane. Irradiation in the presence of PP also resulted in a maximal net release of generated mediators of 9.98 +/- 3.5% (mean +/- SE), whereas similar treatment in the presence of URO induced less than 0.5% net release. These results suggested that the burning, stinging, erythema, and edema experienced by patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria following sun exposure, and the lack of such findings in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, may be explained, at least in part, by the differential effects of PP and URO on mast cells.\r"

There is not, however, any method to quantitate the morphologic changes of dopa-positive melanocytes in the split preparation. This study designed a computed image analyzing system and evaluated the structure of epidermal melanocytes in cafe-au-lait macules with comparison to normally pigmented skin in 5 patients with neurofibromatosis. By this method we were able to delineate the melanocyte structure with melanocyte population and coloration of the macules. We found that the population and structure of melanocytes differ greatly depending on the coloration of the cafe-au-lait macules. The light brown and brown macules showed the normal population of melanocytes with an increase in the area and perimeter of whole cell; the area, perimeter, and diameter of cytoplasm; and the area, length, and breadth of dendrites. In contrast, the dark brown macules revealed a significant increase of the epidermal melanocytes with a decrease in all of these parameters. Thus, the methodologic design presented here may enable a quantitative, two-dimensional analysis of melanocyte structure at the light microscopic level in the normal skin and in various pigmentary disorders.\r"

In sex-linked recessive tyrosinase-positive albinism, sal, melanocytes in regenerating feathers and neural tube-derived cultures contained morphologically normal and abnormal premelanosomes. Tyrosinase was localized primarily to the abnormal premelanosomes and probably not to the normal ones. The cells possessed, in addition, vacuoles with membranous inclusions, located in the dendrites, and capped by dopa-positive vesicles (capping vesicles). Acid phosphatase colocalized with tyrosinase in the abnormal premelanosomes and capping vesicles. Tyrosinase activity in extracts of cultured sal melanocytes equalled that of e+ control melanocytes. A tyrosinase antiserum, raised against hamster tyrosinase (Pomerantz), precipitated 2 proteins, 68 kD and 82 kD, which had a precursor-product relationship. The amount of immunoprecipitate was the same in sal and control extracts, but in sal extracts the lower-molecular-weight protein was twice as abundant as the higher-molecular-weight protein. Melanocytes in regenerating feathers from an autosomal recessive, tyrosinase-negative albino, ca, also contained morphologically normal and abnormal premelanosomes. In culture, ca melanocytes had no formal premelanosomes but only dopa-negative multivesicular bodies with wispy filamentous material. Tyrosinase activity and immunoprecipitable tyrosinase were absent. These results suggest that: the tyrosinase-positive albino, sal, has an aberration in both its tyrosinase and acid phosphatase profiles and the tyrosinase-negative albino, ca, lacks functionally and antigenically normal tyrosinase.\r"

Whereas the latter lesions demonstrated intact basement membranes as evidenced by extracellular laminin and type IV collagen immunoreactivity and the presence of an unusually thickened basal lamina, desmoplastic basal cell carcinomas showed large defects and absences in basal lamina and basement membrane immunoreactivity. Intense tumor cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for type IV collagenase was present in 13 of 15 cases of desmoplastic basal cell but absent in the superficial and nodular-ulcerative varieties. Whereas explant cultures of all the types of basal cell carcinoma studied gave rise to high levels of interstitial (type I) collagenase activity in conditioned media, only the desmoplastic variety exhibited high type IV collagenase activity. These findings suggest that the mechanisms by which the desmoplastic and the common varieties of basal cell carcinoma infiltrate host tissues may be fundamentally different.\r"

These agents enhanced T-cell adhesion in a manner similar to that previously observed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (UVEC). Moreover, phorbol ester stimulation of T cells enhanced T-cell adhesion to both DMVEC and UVEC. Unstimulated and phorbol ester-enhanced T-cell adhesion to both DMVEC and UVEC was strongly inhibited by monoclonal antibody (Mab) 60.3 against the surface membrane CDw18 glycoprotein complex. In contrast, Mab 60.3 had a much weaker inhibitory effect on the binding enhancement due to IL-1, LPS, or IFN-gamma, suggesting that these agents may enhance adhesion by a mechanism at least partially independent of CDw18. These observations suggest that DMVEC behave in a similar fashion to UVEC in T-cell adhesion studies, and support previous conclusions that modulation of lymphocyte endothelial cell adhesion by cytokines, bacterial products, and phorbol esters may be relevant to lymphocyte adhesion and migration in vivo.\r"

The sensitivity of the test for diagnosing tuberculous meningitis was 1 and specificity, 0.99. The enzyme activity, as well as progression of the disease, was studied in 32 patients with tuberculous meningitis. A significant rise in levels of enzyme was observed during the first 10 days of therapy, was followed by a gradual decline, and reached normal values after three to four months of treatment. Two patients showed substantial increases that coincided with the development of complications. The test proved to be a simple and reliable method for early diagnosis and follow-up of tuberculous meningitis.\r"

The reaction is amplified by using biotinylated antibody to rabbit IgG and 125I-labeled avidin. The assay has a sensitivity of 20 ng/ml and shows less than 5% cross-reactivity with six other mycobacteria. We studied patients with untreated tuberculous meningitis, patients with treated tuberculous meningitis, patients with nonbacterial meningitis, and patients with bacterial meningitis. Antigen was detectable in two of 56 control samples (40 ng/ml). Hence, samples with greater than or equal to 80 ng of antigen/ml were considered positive. In patients with untreated tuberculous meningitis, antigen levels ranged from 20 to 10,000 ng/ml, and 15 (79%) of 19 samples were positive. In the treated group, only two (10%) of 17 samples were positive. This test promises to be a rapid adjunct in the early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.\r"

Results after intravenous injections of TSST-1 given to both types of rabbits indicated that specific pathogen-free rabbits were resistant to the lethal effects observed in conventional rabbits. Lethality could be prevented by simultaneous administration of polymyxin B, and analysis of serum before and after dosing confirmed that dosing with TSST-1 resulted in circulating endotoxin. Analysis of sera from humans with TSS showed that endotoxin was present in acute-phase sera but not in convalescent-phase sera. These observations suggest that endogenous endotoxin contributes to rabbit susceptibility to TSST-1 and may play a role in human TSS.\r"

Because this growth factor also stimulated thymocyte proliferation, we further investigated the mesenchymal target cell specificity of this factor. We now report that granulomas also secrete material that promotes growth of aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells. We found that the activities that stimulate fibroblast and smooth muscle cell growth share similar physicochemical properties (Mr, 30-40 kilodaltons [kDa]; pI, approximately 6.5), a result suggesting that they are the same or related molecules. In contrast, fractions (Mr, less than 10 kDa; pI, 6.7-7.5) that maximally stimulated endothelial cells had minimal or no effects on the other two cell types. We postulate that soluble granuloma products might also stimulate in vivo proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and contribute to the pathology of the intrahepatic vessels in schistosomiasis.\r"

Imipenem was hydrolyzed very slowly (kcat, 1/min) and induced beta-lactamase synthesis strongly. Its minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) reflected this behavior, being equal (1-2 micrograms/ml) for enzyme-inducible strains and their stably derepressed mutants. Mutants that had basal (i.e., minimal and uninducible) enzyme production were eight- to 16-fold more susceptible to imipenem than were inducible or stably derepressed strains. Carbenicillin was stable to hydrolysis (kcat, less than 0.1/min) and induced weakly at low concentrations. Consequently its MICs were equal for beta-lactamase-inducible strains and for their basal mutants. Stable beta-lactamase derepression generally did not increase resistance to carbenicillin significantly. Azlocillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone were labile to hydrolysis (kcat, 12-297/min) but induced poorly. Consequently their MICs for enzyme-inducible strains equaled those for basal mutants but were elevated for derepressed mutants.\r"

In contrast, survival was not improved with either azlocillin alone at all doses studied or lower doses of tobramycin alone.

Ciprofloxacin was rapidly absorbed, and effective levels persisted for 1-4 hr relative to the dose administered.

  ".W": "The historical development of carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumors is reviewed. Most work has been done with the polycyclic hydrocarbon dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Huggins was the first to describe a protocol for the routine production of DMBA-induced mammary tumors and demonstrated their ovarian dependency. Pearson found that DMBA-induced tumors could not grow during estrogen administration in hypophysectomized rats, and it was subsequently shown that estrogen-stimulated prolactin release is responsible for tumor growth. The antiestrogen tamoxifen has been used in the treatment of breast cancer and has been studied extensively in the DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinoma model. The complexities of tamoxifen's pharmacology in vivo suggested that the development of estrogen-responsive systems in vitro might facilitate an understanding of tamoxifen's mode of action. The description of estrogen-stimulated prolactin synthesis by primary culture of pituitary gland cells provided an opportunity to study the structure-activity relationships of antiestrogens. A model (\"crocodile model\") to describe the interaction of estrogens and antiestrogens is proposed. An estrogen will permit the conformation change in the receptor that is necessary to translate into prolactin synthesis. An antiestrogen wedges into the binding site on the receptor to prevent changes in protein conformation. As a result prolactin synthesis is inhibited. An extensive study of structure-activity relationships has been used to describe the nature of the ligand binding site of the estrogen receptor. The model can be used to predict the pharmacology of new agents.\r"

  ".W": "Thyrotropin (TSH) secretion is regulated primarily by thyroid hormones and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Normally, TSH secretion is exquisitely sensitive to small increases and decreases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations when they occur as a result of alterations in thyroid secretion. Serum TSH responses to TRH are altered by even smaller decreases and increases in serum thyroid hormone concentrations. This sensitivity explains the value of measurements of basal serum TSH concentrations and serum TSH responses to TRH in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively. How TRH secretion is regulated is unknown, but the direct inhibitory effect of thyroid hormones on the thyrotrophs minimizes the stimulatory effect of any chronic changes in TRH secretion that may occur. In patients with nonthyroid illness, however, the normal relationships between serum thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations and TSH secretion are altered. Slightly or moderately ill patients have decreases in extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production that are not followed by an increase in TSH secretion, although the sensitivity of the thyrotrophs to further reduction or to an increase in triiodothyronine concentration is maintained. More severe illness may result in impaired TSH secretion and thus in decreased thyroidal as well as decreased extrathyroidal thyroid hormone production. These alterations in thyrotroph sensitivity and secretion, so that TSH secretion is not increased when extrathyroidal triiodothyronine production is decreased and thyroid secretion is decreased in more severe illness, suggest that decreased thyroid hormone production is a beneficial adaptation to nonthyroid illness.\r"

  ".W": "Transsphenoidal microsurgery has been shown to be effective in the management of human growth hormone (hGH)-secreting pituitary adenomas. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness of hGH dynamic testing (oral glucose tolerance, insulin hypoglycemia, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test) in evaluating the completeness of removal of the adenomas. In patients with acromegaly, serum insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels are known to correlate with the activity of the disease. We studied the dynamics of hGH secretion in 43 patients with hGH-secreting adenomas 2 to 3 months after surgery. In addition, serum IGF-I levels were recently measured in frozen sera obtained from these patients at the time of dynamic testing. Of the 43 patients undergoing surgery, 19 had normal basal hGH levels as well as dynamics (group I). Two additional patients had low or undetectable hGH levels and were hypopituitary (group II). These 21 patients were considered cured and had no evidence for recurrence of their disease during a mean follow-up period of 97 months. Serum IGF-I levels were normal in 19 (group I) and low in the remaining two patients (group II). Nine additional patients had normal basal hGH levels but abnormal dynamics of secretion (group III). Serum IGF-I levels were normal postoperatively in seven of eight patients tested in this group. During the follow-up period in these nine patients (group III), biochemical and clinical recurrence of acromegaly developed in five. The remaining 13 patients had persistent elevation of basal hGH levels, and all samples tested (n = 8) had elevated IGF-I levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Erythropoietin titers measured by radioimmunoassay in 34 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 25 patients with sickle cell anemia (58 separate samples), and 28 patients with erythroid hypoplasia caused by hematologic malignancies were compared with those in the control group of patients with uncomplicated anemias and found not to differ significantly from titers in this group. Erythropoietin titers measured by bioassay in 12 patients with aplastic anemia also fell within the range of those in the control group. Consequently, erythropoietin titers in these anemias appear to be determined primarily by the degree of anemia and not by any specific effect of these illnesses on the production of erythropoietin.\r"

  ".W": "Previous organ culture investigations into the pathogenesis of renal cyst formation have demonstrated that glucocorticoid-induced proximal tubular cyst formation is associated with increases in renal sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase) activity. To explore the relationship between cyst production and transport enzyme induction, we examined the effects of the potent inducer of Na-K-ATPase activity, L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), on renal tubular morphologic and enzymatic development in murine metanephric organ culture. The addition of T3 (2 X 10(-8) mol/L) to completely characterized, serum-free growth medium produced striking proximal tubular cystic abnormalities. Frank cyst development was preceded by ultrastructural alterations consisting of basolateral intercellular spreading, which increased with progressive tubular dilation. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated no abnormalities of tubular cyst wall basal laminae, and immunohistologic staining with affinity-purified antibodies to the basal lamina glycoproteins fibronectin, laminin, and entactin, revealed no differences between cystic and control tissue. With use of an enzyme-linked kinetic microassay, T3-induced cystic organ culture explants (CY) showed significant increases in Na-K-ATPase when compared with controls from 72 to 120 hours of organ culture incubation. The initial differences in CY Na-K-ATPase occurred contemporaneously with the earliest ultrastructural evidence of cyst formation, and subsequent increases paralleled progressive tubular cyst formation. Tubular cyst formation in CY could be largely prevented by daily incubation of explants with ouabain, 0.2 mmol/L (final concentration) for 120 minutes without deleterious effects on overall metanephric development. We conclude that T3 induces proximal tubular cyst formation in metanephric organ culture, and that T3-induced increases in Na-K-ATPase have a primary role in the pathogenesis of tubular cyst formation in this model system.\r"

Total lung elastin content in the amiodarone-treated animals was 32% greater than in controls (P less than 0.05) 2 weeks after insufflation of the agent. Furthermore, the time course of elastin synthesis in this experimental model was similar to that observed in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters. Increases in elastin may therefore be a common feature of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and may contribute to the altered lung mechanics seen in this disease.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the protein and trace metal metabolism of severely protein-malnourished guinea pigs given exogenous interleukin 1 in the postabsorptive state or while concomitantly receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Protein-depleted guinea pigs in the postabsorptive state failed to exhibit fever, granulocytosis, accelerated amino acid oxidation, or an acute-phase protein response after administration of interleukin 1 or endotoxin. However, a reduction in the serum concentration of zinc (P less than 0.05) and iron (P less than 0.05) was observed in the guinea pigs given interleukin 1, but not in those given endotoxin. The short-term (1 day) administration of TPN restored positive leucine balance (P less than 0.001) and reduced leucine release from protein breakdown (P less than 0.001). No other differences in the protein metabolism or trace metal response to interleukin 1 were observed as a result of short-term TPN feeding. Body temperatures of these malnourished guinea pigs given interleukin 1 and TPN became febrile or hypothermic depending on initial body temperatures. It is concluded that an attenuated capacity to synthesize interleukin 1 and a failure to mount an appropriate acute-phase protein response to exogenously administered interleukin 1 exist in this protein-malnourished animal model. Furthermore, this diminished protein response appears to be independent of short-term substrate provision because TPN for 1 day was unable to restore the full effects of the acute-phase response as mediated by interleukin 1.\r"

The reduction of anxiety lasts for days, weeks, or longer--well beyond the persistence of carbon dioxide in the body. The effects are explicable on the hypothesis that free-floating anxiety is anxiety conditioned to continuously present sources of stimulation, such as background noise or the awareness of space or time, and that the anxiety response habit is weakened when the anxiety is inhibited by the competition of responses that carbon dioxide induces. More recently, it has become apparent that inhalations of carbon dioxide, applied in a different manner, are effective in overcoming maladaptive anxiety responses to specific stimuli, e.g., social stimuli. The substance is also proving to be a valuable resource in the treatment of the common variety of panic attacks.\r"

Mouse brain microvessel endothelial cells were grown to confluence on a nitrocellulose filter. The permeability of the endothelium to Evan's blue dye (EBD) (molecular weight 960) and fluoresceinated dextran (FITC-D) (molecular weight 20,000), both polar molecules, was assessed before and after the exposure of the endothelium to cationic ferritin (CF) or native ferritin (NF). The use of CF resulted in a significant increase in permeability of the endothelium to EBD compared to NF. This result indicates that ablation of endothelial surface anionic charge enhances endothelial transport of a small, polar-charged molecule. Cationic ferritin did not increase the permeability of FITC-D compared to NF. This negative result is not surprising because FITC-D differs from EBD in terms of charge and solubility as well as in size. The electrical resistance of the endothelial cell layer after the application of CF was unchanged from baseline values suggesting a transcellular rather than a paracellular route of the EBD leakage.\r"

To investigate their composition and possible relationship to the neuronal cytoskeleton, we employed immunocytochemistry and immunoelectronmicroscopy by using antisera to cytoskeletal proteins. The presence of actin, alpha-actinin, vinculin and tropomyosin was demonstrated diffusely throughout the Hirano body. The presence of these proteins supports the contention that Hirano bodies are derived from an abnormal organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton. The staining of Hirano bodies with fluorescent labelled phalloidin, a probe with a unique affinity for F-actin, indicates that the actin in Hirano bodies is in the F-state. Results of high voltage electron microscopy on 1.0 and 0.5 micron sections confirm the purely filamentous nature of Hirano bodies. These findings suggest that the mechanism of formation of Hirano bodies is different from that of the neurofibrillary tangle, another characteristic intraneuronal inclusion seen in Alzheimer patients.\r"

Regional mean cerebral blood flow, regional gray-matter flow, and relative gray-matter weight was determined for six regions of interest.

Twenty patients were treated. The protocol called for the delivery of 5-FU infusion (1,000 mg/m2/d X 4 d) days 1 to 4 and 29 to 32 with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) day 1 and 29 sandwiched around external beam radiation (3,000 cGy over 3 weeks). Mitomycin C (10 mg/m2) day 57 was administered with bleomycin infusion (20 U/d X 4 d) days 57 to 60 and 78 to 81. A radiation boost of 2,000 cGy was administered 200 cGy/d days 99 to 103 and 106 to 110. Clinical pulmonary toxicity forced withdrawal of bleomycin and mitomycin C in the last four patients treated; two further courses of 5-FU-cisplatin were administered instead. The median measurement of the 20 esophageal lesions by barium swallow was 7 cm. Four patients underwent salvage surgery to prevent life-threatening aspiration pneumonia. The median survival for the 20 patients is 22 months, with a range from 6 to 39+ months. The six patients clinically without cancer are alive 22+ to 39+ months (median, 35+ months). Three patients died manifesting only local (infield) recurrence; five died manifesting only distant recurrence; and five developed local and distant recurrence. While the toxicity of the four drug regimen as administered was prohibitive, the survival and quality of survival is superior to the regimen previously used, which routinely used surgery after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation.\r"

Two groups of dogs were studied to determine if renal excretion of mannitol was altered in the presence of furosemide. No significant difference in excretion was noted between the two groups. Fifteen animals were used in other studies to identify the most advantageous sequence of administration of furosemide and mannitol. Infusion of mannitol followed by furosemide 15 minutes later resulted in the most profound and sustained ICP reduction. The effect on ICP reduction of varying the mannitol dose was observed in studies using single doses of 0.5 gm/kg, 0.75 gm/kg, and 1 gm/kg. The larger mannitol dose, resulting in a greater blood-brain osmotic gradient, proved to be the most efficacious in ICP reduction. A further 15 animals were used in investigations to determine whether changing the rate of delivery of the most effective mannitol dose (1 gm/kg) influenced resultant ICP reduction. The results indicated that rapid administration (2 ml/kg/min) produced higher peak serum concentrations of mannitol and more profound lowering of ICP than the same dose delivered at slower rates.\r"

This contrasted with [111In]T101 where there was prolonged retention of activity in these organs and excellent uptake in skin tumors, erythroderma, and lymph nodes. The study showed that [131I]T101 was suboptimal for imaging CTCL patients and demonstrates that the isotope or labeling method can dramatically alter the apparent biodistribution and tumor targeting of a given monoclonal antibody.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the significance of 67Ga localization in the thymus of children, 142 67Ga photoscans from 45 children with various tumors were studied. Sixty-nine photoscans were taken for 17 cases of lymphoma, 73 photoscans were made for 28 cases of nonlymphoid tumors. Thymic localization of 67Ga was positive in 16 (36%) of the 45 patients and in 30 (21%) of the 142 photoscans. Positive thymus scans were seen in five (29%) of the 17 cases of lymphoma and 11 (39%) of the 28 solid tumors. The positive incidence was highest (90%) in ages 1-2 yr old. Of the eight grade 2 (strong positive) patients, the thymus in one case of Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed as malignant and the other seven solid tumor cases were nonmalignant. Most of the latter seven cases became positive after beginning of treatment (surgery and/or chemotherapy). Although the precise mechanism is not well understood, thymic localization of 67Ga may represent immunologic response to tumors, especially in infants with nonlymphoid neoplasms.\r"

In the present series, [131]MIBG total-body scintigraphy was used for detection of neuroblastoma in 47 patients and 47 cases of other neural crest tumors. The method was found to be as reliable in neuroblastoma (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%), as it is in pheochromocytoma. Although other neural crest tumors may concentrate [131I]MIBG, this is not a consistent finding; however, it is useful to investigate which tumors do, as this may provide an alternative treatment modality for some patients. Although followup is still very short, preliminary results of therapeutic use of [131I] MIBG in 21 patients indicate that this treatment modality may be effective in neuroblastoma and malignant pheochromocytoma.\r"

Normal bones show no uptake of [131I]MIBG and the joints are seen as photon-deficient areas surrounded by background muscle activity. Discrete concentrations of radioactivity in bone are often seen in patients with malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Bone marrow involvement in neuroblastoma may be indicated by diffuse uptake of [131I]MIBG or focal accumulation at the metaphyses. Uncommonly, bone involvement may not be displayed by the [131I]MIBG images. Since conventional bone scanning agents may also fail to detect these tumors, skeletal scintigraphy with both [131I]MIBG and [99mTc]MDP is necessary to reliably stage malignant pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma.\r"

  ".W": "N-isopropyl p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) demonstrates a high affinity for lung and brain during the first pass following intravenous injection. Its high brain affinity has been used to advantage for cerebral perfusion imaging, but the effects of drugs on IMP distribution could affect its utility. In this study, we determined the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the MAO inhibitors deprenyl and phenelzine on the biodistribution of IMP. We first determined the effect of loading dose and anesthesia on the biodistribution of IMP. In rats, biodistribution was not dependent on loading dose between 0.1 and 1.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia with thiopental and chloral hydrate depressed lung and brain IMP uptake. In rats, preloading doses of imipramine depressed lung uptake but did not result in increased brain IMP uptake; postloading doses of imipramine did not release IMP from the lung. In rabbits, simultaneous or postloading doses of imipramine resulted in release of IMP from the lung with an increase in brain activity. Both mixed A and B MAO inhibitors (phenelzine) and B selective MAO inhibitors (deprenyl) did not affect IMP distribution in rats. Based on the action of imipramine on IMP uptake and clearance in the lung, we postulate that IMP uptake and metabolism within the lung is related to the mixed function oxidase (MFO) system. As the lung is rich in the MFO system in humans, we would also predict from this study that IMP distribution in patients under antidepressant therapy would not be affected by either tricyclic or MAO inhibitor agents apart from the effect of these drugs on cerebral perfusion.\r"

Rats fed a glycine-and serine-free L-amino acid diet were injected daily with saline or varying doses of NaB. Growth was monitored for 4 d, after which time rats were killed and livers were assayed for glycine, serine, benzoyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA ligase and glycine benzoyl-CoA transferase. In control animals, liver glycine and serine concentrations were 2.18 and 1.63 mumol/g wet wt, respectively; benzoyl-CoA was not detectable. In rats injected with 600 mg NaB/kg body wt per day, liver glycine and serine concentrations decreased to 68 and 78% of control values, respectively, and benzoyl-CoA accumulated (0.52 mumol/g wet wt). As the dose of NaB was increased, liver benzoyl-CoA concentration increased, and growth of the rats was markedly impaired. The activities of benzoyl-CoA ligase and glycine benzoyl-CoA transferase were unchanged after NaB treatment. In a second experiment, rats were treated with growth-impairing doses of NaB. When the diet was supplemented with serine and glycine, growth was normalized, liver glycine and serine concentrations returned to control levels, and benzoyl-CoA accumulation was markedly diminished. These results suggest that glycine availability limits maximum hippurate synthesis in vivo.\r"

The infants were stratified into two groups: infants with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 g and gestational age less than or equal to 34 weeks, and infants with birth weight greater than 1500 g and receiving intensive care and assisted ventilation. Forty-three infants in group 1 and 25 in group 2 were given gammaglobulin at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/wk, for 1 month in group 1 and during intensive care in group 2. Forty infants in group 1 and 25 in group 2 served as controls. Serum total IgG and group B streptococcus-, Escherichia coli-, and CMV-specific IgG levels similar to those in adult controls were observed in the treated infants 2 hours after gammaglobulin administration. In the treated infants in group 1, the incidence of infection was 51%, and of septicemia 5%; in the controls the incidence of infection was 77% (P less than 0.02), and of septicemia 20% (P less than 0.05). Infection was the main cause of death in one treated and six control infants in group 1 (P less than 0.04). In the infants with birth weight greater than 1500 g receiving intensive care and assisted ventilation, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of infection or septicemia in treated and control infants. No side effects were observed after intravenous gammaglobulin administration. These data show that intravenously administered gammaglobulin is both safe and effective for prophylaxis of infection in preterm very low birth weight infants.\r"

Significantly lower referral rates were found for the second-year residents than the third-year residents. Possible explanations for this finding included: differences in approach to case management, lack of referral experience by second-year residents, and differences in case mix. Although no explicit protocol existed for the distribution of patients to the residents, differences in case mix and patient age between the patients seen by the two groups of residents accounted for the difference in referral rates. This difference implies that patient distribution in graduate training programs may not be random as commonly thought.\r"

With the recent development of instrumentation for indirect calorimetric measurements, questions have been raised concerning the validity and accuracy of the early equations. Because metabolic rate decreases during the course of wound healing, we attempted to determine the magnitude of hypermetabolism and the accuracy of the Curreri formula in patients with various wound sizes. Twenty-eight patients with a mean initial burn size of 29% body surface area (BSA) had measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE) at regular intervals during their postburn course. Concomitantly, basal energy expenditure (BEE) was calculated from the Harris-Benedict equation; and the predicted energy needs were calculated using the Curreri formula adjusted for current wound size (ACEE). Three significantly different burn size (%BSA) groups were identified: Group 1, 1-10%; Group 2, 11-30%; and Group 3, 31-60% BSA. The measured REE was 27, 35, and 50% greater than the BEE in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p less than 0.001). The ACEE underestimated REE by 7% in Group 1, and overestimated REE by 13 and 35% in Groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.001). Resting energy expenditure should be measured at regular intervals in individuals with open burn wounds greater than 10% BSA in order to adjust nutritional support appropriately.\r"

To extend these studies, we determined the influence of protein malnutrition and endotoxemia on bacterial translocation in burned (25% TBSA) and unburned mice. The results of these experiments documented that protein malnutrition did not promote bacterial translocation from the gut in either burned or unburned animals, although it did disrupt the normal indigenous gut flora. In contrast, a nonlethal dose of endotoxin (IP) promoted bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes in burned and unburned mice, but only in burned mice did the bacteria translocate from the gut to other systemic organs (p less than 0.01). Furthermore, the mortality rate of mice receiving only endotoxin or burn was less than 10%, while the combination of endotoxin plus a thermal injury increased the mortality rate to 100% (p less than 0.01). These studies support the concept that bacteria may translocate from the gut to other organs and be a potential source of lethal infections after thermal injury.\r"

  ".W": "The capability of exogenous recombinant Interleukin 2 (rIL2) to increase expression of the IL2 receptor (IL2R), and to augment the in vitro proliferative response of lymphocytes from immunosuppressed burned patients (5-80% full-thickness burns) was examined. Throughout the postburn period the percentage of IL2R-bearing cells in Concanavalin A-activated cultures of patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was measured by direct immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-IL2R antibodies. Mitogen-induced IL2R expression was decreased by 40-90% in cultures of patients' PBMC, parallel to their reduced alloreactivity. During this period of immunosuppression supplementation of the mitogen-activated cultures with recombinant IL2 (20 U/ml) significantly increased the number of IL2R-expressing cells in all patients studied. However, IL2-induced enhancement of blastogenesis in the MLR was observed only with the patients who, in mitogen-activated cultures, sustained numbers of IL2R-endowed cells at least 50% of their baseline (the level within the first 24 hours postburn). Also, unstimulated PBMC of the same responding patients demonstrated a restoration of proliferation in the presence of rIL2. These patients were survivors. Thus the proliferative response correlated well with the number of Con A- but not rIL2-induced IL2R-expressing cells. These results suggest that in burned patients, IL2 up-regulates its receptors, but they may represent low-affinity nonfunctional receptors. Thus thermal injury appears to affect expression of functional (high-affinity) receptors.\r"

Patients with burns greater than 50% of the total body surface area (TBSA) initially have poor gastrointestinal function, making it difficult to deliver sufficient enteral calories to meet nutritional requirements. Controversy has developed over whether to supplement oral alimentation with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) early in their treatment. This study randomly assigned 28 patients with burns greater than 50% TBSA to receive TPN supplementation or no TPN supplementation in the first 10 days postburn. Patients receiving TPN supplementation had significantly lower T-cell helper-to-suppressor cell ratios than the unsupplemented group. However, there was no difference in mortality between the groups (eight in each). All patients who died developed hepatomegaly associated with fatty infiltration cholestasis and antemortem liver function abnormalities, indicating that this syndrome is the result of burn injury itself, not TPN.\r"

Malnourished patients had greater operative morbidity, operative mortality and days of intensive care than their nutritionally normal counterparts. Kaplan-Meier survival plots showed a tendency to early death of disease in the malnourished patients with convergence of survival rates after 36 months. Of the malnourished patients 7 had extensive nutritional support, and 6 had no parenteral and minimal enteral or oral support. Operative morbidity and mortality rates were higher in the nutritionally supported than in the unsupported groups. Nutritional support in the immediate perioperative period probably does little to alter operative complications.\r"

Sperm quantity had stronger correlations with testicular size than did sperm quality, although both were impaired in testes smaller than 14 ml. It is concluded that the size of the testis bears a direct correlation with testicular function and, thus, it can be helpful to assess rapidly andrological status during the initial physical examination.\r"

Of the 10 patients 7 had sperm concentrations less than 10 million per cc. Endocrine abnormalities occurred in 10 patients, the most common of which were elevations in serum human chorionic gonadotropin and estradiol, and a relative decrease in follicle-stimulating hormone. Three patients who presented with subfertile semen analyses were treated with orchiectomy alone. Repeat semen analyses 4 to 12 months after orchiectomy showed improvement in spermatogenesis and 2 patients achieved a normal semen analysis. Endocrine abnormalities and defective spermatogenesis are common in patients with testicular tumors. These abnormalities precede orchiectomy and imply that a primary germ cell defect exists in these patients.\r"

Skeletal uptake determinations were done in 29 patients with prostatic cancer (17 with osseous metastases) who were evaluated at 3 to 6-month intervals. Group 1 consisted of patients who responded to therapy and achieved remission, group 2 included patients with relapse or progressive disease, group 3 consisted of those with metastases who were in remission for longer than 6 months and group 4 included those without evidence of any bony metastases. The baseline mean +/- standard deviation 24-hour skeletal uptake values were 46.1 +/- 12.0 per cent in group 1, 34.3 +/- 13.9 per cent in group 2, 27.0 +/- 5.9 per cent in group 3 and 28.9 +/- 5.5 per cent in group 4.

Various irrigating agents, including ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and other calcium-chelating substances, were tested at different concentrations and pH values. EDTA was the most effective agent in dissolving calcium oxalate calculi. When EDTA was used, the rate of dissolution depended on both concentration and pH. At a pH of 7.5 or 10.0, the rate of dissolution increased progressively with the EDTA concentration. At each concentration tested, dissolution was faster at a pH of 10.0 than at a pH of 7.5. Calculated rate constants were extrapolated to determine whether in vivo irrigation with EDTA solutions is clinically practical. Even at an EDTA concentration of 0.03 M at a pH of 7.5, a two mm. calculus could be dissolved within 48 hr. Although dissolution of calcium oxalate calculi is not a practical first-line treatment, it might be a useful adjunct to percutaneous stone removal or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

Recombinant gamma-interferon was the most effective of three types of interferon. Combined treatment with recombinant gamma-interferon and some anticancer drugs inhibited the cell growth in both cell lines more than treatment with each drug alone. Treatment with recombinant gamma-interferon and cisplatinum or 5-fluorouracil following a 24-hour incubation with the interferon was more effective than when interferon and the drug were given simultaneously. Treatment using doxorubicin, cisplatinum, or vinblastine with recombinant gamma-interferon synergistically inhibited colony formation in 11 of the 16 renal cell carcinomas that showed clonal growth. Our results suggest that treatment with anticancer drugs in combination with recombinant gamma-interferon is effective for renal cell carcinoma.\r"

To determine the contribution of leukocytes to endothelial cell loss, 111In-labeled, cultured canine jugular venous endothelial cells were grown to confluence on fibronectin-coated polyester elastomer tubes measuring 4 mm inner diameter and 30 mm in length. Autogenous cell-lined tubes were implanted as bilateral carotid replacement grafts in six dogs made leukopenic by cyclophosphamide. Similar unilateral grafts were placed in 12 control dogs. Grafts were removed and perfusion-fixed from six control animals after 2 hours of in vivo arterial perfusion and from the other six animals after 6 hours of perfusion. One graft was removed and perfusion-fixed from each leukopenic animal after 2 hours of implantation and the other after 6 hours. Attachment of endothelial cells to the grafts was measured by indium-labeling technique. Retention of endothelium on grafts removed after 2 hours was measured by planimetric counting with scanning electron microscopy and on those removed after 6 hours by radioisotope quantification. Endothelial cell retention after 2 hours was 37.6% +/- 27.0% in control dogs and 97.0% +/- 3.4% in leukopenic animals (p less than 0.0007). After 6 hours retention was 35.9% +/- 23.2% in control animals and 86.5% +/- 6.0% in leukopenic animals (p less than 0.0009). Leukocyte surface activity was present in less than 1% of the leukopenic dogs compared with 8.5% of the other in vivo midgrafts after 2 hours. These results suggest that leukocytes play a significant role in the loss of seeded endothelium from vascular prostheses.\r"

These grafts differed only in circumferential compliance: they were 100% (compliant) vs. 40% (stiff) as compliant as the host artery. Their flow surfaces were equivalent, as determined by physicochemical measurements and scanning electron microscopy; both lacked viable cells, as determined by in vitro cell culture. In 14 dogs, eight stiff and two compliant grafts became occluded within 3 months, the latter doing so within 24 hours after their contralateral counterparts. Cumulative patencies were 85% and 37% for compliant and stiff grafts, respectively (p less than 0.05) and 100% and 43%, excluding the two dogs with bilateral graft failures (p less than 0.01). We conclude that even with near optimal flow surfaces, compliance mismatch is deleterious to graft patency.\r"

These effects are synergized by heparin. In vivo re-endothelialization of blood-contacting biomaterials may be enhanced by bonding ECGF and heparin to prosthetic surfaces. Long woven Dacron (24 mm) and woven PDS vascular prostheses were treated first with human plasma fibronectin (10 micrograms/cm2). Porcine sodium heparin (20 micrograms/cm2) was added by means of fibronectin's heparin affinity. Pure 125I-ECGF (95% alpha, 5% beta; 1 ng/cm2) was next fixed by the heparin affinity of ECGF and followed by a second heparin layer (20 micrograms/cm2) to synergize with and stabilize ECGF. 125I-ECGF adherences were determined by scintillation counts. Attachment efficiency averaged 25%. Prostheses were interposed into rabbit aortas and harvested in triplicate from 0 to 30 days to establish in vivo washout curves. After explantation, residual 125I-ECGF was eluted from prostheses, and intact ECGF was identified by SDS gel electrophoresis. Similarly prepared but nonradioiodinated Dacron and PDS prostheses were explanted after 7 days and their ECGF eluted off for in vitro activity documentation. This ECGF retained its mitogenic properties, causing a 1000% to 1200% increase in 3H-thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in test murine LE-II cells. Fibronectin-heparin-ECGF fixation to blood-contacting biomaterials may enhance spontaneous re-endothelialization and/or hasten the confluence of transplanted endothelial cells.\r"

By classifying each admission into a baseline diagnosis related group (DRG) (after first excluding all diagnoses of nosocomial infection) and a final DRG (after including these diagnoses), we found that only 5% to 18% of nosocomial infections would have caused the admission to be reclassified to a higher-paying DRG, depending on the extent to which physicians recorded nosocomial infection diagnoses in patients' medical records. The extra payment from the reclassification, averaged over all nosocomial infections, would have been no more than $93 per infection (in 1985 reimbursement rates), constituting only 5% of the hospitals' costs for treating these infections. Thus, at least 95% of the cost savings obtained from preventing nosocomial infections represents financial gains to the hospital.\r"

Thirty-five guinea pigs underwent both catheter gastrostomy and jugular vein catheterization. On postoperative day 8, burned animals [30% total body surface area (TBSA)] were divided into an intragastrically (ig) fed group (N = 14) and a parenterally (iv) fed group (N = 14). Animals in each group received 175 kcal/kg/day with a solution of identical nutrient value beginning 2 hr after burn. The body weight change until postburn day (PBD) 8 and the average nitrogen balance were significantly better in the ig group than in the iv group. Values were also higher for the iv group than for the ig group in the early postburn period for urinary vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) (p less than 0.05), plasma cortisol (p less than 0.05), and plasma glucagon (p less than 0.05). Also, the iv group showed reduced mucosal weight and thickness compared to the ig group on PBD 1 (p less than 0.02). There were significant negative correlations between VMA excretion and body weight change, and between plasma cortisol and jejunal mucosal structure (thickness and weight). These findings suggest that immediate postburn enteral nutrition can provide better nutritional support than parenteral nutrition through the maintenance of gut mucosal integrity and the prevention of increased secretion of catabolic hormones.\r"

Male Fischer 344 rats were studied in an analytical respiration calorimeter. Normal unoperated rats, aseptically catheterized orally fed rats from postoperative day 1 to 7, and TPN rats were studied. Orally fed catheterized rats had weight loss, negative nitrogen balance, negative energy balance, elevated REE, and normal AEE during the first 4 postoperative days. Their weight gain, positive nitrogen balance, AEE, and REE were almost identical to those of normal rats over postoperative days 5 through 7. REE and AEE in TPN rats were similar to values in normal rats.

  ".W": "The relative importance of three nutritional variables, nonprotein energy level, glucose-lipid calorie distribution and amino acid nitrogen level, in contributing to the steatosis that develops during a short course of parenteral nutrition was studied in intravenously fed rats. Eight infusates were tested that contained various combinations of glucose, lipid emulsion and amino acids. The infusate nonprotein energy level was the predominant effector of liver lipid content. The excessive energy level was associated with significant increments in steatosis, ranging from a 26% increase for high-fat, adequate-nitrogen infusates to a 95% increase for low-fat, adequate-nitrogen infusates. An interaction of amino nitrogen level and glucose-lipid calorie distribution also affected the severity of steatosis. The steatosis observed with inadequate-nitrogen infusates was accentuated in combination with the high-fat calorie distribution and was attenuated with the low-fat calorie distribution. The most striking effect of nitrogen inadequacy was a 3-fold increase in liver lipid content with the excessive calorie, high-fat infusates. The infusate that minimized steatosis provided energy and nitrogen at adequate levels and was low in fat content. This infusate also led to liver lipid composition and plasma lipid levels that most closely resembled those of rats fed stock diet.\r"

  ".W": "Fat emulsions are increasingly utilized as intravenous calorie sources in patients requiring total parenteral nutrition. In the United States, they are traditionally administered separate from the dextrose/amino acid solution because of concern regarding physical stability and clinical safety when fat emulsions are administered, having been mixed with the dextrose solution. The separate infusion entails multiple manipulations of the infusion system with increased risk of contamination and sepsis and increased cost in maintaining two infusion lines. This prospective sequential two-phase clinical study evaluated solution compatibility and clinical safety of an admixture of fat emulsion (Intralipid 20%), dextrose, amino acids (Veinamine 8%), electrolytes, vitamins, and trace minerals. Continuous infusion of this solution in 25 adult patients from 2 to 35 days did not result in any adverse clinical reactions or abnormal laboratory parameters. Gross, visual examination and in vitro analysis of the admixture solutions revealed no physical instability or changes in fatty acid composition in admixture solutions stored at 4 degrees C for up to 6 weeks.\r"

  ".W": "Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an intestinal mucosal enzyme which serves as a marker of cellular maturity and integrity in ontogeny and after mucosal injury in the gastrointestinal tract. Since total parenteral nutrition is known to result in intestinal hypoplasia, this study was done to determine the effect of enteral and parenteral delivery of nutrients on gut structure and DAO levels. Central venous catheters were placed in 27 Sprague-Dawley rats (180-260 g), which received nutrients for 12 days via parenteral nutrition (GpI n = 10), oral intake of the parenteral solution (GpII n = 8), or standard rat chow (GpIII n = 9). Gross and microscopic measurements were made at sacrifice. Mucosal DAO levels were determined by metabolism of [3H] putrescine. Group III animals had a greater caloric intake than groups I and II, and were the only group with a significant increase in body weight. Gut weight, mucosal weight, and villous height were significantly less in group I vs groups II and III; group II values were less than group III (p less than 0.05). Both DAO specific activity and total gut DAO were significantly less in group I and group II. Mucosal DAO content correlated with total gut and mucosal weight. DAO mucosal levels decrease with parenteral nutrition, reflecting the intestinal hypoplasia that occurs. Mucosal DAO content may be dependent on both caloric intake and diet composition. Since serum DAO levels are known to correlate with mucosal DAO content, DAO activity may prove useful as a circulating marker of the effect of nutritional therapy on the intestinal mucosa.\r"

Seventy patients were randomized in a prospective, double-blind fashion to receive either placebo (n = 35) or metoclopramide, 10 mg (n = 35) parenterally, administered immediately after the feeding tube was inserted. Tube location was determined independently by two observers who examined radiographs obtained after barium was instilled via the tube. There was no significant increase in the success rate of duodenal intubation in the total group following metoclopramide, 60%, compared to placebo, 49%. However, analysis of subgroups among the placebo-treated patients revealed that diabetes mellitus, but not other medical conditions, decreased the success rate for duodenal intubation, 20 vs 60% (p less than 0.05). Among diabetic patients, metoclopramide resulted in a significant increase in duodenal placement compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). We conclude that parenteral metoclopramide significantly increases the frequency of transpyloric intubation with small feeding tubes without fluoroscopic guidance in diabetic patients but not in nondiabetic patients.\r"

Recovered organisms included Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, and Micrococcus. Sample analysis failed to demonstrate significant differences in extrinsic microbial contamination rate or organism multiplication between samples infusing for less than or equal to 12 hr and those infusing longer. Although these products support microbial growth, the contaminants introduced into the infusate by environmental or touch contamination yielded minimal colony growth. No patient developed signs or symptoms of bacteremia during the study period. Therefore, infusion of intravenous fat emulsion products over extended periods of time in this study did not increase the risk of developing infectious complications.\r"

Groups 2 and 4 were supplemented with 100 mg L-carnitine/kg/day. The MCT-alimented rats presented with a distinct excretion of the dicarboxylic acids: adipic acid (C6), suberic acid (C8), and sebacic acid (C10). The acids excreted corresponded to the infused pattern of monocarboxylic acids: caproic acid (C6), caprylic acid (C8), and capric acid (C10). Dicarboxylic acid excretion after MCT administration may reflect an insufficient capacity of beta-oxidation on one hand or a preferential omega-oxidation of medium-chain fatty acids on the other. Carnitine supplementation lead to a further increase of the dicarboxylic acids in the MCT-group. beta-OH-butyric acid excretion decreased after carnitine in the MCT as well as in the LCT group. An increased transport of fatty acid-carnitine compounds out of the mitochondria is discussed as an important effect of carnitine supplementation. Hereby medium-chain fatty acids may be more accessible for omega-oxidation.\r"

These data then were compared with the allowed length of stay and estimated reimbursement under the prospective payment system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Forty-five percent of the malnourished patients were hospitalized longer than that allowed under DRGs, compared to 30% for normal patients and 37% in the borderline group. The average length of stay was 15.6 +/- 2.2 days in the malnourished group compared to approximately 10 days in the other two groups (p less than 0.01). Although the estimated base DRG reimbursement was similar in all three groups ($4352-$5124), the actual hospital charges were significantly greater in the malnourished ($16,691 +/- 4389) and borderline ($14,118 +/- 4962) groups compared to normals ($7692 +/- 687), (p less than 0.01). The DRG system will have an adverse financial impact in the care of malnourished patients. It is suggested that early recognition of malnutrition and aggressive treatment may lead to a decrease in the length of stay and cost deficit incurred by malnourished patients.\r"

  ".W": "Current hospital cost containment pressures have prompted a critical evaluation of whether nutritional support teams render more clinically effective and efficient patient care than nonteam management. To address this question with regard to enteral feeding, 102 consecutive hospitalized patients who required enteral nutritional support (ENS) by tube feeding during a 3 1/2-month period were prospectively studied. Fifty patients were managed by a nutritional support team; the other 52 were managed by their primary physicians. Choice of enteral formula, formula modifications, frequency of laboratory tests, and amounts of energy and protein received were recorded daily. In addition, each patient was monitored for pulmonary, mechanical, gastrointestinal, and metabolic abnormalities. Team-managed (T) and nonteam-managed (NT) patients received ENS for 632 and 398 days, respectively. The average time period for ENS was significantly longer in the team-managed patients (12.6 +/- 12.1 days vs 7.7 +/- 6.2 days, p less than 0.01). Significantly more of the team patients attained 1.2 X basal energy expenditure (BEE) (37 vs 26, p less than 0.05). Total number of abnormalities in each group was similar (T = 398, NT = 390); however, the abnormalities per day were significantly lower in the team group (T = 0.63 vs NT = 0.98, p less than 0.01). Mechanical (T = 0.05 vs NT = 0.11, p less than 0.01), gastrointestinal (T = 0.99 vs NT = 0.14, p less than 0.05), and metabolic (T = 0.49 vs NT = 0.72, p less than 0.01) abnormalities per day all were significantly lower in the team-managed patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, the effect of the qualitative pattern of amino acid solutions has not been studied. Rats on parenteral nutrition for 5 days received 10.2 g of dextrose and 3.4 g of amino acids daily. Bile flow (microliter/min/g liver protein) after administration of Vamin was 16.2 +/- 0.8, which was similar to that in controls given chow and dextrose iv, but it was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than those on Travasol (12.3 +/- 0.8). The decrease in bile flow was not related to the large concentrations of alanine and glycine present in Travasol. However, the addition to Travasol of serine present only in Vamin increased bile flow significantly. Bile acid secretion rate, biliary lipid constituents, calcium, sodium, and glucose showed little change. In contrast, alpha-amino nitrogen was increased (p less than 0.05) in Vamin-perfused animals. Steatosis was noted in only a few animals in the Travasol group, and was not associated with an increase in the triglycerides content of the liver. Glycogen and protein content of the livers did not differ. The data show that the composition of amino acid solutions may be a determinant of TPN-induced cholestasis and suggest that the presence of methyl donor amino acids may have a protective effect.\r"

Current methods for determining TFN, specifically, radial immunodiffusion (RID) plates or derivation from total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), are relatively expensive, time consuming (20-50 hr) and technically demanding, limiting the use of TFN levels in the routine screening for PCM. A rapid (60-90 min), accurate and precise TFN assay, easily performed with common laboratory equipment, was developed for use in a study of hospitalized patients. This assay requires 15 microliter of plasma and is based on an antigen-antibody reaction using commercially available TFN antibody. After a 30-min incubation, turbidity is measured at 413 nm on a spectrophotometer with a 1-cm path length. Values by this method are linear over the range of 50-760 mg/dl. Plasma samples (n = 72) were assayed for TFN by this turbidimetric (TURB) technique and the standard RID technique. Correlation between the two assays was r = 0.942 over the range of TFN = 81-403 mg/dl (TFNRID = 30.7 + (0.931) TFNTURB). Coefficient of variation (CV) for TFNTURB was 4.0%. RID kit insert reports a CV = 2.9% at a value of 380 mg/dl. This assay overcomes many of the difficulties associated with TFN determination by RID or derived from TIBC and may allow more widespread application of plasma TFN levels as a clinically relevant PCM screening tool.\r"

We discuss the use of TPN with fat emulsions in this patient who was unable to tolerate enteral feedings during pregnancy. The patient underwent a 4-week period without oral intake. Total parenteral nutrition enabled continued fetal growth, resulting in a good outcome for the patient and her infant. This report supports the early use of TPN in pregnancy complicated by inadequate caloric intake.\r"

A patient was included in the study if his serum glucose was greater than 200 mg/dl at a TPN infusion rate of less than 75% of the calculated caloric goal. The insulin infusion was run into the central line with the TPN via a Y-connector. At the patient's caloric goal, the infusion was stopped and the insulin was added to the TPN bottle, after the glucose was in the 100-200 mg/dl range for 24 hr. Sixteen patients including five known diabetics were studied, with data gathered retrospectively through chart review. It was estimated that 7.3 liters of TPN per patient were saved, compared to the amount used when insulin was added to newly prepared bottles of TPN each time a dosage change was required. In our institution, this amounts to a savings of $395.00 per patient (including charges for materials and an infusion pump for the insulin infusion). We conclude that separate insulin infusion is a reasonable and cost-effective alternative when treating glucose intolerance in patients receiving TPN.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant interleukin-2 (RIL 2)-activated autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were infused directly into the renal arteries of 3 patients with renal cell carcinoma, and the in vivo distribution of the infused cells was investigated. In vitro studies to define the optimal culture conditions indicated that maximal lymphokine-activated killer activity was observed at around 10-20 days in culture, as judged by the cytotoxicity against fresh allogenic tumor cells. Maximal expression of the interleukin-2 receptor was also obtained at around 10 days. PBL collected by leukopheresis from each patient were thus cultured for 10 days with RIL 2, labeled with 111In-oxine, and then infused directly into the renal artery of the affected kidney via a catheter. Radioactivity in the infused side of the kidneys increased immediately after the infusion but then gradually decreased. Radioactivity in the lungs also rapidly increased within the first hour but then cleared gradually, whereas that in the liver and spleen tended to increase steadily. Nevertheless, at 48 hours, the infused side of the kidneys retained levels of radioactivity comparable to those seen in the liver and spleen, while the levels seen in the lungs were already close to background levels. The radioactivity in the areas corresponding to tumors remained consistently higher than that in the normal parts of the affected kidneys. The direct comparison of the radioactivity distribution pattern with the macroscopic appearance of surgically resected kidneys indicated that the accumulation of radioactivity was indeed selectively associated with the tumor tissues in the kidneys, except for a case in which the tumor was quite necrotic and hypovascular. Histological examinations indicated intensive mononuclear cell infiltrations in and around the tumor tissues as well as in normal tissues in the kidneys. These preliminary results indicated that infusion of activated lymphocytes via major tumor-feeding arteries would be an extremely effective way to obtain the selective localization of effector cells in the tumor tissues.\r"

  ".W": "It was previously shown that the administration of dexamethasone (Dex) to mice bearing mammary adenocarcinoma caused the collagen content of the tumor capsule to be decreased by 50%, but collagenase and other neutral protease activities of the tumor were the same as in the controls. These events occurred with distinctly increased tumor invasion and metastasis. The present communication reports on the characterization of capsule collagen and the effects of agents [vitamin A (VA) and Dex] on capsule collagen metabolism and presents further evidence concerning the possible mechanisms by which the collagen content of the capsule was decreased in the Dex-treated hosts. The collagen extracted from capsules of untreated controls and mice (C3H/HeJ) treated with VA or Dex was primarily type I, as judged by the migration of protein bands in sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by patterns of elution peaks from an octadecyl C-18 column. The amino acid compositions of type I collagen of the capsule of treated and untreated controls were similar but not identical to those of mouse skin and guinea pig skin type I collagens. The specific activity of intracellular free [14C] proline, the extent of hydroxylation of [14C]proline residues of collagen, and the specific activity of [14C]hydroxyproline and proline in each case were similar in treated and in untreated controls. These results suggest that the observed 45% decrease in the conversion of [14C]proline into protein-bound [14C]hydroxyproline of the Dex-treated hosts apparently was due to decreased collagen synthesis. The data also suggest that the most critical effects of Dex on tumor invasion and metastasis appeared to occur at an early stage before full formation of the collagenous extracellular matrix.\r"

  ".W": "Transplantation success rates of primary 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene [(DMBA) CAS: 57-97-6]-induced rat mammary carcinomas and normal rat mammary glandular epithelium into female athymic mice were compared. The rat mammary carcinomas obtained from female Sprague-Dawley rats were transplanted into host athymic mice (6-8 wk of age) as 1 x 1-cm slices xenografted sc (2 slices/mouse) or as enzymatically dissociated cells inoculated into the gland-free mammary fat pad. Normal rat mammary glands (No. 4 glands and 3- to 5-mo-old virgin rats) were transplanted into host athymic mice as whole, intact mammary glands sc (1 gland/mouse) or as enzymatically dissociated cells inoculated into the gland-free mammary fat pad. All (100%) of the normal rat mammary glands were readily accepted and maintained in the athymic mice when transplanted either sc as whole glands or as dispersed cells inoculated into the gland-free fat pad. In contrast, only 13-14% of the DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinomas were accepted and maintained in the athymic mice (transplanted as slices sc or as dispersed cells inoculated into the gland-free fat pad). Treatment of host athymic nude mice with an intense mammotropic hormonal stimulus (prolactin and/or ovarian steroids) markedly enhanced the developmental growth of the transplanted normal rat mammae (subcutaneous slices and fat-pad inoculates); such a hormonal stimulus did not influence the transplantation success rate of the DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinomas. Thus female athymic nude mice can readily accept and maintain transplants of normal rat mammae but not carcinogen-induced carcinomatous rat mammae; the meager acceptance rate of the carcinomatous rat mammae by the athymic nude mouse was not enhanced by providing the host mice with a potent mammotropic hormonal growth stimulant.\r"

  ".W": "During the acute renal tubular dysfunction of Fanconi syndrome and type 2 renal tubular acidosis (FS/RTA2) induced by maleic acid in the unanesthetized dog, we observed: 30 minutes after the onset of FS/RTA2, the urinary excretion of lysosomal enzymes, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), beta-glucuronidase (beta-gluc) and beta-galactosidase (beta-galac), increased simultaneously with the anticipated increase in renal clearance of lysozyme; the severities of all these hyperenzymurias increased rapidly, progressively, and in parallel, all reaching a peak some 60 to 80 minutes after their onset; thereafter, while the FS/RTA2 continued undiminished in severity, the severity of the hyperenzymurias decreased rapidly, greatly, progressively, and in parallel; and sodium phosphate loading strikingly attenuated the FS/RTA2 and the hyperenzymurias. Thus, the maleic acid-induced FS/RTA2 is attended by an acute reversible-complex derangement in the renal tubular processing of proteins that: affects not only lysozyme which is normally filtered, but also NAG and other lysosomal enzymes, which are not; and is to some extent functionally separable from that of FS/RTA2. The findings suggest that the derangements in renal processing of lysozyme and lysosomal enzymes are linked, and that a phosphate-dependent metabolic abnormality in the proximal tubule can participate in the pathogenesis of both these derangements and the FS/RTA2.\r"

When 100 ml of AS-1 solution is added to erythrocytes, a hematocrit of 59 +/- 5% is consistently obtained, and the resultant product has an improved flow rate. When we compared the infusion flow rates of whole blood and AS-1-preserved erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo, we found that flow times were shorter for AS-1 erythrocytes than for whole blood in vitro and in vivo, the flow rates of AS-1 erythrocytes and whole blood when expressed per volume were similar in vivo, and the flow rate of AS-1 erythrocytes for erythrocyte mass delivery in vivo was superior to that of whole blood. Thus, we conclude that the flow rates of the two products are comparable.\r"

Upper airway obstruction is caused by an enlarged tongue, deformed pharynx, and short, thick neck. Its eventual lethal outcome by the second decade of life is known to result from an infiltrative cardiomyopathy leading to irreversible heart failure. Instead, our recent experience in the care of five patients with this disorder suggests the lethal event is related to progressive obstruction sequentially involving the upper, mid, and lower airway characterized by gradual deformation and collapse of the trachea. Autopsy and histopathologic whole organ sections demonstrate anteroposterior flattening of the trachea and bronchi with submucosal thickening producing structural alterations known only to this disease.\r"

  ".U": "87143725\r", 
  ".W": "Renal failure (RF) occurring in the course of multiple myeloma is often judged irreversible and generally considered an ominous complication. The aim of the present study was to re-evaluate the outcome, triggering conditions and prognostic factors of severe RF in a series of 34 patients, 33 to 90 years old. RF was totally reversible in 7 patients and partially reversible in 9 although 6 of them had to be temporarily dialyzed. However, the improvement in renal function was often very slow as indicated by an average recovery time of 115 days. The high rate of RF reversibility was associated with markedly lengthened survival. Review of triggering events confirmed the leading role of dehydration and hypercalcemia, but further suggested that intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and renal infection might play a part in the development of RF. Systematic statistical analysis of potential prognostic factors showed that the outcome was significantly more severe in females, but age, myeloma characteristics including tumor mass, calcemia, and triggering events had no predictive value. The most reliable prognostic indicators were provided by analysis of kidney biopsy performed in 30 patients. Complete recovery from RF was observed only in the absence of global tubular atrophy and interstitial damage. In contrast, cast-induced tubular obstruction detected by the presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein in urinary space of glomeruli did not seem to influence the outcome of RF. Finally, we analyzed the prognostic value of immunochemical properties of light chains (LC). Lambda LC were unexpectedly detected in 2 of 3 patients, as compared to a ratio of 1 to 3 in the population of normal and monoclonal Ig, but LC type did not correlate with the course of RF. Isoelectric points of LC measured in 32 patients were dispersed from 5.2 to 8.9 and bore only weak prognostic significance. These results underline the value of kidney biopsy and justify aggressive treatment including dialysis and chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from 35 patients with biopsy-proven diffuse proliferative (WHO class IV) or membranous (WHO class V) lupus nephritis were analyzed for the presence and size of circulating immune complexes. Elevations of the C1q solid-phase assay (C1qSP) for immune complexes were found in sera from all patients with diffuse proliferative nephritis, with a mean +/- 1 SEM of 166.8 +/- 42.0 micrograms/AHG-equivalents/ml serum, and in 71.4% of the patients with membranous nephritis (83.1 +/- 26.7, p = 0.06). Using the WHO criteria for subclasses of membranous lupus nephritis, we also designated renal biopsies as nonproliferative (WHO classes Va and Vb) or proliferative (WHO classes IV and Vc). Employing the latter groupings, we observed significant differences between C1qSP results of patients with nonproliferative (30.3 +/- 8.8) and proliferative (172.8 +/- 36.8, p less than 0.001) lupus nephritis. These data suggest that the presence of C1q-binding material in serum is pathophysiologically related to proliferative glomerular lesions, and that levels of C1qSP binding reflect renal lesions in SLE patients. Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed on each serum, and gradient fractions analyzed for C1qSP-binding and total IgG, using techniques to minimize losses of immune complexes. The predominant peak of C1qSP activity sedimented with the 6.6S monomeric IgG. The 6.6S C1q-binding IgG was increased only in 1 of 10 patients with membranous lupus nephritis without proliferative changes, and was elevated in 16 of 25 patients with proliferative lesions (WHO classes IV and Vc). A significant negative correlation was found between the presence of this C1q-binding material and subepithelial electron-dense deposits, suggesting that the presence of this material contributed to the absence of subepithelial immune deposits. Large-molecular-weight C1qSP-binding material was also present, mainly in sera from patients with proliferative lesions. Furthermore, highly positive correlations were found between immune deposits in interstitial blood vessels and peritubular areas, and the concentrations of C1qSP-binding IgG and rapidly sedimenting IgG in density gradient analysis. Overall, these findings are consistent with the hypotheses that circulating immune complexes contribute to the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis and interstitial nephritis in patients with SLE, and that 6.6S C1q-binding IgG plays a role in the proliferative lesions of lupus glomerulonephritis.\r"
