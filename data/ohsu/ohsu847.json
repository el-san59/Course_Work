  ".W": "The relationship between urinary excretion of catecholamine and/or its metabolites before the initiation of therapy and the genomic amplification of N-myc of the extirpated primary tumors was studied in 32 patients who had advanced neuroblastoma (stages III and IV). Values of vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, and noradrenaline excreted in urine were significantly higher in patients with 1 to 10 copies of N-myc (L-group) than in those patients who had more than 10 copies (H-group), whereas values of dopamine in urine were not significantly different between the groups. The ratio of urinary noradrenaline and dopamine was also significantly higher in the L-group. N-myc amplification, urinary excretion of vanillylmandelic acid and the noradrenaline/dopamine ratio significantly affected the prognosis. These data suggest that an inverse regulatory mechanism might be present between the N-myc amplification and catecholamine metabolism in patients who have advanced neuroblastoma, possibly at the level of gene and/or enzyme. These events would influence the prognosis. The main blockade of the metabolism may be in the metabolic processes from dopamine to noradrenaline.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a potent 53-amino-acid residue polypeptide that has been implicated in normal wound healing. Although past studies have shown that locally applied EGF accelerates wound healing, these studies have not examined intracellular events related to the processing of the growth factor. The objective of this study was to characterize both initial and later postbinding intracellular processing of EGF by a responsive cell line (osteoblasts) that is important in the healing of wounds. Cloned mouse calvarial osteoblasts (MC-3TC-E1) were incubated with radiolabeled EGF, with and without preincubation with nonlabeled EGF, for specific time intervals. Cell-associated radioactivity was characterized by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results showed that EGF is processed as three distinct species and that the relative proportions of these species are altered at later time periods when compared with initial processing. The patterns, similar to those reported for human fibroblasts, indicate a possible common pathway for the mitogenic signal in cells associated with the early events of wound healing. In addition, these data represent the first direct evidence that preexposure of cells to nonlabeled EGF alters the processing of radiolabeled EGF. This is significant, because cells must be exposed to EGF for 5 to 8 hours to elicit a growth response. Such data may help to explain the \"lag phase\" of wound healing.\r"

  ".U": "90117354\r", 
  ".W": "When a streptococcal preparation, OK-432, was administered intraperitoneally to patients with malignant ascites, lymphocytes with cytotoxic activity against tumor cells increased in number in the peritoneal cavity after 5 to 7 days. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of such lymphocyte accumulation, lymphocyte chemotactic activity (LCA) in ascitic fluid was measured by a modification of the Boyden method. High LCA was found on the third and fourth days after the OK-432 injection. This LCA was generated in the cell-free supernatant of the patients' abdominal neutrophils that accumulated in the peritoneal cavity 24 hours after the injection of OK-432. A similar LCA was also found when normal peripheral neutrophils were incubated with OK-432. Incubation of normal neutrophils without OK-432 failed to generate LCA, however, and OK-432 alone had no LCA. We tentatively named this factor \"neutrophil-derived lymphocyte chemotactic factor\" (NDLCF). The NDLCF was heat stable and nondializable, and its molecular weight was approximately 45,000 daltons. It attracted mainly natural killer cells by immunoperoxidase assay of migrated lymphocytes in the chemotactic membrane. These characteristics were distinct from C5a, interleukin-1, and interleukin-2. The results suggest that the newly found NDLCF may be responsible for the infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes, especially natural killer cells in the peritoneal cavity in patients with malignant ascites when treated by intraperitoneal injections of OK-432.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 26 patients with systemic mast cell disease (SMCD) treated during the past decade at the National Institutes of Health were reviewed to determine the role of splenectomy in the management of SMCD. Seventeen (65%) patients had indolent SMCD, manifested primarily by urticaria pigmentosa and mast cell infiltration of the skin, bone marrow, or gastrointestinal tract. None of these patients underwent splenectomy. These patients required only symptomatic therapy. Nine (35%) patients, including those with associated hematologic disorders and those with a lymphoma-like illness termed lymphadenopathic mastocytosis with eosinophilia, had aggressive SMCD. Five of nine patients with aggressive SMCD underwent splenectomy. Of the five patients with splenectomy, three were alive at the time of this report, whereas none of the four who did not have a splenectomy was still alive. Length of survival without splenectomy was 26 months. With splenectomy, length of survival at the time of this report was 34 months. Patients without splenectomy died of bleeding caused by severe thrombocytopenia. Patients with splenectomy appeared better able to tolerate chemotherapy. We thus conclude that while splenectomy is of no value in the management of indolent mastocytosis, it should be considered in patients with aggressive SMCD.\r"

  ".U": "90117632\r", 
  ".W": "The standards of the American Association of Blood Banks require that blood for reissue must be maintained continuously between 1 and 10 degrees C. To comply with this standard, most transfusion services have set a 30-minute limit on the time that a unit of blood can be out of a monitored refrigerator before it must be discarded. The primary reason for such a time limit is to reduce the risk that small numbers of contaminating bacteria could grow to lethal numbers before the blood is administered. An extensive review of the pertinent literature revealed that the organisms that may survive refrigeration (i.e., psychrophilic bacteria) are unable to begin logarithmic phase growth for several hours after returning to room temperature. This is due to alterations in bacterial enzyme systems and membrane lipids that occur during growth at refrigerator temperatures and that must be repaired before rapid growth may occur. On the basis of this information, it appears that the 30-minute limit could be extended to 2 hours without any increased risk to the recipient. Such a policy change could save 18,000 units of blood per year in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "This study was an analysis of graft survival in patients transplanted during the 1984 to 1988 cyclosporine era. 1. The 1-year first cadaver donor graft survival rate was 77 in whites and 70 in blacks. This difference increased by the third year to 65 in whites and 49 in blacks. 2. The corresponding second graft survival was 67 for whites and 60 for blacks in the first year and 53 for whites and 39 for blacks in the third year. 3. The same graft survival was noted in whites for patients older than 15. For blacks, the 3-year survival for older patients (over 45 years of age) was higher (50%) than for those 15 to 30 years old (43%). 4. The yearly trend for whites has been that older patients have had graft survival equivalent to young patients. However, among blacks, survival in young patients did not improve with the introduction of cyclosporine, and survival of older blacks was the same as for older whites. 5. The difference in graft survival between whites and blacks was greater for young males than females. 6. In both races, immunologic failures occurred more often in young patients than in older ones. 7. Patients with various original diseases consistently showed superior survival in whites as compared to blacks. Only in SLE patients did blacks have higher survival rates. 8. The half-life of transplants in blacks was lower than in whites in the 1974 to 1979 period as well as from 1980 to 1988. The half-life was about 8 years in whites and about 4 years in blacks. 9. Parental donor and HLA-identical sibling donor grafts in blacks had about the same graft survival as corresponding grafts in whites. Thus, when the HLA chromosome had been matched, the race effect disappeared. 10. We postulate that noncompliance may have been the major factor resulting in lower graft survival in young black males. A suggested ideal solution to the problem is recruitment of more black cadaver donors in order to achieve excellent matches.\r"

Further studies are necessary to evaluate the possible etiologic role of infected urine pre- and/or postoperatively, urethral catheterization pre- and postoperatively, catheter material, and the type and size of the resectoscope. A narrow urethra is probably a predisposing factor for stricture formation, but this is not definitively clarified. Only few randomized studies have been performed to evaluate the different prophylactic methods against development of strictures postresection. Resection via perineal urethrotomy, perhaps preceded by urethral calibration, seems to be a way to avoid anterior urethral strictures. The effects of internal urethrotomy preoperatively on stricture formation are conflicting. Further randomized studies are necessary.\r"

Forty-five subjects with active aphthous ulcers were recruited into this double-blind study designed to compare treatment of aphthous ulcers using sucralfate or placebo in a powdered spray. Measures of ulcer diameter and area were recorded before and after four days of treatment and the subjects completed a daily log measuring subjective response to the treatment. Sucralfate, as used in this study, was not found to be effective in the treatment of aphthous ulcers.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and congestive heart failure (CHF) have an increased risk of sudden death, yet suppression of arrhythmia in this population is frequently complicated by proarrhythmia and by the negative inotropic effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of moricizine in patients with clinical CHF. The New Drug Application data base submitted to the Food and Drug Administration was analyzed. A total of 908 patients were treated with moricizine for ventricular arrhythmias; CHF developed in 49 of them (5.4%). Of the 908 patients, 374 had a history of CHF, 326 of whom tolerated moricizine for a mean of 97 +/- 217 days. New-onset CHF occurred only once (1/546 = 0.2%). Recurrence or exacerbation of clinical CHF during treatment with moricizine occurred in 48 of 374 patients (12.8%), 28 of whom continued to take moricizine with alteration in CHF therapy. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of those patients in whom CHF developed was 26%. It is important to note that patients with a history of CHF were as likely to have suppression of VPBs (defined as greater than or equal to 75% reduction) as those without a history of CHF. In fact, suppression of arrhythmia was achieved as often in patients with LVEF less than 30% as in those with more preserved LVEF. Of the 374 patients with a history of CHF, 15 (4%) had a proarrhythmic event within 14 days of therapy. The incidence of sudden cardiac death in this group was 0.8%. These proarrhythmia rates compare favorably with those of other antiarrhythmic drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent data suggest Doppler ultrasound and two-dimensional echocardiography more accurately estimate the mitral valve area in patients with mixed mitral valvular disease. This study assessed the accuracy of an alternate method, the hemodynamic pressure half-time method, for mitral valve area determination in such patients. In 22 patients, 28 separate mitral valve areas were calculated by the hemodynamic pressure half-time method, the Gorlin formula, and the Gorlin formula corrected for mitral regurgitation, and were compared with results calculated by the Doppler pressure half-time method. Six patients were studied both before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty. In addition, mitral valve areas calculated by all four methods were compared with results obtained by planimetry in 15 patients with technically optimal echocardiograms. The mitral valve areas determined by hemodynamic pressure half-time corretated closely with the valve areas determined by Doppler (r = 0.90), whereas mitral valve areas determined by the Gorlin formula (both without and with correction for mitral regurgitation) did not correlate as well with the Doppler-estimated valve areas (r = 0.47 and r = 0.56, respectively). Correlation between the Doppler-derived mitral valve areas and the planimetered valve areas was also good (r = 0.84), as was that between the mitral valve areas calculated by hemodynamic pressure half-time and those calculated by planimetry (r = 0.78).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results of coronary arteriography and clinical variables (history of coronary artery disease, electrocardiographic abnormalities, surgical procedures, and in-hospital mortality) were tabulated. Twenty-seven patients had type A aortic dissection and 27 patients had type B. Twenty-four patients had aortic dissection or tear (type A or B) due to motor vehicle trauma. In patients with type A, a history and/or electrocardiogram suggestive of coronary artery disease was present in 16, in whom cardiac catheterization was performed in five. None required coronary bypass surgery or died. In the 11 patients with no clinical history of coronary artery disease or electrocardiographic abnormalities, six had cardiac catheterization, none had coronary artery disease, two had coronary reimplantation, and six died. Only 1 of the 27 patients with type A dissection had a perioperative myocardial infarction (a patient with a clinical history of coronary artery disease who did not undergo cardiac catheterization). In patients undergoing type B aortic repair, 10 had a clinical history or electrocardiogram consistent with coronary artery disease but only one underwent cardiac catheterization and subsequent coronary artery bypass graft surgery for coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We compared the efficacy and safety of endocardial shocks delivered through these two electrode systems in man in a prospective randomized crossover study. Twelve patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and heart disease undergoing electrophysiologic study were evaluated. A transvenous tripolar cardioversion electrode catheter with a large distal defibrillation electrode (surface area, 400 mm2) and proximal defibrillation electrode (surface area, 800 mm2) was positioned in the right ventricular apex with a cutaneous patch electrode placed on the cardiac apex. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced at electrophysiologic study. Shocks were delivered using two catheter electrodes only (right ventricular cathode and right atrial anode = method I), and one catheter electrode and cutaneous patch (right ventricular cathode and cutaneous apical patch anode = method II). Synchronized monophasic shocks were delivered using three preselected protocols based on ventricular tachycardia cycle length and morphology. Initial shock energies were 25 joules for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, 15 joules for monomorphic rapid ventricular tachycardia (cycle length less than or equal to 300 msec), and 5 joules for monomorphic slow ventricular tachycardia (cycle length greater than 300 msec). Ventricular tachycardia was reinduced and shock energies titrated until cardioversion threshold was obtained. Identical ventricular tachycardia episodes were treated with both methods at each energy level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty was 87.9 +/- 9.9% by visual analysis and 64.6 +/- 9.2% by quantitative coronary angiography (p = 0.0001). Differences between these two techniques were also found immediately post-angioplasty (visual analysis 29.5 +/- 11.8%, quantitative coronary angiography 22.8 +/- 11.8%, p = 0.0002) and at 6 months (visual analysis 46.5 +/- 27.4%, quantitative coronary angiography 30.2 +/- 20.4%, p = 0.0001). These differences significantly affected the determination of restenosis by three definitions. (1) Lesion recurrence with greater than or equal to 50% stenosis at follow-up: 38 of 92 (41%) by visual analysis versus 20 of 92 (22%) by quantitative coronary angiography (p less than 0.01). (2) Increase of greater than or equal to 30% stenosis: 34 of 92 (37%) by visual analysis versus 20 of 92 (22%) by quantitative coronary angiography (p less than 0.01). (3) Loss of 50% of previous improvement: 31 of 92 (34%) by visual analysis versus 24 of 92 (26%) by quantitative coronary angiography (p = 0.08). In addition, determination of success or failure of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was affected by the interpretative technique, but these differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that visual estimates of lesion severity are consistently and significantly higher than quantitative measurements. Consequently, restenosis rates, using currently applied definitions, differ considerably depending on the method of analyzing lesion severity.\r"

The dosages used do not appear to be based on comparative clinical investigations. Therefore a double-blind randomized trial was carried out to establish the optimal dose of streptokinase. A total of 189 patients who had symptoms of AMI for less than 4 hours were treated with 200,000, 750,000, 1,500,000 or 3,000,000 IU streptokinase intravenously. At coronary angiography 2.8 +/- 2.7 hours (mean +/- standard deviation) after the start of streptokinase infusion, patency of the infarct-related coronary artery was observed in 38, 75, 60 and 82% of the patients, respectively, in the 4 groups. The result of the dosage of 200,000 IU was significantly poorer than that of the other dosages (p less than 0.01). The result of a dosage of 3,000,000 IU was significantly better than that of 1,500,000 IU (p less than 0.05), but the differences with 750,000 IU were not significant. Blood transfusion was required in 4 patients (2%), distributed over the 4 groups in 0, 2, 1 and 1 of the patients. One patient had major bleeding; this patient had been treated with 750,000 IU. The 3-month mortality-rate in the whole study population was 5%. Thus, of the 4 doses of streptokinase tested, 750,000 IU is the minimal therapeutic dosage, and the arguments for 1,500,000 IU as standard therapy for comparison with other fibrinolytic drugs are poor. The best results in this study were achieved with 3,000,000 IU, but further research will be needed to establish the efficacy and safety of this new regimen.\r"

To determine the role of heparin, patients with suitable angiographic features after reperfusion therapy were randomly allocated to receive a brief infusion of intravenous heparin for less than or equal to 24 hours (group 1), adjusted to a partial thromboplastin time of 2 times control or a prolonged infusion for greater than or equal to 72 hours (group 2), using the same titration mechanism. Patients were excluded for complex intimal dissections, large residual filling defects, less than Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow pattern or greater than 50% residual stenosis. Heparin was sustained except for discontinuation 2 to 4 hours before periaccess sheath removal, or if significant bleeding (greater than or equal to 2 units blood transfusion) occurred. The primary endpoints were 1-week patency determined by repeat catheterization or recurrent ischemia, or both, and the incidence of bleeding complications. Fifty patients were randomized, 25 in both groups. Baseline variables were similar; 14 group 1 and 15 group 2 patients received thrombolytic treatment; 20 patients in each group had coronary angioplasty. Two documented reocclusions occurred in both groups. Significant bleeding complications occurred in 0 of 25 (0%) group 1 versus 6 of 25 (24%) group 2 patients (p less than 0.05). Thus, in low-risk patients after successful reperfusion, prolonged heparin therapy does not protect against rethrombosis and is associated with a significantly higher rate of bleeding complications. Therefore, prolonged heparin therapy for greater than 24 hours does not appear to be justified in low-risk patients with successful reperfusion.\r"

Noninvasive detection of successful reperfusion using resolution of chest pain, ST-segment changes assessed on static electrocardiograms, arrhythmia evolution, early isoenzyme peaking or changes in ventricular perfusion or function has been hampered by poor sensitivity or specificity, or inability to provide timely information. A newly available portable programmable microprocessor-driven real-time 12-lead electrocardiographic monitor has been introduced that may address these limitations. A continuously updated precise digital record of ST-segment activity at the bedside provides valuable information both in monitoring patients during reperfusion therapy to determine the efficacy of such treatment and in the subsequent hours to signal threatened reocclusion. This report describes the salient features of the monitor and presents 4 distinct situations in which the monitor detected timely information regarding coronary patency after reperfusion.\r"

Among persons dying suddenly in the Western World atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the most common. This group might best be called atherosclerotic sudden coronary death. This article summarizes a previously published necropsy study by Warnes and Roberts of 70 victims aged 22 to 81 years (mean 50) of sudden coronary death. Of 3,484 five-mm coronary segments examined (mean 50 per patient) from the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex and right) coronary arteries, 950 (27%) were narrowed 76 to 100% in cross-sectional area by plaque; 1,127 (32%), 51 to 75%; 689 (20%), 26 to 50%, and 718 (21%), 0 to 25%. More extensive severe narrowing occurred in the proximal compared with the distal halves to the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary arteries. Comparison between the 31 previously symptomatic victims (either angina pectoris and/or a clinical acute myocardial infarction) to the 39 victims who had previously been asymptomatic disclosed a significantly higher mean percent of severely (76 to 100% in cross-sectional area) narrowed 5-mm segments (30 vs 25% [p less than 0.0051]) and a lower mean percent of minimally (0 to 25%) narrowed segments in the symptomatic group (15 vs 25%, p less than 0.001). Thus, the major coronary arteries at necropsy in victims of sudden coronary death are diffusely involved by atherosclerotic plaque and in nearly one-third of the lengths of the major arteries the lumens are narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90119480\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias continues to evolve. It is generally accepted that patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or fibrillation) require treatment. It is also generally accepted that patients with frequent or complex ventricular ectopy or nonsustained VT, in the absence of underlying heart disease, do not require treatment unless relief of symptoms is warranted. Whether patients with frequent or complex ventricular ectopy or nonsustained VT require treatment in the presence of underlying organic heart disease remains uncertain. The concern is that these ventricular arrhythmias may be a precursor for sustained, potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Available data suggest that patients with underlying heart disease, particularly coronary artery disease and a previous myocardial infarction, who manifest frequent or complex ventricular ectopy or nonsustained VT are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. However, no studies have shown that treatment of these arrhythmias will affect outcome. Data are accumulating to suggest that use of the principles of risk stratification permits identification of patients at very high risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Carefully designed clinical trials are required before one can provide firm guidelines for the management of these patients. Nevertheless, when several risk factors for sudden cardiac death (e.g., abnormal ejection fraction, a late potential on a signal-averaged electrocardiogram, and frequent or complex ventricular ectopy or nonsustained VT) are present in a patient, especially after a recent myocardial infarction, invasive electrophysiologic testing may help identify those who need treatment (sustained VT is inducible) and those who do not (no sustained VT is inducible).\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the first recorded arrhythmia in 75% of patients who have a sudden cardiovascular collapse. Rarely (1%) does sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) alone cause collapse and unconsciousness. Whether all VF begins as VT is unknown. Early application of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and rapid defibrillation are essential to ensure survival and satisfactory neurologic recovery. During the last 2 years in Seattle, the initial resuscitation rate for VF was 269 of 447 patients (60%), with 114 of 447 patients (26%) surviving long-term. Survivors of VF have a high overall risk of recurrent VF, with many univariate risk factors identified: evidence of poor left ventricular function (history of congestive heart failure, prior myocardial infarction [MI] or low ejection fraction), extensive coronary artery disease, absence of a new MI (either Q wave or non-Q wave) with VF, male gender, advanced age, complex or high-frequency ventricular ectopy on Holter recording, inducibility at electrophysiologic study, exercise-induced angina or hypotension, and smoking. Classification of cardiac deaths as arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic is important in interpreting the therapeutic response. However, because many patients have chronic symptoms, timing of the onset of a new event is difficult. Furthermore, accurate timing of an event does not guarantee correct classification. Sudden death is not necessarily arrhythmic, nor is all arrhythmic death sudden. Total cardiac mortality may be a simpler and more relevant end point to measure the overall effect of antiarrhythmic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated acetate utilization in humans by randomly intravenously infusing acetate (2.5 mmol/min) or bicarbonate (2.8 mmol/min) over 60 min into nine nondiabetic and six non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects followed with or without bolus intravenous glucose (20 g/m2 body surface area). The acetate metabolic clearance rate (MCR) was greater in the nondiabetic subjects (50.4 +/- 14.9 vs 25.0 +/- 6.5 mL.min-1.kg-1, p less than 0.01) as were acetate elimination rate constant (Kac) (0.031 +/- 0.003 vs 0.026 +/- 0.004/min, p less than 0.01) and basal turnover rate (8.56 +/- 3.65 vs 4.92 +/- 1.03 mumol.min-1.kg-1, p less than 0.01); acetate half-time was thus shorter in the nondiabetics (22.6 +/- 2.2 vs 27.2 +/- 3.8 min, p less than 0.01). Kac was reduced and half-time was prolonged in all the subjects (p less than 0.001) when glucose was available. Prior acetate or bicarbonate infusion had no influence on either the KG rate constant of glucose elimination or the postglucose insulin responses in both subject groups. These results suggest that the infused acetate did not worsen glucose tolerance, glucose impaired acetate utilization unlike reported in ruminants, and acetate is rapidly metabolized in humans although at a slower rate in diabetics.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy regarding defective thermic effect of food (TEF) in obesity might be related to differences among studies in the caloric loads. To clarify further the role of blunted thermogenesis in obesity, responses to the same absolute caloric load (720 kcal) and a relative load, which was 35% of each subject's resting metabolic rate (RMR), were compared in 11 lean (L) and 11 obese (O) men. The relative load was slightly larger for O than L (752 +/- 27 vs 683 +/- 21 kcal; means +/- SEM, NS). TEF, calculated as 3-h postprandial minus fasting RMR, was greater for L than O for both the 720-kcal (69 +/- 4 vs 31 +/- 3 kcal/3 h, p less than 0.01) and relative loads (64 +/- 4 vs 37 +/- 3 kcal/3 h, p less than 0.01). For L, TEF was greater for the 720-kcal load than for the relative load whereas for O, TEF was greater for the relative than for the 720-kcal meal. However, expressed as a percent of the calories ingested, TEF for the absolute and relative meals was identical for each group, in both cases lower for O (4.2 +/- 0.4% vs. 4.7 +/- 0.3%) than for L (9.7 +/- 0.4% vs 9.3 +/- 0.8%); p less than 0.01. These results demonstrate the impact on thermogenesis of the basis on which the meal is dosed and provide further evidence for defective thermogenesis in obesity.\r"

All residents were in good glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose 7.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L) at entry into the study. During the regular-diet period, fasting plasma glucose increased an average of 0.6 mmol/L for all residents. Caloric intake increased during the regular-diet period although body weight did not change significantly. In both study periods nutrient intake of the residents met or exceeded the Recommended Dietary Allowances for the age group. These results indicate that the short-term substitution of regular for diabetic diets did not result in gross deterioration of glycemic control in patients with NIDDM confined to chronic-care facilities.\r"

Total dietary fiber was significantly related to GI (r = 0.461, p less than 0.05). Soluble fiber was not significantly related to GI (r = 0.308), and uronic acids in insoluble fiber were most closely related to GI (r = 0.584, p less than 0.01). Multiple-regression analysis showed that more variation of GI was explained by uronic acids in insoluble fiber (34%) than by total dietary fiber alone (21%, p = 0.05). The combination of pentoses, hexoses, and uronic acids in soluble and insoluble fiber explained only 50% of GI variability. In determining the potential metabolic effects of diet, physiologic assessment of foods is a useful supplement to chemical analysis of their dietary fiber content and composition.\r"

Increasing exercise increases the thermic effect of exercise and prevents a decrease in resting metabolic rate, thereby, improving the rate of weight loss. A combined program of caloric restriction, exercise, and behavior therapy (including relapse prevention training and social support systems) is the most successful approach to long term weight reduction efforts. Pharmacologic treatment is currently limited, but there are three areas of development: agents which reduce energy intake, inhibitors of lipid synthesis, and thermogenesis enhancers. Evidence for improving efficiency of weight loss prevention and prevention of weight regain during repeated cycles of dieting (yo-yo phenomenon) exists in rat studies but not in a preliminary human investigation.\r"

The reliability of echographic interpretation varied (kappa 0.29 to 0.71), but it always exceeded that expected by chance alone, even for cups of 0.3 disk diameter or less. Subtly saucer-shaped cups (three of 50 eyes) and deep cups with intact neuroretinal rims (two of 50 eyes) were misinterpreted echographically.

The membranes contained many isolated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR- and DQ-expressing cells, and vascular endothelial cells strongly expressed class II determinants. Monoclonal antibodies to immunocompetent cells disclosed only rare B lymphocytes or suppressor/cytotoxic T cells and few monocytes. These findings confirm previous evidence of immune reactions in the pars plana of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and suggest that an autoimmune reaction is a factor in this complication. It is yet not possible to determine whether this reaction is a nonspecific consequence of the vasoproliferative processes or if it plays a direct role in the development and extension of preretinal membranes.\r"

  ".W": "The neoplastic Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells in Hodgkin's disease are surrounded in vivo by abundant reactive cells, the function of which may be attributed in part to their elaboration of various cytokines. Thus, a study of the interaction of H-RS cells with exogenous cytokines may provide information as to the mechanism of the clinical and histopathologic changes observed in Hodgkin's disease. This study examined the effect of various cytokines, and of phorbol ester (TPA) and retinoic acid, on the differentiation and proliferation of cultured H-RS cells (cell lines HDLM-1 and KM-H2). In addition, it was determined whether these cells were able to secrete cytokines after being treated with exogenous cytokines. The cytokines used included various types of interleukins (1, 2, and 3), colony-stimulating factors (GM, G, and M), interferons (alpha, beta, and gamma), and tumor necrosis factor (alpha). It was found that these cytokines, used alone or in combination, were not effective in modulating the proliferation and differentiation of cells, or the production of cytokines, in cultured H-RS cells. In contrast, this study revealed that retinoic acid can potentiate TPA-induced growth inhibition in cultured H-RS cells. Retinoic acid, when used alone, exhibited a minimal effect on cell differentiation. No synergistic effects of cytokines and retinoic acid on H-RS cells were observed. The failure of cultured H-RS cells to respond to exogenous cytokines suggests that, during the course of neoplastic transformation, of progression of disease, or of establishment of the cells in culture, H-RS cells lose their dependence on cytokines, although they retain the capacity to produce various cytokines.\r"

  ".W": "The authors have observed previously that recombinant human interleukin-1 (rhIL-1) administered into rats increased plasma fibronectin (Fn) level concomitant with the increase of Fn in the liver. Because IL-1 induces interleukin-6 (IL-6) in certain cell types, the IL-1 effect might be mediated by IL-6. To evaluate this possibility, the effect of recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6), rhIL-1 alpha, and rhIL-1 beta on Fn synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes was studied. It was shown that rhIL-6 increased Fn synthesis in hepatocytes, in contrast, rhIL-1 alpha, rhIL-I beta and TNF did not have any effect on Fn synthesis. When we studied the interaction of IL-1 and IL-6, IL-1 did not exhibit any synergistic effect with IL-6. Conditioned medium (CM) from rhIL-1 stimulated peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) increased the Fn synthesis, and its activity was neutralized significantly by anti-rhIL-6 antibodies. The CM from rhIL-1-stimulated PBM was analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and revealed the increase of IL-6. Furthermore, it was found that intraperitoneal administration of rhIL-1 induced IL-6 into blood. The administration of rhIL-6 into rats increased circulating Fn levels. These results strongly suggest that the in vivo effect of IL-1 on Fn synthesis is mediated by IL-6.\r"

Resting cells were incubated with AP-2, a complex-specific, monoclonal, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody. Examination of intact cells demonstrated a rim pattern for GPIIb/IIIa consistent with a surface localization. Permeabilization revealed a time-dependent increase in the labeling of apparent intracellular vacuoles. This pattern is distinct from the \"patch-cap\" pattern observed when unfixed platelets were incubated with fluoresceinated concanavalin A. Additionally, labeling of this vacuolar pool of GPIIb/IIIa was inhibited by treatment with 2% sodium azide or by incubation at 4 degrees C. Identical staining patterns were obtained with Fab fragments of AP-2. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the presence of labeled intracellular vacuolar structures. Parallel studies performed with AP-1, a monoclonal anti-GPIb antibody, failed to demonstrate internalization of GPIb. Finally, thrombin stimulation of resting platelets, which had been preincubated with AP-2, resulted in the clearing of this newly internalized pool of GPIIb/IIIa; presumably via translocation to the surface. These data suggest the presence of an actively cycling pool of GPIIb/IIIa that has not been described previously. The dynamic distribution of this pool may be important in the regulation of platelet adhesiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have compared the torque production of the knee flexors and extensors and developed a \"hamstring-quadricep\" ratio. Collectively, these studies indicate that the ratio of strength between the knee flexors and extensors is a function of test speed, with the ratio increasing at the faster test speeds. Unfortunately, these studies have employed the peak torque isokinetic method for making measurements. This technique suffers from a number of problems that are biomechanical and physiological in nature. Consequently, in this study, we employed comparison of the in vivo force-velocity relationship using an angle-specific method and a gravitational correction factor to more accurately determine flexor-extensor ratios and to better describe any variations occurring as a function of test speed. Nine male subjects volunteered to participate in this study. Each of the subjects participated in two test sessions. Subjects were tested at six angular velocities of 0, 48, 96, 144, 192, 240 deg/sec. At these respective test speeds, the mean flexor torques were 95.0, 94.8, 84.1, 66.2, 56.2, and 49.2 Nm, respectively. The corresponding values for the knee extensors were 252.2, 246.5, 220.7, 184.5, 161.9, and 146.4 Nm. Normalization of these torque-velocity relationships demonstrated that the in vivo force-velocity relationships of the two muscle groups are similar at slow speeds, but become disparate at higher velocities. When examining flexor-extensor torque ratios at the various test speeds, it was found that there were significant differences (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90120107\r", 
  ".W": "Blood pressure is usually well maintained during epidural or spinal anesthesia even in the presence of extensive sympathetic blockade. The authors investigated whether hormonal systems support arterial pressure and how the circulation copes with a hypoxic challenge when activation of the sympathetic nervous system is selectively impaired by neural blockade. Accordingly, the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and combined with hypoxia were evaluated in seven awake trained dogs. On different days, either bupivacaine 0.5% (8-12 ml) or saline (placebo) were randomly injected epidurally and the effects evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, as well as on hormone plasma concentrations (vasopressin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, renin) during both normoxia and hypoxia. During epidural anesthesia alone, vasopressin increased tenfold (1.7 pg/ml +/- 1.0 SD to 16.8 +/- 13.8, P less than 0.05), norepinephrine decreased (90 pg/ml +/- 31 to 61 +/- 28, P less than 0.05) while epinephrine and renin concentrations remained unchanged. Mean arterial and pulse pressure decreased by 13 mmHg and 23 mmHg (P less than 0.05), respectively. In dogs without sympathetic blockade (saline group), hypoxemia (PaO2: 31 +/- 4 mmHg) evoked an increase in mean blood pressure by 37 mmHg +/- 8 and heart rate by 50 beats per min +/- 17. In contrast, in the presence of sympathetic blockade but with a similar degree of hypoxemia, blood pressure failed to increase (+ 1 mmHg +/- 14) and heart rate rose by only 15 beats per min +/- 11. These differences between groups were statistically significant (P less than 0.001). Hypoxemia induced a similar hypocarbia (PaCO2:25 mmHg) in both groups, indicating that the ventilatory response to hypoxemia was preserved after epidural blockade. During hypoxemia vasopressin concentrations increased 35-fold to 64 pg/ml +/- 38 (P less than 0.0001) compared to base line only during epidural anesthesia, but not after epidural saline (2 pg/ml +/- 2), while other hormones showed no significant differences. The authors conclude that high epidural anesthesia in awake unsedated dogs: 1) almost completely abolishes the normal cardiovascular response to hypoxemia while promoting vasopressin secretion; 2) preserves the ventilatory response to hypoxemia; and 3) is associated with increased vasopressin concentrations, most likely to compensate for decreased cardiac filling and/or arterial blood pressure when sympathoadrenal responses are impaired. Thus, the changes in cardiovascular vital signs in response to severe hypoxemia are markedly blunted when spinal sympathetic outflow is selectively eliminated by epidural anesthesia.\r"

He does not identify the precise date nor the experimenters. However, at the time of this event Willis would have been at Oxford. There he was a very close professional associate of Christopher Wren who originated the practice of iv injection.

The program records the simulated patient's vital signs and all management decisions, and produces a printed case summary. The Anesthesia Simulator-Recorder was evaluated by 44 resident and attending anesthesiologists at seven different anesthesia training centers. These anesthesiologists found the simulator easy to use with clear presentation of the case and management options. The physiological and pharmacological models produced clinically realistic predictions of patient behavior (mean score = 8.5, where 10 is highly realistic and 1 is unrealistic). The Anesthesia Simulator-Recorder was appraised as an excellent training device (mean score = 8.5, where 10 is outstanding and 1 is poor) because it provides the ability to repeatedly practice the management of critical incidents. The simulator was judged to be a good evaluation device (mean score = 6.6, where 10 is outstanding and 1 is poor). No significant differences were found in evaluations between the institution where the program was developed and other institutions, or between residents and attendings.\r"

The influence of short-term pretreatment with captopril on blood pressure and renal function was assessed double-blind versus placebo in 18 patients without pre-existing cardiac or renal failure, and undergoing coronary artery bypass. No difference in blood pressure and fluid requirement during the surgical period was observed between groups receiving captopril or placebo. Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased in the placebo group whereas they remained unaltered in the captopril group; during cardiopulmonary bypass, urinary excretion of sodium was greater in patients receiving captopril than those receiving placebo. These results suggest that captopril pretreatment does not compromise the control of blood pressure and renal function during open heart surgery; additional studies on the protective value of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are warranted in patients at higher risk for developing renal failure.\r"

After establishing effective epidural analgesia with 12 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine, 72 parturients in active labor were randomly assigned to one of four groups: physician-controlled continuous epidural infusion using 0.125% bupivacaine (CEI); PCEA using 0.125% bupivacaine (B); PCEA using 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 1 micrograms/ml (BF); and PCEA using 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 1 micrograms/ml and 1:400,000 epinephrine (BFE). The CEI infusion was begun at 12-16 ml/h and adjusted to maintain a T10 sensory level and adequate pain relief. PCEA pumps were programmed to deliver a 6 ml/h basal infusion, 4 ml on-demand boluses, 10-min lockout intervals between doses, and a 20 ml hourly limit. Hemodynamic parameters, sensory level, quality of analgesia, duration of labor, overall satisfaction, and Apgar scores did not differ among groups. Compared with CEI, PCEA with plain bupivacaine did not decrease total local anesthetic usage or average hourly infusion rates during labor. However, addition of fentanyl (groups BF and BFE) decreased hourly infusion requirements. Average hourly infusion rates were 13.0 +/- 1.1 ml/h (B), 10.6 +/- 0.6 ml/h (BF), and 9.6 +/- 0.5 ml/h (BFE); group B differs from others (P less than 0.05). No instance of respiratory depression or complication secondary to PCEA was observed. Mild pruritus occurred only with fentanyl-containing solutions, whereas dense motor block developed more frequently with the epinephrine-containing solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Application of the Doppler principle can provide relatively noninvasive and continuous measurement of cardiac output. However, it is based on certain assumptions that may introduce error. Esophageal Doppler cardiac output was compared with Fick cardiac output during acute blood loss (35-45% estimated blood volume) in eight anesthetized pigs. Mean Fick cardiac output decreased from 4.8 to 1.9 l/min, mean Doppler cardiac output from 4.9 to 2.9 l/min. This was accompanied by a decrease in mean arterial pressure from 119 to 55 mmHg and increase in heart rate from a mean of 115 to 156 beats/min. There was an inconsistent association between the two methods both within and between individual animals. Cubic polynomial regression equations of cardiac output with time indicated small measurement error in Fick (R2: mean 0.93, range 0.99-0.75) as opposed to Doppler (R2: mean 0.67, range 0.93-0.16) cardiac output. In one animal Doppler cardiac output showed an increase with time and in one the Doppler cardiac output measurements were unrelated to time. There was highly variable association comparing Fick versus Doppler cardiac output with correlations ranging from -0.76 to 0.98. A sign test for mean differences indicated that Doppler derived cardiac output was higher than Fick cardiac output, and the chance of this occurring if the true difference was zero was less than 1 in 1,000. A test for homogeneity of correlations was also rejected. Inaccuracies in individual assumptions in the computation of esophageal Doppler cardiac output, especially unaccounted changes in aortic diameter, are responsible for the inconsistent and unpredictable values of Doppler cardiac output obtained in this experimental model of hemorrhage.\r"

Subjects reported to City Park on a Saturday morning during the height of the grass pollen season in late spring and remained in the park for eight hours that day and on the following day. Cards were completed hourly to evaluate symptoms of allergic rhinitis and adverse experiences caused by therapy. The first three cards completed on Saturday morning were used to demonstrate that each subject had had at least minimal symptoms of allergic rhinitis and to determine baseline symptoms. Rynatan or placebo was given at noon and 7:30 PM that day and at 8:30 AM the next day. Subjects completed symptom cards hourly until 4:30 PM on Saturday, three cards that evening, and eight cards hourly the next day until 4:30 PM. The group receiving Rynatan had significantly more allergic rhinitis symptom relief than the placebo group (P = .003). More subjects in the Rynatan group (34/52) reported global symptom improvement than did subjects in the placebo group (18/52, P = .002). There were no significant severe adverse experiences and no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in incidence or severity of drowsiness, dizziness, jitteriness, headache, or nausea. We conclude that Rynatan is safe and effective in treating acute symptoms of allergic rhinitis in otherwise healthy adult subjects.\r"

This contradicts accepted doctrine on the treatment of acute urticaria. Based on theories of H1- and H2-receptor interaction at the cellular level, it has been stated that H2-blockade before H1-blockade may exacerbate symptoms. The purpose of our study was to compare diphenhydramine, an H1-blocker, with cimetidine, an H2-blocker, in a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial. Ninety-three patients presenting to the ED with clinical evidence of acute urticaria were treated with either 50 mg diphenhydramine IM or 300 mg cimetidine IM. Patients' signs and symptoms were quantitated on a numeric scale before receiving medications and 30 minutes after treatment. Parameters measured included degree of itching, intensity and extent of wheals, degree of sedation, and perception of overall improvement. Each medication provided significant relief of itching and wheal intensity (P less than .0001). Sedation was caused by both diphenhydramine (P less than .0001) and cimetidine (P less than .0006). However, the degree of sedation caused by diphenhydramine was significantly greater than that caused by cimetidine (P = .0001). The perception of overall improvement was greater with cimetidine, with 87% of patients reporting improvement, whereas 76% of diphenhydramine-treated patients reported improvement. Our results indicate that cimetidine is efficacious as the initial treatment of acute urticaria and has less tendency toward sedation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether cocaine alone would provide anesthesia equal to that of TAC, thus eliminating the risk of tetracaine toxicity and the theoretic risk of side effects from the combination of cocaine and adrenaline and simplifying preparation. One hundred thirty-nine patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind study comparing TAC with cocaine. Effectiveness was rated by the treating physician. Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, TAC was found to provide significantly better anesthesia than cocaine alone (P = .005). The percentage of patients having good anesthesia in the TAC-treated group was approximately 72%, which is equivalent to the efficacy found in other studies. Good anesthesia was obtained in 52% of the cocaine-treated group. No side effects or increased rates of infection were reported in either group.\r"

  ".U": "90120295\r", 
  ".W": "Exaggerated airway reactivity is an essential component of the current asthmatic. It is not clear, however, if airway reactivity is genetically determined or acquired. To examine the possibility that increased bronchial reactivity exists prior to the development of asthma, we report on 20 subjects who were studied before and after the onset of clinical asthma. Subjects were part of a larger on-going study of the Natural History of Asthma. Thirteen subjects indicated by their answers to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute respiratory questionnaire that they were not asthmatic at their initial visit. Seven subjects had pulmonary symptoms on their initial visit, but had not been diagnosed as asthmatic. Bronchial reactivity was assessed using a standardized methacholine challenge. For the 20 subjects, there was a mean interval of 3.5 yr between the initial visit and the diagnosis of asthma. Ten of 13 nonasthmatic subjects had moderate or strongly positive responses (208 breath units or less) to methacholine prior to onset of asthma. These 13 subjects were compared to age- and sex-matched controls, from both asthmatic and nonasthmatic families, who had not become asthmatic. There was a difference in bronchial responses at the initial visit between the 13 study subjects and their control subjects from nonasthmatic families, but not between the subjects and their controls from asthmatic families. Five of 7 subjects with pulmonary symptoms had responses of 100 breath units or less. Overall, 19 of 20 subjects had strongly positive responses to methacholine after the diagnosis of asthma was established. The results show that enhanced airway reactivity usually precedes the development of asthma, which could support a genetic basis for it.\r"

In all subjects the prestudy PC20 was less than 8 mg/ml, the postbronchodilator FEV1 was greater than 75% predicted, and skin prick tests and RAST to 13 common allergens were negative. After 2 months run-in, the subjects were randomly allocated into 3 parallel treatment groups to inhale double-blind either 4 mg nedocromil (n = 9) or 100 micrograms beclomethasone (n = 8) or placebo (n = 8) 4 times daily for 4 months. PC20 was measured using the 2-min tidal breathing method. The effect of a deep breath was measured during methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction by standardized maximal and partial expiratory flow-volume curves and was expressed as a flow ratio (M/P ratio). Pretreatment values of FEV1, PC20, and M/P ratio were not different between the 3 groups. PC20 did not change in the placebo group, but increased significantly by a factor of 3 after 8 wk of treatment with beclomethasone or nedocromil (p less than 0.001). FEV1 did not change after treatment with placebo or nedocromil (p greater than 0.2), but increased (mean change 0.2 L, SD 0.2) after 4 wk of treatment with beclomethasone (p less than 0.05). Geometric mean M/P ratio increased from 1.98 to 2.66 after 4 wk of beclomethasone (p less than 0.01), but not after nedocromil or placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The nocturnal worsening of asthma is a very common problem, yet little is known about the relationships between the nocturnal worsening and daytime lung function, methacholine bronchial responsiveness, the degree of the circadian variability in bronchial responsivity, and the nocturnal sleep pattern. This study demonstrates in 20 asthmatic patients that the overnight fall in the peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) is related to the severity of daytime airflow limitation (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001) and daytime bronchial responsiveness (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05). In individuals with larger overnight decrements in PEFR, bronchial responsivity at 0400 h is so great that normal saline inhalation alone can produce a greater than 20% fall in the FEV1. Sleep quality and sleep staging are not correlated to the change in the PEFR. Thus, the overnight decrement in asthmatic lung function is related to the daytime severity of asthma as determined by daytime measurements of airflow limitation and bronchial responsiveness as well as the circadian variation in bronchial responsivity.\r"

We studied whether this empirical role of antibiotics might not be related to a possible direct effect on respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC) secretion. The effect of erythromycin on RGC secretion and hypersecretion was studied in an in vitro preparation of human airways that were secreting [3H]glucosamine respiratory glycoconjugate (RGC), and on a human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line secreting a glycoconjugate (tumor glycoconjugate = TGC) chemically similar to the RGC secreted by the airways. Erythromycin at 10(-5) M reduced RGC secretion by 35 +/- 4% (n = 9, p less than 0.001) in both human airways and the adenocarcinoma cells, and was increasingly active in the pharmacologic range of 10(-7) to 10(-4) M. The inhibitory effect of erythromycin was maximal within 16 h and was still evident 34 h after incubation. Erythromycin was noted to reduce both spontaneous (baseline) and stimulated RGC secretion (by histamine and methacholine) from airways in culture. The blocking effect appeared to be more selective for histamine than methacholine. These effects were not associated with any toxicity to the tissues and were not associated with the inhibition of protein synthesis. Dexamethasone also inhibited RGC release in both assay systems and exhibited dose-related effects in the physiologic ranges (10(-9) to 10(-5) M). When administered together, erythromycin and dexamethasone had an additive inhibitory effect on RGC secretion (68.0 +/- 3.0%, n = 7, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Norfloxacin, an antibacterial agent, reduced the G' but not the eta' of nasal mucus. Serratiopeptidase, a proteolytic enzyme, reduced eta' but did not reduce G'. S-carboxymethylcysteine, a blocked thiol derivative of cysteine, did not change either G' or eta'. L-cysteine ethyl ester hydrochloride, a sulfhydryl type of agent, reduced both G' and eta'.

  ".W": "To investigate the possible role of mast cell histamine release in mediating adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-induced bronchoconstriction, we have measured the histamine concentration in peripheral venous plasma following inhalation of methacholine, AMP, and allergen in concentrations sufficient to provoke mean maximum decreases in FEV1 of 42.8 +/- 2.2%, 46.5 +/- 3.9%, and 40.9 +/- 4.6%, respectively, in 10 atopic, nonasthmatic subjects. Mean baseline plasma concentrations of histamine were 0.25 +/- 0.02, 0.22 +/- 0.03, and 0.29 +/- 0.03 ng/ml on the methacholine, AMP, and allergen study days, respectively. Plasma histamine did not change following methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, but increased in 9 out of 10 subjects to a mean maximum value of 0.78 +/- 0.15 ng/ml following inhalation of allergen (p less than 0.005). Following bronchial challenge with AMP, there was a significant elevation in plasma histamine in 9 out of 10 subjects to a mean maximum value of 0.39 +/- 0.03 ng/ml (p less than 0.005). We conclude that AMP-induced bronchoconstriction is associated with the enhanced release of histamine in the airways, probably from airway mast cells. However, the rise in plasma histamine, in being smaller than that occurring with a dose of allergen that provoked a similar degree of bronchoconstriction, suggests that additional mechanisms are operative in mediating the airways response to this nucleotide.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Tertiary care center at a medical research institute. PATIENTS: Sequential sample of 19 patients with active acromegaly. Twenty-five age-matched normal subjects were also studied to establish the normal range for growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). INTERVENTIONS: Eight patients (group 1) were treated with 100, 250, and 500 micrograms twice daily of octreotide, then switched to 333 micrograms three times daily, whereas 11 patients (group 2) were treated with 100, 200, 300, and 500 micrograms three times daily. Each treatment stage lasted 6 to 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Octreotide, 100 micrograms administered twice or thrice daily, significantly reduced mean 12-hour and nadir GH (P less than 0.01), IGF-1 (P less than 0.05), and hand volume (P less than 0.05). Dose increment to 500 micrograms in both groups did not further reduce mean 12-hour GH, nadir GH, or hand volume. Switching from 500 micrograms twice daily to 333 micrograms thrice daily resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) reduction of mean 12-hour GH, IGF-1, and hand volume. Normalization of mean 12-hour GH and IGF-1 occurred in 8 of 19 patients; 7 of the 8 patients had pretherapy mean 12-hour GH below 20 mIU/L. The pretherapy mean blood glucose was a significant negative predictor (r = -0.89) of the change in mean blood glucose during therapy. Gallstones were present in 9 of 18 patients after therapy. CONCLUSION: Thrice-daily was more effective than twice-daily administration of octreotide, and dose increments above 100 micrograms thrice daily did not confer additional benefit. Biochemical remission was achieved in 40% of patients and was dependent on the GH concentration at initiation of treatment. Cholelithiasis is a risk of octreotide therapy. Octreotide is effective and can be considered as a first-line therapy in patients with acromegaly with mean pretherapy GH concentrations below 20 mIU/L. In patients with mean GH over 20 mIU/L, octreotide may be used as an adjuvant to surgery or radiotherapy.\r"

Vascular imaging with ultrasound requires duplex and color flow Doppler, which combine gray-scale ultrasound and the Doppler phenomenon. High-resolution computed tomography modifies conventional computed tomography technology and results in images with higher spatial resolution. Magnetic resonance imaging applications for all areas of the body are being investigated and are replacing older roentgenographic techniques such as computed tomography, arthrography, myelography, and even angiography in a growing number of indications. With these new digital imaging modalities, image management has become an important consideration that can be addressed by picture archiving and communication systems.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing an objective medical record review with information available from hospital quality assurance records as well as risk management and litigation records. SETTING: Two metropolitan teaching hospitals in the northeastern United States. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using the litigation and risk management records as a criterion standard, we found that the medical record review had a sensitivity of 80% (93 of 116; 95% CI, 73% to 88%) for discovering adverse events and a sensitivity of 76% (51 of 67; 95% CI, 66% to 86%) for discovering negligent care. We estimated that record review of a random sample of hospitalizations across a geographic region would have even higher sensitivity (adverse-event sensitivity, 84%; negligence sensitivity, 80%). Moreover, we found that the adverse events we failed to discover led to less costly malpractice claims. A significant number of adverse events (20 of 172) among hospitalizations never gave rise to litigation or risk management investigation. Six of the twenty were due to negligent care. Quality assurance efforts at the level of the clinical departments in one hospital led to review of only 12 out of 82 risk management records. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming majority of adverse events and episodes of negligent care are discoverable with the methods we used to evaluate medical records. Quality assurance efforts using similar record review methods should be further evaluated.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized clinical trial with crossover for those failing therapy. The median follow-up was 61 months. SETTING: A private, tertiary-referral university hospital. PATIENTS: Seventy-two patients fulfilling inclusion criteria were drawn from a total of 420 patients treated during a 4.5-year interval. TREATMENTS: Endoscopic variceal sclerosis or distal splenorenal shunt. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Survival was significantly (P = 0.02) improved in patients randomly assigned to receive sclerotherapy: 13 of these 37 (35%) patients failed sclerotherapy and required surgical rescue. A survival advantage (P = 0.01) was seen in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who had this combined therapy; however, in patients with nonalcoholic cirrhosis, survival for those receiving sclerotherapy and surgical rescue was not significantly (P = 0.36) different from that of patients receiving distal splenorenal shunt. Control of variceal bleeding was significantly (P less than 0.001) better in the distal splenorenal shunt group (34 of 35 [97%] compared with 15 of 37 [41%] in the sclerotherapy group). Using death, uncontrolled rebleeding, or shunt thrombosis as the endpoints resulted in no significant difference between treatment groups. Hepatocyte function and portal perfusion were significantly better maintained in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were managed by sclerotherapy rather than shunt (P = 0.01 and P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic sclerotherapy with surgical rescue for uncontrolled bleeding is the optimum therapy for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. Survival is similar in nonalcoholic patients treated with either distal splenorenal shunt or endoscopic sclerotherapy, but shunting provides better control of variceal bleeding.\r"

STUDY SELECTION: All identified articles. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality and specific descriptive information concerning population, intervention, and outcome measurements were assessed. RESULTS of DATA SYNTHESIS: There have been few controlled, randomized trials of intravenous immunoglobulin. Available data suggest efficacy in persons with primary immune deficiency, premature infants at risk for group B streptococcus infection, patients with Kawasaki disease, transplant recipients at risk for cytomegalovirus infection, patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and selected patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Data are also favorable concerning the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in some other autoimmune disorders, but randomized trials are needed. Interesting areas for future study include the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. Risks of intravenous immunoglobulin are minimal. CONCLUSION: Intravenous immunoglobulin is safe and effective in treating several human diseases. Additional randomized trials are needed.\r"

There was cross resistance among the quinolone group of agents; however, the decrease in MIC for norB mutants was slightly lower than that of other fluoroquinolones. Cell lysis was induced with combined treatment of amifloxacin and sodium dodecyl sulfate in E. coli. The frequency of mutants spontaneously resistant to amifloxacin was extremely low in all species tested.\r"

Ten macaques naturally infected with simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome retrovirus serotype 2 (SRV-2), the etiologic agent of simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, received ddC by continuous intravenous infusion or by a daily bolus injection for 10 to 12 days. Another eight macaques that were negative for SRV-2 and antibody received ddC prophylaxis prior to challenge with virus and continued to receive ddC therapy for up to 28 days postchallenge. All monkeys treated with a continuous intravenous dose of ddC, which maintained plasma concentrations of ddC at levels known to inhibit SRV-2 in vitro, developed dose-related toxic effects, including leukopenia, anemia, lethargy, and decreased appetite. Monkeys treated with a daily bolus injection of ddC experienced more severe toxic effects than those on the continuous intravenous regimen, including exfoliative dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. At the concentrations of ddC administered, no significant inhibition of SRV-2 replication was detected in naturally infected macaques. However, a prophylactic regimen of ddC did have an inhibitory effect on SRV-2. Our findings suggest that ddC may be valuable as a short-term prophylactic treatment rather than as a long-term therapy.\r"

These enzymes had isoelectric points ranging from 5.3 to 6.5 (CAZ-1, 5.55; CAZ-2, 6.0; CAZ-3, 5.3; CAZ-6, 6.5; and CAZ-7, 6.3). All isolates and their Escherichia coli transconjugants were highly resistant to amoxicillin (MICs, greater than 4,096 micrograms/ml), piperacillin (64 to 256 micrograms/ml), cephalothin (32 to 256 micrograms/ml), and ceftazidime (32 to 512 micrograms/ml) but remained moderately susceptible to cefotaxime (0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Only CAZ-6- and CAZ-7-producing strains were highly resistant to aztreonam (64 to 128 micrograms/ml). All the isolates remained susceptible to moxalactam and imipenem. The reduced activity of piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, or aztreonam was restored by 2 micrograms of clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam, or brobactam per ml for E. coli producing CAZ-2, CAZ-3, and CAZ-7. Sulbactam had a lower protective effect than other inhibitors for E. coli harboring CAZ-1 and especially CAZ-6. Except for CAZ-1, which was mediated by a 150-kilobase (kb) plasmid (pCFF14), the other ceftazidimases were mediated by plasmids of 85 kb with EcoRI digestion patterns similar to that of pCFF04 encoding CTX-1 beta-lactamase. A TEM probe hybridized with a 19-kb EcoRI fragment of all these closely related plasmids.\r"

  ".U": "90120556\r", 
  ".W": "Mutants of Enterobacter cloacae 55 were studied to delineate more completely the genetics of inducible expression of AmpC beta-lactamase. E. cloacae 55M-L, derived by mutagenesis from a mutant with high-level cefotaxime resistance (MIC, greater than 64 micrograms/ml), E. cloacae 55M, demonstrated a novel phenotype by producing only low levels of AmpC constitutively. Neither the parental phenotype of E. cloacae 55M nor the wild-type phenotype of E. cloacae 55 could be restored in E. cloacae 55M-L by the introduction of functional ampR, ampC, or ampD genes. Cloning each of these genes from E. cloacae 55M-L confirmed the same genotype for this mutant as for its parental strain. Mutation of E. cloacae 55M-L to the E. cloacae 55M phenotype was found to occur spontaneously at a frequency of 10(-8). All such revertants demonstrated an inducible wild-type phenotype after introduction of a functional ampD. These results suggested that the E. cloacae 55M-L phenotype was due to a mutation in an as yet unrecognized gene, designated ampG. Verification of this gene was obtained by the restoration of the E. cloacae 55M phenotype in E. cloacae 55M-L by introduction of a cloned 2.9-kilobase BamHI fragment from the E. cloacae 55 chromosome. Transformation of both ampG and ampD into E. cloacae 55M-L reconstituted the inducible wild-type phenotype. These results indicate that ampG is required for the activation of ampC by AmpR. Without ampG, neither induction nor high-level expression of AmpC is possible. It is likely that the ampG gene product and AmpD together modulate the ability of AmpR to activate ampC expression.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical isolate of Escherichia coli, strain CB-134, recovered in 1986 from an abdominal abscess, exhibited resistance to penams, oxyimino-beta-lactams including broad-spectrum cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime), and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cephamycins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) and to moxalactam and imipenem. Clavulanate (2 micrograms/ml) restored the susceptibility of the strain to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. A beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.9 was detected in strain CB-134, and the corresponding gene was transferred by conjugation to E. coli together with the associated aminoglycoside resistance determinant [AAC(3)-II] and tetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfonamide resistance. The beta-lactamase efficiently hydrolyzed cefotaxime and ceftriaxone but only moderately hydrolyzed ceftazidime and was inhibited by clavulanate and sulbactam (1 microM) and by anti-TEM-1 and anti-TEM-2 sera. This extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, conferring resistance to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and aztreonam, was comparable to CTX-1 (TEM-3) but differed from it by pI. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the plasmid DNA indicated that this new enzyme was coded by pUD16, a plasmid of 220 kilobases which belongs to the Inc6 incompatibility group. Hybridization with an intragenic probe for TEM-1 revealed that this beta-lactamase derives from TEM-type beta-lactamases and hence it was named TEM-4.\r"

With combination therapy, lower doses of both DHPG and AF were often as effective as a higher dose of either agent given singly. For instance, the survival rate of murine CMV-challenged immunosuppressed mice was doubled when 4 mg of DHPG per kg and a 1:16 dilution of AF were both administered in contrast to when each was used alone. In both groups of animals, combination therapy was shown to be more effective than either therapy individually, even when initiation of therapy was delayed as long as 48 h. Such an approach holds promise for decreasing the expense associated with antibody use and the dose-related toxicity associated with DHPG use while maintaining or possibly increasing the efficacy of prophylaxis and therapy of serious CMV disease in humans.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out a study to estimate the incidence of erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) requiring hospitalization and to determine which drug therapies were associated with these reactions. We reviewed the clinical records of all patients who were hospitalized with these discharge diagnoses at Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound, Seattle, Wash, from 1972 through 1986. During this 14-year period, an average of about 260,000 persons, with demographic characteristics similar to those of the general population, received their care from GHC, and there were about 25,000 admissions to hospitals per year at the GHC hospitals. Based on International Classification of Diseases-Adapted coding, a total of 61 suspect cases of EM, SJS, or TEN were identified from the computerized hospital discharge file. Based on record review and the application of a uniform set of diagnostic criteria, a total of 37 patients (61%) were classified as having EM, SJS, or TEN. Of these, 16 cases (43%) were attributed to drugs administered to these patients prior to hospitalization. The overall incidence of hospitalization for EM, SJS, or TEN due to all causes was 4.2 per 10(6) person-years. The incidence of TEN alone due to all causes was 0.5 per 10(6) person-years. The incidence of EM, SJS, or TEN associated with drug use were 7.0, 1.8, and 9.0 per 10(6) person-years, respectively, for persons younger than 20 years of age, 20 to 64 years of age, and 65 years of age and older. Drug therapies with reaction rates in excess of 1 per 100,000 exposed individuals include phenobarbital (20 per 100,000), nitrofurantoin (7 per 100,000), sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and ampicillin (both 3 per 100,000), and amoxicillin (2 per 100,000). Overall, our data suggest that cases of EM, SJS, and TEN sufficiently severe to require hospitalization are infrequent among outpatients using well-established drug therapies. A continuing challenge is the evaluation of these severe cutaneous reactions that are associated with newly marketed or less frequently prescribed drug therapies.\r"

Using the clinical diagnosis of DLE as a positive reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity for the overall pathologic diagnosis of DLE were 55% and 42%, respectively. Statistically significant histologic factors favoring the diagnosis of DLE over SCLE in the present study were pilosebaceous atrophy, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, basement membrane thickening around the follicles, subepidermal edema, and vascular ectasia. These histologic variables were entered into a forward stepwise multivariate regression analysis to determine distinct predictors of DLE vs SCLE. This analysis showed that pilosebaceous atrophy was the only distinct significant predictor of DLE vs SCLE. These results suggest that the histologic differentiation of clinically defined DLE and SCLE cannot be established from the histologic features examined.\r"

After 5 days, an erythematous, blanching, papular, crusted eruption developed on his forehead, chest, and legs. Some lesions showed confluence and all were at the same developmental stage. Clinical diagnoses included necrotizing vasculitis and sepsis. A biopsy specimen revealed widespread noninflammatory syringometaplasia of eccrine ducts. Well-developed intercellular bridges and eosinophilic cytoplasm were seen within the metaplastic cells; apoptoses and occasional mitoses were present. This process is distinct and probably occurred secondary to direct toxic injury from the chemotherapeutic drugs. Because similar changes have occurred in patients with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis, we believe our patient represents an example of the noninflammatory end of the spectrum of chemotherapeutic eccrine gland reactions.\r"

  ".W": "While histopathologic analysis may offer some clues as to the pathogenesis of vasculitis, observations must be interpreted with caution, as there is considerable overlap in the histologic pattern. In most cases, a predominantly neutrophilic vasculitis affecting small dermal venules suggests a relatively acute, immune complex-mediated reaction. Less commonly, this histologic pattern may be seen in non-immunologically mediated processes, such as in the presence of bacterial toxins or malignant hypertension, or in more chronic disease states, such as granuloma faciale or erythema elevatum diutinum. A predominantly lymphocytic vasculitis may represent several pathogenetic mechanisms. In lesions more than 24 to 48 hours old, a lymphocytic vasculitis may represent a resolving phase of an immune complex-mediated neutrophilic vasculitis. Alternatively, this histologic pattern may be seen de novo in conditions with a presumed cell-mediated immunologic pathogenesis. Lymphocytic vasculitis may also be seen in rickettsial infections such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The pathogenesis of granulomatous vasculitis remains poorly understood and is thought to be induced by a combination of circulating immune complexes and a cell-mediated immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four male subjects with stable angina pectoris performed graded exercise tests after being exposed to either carbon monoxide (CO) or clean air in a randomized crossover double-blind experiment in which each subject acted as his own control. Subject's blood carboxyhemoglobin levels were increased from a baseline level of approximately 1.5% to 3% of saturation, post-CO exposure. Cardiographic and respiratory gas exchange data were obtained during the tests in which the subjects exercised to the point of onset of anginal pain. The goal of the study was to determine if low-level CO exposure compromised the ability of these individuals to perform work. Data were evaluated statistically using a two-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures; the factors were exposure ATMOSPHERE (clean air vs. CO) and ORDER of exposure (clean air first, CO second vs. CO first, clean air second). One-tailed tests were used, and differences were considered significant at the p less than .05 level. The time to onset of angina was reduced 6% (p = .046) after CO exposure relative to clean air. Oxygen uptake (VO2) at angina was reduced by approximately 3% (p = .04). A subgroup of individuals who exhibited depression in the ST segment of their electrocardiograph tracings showed a 12% reduction in time to onset of angina and a 20% reduction in the time to onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression; both of these findings were also statistically significant.\r"

Candida mediastinitis has a 55% mortality in the postoperative setting and a mortality of 92% among patients without a prior cardiac procedure. Although no patient survived Candida mediastinitis without surgical drainage of the mediastinum, survival was 85% among 13 patients who underwent operative mediastinal drainage. Chronic wound infection developed in 6 survivors of operative drainage without muscle flap closure, but in all patients closed with vascularized flaps, healing ultimately occurred. Aggressive surgical management with mediastinal drainage, sternal debridement, and early wound closure with vascularized flaps are essential to minimize the otherwise high morbidity and mortality of Candida mediastinitis.\r"

Platelet count decreases sharply due to temporary adhesion to the circuit. Platelets degranulate, synthesize and release thromboxane A2, and lose the ability to aggregate with adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine. These changes are also due to the loss of alpha 2-adrenergic and fibrinogen receptors. The neutrophil count decreases to a lesser extent, but neutrophils also are stimulated to secrete lactoferrin and elastase concomitant with activation of plasma kallikrein. Although lidocaine can inhibit the neutrophil activation and prostacyclin can inhibit the platelet stimulation, prostaglandin E1 appears to prevent both neutrophil and platelet alterations.\r"

We studied the anatomical pattern of bronchial arteries in 30 autopsy cases. In 28 of 30 cases (93.3%), at least one left bronchial artery arose directly from the anterior wall of the descending thoracic aorta. In 25 of the 30 cases (83.3%), at least one right bronchial artery was related to the first right intercostal artery. Injection studies showed that this right intercostobronchial artery supplies the proximal left main bronchus and carina as well as the right bronchus. We developed a technique for extracting the lungs along with the right intercostobronchial artery and a patch of aorta at its origin and applied it to 19 of the dissections. In 17 of the 19 cases studied (89.4%), the right intercostobronchial artery pedicle obtained had a length varying from 6.5 to 8.5 cm, sufficient for attachment of its origin to the ascending aorta of the recipient after double-lung transplantation. The right intercostobronchial artery pedicle provides the possibility for direct bronchial revascularization in right single-lung, double-lung, and lung-heart transplantation. A similar technique, utilizing the left bronchial artery, can be used to revascularize a left lung transplant.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-two obese subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had their plasma insulin, C peptide, and glucose levels measured after an overnight fast and in response to a 75-g oral glucose loading. Subjects were then prospectively followed up with dietary treatment, and the same measurements were repeated at 1 year. Although insulin values tended to be lower with greater fasting hyperglycemia at baseline, no correlation was observed among three parameters. However, near-normalization of glycemia (measured as the level of hemoglobin A1) was associated with significantly higher fasting and stimulated plasma insulin concentrations. Sixteen subjects were matched to each other for equivalent baseline hyperglycemia (by glycosylated hemoglobin) and divided into group 1 (normalization of the hemoglobin A1 value to 7.0% +/- 0.3% [mean +/- SE]) and group 2 (persistent hyperglycemia) (hemoglobin A1 value, 10.7% +/- 0.7% [mean +/- SE]). Before dietary therapy, the plasma insulin concentrations were twofold to threefold higher in group 1, and despite similar degrees of weight loss, group 2 failed to demonstrate improved glycemia. We concluded that the outcome of diet therapy for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is dependent on the duration of diabetes and endogenous insulin secretory reserve. There is a subgroup of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in whom delayed dietary intervention may have a beneficial effect.\r"

There were 11 technical complications, including 1 death due to misplacement of the catheter, 2 mild intraventricular hemorrhages, and 5 malfunctioning reservoirs; 3 required craniotomies (1 for subdural hematoma and 2 for subdural hygroma); 13 cases of bacterial meningitis occurred in 10 patients. One patient died of Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. The organisms causing the other infections were mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci (8 cases) or Propionibacterium acnes (2 cases). The projected infection rate for all patients (by Kaplan-Meier analysis) during the first year following insertion of a reservoir was 15%. Successful use of Ommaya reservoirs requires expert surgical implantation and meticulous care during accessing to minimize complications.\r"

Starting on the 3rd day of the trial, an outbreak was observed, and Shigella flexneri type 2a was isolated from 6 subjects. Eight of the subjects in the treatment group had diarrhea (16%) compared with 37 in the placebo group (74%), providing a 79% protection rate. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of accompanying symptoms between the subjects suffering from diarrhea in both groups, but the duration of disease was shorter in the treatment group. Serologic study of the outbreak showed no significant difference in antibody response to S flexneri between the treatment (14 of 43) and placebo (18 of 39) groups. Doxycycline prophylaxis apparently is effective and probably does not prevent subclinical infection.\r"

The infection was hospital acquired in 4 patients (36%). All patients had one or more (median, 1.5) major underlying diseases. Seven of them had previous abnormalities of the lung or pleura. Severe immunosuppression was present in 7 cases. Pneumonia occurred in 8 patients, lung abscesses in 2, and empyema in 1. All patients with pneumonia had positive blood cultures. A gastrointestinal source of pulmonary infection was not probable because only 2 patients had positive stool cultures. We suggest that the reticulo-endothelial system could be the source of hematogenous spread of nontyphoid Salmonella. The overall mortality was 63%. Pulmonary infection due to Salmonella should be considered among the pathogens associated with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in elderly patients who are immunosuppressed and have underlying pulmonary disease. Pathogenesis of this infection remains to be clarified.\r"

On the standard measurements, methotrexate-treated patients fared better than placebo-treated patients in their physical, social, and emotional function by 11%, 5%, and 6%, respectively, results that, although statistically significant, were small. However, methotrexate-treated patients were 29% better in the individualized measures, a result that was both highly statistically significant and greater than the differences in the standard measurements or in joint counts, grip strength, proximal interphalangeal joint circumference, morning stiffness, or walking time. Because the individualized measurements were as efficient as the best direct joint examination measures, yet reflected functional outcomes of greatest importance to individual patients, they constitute useful measures for such trials.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of sodium excretion with a constant sodium intake of 40 mEq/d. We also compared the effects of ibopamine with those induced by intravenous infusion of dopamine hydrochloride (3 micrograms/kg per minute) in similar patients. Ibopamine caused significant increases in urine output, glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion throughout the 4 hours of the trial in patients with basal sodium excretion rate greater than 20 mmol/d. These renal effects were associated with a significant reduction in plasma aldosterone concentration. In contrast, only a transient increase in glomerular filtration rate and a diminution in plasma aldosterone concentration were observed after ibopamine in the patients with a basal sodium excretion rate less than 20 mmol/d. The infusion of dopamine had renal effects similar to those of ibopamine in both groups of patients. These results indicate that in cirrhotic patients with normal sodium excretion, ibopamine exerts a diuretic and natriuretic effect similar to that of dopamine infusion. However, these properties of dopaminergic agents are apparently lost in patients with avid sodium retention.\r"

From July 1984 to December 1987, 65 incident AIDS cases occurred in 388 homosexual/bisexual men infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at the time of recruitment. The mean level of beta 2M in uninfected individuals at entry was 170 nmol/L. In HIV-seropositive patients who had not developed AIDS, the mean beta 2M level was 254 nmol/L, and in those who had developed AIDS, the beta 2M level was 347 nmol/L. After 36 months of follow-up, 34% of individuals with beta 2M levels greater than 322 nmol/L at entry developed AIDS, 21% of individuals with levels between 246 and 322 nmol/L developed AIDS, while only 7.3% of those with levels below 246 nmol/L developed AIDS. The beta 2M level predicted the development of AIDS independently of the CD4 lymphocyte count in HIV-seropositive individuals. Thus, 65.5% of HIV-seropositive individuals with beta 2M levels above 322 nmol/L and CD4 lymphocyte counts of below 500/microL developed AIDS in 3 years. This represents an 18.4-fold increased relative hazard at 3 years over individuals with beta 2M and CD4 cell counts within the reference range for uninfected individuals. A nomogram is provided that allows the easy calculation of the probability of an HIV-infected person developing AIDS in 36 months depending on prevalent levels of CD4 lymphocytes and serum beta 2M.\r"

A retrospective analysis was performed comparing patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia during this 18-month period with those who presented over the preceding 36 months. Most of the increased incidence was attributable to individuals hospitalized with a diagnosis of drug addiction who had concomitant soft-tissue infection, although the absolute number of hospitalized drug addicts did not change during this interval. No common or distinctive group A streptococcal serotypic patterns were discovered. This experience suggests that group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia and soft-tissue infection may present in epidemic fashion among parenteral drug addicts in the absence of a common source.\r"

The phenomenon was time-dependent up to 60 min whereas the angiotensin I generated after 120 min was virtually the same as that generated after 60 min thus indicating a possible reversible activation of human prorenin. We speculate that prorenin may be reversibly activated by contact with the lipidic portion of the cell membrane either inside or outside the cells thus allowing a limited angiotensin II-generating cascade at a local site initiated by prorenin independently from the presence of active renin.\r"

  ".U": "90122116\r", 
  ".W": "The accumulation of collagen within the myocardium is termed fibrosis. In left ventricular pressure overload a reactive interstitial fibrosis, having distinctive biochemical and structural features, is seen. This reactive fibrosis occurs in the absence of myocyte necrosis, is progressive in nature, and initially is an adaptive response that preserves the force generating capacity, or active (systolic) stiffness, of the hypertrophied myocardium. Later in hypertrophy a reparative (or replacement) fibrosis occurs in response to cell loss, the pathogenesis of which is not clear. Nevertheless, independently of cell loss, interstitial fibrosis can have a detrimental influence on the diastolic and systolic stiffness of the myocardium and can result in pathologic hypertrophy with heart failure. In established hypertrophy with disproportionate collagen matrix remodeling (ie, interstitial heart disease), it would be desirable to retard the continued formation of collagen and, if necessary, degrade collagen fibers that are responsible for impeding the stretching and shortening of muscle fibers. Prevention of interstitial fibrosis in pressure overload hypertrophy with pharmacologic agents with both antihypertensive and antifibrotic properties must also be considered. Future research should address these issues with a view toward developing corrective and preventative forms of therapy. Such advances will require a better understanding of cardiac fibroblast growth, collagen synthesis and the regulation of collagen gene expression in the heart.\r"

  ".W": "The virally encoded protease of human immunodeficiency virus is responsible for the processing of the gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors to their mature polypeptides. Since correct processing of the viral polypeptides is essential for the production of infectious virus, HIV protease represents a potential target for therapeutic agents that may prove beneficial in the treatment of AIDS. In this study, full-length gag polyprotein has been synthesized in vitro to serve as a substrate for bacterially expressed HIV-1 protease. Expression of the protease in E. coli from the lac promoter was enhanced approximately five-fold by deletion of a potential hairpin loop upstream from the codon determining the amino terminus of mature protease. Extracts of induced cultures of E. coli harboring a protease-containing plasmid served as the source of protease activity. The gag polyprotein synthesized in vitro was cleaved by such lysates, producing fragments corresponding in size to p17 plus p24 and mature p24. Immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibodies to p17 and p24 polypeptides suggest that initial cleavage of gag polyprotein occurs near the p24-p15 junction. The proteolysis was inhibited by pepstatin with an IC50 of 0.15 mM for cleavage at the p24-p15 junction and 0.02 mM for cleavage at the p17-p24 junction.\r"

In 61% of men no rev-specific antibodies were detected at all, 30% had persistently detectable rev-specific antibodies, and in 9% rev-specific antibodies were only transiently or intermittently detected. When a persistent rev-specific antibody response occurred in subjects who seroconverted to structural proteins, it was always, with one exception, found within 12 months of seroconversion. The rev-specific antibodies were also studied in a transectional sample of sera from the men who remained symptom-free and from those who developed AIDS-related conditions or AIDS, as well as in sera from 31 other men with AIDS-related conditions and in sera from 6 of these men at the time they developed AIDS. The rev-specific antibodies were found in 34% of symptom-free men, in 28% of patients with AIDS-related conditions, and in 16% of patients with AIDS. The low incidence of rev-specific antibodies early after infection may be due to low antigenicity of rev. The lower prevalence of rev-specific antibodies in sera from patients with AIDS, compared with patients with AIDS-related conditions and symptom-free HIV-1-infected individuals, may be explained by a progressive HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As a result we obtained two kinds of cDNA clones encoding LT in which amino acid residue 26t of mature LT is different; one is Asn and another is Thr. The sequence of the genomic clones obtained using a polymerase chain reaction method showed that the HUT-102 genome also contains two types of LT genes. Recombinant LTs expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited the same level of cytolytic activity against L-M cells. These results indicate that the cytotoxin constitutively produced by HUT-102 cells include two kinds of LT.\r"

Despite exposure to organic solvents and nonsolvents (diethyl phthalate, corn oil, and mineral oil) and to shear, the islets survived encapsulation. They continued to secrete insulin into the tissue culture medium and responded to glucose in both static glucose challenges and perifusion assays as well and as long as control islets which were not encapsulated, but were maintained in tissue culture alongside the encapsulated islets. Unfortunately, there was a great deal of variability in the performance of all islets studied, making unequivocal conclusions difficult. Some encapsulated islets survived more than 140 days in vitro and histologically appeared healthy. However, there appeared to be a general deterioration in insulin secretion capacity following prolonged culture in all islets, with corresponding changes (e.g., central necrosis) visible by microscopy. Although Eudragit RL is not practical as an encapsulation polymer, this study was useful in demonstrating that islets may be encapsulated in materials other than alginate-polylysine, and ultimately in materials that may have a more optimum blend of the desired properties: biocompatibility, permselectivity, and mechanical durability.\r"

Long-term experiments, in which the TAH TNS-Brno-II and VII and the Rostock hearts were implanted, are described. Long-term experiments were dedicated to analysis of specific pathophysiologic problems (venous hypertension, thrombogenesis, and calcification) in order to increase survival rates. Thrombogenesis has been partially solved in the TNS-BRNO-VII device by optimal TAH construction using an asymmetric driving diaphragm, the undulating motion of which produced excellent results. Two methods for prevention of increase in central venous pressure (CVP) are verified: administration of antihypertensive drugs and atrial electrical stimulation. Of 155 calves studied, 50 long-term experiments in calves and one in a goat were done. The survival of these animals extended from 31 to 293 days of pumping (average survival, 116.9 days). To prevent driving diaphragm calcification, we have incorporated exogenic inhibitors of calcification into the diaphragm biomaterial (polyurethane). A unique long-term experiment with intrathoracic TAH implantation in the goat is also described. In addition clinical use of the TAH as a bridge to transplantation is discussed. Parallel research with the left ventricular assist device (LVAD) system was studied experimentally, and twice used in patients. The TAH TNS-BRNO-VII/80/clin/ was used in four patients. It worked faultlessly for 22 hours to 10 days. More precise and specific indications for TAH implantation when used as a bridge to transplantation are needed.\r"

The results were compared with those obtained in the same group of ponies over the same time period on a different day with the animals conscious. Anaesthesia induced an increase in plasma concentrations of glucose, lactate, cortisol and ACTH and a decrease in plasma concentration of insulin. The response was the same when the study was repeated 18 months later. This suggests that anaesthesia alone, with a commonly used clinical technique, induced a substantial stress response in the horse.

We are convinced that the ability to adjust the wave form is a useful feature of a high frequency ventilator. As the required energy is related to (frequency) all the machines we have examined are large, heavy and noisy. Some problems could probably be overcome by engineering skill. For this reason we have not presented detailed power charts of our machines (built mostly by us). However, one has to admit that none of the devices is sophisticated enough to satisfy a physician who is not enthusiastic for high frequency ventilation. On the other hand, we have treated several patients suffering from bronchiectasis using a linear motor piston heavier than the patient. Asymmetric oscillations helped to clear the airways of purulent sputum. Despite all the noise and unsophisticated appearance of the machine, it was accepted well by the patients because they felt relief. This suggests that, regardless of all obstacles, research in HFV technology should be continued.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) at 2 and 15 Hz on the pulmonary clearance of technetium 99m diethylene triamine pentaacetate (99mTc-DTPA) were compared with conventional volume-controlled (VC) ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), in a model of respiratory failure induced by two lung lavages in adult rabbits. In group 1 the lungs were ventilated with HFJV at 2 Hz, and in group 2 ventilation was with HFJV at 15 Hz; group 3 underwent conventional VC ventilation. Group 4 also had conventional ventilation, but without previous lung lavage and functioned as a control group. In all groups, mean airway pressure was maintained at a value to ensure PaO2 greater than 25 kPa. The measured half-life time (T1/2) of the 99mTc-DTPA (mean (SD] was: group 1, 28 (7.8) min; group 2, 73.5 (7.9) min; group 3, 56.5 (12.4) min and group 4, 92.6 (13.2) min. Assuming that conventional VC with PEEP ventilation causes no additional harm to surfactant depleted lungs, it is concluded that HFJV at 2 Hz leads to further damage of the lungs, whereas HFJV at 15 Hz improves reparative processes, by keeping the lungs constantly inflated.\r"

Outcome was also similar after skin repair with either polyglycolic acid or chromic catgut or silk, although silk repair required more packets of material and was associated with delay in resuming sexual intercourse; polyglycolic acid was more likely to need removal than chromic catgut but it appeared to reduce the need for resuturing.

Derivatives of polyglycolic acid (marketed as Dexon and Vicryl) appear to be the absorbable material of choice for both deep and skin closure. Compared with catgut their use is associated with about a 40% reduction in short-term pain and need for analgesia. The main drawback is that some material often needs removal during the puerperium. Glycerol-impregnated catgut is ruled out because of its link with long-term dyspareunia. Compared with the non-absorbable materials (silk and nylon) polyglycolic acid skin sutures were associated with less short-term perineal pain, and had no clear disadvantages. Continuous, subcuticular stitching appears preferable to interrupted, transcutaneous suturing, particularly in terms of perineal pain in the early puerperium.\r"

Women who had no specific antenatal preparation and preferences regarding labour positions were managed either conventionally (semi-recumbent and lateral), or encouraged to adopt upright positions (squatting, kneeling, sitting or standing) according to individual preference. Of the women allocated to the upright position 74% completed the second stage upright, with kneeling being the most favoured position, but squatting was, despite all assistance, too difficult to maintain. Adoption of upright positions resulted in a higher rate of intact perineums. There was a clinically apparent reduction of forceps deliveries in the upright group which influenced midwives' attitudes. Moving the parturient from recumbent to upright positions was often perceived to be beneficial when there was slow progress. Estimated blood loss was similar in the two groups, as was the condition of the newborn (Apgar score and umbilical artery pH). Alternative positions in the second stage of labour, in particular kneeling, are achievable even without specific birth aids and antenatal preparation. They appear safe, acceptable to most parturients and their midwives, and are easily integrated into modern labour ward practice; they may have clinical advantages which need further investigation.\r"

Sensitivity of ultrasound to diagnose endometrial pathology was 91%, and all endometrial carcinomas, hyperplasias and pyometra were diagnosed by ultrasound. In 10 premenopausal women (group C), who had a hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, the ultrasound measurements of the endometrial wall thickness were within 1 mm of the actual thickness, as measured in the fresh unfixed specimen with a ruler. This preliminary study has shown that a normal ultrasound appearance of the endometrium in postmenopausal women reliably excludes significant endometrial pathology. Also, changes in the thickness and texture of the endometrium detected by ultrasound correlated with subsequent pathological findings.\r"

The effect is magnified in splenectomized mice, where leukocyte numbers reach 100 x 10(6) mL after 4 days' treatment at 250 micrograms/kg/d. Further hematopoietic precursor populations are also affected in both marrow and the spleen; in general, marrow parameters were depressed, while splenic populations were enlarged. In splenectomized mice, both blood-borne stem cells were enhanced, and foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis were enlarged in addition to the effects seen in intact mice. In the marrow of splenectomized and intact mice treated with a high dose of G-CSF, erythroid suppression in the marrow was confirmed with radioactive iron. Our studies confirm and extend previous work on the mode of action of G-CSF, and indicate that side effects of high dose G-CSF therapy might include erythroid suppression in the bone marrow.\r"

  ".W": "We explored the expression of a lymphocyte homing-associated cell adhesion molecule (H-CAM, CD44) on hematopoietic progenitors. We demonstrate that immature myeloid and erythroid leukemic cell lines stain intensely with monoclonal antibodies Hermes-1 and Hermes-3, which define distinct epitopes on lymphocyte surface H-CAM, a glycoprotein involved in lymphocyte interactions with endothelial cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), human marrow cells were fractionated into Hermeshi, Hermesmed, and Hermeslo populations according to the expression of both the Hermes-1 and Hermes-3 epitopes. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit and erythroid burst-forming unit precursors were found predominantly in the brightly positive fractions. Two-color FACS analysis confirmed that the My10 (CD34) positive populations of cells in bone marrow, which contain most of the progenitor cell activity, are brightly positive for Hermes-1. Finally, we demonstrate that among bone marrow cells, the highest levels of H-CAM are expressed on myeloid and erythroid progenitors as well as mature granulocytes and lymphocytes. Thus we provide evidence that molecules related or identical to the H-CAM homing receptor are expressed on marrow progenitor cells. H-CAM may contribute to progenitor cell interactions with marrow endothelial and stromal cell elements important to the maintenance and regulation of hematopoiesis.\r"

We report here that TGF-beta 1 can act directly on hematopoietic progenitors to inhibit the growth of the most primitive progenitors measurable in vitro. Highly enriched populations of hematopoietic progenitor cells were obtained by isolating lineage negative (Lin-), Thy-1-positive (Thy-1+) fresh bone marrow cells, or by isolating cells from interleukin-3 (IL-3) supplemented bone marrow cultures expressing Thy-1 antigen with the fluorescent activated cell sorter. TGF-beta 1 inhibited IL-3-induced Thy-1 expression on Thy-1-negative (Thy-1-) bone marrow cells in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 5 to 10 pmol/L. In addition, TGF-beta 1 inhibited the formation of multipotent and mixed colonies by isolated Thy-1+ cells, while single lineage granulocyte and macrophage colonies were not affected. The growth of Thy-1+ Lin- cells incubated as single cells in Terasaki plates in medium supplemented with IL-3 were inhibited by TGF-beta, demonstrating a direct inhibitory effect. Hematopoietic stem cells, which have a high proliferative potential (HPP) when responding to combinations of growth factors in vitro, have been detected in the bone marrow of normal mice and mice surviving a single injection of 5-fluorouracil. TGF-beta 1 inhibited the growth of all subpopulations of HPP colony forming cells (CFC) in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 of 5 to 10 pmol/L. Thus, TGF-beta directly inhibits the growth of the most immature hematopoietic cells measurable in vitro.\r"

  ".W": "B19 human parvovirus is the etiologic agent of transient aplastic crisis. To better understand B19 virus-induced hematopoietic suppression, we studied the host cell range of the virus using in vitro bone marrow cultures. First, B19 virus replication was examined in the presence of various purified cytokines using DNA dot blot analysis. Replication was detected only in erythropoietin-containing cultures. The other cytokines (granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], G-CSF, M-CSF, interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-2, IL-3, and IL-6) did not support virus replication, indicating the restriction of B19 virus replication to the erythroid cell lineage. Second, hematopoietic progenitor cells were serially assayed in B19-infected and uninfected bone marrow cultures. At initiation, B19 virus infection caused marked and moderate reduction in colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E) and burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) numbers, respectively, without affecting CFU-Mix and CFU-GM numbers. Interestingly, the recovery of the erythroid progenitor numbers was observed at a late stage of cultures despite the sustained reduction in erythroblasts. The cells in the bursts derived from such reappearing BFU-E did not contain the virus genome. Although infectious virus was detected in the culture supernatants, the cultured CFU-E harvested at day 5 was relatively resistant to B19 virus infection compared with the CFU-E in fresh bone marrow. These findings suggest that pluripotent stem cells escaped B19 virus infection and restored the erythroid progenitor cells later in infected cultures. We conclude that the target cells of B19 virus are in the erythroid lineage from BFU-E to erythroblasts, with susceptibility to the virus increasing along with differentiation. Furthermore, the suppression of erythropoiesis and the subsequent recovery of the erythroid progenitor numbers in B19-infected liquid cultures may be analogous in part to the clinical features of B19 virus-induced transient aplastic crisis.\r"

  ".U": "90123176\r", 
  ".W": "Bone marrow stromal cells appear to be key regulatory elements in hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. These stromal cells respond to cytokine exposure and alter their pattern of hematopoietic growth factor production, suggesting a degree of functional plasticity. We examined the effect of two cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-4, on stromal cell regulation of pre-B cell generation using the bone marrow stromal cell line, S17. Neither lymphokine potentiated pre-B cell generation in the absence of stromal cells. However, addition of either 10 U/mL rIL-1 alpha or 50 U/mL rIL-4 to cultures of bone marrow cells containing S17 cells dramatically suppressed subsequent pre-B cell formation. Preculture of S17 stromal cells with either rIL-1 or rIL-4 completely abrogated their ability to support pre-B cell generation in subsequent coculture with freshly explanted bone marrow cells. Conditioned medium from IL-1- or IL-4-treated S17 cells also suppressed pre-B-cell generation in culture. Although it is not yet known which induced stromal cell factors are responsible for failure of pre-B-cell generation in treated cultures, these data do clearly demonstrate that local levels of IL-1 and IL-4 in the hematopoietic microenvironment may play a significant role in regulation of bone marrow stromal cell function. These data also demonstrate that fibroblastic stromal cells are primary target cells that respond to cytokine concentration and affect lymphopoietic cell development.\r"

  ".U": "90123177\r", 
  ".W": "Studies of human and murine bone marrow explants have demonstrated the existence of stromal cell precursors that give rise to colonies of adherent cells in short-term cultures. Because previous data suggested that these colonies were composed of fibroblasts, the precursor cells were termed fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F). However, we have recently shown that the stromal cells which support hematopoiesis in murine long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBC) express collagen IV and laminin, markers associated with an endothelial cell lineage, but are negative for collagen I and III, markers associated with a fibroblast cell lineage. Because these conflicting results suggest major functional differences between the stromal cells observed in long-term cultures and the short-term assay, we re-examined the lineage of CFU-F-derived stromal cells. Using two-color immunofluorescence, we characterized virtually all of the cells comprising individual \"CFU-F\" colonies derived from mouse radiation chimeras. Identification of donor (hematopoietic) or host (stromal) origin was based on surface staining for strain-specific H-2 surface antigens, and, for endothelial or fibroblast properties, on cytoplasmic staining for laminin and collagen IV, or collagens I and III, respectively. The results demonstrate that a large proportion of the cells in CFU-F colonies are donor-derived and fail to stain with any of the antisera specific for nonhematopoietic cells. In addition, these donor-derived cells exhibit marked phagocytic capacity and stain positively with monoclonal antibodies characteristic of the monocyte-macrophage hematopoietic cell lineage (anti-T200, anti-Mac-1, F4/80). However, the remainder of the cells are host-derived cells that stain positively with antisera to collagen IV and laminin. In contrast, stains for collagen types I and III were negative under conditions that allowed for strong staining of control skin fibroblasts. In separate studies, using mixtures of two genetically distinct bone marrows, the cells expressing collagen IV were further shown to be clonal in origin within individual colonies, directly demonstrating that the CFU-F assay provides a quantitative measure of the numbers of marrow stromal cell precursors. Thus, the current studies establish a remarkable similarity between the hematopoietic microenvironment in the short-term CFU-F assay and the long-term culture system: the majority of adherent cells are hematopoietic cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, while the remainder are stromal cells whose precise lineage remains uncertain, but whose pattern of collagen expression is more consistent with an endothelial rather than a fibroblast cell origin.\r"

  ".W": "Human recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) was studied for its effects on myeloid progenitor cells from normal and leukemic bone marrow cells in the presence and absence of additional growth factors. IL-4 itself did not support myeloid cluster or colony formation (CFU-GM). However, cultures supplied with IL-4 (300 U/mL) and IL-3 demonstrated a significant decline in myeloid colony numbers (CFU-GM) compared with the effects of IL-3 alone: (48 +/- 27 v 88 +/- 27 CFU-GM/10(5) MNC). In contrast, IL-4 augmented the G-CSF-supported CFU-GM: (80 +/- 31 v 148 +/- 52 CFU-GM/10(5) MNC). The effects of IL-4 were not mediated by accessory cells because similar results were obtained with and without T-cell, B-cell, or adherent depleted cell fractions. Morphologic analysis of clusters (day 7) and the colonies (day 14) demonstrated that IL-4 enhanced myeloid colony formation in the presence of G-CSF, whereas the cultures supplied with IL-3 and IL-4 did not show a lineage-restricted decline of CFU-GM. A heterogeneity in growth response was observed in the leukemic counterpart. With the 3H-thymidine proliferation assay, IL-4 augmented the G-CSF-induced proliferation of acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells in 4 of the 12 cases, while the IL-3-supported proliferation was antagonized in 3 of the 12 cases. In the blast colony assay, IL-4 suppressed the IL-3-supported AML-CFU in the majority of cases, but enhanced the G-CSF stimulated AML-CFU in 3 of 6 cases. These data demonstrate divergent effects of IL-4 on the normal myeloid progenitor cell in the presence of IL-3 or G-CSF, while a variability in responsiveness is observed in the leukemic counterpart.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo radioprotective effects of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in lethally irradiated BALB/c mice. We initially analyzed the effects of increasing doses of rhG-CSF on survival of mice receiving 700 cGy (LD100/30) single dose total body irradiation (TBI). While 1 microgram/kg to 100 micrograms/kg doses of rhG-CSF were not radioprotective, a dose-dependent radioprotection was observed at 200 micrograms/kg to 4,000 micrograms/kg rhG-CSF. We next compared four different rhG-CSF treatment regimens side by side for their radioprotective effects in LD100/30 irradiated mice. One hundred percent of control mice receiving phosphate buffered saline died within 21 days after TBI with a median survival of 14 days. The median survival was prolonged to 20 days and the actuarial 60-day survival rate was increased to 27% when mice received 2,000 micrograms/kg rhG-CSF 24 hours before TBI (P = .0002; Mantel-Peto-Cox). Similarly, the median survival time was prolonged to 24 days and the actuarial 60-day survival rate was increased to 33%, when mice were given 2,000 micrograms/kg rhG-CSF 30 minutes before TBI. Optimal radioprotection was achieved when 2,000 micrograms/kg rhG-CSF was administered in two divided doses of 1,000 micrograms/kg given 24 hours before and 1,000 micrograms/kg given 30 minutes before TBI. This regimen prolonged the median survival time of LD100/30 irradiated mice to more than 60 days and increased the actuarial 60-day survival rate to 62% (P = .0001; Mantel-Peto-Cox). By comparison, no survival advantage was observed when mice received rhG-CSF 24 hours post-TBI. Similar radioprotective effects were observed when mice were irradiated with 650 cGy (LD80/30). The presented findings provide conclusive evidence that rhG-CSF has significant in vivo radioprotective effects for mice receiving LD100/30 or LD80/30 TBI.\r"

One of 16 cell lines examined, the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) line HSB-2, lacked the 110-Kd RB protein. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA extracted from HSB-2 cells showed a large homozygous deletion of the RB gene, stretching from exon 18 beyond exon 27. Northern blot analysis showed multiple, abnormal RB transcripts in HSB-2. A truncated protein (72 Kd) was detected with 35S-methionine labeling but not with 32P-orthophosphate labeling of the HSB-2 cells. The genomic deletion of greater than 85 kb DNA at the RB locus (13q14) was not detectable in the karyotype of the HSB-2 cells. Among the 16 human leukemia cell lines examined for the status of the RB gene, only one, the HSB-2 line, showed an abnormal RB protein. Further study of primary leukemia and lymphoma samples appears to be warranted.\r"

Median survival was 11.74 and 10.03 months, respectively, without statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients. The toxicity was acceptable and no treatment-related death occurred in either treatment schedule.

  ".W": "This prospectively randomized clinical trial was carried out in four Dutch hospitals to reduce the development of metachronous liver metastases and to get a better survival in patients with colorectal malignancies after surgically radical en bloc resection of the primary tumor and the regional lymph nodes. Three hundred seventeen patients were randomized to participate in three trial arms. One group of patients was treated by surgery alone (control group); in the other patients a catheter was placed in the dilated umbilical vein and advanced until the tip was lying in the left branch of the portal vein. Fifty percent of these patients got immediate postoperative portal infusion with 1 g 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5000 U heparin daily for 7 days; the others received portal vein infusion with urokinase 10.000 U/hour for 24 hours only. Three hundred four patients were eligible. Overall hospital mortality was 3.6% (11 patients) and was not influenced by adjuvant treatment. After a median follow-up of 44 months 66 patients have died with relapse and 21 as a result of other causes. The chance of developing liver metastases and other distant metastases after portal infusion with 5-FU/heparin was one third of the chance in the control group (P less than 0.001). Only an insignificant reduction of the average death rate in the 5-FU/heparin group was found. In the urokinase group no significant effect in reducing metastases or in survival was noted. Before recommending cytotoxic portal infusion as an adjuvant treatment in patients with colorectal cancer, detailed analysis of other ongoing portal infusion studies has to be awaited and careful calculations have to be made regarding how many patients really can be saved by this treatment.\r"

This study examined several compounds for their effects on experimental hepatic metastasis and on human pancreatic tumor cell-platelet interactions. Prostacyclin (PGI2) and forskolin (stimulators of platelet adenylate cyclase) and ketoconazole (inhibitor of lipoxygenese and thromboxane synthetase) were used in order to investigate their effects on hepatic metastases from a human pancreatic tumor cell (RWP-2) in the nude mouse. The tumor cells were injected intrasplenically and the animals were divided into control, prostacyclin (PGI2 200 micrograms), forskolin (150 micrograms), and ketoconazole (180 micrograms) groups. All three drugs were administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before and 24 hours after the tumor cell injections. Statistically significant differences were observed between control and treated groups in tumor surface area (P less than 0.001), percentage of liver surface area occupied by tumor (P less than 0.001), and number of tumor colonies (P less than 0.004 for prostacyclin, P less than 0.005 for forskolin, and P less than 0.001 for ketoconazole). These agents also strongly inhibited RWP-2-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma.\r"

Sixty-one cases have now been reported in the world's literature. This lymphoma affects women more frequently than men, and typically involves the superior portions of the lungs. Radiologically, it appears as a solitary mass or multinodular disease; inhomogeneity or cavitation of these lesions are common. Since the presentation of this disease is nonspecific, and as noninvasive tests are rarely revealing, diagnosis requires an open thoracotomy and lung biopsy. Factors which correlate with a poorer prognosis include \"B\" symptoms, bilateral disease, multilobe involvement, penetration of the pleura, and cavitation. The staging and treatment of these lymphomas according to the extent of pulmonary involvement are recommended, as radiotherapy or combination chemotherapy may be effective in appropriately selected patients.\r"

Patients included in this investigation were all asymptomatic and had no known pelvic abnormalities. Each ovary was measured in three planes and ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula. The upper limit of normal for ovarian volume was 18 cm3 in premenopausal women and 8 cm3 in postmenopausal women. In patients with normal scans, mean ovarian volumes decreased from 6.8 cm3 to 3.0 cm3 with menopause. Thirty-one patients (3.1%) had abnormal vaginal sonograms and 24 underwent exploratory laparotomy. All patients undergoing surgery had ovarian or fallopian tube tumors with dimensions identical to those predicted by ultrasound. Histologic diagnoses of these tumors included the following: adenocarcinoma, one, serous cystadenoma, eight; endometrioma, six; and cystic teratomas, two. Vaginal sonography was performed easily and without complications, and was well accepted by patients. All patients with normal sonograms have been rescreened annually and none have subsequently developed ovarian cancer. Further clinical trials to determine the efficacy of vaginal sonography as a screening method for ovarian cancer are indicated.\r"

All the clinical A2 radical prostatectomies contained residual tumor with 26% having capsular penetration. Clinical Stage A2 tumors were much more heterogeneous than clinical Stage B tumors with respect to tumor location, grade, and amount. In particular, many clinical A2 cases were predominantly central or central and anterior in location (59%) and low-grade compared with clinical Stage B cases where most lesions were posterior, peripheral, and intermediate grade. Percent of tumor in TUR best predicted final pathologic stage versus TUR grade or volume. Despite statistically significant correlations between tumor percent and/or grade on TUR and final stage, predictability of final stage for individual patients from TUR data was poor. The complex interrelation of tumor location, grade, and amount resulted in wide and overlapping ranges for these parameters for organ-confined and nonconfined cases.\r"

Thirty-three cases of typhlitis were identified in patients with acute leukemia and two cases each in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma and aplastic anemia. Patients ranged in age from 10 months to 17 years. Fifty-seven percent were male and 43% were female. All were myelosuppressed. A postmortem incidence rate of 24% was determined for patients with acute leukemia. Common symptoms included abdominal pain and distention in 78% of patients and acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in 35%. Abdominal radiographs varied in spectrum from a nonspecific bowel gas pattern to frank right colonic pneumatosis intestinalis. Thirty-three patients received chemotherapy within 30 days before onset of abdominal symptoms. All patients were febrile (greater than 38.5 degrees C), and 33 received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Three patients received amphotericin B. Premortem, 84% of organisms cultured from blood were bacterial whereas 16% were fungal. Fungal pathogens accounted for 53% of new microorganisms seen at autopsy. Postmortem examination showed typhlitis in the following anatomic distributions: (1) confined to the cecum; (2) involving the cecum and ileum; (3) involving the cecum, ileum, and ascending colon; or (4) involving the cecum, with sporadic ulcers throughout the intestine. This review includes clinical and postmortem features of typhlitis and current strategies for diagnosis and management.\r"

Epidermal growth factor was stained in the cytoplasm of the cancer cells, being detected in 16 (50%) of the 32 surgical specimens and in all of the cell lines. Seven (44%) of the sixteen EGF-positive surgical specimens and one (6%) of the 16 EGF-negative ones were tumorigenic in nude mice. All of the xenografts in nude mice were positive for EGF. The tumorigenicity of human gastric cancer xenografts in nude mice may, therefore, be correlated with the presence of EGF in cancer cells.\r"

  ".U": "90124417\r", 
  ".W": "It seems established that hypertension, to some degree, is a frequent consequence of cardiac transplantation. The hypertension occurs de novo and is not related to whether hypertension was present in association with the heart disease that led to the need for transplantation. The etiology of this hypertension is multifactorial and varies depending on the time that has ensued after transplantation. Acutely, it is primarily a problem related to intravascular volume expansion and persistently increased systemic vascular resistance. Although it may be modest in severity, it seems to be particularly resistant to therapy with most antihypertensive drugs. Moreover, the total \"hyperbaric impact\" of the hypertension is rendered greater because the blood pressure and heart rate in these patients with denervated hearts fails to show the usual 10 to 15 percent fall when recumbent/asleep at night, which occurs in normotensive individuals and in most with hypertension of other etiologies. The major factor in the persistence of the hypertension through the later stages post-transplantation appears to be the cyclosporine that is used as an immunosuppressive. Although cyclosporine has been the major contributor to reduced rejection in these individuals, and to their increasingly prolonged survival, it inevitably produces slowly progressive impairment of renal function. The damage to the kidney is reflected both in tubular as well as glomerular and vascular damage, with a steady fall in glomerular filtration and a rise in creatinine. From our studies it appears that the renal alterations are associated with a gradual rise in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II, which perhaps further damages the kidney and causes persistence of the increased systemic vascular resistance. The use of lower doses of cyclosporine during the ischemic phase in the kidney that immediately follows surgery and of reduced doses over time, often with azathioprine added, seems to minimize the renal damage, or at least to stabilize it and to slow progression of the renal dysfunction and hypertension. Treatment of the hypertension with conventional drugs has definite but limited value. Diuretics and vasodilators have been the mainstay of our approach during the early phases of the hypertension but our recent data indicate that ACE inhibitors may become relatively specific in management during the later phases of the post-transplantation period as PRA levels rise in response to vascular damage by cyclosporine. ACE inhibitors have inherent dangers that require careful monitoring.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It appears that for the majority of transplant patients we have simply bought some time.

Clearly, this issue now looms as a major stumbling block toward improving long-term survival. It is no longer enough to simply perform the procedure and submit the patient to the rigors of transplantation, only to obtain 50 percent 5-year survival. We must pay particular attention to the patient postoperatively and make those modifications necessary to improve the individual's risk profile. Moreover, we must continue to concentrate our research efforts on interventions in accelerated coronary disease.\r"

Despite the improvements that have led to the successful application of cardiac transplantation, there are important limitations in our understanding and ability to manipulate the immune-mediated rejection of the donor heart by the host. Methods that allow for improved preservation of the donor heart are necessary to provide the opportunity to match more carefully the donor and recipient for histocompatibility antigens that stimulate rejection of the graft. Clinical data in humans and experimental studies in animals demonstrate that the rejection of the heart is stimulated by a wide variety of histocompatibility antigens, many of which may be neutralized by donor-recipient matching. The immunologic mechanisms that influence the survival of the graft include (1) hyperacute rejection of the graft by recipient antibody directed against foreign antigens of the donor heart, (2) T lymphocyte-mediated acute cellular rejection of the graft, and (3) chronic rejection of the graft associated with the emergence of cardiac graft arteriosclerosis in otherwise successful long-term graft recipients. An increased understanding of these processes will provide opportunities to improve cardiac transplant outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial hypertrophy can result in increased sensitivity toward the development of mechanical dysfunction during hypoxia. Alterations in glycolytic metabolism may contribute to this. We studied the response to 15 minutes of hypoxia in hypertrophied (deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension model) and nonhypertrophied rat hearts and examined the influence of a high glucose (27.5 mM) and insulin (100 mU/ml) concentration. In response to hypoxia in the presence of a normal glucose concentration (5.5 mM), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was higher in hypertrophied than in nonhypertrophied hearts (65 +/- 6 vs. 44 +/- 4 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Perfusion with high glucose and insulin blunted the rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in both hypertrophied and nonhypertrophied hearts and abolished the difference in diastolic dysfunction between groups during hypoxia (26 +/- 2 vs. 32 +/- 4 mm Hg, respectively; p = NS). At end hypoxia in the presence of a normal glucose concentration, developed pressure was more depressed in hypertrophied than in nonhypertrophied hearts (11 +/- 1 vs. 18 +/- 1% of baseline, respectively; p less than 0.05). Perfusion with high glucose and insulin resulted in improved function in both groups during hypoxia such that a greater impairment of developed pressure was no longer present in the hypertrophied versus nonhypertrophied hearts (21 +/- 1 vs. 24 +/- 2% of baseline, respectively; p = NS). At the end of hypoxic perfusion in the presence of a normal glucose concentration, hypertrophied hearts were producing 38% less lactate than nonhypertrophied hearts. Perfusion with high glucose and insulin increased lactate production in both groups and equalized lactate production between groups. Thus, the greater deterioration in hemodynamic function in hypertrophied hearts compared with nonhypertrophied hearts during hypoxia is associated with lower lactate production. Both the exaggerated hemodynamic dysfunction and deficient lactate production can be ameliorated by perfusion with a high glucose concentration and insulin.\r"

  ".U": "90124905\r", 
  ".W": "In cultured cells and isolated perfused organs, catecholamines are coreleased with chromogranin A (CgA) from adrenal chromaffin cells and sympathetic neurons. The corelease suggests that exocytosis is the mechanism of catecholamine secretion. To investigate whether physiologic catecholamine secretion is exocytotic in humans, we measured plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and CgA responses to differentiated stimuli of sympathoadrenal discharge. The CgA radioimmunoassay antibody recognized authentic CgA in normal human adrenal chromaffin vesicles. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia and caffeine ingestion, in decreasing order of potency, selectively stimulated epinephrine release from the adrenal medulla. During hypoglycemia, plasma levels of epinephrine and CgA rose, and peak plasma levels of epinephrine and CgA correlated, suggesting that gradations in epinephrine release represented gradations in exocytosis. However, significant increments in plasma CgA were not observed after caffeine ingestion. Furthermore, the rise of CgA levels during hypoglycemia lagged 60 minutes behind those of epinephrine. A less-pronounced temporal dissociation between CgA and epinephrine release was also shown in isolated chromaffin cells in vitro. Selective adrenal vein catheterization suggested a barrier to CgA transport across the adrenal capillary wall. Short-term, high-intensity dynamic exercise, assumption of the upright posture, prolonged low-intensity dynamic exercise, and smoking, in decreasing order of potency, stimulated norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings. Only the first sympathetic neuronal stimulus resulted in significant increments in plasma CgA, increments considerably less than those attained during adrenal medullary activation by insulin hypoglycemia. During high-intensity exercise, peak plasma norepinephrine and CgA levels correlated, suggesting that gradations in norepinephrine release represented gradations in exocytosis. The human adrenal medulla was a far more prominent tissue source of CgA than human sympathetic nerves--adrenal medullary homogenates contained 97-fold more CgA (micrograms/g) than sympathetic nerve homogenates. In conclusion, catecholamine secretion during selective stimulation of either sympathetic nerves or the adrenal medulla is, at least in part, exocytotic. Furthermore, stimulation of the former results in comparatively modest changes in plasma CgA compared with changes attained during stimulation of the latter. CgA appears to be transported by a route different from that of catecholamines from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells to the circulation in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90124913\r", 
  ".W": "Previous investigations have shown that the size of a regurgitant jet as assessed by color Doppler flow mapping is independently affected by the flow rate and velocity (or driving pressure) of the jet. Fluid dynamics theory predicts that jet momentum (given by the orifice flow rate multiplied by velocity) should best predict the appearance of the jet in the receiving chamber and also that this momentum should remain constant throughout the jet. To test this hypothesis, we measured jet area versus driving pressure, flow rate, velocity, orifice area, and momentum and showed that momentum is the optimal jet parameter: jet area = 1.25 (momentum).28, r = 0.989, p less than 0.0001. However, the very curvilinear nature of this function indicated that chamber constraint strongly affected jet area, which limited the ability to predict jet momentum from observed jet area. To circumvent this limitation, we analyzed the velocities per se within the Doppler flow map. For jets formed by 1-81-mm Hg driving pressure through 0.005-0.5-cm2 orifices, the velocity distribution confirmed the fluid dynamic prediction: Gaussian (bell-shaped) profiles across the jet at each level with the centerline velocity decaying inversely with distance from the orifice. Furthermore, momentum was calculated directly from the flow maps, which was relatively constant within the jet and in good agreement with the known jet momentum at the orifice (r = 0.99). Finally, the measured momentum was divided by orifice velocity to yield an accurate estimate of the orifice flow rate (r = 0.99). Momentum was also divided by the square of velocity to yield effective orifice area (r = 0.84). We conclude that momentum is the single jet parameter that best predicts the color area displayed by Doppler flow mapping. Momentum can be measured directly from the velocities within the flow map, and when combined with orifice velocity, momentum provides an accurate estimate of flow rate and orifice area.\r"

This agent produced an 18% increase in cardiac output (p less than 0.05) and 13% decrease in systemic vascular resistance in the severely damaged rats, both changes being significantly different from those seen in the normal controls or the rats with limited infarcts. All animals exhibited increases in urinary output of 4-10-fold over baseline.

Sixteen patients with presumptive diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were ultrasonically studied by means of an M-mode-based echocardiographic system with quantitative integrated backscatter analysis capabilities. A 2.25-MHz transducer was used. The integrated value of the rectified radiofrequency signal of the interventricular septum was taken as integrated backscatter index and expressed in percent normalized for the pericardial interface (assumed to be 100%). All patients also underwent multiple left ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, which were stained with Masson's trichrome and studied with the use of a computer-assisted image analysis system. The percent integrated backscatter index was significantly higher in the presence of connective tissue area greater than 20% (eight patients) versus less than 20% (eight patients): 51 +/- 25% versus 26 +/- 11%, p less than 0.05. A significant correlation (p less than 0.05, R = 0.55) was found between percent integrated backscatter index and percent connective tissue area. In vivo on-line quantitative ultrasound analysis is feasible in man and reliably identifies variations in the regional extent of fibrosis in human myocardium.\r"

Global angiographic change, including both native coronary arteries and bypass grafts after 2 treatment years, was the end point. Risk factors included on-trial clinical measures, plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. Univariate analysis indicated that risk factors previously observed by others in epidemiologic investigation of ischemic heart disease--total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, and diastolic blood pressure--had significant effects in the placebo-treated group. Univariate analysis indicated significant effects of apolipoprotein C-III in drug- and placebo-treated groups. Multivariate analysis indicated the predominant risk factor predicting the probability of global coronary progression was non-HDL cholesterol in placebo-treated subjects and the content of apolipoprotein C-III in high density lipoproteins of drug-treated subjects. Both drug- and placebo-treated group findings point to an important role for triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in progression and regression of human atherosclerosis.\r"

In studies in 16 additional fetuses, inferior vena cava Doppler velocity waveforms were compared with superior vena cava Doppler velocity waveforms. Peak velocities and time-velocity integrals of forward or reverse flow during systole, early diastole, and atrial contraction were measured. In addition, the time-velocity integral during flow coincident with atrial contraction (a wave) was expressed as a percent of the time-velocity integral of total forward flow during both systole and early diastole. Systolic-to-diastolic ratios of inferior vena cava forward time-velocity integrals were not significantly different from systolic-to-diastolic ratios of superior vena cava forward time-velocity integrals (p = 0.86), but the percent of blood moving in a reverse direction during atrial contraction in the inferior vena cava was greater than the percent of blood moving in a reverse direction in the superior vena cava (p less than 0.05). Relative forward flow in early diastole in the group of normal fetuses increased with advancing gestational age (r = 0.60, p less than 0.05).

Among the 540 patients enrolled in the trial, no pattern could be found at these intervals either, although at 8-hour intervals, 27% of infarctions occurred between midnight and 8:00 AM, compared with 37% between 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM and 36% between 4:00 PM and 12:00 AM (p = 0.02). In contrast to the patterns previously noted for Q wave myocardial infarction, there was no preponderance of non-Q wave infarction in the late morning. Circadian rhythm was also absent among patients not treated with beta-blockers as well as among patients presenting with ST segment elevation on their enrollment electrocardiograms. Diabetics, women, and patients with first infarction were more likely to present during the afternoon hours. We conclude that the late morning preponderance seen for Q-wave myocardial infarction is not discernable in patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction. This observation suggests that the pathogenesis of these two infarct subtypes is different or that the process of thrombotic coronary occlusion in Q wave infarction (sustained) differs from that in non-Q wave infarction (nonsustained).\r"

To evaluate the benefit of exercise training as a treatment for patients with PAD, as well as possible mechanisms associated with improvement, we randomly assigned 19 men with disabling claudication to treated and control groups. Treatment consisted of supervised treadmill walking (1 hr/day, 3 days/wk, for 12 weeks) with progressive increases in speed and grade as tolerated. Graded treadmill testing was performed to maximal toleration of claudication pain on entry and after 12 weeks of training to define changes in peak exercise performance. After 12 weeks, treated subjects had increased their peak walking time 123%, peak oxygen consumption 30%, and pain-free walking time 165% (all p less than 0.05). Control subjects had no change in peak oxygen consumption, but after 12 weeks, peak walking time increased 20% (p less than 0.05). In treated subjects, maximal calf blood flow (measured by a plethysmograph) increased 38 +/- 45% (p less than 0.05), but the change in flow was not correlated to the increase in peak walking time.

  ".W": "We compared left ventricle (LV) volume (V) simultaneously measured using the conductance catheter (VM) with volume calculated from three LV dimensions (VD) determined ultrasonically from endocardial crystals. Seven adult mongrel dogs (20-30 kg) were anesthetized and instrumented to measure micromanometer LV pressure and V. Three pairs of crystals were placed orthogonally in subendocardial positions and a conductance catheter was placed in the LV retrograde across the aortic valve. Under steady-state conditions, over the range of a single cardiac cycle, the relation between VM and VD was well described by a straight line. There was an excellent correlation of conductance and dimension volumes with r equal to 0.97 +/- 0.04 and SEE 0.8 +/- 0.5 ml. The gain (1/alpha) and parallel conductance volume (alpha VC) were constant. At lower volumes obtained during bicaval occlusion, however, the relation between VM and VD was curvilinear. 1/alpha and alpha VC both decreased as LVV fell. Thus, determination of absolute volume using the conductance catheter depended on the conditions under which the data were obtained. Under steady-state conditions, alpha VC calculated by both the saline method (mean +/- SD, 50 +/- 15 ml) and by regression of VM and VD, (45 +/- 21 ml) were similar. Consequently, absolute LV end-diastolic volumes and end-systolic volumes by the conductance and dimension methods were similar (53 +/- 14 ml and 38 +/- 14 ml vs. 56 +/- 17 ml and 44 +/- 16 ml, respectively, p = NS). When volume decreased during bicaval occlusion, there was a progressively greater decrease in VM as compared with VD. The absolute slope (EES) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) was consistently higher by the dimension method, group average, 16.3 +/- 7.6, than by the catheter, 8.5 +/- 5.9, p less than 0.05. The direction and magnitude of the change in EES at different inotropic states (autonomic blockade; dobutamine), however, was similarly measured by both the conductance catheter and dimension method. We conclude that the gain and offset of the conductance catheter are relatively constant at steady state but vary when volume is reduced by caval occlusion. Thus, the conductance catheter accurately measures absolute volumes at steady state but can underestimate the slope and position of the ESPVR when it is determined by caval occlusion. The conductance catheter does, however, accurately measure the directions and magnitude of change in contractile state.\r"

Recent technical advances have permitted fabrication of a small (1.83 mm), phased-array, intravascular ultrasonic imaging catheter capable of continuous real-time, cross-sectional imaging of blood vessels. We used this imaging catheter to compare intraluminal ultrasound with cineangiography in the measurement of vascular dimensions in animals and to assess the intraobserver and interobserver variability of the technique. Segmental deformation of vessel anatomy was produced by stenoses created with a tissue ligature or by balloon dilation. The mean value for measurements of vessel diameter was 5.6 mm by cineangiography and 5.7 mm by intravascular ultrasound. The correlation between cineangiography and ultrasound was close (r = 0.98). Mean cross-sectional area by angiography was 28.8 mm2 and 29.6 mm2 (r = 0.96) by ultrasound. Percent diameter reduction produced by the stenoses averaged 48.4% by cineangiography and 40.1% by ultrasound, and the two methods correlated closely (r = 0.89). Correlation between cineangiography and ultrasound for vessel diameter and area before balloon dilation was closer (r = 0.92 and 0.88) than after balloon dilation (r = 0.86 and 0.81). This difference reflected an increase in measured vessel eccentricity following balloon dilation. These data demonstrate that intravascular ultrasound is an accurate and reproducible method for measurement of vascular diameter and cross-sectional area in vivo. Intravascular ultrasound is capable of accurately identifying and quantifying segmental deformation of vascular dimensions produced by either stenoses or balloon dilation.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the manner in which changes in diastolic performance can contribute to the effect of vasodilation in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, we examined the effect of acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with intravenous enalaprilat on early LV diastolic filling. We studied 43 patients with congestive heart failure and depressed LV systolic function (mean ejection fraction +/- SD, 0.24 +/- 0.06), performing radionuclide ventriculography before and after administration of 1.25 mg intravenous enalaprilat. We measured the effect of enalaprilat on the maximum rate of early LV diastolic filling normalized in four different ways and related these changes to both LV and right ventricular (RV) volumes. Enalaprilat induced a small but statistically significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume and increase in LV ejection fraction. For the entire patient group, there was no significant change in LV peak filling rate after enalaprilat administration. For individual patients, however, the effect of enalaprilat on peak filling rate was related to resting RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. In patients with enlarged RV end-diastolic volumes (greater than or equal to 120 ml/m2), mean peak filling rate increased from 1.38 +/- 0.6 to 1.71 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic volumes (EDV)/sec and from 244 +/- 131 to 297 +/- 162 ml/sec/m2 after enalaprilat administration, whereas no change in mean peak filling rate was observed in patients with nondilated RVs. These observations were present regardless of the method of normalizing peak filling rate. Thus, the response of LV peak filling rate to enalaprilat is influenced by the presence of RV dilatation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Myocardial ischemia and increased calcium loading have been implicated in the genesis of increased left ventricular stiffness. We have assessed the effects of long-term therapy with different classes of calcium channel-blocking drugs on left ventricular peak filling rate in patients with chronic stable angina and congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic heart disease. Therapeutic effects of nicardipine (30 mg t.i.d.), nisoldipine (10 mg b.i.d.), and verapamil (120 mg t.i.d.) (4 weeks) have been assessed on radionuclide left ventricular diastolic filling parameters in patients with chronic stable angina using placebo-controlled studies. All three drugs significantly improved exercise capacity as compared with placebo. Verapamil produced significant improvements in peak filling rate (p less than 0.005), time to peak filling rate (p less than 0.01), and first one-third filling fraction (p less than 0.005), whereas nicardipine only improved peak filling rate (p less than 0.005); neither drug altered the mean ejection fraction (n = 20). Nisoldipine did not significantly alter diastolic filling parameters or ejection fraction (n = 10). Nisoldipine and digoxin were also assessed in congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] classes II and III) associated with ischemic heart disease (n = 26) (open parallel design). Neither produced significant alterations in peak filling rate and ejection fraction after 3 months of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Asymptomatic ST segment shifts during ambulatory 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring and exercise treadmill testing are far more frequent than symptomatic ST shifts and are associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion as assessed by radionuclide scintigraphy. Seemingly healthy asymptomatic patients and patients with stable coronary artery disease, unstable angina, or recent myocardial infarction are all at higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity if there is evidence of silent ischemia. Hemodynamic studies have clearly documented the adverse effects of ischemia on left ventricular systolic function. Furthermore, diastolic relaxation and filling appear to be altered by both symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemia during atrial pacing and dynamic exercise independent of changes in systolic function. The majority of patients with coronary artery disease have abnormal diastolic parameters at rest, regardless of anginal symptoms, which are partially reversible after coronary revascularization procedures such as angioplasty and bypass surgery. Regional diastolic dysfunction from scar or ischemia can lead to asynchronous myocardial relaxation and thus affect global diastolic function, depending on the extent and severity of the regional abnormalities. Diastolic function seems more susceptible to ischemia than systolic function and can take longer to recover.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Most research in the field of chronic heart failure during the last 20 years has been directed toward defining and understanding the abnormalities of systolic function seen in this disorder, but systolic performance is not a determinant of effort tolerance. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest a strong relation between exercise capacity and abnormalities of diastolic function in chronic heart failure. Of all the commonly measured hemodynamic variables, effort tolerance (whether limited by dyspnea or fatigue) varies more closely with the level of left ventricular filling pressure than the left ventricular ejection fraction. Consequently, drugs that lower ventricular filling pressures are more likely to enhance exercise capacity than drugs that primarily increase cardiac output and left ventricular ejection phase indexes. Vasodilator drugs do not reduce left ventricular filling pressure, however, by simply redistributing central blood volume to the peripheral capacitance circuits because these agents do not predictably decrease left ventricular volumes. Instead, clinically effective drugs seem to reduce left ventricular filling pressure primarily by producing a favorable shift in the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation. Conversely, agents that adversely affect the diastolic pressure-volume relation frequently cause clinical deterioration. These findings suggest that abnormalities of diastolic rather than systolic performance may be the most important determinants of the clinical status and exercise intolerance of patients with chronic heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system becomes activated in heart failure, and while this is initially beneficial, the consequences of prolonged raised levels of catecholamines can be counterproductive. Xamoterol, a partial agonist that acts on the cardiac beta 1-adrenergic receptor, modifies the response of the heart to variations in sympathetic activity. At rest, it produces modest improvements in cardiac contractility, relaxation, and filling without increase in myocardial oxygen demand. The improvements are maintained during exercise although the attendant tachycardia is attenuated. The beneficial effects of xamoterol on both systolic and diastolic function suggested that it would be effective in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure, and this was demonstrated in small placebo-controlled studies where effort tolerance and symptoms were improved. A large multicenter study program comprised of four studies demonstrated that patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure randomized to xamoterol (n = 617) 200 mg b.i.d. for 3 months significantly (p less than 0.0001) improved exercise capacity by 37% as compared with the placebo group (n = 300) with an increase of 18%. The xamoterol group also showed significant improvements in symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, and life values as compared with the placebo group. In one of the multicenter studies in which 433 patients were randomized to xamoterol (n = 220), placebo (n = 109), and a positive control, digoxin 0.125 mg b.i.d. (n = 104), the percentages of improvement in exercise work were 33%, 5%, and 17%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To study the acute hemodynamic effects of xamoterol, 24 patients, 39-70 years old, with mild-to-moderate postinfarction left ventricular dysfunction entered a double-blind, between-patient comparison of a single 5-minute intravenous infusion of xamoterol (0.2 mg/kg) and placebo. The acute hemodynamic effects of xamoterol were measured at rest and during two multistaged symptom-limited supine bicycle exercise tests (Ex-T), a control Ex-T followed by an Ex-T with either xamoterol or placebo. Compared with placebo, xamoterol significantly increased left ventricular contractility (Vmax and positive [+] dP/dt) and enhanced relaxation (dP/dt- and time constant relaxation) at rest and at the 25% and 50% levels of maximum exercise. The heart rate, the frequency and time to onset of anginal symptoms, the magnitude of exercise-induced ST segment depression, the left ventricular end-diastolic and peak systolic pressures, the mean pulmonary artery pressures, the cardiac index, the left ventricular stroke-work index, and the epinephrine and norepinephrine plasma levels at rest and during exercise did not differ significantly between placebo xamoterol groups. Thus, xamoterol can be a useful addition for the treatment of left ventricular dysfunction because of long-term ischemic heart disease.\r"

The possibility of a changed sensitivity to alpha and/or beta-adrenergic stimulation was also evaluated. Ten normal subjects participated in the present double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study. After establishing a baseline in nasal peak flow and nasal mucociliary clearance, the patients were treated for 8 days with either budesonide 100 micrograms/nasal cavity morning and evening, or a matching placebo. After a wash-out period of 2 weeks the treatment was repeated using the other treatment alternative. Nasal peak flow measurements were taken immediately before and 1 h after each application of treatment. After 1 week of treatment the nasal mucociliary transport was determined and the subjects were subjected to an intranasal challenge with 0.05 mg of oxymetazoline and 5.2 mg terbutaline on 2 different days in order to test for alpha and beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity. The response to these challenges was monitored by symptom scores and nasal peak flow measurements. Neither active treatment with budesonide aqueous suspension nor the placebo treatment induced any change in the mucociliary transport time nor in nasal airway as measured with the peak flow meters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Test results were compared with the pure tone air-bone gaps. The specificity and sensitivity of each test method was estimated. The tuning-fork Bing test was less sensitive than the audiometric Bing test, but had greater specificity. However, the Rinne test with the 256 Hz fork and the loudness comparison method was more sensitive than the Bing tuning-fork test, and had similar specificity. The Rinne is therefore the better test for clinical use.\r"

The descending thoracic aorta is of particular interest in these studies and the results reflect peripheral vascular resistance, both in the fetal placental circulation and in fetal abdominal and peripheral areas. A pathologic finding in blood velocity waveforms, especially an absent end-diastolic velocity, seems to be an early and consistent alteration that precedes the occurrence of a pathologic CTG pattern by at least several days. According to our experience, the main benefit of fetal blood flow studies is in differentiation between IUGR fetuses, in which growth retardation is accompanied by some degree of fetal hypoxia, and those cases in which the small size does not signify an immediate threat to fetal well-being. Nevertheless, there are still a number of diagnostic and practical problems. The individual fetal capability to tolerate impaired fetal placental circulation and hemodynamic redistribution is variable. Hence, it is impossible to make clinical decisions based only on hemodynamic findings; we also need diagnostic support from other methods (evaluation of fetal structures by ultrasound, CTG registration, rapid fetal karyotyping, and fetal acid-base status). In some cases, pathologic blood velocity waveforms develop as soon as at weeks 24-27, and because of the lack of reliable therapeutic methods to improve fetal condition, the selection of an ideal time of delivery is often a compromise between threatened fetal asphyxia and prematurity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Given 142,000 cases of breast cancer expected to occur in 1989, this would represent 12,780 cases of HBC patients. Soberingly, each patient represents a family with a variable number of inordinately high risk patients. HBC's natural history is distinctive and enables the identification of at risk patients who can benefit from highly targeted surveillance/management strategies. High priority must be given to development of biomarkers that will one day be found to have acceptable sensitivity and specificity to genotype status. Thus, we would then be able to tell which of the first-degree relatives of affected members have inherited the deleterious gene. This would result in a significant saving of time and money that would otherwise be expended through intensive surveillance strategies. We need cost-benefit research to induce third party carriers to defray expenses for surveillance. Finally, priority attention must be given to biomolecular research for identification of markers of acceptable sensitivity and specificity to the cancer-prone genotype. Eventual cloning of the deleterious gene(s) could lead to knowledge about its chemical and physiologic products, thereby enabling anticancer pharmacologic research. The reward could then be improved control and even prevention of breast cancer, and possibly of the associated cancers in heterogenous forms of this disease.\r"

Well known are the detrimental effects of malnutrition on host defenses. New work has shown that the addition of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or the amino acid arginine to the diet may significantly enhance immune function. These dietary manipulations have been shown to inhibit tumorigenesis and cancer spread in animal models, and form the basis for exciting new work in the prevention and treatment of cancer in humans.\r"

  ".W": "An increasingly large number of dietary components have been found to alter immune system function and, therefore, may be considered to have a pharmacologic effect (pharmacologic nutrition). Those dietary factors which have already been shown to influence outcome by producing a pharmacologic effect rather than correcting or preventing a simple deficiency include proteins (both type and amount), arginine, glutamine, omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids, the metals iron and zinc, and the vitamins E, C, and A. Therapeutic outcome has already been influenced by dietary therapy (pharmacologic nutrition) in patients after burn injury or who have vascular diseases, and in experimental animals for the prevention of gut origin sepsis, the prevention and treatment of infection, prevention and development of secondary lesions in autoimmune diseases, augmentation of immunosuppression in transplantation, and in the treatment of cancer. Nutritional therapy using disease-specific formulations or supplements is an old idea now undergoing rapid evolution to increasing importance for successful therapeutic outcome.\r"
