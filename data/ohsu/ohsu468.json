  ".W": "Nearly 20% of patients with neoplastic involvement of the vertebral column develop spinal cord compression, and in 8% this is the initial manifestation of cancer. Important determinants of functional prognosis are: 1) tumor biology, 2) pretreatment neurologic status, and 3) tumor location within the spinal canal and the therapy employed. Future efforts should be invested in manipulation of the last two determinants. Delay in neurologic deterioration may be achieved by pharmacologic manipulation of the deleterious pathophysiologic processes operating in the compressed spinal cord, as recently demonstrated in experimental animal models. Use of modern neuro-imaging techniques (metrizamide myelography combined with computed tomography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging) will accurately define tumor extent and location. Radiotherapy is indicated in highly or moderately radiosensitive tumors. Surgery is reserved for the following situations: diagnosis in doubt, previous radiation exposure, radioresistant tumors, neurologic deterioration during irradiation, and the presence of spinal instability or bone compression of the neural structures. The location of the compressing tumor will dictate the surgical approach--a vertebral body resection in an anterior or anterolateral tumor and a laminectomy in a posterior or posterolateral deposit. Modern instrumentation techniques for spinal column stabilization or vertebral body replacement will allow immediate painless ambulation and a better quality of life for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Lumbar spinal stenosis, most commonly caused by hypertrophic changes in the soft tissues of the spinal canal, is itself a clinical entity, but in the early phase it can also serve as a factor influencing general back disorder morbidity. It can be identified reliably by measuring the anteroposterior diameter of the dural sac on myelography films and/or the transverse area of the dural sac on computed tomography (CT) scans. In the present study, 76 patients with general back disorders were examined with ultrasound (US) transabdominally through the intervertebral disc. In those 50 patients (66%) in which all three of the lowest lumbar intervertebral spaces could be visualized, the measurements made by US differed by +/- 5 mm from those obtained by myelography and +/- 25 mm2 from those made by CT. In a subset of ten patients with spinal stenosis, US was able to demonstrate the small size of the dural sac, but the cause of the stenosis could not be reliably evaluated. In addition to diagnosing central spinal stenosis, ultrasonography is also well suited for screening purposes.\r"

  ".W": "Using pulsed Doppler ultrasound through the sonic window of the anterior fontanelle in infants, 46 children with ventriculomegaly had sequential evaluations of Resistive Index for comparison with the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Hydrocephalus was associated with myelomeningocele in 17 patients and posthemorrhagic, postmeningitic, or congenital hydrocephalus accounted for the rest. The Resistive Index was obtained by dividing the difference between the peak systolic and end diastolic frequencies by the systolic frequency. Criteria for shunting included massive ventriculomegaly, increasing ventriculomegaly with an abnormal increase in head circumference, and clinical evidence of symptomatic hydrocephalus. Those patients requiring shunts had a Resistive Index of 84 +/- 13% prior to shunting. The Resistive Index fell to 72 +/- 11% postshunting with the difference being statistically significant at p less than 0.001. Moreover, the postshunting values compared favorably to data on 29 normal newborns, having Resistive Indices of 71 +/- 7% and to the Resistive Indices of three patients never shunted who had values of 74%, 66%, and 71%. Variations included primarily low Resistive Indices in myelomeningocele patients whose ventricles were decompressed by the leaking spinal lesions. Resistive Index used in conjunction with clinical observations may be extremely helpful not only in predicting the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt, but also in evaluating children suspected of shunt malfunctions.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of these studies was to define the pathways by which bacteria pass from bile duct to bloodstream during acute bacterial cholangitis in the rat. The respective roles of biliary obstruction and intrabiliary pressure during the reflux of biliary bacteria were defined by the infusion of bacteria via the bile duct into rats with or without prior bile duct obstruction. As determined by quantitative blood culture analysis, bacterial reflux from bile to blood was enhanced by increased intrabiliary pressure regardless of presence or absence of biliary obstruction. Light microscopic examination of rat liver 48 hours after bile duct obstruction revealed bile ductular proliferation and bile canalicular dilatation. Light microscopic autoradiographs showed aggregates of tritiated thymidine-labeled Escherichia coli outside of interlobular bile ducts in the portal tracts. Transmission electron microscopic examination of rat liver perfused with a bacterial suspension via the common bile duct showed disruption of liver cells and formation of intracellular vacuoles. Bacteria appeared to enter the sinusoidal spaces via these intracellular vacuoles. We conclude that during retrograde biliary infusion (1) increased intrabiliary pressure is the main determinant of increased bacterial reflux into blood; (2) bacteria enter the bloodstream by predominantly intracellular pathways; and (3) prior biliary obstruction is not a significant factor in bacterial reflux from bile to bloodstream.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the potential of Tc-NGA imaging in clinical liver transplantation. A total of 25 studies were performed in nine patients. Imaging studies performed in the early posttransplant period in patients with good hepatic allograft function revealed diffuse patchiness in tracer distribution, a manifestation of preservation damage. Left lobar infarction was demonstrated within a few hours of ischemic injury. Right posterior segmental infarction was seen in another patient. Comparison of kinetic, clinical, and biochemical data revealed good correlation between hepatic allograft function and Tc-NGA kinetics. Major kinetic alterations were noted during periods of preservation injury, hepatic infarction, and acute rejection. These studies indicate: (1) major alterations in Tc-NGA kinetics occur during preservation injury, hepatic infarction, and acute rejection, and (2) Tc-NGA kinetic data appear to provide an accurate reflection of hepatic allograft function. Tc-NGA imaging has the advantages of being noninvasive and of utilizing standard nuclear medicine instrumentation, including portable imaging devices. In conclusion, Tc-NGA imaging provides a promising noninvasive approach for evaluation of liver function in patients undergoing hepatic transplantation.\r"

An intraluminal duodenal filling defect on barium study that opacifies during cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is diagnostic. We present one case of choledochocele in which the first use of the biliary scintigraphic (HIDA) scan for diagnosis is demonstrated. An additional 47 cases found in the literature are reviewed and a new anatomic classification of choledochoceles is proposed as a guide for treatment.

The animals were then monitored for an additional 5 days. We noted an attenuation of the lung microvascular permeability changes with the later endotoxin doses. However, a 50% increase in cardiac index and oxygen consumption and a leukocytosis were seen beginning with the ninth endotoxin injection; these persisted throughout the 15-day postendotoxin period, as did an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. The hyperdynamic state was present when plasma prostanoids were only modestly increased, and there was no evidence of increased lung or systemic vascular permeability. Postmortem lung findings, 5 days after endotoxin administration, showed a marked interstitial inflammatory response, with infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and some lymphocytes and an increase in interstitial fibrous tissue. Six sheep were then given ibuprofen, 12.5 mg/kg, intravenously before the ninth and tenth doses and on the subsequent day. Ibuprofen significantly attenuated the hyperdynamic state and the pulmonary hypertension. In addition, the lung inflammation and fibrous tissue deposition was markedly attenuated. We conclude that a systemic hyperdynamic state develops that corresponds in time with lung inflammation but not with increased permeability. The lung and systemic changes may be blocked by ibuprofen. The ibuprofen effect may be due to a response other than prostanoid production.\r"

Anatomically effective urinary tract continuity was reestablished by means of bilateral pyelovesicostomies with concomitant rectus muscle vesicofixation to create direct stone-dumping channels into the urinary bladder. The patient is now completely without symptoms 18 months after surgery. A description and rationale for this surgical treatment is provided. Bilateral autotransplantation of the kidneys with direct drainage into the urinary bladder may be an attractive and viable therapeutic option in complicated patients with short-gut syndrome and severe refractory calcium oxalate nephroureterolithiasis.\r"

Ischemia was induced by unilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 4 hours. Gerbils were divided into four experimental groups and were studied for up to 1 week of survival: Group A (n = 50) was fed but received no insulin, Group B (n = 50) was deprived of food for 24 hours before surgery but received no insulin, Group C (n = 49) was fed and received daily injections of 0.1 IU lente insulin for 3 days before surgery, and Group D (n = 48) was deprived of food and received daily insulin injections. Insulin treatment was continued in Groups C and D after surgery. Blood glucose levels of all gerbils were determined before treatment (overall mean +/- SEM 88.0 +/- 12.4 mg/dl) and before carotid artery occlusion (Group A 92.2 +/- 18.3 mg/dl, Group B 81.4 +/- 11.7 mg/dl [p less than 0.05 different from before treatment], Group C 92.8 +/- 22.3 mg/dl, and Group D 66.1 +/- 24.0 mg/dl [p less than 0.001 different from before treatment]). Among the four groups, 52 gerbils died within 1 week. Neurologic deficits were scored and histologic evidence of the infarcts was graded in survivors at 1 week. Group C gerbils had the best stroke index scores. Histologic evaluation revealed that 35.9% of Group A, 21.1% of Group B, 13.9% of Group C (p less than 0.05 compared with Group A), and 28.1% of Group D survivors developed cerebral infarcts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When NAPSAC and standard method values were compared, correlation coefficients (r) did not exceed 0.76 for counts and 0.62 for % discs. PMS output is in the form of lights with red indicating poor quality and green or amber indicating acceptable quality. Sensitivity of the PMS instrument did not exceed 83% and specificity did not exceed 63%. Mean platelet number, % discs and pH were comparable for units triggering red versus green or amber lights. In a separate study, 13 PL732 PC stored 5 days and transfused autologously were evaluated on the PMS. Three red light units exhibited recovery and survival times similar to those observed with PC triggering green/amber lights.

We offer evidence of an early twin pregnancy with a \"vanishing twin,\" resulting in a liveborn singleton plus a fetus papyraceus. There is an increasing body of information about explanations, management, and complications associated with a multiple gestation and fetal death. The distinction between monochorionic and dichorionic twins is important in their management and for both maternal and fetal prognosis. Identification of dizygotic twins through chromosomal or sonographic studies, revealing separate placentas, separate membranes, or different sexes, theoretically allows the physician to predict a favorable outcome for the live twin and the mother.\r"

Diagnostic imaging is important in the assessment of arthropathies, particularly because it provides information about gross pathologic changes that cannot be readily determined by other methods, especially in early disease. Therefore, clinical studies correlating diagnostic imaging with laboratory and histologic findings may ultimately help to elucidate the true relationship between crystals and chronic joint disease.\r"

We analyzed the sonographic findings in 59 patients with clonorchiasis, suspected prospectively from sonographic findings and proved subsequently by demonstration of eggs in their stools. Diffuse dilatation of the small intrahepatic bile ducts with no or minimal dilatation of the large intra- and extrahepatic ducts was observed in all cases. The extrahepatic ducts were patent throughout in all except one case. This characteristic finding reflects diffuse intrahepatic bile duct obstruction and resultant proximal dilatation caused by an adult worm or aggregates of worms, as worms reside diffusely in the medium and small intrahepatic bile ducts. Cholangitis and multifocal periductal fibrosis with proximal dilatation may play an additional role. Increased echogenicity of the intrahepatic bile duct wall was present in 39 cases (66%), reflecting cholangitis and periductal fibrosis. In 17 cases (29%), floating or dependent, discrete, nonshadowing, intraluminal, echogenic foci caused by adult worms in the bile were demonstrated in the gallbladder. These echogenic foci were distinguished from stones because they were fusiform, weak in echogenicity, and floated with a change in position. Clonorchiasis should be considered when sonography discloses the characteristic pattern of bile duct dilatation with increased wall echogenicity and nonshadowing, discrete, echogenic foci in the gallbladder lumen.\r"

The sonograms of virtually every patient in the sample showed at least one of four pitfalls. The \"mirror-image\" artifact, in which the Doppler signal contained simultaneous and symmetric elements on both sides of the zero baseline, was identified in 11 patients (79%). The \"flip\" artifact, in which the Doppler signal would either flip from one side of the zero baseline to the other or would indicate a direction of blood flow opposite to that normally expected, was seen in six patients (43%). In four patients (29%), a Doppler flow signal could not be obtained from small vessels that were identified on standard real-time images. In 10 patients (71%), important vascular channels including bleeding gastroesophageal varices were obscured by bowel gas, ascites, or the patient's body habitus. Duplex sonography may still provide useful information about portal venous hemodynamics. However, it remains a prodigious technical undertaking whose accuracy can be severely hampered by artifacts and inherent technical difficulties.\r"

The purpose was to determine the incidence of septal implantation in these patients and its relation to the outcome of the pregnancies. The live-birth rate in the 12 pregnancies was 33%. Three pregnancies (25%) went to term and ended in live neonates. One (8%) resulted in a premature delivery and the neonate survived. Eight (67%) ended in abortion. Sonograms showed that in all four pregnancies that were not aborted, implantation was in the lateral wall of the uterus. In comparison, in the eight pregnancies that terminated in abortion, implantation was septal in six, mixed in one, and undetermined in one. Our experience with this small group of patients suggests that pregnancies in septate uteri have a poor prognosis and that abortion is related to septal implantation.\r"

This study compared the diagnostic accuracies of plain films, bone scans, and MR imaging studies in diabetic patients with suspicion of osteomyelitis of the foot. Twenty-nine plain radiographs, 20 bone scans, and 30 MR studies were obtained in 24 patients. Twenty-nine bones from 14 patients were pathologically proved either positive (25 bones) or negative (four bones) for osteomyelitis. Another 15 bones (10 patients) studied with MR had no pathologic proof, but the bones healed with only local wound care and/or a short course of oral antibiotics. These patients had trauma, cellulitis, or unhealed ulcers. The sensitivity and specificity of plain films were both 75%. Bone scans had a very low specificity (100% false-positive rate). A negative bone scan should strongly exclude the probability of osteomyelitis. Unlike the findings in previous reports, MR had much higher sensitivity and specificity than bone scans in detecting osteomyelitis in diabetic patients. When the 10 patients without pathologic proof (those who presumably had neuroarthropathy, vascular insufficiency, and/or cellulitis) were included, the sensitivity and specificity of all three techniques decreased. Our experience with this small group of patients suggests that MR is a useful imaging technique for diagnosing osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetic patients.\r"

  ".U": "89164077\r", 
  ".W": "A multicenter double-blind randomized study was designed to evaluate and compare the safety and diagnostic efficacy of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) (0.1 mmol/kg) against a saline placebo for use as an IV contrast agent for MR. The randomization code provided for a 2:1 ratio of Gd-DTPA and saline patients. Six investigators studied 88 patients with signs and symptoms of a cerebral lesion. Although safety data were complete in all 88 cases, only 83 had valid efficacy data (57 received Gd-DTPA, 26 placebo). Three patients were excluded from efficacy evaluation because of incomplete scans or scans with severe motion artifacts. Two patients were excluded for protocol variations (did not have a mass lesion). The protocol required that spin-echo MR images be acquired both before and after infusion at mode 1, 500/30/2 (TR/TE/excitations), and at a single-echo mode 2 sequence within a selected range, 1500-2000/56-90/2. Additional TEs could also be used at the discretion of each investigator. Efficacy was determined by comparing post- with preinjection images for relative degree of enhancement and improvement of diagnostic ability after injection, and by comparing these results with placebo results. Enhancement was reported in 43 (75%) of 57 Gd-DTPA patients and in none of the 26 placebo patients. Improvement of diagnostic ability was noted in 37 of 57 Gd-DTPA patients and in no placebo patients. Of 17 patients receiving Gd-DTPA for whom no diagnosis could be made before infusion, nine of 17 were diagnosed after infusion. By comparison, none of five patients not diagnosed before infusion of placebo could be diagnosed after infusion. Of 43 patients in whom lesion enhancement was observed after Gd-DTPA infusion, the diagnosis changed after infusion in 16 (37%) and the number of lesions detected after infusion increased in 10 (23%). Safety studies showed no clinically significant abnormal trends. Minor changes in blood pressure, pulse, and serum iron levels were noted in a higher percentage of Gd-DTPA patients. This study confirms that Gd-DTPA is an efficacious contrast agent for use with MR and that it exhibits excellent patient tolerance. Enhancement allows for a decisive diagnosis to be made in selected cases in which such capability had previously been lacking with unenhanced MR.\r"

  ".W": "Unstable angina appears to be a good clinical marker for rapidly progressing coronary artery disease. Pathologically, an unstable atherothrombotic coronary lesion, represented by a raised atherosclerotic plaque with ruptured surface causing variable degree of hemorrhage into the plaque and luminal thrombosis (rapid plaque progression), usually is present in patients at autopsy after a period of unstable angina. The thrombus at the rupture site may be mural and limited (just sealing the rupture) or occlusive, depending on the degree of preexisting atherosclerotic stenosis. An occlusive thrombus is seldom seen over ruptured plaques causing less than 75% stenosis (histologic cross-sectional area reduction), but it is found with increasing frequency when severity of stenosis increases beyond 75%. Most occlusive thrombi have a layered structure with thrombus material of differing age indicating an episodic growth by repeated mural deposits, and microemboli/microinfarcts are frequently found in the myocardium downstream to coronary thrombi, indicating intermittent thrombus fragmentation with peripheral embolization. Such a \"dynamic thrombosis\" (with or without a concomitant focal vasospastic phenomenon) at the site of an unstable (ruptured) atherosclerotic lesion obviously may lead to the other thrombus-related acute coronary events: myocardial infarction or sudden death. Accordingly, progression of unstable angina to myocardial infarction or sudden death should, in principle, be preventable by the correct timing of current available therapies aimed to prevent or eliminate (1) the chronic atherosclerotic obstruction, (2) the acute plaque disruption, (3) luminal thrombosis, and (4) vasospasm.\r"

Damage from acute ischemia is not due solely to the interruption of blood flow; rather, ischemia initiates a cascade of reactions involving partially reduced oxygen, inflammatory mediators, mechanical capillary obstruction by granulocytes and other events that lead to irreversible injury. A surprising consequence is that reperfusion by delivering oxygen and granulocytes may counteract some of the benefits of restoring flow. Mechanisms of neutrophil and free radical injury include superoxide radical formation and lipid peroxidation, progressive leukocyte capillary plugging and capillary no-reflow, and edema. The interaction of various specific mechanisms of injury in the heart (i.e., xanthine oxidase, mitochondrial superoxide leak, neutrophil superoxide, degranulation and capillary plugging, and neutrophil-derived vasoconstrictors) deserves further study.\r"

  ".W": "Angina pectoris that is mainly caused by coronary artery spasm (coronary spastic angina) has 1 or more of the following characteristics: (1) the attack occurs at rest, (2) the attack is associated with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (not necessarily so in case of old myocardial infarction), (3) the attack has a variable exercise threshold, and (4) the attack is suppressed by calcium antagonists but not by beta-adrenergic blocking agents. By this criteria, coronary artery spasm is involved in the development of most angina pectoris in patients with 1-vessel disease. The role of coronary artery spasm in the development of acute myocardial infarction is still controversial. However, in this study, injection of nitroglycerin, 0.2 mg, into the totally or subtotally occluded coronary artery either released the occlusion or improved the patency in 13 of the 69 patients (18.8%) with acute transmural myocardial infarction in whom coronary arteriography was performed within 4.0 +/- 1.9 hours of the onset of symptoms. Thus, coronary artery spasm appears to play a role in the production of acute myocardial infarction in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the accuracy of digital subtraction angiographic assessment of coronary flow reserve in critical coronary stenosis, time-density curves were obtained from digital angiograms for a myocardial region of interest. Time-to-peak contrast (TPC) and contrast washout rate (T) were measured in 11 patients with critical 1-vessel lesions before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Collectively, the values of TPC and T were significantly shortened, from 5.8 +/- 1.1 to 4.4 +/- 1.0 seconds (p less than 0.01) and from 11.3 +/- 4.0 to 5.2 +/- 1.2 seconds (p less than 0.001) after PTCA, respectively. All 11 patients except 1 showed shortened T after PTCA; however, in 5 of the 11 patients, TPC after PTCA had approximately the same values as those before PTCA. In experiments in dogs with critical circumflex stenosis, coronary flow and posterior wall thickening at rest were not different from control; however, contrast media-induced hyperemia was markedly attenuated, accompanied by a significant prolongation of T (7.7 +/- 4.5 vs 15.8 +/- 1.9 seconds, p less than 0.01) and completely unchanged TPC (both 6.8 seconds). With simultaneous tracings of coronary flow and time-density curves, TPC and the washout phase on the curve corresponded with contrast-induced transient flow reduction and hyperemic phases, respectively. It is concluded that T appears more sensitive than TPC when basal coronary flow is maintained to almost normal levels, as in patients with stable effort angina pectoris having critical coronary stenosis.\r"

  ".U": "89164154\r", 
  ".W": "In the experimental animal, acute ischemia by interruption of coronary blood supply is accompanied by a steepening of the slope of the left ventricular pressure-volume and pressure-segment length relations. This increase in chamber stiffness is associated with an increase in myocardial stiffness assessed from the slope of the diastolic stress-strain relation. Supply-type ischemia in humans brought about by balloon inflation during coronary angioplasty leads to an upward shift of the pressure-length relation of the ischemic and the adjacent segment combined with a steepening of the slope. In demand ischemia produced by rapid pacing in patients with coronary artery disease, an increased radial stiffness modulus at any level of radial stress was present when compared with that during the resting state. These alterations of the stress-strain relation suggest that the physical properties of the myocardium change during both supply and demand ischemia. The increased diastolic myocardial stiffness appears to result, at least in part, from increased residual interaction between actin and myosin filaments.\r"

There is decreased chamber compliance as well during coronary occlusion, while the zero volume intercept of the ventricle in diastole is larger, changes that may relate in part to regional ultrastructural alterations at the sarcomere level. Postpacing studies suggest that decreased chamber compliance also occurs in that setting, but with an opposite shift upward of the diastolic pressure-volume relation, which may relate to reperfusion effects. The factors involved in such changes in stiffness undoubtedly are multiple, and also include delayed ventricular relaxation, which can be magnified at rapid heart rates, effects of nonuniformity, and possibly the timing of loading conditions during individual contractions. The relative influence of these multiple factors undoubtedly varies with the conditions and duration of acute ischemia.\r"

The hope is that these 3 achievements will result in reduced short- and long-term mortality rates. The techniques used in this overall strategy are still under investigation. Three leading pharmacologic compounds vie for supremacy: streptokinase as well as its anisoylated form, recombinant technique tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase with or without prourokinase. In addition, the underlying anatomy may require early, or delayed, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty where needed backed by coronary artery bypass grafting. Thus, the tactics of the intervention may vary from case to case and indeed from center to center depending on experience and facilities, but the conclusion is clearly the same: Early reperfusion is a must if one wishes to save ischemic but viable tissue. This report summarizes the current evidence for this new strategy.\r"

Both simvastatin doses were significantly more effective than probucol in improving the plasma lipid profile. Mean reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 34% with 20-mg simvastatin and 40% with the 40-mg dosage, compared to a mean reduction of 8% with probucol. Simvastatin significantly decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipo-protein B, and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Probucol caused some reduction in LDL cholesterol but significantly decreased HDL cholesterol. Both simvastatin and probucol were well tolerated and no serious drug-related events occurred.

Diastolic BP was controlled at less than 90 mm Hg with 1 of 4 regimens: low dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 25 mg twice daily; high dose HCTZ, 50 mg twice daily; or high dose HCTZ plus a low or high dose of a step II drug (propranolol, clonidine or reserpine). After 6 months of treatment that controlled BP, dosages were reduced in two-thirds of the patients. In those patients receiving low dose HCTZ and randomized to dose reduction, antihypertensive drugs were completely discontinued. Although approximately half of these patients remained normotensive for the first 6 months, a significantly greater proportion had elevation of BP compared to the control group, which continued to receive treatment (p less than 0.0001). In the high dose HCTZ drug group, the proportion of patients remaining normotensive did not differ among those stepped down to low dose HCTZ and the fully treated control group. While not achieving significance the trend was similar with the step II regimens. Although some patients remained normotensive after discontinuation of step II drugs, a greater proportion returned to elevated BP than when step II dosage was unchanged. Therefore, while stopping therapy may be effective in some patients, a decreased dosage is significantly more effective as a method for maintaining an antihypertensive effect. Decreasing drug dosages offers the dual benefit of minimizing side effects and reducing drug costs.\r"

The mechanisms underlying these flow alterations were studied in 25 patients and correlated with hemodynamics. The patients with abnormal flow patterns had increased right atrial V-wave pressures. This was associated with an increased right ventricular early diastolic pressure. The incidence of clinical heart failure was higher in patients with SF less than DF or DF alone (8 of 11) compared with 5 of 10 patients with SF = DF. Thus, in patients with pulmonary hypertension, the abnormal jugular venous flow patterns appear to be caused by both an increased DF velocity and a decrease in SF velocity. Because the right atrial V-wave pressures were similar in patients with both SF = DF and SF less than DF or DF alone and the incidence of heart failure was higher in the latter, the decrease in SF must be a later phenomenon. Serial observations confirmed this temporal sequence. The applicability of these observations to bedside evaluation of patients with pulmonary hypertension is emphasized.\r"

Before operation, all patients had normal right-sided cardiac hemodynamics, normal jugular pulse contours and normal jugular venous flow velocity patterns, i.e., systolic flow (SF) velocity greater than diastolic flow (DF) velocity. After operation, jugular venous flow velocity was abnormal in 24 patients (SF = DF in 14 and SF less than DF in 10). Neither the right-sided cardiac pressures after the operation nor any of the perioperative factors examined had any bearing on these flow alterations. Postoperative right ventricular ejection fraction was normal in all 5 patients with SF greater than DF and SF = DF flow patterns (mean +/- standard error of the mean 48 +/- 3%). It was significantly depressed in all 6 patients with SF less than DF flow pattern (34 +/- 1%, 2p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that the right atrium behaves as a conduit rather than a capacitance chamber. However, the postoperative abnormal flow pattern of SF less than DF as opposed to SF = DF indicates the additional presence of right ventricular dysfunction. The implications of these observations for the clinical assessment of right ventricular function in the postoperative patients are discussed.\r"

However, epidemiologic evidence in support of these findings has been elusive. Cross-sectional surveys show that populations with a higher prevalence of caries in their deciduous teeth also show a lower prevalence of caries in their permanent teeth. However, longitudinal data from individuals show exactly the opposite. Caries development is also delayed as a consequence of a delayed tooth eruption and thus the bell-shaped curve that results from plotting deciduous caries prevalence vs age is shifted to the right in malnourished children. This effect will result in an apparently negative association between caries in deciduous and permanent teeth when cross-sectional surveys are compared. Once the effect on tooth eruption is taken into account, the contribution of malnutrition to increased caries susceptibility may be observed, as demonstrated by a recent cross-sectional study involving Peruvian children.\r"

CD34-positive leukemia was more likely to arise after chemotherapy. Patients with CD34-positive leukemia were less likely to enter a complete remission even when analysis was limited to those patients receiving a high-dose induction-type chemotherapy regimen. Giemsa-banding karyotyping studies were obtained in 55 of the cases. In 30 of these cases (56%) clonal karyotypic abnormalities were demonstrated. Although the karyotypic abnormalities and phenotypes were varied, there was a high degree of association between the karyotypic abnormalities monosomy 7/del (7q) and the CD34-positive phenotype; this antigen was expressed on blasts from eight of the nine patients displaying this abnormality.

In von Willebrand's disease, a characteristic defect of PH with significant inhibition or absence of collagen-platelet interaction was observed in all the 11 patients. PH was greatly prolonged in both of the two patients with storage pool deficiency. The technique detected improvement of platelet function, i.e., PH in all of six patients with bleeding disorders after replacement therapy or DDAVP infusion. The authors conclude that the Haemostatometer technique is a sensitive test for determining platelet dysfunction and monitoring efficacy of factor-replacement or DDAVP therapy.\r"

D-dimer confirms that both thrombin generation and plasmin generation have occurred. Patients at risk for DIC (58) and normal controls (7) were studied. Thirty-three patients had DIC--with fragment D-dimer identified in their serum by immunoblotting. Latex agglutination measurements of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimer were compared with immunoblotting in the detection of D-dimer. FDP measurement was extremely sensitive but not specific. D-dimer measurement was less sensitive but highly specific. Used in tandem, screening with FDP and confirming with D-dimer, sensitivity and specificity were maximized, rendering a predictive value of a confirmed FDP of 100% in this cohort. D-dimer is a valuable adjunct for the laboratory diagnosis of DIC but is most appropriately used as a confirmatory test for the very sensitive FDP test.\r"

Eighty amniotic fluid specimens were analyzed. FLM results were reported as high (H), intermediate (I), or low positive (L). TLC was compared with FLM:H (n = 27), mean 0.14 (fraction of total phospholipids); I (n = 7), mean 0.11; L (n = 9), mean 0.03; negative results had no detectable PG by TLC. In 33 cases E-PG was compared with FLM:H (n = 9), mean 7.0 mumol/L; I (n = 5), mean 8.1 mumol/L; L (n = 3), mean 3.0 mumol/L; negative (n = 16), mean 3.2 mumol/L. Records were reviewed in 70 cases. Thirty cases were excluded: sample to delivery time was greater than 72 hours; steroids were given or sepsis was documented. Fetal lung immaturity was clinically present in six cases: respiratory distress syndrome in three cases and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in three cases. One false positive result was identified (TTN, FLM:H). FLM sensitivity for fetal lung maturity was 85.3%, specificity was 83.3%, and the positive predictive value for fetal lung maturity was 96.7%. FLM is a fast, reliable indicator of fetal lung maturity.\r"

Although the tritiated thymidine labeling index (TLI) is the standard method of S-phase measurement, it is difficult to perform. The authors describe a slide-based immunofluorescence labeling index (LI) method that uses 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) as the pulsing medium and a monoclonal antibody (BU-1) to BrdUrd. The BrdUrd LI was performed on 217 NHLs and compared with routine histologic results. The authors found a median BrdUrd LI of 0.9% for low-grade NHLs; 7.5% for intermediate-grade; 10.4% for high-grade; and 2.2% for T-cell NHLs. This method provides a rapid, reliable S-phase measurement that can be easily performed in the clinical laboratory. It should replace the TLI and allow wider application of S-phase measurements in the NHL.\r"

The \"true\" hemoglobin was determined on the venipuncture sample by cyanmethemoglobin assay. Eligibility (pass/fail) was established for each site/result with the use of standard and investigational cut-offs. Results were used to predict the performance of two-method protocols beginning with copper sulfate followed by FS or EL using Statcrit or HemoCue. Individually, the method sensitivities for hemoglobin below cut-off were low (12.5-62.5%) with the use of standard cut-offs. Assuming 5% prevalence of low hemoglobin, two-method protocols would inappropriately pass more than half of those with low hemoglobin, whereas the proportion of deferred donors with adequate \"true\" hemoglobin ranged widely (2.8-72.3%). For some methods, investigational cut-offs achieved improved sensitivity with no effect on specificity. Despite standard hemoglobin \"requirements\" for blood donation, the ability of the investigated methods to correctly classify donors is poor and varies considerably with method and protocol. With cut-offs as specified, the standards for FS and EL samples are not equivalent; the EL cut-offs are too low and the method is inherently less sensitive. Standardization may be better achieved by specifying both required hemoglobin and minimum performance for screening methods.\r"

For the direct inoculation and lysis-centrifugation methods, the recovery rates were 96.9% and 98.5%, respectively, and the mean times to detection were essentially the same (23.6 and 23.8 days, respectively). Thus, the direct-inoculation technique using 13A medium showed performance equivalent to the lysis-centrifugation method. Also, the direct method has the advantage of elimination of the time-consuming manual manipulations that are required by lysis-centrifugation methods.\r"

Compared with conventional testing, overall, 327 of 394 (83%) clinically irrelevant organisms resulted in a report of no Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., or Yersinia enterocolitica with EPS. Four hundred forty-nine of 457 (98%) of clinically irrelevant organisms yielded negative LPA results. Because the LPA method is faster, eliminates more clinically irrelevant organisms from further testing, and does not require the use of an expensive identification system, the authors believe that it is better suited for direct screening for Salmonella and Shigella for most clinical laboratories.\r"

The pancreatic specimen revealed only discrete islet cell abnormalities, namely B-cells budding off ductular epithelium, islets in apposition to ducts, slight islet cell hypertrophy, and islet enlargement. Immunohistochemistry showed normal total endocrine cell content as well as normal proportions of islet cell subpopulations. Review of 20 cases in the literature and the authors' experience led to subtotal (75-90%) pancreatectomy as the treatment of choice. The authors conclude that the pediatric disease of nesidioblastosis may rarely occur in adults and that the paucity of histologic findings makes the exclusion of an insulinoma mandatory.\r"

In tumor cells, increased amounts of F-actin without change in its total amount have been observed, suggesting a modification in the organisation of this protein. The authors have localized gelsolin, total actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and prekeratin in frozen sections of normal human breast and infiltrating duct carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. A positive staining for gelsolin was observed in normal epithelial and myoepithelial cells but not in stromal fibroblasts. In contrast, no staining for gelsolin was detectable in carcinomatous cells, with the exception of remaining myoepithelial cells; myofibroblasts of the stromal reaction displayed an intense positive reaction. The absence of gelsolin staining in the epithelial cells of breast carcinoma may reflect their dedifferentiation or proliferative and invasive activities. The appearance of gelsolin in stromal cells raises the question as to what is its function in this situation. The immunohistochemical detection of gelsolin may be a useful adjunct to the study of mammary gland epithelium malignant transformation.\r"

Sections of aorta were prepared from young White Carneau pigeons fed an atherogenic diet to induce lesions rich in lipid-laden macrophages and from older pigeons that had naturally-occurring atherosclerotic lesions. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) 3-B-3, 9-A-2, or 2-B-6 and 5-D-4, recognizing delta Di-6S generated from chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S) PG; delta Di-4S generated from dermatan sulfate (DS) PG and from chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S); and sulfated poly N-acetyllactosamine sequences common to keratan sulfate (KS), respectively, were used to localize PG types by indirect immunofluorescence. In normal aorta, C6S PG was localized primarily in the media and showed a fluorescent gradient (inner media greater than outer media greater than intima greater than adventitia). In the atherosclerotic plaque, major immunoreactivity was observed using MAb 9-A-2 or 2-B-6, whereas lesser amounts were observed with 3-B-3. Patterns of immunoreactivity differed; 9-A-2 or 2-B-6 appeared to be associated with cells whereas 3-B-3 appeared to be intercellular. Although normal aorta was negative for antibody 5-D-4, recognizing KS, atherosclerotic plaques were consistently positive for this antibody. The pattern of 5-D-4 reactivity appeared to be intercellular. Except for immediately below the lesion, no reactive product using 5-D-4 was observed in the media. No major differences in distribution of PG were observed between naturally-occurring or cholesterol-induced fibrous plaques. These results indicate that both 4-sulfated PG and a previously undescribed KS glycoconjugate are major components of the atherosclerotic lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Abundant extracellular lipid deposits are associated with cell necrosis and tissue weakening in the core region of human atherosclerotic fibrous plaques. The ultrastructural morphology of the core region, previously undefined because of lipid extraction artifacts, was studied with the aid of new osmium-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium and osmium-tannic acid-paraphenylenediamine sequences for tissue processing. Small droplets of neutral lipid (30 to 400 nm profile diameter) and lipid vesicles with aqueous centers accounted for more than 90% of the area occupied by lipid-rich structures in the core region. No foam cells were present. Cholesterol crystals, lipid droplets of a size similar to those in foam cells (0.4 to 6 mu), and larger neutral lipid deposits (greater than 6 mu) together occupied less than 10% of the total area of lipid structures. Abundant lipid vesicles were associated with the nearby presence of cholesterol crystals, whereas small lipid droplets were predominant in areas without crystals. Many droplets had surface defects in the form of pits and vesicular blebs. These morphologic findings are explained most concisely by postulating direct accumulation of extracellular lipid from interstitial lipoproteins as a major process in core region formation. Moreover, a dynamic state of ongoing physical/metabolic transformation of extracellular lipid deposits is suggested.\r"

  ".W": "The role of brain catalase in the mediation of ethanol's effects on motor activity was investigated. Male Long-Evans rats were pretreated with i.p. injections of the catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (AT) (1 g/kg) or saline (S). Four hours later, animals in each group received i.p. injections of one of two doses of ethanol (ETOH) [1.0 g/kg (E1) or 2.0 g/kg (E2)] or one of two volumes of distilled water (W1 or W2). Ten minutes after the administration of these agents, animals were placed in open-field chambers and motor activity was recorded during a 10-min testing period. Results indicated that the motor depression produced by 2.0 g/kg of ETOH was significantly attenuated in AT pretreated rats (group AT-E2). AT pretreatment, however, had no effect on motor activity for subjects injected with 1.0 g/kg ethanol or water. Total brain catalase activity in AT-pretreated animals was 15% of control animals. No differences in blood ethanol levels were observed between AT- and S-pretreated animals. An interaction between ethanol and AT at the level of the central nervous system is suggested. The results of the present study suggest that brain catalase activity may be involved in ethanol's effects. They also provide further support for the notion that acetaldehyde may be produced directly in the brain via catalase and that it may be a factor mediating some of ethanol's central effects.\r"

In both positive and negative studies the amount of alcohol consumed by women with breast cancer was low, and if there is an association between alcohol and breast cancer, then it would appear that complete abstinence would be required to reduce the risk of this disease. At present, it seems premature to consider such a drastic recommendation until further information becomes available.\r"

  ".W": "Prior studies in rodents, sheep, and subhuman primates have shown that ethanol, especially after chronic exposure, inhibits the transport of amino acids by the placenta. A small decrease in glucose transport by rat placenta chronically exposed to ethanol has also been noted. With human placental slices, however, only pharmacological (high) concentrations of ethanol impaired uptake of amino acids, and there are no data on glucose transport. In the present study, the effect of brief exposure to ethanol on human placental transport of model amino acids and glucose was studied by two techniques not previously jointly employed for this--the perfused human placental cotyledon and human placental vesicle systems. The nonmetabolizable amino acids, alpha-aminoisobutyric (AIB) acid and cycloleucine (CLEU), as well as D-glucose, and nonmetabolized glucose (3-O-methyl-D-glucose), were used as probes. AIB and CLEU are transferred normally by active transport and D-glucose by facilitated transport from maternal to fetal compartments. The perfused placental system was exposed to ethanol (300-500 mg%) for 2-4 hr and the vesicles to 200-400 mg% ethanol for times varying from 10 min to 48 hr. There was no impairment of AIB, D-glucose, or 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transfer by ethanol using these techniques. Normally, about 60% of AIB transport by human placenta is sodium dependent. This component (using the vesicle system) was also not impaired by ethanol. Ethanol caused a very small decrease of CLEU clearance by the perfused human placenta (p = 0.05) but not using vesicles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The use of inbred strains has indicated that virtually all responses to EtOH have a significant degree of genetic determination. Studies with large batteries of inbred strains have elucidated the common genetic control of several clusters of EtOH-related variables. Studies with Recombinant Inbred strains have identified single genes that may influence EtOH withdrawal severity and EtOH preference drinking. The best developed method has been the use of selective breeding to develop lines of mice or rats differing in EtOH-related behavioral characters. Illustrative examples of potentially important research findings from experiments with LS/SS, P/NP, and WSP/WSR selected lines are discussed. Significant progress has been made in the use of genetic animal models to further our understanding of EtOH-related traits. Several avenues for further research appear to be promising, and specific directions to be pursued are suggested.\r"

Chronic ethanol administration resulted in a loss of the mammary cell polarization, in a reduction of the Golgi dictyosomal elements and in several abnormalities at the level of casein maturation and secretion, whereas lipid synthesis and secretion did not seem to be affected. Normal spherical casein micelles took on a filament-like structure and casein vesicles appeared fused together forming macrovesicles. All these alterations were specific of ethanol and/or acetaldehyde action and were not due to the associated malnutrition, as deduced from the lack of visible effects in the nutritional control group.\r"

A subsample of 52 patients met the following criteria: age less than 46 years, no history of severe head injury or focal signs of traumatic brain damage, and no history of liver disease, drug abuse, or long-lasting anticonvulsant therapy. However, 72% of the patients showed brain atrophy and 49% intellectual impairment as compared to 16% and 13%, respectively, in an age-matched sample of men from the general population. Five years later, after excluding patients with head trauma, serious alcoholic liver disease and drug abuse, 37 patients were reinvestigated. Sixteen patients were abstinent or had greatly improved drinking habits during the 5-year follow-up period and 21 were still drinking. Alcohol abstinence was found to be associated with a regress of cortical atrophy and central atrophy as assessed by the width of the 3rd ventricle. However, the recovery was not complete as compared with the prevalence of atrophy in the sample from the general population. Among the patients a significant improvement in one cognitive test and a trend to improvement in some other tests associated with improved drinking habits was observed. Regression of central atrophy as assessed by a decreased diameter of the 3rd ventricle was associated with improvement in the very same cognitive tests. The results suggest that both atrophy of the brain and cognitive ability can improve in alcoholics who give up drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All experimental animals were pair-fed the same diet as controls except that glucose was isocalorically replaced by ethanol. Rats fed tallow and ethanol developed none of the features of ALD, those fed lard and ethanol developed minimal to moderate disease, rats fed corn oil and ethanol developed the most severe pathology. The degree of histopathological abnormality correlated with the linoleic acid content of fat in the diet (tallow 0.7%, lard 2.5%, corn oil 56.6%). We postulate that linoleic acid facilitates development of ALD and provides an explanation for our previous epidemiological observations.\r"

These parameters were also measured during the hangover, both under resting condition and during an anaerobic ergometer exercise. Acute intake of ethanol (1.5 g/kg body weight) had no statistically significant effect either on plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations or beta-adrenergic receptor levels. Ethanol consumption did neither change the urinary excretion of catecholamine metabolites (homovanillic acid, normetanephrine, metanephrine, and 3-methoxyhydroxymandelic acid). Exercise was associated with a 6-10-fold elevation in plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations and with a two- to threefold elevation on beta-adrenergic receptor levels. This effect of exercise was not modified by preceding alcohol intake and resulting hangover. These preliminary findings suggest that acute alcohol intake does not significantly alter the concentration and functioning of human beta-adrenergic receptors.\r"

In a conventional medium with 5 mM glucose the activity after one week of culture was only 30% of that initially measured in culture. Addition of 25 mM glucose or a high concentration of amino acids delayed the decrease. When these compounds were added together it was possible to maintain the initial activity for one week, but the activity declined during the following week. Addition of growth hormone had no effect during the first week of culture but abolished the fall during the second week.

  ".W": "Male and female rat pups were administered ethanol (3 g/kg/dose) twice daily by intragastric intubation between postnatal Day (PN) 4 and 8. Pups were maternally reared throughout the exposure period and until sacrifice on PN20. The consequences of this growth spurt exposure to ethanol were measured by an impact upon body growth, as well as upon specific growth parameters and cholinergic neurochemical factors within the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum. Specific endpoints included muscarinic receptor binding dynamics, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activities, regional wet weights, and subcellular protein content. In male pups, ethanol resulted in a significant enhancement of body weight gain and an increase in striatal but not cortical mass. Additionally, ethanol exposure resulted in a significant increase in striatal muscarinic receptor affinity, regardless of gender. This was accompanied by evidence of a significantly greater density of striatal muscarinic receptors in males versus females, regardless of treatment. Overall, the ethanol-associated effects are suggestive of a drug-induced developmental delay. Gender-specific, treatment-independent differences were also detected in the developing brain regions. Thus, regardless of treatment, cerebral cortical S1-level protein content was found to be significantly greater in males than in females. Furthermore, there were gender-based, significant differences in AChE activity within the striatum of control pups (males greater than females). Ethanol exposure resulted in a loss of this gender-based difference. We conclude that the cholinergic neurochemical development occurring in the striatum of the female rat brain between PN4 and 8 is exquisitely sensitive to ethanol-induced developmental delays which are not remediable by 12 subsequent days of maternal rearing in the absence of ethanol exposure.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reduction in IGF-1 was associated with alterations in growth hormone secretory dynamics. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol or an identical volume of diet made isocaloric with maltose-dextrin (pair-fed controls). After 4 months of continuous feeding, another group of animals of the same age was introduced into the colony and fed the maltose-dextrin diet ad libitum. All animals were atrial cannulated 4.5 months after the initiation of the experiment and serial samples of blood removed at 20-min intervals for periods up to 6 hr. Plasma was separated and growth hormone and IGF-1 concentrations determined by radioimmunoassay. Growth hormone secretory dynamics were analyzed by Cluster Analysis. Our results demonstrated that (a) chronic ethanol administration decreases plasma IGF-1 concentrations compared to either ad libitum or pair-fed control animals, (b) a reduction in dietary intake of approximately 33% reduces both the number of detectable growth hormone pulses and nadir concentrations of this hormone but has no effect on peak height, peak width, or area under the peak, and (c) ethanol feeding increases the amplitude of growth hormone pulses compared to pair-fed rats. We conclude that the decrease in plasma IGF-1 levels in ethanol as compared to pair-fed control animals is not caused by a further reduction in growth hormone secretory dynamics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current study used normal women subjects given alcohol, placebo, or a soft drink control. Placebo significantly (p less than 0.05) increased heart rate compared to the control condition, and this placebo response was in the same direction as the effect of alcohol. The correlation of heart rate change with reported intoxication was +0.44 in women, when it was negative in men (Newlin DB: Alcohol Clin Exp Res 9:411-416, 1985).

A measure of VI was used to predict alcohol related behavior 5 years later. Results indicated that lower VI was associated with lower risk for drinking per se. Lower VI was also associated with higher risk for alcohol-related problems among those who drink. These findings were robust across gender, age, and to a large extent across different areas of alcohol related problems. Cognitive-behavioral functions associated with intelligence, such as social judgement, social inference, and social skills, are proposed as possible moderators of the relationship between intelligence and alcohol-related problems.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic protein catabolism was measured in rats which were pair-fed a liquid diet containing either ethanol or isocaloric maltose-dextrin (control diet). Within 12 days after initiation of pair feeding, the level of total hepatic protein in ethanol-fed rats was 26% higher than that in pair-fed control rats. During this time interval, the catabolic rates of both short-lived [3H]puromycin-labeled proteins and long-lived native [14C]bicarbonate-labeled proteins were measured in the two groups of animals. The degradation rate of short-lived [3H]puromycinyl proteins and peptides was the same in ethanol-fed and pair-fed control rats. However, the overall catabolic rate of long-lived proteins in rats fed the ethanol liquid diet for 2-10 days was 37-40% lower than that in pair-fed controls. This difference in protein turnover was not a general phenomenon, since the time-dependent decay of [14C]proteins in the hepatic microsome fraction of ethanol-fed rats was 33% slower than that in pair-fed controls, but the apparent rate of cytosolic protein catabolism was the same in both groups of animals. The differences in protein turnover did not reflect quantitative changes in lysosomal proteases since the activities of four hepatic lysosomal cathepsins were unaffected by alcohol administration. When rats were subjected to longer periods of pair feeding (16-25 days), the difference in overall hepatic protein catabolism between ethanol-fed rats and their pair-fed controls was considerably attenuated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In liver mitochondria the rate of ATP synthesis was lowered significantly after ethanol administration for 1 month and longer feeding periods. In liver microsomes from ethanol-fed animals, ethanol oxidation and aniline hydroxylation increased 1.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively, after 1 month and remained elevated at the longer feeding intervals. Electron microscopic analyses of heart left ventricles revealed no alterations from ethanol consumption for 1 month. Alterations including disrupted mitochondrial cristae, dilatation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and widening of the intercalated discs were observed after 6.5-month feeding periods. Myocardial concentrations of creatine, creatine phosphate, ATP, ADP, and Pi remained constant even after ethanol consumption for 9 months. After a 12-month feeding period slight changes in cardiac mitochondrial energy-linked properties were observed which were not as pronounced as those occurring in liver mitochondria. The activity and oligomycin sensitivity of the ATPase were not altered in cardiac mitochondria, whereas in liver preparations significant alterations in these properties of the ATPase were apparent after ethanol consumption for 1 month and the longer feeding periods. These observations suggest that the liver responds more quickly and dramatically to chronic ethanol consumption than does the heart.\r"

Ethanol was administered to pregnant females in liquid diets (36% ethanol-derived calories) which were marginal or optimal in terms of requirements for pregnancy. Both pair-fed and ad libitum fed control groups were included. Females consuming ethanol from gestation Day 1 through parturition gained less weight, were delayed in parturition, and had fewer and smaller live born young than pair-fed or control females, regardless of whether they consumed marginal or optimal diets. Withdrawing ethanol on Day 21 of gestation attenuated many of ethanol's adverse effects on reproductive outcome. However, prenatal maternal ethanol intake altered adrenocortical activity/responsiveness of the mother, the fetus, and the preweaning offspring, regardless of maternal nutritional status. Relative adrenal weights and basal corticosterone levels were increased in the dam both prenatally and at parturition. Ethanol-exposed fetuses (A) had increased relative adrenal weights but lower basal corticosterone levels than pair-fed (PF) and control (C) fetuses on gestation Day 21. At birth, plasma and adrenal corticosterone levels were increased, while absolute adrenal weights and corticosterone binding globulin (CBG) binding capacity were decreased in A neonates. At 5 days of age, A pups showed reduced plasma corticoid responses to ether at 15 min poststress and to novelty or saline injection at 90-min post stress compared to PF and C pups. CBG binding capacity was also reduced in A pups. At 10 days of age, plasma corticosterone levels were lower overall in A and PF than in C pups following exposure to a number of different acute stressors while at 18 days plasma corticoids were decreased and adrenal corticosterone was increased in A compared to PF and/or C pups. These data support and extend previous studies indicating that in utero ethanol exposure alters postnatal adrenocortical development. This effect is specific to ethanol and unaltered by maternal nutritional status.\r"

  ".W": "This study investigated the effects of ethanol withdrawal on sensory responses of single neurons recorded in the somatosensory (SI) cortex of awake, behaving, ethanol-dependent rats. Eleven rats were fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet for 90-120 days, while 11 weight-matched controls were pair-fed an equivalent sucrose containing diet to equalize caloric intake. Single SI cortical neurons in the chronically treated rats were recorded continuously over several hours after withdrawal from ethanol, and after reintoxication induced by intraperitoneal injection of 10% (v/v) ethanol solution. Intoxication and withdrawal related changes in sensory responsiveness of these neurons were quantitatively measured by stimulating through electrodes chronically implanted under the skin of the forepaw. Sensory response histograms constructed from these stimuli showed a characteristic pattern, typically consisting of two early excitatory peaks (E1a and E1b), followed by an inhibition (I1), and in some neurons, a late excitatory response (E2). As withdrawal advanced, the sensory response histograms exhibited marked increases in the magnitudes of the E1a, I1, and E2 responses, coupled with a reduced spontaneous discharge rate. These changes are similar to, but quantitatively greater than, those which have previously been observed in normal and control rats during \"immobile arousal\" behaviors, which can be evoked when an experimenter holds the animals still, producing an immobile \"aversive arousal.\" In withdrawing animals this same \"holding\" manipulation tended to markedly exacerbate and accelerate behavioral and neurophysiological signs of withdrawal. By contrast, the same manipulations had little effect when carried out during light intoxication or early stages of withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The ability of acetaldehyde to generate free radicals is often ascribed to its oxidation by xanthine oxidase, with the subsequent production of reactive oxygen intermediates. Chemiluminescence associated with the oxidation of acetaldehyde by xanthine oxidase was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or several hydroxyl radical scavenging agents, and was stimulated by the addition of EDTA or ferric-EDTA. This suggests that the light emission is primarily due to the production of hydroxyl radicals via an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss type of reaction. Chemiluminescence with hypoxanthine as substrate for xanthine oxidase was much lower than that found with acetaldehyde, yet rates of hydroxyl radical production were greater with hypoxanthine. Acetaldehyde increased light emission in the presence of hypoxanthine by a greater than additive effect. These results suggest a complex role for acetaldehyde in catalyzing xanthine oxidase-dependent chemiluminescence. It appears that besides being a substrate for xanthine oxidase, acetaldehyde also reacts with the generated hydroxyl radical to produce acetaldehyde radicals, which yield chemiluminescence upon their decay. Further studies will be required to evaluate whether the production of such species contributes to or plays a role in the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and toxicity associated with acetaldehyde metabolism.\r"

Likewise, at doses of 1 to 2 g/kg ethanol, i.p., these lines of mice differ markedly in locomotor activity. Neurotensin (NT), intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.), induced a similar hypothermia in both SS and LS mice at doses greater than 0.02 microgram. Doses of ethanol (1.0 g/kg) or NT (0.005 microgram, i.c.v.) that failed to cause hypothermia when administered separately produced a pronounced hypothermia when administered together. Potentiation of NT and ethanol-induced hypothermia was greater in SS than in LS mice. Sensitivity to NT-induced hypothermia was greater following i.c.v. administration than by infusion into the nucleus accumbens (NA) or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurotensin, i.c.v. or intra-NA, markedly inhibited ethanol-induced increase in locomotor activity in both SS and LS mice; however, NT, intra-VTA, did not alter the effects of ethanol on locomotor activity. The results suggest that NT and ethanol act in a synergistic manner on specific neuronal processes mediating thermoregulation and spontaneous motor activity.\r"

The association between plasma levels of GGT and neuropsychological performance was independent of the relative contribution of other laboratory measures of liver injury and of alcohol consumption histories.

In the absence of surgical stimulation during steady state anesthetic conditions with controlled ventilation, average maximum change in tachograph-counted heart rate was 7% or less after 10-15-s injection of mivacurium at all doses from 0.03 to 0.30 mg/kg. Average peak change in mean arterial pressure measured via radial arterial catheter was 7% or less after all doses from 0.03 to 0.15 mg/kg. Transient (0.2-4.5 min) decreases in arterial blood pressure were noted after 10-15-s injection in some patients at 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 mg/kg. When they occurred, these changes were usually accompanied by facial erythema lasting 2-5 min and were correlated with increases in plasma histamine level (P less than 0.001). Facial erythema, decrease in blood pressure, and elevation of histamine level were all accentuated by increasing the dose of mivacurium and by more rapid injection of the drug. For example, mean blood pressure decreased an average of 13% after injection of mivacurium 0.25 mg/kg over 10-15 s. In contrast, during administration over 30 and 60 s of this dose, arterial pressure decreased 7.6 and 1.5%, respectively (P less than 0.001, 10-15 s vs. 60-s injection). Average peak histamine level, which increased to 132% of control after administration of 0.25 mg/kg over 10-15 s, did not change after injection over 60 s.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A decrease in the [3H]dihydromorphine binding affinity without influence on the density of binding sites was also observed in the presence of 100% oxygen (KdO2 = 1.40 nM). kappa receptor binding was defined using [3H](-)ethylketocyclazocine as the ligand, in the presence of 100 nM D-ala2-D-leu5-enkephalin and 30 nM morphine. While 100% nitrous oxide caused a slight decrease in [3H](-)ethylketocyclazocine binding affinity (Kdair = 0.24 nM, KdN2O = 0.31 nM) and a substantial decrease in the density of binding sites (Bmaxair = 115 fmol/mg protein, BmaxN2O = 84 fmol/mg protein), halothane dramatically affected both the affinity (Kdhalothane = 0.70 nM) and density (Bmaxhalothane = 38 fmol/mg protein). Oxygen (100%) reduced [3H]dihydromorphine binding affinity. Differential effects of two anesthetics on the same receptor or distinct actions of the same anesthetic on different receptors could indicate the presence of specific targets for anesthetics at the membrane level.

Particularly, chronic bronchitis and asthma are two common conditions in which there may be a chicken-and-egg association between the pulmonary problems and the gastroesophageal reflux. This interesting relationship needs to be considered in any patient with chronic pulmonary disease in whom the condition is progressing in spite of adequate medical therapy, in whom the history strongly supports this concept, and in whom laboratory tests suggest a causal relationship. Recognition and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, either medical or surgical, can lead to improvement in the pulmonary condition of a large number of patients.\r"

During the intermittent inhalation test, methacholine aerosols with stepwise incremental concentrations were inhaled during tidal breathing for two minutes with a following 5-minute pause interval. Specific airway conductance (SGaw) and respiratory resistance (Rrs) were measured one-half, one and one-half, and five minutes after the end of each inhalation period. Specific airway conductance and Rrs were measured with the panting and forced oscillation methods, respectively. During the continuous inhalation test, the same stepwise incremental concentrations of methacholine aerosol were inhaled during tidal breathing for two minutes without a pause while Rrs was continuously measured. The cumulative dose of methacholine required to reduce SGaw by 35% of the baseline value (PD35 SGaw) during the intermittent inhalation test was significantly correlated with the cumulative methacholine dose required to reduce Grs (= 1/Rrs) by 35% of the baseline value during the continuous inhalation test (PD35 Grs) (r = .98). There was also a significant correlation between the slopes of the intermittent inhalation test and continuous inhalation test curves (r = .80). The results indicate that methacholine provocation can be measured as reliably using a simple continuous inhalation method as by a more complex intermittent one.\r"

Following reproducible bronchoprovocation with these stimuli, each subject underwent randomized, double-blind, crossover pretreatment with single doses of nebulized TC (300, 600, and 900 micrograms), placebo, and an active control drug (metaproterenol or cromolyn), followed by histamine or exercise challenge (two separate protocols). The results indicated that all doses of TC significantly blocked histamine-induced bronchoconstriction as compared with placebo. Overall, aerosolized TC was ineffective in blocking exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, although 900 micrograms TC tended to be more effective than placebo. Thiazinamium (900 micrograms) produced a modest bronchodilator effect. No clinically significant adverse effects related to TC occurred. We conclude that aerosolized TC is effective in attenuating histamine-induced but not exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in the doses studied. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the role of TC in asthma therapy.\r"

A double-blind, randomized, prospective study was conducted in a paramedic system comparing the use of methoxamine with epinephrine in enhancing conversion of ventricular fibrillation while otherwise following American Heart Association protocols. One hundred two patients in ventricular fibrillation not responding to initial defibrillations with a pulsatile rhythm were randomized into one of two groups, each containing 51 patients. Equipressor doses of epinephrine (0.5 mg) and methoxamine (5 mg) were given intravenously and repeated according to American Heart Association guidelines. The mean age, sex ratio, and mean paramedic response times were comparable for the two groups. The mean time at scene until conversion was 22 +/- 10 minutes for methoxamine and 17 +/- 7 minutes for epinephrine (P = NS). The methoxamine group received 3.1 +/- 1.4 doses as compared with 2.8 +/- 1.3 doses for the epinephrine group (P = NS). Conversion rate, defined as the percentage of patients who developed a pulse during resuscitation, was 27.5% for the methoxamine group and 49.0% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .03). Successful resuscitation, defined as the conveyance of a patient to an emergency department with a pulse and rhythm, was 17.7% for the methoxamine group and 39.2% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .02). Save rate, defined as the percentage of patients discharged alive after hospitalization, was 7.8% for the methoxamine group and 19.6% for the epinephrine group (P less than or equal to .07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Students using the program demonstrated a significantly higher level of diagnostic accuracy than a control group (one-tailed t test; N = 88; P less than .018). The success of the program was attributed in part to its unique application of advanced interactive software. Specifically, students use the software (an expert system shell) to develop a computer-based acute chest pain differential diagnostic protocol. Students can subsequently challenge their protocol with a number and variety of training cases in the program's data bank. The software interactively apprises students of the performance of their protocol in terms of its diagnostic accuracy against the cases. Students make protocol modifications to improve its diagnostic accuracy against the training cases. Interactive reassessments of the protocol's performance against the cases follow each modification. This repetitive cycle of protocol modifications rapidly followed by interactive performance reassessments against training cases appears to result in efficient and effective differential diagnostic skills improvements. A new generation of computer-based teaching and learning tools may have a significant impact on undergraduate clinical education.\r"

Seventy-one (59%) patients had one or more disagreeable characteristics identified. Forty (33%) patients vomited; 39 (33%) wore dentures; five (4%) had alcohol on their breath; and nine (7%) had visible blood. Of the 42 bystanders involved, 14 were exposed to one or more of the disagreeable characteristics. No bystander interviewed indicated hesitancy in performing CPR when encountering disagreeable characteristics. Seven bystanders stated they felt inadequately prepared to handle patients who vomited. Because of the high incidence of disagreeable characteristics, notably vomitus, in patients suffering a cardiac arrest, specific training in handling such characteristics seems justified.\r"

Patients who ingest mercury-containing button batteries should undergo chelation therapy and monitoring of levels only if symptoms characteristic of mercury toxicity develop. Cathartics and water-soluble enemas, although not indicated for intact button batteries, may be useful in speeding transit of mercury if it is released into the bowel.

  ".W": "The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been advocated by some to assist in the weaning process of patients receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The efficacy of this technique and its effect on respiratory system mechanics are not well understood. The theoretical advantage of CPAP or PEEP during the weaning process can be obliterated if excessive dynamic hyperinflation is induced. A key determinant of the individual response to this proposed weaning technique is the recognition of the presence or absence of expiratory flow limitation. We studied the effect of progressively increased levels of applied PEEP on isovolume expiratory flow and end-expiratory lung volume in seven patients during controlled mechanical ventilation. In the absence of expiratory flow limitation, passive expiratory flow decreased and end-expiratory lung volume increased when any level of PEEP was applied. In contrast, flow-limited patients did not demonstrate a change in isovolume expiratory flow or end-expiratory lung volume until the applied PEEP reduced the driving pressure for expiratory flow below a critical value. All patients demonstrated dynamic hyperinflation during controlled ventilation as evident by the existence of intrinsic PEEP. The nominal value of applied PEEP that caused a reduction in isovolume expiratory flow was unrelated to the initial level of intrinsic PEEP. The clinical implications of these findings with respect to CPAP therapy during weaning from mechanical ventilation are discussed.\r"

At baseline, mean (SD) peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was 62 (19)% of predicted normal values. The mean increase in morning PEFR 12 h after dosing was: for 450 mg, 14(17)%; for 300 mg, 8(23)%; for 150 mg, 2(11)%, for placebo 0(10)%. The increases over baseline for 450 mg and 300 mg compared with 150 mg and placebo were statistically significant. The mean asthma symptoms score (scale zero to 3) exhibited a dose-related reduction. Significantly less beta 2-receptor agonist inhalations were used in the 450-mg group than in the placebo group. There was a statistically significant increase in headache and nausea with the doses 450 mg and 300 mg given twice daily during the first treatment week compared with 150 mg and placebo. Subsequent to the first week, there were no differences between the active treatments and placebo with respect to the incidence of these and other side effects. We conclude that oral enprofylline, in a dosage of 300 to 450 mg twice daily is an effective and well-tolerated drug that may be useful in the maintenance therapy of asthma.\r"

In the present study, we investigated the effect of deferoxamine (DF), an iron chelator with antioxidant capacity, on paraquat toxicity in vitamin E-deficient rats. After the administration of paraquat at a dose of 20 mg/kg the animals were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of DF for 14 days. In a dose-response study, four of six animals receiving 100 mg DF/kg/24 h survived the study period of 14 days compared with none in the saline-treated control group (n = 6), and three and two animals in the groups receiving 50 (n = 6) and 200 mg DF/kg/24 h (n = 6), respectively. In another series of experiments, animals were monitored for a total period of 35 days, at which time any survivors were killed, and lung histologic examination was carried out. Deferoxamine treatment was started simultaneously (n = 21), 6 h (n = 18), and 16 h (n = 18) after paraquat poisoning. Percent survival in the various time-point groups was 47.7 (p less than 0.01), 38.9 (p less than 0.02), and 22.2 (not significant), respectively, compared with 7.1 (n = 14) in the control group. The presence of lung damage was seen only in those of the surviving rats where DF was started at the 16 h time point after paraquat administration. In ancillary in vitro studies, where Escherichia coli was used as a source of enzymic activity for the redox-cycling of paraquat, DF completely inhibited the formation of hydroxyl radical (.OH).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An open lung biopsy revealed interstitial pneumonitis with an abundance of vacuolated macrophages in the alveolar spaces. Ultrastructural analysis showed in the alveolar and interstitial spaces the accumulation of macrophages laden with electron-lucent bodies resembling plastic beads. An inhalation exposure history, taken subsequent to these findings, revealed exposure to high levels of acrylic plastic in a dental school laboratory. Removal from the site of exposure has resulted in the gradual resolution of the roentgenographic abnormalities.\r"

The concentration of methacholine (in mg/ml) necessary to increase specific airway resistance by 100%, PC100SRaw, and the number of leukocytes and neutrophils (in cells x 10(6)/ml) were measured before, and 8 and 16 days after chemotherapy. Mean (SEM) total number of leukocytes decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) from 9.0 (0.8) to 4.4 (0.6) and 3.4 (0.4), and mean (SEM) number of neutrophils decreased significantly (p less than 0.005) from 5.1 (0.7) to 2.8 (0.5) and 1.0 (0.4), respectively. Mean (SEM) PC100SRaw was 3.3 (0.9) at baseline and 3.5 (1.2) and 3.8 (1.0) mg/ml at Days 8 and 16, respectively, without significant differences. These data suggest that a significant chemotherapy-induced leukocyte depletion in the peripheral blood does not influence airway responsiveness in patients with chronic bronchitis and bronchial carcinoma.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, sham-controlled trial; patients were followed until their discharge from the hospital. SETTING: Urban, nonreferral county hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 75 patients who had a bloody nasogastric aspirate sample, melena, or hematochezia; unstable vital signs, a transfusion of at least two units of blood in 12 hours, or a drop in the hematocrit of at least 0.06 in 12 hours; and endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with a nonbleeding visible vessel. INTERVENTION: Sham or real multipolar electrocoagulation at the time of diagnostic endoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the group receiving multipolar electrocoagulation showed marked improvement in the following variables; rebleeding (18% compared with 41%, P less than 0.05; difference, 23%; 95% CI, 3% to 43%); need for emergency surgery (8% compared with 30%, P less than 0.05; difference, 22%; CI, 5% to 39%); mean number of hospital days (4.3 +/- 0.4 compared with 6.2 +/- 0.7, P less than 0.05; difference, 1.9; CI, 0.4 to 3.4); and cost of hospitalization ($3790 +/- $410 compared with $5730 +/- $650, P less than 0.05; difference, $1940; CI, $400 to $3480). The mean transfusion requirement in the treatment group was 1.6 +/- 0.3 as compared with 3.0 +/- 0.6 units in the control group (P = 0.13; difference, 1.4; CI, 0 to 2.8). The overall mortality was extremely low: Only 1 (1%) of 75 patients died. Bleeding was induced in 7 (18%) of the 38 patients treated with electrocoagulation, and 1 patient required urgent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment with multipolar electrocoagulation is beneficial in patients who present with major upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and are found to have an ulcer with a nonbleeding visible vessel.\r"

  ".W": "Although conferring a grave prognosis in patients with malignant lymphoma, high levels of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) are usually not seen in patients with multiple myeloma, a more indolent tumor composed mainly of B cells in their terminal stage of differentiation. Thus, only 2 of 118 patients in earlier phases of myeloma showed marked LDH elevations to more than 500 U/L, whereas such abnormalities were present in 12 of 64 patients with advanced disease progressing despite treatment with vincristine, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), dexamethasone (VAD) (median LDH level, 700 U/L). High LDH levels were associated with high serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin, hypercalcemia, extraosseous disease features, a short preceding clinical course as well as a short subsequent survival time. A poor prognosis was also noted in patients with lower LDH in whom marked increments were induced by high-dose chemotherapy; thus, LDH elevations to greater than 300 U/L present before or found after high-dose cytotoxic therapy were observed in about 50% of patients with VAD-resistant myeloma and define a new clinical entity with features of extraosseous disease and an unusually aggressive course (\"high-grade myeloma\"). The shorter survival of newly diagnosed patients with high-normal compared with those with low-normal LDH levels (less than 200 U/L), regardless of tumor mass, suggests the presence in some patients of a tumor subpopulation with high LDH production that escapes growth control with standard treatment. Staging of multiple myeloma should therefore include measurements of serum LDH levels in addition to beta-2-microglobulin analysis and tumor mass estimation.\r"

  ".W": "Increased neural inhibition appears to be an important component of the syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy. The pathways subserved by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex are the principal inhibitory systems in the mammalian brain. Hyperpolarization of neural membranes is accomplished by an increase in transmembrane chloride flux through a GABA-gated chloride channel in the complex. The opening of the chloride channel is induced by the binding of GABA to its receptors, and it is potentiated by barbiturates or benzodiazepines that act at distinct recognition sites on the complex. Involvement of the GABA neurotransmitter system in hepatic encephalopathy is suggested by several findings in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure. For example, hepatic encephalopathy resembles encephalopathies induced by drugs (including benzodiazepines) that potentiate GABAergic neurotransmission. In addition, neurons from animals with hepatic encephalopathy show increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine and GABA receptor agonists. Moreover, these neurons are excited by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists at concentrations that do not affect control neurons. Also, elevated levels of a substance that inhibits radioligand binding to benzodiazepine receptors have been found in cerebrospinal fluid from animals with hepatic encephalopathy. Furthermore, manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy can be ameliorated by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. The relevance of these findings to hepatic encephalopathy in human beings is supported by clinical observations showing that a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist can lessen the degree of hepatic encephalopathy. These findings suggest that an endogenous substance with benzodiazepine-like properties contributes to the neuropsychiatric manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy by augmenting GABAergic neurotransmission.\r"

  ".W": "Because coronary angioplasty is being increasingly used as a treatment for coronary artery disease, the proper evaluation and management of patients after the procedure are important issues. Although coronary angioplasty is a complex technical procedure, the methods routinely used to evaluate its results have many shortcomings. Although the initial results of the procedure are assessed most commonly by the visual interpretation of video images and coronary angiograms, quantitative angiography, trans-stenotic pressure gradients, and coronary flow reserve measurements have also been used. In the period after coronary angioplasty, success can be evaluated by patients' clinical improvement in symptoms and their stress responses to various functional tests. The management of the patient during the first 24 hours after angioplasty should focus on the prevention, detection, and, if necessary, treatment of acute vessel closure. During the subsequent 6 months, the emphasis should shift to the evaluation of recurrent symptoms and prevention of restenosis. We discuss the methods used to assess the results of coronary angioplasty and suggest guidelines for managing patients after the procedure.\r"

Approximately one third of the reported cases have also involved cleft lip and/or palate. Thirty cases of this syndrome have been reported in the pediatric and genetic literature, with variable expression of the syndrome characteristics. The purpose of this article is to report two additional cases of G syndrome with LTE cleft. A technique for repair of LTE cleft via a lateral pharyngeal approach is described. Although G syndrome is rare, otolaryngologists should be aware of its association with LTE cleft and its potential life-threatening problems.\r"

In three patients with posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation improvement in the auditory brain stem response occurred when cerebrospinal fluid was withdrawn. Intermittent withdrawal of cerebrospinal fluid (by ventricular tap or lumbar puncture) in two of these infants was followed by improvement in the auditory brain stem response after a period of 24 hours (but not sooner).

  ".W": "Morbid obesity is a major health problem in this country and throughout the world. In addition to its social stigma (in the western world), obesity exacerbates several disease states such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease and restrictive lung disease. When effective medical treatment of obesity becomes available, it will depend in part upon understanding the physiologic factors that control satiety. This review summarizes the information available on brain and gut control mechanisms of satiety. Brain nuclei located in the lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus, and other paraventricular areas are the sites of action for potent neuropeptides, such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and neuropeptide Y, that appear to regulate feeding. Exogenous CCK has been used clinically to decrease meal size in obese patients. The sites of the satiety cascade that are most often manipulated are the gastric and intestinal phases. Physiologic gastric distension is a potent inhibitor of feeding, whereas the intermeal interval may be regulated by intestinal signals released by food in the gut. Jejunal-ileal bypass has fallen from favor and has been replaced by gastric restrictive procedures that create a small proximal gastric pouch that empties into the small bowel (gastric bypass) or the distal stomach (gastroplasty). These operations rely partially on their ability to produce gastric distension in the proximal gastric pouch at an early stage during a meal. Thus, failure results if the pouch compensates by distending or if the stoma widens with subsequent loss of slow emptying. Improved medical and surgical treatment will be designed to intervene at specific sites of the satiety cascade as knowledge of the physiologic control mechanisms of satiety increases.\r"

Before treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in age, sex, smoking habits, symptom duration of claudication, ankle-arm blood pressure quotient (ankle-index), maximal plethysmographic calf blood flow, symptom-free and maximal walking distance, the history of other atherosclerotic manifestations or in the medical treatment. The walking performance was improved in all three groups at follow-up 13 +/- 0.5 months after randomization. Surgery was most effective, but the addition of training to surgery improved the symptom-free walking distance even further. In pooled observations of the three groups, age, symptom duration, and a history of myocardial ischemic disease correlated negatively with walking performance after treatment. In the operated group, the duration of claudication and a history of myocardial ischemic disease correlated negatively with the walking performance. This was not the case when patients were censored if limited by other symptoms than intermittent claudication after treatment. In the trained group, the duration of claudication correlated negatively to symptom-free and maximal walking distance. Ankle-index and maximal plethysmographic calf blood flow after treatment and the change of these variables with treatment correlated positively with both symptom-free and maximal walking distance when results were pooled for all patients. Although this mainly was a consequence of the improved blood flow after surgery, the change of maximal plethysmographic calf blood flow also correlated with symptom-free but not with maximal walking distance in the trained group. The results demonstrate that, compared with physical training alone, operation alone or in combination with subsequent training are superior treatment modalities in patients with intermittent claudication.\r"

  ".W": "Mesenteric traction syndrome consists of sudden tachycardia, hypotension, and cutaneous hyperemia, and frequently occurs during mesenteric traction in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) reconstructive surgery. The etiology and clinical impact of this phenomenon are unknown, but the symptoms suggest a release of vasoactive materials from the mesenteric vascular bed. Thirty-one patients who underwent AAA surgery were studied. Mesenteric traction was accompanied by a decrease in systolic (p = 0.005) and diastolic (p less than 0.05) blood pressures, and in systemic vascular resistance (p less than 0.005), and was accompanied by an increase in heart rate (HR) (p less than 0.005), and cardiac output (p = 0.01). These hemodynamic changes coincided with an increase (p less than 0.001) in plasma concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 (6-K-PGF1). No apparent change was found in prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, and histamine concentrations. The concentration of 6-K-PGF1 was correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.52, p less than 0.005) and HR (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). Cutaneous hyperemia was observed in 58% of the patients. In an additional six patients, who had taken aspirin daily before AAA surgery, no significant changes were observed in the hemodynamic measurements or 6-K-PGF1 concentrations. These data suggest that mesenteric traction syndrome may be mediated at least in part by a selective release of prostacyclin.\r"

All deaths except one occurred in the polytraumatized group. The policy of subjecting victims of terrorist bomb explosions to triage and stabilization before hospitalization is compared to the so-called \"scoop and run\" technique, more generally applied in mass casualty situations.

The DMD group required an average increase of 0.95 hours in their daily use of assisted ventilation per year. Their overall average length of survival was increased from 19 years 9 months to 25 years 9 months. Members of the postpolio group, to date, have shown no significant decrease in muscle strength nor have they needed more than nocturnal ventilation. Recommended evaluation and pulmonary follow-up for patients with CRF secondary to neuromuscular disease is outlined. Most of these patients can be managed for a number of years with body ventilators before a tracheotomy is necessary.\r"

The purpose of this study was to measure isokinetic strength in nonathletic able-bodied subjects to provide a subsequent comparison with nonathletic injured patients. Using a standard isokinetic protocol, with continuous verbal encouragement, a single investigator tested 16 women and nine men aged 20 to 30 years on an isokinetic dynamometer. Subjects had minimal athletic experience, and none were varsity performers. Peak torque as a percentage of body weight was statistically greater for men than for women in most joints tested both at 60 degrees and 180 degrees per second. The ratio of the last five to the first five of 25 repetitions at 180 degrees/second (Endurance Ratio = ER) rarely (ie, 5/154 tests) fell below the commonly accepted value of 50%. Many subjects had an endurance ratio of 100% or greater (range 4% to 171%). Peak torques were well below and endurance ratios well above those published for similarly aged athletes. The results suggest that before isokinetic testing is considered as a possible way to distinguish malingerers among injured patients, normal values in an age-matched, nonathletic, working population should be clearly defined. The endurance ratio may reflect the level of athletic training or the level of vigorous participation in an exercise program.\r"

When resorption exceeds formation, bone mass is reduced--a process that leads to osteopenia or osteoporosis. Osteopenia is reduced bone mass and osteoporosis is reduced bone mass with resultant fractures. Reduced bone mass may be postmenopausal or related to ovarian failure (type I osteoporosis), it may be age-related (type II osteoporosis), or it may result from several other etiologic factors (secondary osteoporosis). Disuse and inactivity can cause bone loss, whereas weight-bearing exercises may maintain or improve bone mineral density. There is a significant correlation between muscle strength and bone mineral density. There is evidence that strengthening exercises may lead to an increase in the mineral density of the bones to which the muscles are attached. Currently, drug regimens are available to decrease or halt bone loss in osteoporotic patients. Properly designed exercise programs may prove to be effective for retarding age-related bone loss. In patients with osteoporosis, the cause should be investigated before treatment is commenced.\r"

However, a myopic shift of 2.0 D occurred between six months and 1 1/2 years in very young children following refractive surgery. The corneal curvature was measured only in older children and showed an average increase of 10.7 D. Visual acuity results in verbal patients were comparable to those in patients with contact lenses.

Of the 32 eyes that were anatomically successful, 20 eyes in 19 patients were able to achieve satisfactory visual improvement requiring either no correction or spectacle lenses. Twelve eyes in 11 patients were successfully refit with contact lenses for anisometropic refractive errors (11 eyes) and residual irregular astigmatism (one eye). Three patients (two in the non-contact lens group and one in the contact lens group) have subsequently undergone penetrating keratoplasty for further visual improvement. Our data suggest that the majority of keratoconic epikeratoplasties achieve a satisfactory visual result either unaided or with spectacles; however, those patients who wish to resume contact lens wear may do so successfully.\r"

The issues of clinical trials and access to therapeutic drugs pose dilemmas for researchers, physicians, and AIDS patients and their families. Clinical trials are conducted for two related but separate purposes: definitive identification of which experimental drugs work and which do not (in scientifically controlled trials performed by clinical researchers); and to provide data as to whether drugs are safe and effective so that they can be licensed and made available (determined by the Federal Drug Administration). The public must be made aware of the distinction between the two processes and of the need for strict control of the procedures in each. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recognizing the need for greater access to clinical trials of investigational drugs by a broader spectrum of the infected population, is establishing the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS. This national program will involve greater participation by community physicians and patients in the design and implementation of AIDS-related research projects. Further, the institute is committed to addressing the implications of the disproportionate representation of blacks and Hispanics among people with AIDS. More minority patients, researchers, and physicians must be brought into the clinical trials of AIDS therapies.\r"

  ".W": "Two developments profoundly modified the single mission of U.S. medical schools to educate physicians: the decision of the federal government to develop federal research programs within the nation's universities rather than in separate research institutes; and the entry of the federal government into the purchase of health services through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The presence of biomedical research in the schools has created dilemmas for educators and administrators. The schools need to deploy large amounts of capital for research, they find a decreasing relevance of new research knowledge to medical practice, and they see a great need to increase interdepartmental collaboration. These factors create a new kind of tension that may make the medical school of the next generation less attractive as the exclusive institution in which biomedical research is conducted within the university. At the same time, cuts in federal funding for health services have caused medical schools to organize their faculties into practice plans. If the plans feel cuts in income because of federal reimbursement mandates, there will probably be controversy among faculty members about the plans' continuing contributions to the schools. A hypothetical scenario illustrates the plight of a medical school faced with a significant reduction in funds to support health services.\r"

Some of the advances in information technology may help physicians to manage information more effectively through more accessible, validated clinical indexes, data bases of diagnostic test characteristics, computerized audits of clinical activities with feedback, expert systems, on-line access to the medical literature, and other tools of medical informatics. Medical educators can catalyze this process by facilitating the introduction of information technology into academic clinical settings so that students can learn its use first-hand and by promoting the evolution of this and other aspects of medical informatics, a new discipline dedicated to the solution of information problems in health care. The potential roles for computer-aided instruction and centralized computer laboratories in medical schools are much less clear.\r"

  ".W": "After a brief historic survey, sympathetic-neurogenic contributions to the multifactorial, polygenetically linked etiology of primary (essential) hypertension are outlined towards the background of experimental findings both in various rat models and in human subjects. It is emphasized how at least some variants of both human and rat primary hypertension show a genetically linked, central nervous system (CNS)-dependent increase of responsiveness to ordinary daily psychosocial stimuli. Such influences, conveyed by way of neurohormonal response patterns, seem to act in concert with cardiovascular structural adaptation, also sometimes genetically reinforced, so as to gradually elevate the pressure equilibrium until a state of \"established\" hypertension is reached. However, also in variants characterized by, eg, a genetically increased sensitivity to salt intake of renal or other origin, neurohormonal mechanisms seem to be involved early, though probably via other types of central mechanisms, thereby helping to convey the pressure-elevating influences of the altered salt-volume handling. Evidence is now at hand to indicate that these two \"environmental factors,\" ie, excitatory psychosocial influences and increased salt intake, which at least partly operate via different genetic elements, are in fact closely intertwined, and even mutually reinforcing as to their actions. It is also briefly outlined how neurogenic contributions seem to vary in extent and type of impact, not only between different variants of hypertension but also along with the stage of disorder, probably being, in most cases, particularly important in the early stages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During the past 15 years there has been a striking increase in the understanding of the molecular basis of cellular response to catecholamines. In addition to the two principal subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta 1 and beta 2), there are at least two (alpha 1, alpha 2) and very likely additional subtypes of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The discovery of guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins as transducers of receptor occupancy to activation of second messenger systems provides a common theme in cellular regulation by catecholamines. Application of techniques such as radioligand binding and photoaffinity labeling have facilitated the direct identification, quantitation, and ultimately purification of alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, and beta 2 receptors. Each is a plasma membrane glycoprotein with a subunit molecular weight (without the carbohydrate portion of the glycoprotein) of 40,000 to 55,000 kDa. The recent cloning and sequencing of cDNAs for alpha 2-, beta 1-, and beta 2-adrenergic receptors has revealed that although each has a unique molecular structure, they appear to share several common features, including extracellular amino terminus, seven plasma membrane spanning domains, and intracellular carboxy terminus. The application of molecular biological techniques together with antireceptor antibodies, which will allow studies of adrenergic receptors independent of binding or functional properties, should help in answering the many unresolved questions related to activation and regulation of adrenergic receptors. Foremost among these is whether diseases such as hypertension are characterized by alterations in one or more adrenergic receptor subtypes.\r"

In addition, bilateral complete renal denervation delays the development and/or attenuates the magnitude of the hypertension in several different forms of experimental hypertension in animals. Efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity is known to have dose-dependent effects on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption, and renin secretion rate that are capable of contributing, singly or in combination, to the development, maintenance, and exacerbation of the hypertensive state. Of the many factors known to influence the central nervous system integrative regulation of ERSNA, two environmental factors, dietary sodium intake and environmental stress, are capable of significant interaction. This resultant increase in ERSNA and subsequent renal functional alterations can participate in the hypertensive process. This is especially evident in the presence of an underlying genetic predisposition to the development of hypertension. Thus, interactions between environmental and genetic influences can produce alterations in the sympathetic neural control of renal function that play an important role in hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The association of hypertension and obesity is poorly understood. Studies conducted in our laboratory over the last decade, in conjunction with recent clinical and epidemiological observations, suggest that hypertension in the obese is derived from a fundamental relationship between dietary intake and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The application of kinetic techniques to the measurement of norepinephrine (NE) turnover rate in sympathetically innervated tissues of laboratory rodents has defined a relationship between the SNS and dietary intake. Fasting or caloric restriction suppresses sympathetic activity in a variety of organs of the rat, including heart and interscapular brown adipose tissue. Overfeeding a mixed, palatable, \"cafeteria\" diet stimulates sympathetic activity in these same tissues. The stimulatory effect of mixed diets is due to the carbohydrate and fat content, because these two latter nutrients stimulate sympathetic activity even when total caloric intake is not increased. Insulin-mediated glucose metabolism within central neurons associated with the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) plays an important role in the relationship between dietary intake and SNS activity as indicated by the following observations: (1) Hypoglycemia (noninsulin-mediated) is associated with suppression of the SNS (despite concomitant adrenal medullary stimulation); (2) 2-deoxyglucose, an intracellular inhibitor of glucose metabolism, decreases sympathetic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean total norepinephrine (NE) spillover in hypertensive patients was 418 ng/min, 42% (124 ng/min) higher than in subjects with normal blood pressure (BP)(P less than .05). Norepinephrine spillover among hypertensive patients was a function of age, only being elevated in patients under 40 years of age. Half of the excess in total norepinephrine release in hypertensive patients was accounted for by increased cardiorenal spillover. Mean renal norepinephrine spillover was 120 ng/min, compared with 69 ng/min in healthy subjects (P less than .02). Renal spillover was highest in younger patients. Corresponding cardiac norepinephrine spillover values were 12.6 ng/min and 5.1 ng/min (P less than .01). The balance of the excess total norepinephrine spillover comes from undetermined sites, but not the lungs or hepatomesenteric circulation. These measurements of regional norepinephrine overflow suggest that sympathetic nervous outflow to the kidneys and heart is selectively activated in early hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The sympathetic nervous system has a key role in the physiological regulation of the circulation and may also mediate some of the factors that cause or sustain clinical hypertension. Most classes of antihypertensive drugs produce at least part of their effects by inhibitory actions on the sympathetic pathways. The centrally acting agents and the peripheral alpha-adrenergic blockers are the most specific currently used sympathetic inhibitors. The available alpha-blockers, prazosin and terazosin, effectively reduce blood pressure when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. When given once daily, the actions of terazosin persist throughout the full 24-hour period, including the important midmorning hours when there may be heightened sympathetic activity. The incidence of symptomatic adverse effects with the alpha-blockers is low. Because they specifically block peripheral alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, the alpha-blockers decrease total peripheral resistance at rest and do not antagonize the appropriate vasodilatory responses to exercise. They maintain or increase blood flow in regional circulations; cerebral blood flow in elderly patients is unchanged despite significant decreases in systemic blood pressure. In contrast to other drug classes that can adversely affect the lipid profile, the alpha-blockers slightly decrease total cholesterol concentrations. Recent studies also have shown that terazosin and prazosin can promote decreases in echocardiographically measured left ventricular wall thickness and muscle mass in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, this type of sympathetic blockade not only produces antihypertensive effects, but additionally may have a beneficial impact upon other cardiovascular risk factors.\r"

In total, 264 children, aged 1 to 10 years, were randomly assigned to either antibiotic or placebo treatment; 43 patients were excluded during treatment, equally distributed in both groups, leaving 221 patients completing the trial. The inclusion criterion was a type C2 and type B tympanometry result of at least three months' duration. Tympanometry was performed every month for 12 additional months. At the end of the treatment period, the disease was reversed in 61% in the antibiotic-treated group compared with 30% in the placebo-treated group (P less than .0001), and the improvement was persistently significant in favor of antibiotic for eight months. The effect was present in all age groups and independent of laterality of disease. The middle-ear status at the end of treatment was the determining factor for the outcome of tympanometry the year following treatment. From the end of treatment, there was no difference between tympanometry in a patient having been treated with the antibiotic and a patient having been treated with placebo. Antibiotic treatment shifts the individual patient from poor to better tympanometric conditions, so antibiotics can be recommended in the treatment of secretory otitis media before inserting ventilating tubes.\r"

There was a marked reciprocal relationship between PaO2 and the alveolar deadspace fraction. In children with a normal pulmonary circulation and good oxygenation, alveolar deadspace fraction was approx. 0.05. Shunts which reduced PaO2 to 10 kPa produced a deadspace fraction of 0.15. When PaO2 was 3-4 kPa, alveolar deadspace fraction was approx. 0.4. In well-oxygenated children, alveolar deadspace fraction was only slightly greater than predicted by a model of the effects of pure right-to-left shunting. In severely cyanotic children, the discrepancy between predicted and observed VDalv/VTalv was greater. The mean arterial-end-tidal CO2 difference was zero in children in whom PaO2 was greater than 10 kPa, despite a measurable alveolar deadspace. In severely hypoxic children, the difference was 1-2 kPa. In a retrospective analysis of published data from anaesthetized adults without intracardiac shunting, no relationship was found between alveolar deadspace and PaO2.\r"

Labetalol in a dose of 100 mg three times daily, increasing to 200 mg three times daily where required, significantly reduced maternal mean arterial pressure. There was some reduction in preterm delivery, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and jaundice in the labetalol-treated group. Intrauterine growth retardation and neonatal hypoglycaemia occurred with the same frequency in both groups. There were no perinatal deaths. Labetalol appears to be an effective agent in the management of mild to moderate pregnancy-induced hypertension. The data from this study suggest possible advantages and no apparent disadvantages for the fetus during its use.\r"

Of the respondents 92% prescribed two or three routine ultrasound examinations; only one doctor did not use electronic fetal monitoring and 99% of the respondents prescribed beta-mimetics to prevent preterm delivery. Some obstetricians reported a decrease in their use of ultrasound and more dramatically in the use of beta-mimetics. Side-effects were reported to be the major reason for the change in beta-mimetic use. Obstetricians who read English language journals were more likely to have reduced their use of ultrasound and beta-mimetics than those who read only French language journals.\r"

The estimates of risk were derived from published data and the AFP results from nine affected and 145 unaffected pregnancies in which repeat testing had been carried out. Repeat AFP testing is unjustified in antenatal screening programmes for Down's syndrome, but if a second test happens to have been done, the appropriate estimate of risk that would be applicable when counselling individual patients depends on both results. For example a woman aged 35 years and 6 months with a first AFP level of 0.50 multiples of the normal median (MoM) was estimated to have a risk of 1:172. If a second test were done on a fresh sample and the AFP level were 0.80 MoM then the estimated risk would be 1:216 which is higher than the estimated risk of 1:353 obtained if the second test were regarded as the only result. Estimates of risk are given for maternal serum AFP results in first and second tests ranging from 0.40 to 2.50 MoM.\r"

Twenty-seven women in labour, 16 with an epidural block (epidural group) and 11 with painful contractions (non-epidural group) were studied through several contractions in the lateral and supine position. In the non-epidural group, blood velocities showed large fluctuations, typical of temperature regulation, between contractions. During contractions, velocities were reduced by 80% in both positions, most likely due to vasoconstriction caused by pain. Radial artery measurements illustrated the same fluctuations between, and reductions during, contractions. In the epidural group, blood velocities were steadily high without fluctuations between contractions, illustrating sympathetic nerve blockade. In 14 of the 16 women, velocities remained high during contractions; in the remaining two women velocities decreased, mainly in systole, during contractions in the supine but not in the lateral position without concomitant fetal heart rate pathology.\r"

Methods of helping the couple during this time include acknowledging the significance of the loss, providing information, permitting the couple to see the fetus, if desired, and suggesting a memorial service. Some women may require individual or group therapy to deal with their feelings.\r"

The remission induction rate has changed from 58% in 1972 to 1975 to 80% for the period 1980 to 1983, and the induction mortality dropped from 20% to 6%. Four-year survival probabilities from time of diagnosis have almost doubled from 19% to 36%. Few deaths occurred more than 5 years after diagnosis: children surviving in first remission beyond 5 years had a 92% survival rate and an 86% relapse-free survival rate over the next 5 years. In contrast, median survival after a marrow relapse was less than 6 months and the 6-year survival probability was 4%. The leukocyte count was a significant prognostic factor, and although the mortality for infants was high initially, long-term survival was not decreased.\r"

The first combination was given to 19 patients. Oncolytic response and marrow hypoplasia was achieved in all. There were four early infectious deaths. Thirteen of the remaining 15 (87%) in whom the response to therapy could be evaluated achieved complete remission. Two achieved good partial remissions. The median duration of complete remission and survival on study was 8 and 10 months, respectively. The four proven and three suspected fungal infections seen in the initial 19 patients was the major toxicity observed. The therapy was modified in the last 15 patients to retain efficacy while reducing the period of neutropenia from a median of 28 to 22 days. No deep-seated fungal infections were seen in these patients. Twelve (80%) achieved a complete remission. Three had an oncolytic response without achieving remission. Eighty-three percent of the 30 evaluable patients, or 74% of all patients entered on study, achieved remission. It is anticipated that the therapy described here will not only achieve another remission in the majority of patients with advanced ALL but that the patients will be able to proceed to alternate therapies with potentially more durable benefit.\r"

Analysis of these cases and similar documented cases suggests that meningiomas after high-dose irradiation constitute a recognizable entity. Patients with such tumors received radiation therapy at a young age (mean age, 9.4 years). After a latent period of 2 to 47 years (mean, 19.8 years) they developed meningiomas at the site of irradiation, at a much younger age than patients with \"spontaneous\" meningiomas. Similar to the situation with meningiomas after low-dose irradiation, a relatively high proportion of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation tend to be malignant and biologically aggressive. A very young age at the time of irradiation seems to predispose to the induction of malignant meningiomas, rather than benign tumors. These unusual features provide indirect evidence that high-dose radiation may play a role in the pathogenesis of meningiomas.\r"

By indirect immunofluorescent assay with MRK16 antibody P-glycoprotein was not detected in 30 samples from 18 patients (I: 13, R: 17). Thus, P-glycoprotein expression and mdr1 gene amplification occurred infrequently not only in leukemia cells at the initial presentation but also in those at the relapsed cases and may not be a major cause of refractoriness to antileukemia drugs in adult acute leukemia.\r"

Compared with the carcinomas in groups 1 and 2, those in group 3 had significantly higher rates of infiltrative gross type, microscopically infiltrative type, poorly differentiated type, scirrhous type, and deep invading type. These results suggest that carcinomas in group 3 may have more proliferative and invasive activity and thus may have an autocrine mechanism, that is, the ability of cancer cells to produce and respond to their own growth factor.\r"

A dramatic decrease in serum CRP levels was found in two HCC patients receiving a successful surgical tumor resection, four cirrhotic patients recovering from complications, and all six patients with common bile duct stones and cholangitis controlled by antibiotics, but not in untreated HCC or other malignancy patients. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels correlated poorly with CRP levels. A combination of these two serum markers identified 94% of 104 patients with HCC. Since serum CRP levels were also abnormal in 57% of 14 patients with resectable HCC (less than or equal to 5 cm), in conjunction with AFP, it may be useful in the diagnosis of HCC or other malignancies.\r"

Upon statistical analysis of the correlations between p21 overexpression and patient prognosis with the Kaplan-Meier method and generalized Wilcoxon text, the p21-positive K and LNK types showed poorer prognosis, whereas the positive S type showed better prognosis in comparison with the negative cases. These findings suggest that the expression of ras p21 is one of the parameters related with prognosis of cervical cancers, but the mode of the correlation is dependent on their histologic types.\r"

In 20 of 34 cases (59%), varying numbers of Ki-67-positive tumor cells were detected with a range from 5 to 382 per 10 high power fields (HPF) (mean 57.2/10 HPF). Ki-67 index (the number of Ki-67-positive tumor cells/10 HPF) positively correlated with mitotic count (r = 0.428, P less than 0.02), cellularity (r = 0.447, P less than 0.01), and histologic grade (r = 0.473, P less than 0.01). The Ki-67 low index group (less than 50/10 HPF) showed more favorable prognosis than the high index group (more than 50/10 HPF) (P less than 0.005). Three cases with low mitotic count and unfavorable prognosis were proved to be the Ki-67 high index group (142-382/10 HPF). These results indicated that reactivity of tumor cells for Ki-67 is a useful prognostic marker in the patients with STS, and might be used as one of the histologic factors for the grading of STS.\r"

The baby was delivered by Cesarean section and her leukemia underwent spontaneous remission. However, 3 months later, she presented with massive painful leukemic infiltration of the breasts as initial manifestation of relapse, followed by systemic symptoms of leukemia. In vitro culture of the leukemic cells demonstrated characteristics of macrophage cell line. This case illustrates a unique sequence of events: spontaneous remission after the termination of pregnancy, which has profound hormonal alterations, and relapse in a very hormone-sensitive organ, the breast, a few months later when the hormonal milieu was resumed. This suggests hormonal dependence of her leukemic cells and potential for hormonal manipulation in a certain subset of human leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Information obtained during the past decade suggests the need to reexamine the possibility that the onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death is frequently triggered by daily activities. The importance of physical or mental stress in triggering onset of coronary thrombosis is supported by the findings that 1) the frequencies of onset of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and stroke show marked circadian variations with parallel increases in the period from 6:00 AM to noon, 2) transient myocardial ischemia shows a similar morning increase, and episodes are often preceded by mental or physical triggers, 3) a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, often nonobstructive by itself, lies at the base of most coronary thrombi, 4) a number of physiologic processes that could lead to plaque rupture, a hypercoagulable state or coronary vasoconstriction, are accentuated in the morning, and 5) aspirin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents, which block certain of these processes, have been shown to prevent disease onset. The hypothesis is presented that occlusive coronary thrombosis occurs when 1) an atherosclerotic plaque becomes vulnerable to rupture, 2) mental or physical stress causes the plaque to rupture, and 3) increases in coagulability or vasoconstriction, triggered by daily activities, contribute to complete occlusion of the coronary artery lumen. Recognition of the circadian variation--and the possibility of frequent triggering--of onset of acute disease suggests the need for pharmacologic protection of patients during vulnerable periods, and provides clues to mechanism, the investigations of which may lead to improved methods of prevention.\r"

  ".U": "89168689\r", 
  ".W": "Our purpose was to determine if there are basal adrenergic influences on the coronary circulation in humans. We studied 56 patients with denervated hearts after cardiac transplantation and 19 normally innervated patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Coronary blood flow velocity was measured during cardiac catheterization with a subselective 3F intracoronary Doppler catheter. Heart rate was controlled by atrial pacing. Epicardial coronary artery diameter was measured by automated analysis of digital coronary angiograms. Coronary flow reserve was assessed by intracoronary papaverine hydrochloride (12 mg) injections. Regional sympathetic blockade was produced by intracoronary injections of phentolamine (3 mg, alpha) and propranolol (2 mg, beta) or metoprolol (3 mg, beta 1). After alpha-blockade, mean arterial pressure fell significantly (p less than 0.05) in both the denervated transplant (-5.8 +/- 1.5%) (mean +/- SEM) and normally innervated patients (-12.6 +/- 3.2%). Reductions in coronary flow velocity also were observed in these groups (-8.2 +/- 2.3% and -9.2 +/- 5.8%, respectively). Calculated coronary vascular resistance was unchanged. Similar changes were seen when patients were pretreated with beta-blockade before alpha-blockade. Nonspecific beta-blockade did not affect mean arterial pressure but decreased coronary velocity (innervated, -11.6 +/- 3.9%; denervated, -9.3 +/- 2.4%) and increased coronary vascular resistance (innervated, 15.4 +/- 6.7%; denervated, 10.2 +/- 3.7%). Coronary vascular resistance did not rise in either group after selective beta 1-blockade with metoprolol. Coronary flow reserve did not change in either patient group after either alpha- or beta-blockade. Changes in epicardial coronary artery diameter were small and generally not significant. These data suggest that alpha-receptor-mediated vascular tone is negligible in both denervated transplant patients and normally innervated patients. Additionally, the increase in vascular resistance after nonselective beta-blockade is the result of direct beta 2 vascular effects. Our data further suggest that there is little adrenergically mediated epicardial artery tone (either humoral or neural) at rest and that maximal vasodilator responses are not limited by adrenergically mediated vasomotor tone.\r"

  ".W": "Duplex scanning has been proposed as a safe alternative to contrast venography for diagnosing deep venous thrombosis, but its accuracy has not been proved. In this prospective, double-blind study of 47 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of duplex scan criteria were determined relative to contrast venography for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Criteria considered to show the presence of deep venous thrombosis included visualization of thrombus (T), absence of spontaneous flow by Doppler ultrasonography (F), absence of phasicity of flow with respiration (P), and incompressibility of the vein with probe pressure (VC). When analyzed individually, the variables T and F had low sensitivities (50% and 76%) but high specificities (92% and 100%). VC had low values for both (79% and 67%, respectively). The best single variable was P (sensitivity and specificity = 92%). The best combinations of variables were T+P (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 83%), T+F+P (sensitivity = 95%, specificity = 83%), F+P (sensitivity and specificity = 92%), and F+T (sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 87%). The low specificity of vein incompressibility was secondary to cases in which normal veins were difficult to compress in the thigh. All false-negative cases were from isolated calf vein thrombi. We conclude that isolated criteria from duplex scanning should not be used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis. In cases of suspected calf vein thrombosis, repeat duplex examination should be obtained in 3-4 days to determine the most appropriate therapy. In equivocal cases of proximal vein thrombosis, a contrast venogram should be obtained.\r"

The rigidity of external fixation, including pin-bone interface stresses, is discussed and bone healing and remodeling under different fixation stiffnesses and fracture gap conditions are described. The rigidity of fixation ultimately depends on the biomechanical characteristics of the fracture, the accuracy of reduction, and the amount of physiologic loading. Comparative experiments using a canine tibial fracture model have suggested that fixation rigidity is important in early bone healing and in the prevention of pin loosening. Bone union can be achieved under external fixation through different pathways, ranging from callus-free gap healing under a rigid neutralization configuration to direct-contact healing with periosteal new bone formation under axially dynamized stable fixation. Cortical reconstruction by secondary osteons seems to be important for the ultimate strength of the bone union.\r"

Apart from an elevation in the plasma immunoreactive insulin levels (4.1 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/l, P less than 0.025), there were no significant differences among the other parameters compared with age-matched controls up to week 12 for the normal rats on chloroquine treatment. After 20 weeks of treatment, however, plasma glucose (7.2 +/- 0.1 vs 8.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P less than 0.005) and glycated haemoglobin (2.9 +/- 0.1 vs 3.3 +/- 0.1%, P less than 0.01) levels were lower in the treated animals. Diabetic rats treated with chloroquine for 12 weeks before the onset of diabetes showed significantly higher plasma insulin and protein levels than control diabetic animals, while plasma glucose (17.7 +/- 2.5 vs 29.4 +/- 1.7 mmol/l, P less than 0.005), glycated plasma protein and glycated haemoglobin (6.6 +/- 0.4 vs 7.8 +/- 0.4%, P less than 0.05) levels were lower. 3. It is concluded that after a prolonged administration of chloroquine there is a hypoglycaemic effect in normal animals, and pretreatment with the drug ameliorates diabetes induced subsequently.\r"

Eleven infants and children (mean age 4.3 years, range 0.2-12 years) with pulmonary vascular disease secondary to congenital cardiac anomalies (n = 6) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 5), were studied during cardiac catheterization while ventilated on 100% oxygen. 2. All had a raised pulmonary vascular resistance (mean 11.8 units, range 4.1-26.0 units, normal value less than 3 units) and a raised anatomical intrapulmonary right to left shunt (mean 22%, range 8-50%, normal value less than 5%). The elevated shunt was attributed to the effects of 100% oxygen and general anaesthesia causing alveolar collapse, with only partial compensation for impairment of gas exchange by compensatory local hypoxic vasoconstriction. 3. When prostacyclin was infused, pulmonary vascular resistance fell by 3.2 +/- 1.8 units (mmHg litre-1 min m2), and pulmonary blood flow rose by 1.0 +/- 0.7 litre min-1 m-2 (mean +/- 95% confidence intervals). 4. Intrapulmonary right to left shunt fraction increased in eight of 11 patients, with a maximal rise for the group of 5.9 +/- 4.6% (mean +/- 95% confidence intervals). However, even at doses of prostacyclin sufficient to cause systemic vasodilatation and tachycardia, there was no evidence for a selective increase in shunt fraction. 5. We suggest that studying the effects of therapeutic interventions on intrapulmonary shunt fraction may be a useful model in vivo of human hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.\r"

The total activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.88) in liver was increased by sepsis, but there was no significant change in the expressed activity. Short-term insulin deficiency (induced by mannoheptulose or streptozotocin) decreased the rates of cholesterogenesis and fatty acid synthesis in livers of septic rats but did not alter the expressed/total activity of HMG-CoA reductase. 3. It is concluded that the increased rate of hepatic cholesterogenesis in septic rats is in part a result of the higher plasma insulin, the hormone acting to maintain the total activity of HMG-CoA reductase and to stimulate a step before the formation of HMG-CoA. 4. These changes may contribute to the hypertriacylglycerolaemia associated with sepsis.\r"

Both the peroxisomal, flavin-linked glycollate oxidase [(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase; EC 1.1.3.15] and the cytosolic, nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-linked lactate dehydrogenase (L-lactate dehydrogenase; EC 1.1.1.27) are thought to contribute to the formation of oxalate from its immediate precursors, glycollate and glyoxylate, but the relative contributions of each enzyme to endogenous oxalate production is not known. 2. In rat liver homogenates, [14C]oxalate production from labelled glycollate is halved and that from labelled glyoxylate is increased fourfold by the addition of either NAD or NADH. 3. In isolated rat hepatocytes, the 3-hydroxy-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione derivatives of glycollate, which are specific inhibitors of glycollate oxidase, have a greater effect on glycollate metabolism than on glyoxylate metabolism. 4. These findings are consistent with an important role for lactate dehydrogenase in oxalate formation from glyoxylate. 5. With human and rat liver homogenates and with purified human liver glycollate oxidase and rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, DL-phenyl-lactate (2 mmol/l) completely inhibits glycollate oxidase but has not effect on lactate dehydrogenase. On the other hand, the reduced form of a chemically synthesized, NAD-pyruvate adduct (1 mmol/l) almost completely inhibited lactate dehydrogenase but had no effect on glycollate oxidase. 6. Either alone or in combination, DL-phenyl-lactate and reduced NAD-pyruvate adduct reduce oxalate production from glycollate and glyoxylate in isolated rat hepatocytes, but do not abolish it completely. 7. These findings support a role for another enzyme, probably glycollate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.14), in oxalate production in integrated cell metabolism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the CDC has supported programs for standardizing lipid measurements for more than 30 years. These programs were begun because comparable and accurate quantitative measurements were needed for epidemiologic studies of coronary heart disease. Since the first program was initiated, over 500 national and international laboratories have participated in the various CDC lipid standardization programs. The cornerstone of these standardization programs has been an accuracy base of lipid reference materials and methods developed by CDC. Specifically, CDC has developed human, serum-based reference materials for cholesterol, HDL, triglyceride, and apolipoproteins A-I and B and reference methods for total cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride. The CDC reference method for cholesterol has been adopted as the national reference method for cholesterol by the National Reference System for the Clinical Laboratory Council of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The approved CDC reference method along with an approved NBS definitive method, an approved NBS certified Reference Material, and the CDC certified serum-based secondary reference materials make up the accuracy base for serum cholesterol measurements in the United States, and together they are recognized as the National Reference System for Cholesterol. The NCEP Laboratory Standardization Panel recommends that cholesterol measurements made by all clinical laboratories should be standardized so that cholesterol values are traceable to the National Reference System for Cholesterol. In support of the NCEP's efforts, CDC will establish a standardization program permitting the laboratory and manufacturing community to trace cholesterol measurements and the development of cholesterol diagnostic products back to the national reference system. The major emphasis of this standardization effort is to establish a network of reference method laboratories (1) to assign cholesterol values to all commercially prepared lots of calibrators and control materials and (2) to provide reference measurements on individual \"fresh\" human serum specimens to manufacturers and clinical laboratories. CDC is also working to (1) provide reference materials to manufacturers, (2) collaborate with NBS to maintain documentation of the national reference system accuracy base, (3) cooperate with proficiency testing organizations to assist in the accurate labeling of reference materials, and (4) provide training and education pertinent to cholesterol standardization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The levels of these apoproteins provide information about the plasma concentrations and metabolism of the lipoproteins with which they are associated. The levels of apoprotein B and apoprotein A-I and the Lp(a) lipoprotein can serve as important predictors of coronary heart disease risk and can provide information not available from blood lipid and lipoprotein lipid levels. For clinicians and public health interests, the decision to use apoprotein measurements and to estimate cardiovascular risk depends on the clinical setting, the availability of standardized apoprotein methods that can be related to age- and sex-specific population-based reference values, and the cost of the measurements. In addition, these apoproteins can be used in specific cases to answer diagnostic questions and provide information about therapeutic response.\r"

Their direct role in atherosclerosis is still controversial and their inter-relationships with other lipoproteins make clarity of this issue difficult. Triglyceride measurements, as part of lipid evaluation for atherosclerotic risk, are important as they provide the only convenient and cost-effective method for routinely estimating LDL cholesterol. Their inverse relationship to HDL makes triglyceride measurements a cost-effective screening procedure. Unlike cholesterol measurements, triglycerides should always be assessed in the fasting state. Analytical methods are predominantly based on enzymatic reagent systems that reliably measure the glycerol component after fatty acid hydrolysis. Standardization (that is, accuracy) is still a major problem, while precision appears satisfactory in most clinical laboratories.\r"

Precision or reproducibility of results is not a problem for most of the laboratories, but accuracy is a major concern. Both the manufacturers and laboratorians need to standardize the measurement for cholesterol so that the accuracy base is traceable to the NCCLS NRS/CHOL. The manufacturers need to adopt a uniform policy that will ensure that the values assigned to calibration, quality control, and quality assurance or survey materials are accurate and traceable to the NCCLS/CHOL. Since, at present, there are some limitations of these materials caused by matrix effects, laboratories are encouraged to use the CDC-NHLBI National Reference Laboratory Network to evaluate and monitor their ability to measure patient blood cholesterol levels accurately.

  ".W": "Cirrhosis is a histologic term that requires liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Although we may usefully classify cirrhosis by cause, such as alcoholic cirrhosis, the morphologic diagnosis is confined to only a few descriptive terms. Cirrhosis is the end result of hepatocellular necrosis that initiates the inflammatory process. Hepatocellular necrosis induced by the hepatoviruses is caused by the host response to the parasitized cells rather than by the viruses themselves. Inflammatory cells, apparently by diverse mechanisms that include the immune system, stimulate the deposition of collagen around hepatocytes and in sinusoidal membranes, causing profound alteration in hepatocyte function and hepatic blood flow. Fully developed cirrhosis cannot be reversed with therapy presently available. Efforts to change morbidity and mortality of this common disease include preventive measures, attempts to manipulate the immune response, efforts to influence the biologic process of fibrosis, and, finally, attempts to induce resorption of established collagen. No acceptable therapy to prevent cirrhosis currently exists, but there is reason to believe that one can and will be developed in the future, probably through the discovery of better methods of eliminating the persistent infection by hepatoviruses. The most encouraging results to date come from experiments using prednisone followed by interferon, and from very preliminary results with methotrexate in specific circumstances. In the meantime, the clinician will continue to support the existing physiology, minimize and treat the complications, and offer support to the patient and family.\r"

The possibilities for developing other programs, particularly chest pain, fever, and other global categories, are obvious. We are presently working on a chest pain program and a diagnostic strategy program. Based on the results reported here, we believe that several factors could improve program accuracy. For example, with additional clinical studies and refinement of the program structure, with more expert knowledge, and with further algorithmic development, the program could be made to outperform the average clinician and possibly approach the level of true clinical experts in abdominal pain diagnosis by mimicking their analysis. Indeed, since a program of this type is capable of incorporating the expertise of many different clinicians, it has the potential of outperforming any given expert in specific cases.\r"

The most effective form of ulcer maintenance therapy appears to be continuous low-dose nocturnal therapy with H2-receptor antagonists. Patients who are observed expectantly and develop recurrent ulcer symptoms can be treated with full-strength therapy on an intermittent basis. Patients with a definite seasonal trend to their ulcer disease may benefit from a seasonal approach to therapy. Ulcer surgery is reserved for patients with ulcer complications or severe symptoms unresponsive to standard maintenance therapy. Just how long continuous low-dose maintenance therapy can or should be continued remains unclear. Whether ulcer disease is ever truly cured (never to recur again), as suggested by pre-endoscopic studies, is a matter of conjecture. Nevertheless, the use of maintenance-dose therapy appears to be safe over relatively long periods of time, and it appears that cumulative ulcer relapse rates decline with continued use of such therapy. The risk of recurrent symptoms, hemorrhage, and other complications is also reduced by maintenance therapy, and the economic aspects of ulcer disease are influenced in a positive fashion by these regimens. The role that C. pylori will ultimately play in the etiology and pathogenesis of peptic ulcers and their relapse is still not known with any certainty, although it appears to represent an important marker (if not an important pathogenetic cause) for ulcer disease. As such, it may be considered a risk factor to be eliminated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nutritional care and diet therapy are critical for two reasons. First, malnutrition is an expected sequelae to most, if not all, GI diseases or disorders. Failure to eat, digest, or assimilate nutrients can provoke malnutrition in just a few weeks, although careful assessment of anthropometric, clinical, biochemical, and nutritional history by a trained professional can protect against this. Diet therapy through the elimination of offending foods such as wheat gluten or lactose, or inclusion of specialized products such as medium chain triglycerides or elemental formulas, can sustain nutritional status. Dietary components such as insoluble fiber appear to have physiologic effects, while soluble fibers may have metabolic effects important to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is a high potential for malnutrition in Crohn's disease during active and remittent phases. Elemental enteral formulas or TPN are used during the active phase to ensure optimal nutritional status and bowel rest. Hyperalimentation using the GI tract during remittent stage maintains this. Avoiding offending foods by Crohn's patients is an acceptable practice as long as entire categories of foods are not deleted. Avoiding all foods containing gluten from wheat, rye, barley, and oats, however, is a crucial prerequisite to recovery from celiac disease. Gluten is commonly used as a stabilizer, emulsifier, and extender in the food industry and is not always shown on food labels. Careful consultation with a registered dietitian can identify hidden sources of gluten in the diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean FEV1 of the group improved 17.1 percent after treatment with ipratropium bromide, 12.5 percent after metaproterenol treatment, and 16.6 percent after treatment with both of these medications together. There was no significant difference between these responses and patients who responded to one treatment tended to respond to the others. The side effects with these medications were minimal. When compared with patients in previous studies, our patients, who were much older as a group, demonstrated a greater degree of bronchodilation with ipratropium bromide and metaproterenol, as well as a greater degree of bronchoconstriction with placebo.\r"

  ".W": "We have developed a new continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device that consists of a microcomputer, a pressure transducer, and a pair of electronic interface valves. One of these valves creates the inspiratory demand flow, and the other creates the opposing jet flow by acting as an expiratory valve to maintain a constant CPAP. By controlling the two electronic interface valves, the airway pressure can be kept constant during the entire respiratory cycle. We compared our device with CPAP systems supplied with commercially available ventilators: the Puritan-Bennett 7200a, the Bear 5, the Servo 900C, and the CV 2000. A two-chambered spring loaded model lung was used to simulate inspiration and a piston pump model lung to simulate active exhalation. We compared both the inspiratory triggering work (WWIt) and expiratory flow-resistive work (WE) of each ventilator while in CPAP mode by calculating the corresponding areas of the pressure-volume loops using electrical integration. The WWIt of our apparatus and demand-flow ventilators was much smaller than that of the CV 2000. In our device, WE was also much smaller than those of the others. These results indicate that our device can be used for CPAP without causing airway pressure fluctuation, and therefore, without imposing an extra workload on the patient.\r"

  ".W": "Although a wide variety of disease processes can result in a failure of renal excretory function, the vast majority of cases with \"acute renal failure\" (ARF) are due to the syndrome of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The syndrome is usually initiated by an acute injury to the proximal renal tubular epithelial cells by ischemic or nephrotoxic events. This is followed by progressive and often rapid increases in the concentration of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine. In the average case, the failure of renal excretory function persists for 1 to 3 weeks, to be followed by recovery. Oliguria (urine volume less than 400 ml) is present in about half of the patients. The pathogenesis of the retention of nitrogenous waste in human ATN is the subject of controversy, but the balance of data in most patients suggests that the predominant mechanism is a profound secondary vasoconstriction in response to tubular cell injury. This may represent a teleologically appropriate response to prevent catastrophic losses of fluid that would occur, if the normally high rates of glomerular filtration continued, in the face of reduced tubular reabsorptive capacity. The mechanisms by which the tubular cell injury is communicated to the vasculature, and the mediators of the hemodynamic changes, remain to be established. The differential diagnosis in a patient with ARF, usually involves exclusion of an obstruction to the urinary tract as an initial step. The next step is to differentiate the patients with ATN from those who have renal hypoperfusion in response to events in the systemic circulation, but who otherwise have functionally and structurally intact kidneys, i.e., prerenal ARF. The kidneys of patients with prerenal ARF exhibit the normal renal response to an acute reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This consists of avid reabsorption of the filtered salt and H2O, so that a small amount of concentrated and NaCl-poor urine is elaborated. The tubular cell injury in ATN syndromes prevents this response from maximally occurring, so that the urine is isosmotic and relatively rich in NaCl.\r"

  ".U": "89170484\r", 
  ".W": "Pubertal development in mammals is in part attributable to a brain-dependent process, whereby increased pulsatile GnRH secretion leads to the awakening of the entire reproductive system. However, the brain mechanisms controlling this event are unknown. The apparent increase in GnRH secretion at puberty could reflect an autonomous change in the activity of GnRH neurons themselves or in the afferent networks leading to GnRH neurons. If there were a significant increase in the secretion of GnRH with puberty onset, we hypothesized that there would be a commensurate increase in the biosynthetic capacity of GnRH neurons to meet the increasing demand. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the level of cellular prepro-GnRH mRNA (GnRH mRNA) observed between prepubertal (25-day-old; n = 5) and adult (75-day-old; n = 4) male rats by in situ hybridization. We detected no significant change with puberty in GnRH mRNA signal levels in any of the anatomical areas examined, which included the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, medial septum, lateral preoptic area, and medial preoptic area. Given the variance of our analytical technique, we determined that there was a greater than 90% probability that we would have detected a 20% increase in GnRH mRNA had there been one. Endogenous opioid peptides have been implicated in timing the onset of puberty in the rat, with the argument being that a loss in opioid tone could effect a disinhibition of GnRH secretion. One opioid peptide, beta-endorphin, is among several peptides cleaved from the precursor POMC. We hypothesized that with puberty, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus would have an attenuated capacity to produce beta-endorphin. We tested this hypothesis by comparing cellular pre-POMC mRNA (POMC mRNA) levels in the arcuate nuclei of prepubertal (n = 6) and adult (n = 7) male rats with in situ hybridization. We observed an increase in POMC mRNA levels with puberty; prepubertal rats had relative POMC mRNA signal levels of 119 +/- 10 grains/cell, while adult rats contained 167 +/- 12 grains/cell (P less than 0.02). This increase in cellular POMC mRNA was confined to the rostral portion of the arcuate nucleus. We conclude that the GnRH gene is fully expressed well before the time of normal puberty onset and that the increase in POMC mRNA that occurs with the onset of puberty may be important for the development of pulsatile GnRH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, it has been demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-(7-37) possesses a potent insulinotropic activity. In this paper, we compared the effects of GLP-1-(1-37) and -(7-37) and glucagon on insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin release from isolated perfused canine and rat pancreases under the perfusate condition of 5.5 mM glucose plus arginine. With canine pancreas perfusion, 1 nM GLP-1-(7-37) was more potent in stimulating insulin and somatostatin release than was the same dose of glucagon [stimulation to 375 +/- 36% vs. 302 +/- 28% of the basal level for insulin (P less than 0.05); 724 +/- 129% vs. 311 +/- 33% of the basal level for somatostatin (P less than 0.01)]. GLP-1-(1-37) (1 nM) did not stimulate either insulin or somatostatin release. GLP-1-(7-37) (1 nM) decreased the glucagon level of the effluent perfusate to 67.2 +/- 3.4% of its basal level; but 1 nM GLP-1-(1-37) did not. Glucagon (1 nM) decreased GLP-1-like immunoreactivity to 64.0 +/- 5.2% of its basal level. With rat pancreatic perfusion, the minimal dose for stimulation of insulin release was 100 nM for GLP-1-(1-37), 0.1 nM for GLP-1-(7-37), and 1 nM for glucagon, respectively. Glucagon release was partially inhibited by 100 nM GLP-1-(1-37) and 1 and 10 nM GLP-1-(7-37). The present results indicate that 1) since GLP-1-(7-37) is released from the intestine, it might be an important incretin candidate along with gastric inhibitory peptide; and 2) the release of proglucagon-derived peptides from pancreatic A-cells is regulated by autofeedback through glucagon and GLP-1.\r"

Autoradiographic analysis of the binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ala8]AII to slide-mounted frozen sections of 17-day-old DBA/2N mice revealed abundant AII receptors widely distributed throughout the body. High receptor density was found in primitive mesenchymal tissue under the epidermis and surrounding muscle and cartilage, in skeletal and smooth muscle, and in all layers of the adrenal cortex. Lower receptor density was seen in the kidney, liver, and lungs. The autoradiographic staining was abolished by incubation of the sections with excess unlabeled AII. Scatchard analysis of the binding of 125I-[Sar1,Ala8,]AII to membrane-rich fractions of eviscerated fetuses showed a single type of high affinity receptors with a Kd of 2.9 x 10(-9) M and a receptor concentration of 3300 fmol/mg protein. Localization of renin mRNA was analyzed by in situ hybridization using an antisense 35S-labeled riboprobe transcribed from a mouse renin2 cDNA clone. Hybridization to fetal tissue sections showed high intensity staining in the kidney and adrenal cortex. Northern blot analysis confirmed the high expression of renin mRNA in the fetal kidney. The presence of an active renin-angiotensin system in the fetus was confirmed by the demonstration of renin-like activity and bioactive AII in fetal extracts. The widespread distribution of AII receptors in the fetus, compared to the discrete localization to specialized tissues in the adult, may indicate a unique role for the peptide during development.\r"

The intact islets prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mM LiCl and 1 mM myoinositol. Glucose, alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC), and sulfated cholecystokinin (CCK8S) increased insulin secretion and formation of [3H]inositol phosphate, [3H]inositol bisphosphate, and [3H] inositol trisphosphate. Mannoheptulose, a glucokinase inhibitor, inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion and [3H]inositol phosphate formation; however, it did not inhibit KIC- and CCK8S-induced secretion and formation. Both glucose- and KIC-induced insulin secretion and [3H]inositol phosphate formation were blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. The islets prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol were permeabilized by digitonin and then incubated in intracellular mimicking medium containing 1 microM Ca2+ and 2.5 mM ATP. Glucose had no effect on [3H]inositol phosphate formation in the permeabilized islets, and CCK8S increased the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates. Thus, phospholipase-C in pancreatic islets is activated not only via ligand-receptor interaction in the plasma membrane in the case of hormone stimulation, but also by metabolic product(s) in the case of fuel stimulation.\r"

Formula cort concentrations in the range found in milk (0.1-0.5 micrograms/ml) increased the survival of adx rats, but did not induce intestinal differentiation. Formulae containing 1.0-50.0 micrograms/ml cort caused a dose-dependent elevation of serum cort concentrations and jejunal maltase activity and precocious jejunal sucrase induction. Adx rats receiving the formula containing 10 micrograms/ml cort showed serum cort concentrations similar to those in day 15 control rats and jejunal sucrase and maltase activities equivalent to those in day 18-20 control rats, suggesting that the rise in serum cort that occurs during postnatal development suffices to modulate intestinal differentiation. To distinguish between direct local and systemic effects of luminal cort on intestinal differentiation, expression of sucrase was determined in jejunal isografts and in host jejunum from adx rats fed luminal cort. Jejunal isografts and host jejunum expressed similar sucrase activities and showed similar immunofluorescent staining. Moreover, administration of cort by continual ip infusion was more effective than continual intragastric infusion in inducing intestinal sucrase and maltase activities. These data imply that luminal cort is absorbed and transported into the systemic circulation before inducing intestinal epithelial cell differentiation through the systemic route.\r"

  ".U": "89170504\r", 
  ".W": "The suppression during lactation of pulsatile LH release and pituitary GnRH receptors has been attributed to a primary deficit in hypothalamic GnRH release. In the present investigation we have attempted to characterize the responsiveness of the lactational hypothalamus using the excitatory amino acid receptor agonist N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMA) to stimulate LH and PRL secretion. Lactating rats were ovariectomized on day 2 postpartum, and their litters were adjusted to eight pups. Dual venous catheters were implanted 6-7 days later, and rats were fitted with protective tethers and jackets for chronic pulsatile infusions of GnRH and NMA. GnRH pulses (5 or 10 ng/pulse once every 50 min) were administered for 20 h to up-regulate GnRH receptors and restore pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Rats were then infused with NMA (40 mg/kg BW.pulse) once every 50 min for four pulses or once every 2 h over a 24-h period. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals at times surrounding the final two GnRH pulses, the first several NMA pulses, and the final three NMA pulses 24 h later. Samples were analyzed for LH and PRL by RIA. Procedural control experiments were performed in normal adult rats with NMA administered at 20 mg/kg BW.pulse in males and at 20 and 40 mg/kg BW.pulse in females. Whereas normal rats responded to NMA pulses with unambiguous LH and PRL peaks, lactating rats failed to show LH responses either acutely or after 24 h of treatment. PRL responses to the drug depended upon the circulating levels of the hormone immediately preceding each NMA pulse. When levels were elevated (presumably due to intermittent suckling by the pups), NMA infusion resulted in an acute suppression of PRL. When PRL levels were low, NMA appeared to neither stimulate nor inhibit this hormone. These data suggest that GnRH release from the hypothalamus of the lactating rat is refractory to NMA stimulation, perhaps due to suckling-induced activation of endogenous opioid peptide or gamma-aminobutyric acid systems that could suppress GnRH neurons. Conversion of the PRL response from stimulation by NMA in normal animals to inhibition during lactation might be attributed to simultaneous activation of both dopamine neurons and the PRL-releasing factor system. According to this hypothesis, the response to NMA would be dominated by PRL-releasing factor in normal rats and by dopamine in lactating animals, which have a lower dopamine turnover rate and thus a greater potential for becoming activated by NMA.\r"

The resting [Ca2+]i concentration was 96.7 +/- 2.9 nM (n = 115). The majority of the granulosa cells responded to LHRH at doses between 10(-7) and 10(-5) M; the latter dose was the highest concentration required to initiate alterations in [Ca2+]i in these cells. The alterations in [Ca2+]i induced by LHRH were transient and returned to resting levels within 84 +/- 3 sec (n = 64). A potent LHRH antagonist completely blocked the effect of LHRH on [Ca2+]i. Within a single granulosa cell, three consecutive injections of the same dose of LHRH, delivered 5 min apart, induced three discrete peaks of [Ca2+]i of similar amplitudes. Sustained perfusions of LHRH, however, resulted in a desensitization of the [Ca2+]i response to LHRH, but not to the calcium ionophore Br-A23187. These results, which were obtained from individual cells, provide strong support for the hypothesis that acute changes in [Ca2+]i are involved in the early cellular transduction of the LHRH signal in the ovary.\r"

Binding of [3H]estradiol was found to be optimal at pH 7.4 in the presence of 0.3 M KCl and was linearly related to protein concentration. Binding was very rapid, reaching maximal levels in about 30 min, and was reversible with a dissociation rate constant of 13.2 +/- 1.7 x 10(-4) sec-1. EBP binding was destroyed by treatment with proteolytic enzymes and by high temperatures. Scatchard analysis of the [3H]estradiol equilibrium binding data of C. albicans (strain stn-1) yielded an apparent dissociation constant of 12.3 +/- 2.1 nM and a maximal binding capacity of 753 +/- 145 fmol/mg protein. Binding competition experiments showed very high specificity and stereoselectivity of EBP, demonstrating the following order of potency in displacing [3H]estradiol: 17 beta-estradiol greater than estrone greater than estriol greater than 17 alpha-estradiol. Negligible competitive potency was found for other mammalian steroid hormones, diethylstilbestrol, tamoxifen, or fungal hormones. The abundance of EBP was 4- to 10-fold higher during the early logarithmic growth phase of yeast cells than during the stationary phase. The molecular size of EBP, measured by Sephacryl S-200 gel exclusion chromatography, yielded a Stokes radius of approximately 29 A. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation showed a sedimentation coefficient (S2020,W) of 4, with no ionic dependent aggregation of the [3H]estradiol-EBP complex. The apparent mol wt of the EBP is approximately 46,000, with an axial ratio of 1, indicating the symmetrical shape of the molecule. In summary, in addition to the previously described corticosterone-binding protein, a separate high affinity, stereospecific, estrogen-selective binder has been demonstrated in the cytosol of C. albicans.\r"

  ".W": "The acute regulatory effects of glucose on proinsulin synthesis at the translational level and the subsequent processing of newly made hormone through the insulin biosynthetic-secretory pathway in a clonal cell line (HIT-T15 cells) of simian virus 40-transformed hamster pancreatic islet beta-cells were examined. Proinsulin synthesis in HIT-T15 cells, assayed by immunoprecipitation, comprised 2.5-5% of the total protein synthesis during a 40-min pulse label period, though preproinsulin mRNA levels were only 0.25-0.29% of the total mRNA. There was no specific enhancement of proinsulin synthesis in response to increasing concentrations of glucose or other tested metabolites or by agents stimulating the cAMP or protein kinase-C second messenger systems during a 40-min pulse label period. Compared to that in normal beta-cells, processing of proinsulin to insulin was markedly retarded. Unlike that in normal beta-cells, newly synthesized hormone in HIT cells was secreted at a very low rate that was not enhanced by a high glucose concentration and was not preferentially secreted compared with preformed hormone. Thus, although a glucose sensor was present in HIT cells, since secretion of preformed insulin stores was stimulated 8-fold between glucose concentrations of 0 and 11 mM, regulation at several stages in the passage of newly made insulin through the biosynthetic-secretory pathway did not display the acute glucose sensitivity seen in normal nontransformed beta-cells.\r"

We attempted to correlate this finding with an endocrine response to relaxin in rats. Anterior pituitary cells were enzymatically dispersed and subjected to the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. PRL secretion was significantly stimulated 1.31-fold by human relaxin at the lowest concentration studied (30 pM) and maximally stimulated 1.65-fold at 0.3 nM relaxin. Antibodies directed against relaxin inhibited this effect, as did the PRL inhibitory hormone, dopamine. In contrast to the response of PRL cells, there was no effect or a slight inhibition of LH release after incubation with relaxin. In conclusion, we propose that one of the pituitary cell types responsive to relaxin in culture is the PRL-secreting mammotroph.\r"

Dosages of PHT and CBZ were adjusted to maintain serum concentrations +/- 20 and +/- 25% of baseline values. All patients required a PHT dosage decrease of 10-30% during active FBM treatment to maintain stable concentrations. CBZ serum concentrations decreased significantly in patients receiving active FBM. The mean decrease was 1.3 micrograms/ml and occurred in 30 of 32 patients. Therefore, FBM apparently causes a bidirectional effect on the serum concentrations of PHT and CBZ when all three drugs are taken concomitantly.\r"

  ".W": "The management of ectopic gestation has become more challenging than ever before. The recent progress in diagnostic modalities, i.e., ultrasound and sensitive beta-hCG assays, has enabled early detection of ectopic gestation and a change in treatment goals. The traditional catastrophic presentation of a ruptured ectopic gestation and hemoperitoneum no longer is common. Today this condition is typically diagnosed before a rupture occurs, while the patient is only minimally symptomatic. Accordingly, treatment has shifted from an immediate life-saving intervention, into conservative methods of management, directed at preserving fertility and reducing morbidity. As experience is being gained rapidly in the various conservative treatment methods, their respective merits can be evaluated. Laparoscopic linear salpingostomy is the treatment of choice for small, unruptured, isthmic or ampullary gestations. Laparoscopic segmental resection is most suitable for ruptured tubal gestations. These procedures should be performed via laparotomy only if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. In selected cases, nonsurgical treatment methods, i.e., expectant management or methotrexate, may be considered. Serial serum beta-hCG measurements following a conservative treatment is mandatory to rule out persistence of trophoblastic tissue. Further prospective randomized studies are needed, to compare different conservative treatment methods in regard to their respective safety, reproductive outcome, and economic feasibility.\r"

Human theca cell cultures were established and were found to produce both prorenin as well as active renin. Androstenedione levels (126 +/- 28 pg/500,000 cells/24-hr incubation) correlated with prorenin levels (8.5 +/- 1.1 ng angiotensin I per milliliter per hour (AI/ml/hr) in culture supernatant (r = 0.61, P less than 0.05). Active renin levels in follicular fluid were higher in stimulated versus spontaneous cycles (359 +/- 67 versus 126 +/- 37 ng AI/ml/hr, P less than 0.05). Renin substrate levels were similar in follicular fluid and in the peripheral serum (1,610 +/- 216 versus 2,160 +/- 490 ng/ml) in spontaneous cycles. Follicular fluid prorenin and active renin did not correlate with oocyte maturity or with steroid levels. The authors conclude that ovarian theca cells produce renin in vitro. However, renin production does not correlate with oocyte maturity or follicular fluid steroids in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Catecholamines released from the sympathochromaffin system produce metabolic changes similar to those of diabetes mellitus. However, increased sympathochromaffin activity does not appear to be a feature of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), although physiologic catecholamine increments may contribute to short-term metabolic derangements under some conditions. Increased glycemic sensitivity to epinephrine is a feature of IDDM but is the result of the inability to secrete insulin rather than of increased cellular sensitivity to catecholamines. Absolute insulin deficiency results in increased metabolic (glycemic, lipolytic, and ketogenic) sensitivity to catecholamines. More generalized hypersensitivity occurs in diabetic autonomic neuropathy. However, the clinical relevance of these alterations in sensitivity remains to be established. On the other hand, decreased sympathochromaffin activity is common and causes considerable morbidity and some mortality in people with diabetes. In addition to increased sensitivity to catecholamines, decreased sympathochromaffin activity results in the clinical syndromes of postural hypotension, hypoglycemia unawareness, defective glucose counterregulation, or a combination of these. The latter two syndromes cause an increased frequency of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia, at least during intensive therapy of IDDM. Thus, decreased rather than increased sympathochromaffin activity often complicates IDDM. Clearly, ways to prevent, correct, or compensate for this component of diabetic autonomic neuropathy must be learned before diabetes can be managed effectively and safely in all patients who suffer from the disease until diabetes mellitus is eradicated.\r"

Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that erythrocytes absorbed and incorporated glucose into their glycogen stores when glucose concentration in the medium was high and liberated it when the concentration was low. Epinephrine administration inhibited glucose absorption by erythrocytes, and in its presence, erythrocytes liberated glucose from their glycogen stores, being unable to compensate for this rise in glucose concentration in plasma. Similar results were obtained when endogenous secretion of epinephrine was enhanced by carotid sinus-chemoreceptor stimulation. Insulin had no effect on the capacity of erythrocytes to absorb glucose. These data suggest a role for erythrocytes in the transport of glucose to different regions in the organism's circulation and in the regulation of glucose concentration in plasma.\r"

  ".U": "89171626\r", 
  ".W": "It is accepted for insulin-secreting cells in culture that the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels causes the glucose-dependent depolarization of pancreatic beta-cells seen at subthreshold levels (less than 100 mg/dl) of glucose. The question remains for the more thoroughly studied beta-cells in freshly dissected intact islets, however, whether closure of these channels is responsible for subthreshold glucose-dependent depolarization and suprathreshold glucose-dependent regulation of membrane electrical activity. To answer this, we took advantage of the ability of tolbutamide, an orally active antidiabetic agent, to specifically inhibit ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta-cells to determine whether these channels are active at sub- and suprathreshold levels of glucose and whether channel closure by tolbutamide reproduces the electrophysiological effects of glucose stimulation. We recorded membrane electrical activity from freshly dissected adult mouse pancreatic islets exposed to various levels of glucose and tolbutamide. As previously found by others, tolbutamide depolarizes islet cells in the absence of glucose, but we have found that, although the depolarization can trigger Ca2+ action potentials (spikes), a glucose-dependent permissive factor may be required for the normal bursting pattern of spiking. More significantly, we found that, unlike other beta-cell stimuli, tolbutamide specifically mimics the effects of glucose stimulation on the pattern of suprathreshold electrical activity. The effects were seen with levels of tolbutamide that correspond to those required to inhibit ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These data suggest that ATP-sensitive K+ channels are active at sub- and suprathreshold levels of glucose and may be the sole pathway by which either glucose or tolbutamide depolarizes beta-cells and controls beta-cell electrical activity.\r"

  ".W": "In patch-clamped surface cells of human islets, we identified an inwardly rectifying, voltage-independent K+ channel that may be a crucial link between substrate metabolism and depolarization-induced insulin secretion. It is the major channel open at rest. It closes on exposure of the cell to secretagogue concentrations of glucose or other metabolic fuels and oral hypoglycemic sulfonylureas but reopens on addition of either a metabolic inhibitor that prevents substrate utilization or the hyperglycemic sulfonamide diazoxide. Onset of electrical activity coincides with channel closure by the secretagogues. In excised patches, the activity of this channel is inhibited at its cytoplasmic surface by ATP. These results suggest that in humans, as in rodents, 1) rises in cytoplasmic ATP levels during substrate metabolism trigger K+-channel closure and cell depolarization and 2) clinically useful sulfonamides modulate glucose-induced insulin secretion, in part by affecting a readily identifiable resting conductance pathway for K+.\r"

Virtually all NOD/WEHI mice develop insulitis, but very few progress to diabetes. However, cyclophosphamide (CY) can promote the onset of diabetes in NOD mice, including the NOD/WEHI strain. The means by which CY produces diabetes was investigated in NOD/WEHI mice, in which it was hypothesized that active suppression mechanisms prevented the progression from insulitis to diabetes. A study of the time course of insulitis in the islets after CY was given showed that insulitis was initially reduced but rapidly increased over 16 days, and T-lymphocytes were predominant in the lesion. This suggested a compression of the normal time course of the disease seen in NOD mice. CY did not produce diabetes in any of 11 non-NOD strains studied. Fetal isografts in NOD mice given CY several days before were subjected to lymphocytic infiltration and beta-cell destruction. These findings suggested that CY was not directly beta-cell toxic and that altered beta-cells were not essential for beta-cell destruction. This was further demonstrated with subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin, which significantly damaged beta-cells but did not increase the severity of insulitis or induce diabetes as did CY. Most important, the transfer of mononuclear cells from nondiabetic NOD mice to mice given CY prevented diabetes, which indicated that the likely effect of CY was via immunomodulation, possibly by allowing poised effector cells to act on beta-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations were maintained constant by infusion of somatostatin with insulin and glucagon replacements. Infusion of NE for 170 min resulted in an increase in total ketone body production ([3-14C]acetoacetate infusions) to 8.5 +/- 1.3 vs. 3.9 +/- 0.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1 (P less than .01) in saline controls and in an increase in plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) to 1120 +/- 102 vs. 526 +/- 115 microM (P less than .01) in controls. alpha-Blockade during NE infusion enhanced the lipolytic effect of NE, because plasma FFA increased to 1981 +/- 204 vs. 1301 +/- 146 microM after 45 min (P less than .002), and the ketogenic effect was augmented (14.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.9 mumol.kg-1.min-1) after 60 min (P less than .001). In contrast, beta-blockade abolished the ketogenic and lipolytic effects of NE to those observed in saline controls.
