The majority of patients (81%) preferred computer assessment. There were no differences in attitude or difficulties between diagnostic groups. Older patients had more difficulties and took longer than younger patients. The computer system was also more efficient than the form from an information handling and administrative point of view.\r"

An alternative route via the canine fossa provided easier access, better patient tolerance and improved visualization of the antral contents. It was associated with a lower incidence of immediate complications, although there were a number of delayed symptoms, all of which were mild and transient. The canine fossa approach under local anaesthesia offers an effective and more acceptable alternative for antroscopy as an out-patient procedure.\r"

This study of 22 patients undergoing SMD, confirms that the pre-operative decongestion produced by xylometazoline is both a good subjective (P less than 0.001) and objective (P less than 0.002) predictor of outcome. If a significant reduction in nasal resistance is achieved by the application of topical decongestants, then the operation of SMD is likely to be effective.\r"

The sum of these 2 distances is in accordance with the distance between the vocal fold level and the lower border of the cricoid arch given in the literature. This implies that the high pressure zone of the upper oesophageal sphincter corresponds to the pars fundiformis of the cricopharyngeus muscle. The lower part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and the upper circular muscle fibres of the oesophagus contribute to the sphincter. When the bolus approached the sphincter, the pressure decreased and during bolus passage the pressure was below or well below half of the resting pressure. The pressure profile disclosed no signs of muscular dyscoordination or discontinuity of the upper oesophageal sphincter.\r"

Small intracranial tumour extensions were more readily detected by MRI than CT.

PGA is present in large amounts while PGC is almost absent in the urine of healthy subjects. Whether the amount of PGA in the urine represents the total amount of PGA that is extracted, is unknown. We, therefore, assessed the renal metabolism of PGA and PGC by measuring PGA, PGC and creatinine concentrations in the aorta and the right renal vein, and in the urine from patients undergoing elective heart catheterization. The renal extractions of PGA and PGC were not significantly different from the extraction of creatinine: 22%, 18% and 24%, respectively. Sixty-eight percent of PGA and 98% of PGC extracted from the circulation were metabolized by the kidney, and fractional metabolism was closely related to the fractional reabsorption of PGA and PGC from the glomerular filtrate. It is concluded that the kidney metabolizes PGA and PGC. The fractional metabolism of PGA and PGC can be calculated from the fractional reabsorption. Further studies on the renal handling of pepsinogens are warranted as they may provide information on factors affecting renal metabolism of low molecular weight proteins.\r"

The effect on absolute reticulocyte count, hemoglobin and serum ferritin was studied during a twenty-week period. Red-cell volume and red-cell life span were measured with 51Cr-tagged erythrocytes at baseline and after twenty weeks of r-huEPO. Absolute reticulocyte counts and hemoglobin concentration rose markedly (from 55.6 +/- 31.2 to a maximum of 174.9 +/- 31.0 x 10(9)/l at 4 weeks and from 6.8 +/- 0.3 to a maximum of 11.2 +/- 1.3 g/dl at 12 weeks, respectively, p less than 0.001) without any further need for transfusions. Red-cell volumes increased concomitantly (from 58 +/- 4 to 81 +/- 11% of normal, p less than 0.005), in spite of a persistent shortening of red-cell life span (45 +/- 18 and 47 +/- 4 days before and after r-huEPO). Markedly elevated serum ferritin concentrations indicating iron overload decreased slowly from 3,550 +/- 1,615 to 2,721 +/- 1,506 micrograms/l (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that r-huEPO is very effective in treating the anemia of patients maintained on hemodialysis. The favorable effects on hemoglobin and red-cell volumes occur in spite of persistent hemolysis and lead to a slow reduction of iron overload.\r"

Interstitial fibrosis is considered to develop possibly as a consequence of unresorbed interstitial edema which can develop during an episode of acute renal failure. Coexisting T-cell-mediated disease in the region of the intertubular capillaries is also considered as a possible factor in the development of interstitial fibrosis.\r"

There were higher hematocrits in males and diabetics, lower serum creatinine levels in females, diabetics and older patients, and lower blood urea nitrogen levels in blacks. The time interval from diagnosis of diabetes mellitus to initiation of dialysis in patients with diabetic nephropathy due to juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus (20.6 +/- 6.8 years) was twice that in adult onset diabetes mellitus (10.3 +/- 8.3 years).\r"

Specific activities of I-125-VLDL apoB (apolipoprotein B) and I-125-IDLapoB (intermediate density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B) were measured for forty-eight hours. Synthesis rates (flux) and fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) of VLDLapoB and IDLapoB for hyperlipidemic (n = 8), normolipidemic (n = 4) dialysis patients and controls (n = 4) were calculated. Dialysis patients had lower VLDLapoB FCRs than controls (p less than 0.05); hyperlipidemic dialysis patients had marginally raised VLDLapoB flux over normolipidemics (p = 0.0508), suggesting apoB production might play a greater role in the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemics had lower IDLapoB FCRs than controls (p = 0.01). IDLapoB flux was similar in all three groups. The discrepancy in VLDLapoB fluxes between hyperlipidemics and normolipidemics with similar IDLapoB fluxes suggested that VLDLapoB could be directly catabolized in hyperlipidemics. ApoB concentration was increased in VLDL, IDL of hyperlipidemics when compared with normolipidemics (p less than 0.05) and controls (p = 0.01). Hyperlipidemic VLDL plasma levels were relatively enriched with cholesterol when compared with controls, p less than 0.01, and normolipidemics, p less than 0.05. These factors might all contribute towards accelerated atherogenesis in hyperlipidemic dialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "The ultrastructural alterations of glomerular anionic sites were studied in biopsy specimens from 34 patients with IgA nephropathy using polyethyleneimine (PEI). Prominent common findings in the glomeruli of the patients were few PEI particles in electron dense deposits in the mesangial and subepithelial area and marked reduction in glomerular anionic sites covered with deposits. The anionic sites of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and epithelial cell surface coat (ESC) appeared unaltered in the patients with hematuria and/or mild proteinuria. But in patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range, focally discrete loss of anionic sites in the lamina rara externa (LRE) was seen and the number of anionic sites of the ESC were decreased with retraction of the foot processes. The anionic sites of the lamina rara interna showed much less change in these patients. Subepithelial deposits were often seen concomitantly with focal loss of anionic sites in the LRE at the site of the deposits, but subendothelial deposits had little influence on the anionic sites of the neighboring GBM. The anionic sites of GBM that showed focal thinning with small GBM projections were appreciably decreased in number, but those in split GBM were not decreased. These results suggest that either loss of the negative charge on the glomerular capillary wall associated with subepithelial immune deposition or morphological changes of the GBM contribute to the progression of proteinuria in IgA nephropathy.\r"

  ".W": "We report a 3-month-old infant who became paraplegic from an epidural hematoma caused by a diagnostic lumbar puncture for work-up of sepsis. The differential diagnosis of the cause of paraplegia was epidural hematoma formation versus spinal abscess. Hemophilia A was diagnosed when coagulation studies were discovered to be abnormal, and non-contrast CT scan revealed an epidural mass with spinal cord displacement. The coagulopathy was rapidly corrected preoperatively with an infusion of cryoprecipitate. A medially limited bilateral T8-L4 laminectomy allowed complete evacuation of the hematoma with maximum preservation of normal bone tissue, but no clinical improvement resulted. Coagulopathy should be highly suspect in an infant who becomes paraplegic after lumbar puncture. The coagulopathy may be rapidly corrected with deficient factor replacement, allowing major spinal surgery to be performed safely.\r"

A 250 mg tablet of levodopa was taken with and without a 325 mg tablet of ferrous sulfate by eight normal subjects in a randomized crossover trial. When levodopa was taken with ferrous sulfate there was a 55% decrease in peak levodopa levels (3.6 +/- 2.6 vs 1.6 +/- 0.82 nmol/ml; p less than 0.05) and a 51% decrease in AUC (257 +/- 133 vs 125 +/- 51 nmol.min/ml; p less than 0.01). Persons with the highest peak levodopa levels and AUC after levodopa alone had the greatest reduction in peak levodopa levels and AUC after levodopa ingestion with ferrous sulfate. Iron in its ferrous state is oxidized rapidly to the ferric state in the presence of levodopa at pHs found in the small intestine. In the ferric state, iron binds very strongly to levodopa. Chelation of iron by levodopa is the likely mechanism for this drug interaction. The clinical significance of this interaction is yet to be established.\r"

A randomized crossover study design was used to compare \"standard\" dosing (125 mg/m2/day) to adaptive control, with dose adjustment at 28 hours based on the 24-hour plasma level. A total of 31 patients received 86 cycles of chemotherapy, 36 by standard dosing and 50 by adaptive control. However, there was no demonstrable advantage to the adaptive control scheme, because of apparent bias of the previous model. A new model was proposed that also included serum albumin, performance status, and prior RBC transfusions as measures of interpatient pharmacodynamic variability. We conclude that adaptive control dosing of etoposide is feasible but that the therapy must be individualized for both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability.\r"

Quinolones altered the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, with a significant increase in the AUCs and a decrease in plasma clearance. The elimination half-life increased significantly with pipemidic acid. The apparent volume of distribution, mean renal clearance, and time to reach maximum caffeine concentrations remained unaltered. There was a decline in caffeine metabolite levels in the 24-hour urine samples for both quinolone treatments, suggesting that pipemidic acid and, to a lesser degree, norfloxacin inhibit metabolism of the N-demethylation pathways of caffeine. The practical consequence of this observation could be caffeine accumulation during repeated intake of coffee. In two additional healthy volunteers under a controlled multiple-dose regimen of caffeine ingestion, administration of pipemidic acid for 2 days caused a fourfold increase in the plasma concentrations of caffeine.\r"

A phenylpropanolamine or placebo infusion was administered over 45 minutes on separate days according to a double-blind, balanced protocol. Blood pressure increased by 24 +/- 13/16 +/- 7 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic, mean +/- SD) after the phenylpropanolamine infusion and was statistically different from the placebo infusion response (7 +/- 5/8 +/- 3 mm Hg). Phenylpropanolamine infusions were terminated early in two subjects (hyperresponders) after 0.31 and 0.23 mg/kg because of excessive increases in blood pressure (52/30 and 34/21 mm Hg, respectively). The hyperresponders had the lowest peak serum phenylpropanolamine concentrations. These data suggest that considerable intersubject variability exists in the blood pressure response to intravenous phenylpropanolamine. A pharmacokinetic basis for the variability in response to racemic phenylpropanolamine was not observed. A relationship did not exist within the group between blood pressure effect and serum concentration but did exist within each subject. Therefore phenylpropanolamine's blood pressure effect in an individual cannot be predicted solely from a serum concentration of racemic drug.\r"

After withdrawal of phenelzine, pressor sensitivity to oral tyramine returned to control values within 2 and for more than 8 weeks. Relative bioavailability of conjugated tyramine was elevated sixfold by brofaromine and 11.6-fold by phenelzine. Urinary elimination of tryptamine increased during phenelzine and brofaromine to 12.7-fold and threefold, respectively. 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid (VMA) excretion decreased during brofaromine significantly by 72% and 49%, respectively. The nonsignificant decrease of MHPG excretion and the increase of intravenous tyramine pressor sensitivity caused by phenelzine are significantly related.

Drugs were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates and forearm blood flow was measured by venous plethysmography. Nicardipine (1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min) relaxed forearm arterioles and antagonized the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, whereas verapamil (1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min) was ineffective, although vasodilating to a comparable extent. Therefore, functional alpha-antagonism may contribute to the vasodilating and, possibly, the antihypertensive effect of nicardipine but, apparently, not verapamil. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium channel entry blockers even in human beings.\r"

After hydrochlorothiazide, plasma glucose, uric acid, and renin activity increased and plasma potassium levels decreased. Edema and flushing were the main adverse reactions during nitrendipine. The response of blood pressure and heart rate to head-up tilt were not significantly different under both treatments. However, the effects of both drugs on diastolic blood pressure and norepinephrine responses to head-up tilt differed significantly. We conclude that, in the elderly, hydrochlorothiazide lowers systolic blood pressure more effectively than nitrendipine. However, nitrendipine does not have any of the potentially harmful metabolic side effects that were found during hydrochlorothiazide therapy. The clinical significance of a lower vasoreactivity during nitrendipine, as was found with the head-up tilt test, has to be established.\r"

In addition, the impact of hemodialysis and CAPD on removal of esmolol and ASL-8123 was determined. Multiple blood, urine, and dialysate samples were collected during a 72-hour period and assayed for esmolol and ASL-8123 by HPLC. The pharmacokinetic disposition of esmolol was not significantly altered by renal failure. Mean (+/- SD) total body clearance for esmolol was 171.4 +/- 69.8, 249.8 +/- 176.3, and 265.3 +/- 143.1 ml/min/kg for the control, hemodialysis, and CAPD patients, respectively. Mean elimination half-life (t1/2) was 7.2 minutes in control subjects compared with 7.1 and 8.0 minutes for the hemodialysis and CAPD groups, respectively. The apparent volume of distribution of esmolol did not differ significantly among the three groups. ASL-8123 was shown to accumulate in patients with renal failure, as evidenced by a mean maximum blood concentration of 42.8 +/- 12.2 micrograms/ml in the control group compared with 76.1 +/- 23.9 and 87.1 +/- 20.4 micrograms/ml in the hemodialysis and CAPD groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). The elimination t1/2 of ASL-8123 was prolonged in patients with renal failure, averaging more than 42 hours compared with only 4 hours in the control subjects. Approximately 20% of the esmolol dose as ASL-8123, was removed by either hemodialysis or CAPD, contributing minimally to the elimination of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The results demonstrate that both tests similarly separated this sample into two populations, with 10% belonging to poor metabolizer phenotypes. In addition, the correlation between the metabolic ratios from each test is significant, indicating that they are measuring the same biologic trait and the certainty of correctly identifying the debrisoquin oxidation phenotype of an individual is improved by using the results of both tests.\r"

Respiratory variation of P-P intervals (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) was demonstrated in 84% of subjects; its amplitude decreased with age and respiratory rate. On average, the duration of P-P intervals varied by 2.8% around the mean, and the maximum duration occurred around the time of end-expiration. 4. By cosinor analysis, and allowing for variation of heart rate, P-R intervals showed an independent respiratory variation in 39% of cases, and its average amplitude was 1.2% around the mean. 5. The respiratory variation of P-R and P-P intervals showed similar phase relationships to respiration, suggesting that during respiration there is parallel alteration of sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function.\r"

At 120 min after the start of infusion, arginine vasopressin (AVP) was injected intramuscularly. Urine was collected in 30 min fractions before and after AVP administration. 2. The urinary excretions of kallikrein-like activity (KAL-A) (S-2266 hydrolysis activity) and immunoreactive kinins (i-kinins) were significantly lower in patients with DI than in normal subjects before AVP administration, while there were no differences in plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, creatinine clearance and blood pressure between the two groups, except for a marked water diuresis in patients with DI. The urinary excretion of KAL-A and i-kinins correlated positively with the urinary excretion of AVP. 3. AVP administration increased both plasma AVP and urinary excretion of AVP to similar levels in both groups. As a result, urine volume decreased to a greater degree in patients with DI than in normal subjects. In contrast, the urinary excretions of KAL-A and i-kinins were increased by AVP administration, with a greater response in normal subjects than in the patients with DI. 4. After overnight fasting, acute water loading was carried out orally for 15 min in six normal subjects. At 30 min plasma AVP was suppressed by water loading to almost the basal level found in patients with DI. Urinary excretions of KAL-A and i-kinins in the first 30 min fraction after loading were also suppressed to the basal level in patients with DI. Later, the urinary excretion of KAL-A increased together with the increase in urine flow. Urine volume and free water clearance markedly increased except in the first 30 min fraction, compared with the control period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Methionine and the transamination intermediates were measured in 10 normal subjects, in six normal subjects after L-methionine loading (0.1 g/kg body weight) and in a male patient with hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6) deficiency. 5. In the patient with methionine adenosyltransferase deficiency, at least 20% of methionine was degraded via transamination. In normal subjects transamination of methionine did exist but was quantitatively not important in methionine catabolism, not even after methionine loading. 6. The results of this study might be of importance for future studies on the role of methanethiol in hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

Liver biopsies were performed in healthy control subjects and in subjects with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease in order to examine alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH; aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+); EC 1.2.1.3] activities. Erythrocyte ALDH and ethanol metabolism were also investigated in the same subjects. 2. Fifteen per cent of the subjects studied (seven of 48 subjects tested) presented atypical ADH activity, characterized by elevated activity at pH 7.4 or 8.8 compared with that found in subjects with the usual ADH form. However, the ethanol elimination curves obtained in two subjects with atypical ADH were indistinguishable from the kinetics of the group with normal ADH. Subjects displaying atypical ADH activity showed normal liver and erythrocyte ALDH activities. 3. Considering only the subjects with the normal ADH form, hepatic ADH activity was unaltered in subjects with non-alcoholic liver disease (chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis) and in those with alcoholic steatosis. Subjects with alcoholic hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis showed a lower ADH activity compared with the healthy control group. 4. In spite of the changes detected in subjects with alcoholic liver disease, curves of blood ethanol concentration after oral administration of 0.4 g of ethanol/kg were indistinguishable between the alcoholic hepatitis group and the control group. 5. Hepatic ALDH activity, assayed at 300 mumol/l acetaldehyde, was found to be diminished in all liver pathologies investigated, regardless of their aetiology. Nevertheless, erythrocyte ALDH activity was not modified in subjects with non-alcoholic or alcoholic liver disease. As a result of these findings, no relationship was found between hepatic and erythrocyte ALDH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One patient had a subnormal concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (36 pmol/l) but no other evidence of vitamin D deficiency. 3. The possible biological determinants of the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were sought by multivariate analysis of relevant variables. The serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was found to be significantly and positively correlated with the serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (P less than 0.001) and parathyroid hormone (P less than 0.003), and with the glomerular filtration rate (P less than 0.03), and negatively correlated with the serum concentrations of calcium (P less than 0.02) and phosphate (P = 0.055) (multiple R = 0.638, P less than 0.002). 4. In primary hyperparathyroidism the major determinant of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the availability of precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 5. The finding that serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is commonly normal in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism despite an adequate state of vitamin D nutrition, can be explained in terms of the constraining influences of hypercalcaemia and variable degrees of renal dysfunction on the biosynthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.\r"

We studied the incidence of gastric colonization and its relation to other infections and antibiotic therapy in 25 critically ill ICU patients. All patients received 12-h NG Mylanta II and 15 received an H2-receptor antagonist. All patients had bacterial colonization of NG contents within 4 days of ICU admission and 10 had Candida colonization within 8 days. There were 70 NG isolates and the same isolates were found in tracheobronchial secretions (n = 46), blood (n = 4), urine (n = 4), and wounds (n = 8). Tracheobronchial colonization was preceded by NG colonization with the same organism in 12 instances (11 patients), was concurrent with NG colonization in 20 instances (14 patients), was followed by NG colonization in 14 instances (11 patients), and had no similar NG isolate in 18 instances (11 patients). NG culture of the same organism preceded four of eight positive blood cultures. In 35 of 70 NG isolates and five of 11 subsequent tracheobronchial isolates, colonization occurred despite concurrent appropriate antibiotics. We conclude that colonization of alkalinized NG contents is universal, is a common source of infection in other areas, and is not prevented by systemic antibiotic therapy. Local antibiotic therapy may be important in controlling this important source of infection.\r"

Overall differences detected between H vs. HD tend to favor HD as a resuscitative solution.\r"

  ".W": "Signal processing was applied to normal ECGs to study whether the results could predict coronary artery disease (CAD) on angiography. ECGs determined to be normal by conventional criteria for 116 white males and 84 white females were subjected to signal processing. The technique applied nonlinear mathematical transformation to a segment of seven ECG leads which were photographically imaged, automatically digitized, normalized for time, and had topographical coordinate transformation using an IBM-XT microcomputer. The resulting curvilinear display on the computer monitor was termed a biopotential coordinate transformation (BCT). Successive superimposition of BCTs from normal ECGs of patients with normal angiograms developed boundaries of a normal template for each lead. Study BCTs were then compared to the normal templates to predict the presence or absence of CAD. Correlation of the BCT results with the severity of CAD for the males resulted in average sensitivities of 80%, 84.4%, and 91.7% for single, double, and triple-vessel CAD, respectively. Similarly, for the females average sensitivities were 59.1%, 73.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. In past studies on the same population, the BCT process detected CAD with average sensitivity of 85.1% and specificity of 81.8% for white males and average sensitivity of 73% and specificity 81% for white females. As such, computerized signal processing of ECGs may provide a noninvasive method for detection of CAD in patients with seemingly normal resting ECGs. The results of this study indicate that the sensitivity of the process increases in direct proportion to the severity of CAD. Further investigation is warranted for process refinement and verification.\r"

In two catheter positions, 25 ml of iopamidol 612 mg/ml was delivered from a portable angiographic injector at a flow of 20 ml/sec. A portable x-ray was taken immediately before completion of syringe excursion. Major central pulmonary emboli were seen in three patients and a negative angiogram was obtained on the fourth. Two of the three positive diagnoses were confirmed at pulmonary embolectomy. The negative diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy. Pulmonary angiography via a flow-directed catheter enabled precise and rapid diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in patients too ill to transfer for formal angiography.\r"

The aims of the study were to assess the effect of increasing Hct concentration on Dextrostix readings, and to determine whether plasma samples, in contrast to conventional whole blood samples, were acceptable for Dextrostix determinations in selected cases. Dextrostix readings were determined on 65 whole blood samples of varying Hct, and on plasma specimens, 48 of which were paired with whole blood samples. The results were compared with plasma true glucose values. Plasma Dextrostix readings correlated well with true glucose values throughout the entire Hct range (r = .94, slope = 1.16). Whole blood Dextrostix readings, on the other hand, were Hct-dependent and, with increasing Hct values, became falsely low. As a result, a Hct values greater than 70%, whole blood Dextrostix readings were less than 50% of the true glucose value (r = .94, slope = 0.45). Plasma Dextrostix determinations may offer an accurate means of screening for neonatal hypoglycemia in asymptomatic infants with high Hct, pending laboratory glucose results.\r"

Fifty-one percent of these patients had a high probability lung scan at the initiation of treatment. In comparison, in patients referred with suspected venous thrombosis, but who on subsequent objective testing did not have venous thrombosis (n = 44), the prevalence of a high probability-scan for pulmonary embolus was only 5 percent. At repeat lung scanning, performed after one week of anticoagulant treatment, complete to partial improvement was observed in 68 percent of the patients with initially abnormal scans. Lung-scan detected asymptomatic pulmonary embolism occurs frequently in patients presenting with symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, and the majority of these emboli showed significant to complete resolution within one week of anticoagulant treatment.\r"

Subjects were drawn from a randomly selected sample of the population of Tucson, AZ. Exactly the same protocol, methods, and equipment were employed in both studies. Although very few of these healthy subjects had abnormal function, there were significant differences in most indices of function between smokers and nonsmokers. However, we could discern no difference between smokers and nonsmokers in change in function over five years. It appears that, in smokers who remain free of serious respiratory trouble, there are subtle changes which accumulate over the years and which are too gradual to detect over a five-year interval.\r"

This knowledge allows the patient to choose institution of mechanical ventilation before acute respiratory failure or no intervention and preparation for a natural death. To assist patients and families in this decision making, a special clinic was established. Thirty adolescent boys with DMD were followed up. Eighteen boys reached the end stage of their disease. Three died of cardiac failure. Prediction of respiratory failure was possible in 14 of the remaining 15; 11 of the 15 were able to make educated choices regarding respirator assistance or a natural death. The clinic has shown that in the majority of cases, when properly educated, patients and families can be active participants in life-and-death decisions.\r"

The mean LVI, peak early (E) and late diastolic (A) and LVO velocities were measured at the end of both the hyperpneic and apneic phases. The phasic hemodynamic changes observed during Cheyne-Stokes respiration by Doppler profile could be explained by the development of LV diastolic dysfunction and a decrease in LV stroke volume during the apneic phase of Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Alternatively, an increase in PCO2 during the apneic phase may increase pulmonary vascular resistance lowering preload and stroke volume, whereas during the hyperpneic phase, pulmonary vascular resistance is reduced with resultant increase in left ventricular preload and increase in stroke volume. Both theories are speculative and the precise hemodynamic changes associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration requires further investigation.\r"

We found that there was a significant right shift in the frontal axis with increasing lung volume. Over the precordium, R wave amplitude decreased mainly at the lateral leads and S wave amplitude increased chiefly at the anterior leads. These results are consistent with a normal vertical shift and clockwise rotation of the heart with increasing lung volume.\r"

We measured the chemiluminescence and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity in the PBMs and HAMs of 12 lung cancer patients and 20 healthy subjects; the latter included ten smokers and ten nonsmokers. The PBMs were prepared by using a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient, then separated by Petri-dish adherence. The HAMs were taken during the bronchoalveolar lavages. The chemiluminescence in the HAMs of smokers was significantly higher than nonsmokers, (p less than 0.05), which did not occur in the PBMs. Chemiluminescence in HAMs from the lung cancer patients was also significantly higher than the smoker control subjects (p less than 0.01). However, the lung cancer patients had significantly lower ADCC activity than the smokers in the control group (4.52 +/- 2.96 vs 8.27 +/- 2.83 percent; p less than 0.05). The chemiluminescence in the PBMs showed no statistical difference between the lung cancer patients and smoker control, but PBMs of the lung cancer patients had significantly lower ADCC activity than the smoker normal control group. The HAMs from lung cancer patients produced more superoxide anion, for an increased chemiluminescence reaction was noted, although ADCC activity was lower than in smokers, ie, HAMs were ineffective in killing tumors. Environmental factors such as cigarette smoking affect HAM's function by causing an increase of superoxide anion production. The chemiluminescence and ADCC activity in the PBMs does not always correspond to the HAMs findings. These results suggest that PBMs can not accurately reflect or predict the HAMs' function in lung diseases.\r"

Correlation of best of three measurements was FEV1-JPF r = .758; FEV1-WPF r = .744; and JPF-WPF r = .846. The mean percent predicted of the best of three values of FEV1 was 74.8 percent, JPF 91.4 percent, and WPF 94 percent. These higher values for percent predicted PEFR were obtained throughout the range of FEV1 values. Studies on nine normal volunteers in an atmospheric chamber suggested that higher altitudes may account for higher PEFR values. We conclude that PEFR, measured by either waterless spirometer or mini-Wright peak flow meter, has greater intrasubject variability than FEV1, and it tends to underestimate the degree of pulmonary impairment.\r"

Methylprednisolone (100 mg) or physiologic saline solution was given within one-half hour of arrival in the Emergency Department. Spirometry was performed initially and after the third and fifth aerosol treatments. We found no greater improvement in FEV1 in the group receiving the steroid (37 percent) than in the control group (43 percent; NS). There was also no difference in the rate of hospitalization (33 percent in the steroid-treated group vs 30 percent in the control group; NS).

  ".W": "Rapid exposure of unacclimatized persons to high altitude causes the syndrome acute mountain sickness (AMS). Prophylactic treatment with frequent high doses of dexamethasone has been shown to prevent AMS. To determine whether lower, less frequent doses were effective in preventing AMS, 28 men between the ages of 18 and 32 were exposed to a simulated altitude of 4,570 m for 45 h in a hypobaric chamber on two occasions while taking one of three doses of dexamethasone (4 mg, 1 mg, or .25 mg every 12 h) or a placebo in a double-blind, crossover design. The 4-mg dose of dexamethasone reduced the incidence of AMS symptoms compared with placebo and the other dose levels. Dexamethasone did not alter fluid balance or plasma volume changes, but treatment with 1 mg and 4 mg suppressed cortisol secretion. There was no evidence of adrenal cortical suppression after treatment with dexamethasone or placebo 48 h after discontinuing altitude exposure and drug treatment. The results indicate that 4 mg of dexamethasone twice daily is an effective prophylactic treatment for AMS, while lower doses are relatively ineffective.\r"

There were no significant differences in expression of the immunologic markers CD13(My7), CD14(My4), and Monocyte-2 on blood monocytes between the patient groups and healthy volunteers, but there were marked differences between groups in the expression of the three markers on BAL macrophages. The percentage of Monocyte-2+ macrophages was increased in BAL in subjects with sarcoidosis, EAA, and IPF compared with healthy volunteers, greatest in EAA. This increase is probably due to increased recruitment of blood monocytes into alveoli, since the cells had a monocytic morphology on phase contrast microscopy (in normal subjects the majority of blood monocytes, but few alveolar macrophages, express the Monocyte-2 antigen). Patients with IPF had a significantly lower percentage of CD13(My7)+ macrophages in BAL than the other three groups. Compared with IPF patients and healthy volunteers, patients with EAA had a significantly higher percentage of CD14(My4)+ macrophages, whereas in sarcoidosis patients the numbers were reduced. These observations suggest an increased influx of blood monocytes into the alveoli in interstitial lung disorders. Phenotypic differences were found between the BAL macrophage populations of the various interstitial diseases. These differences in alveolar macrophage phenotype may be due to local factors, depending on the type of inflammation.\r"

Response with aeration of the atelectatic lung was seen in 12 patients (21 percent). Three patients (5 percent) showed partial response with persistent partial atelectasis, and nine patients (16 percent) showed good response with complete aeration of the atelectatic lung. In these patients the response appeared to be related to the dose of radiation. All of the patients who responded received more than 50 Gy. The difference in the response rate related to the dose of radiation was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The rates were similar with all histologic types of NSCC. Regardless of the clinical response observed, bronchoscopy performed two to four months after completion of radiation therapy in 14 patients revealed persistent endobronchial tumor. There was no significant relationship between the persistence of endobronchial tumor, the dose of radiation therapy, and the tumor's histologic type. Of the 12 patients with radiographic improvement in atelectasis, fibrotic changes developed in four (33 percent) patients and pneumonitis in two (17 percent). Progression of disease with distant metastases occurred in 58 percent (seven) of the 12 patients who showed a clinical response of their bronchial obstruction.

Chronic bronchitis occurred in 26.2 percent of nonsmoking fanciers and increased in prevalence as antibody levels rose (p less than 0.001). Although significantly more common (p less than 0.005) in the 85 (29.6 percent) fanciers who also had typical delayed symptoms of pigeon breeders' disease (PBD), chronic bronchitis was the only manifestation of the disease in 24 (8.4 percent) of the population surveyed. Chronic bronchitis was not related to the intensity or duration of avian exposure suggesting that host factors are more important in its pathogenesis. Chronic bronchitis must be considered to be an integral part of the clinical spectrum of PBD.\r"

We evaluated SvO2 monitoring in 24 patients suffering from complicated myocardial infarctions. Cardiac output and arterial lactate levels were measured when there were persistent 5 percent changes in SvO2, and otherwise, every 12 hours or as indicated clinically. Increases in SvO2 by 5 and 10 percent corresponded with an increase in cardiac index in 78.5 percent and 75 percent of measurements, respectively. Decreases in SvO2 by 5 and 10 percent corresponded with decreases in cardiac index in 45.5 percent and 61 percent of measurements. Twenty percent changes in cardiac index showed dissimilar directional changes with SvO2 in 62 percent of cases. Arterial blood lactate levels correlated poorly with SvO2. Survivors had significantly higher mean SvO2 and cardiac indices than nonsurvivors (p less than 0.01). The clinical management of patients with myocardial infarction may not be altered in view of the limitations of SvO2 in reflecting tissue hypoxia. We conclude that continuous monitoring of SvO2 may not be a sensitive measure of cardiac output after acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Clinical indications and lack of expertise were the main reasons proferred for limited use; however, cost (which was generally underestimated) and clinical value also were mentioned. The majority of CCUs did not use PACs, and only 10 percent used more than two/month. Only 10 percent of hospitals have used them perioperatively and most cardiothoracic units used no more than two PACs/month. In view of the large difference in numbers used between the United Kingdom and the United States, a large-scale study is warranted to determine the actual value of PACs in reducing mortality and morbidity.\r"

The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) abnormalities were compared with parameters conventionally used to evaluate NIC. All studies were carried out within 24 h of NIC and repeated 24 h later. Ventilation (p less than 0.001) and perfusion (p less than 0.01) abnormalities were more extensive soon after NIC than suggested by chest roentgenograms. Chest x-ray film changes lagged behind V/Q changes on admission and also after 24 h. The extent of ventilation, perfusion, and chest x-ray film abnormalities on admission were all predictors of increased morbidity. V/Q studies may be useful to define the extent as well as the changes in regional lung function following NIC.\r"

This can be accomplished by IRV in which the controlled mode of mechanical ventilation is adjusted such that the inspiratory cycle is prolonged and the expiratory phase is shortened. Studies were done on six anesthetized, nasally intubated sheep. Simulated mucus was instilled into the bronchi at 15-min intervals during I-E ratio of 1:2.7, 1.9:1, and 3:1. The IRV modes of 1.9:1 and 3:1 promoted transport of simulated mucus outward. Neither systemic blood pressure nor cardiac output were altered by IRV. Thus, IRV might be useful in the management of excessive bronchial secretions in mechanically ventilated patients. However, clinical trials of IRV should take into account its potential for producing adverse hemodynamic effects and barotrauma in patients with compromised cardiac function due to auto-PEEP attendant with its usage.\r"

The mechanism of trauma was penetrating in 233 of 242 patients. Most, if not all, colonic lesions were treated with either exteriorization, resection and no anastomosis, or closure and proximal colostomy. Mortality related to colonic injury was 2.5 percent. Morbidity related to colonic injury included wound infection, 6.3 percent; abscess, 2.5 percent; other, 3.3 percent. Despite the severity of the trauma, adherence to conservative principles of \"no anastomosis\" in the overwhelming majority of cases has resulted in low morbidity and mortality.\r"

Simultaneous anal pressure records demonstrate the nature of the sphincter activity during simulated defecation. The test was performed on 19 patients with constipation and on 14 controls. Five patients could not evacuate the simulated stool, while five others could, but more laboriously than the remaining nine patients whose defecation was comparable with the controls. Laborious defecation is characterized by longer duration and more performed work during evacuation. Every patient with difficult or ineffective evacuation had sphincter contraction during defecation, whereas this phenomenon was not observed in patients with normal defecation. Defecometry permits more adequate identification and characterization of the outlet-obstruction-type constipated patients than the simple balloon expulsion test and the analysis of sphincter activity during straining with empty rectum in lateral decubitus. Early diagnosis and treatment of patients with outlet obstruction is important to avoid late neuromuscular damage to the pelvic floor.\r"

A balloon is used to simulate semisolid and solid stool. This test is a more realistic approach to the evaluation of fecal continence than the rectal saline infusion test and anal manometry. The test evaluates the rectal reservoir function, sensation, and sphincter competence simultaneously; however, the real rectal distensibility and compliance must be determined by compliance measurement until the maximal tolerable level for patients in a reclining position is reached. This test also permits objective evaluation of the effect of different treatments in incontinent patients.\r"

All patients had abdominal pain and sepsis during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. CT scanning was diagnostic in six patients thought to have typhlitis. Two patients were not diagnosed before exploratory laparotomy. The authors have found nonoperative treatment highly effective in patients who do not manifest signs of peritonitis, perforation, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or clinical deterioration. Recurrent typhlitis was frequent after conservative therapy (recurrence rate, 67 percent), however. One patient underwent an elective right hemicolectomy after a second episode, and typhlitis did not recur despite neutropenia associated with a subsequent course of chemotherapy. It is concluded that successful treatment of this disease hinges on: 1) early diagnosis provided by a high index of suspicion and the use of CT scanning, 2) nonoperative treatment for uncomplicated cases, and 3) elective right hemicolectomy to prevent recurrence.\r"

Dukes' Staging System, which originally was described for use in rectal cancer, gives as good a prognostic separation as any of the other staging systems, some of which include serosal involvement as a staging criteria, which cannot be used for cancer of the extraperitoneal part of the rectum. It is furthermore demonstrated that an important prognostic separation can be obtained by dividing the B group of Dukes' Staging System into tumors that reach the surface of the muscularis propria and those with demonstrable invasion of extrarectal structures, the latter having as bad a prognosis as Dukes' C tumors.\r"

The rate of wound infection, and/or intra-abdominal abscess formation was retrospectively reviewed and found to be completely nonexistent in these patients.

Drainage volume per 24 hours was measured, and volume of residual pelvic fluid collection estimated by CT scan on the seventh postoperative day. A mean of 591.9 +/- 415.2 ml of fluid drained during the first seven postoperative days. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in 24 hour drainage volume between the fourth and sixth postoperative days. There was no significant difference in drainage volumes between the two drainage methods. Residual pelvic fluid collection (median volume, 16 ml) was detected in 80 percent of patients at one week after operation. While this was larger (24 ml median) for the corrugated only group compared with the corrugated plus sump drain group (11.5 ml median), the difference was not significant. Fluid loss during the first postoperative week (616.6 +/- 424.2 ml) was significantly (P less than 0.05) less when the anastomosis was situated higher than 12 cm (294 +/- 192 ml) compared with 6 to 12 cm from the anal margin (496 +/- 210 ml), or after coloanal anastomosis (1077 +/- 432 ml). Residual pelvic fluid collection was larger after coloanal anastomosis (median, 33 ml; range, 1.5 to 90 ml) compared with 6 to 12 cm (median, 11 ml; range, 0-124 ml) or higher than 12 cm (median 9 ml; range, 0 to 16 ml) from the anal margin, but the difference was not significant. Drainage after anterior resection is important because large volumes of serosanguineous fluid collect, especially after resection of low tumors. Neither of the drainage methods tested in this study prevented persisting pelvic fluid collection at the seventh postoperative day.\r"

The pigment stained with diastase-alcian blue PAS, Fontana, and iron stains. One hundred nineteen of 200 (59.5 percent) bowels showed melanosis, which was equally common in both sexes. Usually more than one segment was involved (most commonly, four segments). Melanosis was common in the proximal part of the colon, but much rarer in distal parts (sigmoid and rectum). Affected segments were successive; negative segments between positive ones were exceptional. If the rectum was affected, all five proximal segments were affected in 11 of 12 cases. The intensity of melanosis was directly related to the number of segments involved. In the oral part of the colon, affected males had a higher intensity of melanosis than affected women, but about the same intensity in the sigmoid and rectum. The fraction of patients with melanosis increased with age. Of men and women in the age group of 20 to 54 years, 32 and 44 percent were affected, and above the age of 75 years, 76 and 67 percent, respectively.\r"

In the present communication, clinical features of FAC have been compared in detail to detect differences between familial and nonfamilial cases with regard to colonic and extracolonic lesions and to discover whether they constitute the same disease entities. No significant difference was found in the incidence of extracolonic lesions. The average number of colonic polyps in the nonfamilial cases of patients over 30 years old was 1128, the number of polyps was significantly higher in the familial cases (3154). When three patients with approximately 100 polyps were excluded, the mean number of colonic polyps in nonfamilial cases became 2608. This was similar to that of familial cases. Furthermore, the occurrence of approximately 100 polyps was extremely rare in familial patients who were over 30 years old. Therefore, most of the nonfamilial cases can be considered to be familial probands of FAC, but some, such as the three cases in the present study, may be a different disease entity, such as recessive adenomatous polyposis or multiple colonic adenomas.\r"

Serial sections revealed the existence of a luminal communication between the two lesions. The tumor tissue was seen mainly in the muscularis propria with no mucosal involvement. The papillary portion had a highly differentiated appearance, giving rise to considerable difficulty in determining whether it was benign or malignant. In a localized area, however, the tumor invaded into the subserosa and showed distinctive atypical changes. The tumor cells showed intense reactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen. This mucinous cystadenocarcinoma was considered to be originated from an enterogenous cyst, a possible derivative of duplication of the colon.

Autopsy data of all patients who received EVS and who died (32 patients, 100%) during this period were available to confirm the diagnosis of perforation. Esophageal perforation was confirmed in 5 (2.9%) and was seen in patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease. Importantly, most patients did not manifest features of an esophageal leak, but presented instead as a deterioration in condition and died after a mean (+/- SD) 14 +/- 5.2 days. Analysis of the clinical and EVS data reveals that the risk of developing perforation is high when EVS is performed during active bleeding. The extravariceal location of sclerosant and microabscesses may be important predisposing factors. In our experience large-dose injection, deep ulceration, and balloon tamponade are less likely predisposing factors of this complication.\r"

To examine this possibility, HLA phenotyping was prospectively performed on 40 patients with documented achalasia (24 Caucasian, 16 blacks). Results showed a positive association for the class II HLA antigen, DQw1, with 83% of Caucasians (P less than 0.02) and 86% of blacks having the antigen (NS). The relative risk for developing achalasia with the presence of DQw1 was 4.2 in Caucasians and 3.6 in blacks. A negative correlation for the DRw53 antigen was noted in Caucasian patients with a relative risk of 0.23. These results indicate an immunogenetic association for achalasia and provide insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine whether gallbladder emptying, endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion, or their interrelation is altered in patients with gallstones. After intraduodenal administration of 60 ml corn oil, plasma CCK concentration was measured by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay and gallbladder emptying by cholescintigraphy. Patients with gallstones (N = 20) produced significantly less endogenous CCK (105 +/- 17 pmol/liter 60 min; P less than 0.001) than control subjects (191 +/- 11 pmol/liter 60 min, N = 20); gallbladder emptying in the patients was significantly decreased at 5, 10, 40, 45, and 50 min but the reduction in gallbladder emptying did not reach statistical significance at 60 min (patients 44 +/- 8%, control subjects 60 +/- 4%). In addition, the gallbladder responsiveness to intravenous infusion of the synthetic CCK analog cerulein was investigated. Based on the results of gallbladder emptying in response to endogenous and exogenous CCK, four subgroups of gallstone patients were identified: (1) a group (N = 7) with normal gallbladder sensitivity to CCK, (2) a group (N = 6) with significantly increased gallbladder sensitivity to CCK, (3) a group (N = 6) with impaired gallbladder emptying after corn oil due to a significantly reduced endogenous CCK secretion but with normal gallbladder sensitivity to CCK, and (4) one patient whose gallbladder was unresponsive to CCK and was found to have chronic cholecystitis at surgery.\r"

The contractile responses to cholecystokinin-octapeptide and acetylcholine were dependent on the presence of calcium in the bath, with a 40-100% reduction in contraction when buffer with no added calcium was used. In contrast, the contractile response to histamine was unchanged when stimulation was carried out in low calcium buffer. The contractions of the guinea pig gallbladder induced by cholecystokinin-octapeptide and acetylcholine, but not histamine, appear to require near-physiologic levels of extracellular calcium.\r"

In these last 33 patients, the motor activity of the sphincter of Oddi was similar to that recorded in nine control subjects without pancreatic or biliary diseases. In the suspected Oddi dysfunction cases, both the basal sphincteric pressure and the frequency of the phasic contractions were significantly elevated (P less than 0.001). Patients with biliary cystic dilatation showed an increased basal pressure, but the frequency of the contractions was elevated in only those with choledochal cysts and the amplitude in only one of the two patients with Caroli's disease. Motor disorders of the sphincter of Oddi provide a basis for an alternative etiopathogenesis of cystic disease of the biliary system and a possible explanation for pain and dilatation of the bile duct in patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\r"

Physiological reflux was more extensive than expected on the basis of widely used normal values. The percentage of time with pH less than 4 and the duration of the reflux episodes increased with age. Of the more than 2000 esophageal contractions occurring per day, peristaltic contractions constituted 50.9 +/- 2.0%. Their amplitude was significantly lower between meals than during meals and during the night. The duration of the peristaltic contractions increased with age. Simultaneous contractions constituted 10.4 +/- 1.2% of the esophageal contractions. Their incidence increased with age. We conclude that continuous ambulatory 24-hr recording with automated analysis of esophageal motility and pH profile is feasible, that the upper limits of normal in ambulatory esophageal pH recording are higher than previously accepted, and that age, meals, and body position must be taken into account in the interpretation of both 24-hr esophageal pH and pressure data.\r"

  ".U": "89152712\r", 
  ".W": "Although the role of inflammatory processes in the genesis of late changes in the gastrointestinal tract following exposure to ionizing irradiation has been extensively studied, few studies have concentrated on the presence of an acute inflammatory response in the period immediately following radiation. We therefore examined, in rats, whether the local application of 10 Gy cobalt-60 irradiation to the abdomen led to changes in the gut within the first 24 hr that were consistent with an acute inflammatory response. In stomach, small intestine, and colon, local irradiation led to a significant increase in the accumulation of plasma within the tissue by 4-8 hr following irradiation. This increase in tissue plasma volume, indicative of an increased microvascular permeability, was then sustained until the end of the 24-hr assessment period in all tissues examined. Concurrent with this was a consistent transient increase in tissue red blood cell volume, suggestive of vasodilation. Of particular note, a significant increase in the number of mucosal neutrophils was also observed between 2 and 12 hr following irradiation. This elevation in mucosal neutrophils was particularly marked in the pericryptal or deep mucosal regions of small intestine and colon and consistently preceded the vasodilation and enhanced permeability. Furthermore these pathophysiological alterations occurred at a time when histological changes in the mucosa consistent with an impaired mucosal microcirculation (ie, edema of the lamina propria and subepithelial bleb formation) were present. These results support the hypothesis that an inflammatory response occurs in the gut during the first 24 hr following abdominal irradiation. Such changes may then further exacerbate the damage initiated by the ionizing radiation.\r"

  ".W": "A proline-specific carboxypeptidase (carboxypeptidase P, EC 3.4.12.-) was identified and partially characterized in the brush border membrane fraction of rat intestinal enterocytes and shown to be distinct from pancreatic proteases. The carboxypeptidase activity of isolated brush border membranes, with Z-Gly-Pro-Leu as substrate, was 43 nmol/min/mg protein representing a 16-fold purification when compared with mucosal cell homogenates. Activity was maximal in the middle region of the small intestine, and villus cells had twice the activity of crypt cells. Carboxypeptidase activity was maximal at pH 7.0, was stimulated by divalent cations, and was inhibited by metal chelating agents, suggesting that it is a metalloenzyme. The enzyme had the highest activity with synthetic peptides containing proline penultimate to the carboxy terminus. In vivo patterns of hydrolysis and absorption of amino acids from Z-Pro-Trp were examined using an intestinal perfusion technique. These studies indicate that brush border membrane carboxypeptidase may play an important role in the digestion of proline-containing peptides and proteins.\r"

In addition, smoking, being black, and early relapse since the last ulcer attack were found to be associated with increased duration required for healing. The results of this pilot study suggest factors, in addition to smoking, that may have to be considered in future studies concerned with duodenal ulcer healing.\r"

The existence of cytoprotective products that are released by the gastric mucosa in response to its exposure to a mild irritant is assessed in this work. Gastric contents of rats exposed to a mild irritant (0.3 N HCl) or to 0.3 N NaCl (control) were collected, titrated to neutrality, and administered orally to prefasted animals followed by 100% ethanol. Ethanol-induced gross hemorrhagic injury in rats pretreated with the 0.3 N HCl gastric contents were significantly less than in control treated rats (P less than 0.01). Pretreating the donor or recipient rats with indomethacin did not interfere with the generation or protective action of the 0.3 N HCl gastric contents. These findings demonstrate that the exposure of the gastric mucosa to a mild irritant causes the release of protective products, which are different from prostaglandins, into the gastric lumen.\r"

The follow-up period was defined as the period from diagnosis to death in those who died and to the present in those still alive. The following conclusions were obtained. (1) Patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis showed a significantly higher mortality rate (26.2%) and cancer death rate (8.3%) than the age- and sex-matched population. In patients with nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis, however, the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance, although both rates tended to be higher. (2) Patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis showed a significantly poorer prognosis than those with nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis. (3) Frequent causes of death in chronic pancreatitis were cancer (11 cases) and diabetes-associated conditions (renal failure in three cases, intractable pneumonia in one, hypoglycemic shock in two, and myocardial infarction in two). Death directly from pancreatitis was observed in four. (4) Unfavorable prognostic factors in alcoholic chronic pancreatitis included heavy drinking, continuance of drinking after diagnosis, smoking, insulin-dependent diabetes, and an advanced age. In nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis, however, patients' age was the only significant prognostic factor; smoking did not reach the level of statistical significance, although it tended to lead to a poorer prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "The relative efficacy of three commercial pancreatic enzyme supplements in improving fat absorption was studied using the [14C]triolein breath test in 12 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Two of the supplements were enteric coated. The one nonenteric coated product was studied twice: with and without ranitidine coadministration. Doses complied with the manufacturers recommendations. Baseline studies included pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acids, 72-hr fecal fat excretion, and [14C]triolein absorption while not on supplementation. Acid outputs were variable (BAO: 0.3-4.1 meq/hr; MAO: 3.5-34.6 meq/hr). Three patients had mild steatorrhea (i.e., less than 10 g/day) and the remaining severe fat malabsorption (56.9 +/- 41.5 g/day). Although fat absorption was significantly improved by all three supplements, the nonenteric coated preparation was most effective (P less than 0.001). However, laboratory analysis demonstrated that lipase content was four times greater, ie, 17,000 IU/4 tablets. Pretreatment with ranitidine failed to further improve the absorption in patients given nonenteric supplements but was effective in those found to have high or normal acid outputs (P less than 0.001). Our results suggest that the recommended dosage of enteric coated preparations is insufficient for adult patients with severe chronic pancreatitis. Secondly, the marked variability of acid secretion in such patients possibly accounts for the variability of results obtained by others on the usefulness of coadministration of antacids and H2 antagonists. Routine measurement of gastric acid secretion status may help optimize the choice and form of pancreatic enzyme supplementation.\r"

A significant but transient decrease in the plasma cholecystokinin level was observed in response to peptide YY under oleate stimulation. The present study demonstrates that peptide YY has a potent inhibitory effect on both exogenously and endogenously stimulated pancreatic secretion and has a mild suppressive effect on fatty acid-induced cholecystokinin release suggesting that this peptide is an important colonic inhibitor of pancreatic secretion.\r"

Plasma concentration of rat PP and the effect of exogenous infusion of rat PP on pancreatic secretions during BPJ diversion were determined. Plasma PP concentration significantly increased with BPJ diversion and peaked at 90 min after BPJ diversion began, almost paralleling changes in protein output. Exogenous PP infusion (1, 2 and 10 micrograms/kg/hr) inhibited pancreatic protein and fluid outputs but not the bicarbonate output during BPJ diversion. PP was shown to be physiologically released in the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion; however, the physiological role of endogenous PP remains unknown.\r"

  ".W": "Carcinoid tumors are the most frequent gut neuroendocrine tumors accounting for more than 50% of all tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) axis. These tumors appear to derive from a stem cell line capable of differentiating into a variety of malignant cells that secrete many different peptides and amines. The symptoms of carcinoid tumors are often non-specific, vague abdominal pain that may precede the diagnosis by a median of 9 years. Carcinoid syndrome occurs in less than 10% of patients. We evaluated the effects of SMS 201-995 in 14 such patients, 12 with diarrhea, 8 with flushing, 3 with wheezing, one with tricuspid valve incompetence, 6 with facial telangiectasia, 3 with a pellagra type dermatosis and one with myopathy. Diarrhea was abolished or significantly reduced in 83%, flushing in 100%, wheezing in 100%, and myopathy improved in the one patient. Blood serotonin was resistant to change, urine 5HIAA fell in 75%, and most gut neuropeptide hormones apart from somatostatin were suppressed. Tumor growth appeared to be slowed in 2/3 of cases treated for up to 4 years. The analog of somatostatin appears to be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for carcinoid tumors and the symptom complex.\r"

  ".W": "In order to study outcome of pregnancy related to timing of conception it is necessary to have both markers of ovulation and records of intercourse. Natural family planning (NFP) charts where the woman records basal body temperature (BBT) and mucus signs are ideal for this purpose. Much work has been done relating timing of BBT and mucus signs to ovulation, but very little work has been done to examine interobserver agreement on the interpretation of these signs. Four NFP experts examined 28 NFP pregnancy charts to determine the BBT rise, the mucus peak, and two most likely days of conception intercourse. The charts were selected because they provided difficulties in interpretation. The reviewers were able to agree on the most probable day of conception intercourse in 96.4% of cases, on the mucus peak in 74.1% of cases, and on the interval between the most probable conception intercourse and mucus peak in 70.4% of cases. There was poor agreement on the first day of the BBT rise (38.5%). The authors conclude that in selected difficult NFP charts, the mucus peak is a more valid indirect measure of ovulation both because it is subject to less interobserver variation and because it more closely approximates the timing of ovulation.\r"

The sterilized women had experienced contraceptive side effects and failures more often than the men. Only 70% of the laparoscopic sterilizations could be carried out during a 1-day admission, 25% of the women complained about long-term sequelae, and there were 1% failures. The vasectomies were carried out on an outpatient basis, there were few postoperative symptoms, and 0.5% failures were recorded. Female sterilization was at least four times as expensive as vasectomy. It is concluded that vasectomy is generally to be preferred to female sterilization, and that the preoperative guidance should involve both man and wife.\r"

One hundred twenty-one transfers were performed in a natural cycle and 18 pregnancies were achieved (15%), from which 14 were ongoing (12%). Overall, 52% of the thawed embryos retained at least 50% of their initial blastomeres intact after thawing, and were replaced. Survival was strongly correlated to prefreezing embryonic quality, as 78% of type I embryos, 55% of type II, 40% of type III, and none of type IV could be transferred. Implantations were obtained from type I embryos (21% per embryo replaced) and from type II (14.5%), whereas none of the type III embryos resulted in a pregnancy. In the authors' experience, using the DMSO protocol, the best pregnancy rates were achieved when replacing 8-cell embryos of high morphologic prefreezing quality. No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated, however, in implantation rates between 8-cell and 4-cell embryos, or between synchronously and asynchronously dividing concepti.\r"

The means for the different semen/sperm variables were within ranges published for fertile men. Ages of the men ranged from 22 to 55 years and accounted for a small amount of variation. Sperm counts were lowest in September, December, and January, and highest in April, May, October, and November. Of the sperm characteristics, morphology appeared to be associated with the most other variables. Specimens with more than 50% abnormal sperm forms were overall of significantly poorer quality in terms of sperm counts, motility, forward progression, and ability to penetrate cervical mucus. Antisperm antibodies (agglutinating and immobilizing) were detected in the serum samples of 19.0% of the men, 20.4% of the women, and 32.8% of the couples where one or both partners were positive. Agglutinating antibody titers were significantly correlated between partners. Serum titers of antisperm antibodies were associated with decreased sperm counts, motility, forward progression, and normal forms (immobilizing antibodies). Multiple correlation analysis indicated significant independent effects of sperm concentration, motility, forward progression, and antibodies on sperm-cervical mucus penetration scores of the men. In women, cervical mucus penetration was adversely affected by the presence in the serum of sperm agglutinating antibodies and of immobilizing activity in the cervical mucus.\r"

Serum DHT was analyzed through 51 days of follow-up. In the DHT-M group, serum DHT was above pretreatment values for 17 days, whereas in the DHT-C group, this period was extended over 50 days. The area under the serum concentration-time curve and the half-life of absorption calculated for the DHT-C group were greater than those obtained for the DHT-M group (55.1 ng/day/ml and 21 days vs. 14.5 ng/day/ml and 6 days; P less than 0.01). The authors conclude that DHT injection appears to be an effective and convenient technique for restoring serum physiologic DHT levels. This approach is suitable for long-term substitution therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic cystoenterostomy was performed in 33 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic cystoduodenostomy (ECD) was done in 22 cases of symptomatic paraduodenal cysts and endoscopic cystogastrostomy (ECG) in 11 cases of retrogastric pseudocysts. The success rates were 96% for ECD and 100% for ECG. The relapse rate was 9% after ECD and 19% after ECG. No significant complications were observed after successful ECD and clinical relief of pain was achieved in 20 patients. ECD was an effective and definitive treatment for 19 of the 22 cases. Two complications of ECG were gastric hemorrhage and iatrogenic pseudocyst infection. In two ECG patients, percutaneous drainage was required. ECG alone was a definitive treatment for 8 of the 11 cases. When restricted to the precise morphological indication (paraintestinal cyst bulging into the duodenal or gastric lumen), ECD is the first choice for treatment of paraduodenal cysts, whereas ECG is an alternative procedure for the drainage of retrogastric pseudocysts, offering at least results as good as percutaneous drainage.\r"

  ".W": "This study determined the optimum laser energy for ablation of colonic mucosal lesions and small sessile polyps in the canine colon. Neodymium (Nd):YAG laser, argon laser, and monopolar electrocautery were applied to exposed canine colonic mucosa for various application times at various power settings. At the minimum energy level necessary to ablate mucosa, the Nd:YAG laser caused greater muscularis injury than the argon laser and monopolar electrocautery. At higher energy levels, monopolar electrocautery and Nd:YAG laser caused greater muscularis injury than argon laser. Small surgically created polyps in the canine colon were ablated endoscopically with the three energy sources. Single-session complete polyp ablation occurred most frequently with Nd:YAG laser and least frequently with argon laser. The depth of tissue injury beneath polyp ablation sites was least with argon laser and greatest with Nd:YAG laser. This study suggests that the argon laser is safer than the Nd:YAG laser or monopolar electrocautery for coagulation of flat colonic mucosal lesions. Although the argon laser is safer for the coagulation of small sessile colonic polyps, it may be less effective than monopolar electrocautery or the Nd:YAG laser for the single-session fulguration of polyps greater than 5 mm in diameter.\r"

Endoscopic measurements with acceptable interobserver variability was demonstrated in the canine stomach. In eight healthy subjects, endoscopic measurement in different areas of the colon and rectum revealed significantly lower IHB values in the splenic flexure. These observations are compatible with reduced flow and increased susceptibility to ischemic damage in this watershed area. The endoscopic measurements in 13 patients with active inflammatory bowel disease revealed an increase in IHB and ISO2 values in the involved areas, indicating an increase in mucosal blood flow. In six patients restudied when the disease remitted, these values returned to normal.\r"

Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either intravenous midazolam or diazepam as premedication for outpatient total colonoscopy by one endoscopist. Fifty-five patients received diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) and 50 received midazolam (0.07 mg/kg). Both patient and endoscopist were blind to the study drug used. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, and indication for colonoscopy. Patients were rated by the endoscopist for degree of cooperation, sedation, and pain during examination. There was significantly more oversedation in the midazolam group than in the diazepam group (p less than 0.05). Immediate procedure recall was less in midazolam patients (p less than 0.005), but on repeat interview the next day there was no difference between the two groups concerning recall of the endoscopy. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of arm pain. We conclude that in a clinical setting, midazolam does not appear to offer any significant advantage over diazepam, except for cost. Midazolam carries an increased risk of oversedation when it is administered on a milligram per kilogram basis and should instead be titrated individually.\r"

Forty of the patients (91%) had gastritis at esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The lesions were distributed in the fundus and corpus of the stomach (77% of the patients), in the esophagus (30% of the patients), in the antrum (25% of the patients), and in the duodenum (7% of the patients). The grade of gastritis at esophagogastroduodenoscopy did not correlate with the severity of the head injury, the type of head injury sustained, the timing of esophagogastroduodenoscopy after head injury, or the presence of shock on admission. However, patients with grade III gastritis had a greater injury Severity Score than patients with grade 0 gastritis (normal mucosa). Gastroduodenal mucosal damage is common after severe head injury and occurs soon after the event.\r"

  ".W": "Postprandial pancreatic secretion results from the interaction of neural and hormonal factors but their contribution to the net postprandial secretion is unknown. Recent description of highly specific and potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists allows the determination of the physiological role of CCK in the postprandial pancreatic secretion. In six dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulae, the blockade of CCK receptors by non-peptidal agent (L-364,718) caused little change in basal pancreatic secretion, but decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) by about 60% the pancreatic protein response to meat feeding and virtually abolished the pancreatic responses to CCK-8 and bombesin. The pancreatic protein responses to pentagastrin, reaching about 37% of CCK maximum, was also significantly reduced but this effect was less pronounced than that observed in tests with CCK-8 or bombesin stimulation. In contrast, cholinergically stimulated pancreatic secretion, reaching about 40% of CCK maximum, was unaffected by L-364,718. Cholecystokinin antagonism also failed to affect the postprandial and bombesin induced increments in plasma CCK and gastrin concentrations, but significantly reduced the PP responses to CCK-8 bombesin and meat feeding possibly as a result of the removal of the CCK mediated release of PP. We conclude that CCK plays a crucial role in the mediation of the postprandial and bombesin induced pancreatic secretion and in the PP release.\r"

Total protein secretion rates did not vary with change in bile salt secretion or bile flow. The protein pattern assessed by SDS-PAGE did not vary with bile salt secretion. The results indicate that bile salt secretion has little influence on biliary protein secretion under these conditions in man. Changes in bile salt secretion were associated with linear change in bile flow, but there was no relationship between bile flow and protein secretion rates. This argues against convective sieving of plasma proteins into bile.\r"

Hydrogen was used without methane production in fermentations of subject 1, but was used for methane formation in fermentations of subject 2. Although the rates of glucose fermentation were similar between both subjects; subject 1 produced a significantly greater molar ratio of propionate than did subject 2.

We measured orocaecal transit in healthy volunteers and in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid patients before and after treatment, using the lactulose hydrogen breath test incorporating a standard liquid meal to obtain a more physiological assessment. Mean transit time in 12 control subjects was 85 (8) minutes (mean (SE)) (mean coefficient of variation between replicate studies, 8.6% (3%)). In eighteen hyperthyroid patients transit was more rapid at 49 (4) minutes (p less than 0.01). Ten hypothyroid patients had a transit time similar to controls at 91 (9) minutes. Transit time returned to normal in thyrotoxic patients after treatment but in eight hypothyroid patients retested, it remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that (a) the inclusion of a liquid meal provides a reproducible method of measuring orocaecal transit using the lactulose hydrogen breath test, (b) rapid small bowel transit in thyrotoxicosis may be one factor in the diarrhoea which is a feature of the disease and (c) if altered gut transit is the cause of sluggish bowel habit in hypothyroidism, delay in the colon, and not small bowel, is likely to be responsible.\r"

It has also been reported that normal menstruating women show changes in upper gut transit between the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle and that patients with constipation show prolonged transit. We therefore studied relationships between symptom severity and orocaecal transit during the menstrual cycle in a group of 14 constipated women and a series of control groups comprising seven normal menstruating women, five postmenopausal women, and eight normal men, to determine whether phases of the menstrual cycle were associated with alteration in symptoms or transit. A regular menstrual cycle was reported by 13 of the 14 patients (range 26-30 days) and by all the menstruating female volunteers. Seven patients noted variation in constipation during the menstrual cycle, in all cases this comprised an improvement in symptoms just before or during menstruation. No consistent relationship between symptom severity and follicular or luteal phase was noted. Repeated orocaecal transit measurements in the four study groups showed no consistent differences (greater than 0.05) between groups or during the menstrual cycle (mean change weeks 1-4, -10 +/- 20 min). These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis of a progesterone related effect upon orocaecal transit in either normal or constipated women.\r"

  ".W": "A computerised system for measurement of vibration at the abdominal surface was constructed which was addressed to the evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) motor function. Preliminary studies revealed a dominant low frequency signal which was synchronous with the heartbeat and was considered representative of aortic pulsation. This was excluded by selective spectral filtration. The remaining signal was processed and measured by computer, with provision of quantitative energy values as well as of graphic display. The developed method, called surface vibration analysis (SVA) has been evaluated clinically; (a) against oral to caecal transit times (OCCT) of a standard solid meal, in five patients with severe postgastrectomy diarrhoea, seven patients with mild idiopathic diarrhoea and 22 healthy volunteers. (b) against prokinetic effects of a gastrointestinal stimulant (cisapride) in nine patients. In (a) postprandial SVA energy measurements were greater (SVA [*X (SEM)] = 406,933 (98,224] and oral to caecal transit of the solid meal was more rapid (OCTT = *90 (29) min) in the severe diarrhoea patients [postgastrectomy] than either the mild diarrhoea group (*SVA = 235,317 (50,780); *OCTT = *199 (42) min) or normal volunteers (*SVA = 212,062 (27,153); *OCTT = 242 (19) min) [p less than 0.01 for SVA and OCTT]. In the total group, an inverse correlation was observed between quantitative SVA energy values and oral to caecal transit times of solids (Spearman's rho = -0.486; p less than 0.01). In (b), drug stimulation of the GI tract caused an increase of fasting SVA measurements from *21,217 (5956) [before] to *41,937 (9606) [after] intravenous cisapride (p less than 0.05). This new technique may be useful for evaluation of gastrointestinal motor activity.\r"

Each volunteer was studied, basally, whilst continuously smoking, and while chewing nicotine gum. Neither liquid, nor solid oesophageal transit were affected by smoking, or gum. Liquid gastric emptying occurred exponentially and clearance was not affected by smoking nor gum (mean basal t1/2 17.4 (2.7) (SEM) min, smoking t1/2 16.6 (7.4) min, gum t1/2 12.5 (2.9) min). Gastric emptying of solid had three components. An initial mean lag phase increased from 17.5 (2.7) min, to 27.5 (6.1) min (p less than 0.05) during smoking, but was not prolonged by nicotine gum (17.5 (1.1) min). A subsequent linear emptying phase was also slowed by smoking from a mean of 1.01 (0.15)% min to 0.80 (0.15)% min (p less than 0.05), but was not affected by nicotine gum, 1.06 (0.2)% min. A third complex phase of solid gastric emptying was not analysed. Smoking delays gastric emptying of solids, but not liquids; nicotine is not responsible for this effect. This observation may partly explain the adverse effect of smoking in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

The contractile activity of the stomach and small bowel was studied in 20 patients (seven men) with nausea and vomiting for longer than six months. None had previous gastric surgery, mechanical obstruction and metabolic causes were excluded. Fasting (four hours) and fed (up to two hours) contractile activity was recorded by a low compliance infusion system from the gastric antrum (four sites), the duodenum and the jejunum. Normal criteria were established in seven healthy controls. During fasting, from one to three (median 2) migrating motor complexes (MMC's) were present in patients and controls. Only two patients had contractile abnormalities during fasting. After a solid-liquid test meal, the contractility of the gastric antrum (quantified electronically as a cumulative motility index for 60 minutes) was significantly impaired in patients (p = 0.012). Six patients had normal qualitative and quantitative antral activity but two of them had 'phrase III-like fasting activity' in the small bowel after the test meal. Postprandial antral hypomotility was identified as a major abnormality in patients with unexplained nausea and vomiting.\r"

All the patients had chronic atrophic gastritis in the body but Campylobacter like organisms were found at this site in only three patients. Thus the Type A pattern of gastritis (autoimmune) seen in patients with pernicious anaemia is only rarely associated with Campylobacter like organisms. Forty four of these patients had biopsies from body and antrum, 16 showed an antral gastritis of whom only one had Campylobacter like organism present. Twenty five of this latter group of patients were rebiopsied after five years. There was no change in the pattern of gastritis, and the same single patient remained colonised. The frequency of an antral gastritis in patients with pernicious anaemia was 36% yet the frequency of antral colonisation by Campylobacter like organisms was very low (6%). These results show that, as in the body, Campylobacter like organisms are not associated with gastritis when it occurs at this site in pernicious anaemia. The antral gastritis that may accompany body gastritis in pernicious anaemia seems more likely therefore to be an extension of primary type A body gastritis (autoimmune) rather than a secondary type B (chronic) gastritis and, it is argued, the antrum may exhibit resistance to colonisation.\r"

This technique permits enumeration of gliadin antibody secreting immunocytes, differentiated with regard to immunoglobulin class. Patients with coeliac disease were found to have high (834/10(6) cells) numbers of antigliadin spot forming cells (SFC) in gut mucosa. IgG and IgM antigliadin antibody secreting cells were infrequently shown whereas IgA antigliadin SFC predominated in all patients tested (average 68% of total SFC). Ten control patients were investigated in parallel with the coeliac patients and showed only low numbers of gliadin antibody secreting cells in gut mucosa (49/10(6) isolated cells). Antigliadin antibody secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was shown in only two of six coeliac patients tested and in none of the control patients. The findings suggest that the intestinal mucosa is a major site for antigliadin antibody production and that IgA is the dominating Ig-class of these antibodies. The high sensitivity and accuracy of the ELISPOT technique may provide a useful instrument for future studies of antibody production and regulation of the gut immune response to gluten and other alimentary antigens in coeliac and other intestinal diseases.\r"

Small intestinal biopsies taken before and two and a half hours after a gluten challenge in five patients with coeliac disease who had been maintained on a gluten free diet were examined by a combination of electron and light microscopy, organ culture, pulse chase biosynthetic labelling, SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Before the challenge, the small intestinal biopsies showed nearly normal morphology. Two and a half hours after the challenge there was deterioration in villus architecture, distortion of microvillus structure, disorganisation of the intermicrovillus pit region, an increase in lysosome like bodies in the apical cytoplasm of the luminal enterocytes and pronounced hypertrophy of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells. SDS-PAGE of small intestinal biopsies from four treated coeliac patients before gluten challenge revealed normal microvillus membrane and hydrolase composition. There was a generalised reduction but no specific alteration in the pattern of polypeptide synthesis in the mucosa of the small intestine in these subjects two and a half hours after the gluten challenge. These results suggest that the generalised reduction in small intestinal brush border enzymes in coeliac patients is not the primary pathogenetic mechanism and represents a secondary effect.\r"

The most critical period after a peritoneo-venous shunt is the early postoperative period when rapid mobilisation of peritoneal fluid occurs. Serial changes in the portal pressure during the early postoperative period have not been recorded. In the present study preoperative wedge hepatic vein (WHV), right atrial (RA) and pulmonary capillary wedged (PCW) pressures, cardiac index (CI), and plasma volume (PV) were measured in five alcoholic cirrhotic patients with tense ascites for up to 20 hours postoperatively. The longterm effect was assessed by repeating the intrahepatic and/or wedged hepatic vein pressures in three of the surviving patients after 10 to 20 months. A significant increase in the circulatory dynamics and portal pressure was seen within two hours after shunt placement. Wedged hepatic vein pressure increased from 27.6 (8.2) mmHg to 37.2 (9.2) mmHg (p less than 0.01), RA pressure increased from 6.8 (1.5) mmHg to 14.0 (4.3) mmHg (p less than 0.05), PCW increased from 7.2 (3.5) mmHg to 19.3 (5.7) mmHg (p less than 0.01), CI increased from 3.4 (0.27) lit/m2/min to 4.3 (0.85) lit/m2/min (p less than 0.05). This was accompanied by a 34% increase in the plasma volume from 1838.5 (142.1) to 2471.4 (210) ml/m2. These derangements were maintained up to 20 hours postoperatively. After 10 to 20 months, repeat measurements revealed a return to preoperative measurements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximum enrichment of bile with UCA (24 (SE) 4.9%) occurred with 15 mg UCA/kg/day. The maximum reduction in biliary cholesterol saturation was seen with the 10 mg/kg/day dose when the moles % cholesterol fell from 14 (2.4)% before treatment to 5.6 (0.83)% (p less than 0.02) and the saturation index fell from 1.4 (0.23) to 0.77 (0.13) (p less than 0.05). Clinical studies of the safety and efficacy of UCA in dissolving gall stones were carried out in 13 patients treated for up to two years with a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg/day. Diarrhoea caused withdrawal of treatment in three patients. There were no significant changes in liver function or haematology tests but fasting serum cholesterol tended to rise during treatment. Of nine patients treated for greater than 6 months, only one showed complete gall stone dissolution. As UCA may cause diarrhoea and hypercholesterolaemia, has only a modest effect on biliary cholesterol saturation and low gall stone dissolution efficacy, it is unlikely to replace existing forms of gall stone dissolution therapy.\r"

Recent studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor administration may cause liver injury and that tumor necrosis factor may mediate the lethality of the hepatotoxin galactosamine. One of the most potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor production is endotoxin. Because patients with alcoholic liver disease frequently have endotoxemia and because many of the clinical manifestations of alcoholic hepatitis are known biologic actions of tumor necrosis factor, we thought it would be important to evaluate tumor necrosis factor activity in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor release from peripheral blood monocytes, a major source of tumor necrosis factor production, was determined in 16 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 16 healthy volunteers. Eight of 16 alcoholic hepatitis patients and only two of 16 healthy volunteers had detectable spontaneous tumor necrosis factor activity (p less than 0.05). After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, mean monocyte tumor necrosis factor release from alcoholic hepatitis patients was significantly increased to over twice that of healthy controls (25.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 10.9 +/- 2.4 units per ml, p less than 0.005). We conclude that monocytes from alcoholic hepatitis patients have significantly increased spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor release compared to monocytes from healthy volunteers. We suggest that some of the metabolic abnormalities and possibly some of the liver injury of alcoholic hepatitis may be due to enhanced tumor necrosis factor production.\r"

The highest concentration of carbamoylphosphate synthetase (ammonia) is found in the parenchymal cells around the terminal portal venules. Glutamine synthetase is found in a small pericentral compartment two to three cells thick. In contrast to observations in rat liver, in human liver a well-recognizable intermediate zone can be distinguished in which neither enzyme can be detected. This intermediate zone is not yet established at the age of 8 years but can be recognized in livers from 25 years onward. Carbamoylphosphate synthetase can already be detected in the liver of human fetuses at 5 weeks of development. The enzyme distribution reveals a random heterogeneity among the hepatocytes, suggesting that not all hepatocytes start to accumulate carbamoylphosphate synthetase at the same time. From 9 weeks of development onward, the enzyme becomes homogeneously distributed throughout the liver parenchyma until at least 2 days after birth. Glutamine synthetase cannot be detected during this period. In addition, the definitive architecture of the acinus is not yet completed at birth. These results therefore support the idea that in human liver, metabolic zonation with respect to NH3 metabolism exists as it does in rat liver. Furthermore, the data show that this functional compartmentation becomes established concomitant with the development of the acinar architecture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, when these rats were also administered gadolinium chloride, which blocks Kupffer cell activity, most of the low-density lipoprotein-gold (but not gold complexed with albumin or polyvinylpyrrolidone) was taken up into hepatocytes by receptor-mediated endocytosis and concentrated in peribiliary lysosomes, as determined by electron microscopy. Colloidal gold taken up as a complex with low-density lipoprotein was excreted into the feces via the common bile duct at a maximal rate of about 5% daily, 4 to 12 days after injection. Thereafter, the rate of gold excretion fell off until reaching a plateau after 3 weeks. At this late time, most of the colloidal gold was shown by electron microscopy to be in Kupffer cells, whereas earlier (6 days after injection) it was contained mainly in older hepatocytic lysosomes, identified by lipofuscin granules. It is concluded that, in rats, hepatocytic lysosomes empty most of their contents into bile every week or two, apparently by exocytosis.\r"

  ".W": "A major factor in poor bioavailability of cyclosporine in children undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation appears to be poor absorption of the drug. Our hypothesis is that the Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy used for biliary drainage in these children causes cyclosporine malabsorption by reducing the length of bowel available for absorption and by distally displacing the entry of bile into the intestine. In these experiments, we determined the effect of biliary enteroenterostomy on the pharmacokinetics of enterally administered cyclosporine in Sprague-Dawley rats. Experimental rats (n = 24) were prepared for study by constructing self-emptying jejunal blind loops. Sham rats (n = 9) had jejunal transection and reanastomosis. Control rats (n = 26) had no operation. Two to 4 weeks later, chronic biliary-enteric fistulae were formed in all animals. In experiments, [3H]cyclosporine was delivered into the duodenum while the site of bile delivery varied. Hourly and cumulative [3H]cyclosporine excretion into bile was quantitated, which our preliminary data show to be a valid estimate of absorption. In control rats, bile was delivered into the duodenum or was replaced with saline and sucrose solution. In experimental rats, bile was infused either into the duodenum, which tested bowel shortening only, or into the proximal end of the blind loop, which tested the combined effects of bowel shortening and distal displacement of bile entry. In sham rats, bile was infused into the duodenum, which controlled for previous abdominal surgery, or into the midjejunum, which tested for distal bile entry only. Two effects of biliary enteroenterostomy on cyclosporine absorption were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the effects of different alpha-tocopherol concentrations on hepatic mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and oxidative metabolism in rats with chronic dietary iron overload. There was no evidence of mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes) or alteration in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in alpha-tocopherol-deficient rats with normal hepatic iron levels. Significant reductions in mitochondrial respiratory control ratios and oxidative phosphorylation ratios were seen in association with increased conjugated dienes in all three groups of iron-loaded rats regardless of the alpha-tocopherol status (deficient, normal or excess); thus, the alpha-tocopherol deficiency associated with dietary iron overload in this experimental model is not responsible for the mitochondrial abnormalities observed. In addition, chronic parenteral administration of alpha-tocopherol to iron-loaded animals, which increased hepatic levels of this substance 3-fold, did not ameliorate the hepatic mitochondrial lipid peroxidation or the defects in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism resulting from iron overload.\r"

  ".W": "The role of Kupffer cells during reparative regeneration of rat liver was investigated with an in vitro experimental model. Conditioned media from primary cultures of Kupffer cells isolated from intact and regenerating liver were added to primary cultures of hepatocytes, and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was studied. Kupffer cell-conditioned media from intact liver and regenerating remnant liver significantly stimulated DNA synthesis in hepatocytes as compared with control media (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the stimulating activity of Kupffer cells prepared from regenerating liver at 6 and 12 hr after partial hepatectomy was significantly higher than that of Kupffer cells from untreated rats (p less than 0.05). The activity was found in serum-free conditioned media. This stimulating activity exponentially increased as the increase of the number of the cultured cells, indicating that the stimulating activity was released directly by cultured Kupffer cells. These results suggest that Kupffer cells stimulate DNA synthesis in hepatocytes by producing and releasing certain factor(s) at an early stage of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.\r"

  ".W": "The availability of recombinant mitochondrial autoantigens may permit the experimental study of the pathophysiology of primary biliary cirrhosis. Previously, we demonstrated that high-titer antibodies to the 74 kD mitochondrial autoantigen dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase could be generated when BALB/c mice were immunized with purified recombinant protein. Based on these data, we attempted an 8-month study to induce antibodies and liver dysfunction by immunizing AKR/J, C3H/J and CBA/HeJ mice as well as rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and rhesus monkeys with purified recombinant human dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase. Antibodies to dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase were readily induced and detected in all species of experimental animals with species and strain differences in the titer of the responses. Of particular interest, rabbits and guinea pigs produced antibodies which were specifically reactive with the functional site of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, whereas the other strains and species produced antibodies to other epitopes on the molecule. Finally, similar to data on humans with primary biliary cirrhosis, the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme pathway was inhibited in the presence of immunized animal sera. These data imply that features other than simply an antibody response to mitochondrial enzymes are required for the development of primary biliary cirrhosis. Further studies will be necessary to determine the mechanisms by which mitochondrial proteins elicit an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "Since it has been suggested that propranolol could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, we undertook a study to assess the effects of propranolol on cerebral blood flow and cerebral functions. Sixteen patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices and without major hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score less than 14) or previous hepatic encephalopathy were randomized to receive either propranolol or placebo. The following measurements were performed before and 15 min after single intravenous administration of 15 mg propranolol or placebo and again 1 week after chronic oral administration of propranolol 160 mg per day or placebo: cerebral blood flow by the xenon-133 inhalation technique, quantitative electroencephalogram, psychometric test (number connection test), arterial ammonia, pH and pCO2, resting and exercise heart rates (after single administration, electroencephalogram, number connection test and biochemical measurements were not performed). Cerebral blood flow was not significantly modified by treatment (propranolol group: 80 +/- 23 vs. 76 +/- 11 and 83 +/- 9; placebo group: 73 +/- 10 vs. 75 +/- 11 and 81 +/- 18 ml per 100 gm per min, respectively, before and after single and repeated administration). Likewise, neither of the two treatments significantly altered number connection test, quantitative electroencephalogram index, arterial ammonia, pH and pCO2. We conclude that, in this population of cirrhotic patients, propranolol did not alter cerebral blood flow or neuropsychological functions. As a consequence, hemodynamic alterations cannot be considered as causes of possible cerebral side effects of propranolol in cirrhotic patients without severe hepatic dysfunction and previous hepatic encephalopathy.\r"

  ".W": "Using selective angiograms of the liver, we analyzed the patterns of intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinomas following curative surgery. In 33 patients with intrahepatic recurrences, seven patients (21%) had a recurrence near the resected hepatic stump. The remaining 26 had either a nodular recurrence in segments away from the resected margin or a widespread multinodular recurrence in the liver remnant. There was a recurrence within the first postoperative year in five of 16 patients with a nodular recurrence and in eight of 10 patients with a widespread multinodular recurrence. In these patients, particularly those with a widespread multinodular recurrence, tumor thrombi in the portal vein present before the operation and/or disseminated during operation from such an advanced main tumor seemed to be the most important and significant factor related to the early recurrence in the remnant liver. This evidence suggests that in cases of surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma it is important to establish a technique to prevent dissemination of cancer cells due to operative manipulation and also adequate adjuvant therapy rather than attempting to obtain an ample resection margin.\r"

  ".U": "89154335\r", 
  ".W": "During long-term studies of the natural history of woodchuck hepatitis virus infection, five cases of histologically confirmed, primary hepatocellular carcinoma were observed in a total of 92 woodchucks which had recovered, by analysis of viral serologic markers (WHsAg-, anti-WHc+, anti-WHs+), from experimental acute woodchuck hepatitis virus infections 20 to 30 months prior to the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. No hepatocellular carcinoma was observed in 167 uninfected controls at least 3 years of age and held in the same laboratory environment. Southern blot hybridization analysis of liver tissue taken from four of these recovered woodchucks revealed the presence of low levels (0.1 to 0.3 copies per cell) of integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (four of four animals) and nonneoplastic tissue (three of four animals). Similarly, hepatocellular carcinoma tissue obtained from two wild-caught, naturally infected and serologically recovered woodchucks also contained low levels of integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA. Liver tissues from another 27 of these 92 recovered woodchucks (without hepatocellular carcinoma) were examined for woodchuck hepatitis virus nucleic acids 13 to 31 months following experimental woodchuck hepatitis virus infection. Nonreplicating woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was present in the liver of eight (30%) and in the peripheral blood lymphocytes from eight (30%) of these 27 animals. These results were in marked contrast to the analysis of woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA in the liver tissue of chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus carriers (20 experimentally infected and nine naturally infected). In these animals, high levels of replicating woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA (up to 2,000 copies per cell) were observed in all hepatocellular carcinoma and nonneoplastic liver tissue. Integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was found in eight of 60 individual hepatocellular carcinomas detected in 29 chronic carriers, 15 to 40 months postinfection. Integrated woodchuck hepatitis virus DNA was present in the nonneoplastic tissue from four of these 29 chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus carriers.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms by which variations in blood ionized calcium (Ca2+) influence systemic arterial pressures independent of changes in extracellular fluid volume, pH, and electrolytes are unknown. To study this issue, we dialyzed eight stable hemodialysis patients on three separate occasions during 1 week with dialysates differing only in calcium concentration. Ultrafiltration was adjusted to achieve the patient's estimated dry weight. Postdialysis Ca2+ was measured, as were arterial blood gases, electrolytes, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hematocrit. Blood pressures and two-dimensional, targeted M-mode echocardiograms were recorded with the patient in the supine position after 15 minutes of rest. Postdialysis, three different levels of Ca2+ were achieved. Other measured biochemical variables and body weight did not differ among the three study periods. Changes in Ca2+ correlated directly with changes in systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures, left ventricular stroke volume, and cardiac output. In contrast, heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and total systemic vascular resistance were not altered significantly by changes in Ca2+. Thus, alterations in Ca2+ within the physiological range affect systemic blood pressure primarily through changes in left ventricular output rather than in peripheral vascular tone in stable dialysis patients.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of oral calcium loading, we studied the effect of low versus high calcium intake on salt-induced blood pressure elevations in patients with borderline hypertension. After a 7-day period of dietary salt restriction (50 meq/day), 27 patients were placed on a high salt (300 meq/day), low calcium (250 mg/day) diet for 7 days; 14 of these patients were given 2,160 mg/day of supplementary calcium (Ca group), and 13 patients were given placebo (non-Ca group). With a high salt intake, the percent increase in mean blood pressure was smaller in the Ca group than in the non-Ca group (+2.85 +/- 1.22% vs. +8.63 +/- 1.66%, respectively, p less than 0.01). The Ca group showed a smaller weight gain (p less than 0.05) and a greater urinary excretion of sodium (p less than 0.005) than the non-Ca group. In the Ca group, but not in the non-Ca group, high salt intake resulted in an increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium content (p less than 0.01), which was correlated inversely with the salt-induced changes in mean blood pressure (r = -0.54, p less than 0.05). While the increase in cellular magnesium was greater in the Ca group, the changes in red blood cell sodium and sodium/potassium ratio were not different between the two groups. The results suggest that oral calcium supplementation may prevent a rise in blood pressure in patients on a high salt, low calcium diet by attenuating the sodium retention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the effects of magnesium on high blood pressure, a 4-week study of oral magnesium supplementation (MgO 1 g/day) was conducted in 21 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. During the study, blood pressure and intraerythrocyte sodium concentration decreased significantly, and the erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 22Na efflux rate constant (Kos) and intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration both increased. Serum triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Furthermore, the elevation in Kos significantly and positively correlated with both the increase in intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and the decrease in mean blood pressure. There was a significant inverse correlation between the prestudy Kos and the decrease in mean blood pressure. In addition, when patients were divided according to their overall decrease in mean blood pressure, the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration was significantly higher in patients with a mean blood pressure decrease of more than 7 mm Hg than that of patients whose mean blood pressure decrease was less than 7 mm Hg. These results suggest that oral magnesium supplementation may lower blood pressure through the activation of a cell membrane sodium pump and may reduce serum lipid concentration. It also suggests that the lower the prestudy Kos or the higher the prestudy intraerythrocyte sodium concentration, the more effective the oral magnesium treatment is in lowering blood pressure. Therefore, we concluded that appropriate oral magnesium intake might be effective as a nonpharmacological treatment for essential hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities of calcium metabolism and of its two principal regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), have been reported in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Reports of abnormal calcitriol metabolism in the SHR by several groups have not provided measurements of tissue calcitriol receptors. Similarly, few data are available as to the parathyroid status of the SHR. In the present study, circulating calcitriol levels and intestinal and parathyroid gland calcitriol receptor status were determined in male SHR and in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Parathyroid status was investigated by determination of parathyroid gland mass together with tissue micromorphometry and by quantitative histology of bone as a measure of the biological action of parathyroid hormone. Circulating calcitriol levels were reduced in the 11-week-old SHR compared with the WKY rat (165 +/- 23 vs. 194 +/- 28 pmol/l, p less than 0.01, mean +/- SD). Calcitriol-free ratio was diminished and maximal specific binding capacity for calcitriol was increased in the SHR in parathyroid tissue (172 +/- 4.9 vs. 123 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.01) and in intestinal mucosa with no change of receptor affinity. Plasma ionized calcium (1.29 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.35 mmol/l, p less than 0.05) and phosphate (1.5 +/- 0.26 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.03 mmol/l, p less than 0.05) were significantly lower in the SHR. Parathyroid gland mass was increased in the SHR (59 +/- 12 vs. 17 +/- 7 micrograms/100 g body wt, p less than 0.001) as a result of hyperplasia and not hypertrophy. Higher osteoclast numbers were observed in SHR bone (27.6 +/- 0.79 vs. 23.9 +/- 0.66 osteoclasts/mm2, p less than 0.01), suggesting increased parathyroid hormone activity. In summary, in the 11-week-old SHR we observed reduced circulating calcitriol levels together with increased tissue calcitriol receptor numbers, increased parathyroid gland mass, and histological evidence of hyperparathyroidism. It is possible that these abnormalities influence the development of hypertension in the SHR.\r"

Dahl salt-sensitive (DS, n = 7), Dahl salt-resistant (DR, n = 7), and Sprague-Dawley (n = 6) rats were housed in metabolic cages and instrumented with a stainless steel cannula in the cisterna magna and a femoral arterial catheter. A blood sample was drawn daily (200 microliters), and cerebrospinal fluid was collected by continuous 24-hour withdrawal (200 microliters/day). Daily sodium, potassium, and water balances were also determined. Rats were studied sequentially on 0.4%, 4%, and 8% sodium diets (7 days per sodium level). Mean arterial pressure increased with 4% NaCl from 107 to 120 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) over 24 hours in DS rats and remained at about that level until the NaCl was increased to 8%, which resulted in a gradual rise of mean arterial pressure over the next 7 days to 135 mm Hg. Cerebrospinal fluid sodium was unchanged in DR and Sprague-Dawley rats fed 4% or 8% sodium, but in DS rats rose from 152.3 to 155.2 +/- 0.6 meq/l on the third day at 4% sodium and remained elevated over the next 2 weeks of study. Blood sodium was unchanged throughout the study in all groups. On the first day only of the 4% and 8% sodium diets, both DS and DR rats exhibited a similar net retention of sodium, which was greater than the Sprague-Dawley rats (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The synaptosomes of two rats, a SHR and a WKY rat control, were simultaneously processed and subjected to the same electrical field stimulation. The overflow of endogenous norepinephrine during electrical stimulation (2 Hz, 2 minutes) in the hypothalamic synaptosomes of 7-week-old SHR was significantly greater, whereas the overflow of 13-week-old SHR was equivalent to the age-matched WKY rat. The norepinephrine content of synaptosomes was about the same in SHR and age-matched controls. There was also significantly enhanced [3H]norepinephrine uptake in the hypothalamic synaptosomes of young SHR, but neither the hypothalamic nor the brainstem samples of 13-week-old SHR showed any significant difference in their rate of [3H]norepinephrine uptake. These data are similar to those we observed (unpublished observations) in perfused mesenteric artery system in which norepinephrine release was significantly elevated during periarterial nerve stimulation only in young SHR. Thus, these results suggest that a parallel enhancement of norepinephrine release in hypothalamus with that of peripheral nervous system may play an important role during development of hypertension in young SHR.\r"

  ".W": "Aortic rings isolated from normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats (CONT) exhibited spontaneous tone when the preparations were stretched. After administering deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA), the rats became hypertensive, and this spontaneous tone increased remarkably. The spontaneous tone was dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration. Incubation with the calcium entry blocker D-600 attenuated the spontaneous response to a greater degree in rings from DOCA rats than in rings from CONT rats. Nifedipine relaxed the already developed spontaneous tone. Removal of the endothelium greatly depressed spontaneous tone, but did not diminish the contraction caused by norepinephrine. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that 1) spontaneous tone depends on calcium influx, presumably through specific stretch-operated membrane channels, 2) these stretch-dependent channels are blocked by D-600 and nifedipine, 3) spontaneous tone is enhanced in DOCA hypertension, and 4) the endothelium appears to act as a receptor for stretch, mediating--at least in part--the spontaneous contractile response by releasing a constrictor agent.\r"

  ".U": "89154608\r", 
  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the mechanisms that contribute to the chronic hypotensive effects of verapamil during angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Hypertension was induced in five dogs by continuous intravenous infusion of angiotensin II (5 ng/kg/min) for 17 days. On the sixth day of angiotensin II infusion when daily sodium balance was achieved, mean arterial pressure (control, 92 +/- 4 mm Hg), plasma aldosterone concentration (control, 5.2 +/- 0.9 ng/dl), and renal resistance (control, 0.28 +/- 0.01 mm Hg/ml/min) were increased 37 +/- 8 mm Hg, 13.6 +/- 5.0 ng/dl, and 0.20 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml/min, respectively. At this time there were no significant changes in glomerular filtration rate, effective renal plasma flow, net sodium and water balance, or extracellular fluid volume. Subsequently, when verapamil was infused (at 2 micrograms/kg/min) simultaneously with angiotensin II (days 7-13), there was a net loss of 55 +/- 10 meq sodium, a 7.0 +/- 0.7% fall in extracellular fluid volume, and approximately a 70% reduction in the chronic effects of angiotensin II on mean arterial pressure and renal resistance; in contrast, verapamil failed to attenuate the long-term aldosterone response to angiotensin II. Further, although glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow tended to increase during verapamil administration, there were no consistent chronic long-term changes in these renal indexes. In comparison with these responses in hypertensive dogs, when verapamil was infused for 7 days before the induction of angiotensin II hypertension, there were no significant changes in any measurements except mean arterial pressure, which fell 11 +/- 1 mm Hg. Thus, these data fail to support the hypothesis that the chronic stimulatory actions of angiotensin II on aldosterone secretion are dependent on a sustained increase in transmembranal calcium influx. Moreover, these data indicate that the pronounced long-term hypotensive effects of verapamil in angiotensin II hypertension are due to impairment of the direct renal actions of angiotensin II rather than the indirect sodium-retaining effects that are mediated via aldosterone secretion.\r"

Twenty-six patients received hetastarch during the colloid phase of resuscitation and were compared to matched historical controls who received either albumin or fresh frozen plasma. Clinical and laboratory parameters were measured on admission and for 4 days after the burn. There was no significant difference in hemodynamics, respiratory status, incidence of bleeding, or renal or liver function among the three colloid groups. The advantages of hetastarch include immediate availability, no dependence on human blood donor population, no risk of serum-transmitted diseases, and lower cost. It can be safely recommended for those patients who object to blood products for resuscitation, in those situations where human donors are few, and when cost is a consideration.\r"

Investigations of burn shock have demonstrated the release of circulating factors that effect these fluid shifts. Previous studies have suggested that this process can be altered by the performance of plasma exchange in patients who fail to respond to conventional resuscitation. This study evaluated the effect of plasma exchange during burn shock. Twenty-two adult subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The control group received standard fluid resuscitation guided by the Parkland formula; the treatment group received the same resuscitation in addition to a course of plasma exchange. Seventeen subjects, eight from the control group and nine from the plasma exchange group, completed the study. Control subjects had a mean age of 37 years, a mean burn size of 52.3% total body surface area, and a mean full-thickness injury of 24.6% total body surface area. Plasma exchange patients had a mean age of 38 years, a mean burn size of 49.4% total body surface area, and a mean full-thickness injury of 37.3% total body surface area (p less than 0.01 compared to the control group). Completion of resuscitation was accomplished earlier in the plasma exchange group (20.2 hours versus 30.8 hours; p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the total amount of fluid required to achieve resuscitation. The mean urine output during resuscitation was greater for the plasma exchange group (p less than 0.01). Performance of plasma exchange during the second 8-hour period after the burn did not alter the course of burn shock in this study group.\r"

After injury, measurements were made 8 to 30 hours after smoke inhalation when respiratory distress was evident by arterial oxygen tensions of less than 60 mm Hg. Inhalation injury had little effect on cardiac output or blood flow to peripheral tissue. However, after inhalation injury airway blood flow (n = 6) was increased nine times in trachea, eight times in main stem bronchi, twelve times in intraparenchymal bronchi, and two times in whole lung. The increased airway blood flow resulted from a selective vasodilation of the airway vasculature because arterial driving pressures were unchanged by inhalation injury. Other investigators have shown that the microvascular permeability of the bronchial circulation is remarkably sensitive to inflammation, and the present experiments suggest that a selective vasodilation of the airway vasculature is another aspect of the airway response to inflammation. Increased airway blood flow through a leaky microvasculature may increase capillary filtrate from the bronchial circulation and contribute to the pulmonary edema of inhalation injury.\r"

The diagnostic characteristics of patients with an inhalation injury (N = 108) are listed; 7% of all patients (N = 52) have known smoke exposure with equivocal evidence for injury to the airway or pulmonary parenchyma. The degree of respiratory (visceral) failure experienced by patients with inhalation injury is not uniformly severe. Many of the clues to this diagnosis are indirect and not always related to the severity of pulmonary injury. Timing and degree of visceral failure control the severity of the injury, which increases progressively from that in patients with a burn only (parietal injury) through those with a visceral injury only (smoke without burn), those with both smoke and burn, to those with a burn and uniformly severe respiratory failure on the basis of sepsis.\r"

The maximal area treated was 28% total body surface area partial-thickness burn with application of 4.5 gm of lidocaine, resulting in a plasma level of 5.8 micrograms/ml. The plasma lidocaine level was constant during the 4-hour experiment and was associated with a significant decrease in pain. No infectious, allergic, or cardiovascular complications were observed.

This shortage is so significant that the American Medical Association (AMA) has proposed a new category of bedside care provider, a \"Registered Care Technologist\" (RCT). The purpose of this paper is to determine the magnitude of the registered nurse shortage in burn care facilities. A second purpose is to identify factors associated with high turnover rates and to document the reasons why registered burn nurses are leaving their positions.\r"

  ".U": "89155688\r", 
  ".W": "Pearl millet [Pennisetum millet (L.) leeke] is the main source of food energy for the rural poor in many areas of the semiarid tropics. Epidemiological evidence suggests that millet may play a role in the genesis of endemic goiter in these areas, and sparse experimental data in rats support this suspicion. This study was undertaken to determine in vivo in rats and in vitro using porcine thyroid slices and a thyroid peroxidase (TPO) assay the goitrogenic and antithyroid effects of millet diets, extracts of millet, and certain pure compounds contained therein. For use in these studies, whole grain millet was progressively dehulled to yield successively four bran and four flour fractions in which direct analyses revealed progressively lower concentrations of C-glycosylflavones. In vivo feeding of bran fraction 1, that richest in C-glycosylflavones, led to a significant increase in thyroid weight and antithyroid effects. Feeding of bran fraction 2, the next richest in C-glycosylflavones, produced similar, but less marked, changes. In vitro studies of 125I metabolism using porcine thyroid slices indicated that extracts of bran fractions 1 and 2 were most potent, producing changes similar to those produced by methimazole (MMI). At a concentration of 60 mumol/L, glucosylvitexin, the major C-glycosylflavone present in millet, had effects comparable to those of 1 mumol/L MMI. Similarly, in studies of porcine TPO, extracts of bran fraction 1 caused pronounced (85%) inhibition of enzyme activity, and progressively less inhibition was induced by extracts of bran fractions 2, 3, and 4. Overall, the TPO-inhibiting activities of the various millet fractions closely correlated with their C-glycosylflavone concentrations. Three C-glycosylflavones present concentrations. Three C-glycosylflavones present in millet, glucosylvitexin, glycosylorientin, and vitexin, also inhibited TPO activity. Thus, in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that millet diets rich in C-glycosylflavones produce goitrogenic and antithyroid effects similar to those of certain other antithyroid agents and small doses of MMI. We conclude that in areas of iodine deficiency in which millet is a major component of the diet, its ingestion may contribute to the genesis of endemic goiter.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the cortisol and melatonin circadian and ultradian rhythms in normal men using two approaches: 1) the men were exposed successively to two conditions, one normal and a second chosen to alter differently each of the hormones, i.e. complete bedrest for 34 h (supine, fasting, and under dim light), and 2) analyses of the rhythms using a combination of curve smoothing for the description of the 24-h rhythm, and peak detection and spectral analysis for the measurement of periodic phenomena. Blood was sampled every 30 min from 0700-0700 h. A diurnal rhythm was detected for both hormones, with different underlying frequencies. Plasma cortisol had an ultradian rhythm of 8 h. From 0000-0800 h (night) and 0830-1600 h (early day), the pulsatile activity and baseline values of cortisol were high, while from 1630-2400 h (late day), these variables were low. During complete bedrest, pulsatile activity and baseline values were even higher during the night period, and the nocturnal peak of cortisol, usually present between 0300-1000 h, was split in two, with an early peak at 0000-0400 h. There were two specific events during the day associated with synchronous, high amplitude pulses: awakening and eating at noon. No such pulses occurred at suppertime or when the men fasted. Melatonin secretion was organized around a 5.5-h period. In the rest condition, plasma melatonin values were higher during the night. The 24-h rhythms of cortisol and melatonin were temporally related. Plasma melatonin began to rise when plasma cortisol was at its lowest, it peaked when cortisol began to rise, and it began to decrease when cortisol reached its peak, with a 5-h phase delay between plasma cortisol and melatonin rise at night. In summary, melatonin and cortisol rhythms have different ultradian frequencies, suggesting an intrinsic difference in the mechanisms controlling their secretion. In addition, their responses to restricted physical activity in an environment with dim light were completely different; for plasma melatonin, the change was primarily quantitative, with an increase in total production especially at night, while for plasma cortisol, there was more of a qualitative change, with different patterns of pulsatile activity and possible splitting of the nocturnal peak. The differences in the ultradian organization of these two hormones imply that the correlation between their peaks must depend on a third factor, which is likely to be the 24-h organization of the day.\r"

In this study we investigated the relationship between TPO activity-inhibiting immunoglobulin (TPII) and thyroid function in 55 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and 35 untreated patients with Hashimoto's disease. TPO partially purified from the microsomal fraction of Graves' thyroid tissue by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration was incubated with immunoglobulin (Ig) fractions of serum prepared by precipitation with 15% polyethylene glycol. At the end of incubation, TPO activity was measured by a guaiacol assay. The TPII level was expressed as the TPII index, defined as the inhibition of TPO activity by patient Ig divided by inhibition produced by a known positive Ig. We also measured serum free T4, free T3, and TSH concentrations and anti-M-Ab titers, the latter by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When a positive TPII index was defined as more than the mean + 2 SD of the TPII index (0.38) for 15 normal subjects, 13 patients with Graves' disease and 14 patients with Hashimoto's disease had positive TPII index values. There was a positive correlation between the TPII index values and the M-Ab titers in patients with either Graves' disease (r = 0.38; P less than 0.01) or Hashimoto's disease (r = 0.52; P less than 0.01). The mean TPII index in patients with Hashimoto's disease was significantly higher than that in patients with Graves' disease [0.38 +/- 0.42 (+/- SD) vs. 0.19 +/- 0.41; P less than 0.05]. The slope of the regression line between the TPII index values and the M-Ab titers for patients with Hashimoto's disease was steeper than that for patients with Graves' disease. The mean serum free T4 concentration was significantly lower in those patients with Hashimoto's disease who had positive TPII index values than in those with negative TPII index values (14.0 +/- 5.0 vs. 9.6 +/- 3.7 pmol/L; P less than 0.01). There was no significant difference in thyroid function between the patients with Graves' disease with positive and negative TPII index values. TPII appears to inhibit thyroid function in some patients, but no simple relationship between TPII and thyroid function in autoimmune thyroid disease was demonstrated. Understanding the factors that control access of anti-TPO antibody to its antigen may help to elucidate the significance of circulating anti-TPO antibody.\r"

After the oral administration of [3H]equilin-[35S]sulfate, equilin sulfate containing both 3H and 35S was isolated from plasma; however, only in the first sample taken at 10 min was the 3H/35S ratio the same as that of the [3H]equilin-[35S]sulfate ingested. The 3H/35S ratio then increased, and by 12 h only traces of equilin-[35S]sulfate were detectable. Similarly, after the ingestion of [3H]equilin and equilin-[35S]sulfate, [3H]equilin-[35S]sulfate was isolated from plasma. The 3H/35S ratio was at all time points greater than the 3H/35S ratio of the ingested mixture. Analysis of urine indicated that over 98% of 35S was not associated with any steroid and was most likely inorganic sulfate. After iv administration of [3H] equilin sulfate to postmenopausal women, equilin, equilenin, 17 beta-dihydroequilin, and 17 beta-dihydroequilenin were isolated from the urine. These results indicate that 1) some of the orally administered equilin sulfate was absorbed from the gut without prior hydrolysis, 2) some equilin sulfate was hydrolyzed in the gut before absorption; 3) equilin was absorbed more efficiently than equilin sulfate; 4) equilin absorbed was readily sulfated and circulated in this form; and 5) equilin sulfate was extensively metabolized, and the metabolites were excreted in the urine mainly conjugated with glucuronic acid.\r"

In this study we used a highly purified, well characterized, large tryptic fragment of porcine TPO (hereafter referred to as purified porcine TPO) to examine possible differences among microsomal antibodies in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Antibodies against this TPO preparation and also against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 780-793 of the deduced sequence of the native enzyme were compared with microsomal antibodies from patients in immunoblot experiments. The antiporcine TPO and antisynthetic peptide antibodies reacted with crude preparations of human TPO. Binding of serum microsomal antibodies to purified porcine TPO was also found. Purified porcine TPO shows two fragments after gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions: a 59K fragment corresponding to the amino end of the molecule, and two approximately 30K fragments corresponding to the carboxyl end. Using an immunoblot procedure with purified porcine TPO as the antigen, we found that at least two epitopes were involved in microsomal antibody production: one associated with the 59K fragment and the other with the approximately 30K fragment(s). The distribution of serum antibodies against these epitopes differed among the patients, indicating that these antibodies comprise a heterogeneous group. Serum from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease significantly inhibited human TPO activity, raising the possibility that microsomal antibodies may contribute to the impaired thyroid function that occurs in some patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the diabetogenic effect(s) of thyroid hormones, we simultaneously measured glucose turnover in six hyperthyroid patients and six normal subjects. All had normal fasting blood glucose concentration and oral glucose tolerance test values. We determined hepatic total glucose output (HTGO) and total glucose phosphorylation with [2-3H]glucose and hepatic glucose production (HGP) and irreversible glucose uptake using [6-3H]glucose. The difference between the two turnover rates indicates the extent of hepatic glucose cycling (glucose in equilibrium glucose-6-phosphate). Measurements were made both in the postabsorptive steady state and during a 2-h glucose infusion (11.1 mumol/kg.min). The postabsorptive HTGO and total glucose phosphorylation were increased in the hyperthyroid patients [13.5 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) vs. 11.3 +/- 0.4 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.05]. HGP and irreversible glucose uptake also were slightly but not significantly higher. During the glucose infusion, HTGO and HGP were less suppressed in the hyperthyroid patients than in the normal subjects, while the increments in peripheral glucose uptake were normal. In hyperthyroidism, glucose cycling was increased both postabsorptively (2.35 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.17 +/- 0.25 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.025) and during glucose infusion (2.57 +/- 0.34 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.35 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.05). We conclude that increases in HTGO and HGP are important features of hyperthyroidism, especially during glucose infusion. The increase in GC indicates increased activities of both glucokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase. The diabetogenic effect of hyperthyroidism, as revealed most markedly by [2-3H]glucose, could be accounted for by augmented glucose production, possibly due to increased glucose-6-phosphatase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Three experimental protocols were devised to induce endometrial maturation in 12 women with ovarian failure. Each was planned to serve a dual purpose: to resolve a particular clinical situation related to synchronization between ovum donor and recipient and to answer a specific question about endometrial physiology. A fourth protocol of sequential estrace (2-6 mg/day) and progesterone (P4; 25-50 mg/day, im) simulating the 28-day natural cycle, served as a control protocol (18 cycles). A short follicular phase protocol consisted of only 6 days of estrogen (E) administration before addition of P4 (13 cycles). In the long follicular phase protocol (5 cycles), estrace was given for 3-5 weeks, and P4 administration was accordingly postponed. In 6 accelerated secretory transformation cycles, 150 mg/day P4 were administered, im, from day 15 onward. The adequacy of the induced endometrial cycles was evaluated by hormonal, morphological, and histochemical criteria relevant to endometrial normalcy and receptivity. Serum estradiol levels and the areas under the estradiol curves for the long and short follicular phase protocols differed significantly from those during the control cycles (P less than 0.005). Areas under the estradiol curves in the accelerated secretory transformation protocol yielded significantly higher P4 values than those in all other protocols (P less than 0.05). All biopsies in the 3 experimental protocols compared favorably with those of the control protocol. Glycocalyx intensity (periodic acid-Schiff) and the amount of galactose residues in the glycocalyx (Ricinus communis-I agglutinin) were greatest during the periimplantation interval. We conclude that a very short exposure of the human endometrium to E or, conversely, prolonged E stimulation will allow normal endometrial maturation with the addition of P4. Supraphysiological doses of P4 in the accelerated secretory transformation protocol significantly enhanced endometrial maturational processes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to develop an immunoradiometric assay for human neuropeptide (hNPY), a recently discovered and potent vasoconstrictor 36-amino-acid peptide, we used hNPY and some of its subpeptides to prepare monoclonal anti-NPY antibodies. Two monoclonal antibodies with high affinity for hNPY, that is affinity constants in the range of 10(10) mol/L-1, which respectively, reacted with the 9-18 portion and the 32-36 portion of hNPY were used in the immunoradiometric system. The assay was highly specific, NPY-related peptides such as pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY not being detected. The lower limit of sensitivity was 0.5 pmol/L. In 303 normal subjects, plasma NPY concentrations were less than 0.5 pmol/L in 67%, 0.5 to 5.0 pmol/L in 25% and 5.1 to 30 pmol/L in the remaining 8%. A value of 7.5 pmol/L (95th percentile value in the normal group) was considered as the upper limit of normal. Among 111 patients with various neuroendocrine tumors, elevated plasma NPY concentrations were found in patients with pheochromocytomas and neuroblastomas, the highest plasma levels being found in patients with malignant pheochromocytomas. We conclude that patients with neuroendocrine tumors, especially secreting and or malignant tumors of the sympathochromaffin system, often have elevated plasma NPY concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogens decrease serum total and ionized calcium (Ca) concentrations in postmenopausal women with or without primary hyperparathyroidism, but cause little or no increase in serum PTH suggesting a modification of the relationship between the two. In order to define this relationship, we studied the effect of conjugated estrogens on total and ionized serum Ca and serum PTH concentrations in five normal postmenopausal women, before and after 3, 11, and 23 weeks of therapy. Dynamic tests of parathyroid gland function, based on 2-h iv infusions of CaCl2 and NaEDTA, were performed at each time. Total and ionized serum Ca and carboxylterminal PTH were measured every 15 min during the infusions, and parathyroid function was evaluated by a nonlinear 4-parameter mathematical model. Estrogen therapy caused decreases in serum total [2.36 +/- 0.04 (SD) mmol/L, baseline vs. 2.19 +/- 0.05 mmol/L, 23 weeks, P less than 0.005) and ionized calcium (1.27 +/- 0.01 mmol/L, baseline vs. 1.21 +/- 0.02 mmol/L, 23 weeks, P less than 0.005]; the decreases were evident at 3 weeks and persisted for the duration of the study. Serum PTH concentrations did not change (8.94 +/- 1.84 pmol/L, baseline vs. 8.98 +/- 2.38 pmol/L, 23 weeks). Three parameters of the parathyroid function, the maximal response to hypocalcemic stimulation, the nonsuppressible fraction of circulating PTH, and the slope of PTH on calcium at the set point were not affected by estrogen treatment. The fourth parameter, the set point of PTH stimulation by serum total calcium (2.16 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, baseline vs. 1.97 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, 23 weeks, P less than 0.0166) or by serum ionized Ca (1.19 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, baseline vs. 1.12 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, 23 weeks, P less than 0.01), was decreased by estrogen treatment. This was evident at the earliest time point studied and persisted thereafter. The decrease in ionized Ca set point only explained 40% of the decrease in total calcium set point, the remaining 60% being related to hemodilution of plasma protein during therapy. We conclude that estrogen replacement can influence parathyroid function in postmenopausal women by resetting the set point of PTH stimulation by ionized Ca. This in turn could contribute to the estrogen-induced changes in their Ca balance.\r"

  ".U": "89155708\r", 
  ".W": "Exogenous administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK) is known to decrease food intake and slow gastric emptying in humans and animals. Recent studies have shown that CCK stimulates neurohypophyseal secretion of oxytocin (OT) in rats and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in monkeys, and that gastric distention also stimulates OT release in rats. We therefore studied AVP and OT secretion in 14 normal subjects in response to meal-induced gastric distention and administration of CCK, both separately and in combination, to assess whether these stimuli similarly activated central neurohypophyseal pathways in humans. Neither plasma AVP nor OT concentrations increased after gastric distention produced by ingestion of a large meal. However, a dose-related increase in plasma AVP, but not OT levels, occurred after CCK administration, the threshold CCK dose being 0.05 micrograms/kg body weight. The AVP secretion in response to CCK administration was significantly correlated with subjective aversive symptoms quantified by use of a numeric scale (r = 0.61, P less than 0.001). In 12 of the 14 subjects plasma AVP levels increased in association with symptoms of epigastric pressure and discomfort before the onset of overt nausea or emesis. The combination of CCK and meal-induced gastric distention did not stimulate increases in plasma AVP levels in excess of those produced by CCK administration alone. The results demonstrate that AVP secretion resulting from emetic center activation often is a graded response that can begin in association with milder degrees of visceral discomfort before symptoms of overt nausea or emesis. In addition, the stimulation of AVP secretion by CCK administration, but not by meal-induced gastric distention in association with physiological satiety, suggests that some component of the anorectic effects of exogenous CCK in man likely results from activation of brainstem emetic centers.\r"

To test in vivo octreotide (SMS 201-995) responsiveness, the patients were given a single dose (100 micrograms, sc) and their plasma GH levels were measured for several hours. Somatostatin receptor content was measured by receptor autoradiography on frozen tumor tissue sections using either a somatostatin-28 analog or a SRIH octapeptide analog (Tyr3-octreotide) as iodinated radioligands. In eight acromegalic patients, who had complete and long lasting GH inhibition after octreotide administration, SRIH receptors with high affinity for octreotide were distributed homogeneously in the tumor tissue. Two patients had moderate, short duration, and incomplete inhibition of GH secretion after octreotide administration, and their tumors had very low capacity and/or affinity SRIH receptors. A further patient who had a moderate response to octreotide had SRIH receptors that were nonhomogeneously distributed throughout the tumor. These data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of octreotide may be related to tumor SRIH receptor levels; the best in vivo responses to octreotide occurred in patients whose tumors contained a high density of homogeneously distributed receptors which had a high affinity for octreotide.\r"

A feeder layer was required for outgrowth of psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes of involved skin, but not for that of cells of uninvolved skin. The growth of normal epidermal keratinocytes was inhibited by 1,25-(OH)2D3, and the number of DNA-synthesizing cells, determined in autoradiographs, was reduced to about 15% of that in control cultures by 1 nmol/L 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0.4 ng/mL). Epidermal keratinocytes isolated from both involved and uninvolved skin of patients with psoriasis were resistant, and 100-fold more 1,25-(OH)2D3 was required to inhibit their DNA synthesis.

This report describes a patient with Cushing's syndrome and feminization due to ACTH-independent bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. A 47-yr-old black man presented with Cushingoid features, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, impotence, and gynecomastia. Urinary cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion were 94 nmol/mmol creatinine (normal, less than 32) and 5.8 mumol/mmol creatinine (normal, 0.6-3.6), respectively. Both decreased by less than 30% after administration of dexamethasone (8 and 16 mg/day), and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion did not increase after metyrapone (750 mg, orally, every 4 h for six doses). Plasma ACTH was undetectable (less than 1 pmol/L) and was not stimulated by administration of metyrapone or ovine CRH. Serum testosterone was 5.2 nmol/L (normal, 7-30), FSH was 5 U/L (normal, 3-18), LH was 2.8 U/L (normal, 1.5-9.2), and estrone was 767 pmol/L (normal, 55-240). Both adrenal glands were enlarged, with a total weight of 86 g (normal, 8-10), and contained multiple nodules (diameter, greater than 0.5 cm) composed of two active cell types, one of which was also observed between the nodules. Cushing's syndrome with feminization due to ACTH-independent bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia is an unusual process of unknown etiology that should be included with the other known causes of Cushing's syndrome.\r"

RNA from the epsilon, gamma, beta, zeta, theta, and alpha globin genes were present in fetal liver samples isolated from 10-25-wk embryos. The abundance of all human globin mRNAs declined in older fetuses, presumably because of a gradual reduction in the proportion of erythroid precursors in the liver as development proceeds. The gamma:beta globin mRNA ratio in 10-18-wk fetal erythroblasts was 6-7:1, and in adult erythroid bone marrow the ratio was 0.02:1. In fetal liver samples, the relative abundance of epsilon transcripts was less than 1% that of gamma, and zeta transcripts less than 5% that of alpha. Embryonic transcripts declined in abundance during late fetal development and were not detected in newborn liver or adult erythroid bone marrow. theta globin mRNA also represented a minor species (less than 1% that of alpha) in fetal liver samples, but in contrast to the embryonic mRNAs, was most abundant in adult marrow samples obtained from patients with erythroid hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that globin protein levels are regulated by the relative amounts of each globin mRNA at various stages of erythropoietic development.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis was tested that the field of a premature (S2) stimulus, interacting with relatively refractory tissue, can create unidirectional block and reentry in the absence of nonuniform dispersion of recovery. Simultaneous recordings from a small region of normal right ventricular (RV) myocardium were made from 117 to 120 transmural or epicardial electrodes in 14 dogs. S1 pacing from a row of electrodes on one side of the mapped area generated parallel activation isochrones followed by uniform parallel isorecovery lines. Cathodal S2 shocks of 25 to 250 V lasting 3 ms were delivered from a mesh electrode along one side of the mapped area to scan the recovery period, creating isogradient electric field lines perpendicular to the isorecovery lines. Circus reentry was created following S2 stimulation; initial conduction was distant from the S2 site and spread towards more refractory tissue. Reentry was clockwise for right S1 (near the septum) with top S2 (near the pulmonary valve) and for left S1 with bottom S2; and counterclockwise for right S1 with bottom S2 and left S1 with top S2. The center of the reentrant circuit for all S2 voltages and coupling intervals occurred at potential gradients of 5.1 +/- 0.6 V/cm (mean +/- standard deviation) and at preshock intervals 1 +/- 3 ms longer than refractory periods determined locally for a 2 mA stimulus. Thus, when S2 field strengths and tissue refractoriness are uniformally dispersed at an angle to each other, circus reentry occurs around a \"critical point\" where an S2 field of approximately 5 V/cm intersects tissue approximately at the end of its refractory period.\r"

Whole plasma calcitonin (iCT) basal levels, metabolic clearance rate (MCR), and production rate (PR) of CT were measured in 9 premenopausal and 16 postmenopausal women, including 11 osteoporotics (OP). Basal iCT levels were statistically lower in postmenopausal women than in the premenopausal group (P less than 0.01) and strongly correlated (r = 0.72; P less than 0.001) with estrone circulating levels (E1). MCR were similar in all groups. PR were similar in eugonadal women between 22 (mean +/- SD = 30.9 +/- 9.9 micrograms/d) and 37 yr (mean +/- SD = 25.5 +/- 11.1 micrograms/d) premenopausal women. In healthy postmenopausal women PR were reduced, but not significantly (mean +/- SD = 19.5 +/- 6.95 micrograms/d), whereas osteoporotic patients presented a highly significant reduction of CT PR (mean +/- SD = 9.8 +/- 4 micrograms/d) (P less than 0.01). Because there is a strong relationship between E1 and PR (r = 0.64; P less than 0.001), CT secretory capacity appears to be modulated by estrogen circulating levels. This modulation leads to a menopause-related decrease in iCT. In osteoporotics, an independent impairment of CT production drastically lowers PR and basal iCT levels. CT might be one of the determining factors in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

  ".U": "89155790\r", 
  ".W": "During pressure-load hypertrophy of the adult heart in vivo, there is up-regulation of the mRNA encoding skeletal alpha-actin, the sarcomeric actin iso-mRNA characteristic of mature skeletal muscle and the fetal/neonatal heart. We have shown previously that during alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-stimulated hypertrophy of cultured rat heart myocytes, the induction of skeletal alpha-actin mRNA is greater than that of the mRNA encoding cardiac alpha-actin, the sarcomeric actin iso-mRNA characteristic of the adult heart. To determine if this actin iso-mRNA switch during cardiac hypertrophy reflects changes in the transcriptional status of the myocyte nucleus, we quantified the rate of transcription of actin mRNAs and total RNA, using an in vitro run-on transcription assay with nuclei isolated from the cultured myocytes after stimulation with norepinephrine (NE). Transcription of skeletal alpha-actin was increased at 3 h after NE, reached a maximum 6.1-fold increase at 12 h, and returned to the control level at 24 h. The EC50 for NE was 200 nM, and pharmacologic studies indicated alpha 1-receptor specificity. Transcription of cardiac alpha-actin was also increased rapidly by NE (maximum 4.6-fold vs. control at 3 h). However, cardiac alpha-actin transcription had returned to the control level at 6 h, when NE-stimulated skeletal alpha-actin transcription was still increasing. Transcription of the cytoskeletal (beta) actin gene was not changed significantly by NE treatment. Total RNA transcription was not increased until 6 h after NE (1.5-fold vs. control) and remained elevated through 24 h. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not attenuate NE-stimulated actin gene transcription. Thus the alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediates a rapid, transient, and selective increase in transcription of the sarcomeric actin isogenes during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Skeletal alpha-actin, the fetal/neonatal isogene, is induced preferentially to cardiac alpha-actin, the adult isogene. The different kinetics of actin isogene and total RNA transcription and the independence of transcription from protein synthesis suggest that transcriptional induction via the alpha 1 receptor is complex and may involve preexisting regulatory factors. These results are the first to demonstrate that the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor is a molecular mediator of transcriptional changes underlying an isogene switch that is known to be associated with cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.\r"

We have studied the soluble fraction that is required for NADPH oxidase activation in a cell-free system. Human neutrophils were separated in a membrane-containing and a soluble fraction. The soluble fraction was separated on carboxymethyl (CM) Sepharose in 10 mM 4-morpholino-ethanesulfonic acid buffer of pH 6.8. Reconstitution of the NADPH oxidase activity, measured as O2 consumption, was only found when the membrane fraction was combined with the flowthrough of the CM Sepharose column as well as with a fraction that eluted at 125 mM NaCl. This result indicates that at least two soluble components are necessary for reconstitution of the NADPH oxidase activity: one that does not bind to CM Sepharose and one that does bind. These components were designated soluble oxidase component (SOC) I and SOC II, respectively. Boiling destroyed the activity in both fractions. In the soluble fraction of human lymphocytes and thrombocytes neither SOC I nor SOC II activity was found. SOC II copurified with a 47-kD phosphoprotein, previously found defective in patients with the autosomal form of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Inactive soluble fractions of cells from autosomal CGD patients were reconstituted with a SOC II fraction from control cells. The result of this experiment indicates that autosomal CGD patients are normal in SOC I but defective in SOC II.\r"

  ".W": "The production and growth regulatory activity of transforming growth factor beta were studied in human thyroid tissue. As estimated by its mRNA expression in fresh tissue samples, transforming growth factor beta was produced in normal and in diseased thyroid glands. Transforming growth factor beta mRNA was mainly produced by thyroid follicular cells and in lesser quantities by thyroid infiltrating mononuclear cells. The concentrations of transforming growth factor beta mRNA were lower in iodine-deficient nontoxic goiter than in Graves' disease and normal thyroid tissue. Transforming growth factor beta protein secretion by cultured thyroid follicular cells was also low in nontoxic goiter, but could be increased by addition of sodium iodide (10 microM) to the culture medium. Recombinant transforming growth factor beta did not affect basal tritiated thymidine incorporation in cultured thyroid follicular cells, but inhibited, at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, the growth stimulatory influence of insulin-like growth factor I, epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, TSH, and partly that of normal human serum on cultured thyroid follicular cells. This inhibition was greater in Graves' disease than in nontoxic goiter. These results suggest that transforming growth factor beta may act as an autocrine growth inhibitor on thyroid follicular cells. Decreased transforming growth factor beta production and decreased responsiveness to transforming growth factor beta may be cofactors in the pathogenesis of iodine-deficient nontoxic goiter.\r"

  ".W": "Peroxisomal function was evaluated in a male infant with clinical features of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. Very long chain fatty acid levels were elevated in both plasma and fibroblasts, and beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids in cultured fibroblasts was significantly impaired. Although the level of the bile acid intermediate trihydroxycoprostanoic acid was slightly elevated in plasma, phytanic acid and L-pipecolic acid levels were normal, as was plasmalogen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts. The latter three parameters distinguish this case from classical neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy. In addition, electron microscopy and catalase subcellular distribution studies revealed that, in contrast to neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, peroxisomes were present in the patient's tissues. Immunoblot studies of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes revealed that the bifunctional enzyme (enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) was deficient in postmortem liver samples, whereas acyl-CoA oxidase and the mature form of beta-ketothiolase were present. Density gradient centrifugation of fibroblast homogenates confirmed that intact peroxisomes were present. Immunoblots of fibroblasts peroxisomal fractions showed that they contained acyl-CoA oxidase and beta-ketothiolase, but bifunctional enzyme was not detected. Northern analysis, however, revealed that mRNA coding for the bifunctional enzyme was present in the patient's fibroblasts. These results indicate that the primary biochemical defect in this patient is a deficiency of peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme. It is of interest that the phenotype of this patient resembled neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and would not have been distinguished from this disorder by clinical study alone.\r"

Right ventricular papillary muscles were removed from young adult (9 mo) and old (24-26 mo) male Fischer 344 rats that were chronically exercised on a rodent treadmill and from their age-matched, nonexercised controls. During isometric contraction, hypoxia depressed contraction and relaxation in all muscles, but to a lesser extent in the exercised groups. A significant exercise effect was observed in the following variables: the maximum developed tension, the maximum rate of tension development, the maximum rate of tension decline, and the time required for the hypoxia to reduce maximum tension by 20%. The maximum rate of tension decline was more sensitive to hypoxia than was the maximum rate of tension development in all groups. Exercise also had an effect on the temperature dependence of cardiac performance during hypoxia. Thus, chronic exercise results in the preservation of both contraction and relaxation during hypoxia for aged as well as young adult hearts.\r"

In this study the expression of 10 different genes, encoding the subunit polypeptides for collagen types I-VI, by human skin fibroblasts in culture was analyzed by molecular hybridizations. Northern transfer analysis demonstrated the presence of specific mRNA transcripts for collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VI, but not for type II collagen. Quantitation of the abundance of these mRNAs by slot blot hybridizations revealed that type I, III, and VI procollagens were the major collagenous gene products of skin fibroblasts in culture. The mRNAs for type IV and V collagens represented only a small percentage of the total collagenous mRNA transcripts. Further analysis by in situ hybridization demonstrated that the majority of the cultured cells coexpressed the genes for type I, III, and VI procollagen pro-alpha chains. Further in situ hybridization analyses revealed the expression of type VI collagen genes in normal human skin. These data demonstrate that human skin fibroblast cultures can be used to study the transcriptional regulation of at least nine genetically distinct procollagen genes. The data further suggest that type VI collagen, in addition to types I and III, may be a major collagenous component of human skin.\r"

Studies demonstrated that our patient's monoclonal IgG antibody interacted with apoprotein B-100. The LDL-antibody complex isolated from our patient did not affect the degradation of LDL by human fibroblasts, indicating that while IgG derived from our patient interacted with LDL it did not alter the metabolism of this lipoprotein by the LDL receptor pathway. Since the LDL receptor pathway is the major route of LDL metabolism, this probably explains why our patient was not hyperlipidemic. In contrast to an absence of effect on the LDL receptor, our patient's LDL-antibody complex stimulated cholesterol esterification within macrophages indicating the uptake and degradation of the LDL-antibody complex. The LDL-antibody complex inhibited the degradation of acetyl LDL by macrophages (scavenger pathway), demonstrating that our patient's LDL-antibody complex was recognized as a modified LDL. Moreover, mixing Ig from our patient with normal LDL also resulted in the normal LDL increasing the esterification of cholesterol by macrophages. One can hypothesize that our patient's monoclonal IgG-LDL complex interacted with the macrophage scavenger receptor, thereby resulting in the occurrence of xanthoma in the absence of hyperlipidemia.\r"

As a first approach to assessing the role of TNF alpha in the skin, we evaluated the binding and biological effects of TNF alpha on human neonatal foreskin keratinocytes maintained in culture. We found that TNF alpha at 0.3-1.0 nM inhibited proliferation of keratinocytes in a reversible fashion as demonstrated by a reduction in total DNA content and clonal growth. The antiproliferative effects were most marked when TNF alpha was added in the preconfluent stages of cell growth. Accompanying this antiproliferative effect was a stimulation by TNF alpha of differentiation of keratinocytes as indicated by the stimulation of cornified envelope formation. Keratinocytes specifically bound TNF alpha, reaching maximal binding in 2 h at 34 degrees C or 8 h at 4 degrees C. Much of the apparent binding at 34 degrees C was due to internalization of the TNF alpha. At 4 degrees C the rate of internalization was much less. Confluent keratinocytes showed a single class of high-affinity receptors with 1,250 receptors/cell and a Kd of 0.28 nM. These data suggest a role for TNF alpha in the growth and differentiation of the epidermis.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanisms responsible for abnormalities in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth and vasoreactivity are not defined. Because Na+/H+ exchange, which we have previously demonstrated in cultured VSMC, plays an essential role in mediating growth factor responses, we hypothesized that abnormalities in SHR growth regulation might be reflected in the activity of this transporter. To test this hypothesis, we studied DNA synthesis and Na+/H+ exchange (measured as the rate of amiloride-sensitive intracellular alkalinization or Na+ influx) in early subcultures (less than 6) of aortic VSMC from 12-wk-old SHR and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) animals. Serum-deprived SHR VSMC grew more rapidly in response to 10% serum with an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation of 439% compared with 191% in WKY controls. Basal intracellular pH (pHi) values determined by fluorescent pH measurements were 7.37 +/- 0.04 and 7.27 +/- 0.03 (P less than 0.05) in early passage SHR and WKY, respectively. Acid recovery (initial pHi = 6.8) by SHR VSMC was faster than by WKY VSMC as measured by alkalinization (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.2 mmol H+/liter.min, P less than 0.05) or by amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx (14.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.0 +/- 0.5 nmol Na+/mg protein.min, P less than 0.05). In comparison to WKY cells early passage SHR VSMC exhibited 2.5-fold greater alkalinization and amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx in response to 100 nM angiotensin II. During serial passage, WKY cells acquired enhanced Na+/H+ exchange and growth rates so that by passage 6, these differences were no longer present. These findings in early cultures of SHR VSMC, removed from the in vivo neurohumoral milieu, suggest that increased Na+/H+ exchange in SHR may reflect alterations in Na+ homeostasis that might contribute to altered SHR VSMC function such as enhanced growth and vasoreactivity.\r"

In normal colons mucosal tetraethylammonium (TEA; 30 mM) or barium (Ba; 5 mM), but not cesium (Cs; 15 mM), reduced Jsm without affecting Jms. In aldosterone animals (a) net K secretion (-0.54 +/- 0.11) was converted to net K absorption (0.63 +/- 0.15) by mucosal TEA, which produced a marked reduction in Jsm (0.82 +/- 0.07) and an increase in Jms (0.35 +/- 0.07). In contrast mucosal Ba resulted in a relatively smaller reduction in JK(sm) without altering JK(ms), whereas mucosal Cs was ineffective; (b) serosal bumetanide or the removal of serosal Na or Cl markedly inhibited JK(sm and abolished net K secretion; and (c) serosal ouabain (1 mM) produced qualitatively similar effects to those of serosal bumetanide. These results demonstrate that (a) normal rat distal colon contains apical TEA- and Ba-sensitive K channels; (b) aldosterone induces TEA-sensitive and Ba-sensitive apical K channels; (c) aldosterone-induced K secretion requires both the Na,K-pump and Na-K-2Cl cotransport for K uptake across the basolateral membrane; and (d) alteration of any of these processes results in inhibition of aldosterone-induced active K secretion simultaneously with stimulation of K absorption.\r"

Patients become responsive to Leishmania antigen in both in vivo and in vitro assays after successful antimony therapy. The cell type involved in the suppression of lymphocyte reactivity to Leishmania antigen was studied by selective depletion of mononuclear cell (MNC) populations and in co-cultivation experiments. Adherent cells were depleted on plastic and by passage on nylon wool columns. High-avidity Fc+ cells were depleted by adherence to BSA-anti-BSA complexes and OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells were depleted by treatment with monoclonal antibody (anti-OKT4+ and OKT8+) and complement. Depletion of MNC preparations of adherent cells, high-avidity Fc+ cells, OKT4+ cells and OKT8+ cells failed to restore the lymphocyte reactivity to Leishmania antigen. Antimony therapy was associated with restoration of the proliferative responses of unseparated MNC (before treatment 460 +/- 76 cpm and after treatment 4,293 +/- 1,442 cpm). Co-culture of frozen cells obtained before chemotherapy with autologous MNC obtained after treatment reduced the response of posttreatment cells to Leishmania antigen by 80%. We conclude that the antigenic specific suppression of lymphocyte proliferation in visceral leishmaniasis is cell mediated.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanisms governing the normal resolution processes of inflammation are poorly understood, yet their elucidation may lead to a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. The removal of neutrophils and their potentially histotoxic contents is one prerequisite of resolution. Engulfment by macrophages is an important disposal route, and changes in the senescent neutrophil that are associated with their recognition by macrophages are the subject of this investigation. Over 24 h in culture an increasing proportion of human neutrophils from peripheral blood or acutely inflamed joints underwent morphological changes characteristic of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Time-related chromatin cleavage in an internucleosomal pattern indicative of the endogenous endonuclease activation associated with programmed cell death was also demonstrated. A close correlation was observed between the increasing properties of apoptosis in neutrophils and the degree of macrophage recognition of the aging neutrophil population, and a direct relationship between these parameters was confirmed within aged neutrophil populations separated by counterflow centrifugation into fractions with varying proportions of apoptosis. Macrophages from acutely inflamed joints preferentially ingested apoptotic neutrophils and histological evidence was presented for occurrence of the process in situ. Programmed cell death is a phenomenon of widespread biological importance and has not previously been described in a cell of the myeloid line. Because it leads to recognition of intact senescent neutrophils that have not necessarily disgorged their granule contents, these processes may represent a mechanism for the removal of neutrophils during inflammation that also serves to limit the degree of tissue injury.\r"

  ".U": "89155811\r", 
  ".W": "Recent findings from this laboratory suggest that the biological actions of placental lactogen (PL) in mammalian fetal tissues are mediated through binding of the hormone to a distinct and unique PL receptor. We have now purified this receptor from fetal and maternal sheep liver, characterized its binding to PL, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL), and determined its molecular weight by SDS-PAGE and by affinity cross-linking techniques. Soluble extracts containing specific, high-affinity (Kd 0.5 nM) PL binding activity were prepared by incubating ovine fetal and maternal liver microsomes with 1% Triton X-100. The detergent solubilized PL receptor was purified two- to threefold by ion-exchange chromatography and an additional twofold by gel exclusion chromatography on Sepharose 6B. The PL receptor was then purified 75,000- to 125,000-fold by affinity chromatography using a column of ovine PL (oPL) coupled to Affi-Gel 10. The molecular weight of the oPL receptor as determined by SDS-PAGE and by cross-linking techniques was 44,000 +/- 2,000 (range 40,000-48,000). The purified receptor bound 125I-oPL specifically and with high affinity (Kd 0.5 nM) but did not bind either radiolabeled ovine GH or ovine PRL. In addition, in competition studies using 125I-oPL as the radioligand, the purified PL receptor bound unlabeled oPL with a potency 30-50 times greater than that of ovine GH and 500-1,000 times greater than that of ovine PRL. These findings demonstrate the presence of a specific PL receptor in fetal and maternal sheep liver. The PL receptor, together with the GH and PRL receptors, constitute a family of distinct but related hormone receptors that differ in their relative affinities for PL, GH, and PRL. Changes in the expression of the three receptors may mediate changes in the hormonal control of growth during the transition from fetal to postnatal life.\r"

To investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in this adaptation, cell and luminal pH were measured microfluorometrically using (2\",7')-bis(carboxyethyl)-(5,6)-carboxyfluorescein in isolated, microperfused S2 proximal convoluted tubules from control and acidotic rabbits. Chronic respiratory acidosis was induced by exposure to 10% CO2 for 52-56 h. Tubules from acidotic rabbits had a significantly lower luminal pH after 1-mm perfused length (7.03 +/- 0.09 vs. 7.26 +/- 0.06 in controls, perfusion rate = 10 nl/min). Chronic respiratory acidosis increased the initial rate of cell acidification (dpHi/dt) in response to luminal sodium removal by 63% and in response to lowering luminal pH (7.4-6.8) by 69%. Chronic respiratory acidosis also increased dpHi/dt in response to peritubular sodium removal by 63% and in response to lowering peritubular pH by 73%. In conclusion, chronic respiratory acidosis induces a parallel increase in the rates of the luminal Na/H antiporter and the basolateral Na/(HCO3)3 cotransporter. Therefore, the enhanced proximal tubule reabsorption of bicarbonate in chronic respiratory acidosis may be, at least in part, mediated by a parallel adaptation of these transporters.\r"

  ".W": "Hypoxia in isolated myocytes results in accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines (LCA) in sarcolemma. Inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT-I) with sodium 2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-pentyl]-oxirane-2-carboxylate (POCA) prevents both the accumulation of LCA in the sarcolemma and the initial electrophysiologic derangements associated with hypoxia. Another amphiphilic metabolite, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), accumulates in the ischemic heart in vivo, in part because of inhibition of its catabolism by accumulating LCA. It induces electrophysiologic alterations in vitro analogous to early changes induced by ischemia in vivo. The present study was performed to determine whether POCA could prevent accumulation of both LCA and LPC induced by ischemia in vivo and if so, whether attenuation of early arrhythmogenesis would result. LAD coronary artery occlusions were induced for 5 min in chloralose-anesthetized cats. Coronary occlusion in untreated control animals elicited prompt, threefold increases of LCA (73 +/- 8 to 286 +/- 60 pmol/mg protein) and twofold increase of LPC (3.3 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.9 nmol/mg protein) selectively in the ischemic zone, associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurring within the 5-min interval before acquisition of myocardial samples in 64% of the animals. POCA prevented the increase of both LCA and LPC. It also prevented the early occurrence of VT or VF (within 5 min of occlusion) in all animals studied. The antiarrhythmic effect of POCA was not attributable to favorable hemodynamic changes or to changes in myocardial perfusion measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Thus, inhibition of CAT-I effectively reduced the incidence of lethal arrhythmias induced early after the onset of ischemia. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of this enzyme provides a promising approach for prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death, that typically occurs very soon after the onset of acute ischemia, in man.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of acetazolamide on Na+-HCO3- cotransport in basolateral membrane vesicles isolated from the rabbit renal cortex. Na+ uptake stimulated by an imposed inward HCO3- gradient was not significantly reduced by 1.2 mM acetazolamide, indicating that acetazolamide does not directly inhibit Na+-HCO3- cotransport. 4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS)-sensitive Na+-base cotransport was found to be absolutely CO2/HCO3--dependent. We therefore tested whether acetazolamide-sensitive availability of HCO3- at the basolateral membrane could be rate-limiting for Na+-base cotransport under some conditions. In the presence of a CO2/HCO3- buffer system but absence of an initial HCO3- gradient, Na+ influx was stimulated fivefold by an outward NH4+ gradient. This stimulation of Na+ influx by an outward NH4+ gradient was inhibited greater than 75% by 0.6 mM acetazolamide, suggesting that acetazolamide blocked the ability of the NH4+ gradient to generate an inward HCO3- gradient. In the presence of an inward HCO3- gradient, Na+ influx was inhibited greater than 70% by an inward NH4+ gradient. This inhibition of Na+ influx was reduced to only 35% by 0.6 mM acetazolamide, suggesting that acetazolamide blocked the ability of NH4+ to collapse the inward HCO3- gradient. Similarly, Na+ influx in the presence of an inward HCO3- gradient was inhibited greater than 80% by an outward acetate gradient, and this inhibition was reduced to only 50% by acetazolamide. Thus, acetazolamide caused either inhibition or stimulation of Na+ uptake depending on the conditions with respect to pH and HCO3- gradients. The indirect interaction of acetazolamide with the basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- cotransport system may be an important mechanism underlying inhibition of proximal tubule acid secretion by this agent.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed the effect of functional fascicular block (FFB) on ventriculoatrial conduction time (VACT) during orthodromic tachycardia (OT) in 32 patients with single accessory pathway (AP) of the Kent bundle type. The location of AP was left free wall (LFW-AP) in 21 patients, left posteroseptal in 6, right free wall in 2, and right anteroseptal in 3. FFB either alone or in combination with functional left or right bundle branch block (LBBB or RBBB) occurred predominantly at the onset of OT and was initiated with ventricular extrastimulus technique more often than with atrial extrastimulation. In patients with LFW-AP, isolated functional left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) produced significant prolongation in VACT (15-35 ms). A similar magnitude of VACT increase (20-35 ms) was also observed when LAFB was associated with RBBB. Although 25-45-ms prolongation in VACT occurred with functional LBBB and normal axis, an additional 20-55-ms VACT increase was seen when LAFB accompanied LBBB. Functional LAFB, alone or in combination with bundle branch block, however, did not prolong VACT in patients with other AP locations. Furthermore, left posterior fascicular block did not produce prolongation of VACT in any of the cases. It is concluded that in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, evaluation of VACT during functional LAFB provides important information regarding AP localization and a clear separation of LFW-AP from all other locations.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the effects of chronic cyclosporine (CsA) administration on the determinants of nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) using micropuncture techniques (mp) in male Munich-Wistar rats. Animals received CsA (30 mg/kg SQ) in olive oil daily for 8 d before mp. Controls (PFC) were pair fed. SNGFR, glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient (delta P), nephron plasma flow (SNPF), plasma protein oncotic pressure (pi A), and glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (LpA) were quantitated in each experiment. CsA was associated with a lower SNGFR due to decreases in SNPF and a major reduction in delta P but no decrease in LpA. Plasma volume expansion (PVE) caused SNGFR, delta P, and SNPF to increase in both CsA and PFC without eliminating the differences between CsA and PFC. CsA/PVE rats responded normally to angiotensin II (AII) infusion indicating that the low delta P associated with CsA is not due to unresponsiveness to AII. Prior renal denervation caused SNGFR and SNPF to increase in CsA-treated animals but failed to alter the reduction in glomerular capillary pressure after CsA or to eliminate the glomerular hemodynamic differences between treated animals and pair-fed controls. This constellation of glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities suggests that the renal effect of short-term chronic CsA administration is mediated primarily by a reduction in the afferent effective filtration pressure resulting from an imbalance between pre- and postglomerular vascular resistances.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombospondin is a 420-kD platelet alpha-granule glycoprotein that binds specifically to heparin. We examined adhesion to thrombospondin of CHO K1 cells and three mutant CHO lines with varying deficiencies in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis. In an experiment in which the parent line (K1) had 78% adherence to thrombospondin adsorbed to tissue culture plastic, CHO S745 cells, with less than 6% normal GAG synthesis had 11% adherence. CHO S677 cells, with decreased heparan sulfate proteoglycan but increased chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, had 42% adherence. CHO S803 cells, with decreased heparan sulfate proteoglycan and normal chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, had 31% adherence. Heparin inhibited K1 cell adhesion to thrombospondin, but not fibronectin, in a concentration-dependent manner. Dermatan sulfate but not chondroitin sulfate was also inhibitory. There was markedly decreased K1 cell adhesion to a thrombospondin core fragment that lacked the heparin binding NH2-terminal domain. Purified heparin binding domain, although poorly adhesive when adsorbed to substratum, inhibited cell adhesion to intact thrombospondin. Adhesion was better for all cell lines tested, including three human tumor cell lines, when thrombospondin was adsorbed at pH 4.0 compared with pH 7.4. When adsorption of thrombospondin was done at pH 7.4, cell adhesion was better when thrombospondin was adsorbed in the presence of greater than or equal to 0.6 mM calcium, compared to 0.1 mM calcium or EDTA. These findings suggest that thrombospondin can adsorb to plastic with varying degrees of exposure of a cell adhesion domain. We conclude that the thrombospondin cell adhesion receptor on CHO cells is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and that cell adhesion to thrombospondin depends on conformation of adsorbed thrombospondin.\r"

This was due almost exclusively to an increase in the certainty of the diagnosis of circulatory disease. Unfortunately, this was not justified as the numbers of false positive and false negative diagnoses were high in both years. With this increased certainty came a lack of interest in the necropsy. Similar lack of interest was also shown by surgeons in 1984, though in this instance it was accompanied by a high level of agreement between their diagnoses and necropsy findings.\r"
