Administration of a vasodilatator agent such as the prostaglandin E1 analogue Rioprostil (Bayer AG, BAY 06893) might prevent preglomerular vasoconstriction and hence reduce cyclosporin nephrotoxicity. As an increased excretion of urinary enzymes as a consequence of CyA-nephrotoxicity is well known we investigated in 40 male Wistar rats the excretion of three urinary enzymes: the brush border enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG). Additionally we determined s-creatinine and CyA plasma level. The kidneys were studied histologically at the end of the study. Wistar rats receiving 20 or 50 mg CyA/kg/d showed a marked deterioration in renal function and an increase of all urinary enzymes determined. In the rats receiving 20 mg CyA/kg/d and Rioprostil (150 micrograms/d) renal function and the enzymes determined remained in the normal range. There was no change in the enzyme excretion and only a minor improvement of renal function in rats receiving 50 mg CyA/kg/d and Rioprostil. Histological findings showed prevention of CyA nephrotoxicity in the 20 mg/kg/d group and diminished renal damage in the 50 mg/kg/d group.\r"

In nine patients who had significant collateral circulation to the infarct-related coronary artery (group A), there was significant improvement in both the left ventricular ejection fraction (53% to 60%, p less than 0.05) and regional wall motion in the infarct zone (8% to 18%, p less than 0.01 in the anterolateral area) with administration of nitroglycerin. In contrast, in the remaining 10 patients without significant collateral perfusion (group B), there were no detectable changes in either global function (49% versus 50%) or regional wall motion (6% versus 8% in the anterolateral area) before and after nitroglycerin. Changes in heart rate and left ventricular peak systolic and end-diastolic pressures with nitroglycerin were comparable in both groups. These results suggest that angiographically demonstrable collaterals preserve viable myocardium, which can improve its contraction when the supply-demand relationship is favorably affected because of increased collateral flow and/or more favorable loading conditions produced by nitroglycerin.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the possible contribution of coronary artery spasm to the pathogenesis of angina pectoris, coronary arterial responses to intracoronary injection of acetylcholine were examined in patients with various types of angina pectoris. Coronary artery spasm with chest pain and/or electrocardiographic ischemic changes was angiographically demonstrated in 50 (85%) of 59 patients with angina pectoris. The sensitivity for coronary spasm was 92% (24 of 26) in patients with rest angina, 100% (16 of 16) in patients with both rest and effort angina, and 59% (10 of 17) in patients with effort angina, while it was only 6% (1 of 16) in patients without coronary artery disease. When patients with effort angina were subdivided according to the variability of anginal threshold for exertional angina, the sensitivity for coronary spasm was as high as 90% (9 out of 10) in patients with variable-threshold angina. In contrast, coronary spasm was less frequently (p less than 0.05) induced in patients with fixed-threshold angina (1 of 7, 14%). These results suggest that coronary arteries in patients with angina pectoris are quite susceptible to acetylcholine except in those patients with stable exercise tolerance or anginal threshold. Thus coronary artery spasm appears to play a significant role for the pathogenesis of angina pectoris in a large proportion of patients with effort angina as well as in patients with rest angina.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the expression and distribution of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the ventricles of 27 autopsied children with Kawasaki disease. Fourteen of the children had died in the acute stage of the disease. Three without any coronary artery aneurysms died due to myocarditis, while 11 with coronary artery aneurysms also had myocarditis but died of coronary heart disease. Histologic evidence of acute myocardial infarction was noted in three children who died of coronary heart disease. In the 14 children with acute-stage deaths, no abnormal expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was noted in the ventricles, despite the presence of heart failure in seven of them for 2 to 22 days before death. The other 13 patients had coronary artery aneurysms and died in the healed stage. In three patients with granulation tissue and congestive heart failure, myocytes in foci around the granulations were moderate to markedly positive for atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These three patients died over 8 days after the onset of their first myocardial infarct. Of 10 patients with old myocardial infarction, four had a history of congestive heart failure. They demonstrated moderate or marked atrial natriuretic polypeptide expression in extensive regions around sites of massive fibrosis, and foci of slight expression in the inner third of the noninfarcted region of the ventricle. In the other six patients without congestive heart failure, there was slight or moderate expression in foci around sites of massive fibrosis. We concluded that the expression of atrial natriuretic polypeptide appeared more than 1 week after the onset of acute myocardial infarction in the ventricles of children with Kawasaki disease who died in the healed stage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a 72-hour infusion of nitroglycerin produces hemodynamic improvement in patients with severe congestive heart failure and to assess the contributing role of various possible causes of hemodynamic tolerance to nitroglycerin, 19 patients received an infusion of nitroglycerin 1.5 micrograms/kg/min for 72 hours. In a subgroup of patients (n = 10), there was an increase in stroke work index and a decrease in ventricular filling pressures throughout the infusion and even after it was discontinued. Tolerance to the hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin was partially reversed 8 hours after the infusion was stopped. Neurohumoral changes occurred but appeared to play only a minor role in the development of nitroglycerin tolerance. However, hematocrit fell 9 +/- 5%, which suggests that an increased intravascular volume contributed to tolerance. In summary: (1) a 72-hour infusion of nitroglycerin improves ventricular function in some patients with severe heart failure; (2) volume shifts from the extravascular to the intravascular compartments may, at least in part, be responsible for nitroglycerin tolerance; and (3) reflex neurohumoral activation may also play a small role in nitrate tolerance.\r"

Studies have shown that exercise tolerance time does not improve with continuous nitroglycerin regimens, although the frequency of anginal attacks may decrease. Intermittent therapy, which incorporates a nitrate-free interval, improves both exercise time and clinical angina. The optimal duration of the nitrate-free interval has yet to be determined. Future research is likely to focus more on supply-side factors in angina. Of the available antianginal drugs, nitrates have been shown to be highly effective coronary vasodilators, particularly in areas of stenosis.\r"

Our conceptualization of the ischemic process is still incomplete, and the question of whether to treat silent ischemia remains. Ultimately, the decision will depend on demonstrable benefit for prognosis. Every acute ischemic syndrome is indicative of poor prognosis, independent of other factors associated with adverse outcome and of the method of measurement. The true determinant of the need to treat is the total ischemic pattern, and how silent ischemia and angina fit within that context is not yet known.\r"

The prevalence of polyps, cancer, and angiodysplasia, and the colonoscopy success rate were obtained from consecutive colonoscopy records. Costs were estimated from hospital charges; sensitivity and specificity of barium enema and colonoscopy were obtained from the literature. For treatable lesions (cancer, polyps, and angiodysplasia), the colonoscopy first strategy had a higher sensitivity (80% vs. 57%) and a higher specificity (95% vs. 80%) than the barium enema first strategy. Cost effectiveness measures were similar for the two strategies. Colonoscopy as the first diagnostic test had a lower cost per treatable lesion ($2,319 vs. $2,895) and a lower cost per neoplasm detected ($2,694 vs. $2,896), whereas the barium enema first strategy had a lower cost per cancer detected ($10,050 vs. $10,297). The lower cost per treatable lesion of the colonoscopy first strategy was not affected by changes in the prevalence of lesions, test characteristics, costs of tests, or colonoscopy success rate over clinically relevant ranges. The higher cost of colonoscopy was offset by its greater sensitivity and its capacity for biopsy and therapy. Therefore, since the cost per treatable lesion is lower and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value is superior, colonoscopy is recommended as the preferred initial test in evaluating a patient with fecal occult blood loss.\r"

  ".W": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) used to supply enteral nutrition has supplanted surgically placed feeding tubes in many institutions. These tubes are currently placed in: 1) patients with reversible disease with potential for recovery (stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome); 2) patients with incurable disease with potential for extended survival (head and neck cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis); or 3) patients who are terminal or seriously debilitated (head trauma, systemic malignancies). Few data are currently available regarding long-term survival, survival difference between various patient populations, and incidence of recovery of oral intake with subsequent PEG tube removal. In this study, records of 191 patients in whom PEG tubes were placed were retrospectively reviewed and information collected regarding underlying diseases (malignant vs nonmalignant), survival, and incidence of subsequent tube removal. Of the patients, 68 (36%) had cancer, and 123 (64%) had benign disease (usually stroke or other neurologic disorder). Survival curve analysis demonstrated that one-third of patients were dead within 60 days of PEG placement, and half were dead in the first 6 months. Total deaths were 115 (60%) at a median time of 164 days. No mortality was directly related to acute or subsequent PEG tube complications. Feeding tubes were removed in 41 patients (21%), 10 with cancer (5%), and 31 without (16%, p less than 0.05). These data on limited patient survival and low incidence of recovery of oral intake suggest that facilitation of hospital discharge into a less expensive home care or step-down facility is the most likely goal to be realized after PEG placement. Further, these results raise questions regarding the appropriateness of PEG placement in patients with anticipated early mortality or low likelihood of hospital discharge.\r"

The Fick principle was applied during hepatic vein catheterization. Arterial ANF concentration in patients with cirrhosis [11.1 +/- 1.6 (SEM) pmol/L] was not significantly different from that of the control subjects (14.9 +/- 4.2 pmol/L, NS). Arteriohepatic venous extraction ratio of ANF (0.43 +/- 0.05 in cirrhosis vs 0.37 +/- 0.09 in controls, NS), hepatic-intestinal clearance (274 +/- 46 vs 237 +/- 46 ml/min, NS) and removal rate (2.9 +/- 0.88 vs 3.1 +/- 0.77 pmol/min, NS) were closely similar in patients and controls. The present results give no indication that significantly reduced hepatic-intestinal disposal of ANF has a role in causing altered circulating plasma levels of this peptide in cirrhosis. This is in keeping with the presence of vascular clearance receptors and peptidases for ANF degradation independent of hepatocellular function.\r"

Benznidazole-treated rabbits had their survival time shortened, probably as a consequence of Chagas' heart disease and of the development of lymphomas. The survival time of untreated T. cruzi-infected rabbits was 765 +/- 639 days and those treated with Benznidazole in the chronic phase of infection survived for 392 +/- 571 days. Malignant, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were present in 38% of the rabbits that received the nitroarene therapy. Testicular atrophy was observed in 2 out of 10 nitroarene-treated rabbits.

Patients were evaluated clinically, serologically, and parasitologically. Allopurinol was found to be as efficacious as the conventional therapeutic modalities in eliminating the parasitemia and rendering patients seronegative. Adverse reactions occurred in 11% of patients who received allopurinol and in 30% of those receiving nitrofurans. Reactions with the conventional therapy were more frequent and of a more serious nature. Oral allopurinol is as effective as the nitrofurans, but has none of the side effects.\r"

Pregnancies were documented by formation of vaginal plugs, and daily records were kept concerning the status of the pregnancies, delivery, and offspring. One hundred thirty-two pregnancies in uninfected mice resulted in 101 (77%) viable litters. In contrast, 133 pregnancies in mice infected with S. mansoni lead to 45 (34%) viable litters. The decreased number of viable litters born or raised by infected mothers resulted from maternal death during pregnancy (5%), spontaneous abortion (20%), and infanticide (42%). Observations of multiparous infected mice indicated that this reduced rate of production of viable, surviving offspring was not different in subsequent pregnancies nor influenced by the duration of the infection. At 2 weeks of age, offspring of infected mice weighed significantly less than offspring of equal-sized litters from uninfected mice, but this weight differential was not sustained beyond 2 weeks of age. Subsequent studies compared the effects on uninfected pregnant mice of injections of antibodies against S. mansoni soluble egg antigens (immunoaffinity-purified from sera of mice with 16 week S. mansoni infections) vs. normal mouse immunoglobulin. After repeated injections of these antibodies during multiple pregnancies, lowered reproductive efficiencies (37%) were observed as compared to parallel studies of pregnant mice injected with normal mouse immunoglobulin (67%).\r"

In group III (6 rats), (E)-3-[4-(1-imidazolylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoic acid hydrochloride monohydrate (OKY 046), which is a highly selective TxA2 synthetase inhibitor, was administered at the rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min for ten minutes. The hypotension caused by PGI2 administration was accompanied by arteriolar constriction, although it disappeared with the increase in the systemic blood pressure five minutes after administration of PGI2 was stopped. The systemic blood pressure and the internal diameter of arterioles showed no change in the OKY 046 and in the control group. The vasoconstrictive response to NE was inhibited by PGI2 and OKY 046 for thirty to forty-five minutes and the inhibitory effects were similar in both cases. These results show that PGI2 and a selective Tx synthetase inhibitor, OKY 046, attenuate the vascular response to NE.\r"

These are often related to noncardiac causes including esophageal, musculoskeletal, and hyperventilatory or panic states. However, recently a subgroup of such patients are being recognized as having true myocardial ischemia and chest pain on the basis of diminished coronary microvascular vasodilatory reserve (microvascular ischemia or Syndrome X). The authors describe such a patient who was found to have replication of anginal pain associated with a reversible ischemic defect on thallium 201 imaging during atrial pacing, suggesting ischemia in this myocardial segment. Resolution of angina and ST segment electrocardiographic changes of ischemia occurred with cessation of pacing. We believe this is the first report of a patient with this form of myocardial ischemia diagnosed by this method and should be considered in patients with anginal chest pain after significant coronary artery disease and coronary vasospasm have been excluded.\r"

The New Jersey DRG reimbursement system, an all-payer system, failed to provide adequate financial compensation overall, as the average loss per patient (operating cost minus reimbursement) was $508. Lost potential revenue (hospital charges minus reimbursement) was even greater, averaging $1,834 per patient. We conclude that the New Jersey DRG reimbursement system, in its current form, provides inadequate reimbursement for the system, in its current form, provides inadequate reimbursement for the proper workup and treatment of trauma patients with minor injuries. Because these patients are those most likely to help \"subsidize\" the care of sicker patients, changes in the system are necessary to allow hospitals to continue to provide state-of-the-art trauma care and to continue to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to trauma.\r"

Two samples of blood (\"first aspirate\" and \"second aspirate\") were then aspirated from the IV catheter while one sample was obtained by venipuncture from the opposite arm (control). All three samples were then analyzed for CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose. Catheter aspiration succeeded in 30 of 38 attempts (79%). Three samples were hemolyzed, and five samples were unable to be fully aspirated.

From a bacillary positive (smear and/or culture positive) case rate of 80/100,000, there were 282 patients from whom Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured. Each isolate was packaged and delivered to Canada where speciation and drug susceptibility testing were performed. Reported resistances are those using the proportions method (Laboratory Center for Disease Control, Ottawa, Canada). Resistance to one or more drugs was found in 22% of isolates. Age was the most important predictor of resistance in Haiti; resistance rates for age groups less than 14, 14 to 29, 30 to 44, greater than or equal to 45 were 8, 19, 22, and 31%, respectively. In patients not known to have received antituberculous drugs in the past, resistances were isoniazid (19%), streptomycin (5%), ethambutol (2%), ethionamide (2%), rifampin (1%). We conclude that antituberculous drug resistance is prevalent in Haiti, especially in older age groups, and that in persons with no known antituberculous drug use in the past, resistance to isoniazid is significant.\r"

Twenty patients (24%) were found to have BAL collagenase activity on initial evaluation (collagenase-positive group). Compared with patients without BAL collagenase (collagenase-negative group), the collagenase-positive group had (1) a higher proportion of BAL suppressor T cells (p less than 0.03); (2) a lower helper-suppressor T-cell ratio (p less than 0.002); (3) lower mean percent predicted FEV1, FVC, and DLCO levels (p less than 0.05); and (4) a higher proportion of patients with advanced (Stage 4) disease on chest roentgenogram (p less than 0.001). Significant differences were also observed between the collagenase-positive and collagenase-negative groups during follow-up. A higher proportion (55%, n = 11) of collagenase-positive patients required corticosteroid therapy than did collagenase-negative patients (26%; n = 17; p less than 0.025). Of those who remained untreated, pulmonary function tended to decrease in the collagenase-positive group, whereas mean pulmonary function levels actually improved in the collagenase negative group (p less than 0.05). Of those who required therapy, mean percent predicted FVC and DLCO levels improved significantly after treatment in the collagenase-negative group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively), whereas an improvement in percent predicted FVC levels only (p less than 0.01) was observed in the collagenase-positive group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Hyperoxia is routinely administered to patients with severe emphysema. To gain insight into the possibly adverse effects of such treatment, hamsters were exposed to 60% oxygen for 5 days, beginning 48 h after induction of pulmonary emphysema by intratracheal instillment of pancreatic elastase. Control groups consisted of (1) animals instilled with elastase and exposed to room air, (2) animals instilled with saline and exposed to 60% oxygen, and (3) animals instilled with saline and exposed to room air. Cross-linked elastin content and synthesis in the lung were measured immediately following termination of hyperoxia, and the mean linear intercept was determined 4 wk later. Cytologic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids was also performed. Statistical significance was determined by a two-way analysis of variance. Results indicate that exposure to 60% oxygen significantly affected (p less than 0.05) air-space size, causing a 51% increase among elastase-treated hamsters (124 versus 82 microns) but only a 4% increment among saline-treated animals (52 versus 50 microns). When compared to other groups, animals treated with both elastase and hyperoxia had a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) percentage of neutrophils (28%) in their lung lavage fluids immediately following exposure to 60% oxygen. Although total lung elastin content was not altered by hyperoxia at this time, labelling of elastin cross-links was significantly increased (p less than 0.05). These studies demonstrate that exposure to 60% oxygen enhances elastase-induced lung injury. They also raise the possibility that oxygen therapy may, under certain circumstances, accelerate the progression of human emphysema.\r"

  ".U": "90358466\r", 
  ".W": "Eosinophil infiltration into bronchoalveolar areas of the lung has been assessed in guinea pigs sensitized to ovalbumin (OA) and then challenged with the aerosolized antigen. Cell content, histamine, and guinea pig albumin (GPA) have been measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from these animals. Extensive eosinophil accumulation resulted from sensitization followed by OA challenge; monocytes that initially accounted for greater than 80% of the BAL cells remained essentially constant, and neutrophils comprised less than 3% of the population throughout. Eosinophils were elevated at 3 h, peaked with a fivefold increase at 24 h, and remained elevated for at least 7 days. Histopathologic changes observed in lungs taken from sensitized guinea pigs 24 h after OA challenge confirm this eosinophilia. Increased histamine and GPA were detected only at 5 min. Oral treatment with betamethasone (ED50 = 0.4 mg/kg), phenidone (ED50 = 15 mg/kg), Sch 37224 (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg), and WEB 2086 (ED50 = 4 mg/kg) decreased eosinophil accumulation in the BAL fluid, indicating roles for 5-lipoxygenase products and PAF in this multimediator-dependent model of allergic inflammation. On the other hand, 4 mg/kg of indomethacin increased total cells with no effect on eosinophils, precluding a major role for cyclooxygenase products. Sch 37224, an antileukotriene agent and an orally active novel antiallergy agent in sheep, guinea pigs, and humans, is as potent as betamethasone at blocking eosinophil infiltration, suggesting that it may also suppress human pulmonary inflammation.\r"

The 6 patients had received a mean weekly MTX dose of 9.6 mg (range 5-15) for a mean of 61.7 months (range 58-64), and none received concomitant corticosteroids. Total generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in neutrophils stimulated ex vivo with 10 microM calcium ionophore A23187 for 20 minutes was significantly suppressed, by a mean of 53%, after the MTX dose compared with the predose levels (mean +/- SEM 13.0 +/- 1.4 ng/10(6) cells versus 6.0 +/- 0.9 ng/10(6) cells; P = 0.0019), reflecting a comparable suppression of both released and cell-retained LTB4. A 49% decrease in omega-oxidation products of LTB4 demonstrates that decreased LTB4 synthesis, rather than increased degradation, is responsible for the decrease in LTB4 generation. The absence of a significant change in either 3H-labeled arachidonic acid release or platelet-activating factor generation indicates that the observed decrease in LTB4 synthesis was apparently not caused by diminished phospholipase A2 activity. A 28% decrease in the total formation of the 5-lipoxygenase products 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and the 6-trans-LTB4 diastereoisomers, and a 48% suppression of production of LTB4 plus its omega-oxidation metabolites after the MTX dose suggest inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase activity and possible suppression of leukotriene A4 epoxide hydrolase activity.\r"

Data obtained demonstrated that IFN-gamma-expressing T lymphocytes, mostly CD8+ cells, were present in HIV-1-infected patients, and that their percentage, always higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in healthy subjects (p less than or equal to 0.001), increased with progressive stages of HIV-1 infection. At the same time other markers of T-cell activation, namely interleukin-2 receptor (rIL-2), transferrin receptor, and HLA-DR were also found to be positive in some of the HIV-1-infected subjects. The presence in the HIV-1-infected patients of activated CD8+ T cells, which are resistant to HIV-1 infection, may suggest that these cells are able to respond to continuous and progressive viral expression (HIV or/and other viruses) and may be a component of the specific response to HIV-1.\r"

We investigated and compared the presence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antigens in parotid saliva and serum by Western blotting in 22 HIV-1-infected individuals. Antibodies to the HIV-1 envelope antigen gp160 were detected in saliva samples from 21 of 22 individuals and in serum from all individuals who were classified as CDC Group II, III, or IV. Antibody titers to gp160 were approximately 3000 times higher in serum than in saliva. Antibodies to viral core antigen p24 were detected in 6 of 7 Group II individuals in saliva and in 7 of 7 in serum. Antibodies to p24 were not found in the parotid saliva, but were detected in the sera of 3 of 3 Group III and 11 of 12 Group IV patients. The absence of secretory antibodies to HIV-1 core antigen p24 was correlated with CD4+ cell counts of less than 200/mm3. The results suggest that loss of secretory anti-p24 antibodies may be an early sign of progression to higher CDC clinical stages in HIV-1-infected individuals.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether left atrial size--a likely indicator of atrial stretching--correlates with the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide and whether this relation is different in patients in sinus rhythm and in those with atrial fibrillation. Arterial plasma concentrations of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (ir-ANP), adrenaline, noradrenaline, aldosterone, and vasopressin were measured in 13 patients in sinus rhythm without apparent heart failure and in 13 patients in atrial fibrillation. The two groups were matched for left atrial diameter and the ratio of the left atrial diameter to the diameter of the aortic root (assessed by echocardiography). There were no significant differences in age, heart rate, blood pressure, or left ventricular end diastolic diameter between the two groups. Left atrial diameters varied from 33 to 60 mm. The mean (SD) plasma concentration of ir-ANP was significantly higher (35 (21) pmol/l) in the patients with atrial fibrillation than in those in sinus rhythm (12 (11) pmol/l). The concentration of plasma aldosterone was also higher in patients with atrial fibrillation (831 (366) v 523 (211) pmol/l). Concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and vasopressin were similar in both groups. None of the hormone concentrations correlated with left atrial dimensions. These results indicate that plasma concentrations of ir-ANP and aldosterone are highly sensitive indicators of changes in haemodynamic function during atrial fibrillation. They also underscore the difficulties of correlating echocardiographic assessment of patients with plasma concentrations of a vasoactive hormone.\r"

The serum levels of type III collagen aminopropeptide (P-III-P), the laminin PI (Lam PI) fragment and the acid lysosomal beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) were determined by specific radioimmunoassays and spectrofluorometry, respectively. Increased levels of type III collagen aminopropeptide strongly correlated with enhanced activity of beta-galactosidase. Both parameters correlated with the clinical course in idiopathic systemic scleroderma and in silicosis-associated scleroderma. Serum levels of Lam PI were also found to be elevated in both groups, although there was no correlation with the severity of the disease. Autoantibodies directed against the DNA topoisomerase Scl-70 and against centromeric proteins were found in a similar range in patients with idiopathic systemic and silicosis-associated scleroderma. These results suggest that P-III-P, Lam PI and beta-Gal are useful serological markers of fibrotic activity and demonstrate similarities between idiopathic systemic scleroderma and scleroderma associated with silica-dust exposure.\r"

High concentrations of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and reduced concentrations of oestradiol (E2) were observed in the follicular phases of the PPS cycles suggesting that the phenomenon is a product of abnormal follicular metabolism. An association of PPS with infertility exists, perhaps related to a combination of disturbances in the follicular micro-environment compromising oocyte quality, a failure of oocyte release, and impaired endometrial receptivity.\r"

The white matter responded to hypercapnia with a greater fall in intracellular pH than the grey matter. This could either be due to differences in blood flow between grey and white matter in response to hypercapnia or to differences in intracellular pH regulation/buffering between these two tissues.\r"

To this end, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone were measured in the upright and recumbent position and during incremental infusions of angiotensin II (1, 3 and 6 ng of angiotensin II amide min-1 kg-1 for 1 h each dose) after 6 days of sodium loading (study 1), after 5 days of sodium depletion (study 2) and after sodium depletion plus infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (0.13 microgram/min for 8 h) on the test day (study 3). Six normal young males were investigated. 3. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels were around 5 pmol/l in study 2, 15 pmol/l in study 1 and 15 pmol/l in study 3 during infusion of atrial natriuretic factor. Two hours after the onset of atrial natriuretic factor infusion, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone (recumbent) were markedly and significantly lower in study 3 than in study 2, but still significantly higher than in study 1. The increase in plasma aldosterone after infusion of angiotensin II was slightly, but not significantly, blunted by infusion of atrial natriuretic factor in study 3 compared with study 2. The overall increase in plasma aldosterone was still significantly greater in study 3 than in study 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nasogastric tube is preferred for short-term feeding, while gastrostomy or jejunostomy is indicated for long-term or permanent nutritional support. Nutritional assessment should be done initially and on a regular basis. Specific formulas are available to calculate height, weight, and caloric needs of bedbound elderly patients. Various enteral feeding formulas are available for a specific clinical condition and are preferably administered by continuous drip using a pump. Parenteral nutrition is also indicated for certain situations in which enteral feeding cannot meet the patient's nutritional requirement, and in particular situations where enteral feeding is contraindicated and not feasible.

Follow-up studies in 39 of the cases 25 months (mean) postprocedure indicated 82% of the patients to be symptom-free, with the remaining 18% demonstrating a marked improvement. Postoperative manometry as well as cineradiography carried out in 12 patients revealed the presence of UES motility dyscoordination in 8% and 25%, respectively. There were, however, no signs of recurrence of the diverticulum. The high number of patients in our study group demonstrating motility disorders of the UES emphasizes the need for cervical myotomy as part of the surgical therapy for Zenker's diverticulum.\r"

The significance of these alterations was investigated. Pancreatitis was induced by injecting 5% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Iloprost (ZK 36374, a stable analog of prostaglandin I2, 25 ng/kg body weight) decreased the mortality rate from 100% to 50%. When treatment with iloprost was combined with simultaneous administration of either Sibelium (flunarizine R 14,950, 0.2 mg/kg body weight) or dazmegrel (UK 38,485, 50 mg/kg body weight) an additional decrease in the mortality rate was recorded. Dazmegrel is a selective thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor and flunarizine (a calcium entry blocker) also inhibits the effects of elevated thromboxane A2 levels. With flunarizine and iloprost the mortality rate was 40% (P less than 0.05); with dazmegrel and iloprost it was 10% (P less than 0.01). The results of the present study suggest that thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 play a role in the course of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy exists regarding major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on hepatocytes. In this study, hepatocyte expression of class I and II major histocompatibility complex antigens was investigated in diseased and normal livers, using indirect immunofluorescent staining of mechanically isolated, viable hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were obtained from 76 children: 10 with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, nine with primary sclerosing cholangitis, nine with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, five after liver transplantation, 19 with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 11 with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, four with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis and nine with histologically normal liver. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all cases; flow cytofluorimetry was performed for class I antigens in 38 cases and performed for class II antigens in 18 cases. From three children with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and two with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, isolated hepatocytes were also incubated with gamma-interferon before staining and analysis. By fluorescence microscopy, class I antigens were detected on hepatocytes from all children, the highest percentage (100%) of positive cells and the most intense staining were observed in untreated patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis and in those with acute rejection of a liver transplant. Reduced class I antigen expression occurred in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Class II antigens were only detected on hepatocytes from eight patients: three with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and five with primary sclerosing cholangitis, all untreated. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis confirmed the results obtained by fluorescence microscopy, but it also demonstrated a weak class II antigen expression during liver allograft rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our data indicate that cells bearing genetically engineered CD8 molecules incorporating a glycoinositolphospholipid membrane anchor, as well as fixed cells bearing natural CD8 molecules, retain specific, CD8-dependent immunoregulatory activity. These findings together support the novel concept that CD8, a molecule traditionally thought of as a receptor, can function as an inhibitory ligand. CD8-dependent inhibition was shown to induce nonresponsiveness, persisting for at least 24 h, in Ag-specific responders. Moreover, only cells undergoing primary, but not secondary, antigenic stimulation through their TCR were found to be susceptible to CD8-dependent inhibition. Both CD4+ and CD8+ responding T cells were inhibited by CD8+ modulatory cells. These functional analyses of inhibitory and responder cells in CD8-dependent inhibition lay the groundwork for developing artificial CD8-based immunomodulatory peptides and deciphering CD8's role in natural immunoregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Current data suggest that the combination of IL-2 plus IL-6 or IL-4 supports the generation of a CTL response. In this report, we investigated whether IL-7 alone or in combination with other lymphokines supports the generation of active CTL from murine thymocytes. Added alone, IL-7 produced a modest CTL response, and this response was augmented (more than an additive response) by the addition of either IL-2, IL-6, or IL-4. After culture with IL-7, the removal of CD8+ cells correlated with a marked decrease in killing, whereas removal of the CD4+ population resulted in an enhanced CTL response. IL-7 generated a proliferative response to which the addition of other lymphokines resulted in an additive increase at best. To determine if the CTL response was found with IL-7 was dependent on the presence of endogenous lymphokines, we added blocking mAb and found that anti-IL-2 or anti-IL-6 blocked the level of CTL generated in the presence of IL-7. In contrast, anti-IL-4 was unable to inhibit CTL generation. The effect of the mAb on proliferation was somewhat paradoxical. The addition of anti-IL-2, anti-IL-6, or anti-IL-4 to cultures containing IL-7 all caused a significant decrease in proliferation that was overcome by the addition of the corresponding human lymphokines for IL-2 and IL-6. If thymocytes were fractionated and then cultured in the presence of IL-7, the double negative population gave the greatest proliferative response, the single positive thymocytes gave a response that was approximately 40% less, and the double positive thymocytes did not proliferate. These data indicate that IL-7 supports the induction of a cytotoxic response, however, this appears to require the presence of both IL-2 and IL-6.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to examine the expression and function of IL-2R on murine macrophages. We used a model system of murine macrophage cell lines (ANA-1 and GG2EE) that was established by infecting normal murine bone marrow-derived cells with the J2 (v-raf/v-myc) recombinant murine retrovirus. ANA-1 macrophages did not constitutively express detectable levels of mRNA for the p55, IL-2R alpha. However, a brief exposure to IFN-gamma was sufficient to induce IL-2R alpha mRNA in ANA-1 macrophages. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that ANA-1 macrophages expressed low constitutive levels of IL-2R alpha on their cell surface that were augmented after treatment of the cells with IFN-gamma. Affinity binding and cross-linking of [125I]IL-2 to ANA-1 macrophages demonstrated that IL-2R alpha and the p70-75, IL-2R beta were both present on ANA-1 macrophages constitutively. IFN-gamma increased the expression of IL-2R alpha on ANA-1 macrophages but did not increase the expression of IL-2R beta on these macrophages. Although IL-2 alone did not induce the tumoricidal activity of ANA-1 macrophages, IL-2 acted synergistically with IFN-gamma to induce macrophage tumoricidal activity. These data demonstrate the expression of IL-2R on murine macrophage cell lines and establish the role of IL-2 as a costimulator of macrophage-mediated tumoricidal activity.\r"

  ".U": "90361874\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have established that different cytokines induce distinct patterns of activation in cultured endothelial cells (EC). Treatment of EC with either TNF or IL-1 causes transient induction of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) and a sustained increase in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. TNF but not IL-1 also increases class I MHC Ag expression. IFN-gamma, which by itself increases EC class I MHC and ICAM-1 but does not induce ELAM-1 expression, has been found to act synergistically with TNF to increase class I expression. In our study, we have further examined IFN-gamma effects on both TNF and IL-1 beta responses. In contrast to IFN-gamma plus TNF cotreatment, IFN-gamma up-regulation of class I MHC molecules is not augmented by cotreatment with IL-1 beta. IFN-gamma plus TNF cotreatment synergistically increases ICAM-1 expression by 24 h of cotreatment, whereas IFN-gamma plus IL-1 beta cotreated EC show at most additive increases. IFN-gamma increases TNF-induced ELAM-1 expression such that a greater number of EC express ELAM-1 at both 4 and 24 h in the presence of IFN-gamma plus TNF compared to cultures treated with TNF alone, although the maximal level of surface expression on individual cells is not increased. Inasmuch as these times represent pre- and post-peak expression time (6 h), respectively, IFN-gamma appears both to accelerate and to prolong transient ELAM-1 expression. Although similar interactions are seen with IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma has a consistently greater effect on TNF-induced compared to IL-1-induced ELAM-1 expression. We next explored the possible mechanism(s) of the synergy between IFN-gamma and TNF. IFN-gamma and TNF do not cooperatively enhance total protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, IFN-gamma and IL-1 beta combine to depress protein synthesis, which may contribute to the failure of these cytokines to positively interact. IFN-gamma and TNF cooperatively increase ELAM-1 mRNA at 6 h and ICAM-1 mRNA at both 6 and 24 h, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-1 show markedly less cooperative augmentation of these transcripts. We conclude that IFN-gamma enhances TNF-induced EC activation by selectively and synergistically increasing synthesis of specific surface molecules, whereas IL-1-induced EC activation is largely unaffected by IFN-gamma.\r"

In combination, these cytokines exhibited a synergistic effect, and the potentiating effect of IL-4 was inhibitable by polyclonal anti-IL-4 antisera. Because the binding of radiolabeled polymeric IgA (pIgA) to HT-29 cells was inhibited by unlabeled pIgA or a polyclonal anti-SC reagent, but not by IgG, monomeric IgA, or Fab alpha fragments, we conclude that the receptor involved in the increased binding of pIgA is indeed SC. These data suggest that the expression of SC on human epithelial cells and the subsequent binding of pIgA (produced in mucosal tissues and glands by subepithelial plasma cells) is regulated by lymphokines such as IL-4 and IFN-gamma that are presumably derived from T cells found in abundant numbers in these tissues. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway of interaction between T cell products and epithelial cells that may result in enhanced translocation of large amounts of locally produced pIgA through epithelial cells into external secretions.\r"

  ".U": "90361877\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that splenic T cells from mice that bear IgA myelomas, as well as certain T cell lines, express receptors for the Fc of IgA, and are termed Fc alpha R. In this study, we have isolated and characterized two CD3+ T cell lines derived by fusion of murine Peyer's patch (PP) CD4+ T cells with the BW 5147 lymphoma cell line. These cell lines, designated PPT4-6 and PPT4-16, were shown to bind monomeric or dimeric IgA, whereas the fusion partner did not bind either form of IgA. However, polymeric IgA (m.w. 600,000) bound equally well to all three cell lines. Similar results were also obtained with two known Fc alpha R+ T cell lines, ThHA1 nos. 9 and 10. Immunoprecipitation studies with IgA on PPT4-16 and ThHA1 no. 9 have shown that IgA binds to a 38-kDa protein. A rabbit antiserum was prepared to a 38-kDa fraction of Fc alpha R+ T cell membranes, and heterophilic antibody was removed from the antiserum by adsorption with mouse thymocytes, BW 5147 and R1.1 lymphoma. The antiserum bound to both PPT4-16 and ThHA1 no. 9 as well as to other Fc alpha R+ T cells, but did not bind to thymocytes or to the T lymphomas R1.1 or BW 5147. The antiserum appeared specific for the Fc alpha R, because it failed to block binding of anti-CD3 (145 2C11) or other surface molecule-specific antibodies. Further, competitive inhibition studies with IgA and anti-Fc alpha R (38 kDa) showed that preincubation of Fc alpha R+ T cells with the anti-38-kDa protein completely eliminated IgA binding, whereas IgA partially blocked the binding of the anti-Fc alpha R antibodies to the cell membrane. Immunoisolation with the anti-Fc alpha R antibody of radioiodinated cell membrane proteins from Fc alpha R+ T cells, but not from Fc alpha R- cells, gave a distinct band at 38 kDa. To further test the specificity of this antiserum, we have isolated T cells from spleens of IgA-myeloma bearing mice, and tested the phenotype and IgA binding. A subset consisting of 15 to 20% of CD3+, CD8+ T cells was found that bound monomeric or dimeric IgA. Further, the anti-Fc alpha R antiserum also recognized this CD8+ T cell subset, and preincubation of the cells with antibody resulted in their failure to bind IgA. Our results indicate that the Fc alpha R on T cell lines derived from PP is a 38-kDa protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90361891\r", 
  ".W": "Neutrophils contain several distinct classes of secretory granules that may sequentially fuse with the phagosome after the ingestion of particulates, or that may be differentially exocytosed after cellular activation with soluble stimuli. The exocytosis of neutrophil secretory granules has been shown to be GTP-dependent at a step distal to activation of the transductional G proteins. Inasmuch as ras-related low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins have been shown to play regulatory roles in vesicle sorting in the secretory pathway in yeast, the differential mobilization of neutrophil granules might be regulated by distinct GTP-binding proteins. We therefore explored the distribution and identity of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins in neutrophil secretory granules and other subcellular fractions. After lysis by nitrogen cavitation, four highly resolved fractions were harvested from discontinuous Percoll gradients: a microsomal fraction enriched for plasma membranes, specific granules, primary granules, and cytosol. At least seven bands of distinct Mr were detected by probing protein blots with [32P]GTP. Microsomes contained a prominent GTP-binding band at 26 kDa and weaker ones at 24 and 22.5 kDa; specific granules contained bands at 26, 24, 22, and 20 kDa; primary granules showed bands at 24 and 23 kDa; cytosol showed strong bands at 23.5 and 19 kDa and a weak band at 26 kDa. Antiserum against ADP-ribosylation factor reacted strongly with the 19-kDa band in cytosol but with none of the membrane fractions. None of these proteins was recognized by antibodies against ras or against Sec4p. Botulinum exoenzyme C3 labeled bands of molecular mass 20 and 21 kDa in cytosol and microsomes that have distinct mobilities from all the blotted [32P]GTP-binding proteins. The highly compartmentalized subcellular distribution of the blotted [32P]GTP-binding proteins in neutrophils is consistent with a regulatory role in the differential mobilization of granule compartments during cellular activation.\r"

  ".W": "Apoptosis is regarded as a suicidal cell response since the dying cell appears to be an active participant. Previous studies have shown that apoptosis of various murine cell types, induced by a variety of stimuli, required RNA and/or protein synthesis. However, when human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 or microtubule-disrupting agents, in the presence of inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis, apoptosis of these cells was neither abrogated nor delayed. Furthermore, the presence of either cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or actinomycin D, an RNA synthesis inhibitor, alone was found to induce large scale apoptosis of these cells. Apoptosis in these cells was characterized by cell and chromatin condensation followed by nuclear and DNA fragmentation. In common with many other studies, this DNA fragmentation was found to have an approximately 200-bp multiple pattern, which is consistent with the activation of an endogenous endonuclease which cleaves at internucleosomal sites. Calcium-dependent endonuclease activity of this type was also detected in the isolated nuclei of untreated HL-60 cells. The morphologic and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis were found to precede cell death, as measured by trypan blue uptake and were completely distinct from death caused by toxic stimuli such as azide, ethanol, or heat treatment. Similar experiments with six other human cell lines confirmed that this phenomenon was not peculiar to the HL-60 cell line. These results suggest that certain dividing cell populations do not require RNA or protein synthesis to undergo apoptosis and further, that continuous transcription and translation of some regulatory protein(s) may be required to maintain control over the apoptotic \"machinery\" of such cells.\r"

The IFN-gamma-mediated suppression was also observed both in serum-free culture and in single-cell culture. In addition, mAb to mouse IFN-gamma neutralized the suppressive effect of IFN-gamma on CTMC proliferation supported by the combination of IL-3 + IL-4. These observations suggest a direct antiproliferative effect of IFN-gamma on CTMC. No suppression of CTMC proliferation was observed when CTMC were washed with alpha-medium after 24 h of preincubation with IL-3 + IFN-gamma and then cultured in methylcellulose medium containing IL-3 + IL-4. IFN-gamma had suppressive effects on CTMC after preincubation with IL-3 + IL-4. These preincubation studies suggest that IFN-gamma exerts a reversible inhibitory effect on CTMC which have entered into a proliferative state by IL-3 + IL-4, and has neither cytotoxic nor irreversible suppressive effects on resting CTMC in cultures containing IL-3 alone. CTMC proliferation after stimulation with the cross-linking of cell-bound IgE by specific Ag in the presence of IL-3 was also suppressed by IFN-gamma. By contrast, proliferation of CTMC induced by the combination of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate + IL-3 was not affected by the addition of IFN-gamma to the culture. Based on these observations, we suggest that IFN-gamma antagonizes the colony inducing effect of IL-4 and IgE-Ag stimulation which act synergistically with IL-3 on CTMC.\r"

  ".U": "90361898\r", 
  ".W": "We have shown previously that certain proteases can modulate the affinity of human Fc gamma RII for IgG. To study whether proteolytic events not only increase FcR affinity, but are essential for Fc gamma R functioning, we evaluated the effect of different protease inhibitors on binding mediated by two classes of human monocyte IgG FcR. These R, Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII, can be analyzed selectively in rosetting assays by employing E sensitized by either human IgG or mouse IgG1. Rosetting by both classes of R was inhibited profoundly by incubation of monocytes with different types of serine protease inhibitors such as diisopropylfluorophosphate, PMSF, or N alpha-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethylketone. The type II Fc gamma R was much more sensitive to inhibition than Fc gamma RI. We, therefore, studied these effects in more detail by using cell line K562, which expresses only Fc gamma RII. PMSF, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and N alpha-tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethylketone were, again, inhibiting Fc gamma RII-mediated binding dose-dependently, whereas several inhibitors of metal, aspartic, or thiol proteases proved ineffective. Furthermore, Fc gamma RII-mediated rosetting on both cell types was profoundly inhibited by the addition of different small synthetic substrates of serine esterases. In an attempt to discriminate whether the proteolytic event is an intra- or extracellular process, macromolecular antiproteases such as soybean or ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor or alpha 1-antiprotease were tested. Fc gamma RII-mediated binding by K562 cells was not susceptible to macromolecular antiproteases, in contrast to monocytes. In the presence of drugs which interfere both with receptor recycling and intracellular traffic between endosomal compartments (e.g., primaquine or monensin), the effects of inhibitors were largely abrogated. This showed that endocytosis of inhibitors might be essential, indicating the proteolytic event to be intracellular. Our findings suggest that human monocyte Fc gamma RII-mediated functioning is dependent upon the action of one or more serine proteases.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of expressed VH genes that hybridized to both CDR probes or to the 5' CDR2 probe were greater than or equal to 97% homologous to 18/2 in both the framework and CDR regions.

  ".W": "The differentiation Ag identified by the mAb M1/69 and J11d (commonly referred to as heat-stable Ag) are found in structurally heterogeneous forms on the surfaces of many types of murine hemopoietic cells. The extinction of expression of these antigens is associated with thymocyte maturation and Ig class switching in B cells, as well as terminal differentiation of macrophages. A cDNA encoding the M1/69-J11d peptide was cloned from a hemopoietic progenitor cell line by immunoselection of COS cells transfected with expression libraries. The cloned cDNA is a copy of a gene that is transcribed in M1/69-J11d+ lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid cells. This gene could be responsible for the expression of all forms of the M1/69-J11d Ag, although there are homologous genes that may encode some forms of the Ag that are specifically expressed in bone marrow. The cloned cDNA encodes a surprisingly small peptide, predicted to contain only 30 amino acids after removal of a signal sequence and displacement of the C-terminal region by the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol group that anchors the peptide to the cell surface. Almost all of the mass of the M1/69-J11d Ag accumulates through extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation at multiple sites in the short peptide. These carbohydrates are likely to execute the functions of M1/69-J11d Ag, which could be specialized to each cell type as a consequence of differential glycosylation.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies demonstrated that allorecognition of HTB176.10 and HTB177.2, H-2Kb-reactive CD4-CD8- T cell hybridomas is markedly influenced by the exchange of the alpha 3 domain between H-2Kb and H-2Dp. The recombinant genes of the exon 4 between H-2Kb and H-2Dp were constructed to determine the residues of the alpha 3 domain that influence the allorecognition of these T cell hybridomas. Seven recombinant genes of the exon 4 were generated by in vivo recombination in Escherichia coli. Chimeric genes containing these recombinants were transfected into L cells and the transfectants expressing equivalent amounts of chimeric molecules were selected by flow cytometry. Studies on responses of these T cell hybridomas to the chimeric molecules confirmed our previous observation that the primary structure of the alpha 3 domain influences the allorecognition by the hybridomas. Moreover, it was indicated that residue 256 on the alpha 3 domain markedly affects the allorecognition by the T cell hybridomas, although substitutions at residues 184, 193, 195, 197, 262, and 264 exerted some effects on the T cell recognition. Further studies with the use of a single amino acid mutant of H-2Kb at residue 256 confirmed the effect of substitution at residue 256 on allorecognition of the T cell hybridomas. Taken together, results of this study demonstrated that polymorphism of the alpha 3 domain is indeed involved in the formation of allodeterminants recognized by TCR.\r"

  ".U": "90361910\r", 
  ".W": "The data demonstrate that IL-7, a cytokine that was originally identified, purified, and cloned based upon its ability to support the growth of pre-B cells in vitro, also induces proliferation and promotes the generation of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity in populations of resting peripheral lymphoid cells. Although the kinetics of LAK induction by IL-7 (which peaked at days 6 to 8 of culture) was slower than that detected in cultures containing IL-2 (which peaked at day 4), IL-7 was significantly more effective at maintaining cytotoxic activity over longer periods of time, and greater viable cell recoveries, than was IL-2. A wide range of murine tumor target cells were found to be lysed in an MHC-unrestricted fashion by IL-7 induced LAK, but syngeneic Con A-induced lymphoblasts were not; nor were target cells from the human tumors K562 or Daudi lysed by IL-7 LAK. IL-7 LAK were induced in populations of lymphoid cells obtained from secondary lymphoid tissues (peripheral lymph nodes and spleen), but not from primary lymphoid tissues (thymus and bone marrow). LAK induced by IL-7 from unfractionated populations of lymphoid cells were completely eliminated by treatment with anti-CD8 or anti-Thy-1+C, and unaffected by treatment with anti-CD4, anti-asialo GM1 or anti-NK1.1+C. Interestingly, although no detectable CD4+ effector cells could be detected in populations of LAK generated from unfractionated populations of lymphoid cells stimulated by IL-7, they were found to be generated from populations of lymphoid cells from which CD8+ cells had been eliminated before being cultured in medium containing IL-7. These data suggest that CD4+ T cells do not normally give rise to IL-7-induced LAK unless they are first separated from CD8+ T cells. LAK induced by IL-7 appear to be distinct from LAK activity induced by IL-2 in that there is no detectable involvement of NK-like effector cells at either the precursor or effector cell stages.\r"

  ".W": "It is essential to image the carotid bifurcation adequately in patients with symptomatic carotid territory ischaemia if they are being considered for carotid endarterectomy. Optimal resolution is achieved by selective intraarterial contrast angiography which is an invasive procedure carrying some risk. The overall risk-benefit of carotid endarterectomy is currently being investigated in several large randomised trials in Europe and North America. Because cerebral angiography is a prerequisite for carotid endarterectomy, the risks of cerebral angiography will need to be added to those of surgery when considering whether carotid endarterectomy is effective in the management of these patients. This study evaluated prospectively 382 patients with symptomatically mild carotid ischaemia who had cerebral angiography to visualise a potentially resectable lesion at the carotid bifurcation. Complications followed 14 cerebral angiograms in 13 patients (3.4%); two complications were local (0.5%), two systemic (0.5%) and 10 were neurological (2.6%). The neurological complications were transient (TIA 1, generalised seizure 1) in two patients (0.5%), reversible (stroke) in three (0.8%) and permanent (stroke) in five patients (1.3%). There were no deaths. The significant risk factors for post angiographic stroke were (1) stroke before angiography compared with transient ischaemic attacks of the eye or brain and (2) the presence of greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis of the symptomatic internal carotid artery; unfortunately it may be the latter patients who are most at risk of stroke as part of the natural history of their disease and therefore most in need of prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (which requires cerebral angiography).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Their computer tomography (CT) scans showed abnormal hypodense white matter. The MRI showed a four layered appearance of the cerebral parenchyma extending from the frontal to the occipital region. There was a normal appearance to the white matter in the periventricular region which had an abnormally smooth junction with a thick diffuse layer of heterotopic grey matter. This was surrounded by a thin layer of white matter which had normal digitations with the overlying cortex. The appearance of the overlying cortex was normal. These and other recently described cases broaden the concept of generalised disorders of neuronal migration and illustrate that it is possible to have a generalised cerebral malformation with few clinical consequences.\r"

  ".W": "We designed a prospective study of height potential in girls with idiopathic precocious puberty, comparing the presenting features of girls with and without evidence of reduced adult height potential. The 14 girls with impaired adult height prognoses (group 1) were reexamined after treatment with a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist, nafarelin. The seven girls with the prognosis of unimpaired height (group 2) were followed without therapy. We found that the group could be distinguished at initial examination by the greater bone age/height age ratio of group 1 (mean +/- SEM: 1.4 +/- 0.06 vs 1.0 +/- 0.05; p less than 0.005) and by the greater difference between predicted height and target height in group 1. The mean predicted height in group 1 was significantly less than the mean target height (150.7 +/- 2.1 vs 165.4 +/- 3.0 cm; p less than 0.005), whereas the mean predicted and target heights in group 2 were similar (165.4 +/- 3.0 vs 164.3 +/- 2.1 cm). Initial estradiol levels were also greater in group 1 than in group 2 (21.6 vs 10.6 pg/ml; p less than 0.05), although this difference was not sustained during follow-up. In group 1, nafarelin therapy suppressed the pituitary-gonadal axis, and although there was a transient reduction in height potential in girls with the youngest bone ages during the first 6 months of therapy, 2 years of treatment slightly improved predicted heights from 150.7 +/- 2.1 to 152.7 +/- 2.0 cm (p less than 0.05). Height predictions also increased without therapy during the 2-year observation period in group 2, from 165.4 +/- 3.0 to 168.7 +/- 4.1 cm (p less than 0.05). Our data indicate that gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist therapy preserves height potential in girls with an initially impaired height prognosis, and that height potential is preserved without therapy in those with a good initial height prognosis.\r"

  ".W": "In an investigation of the effects of intrauterine, intravascular transfusions (IUT) on fetal and neonatal hemolysis and erythropoiesis, 12 fetuses who received IUT for treatment of severe isoimmunization had serial measurements of hemoglobin concentration, Kleihauer-Betke stains to detect fetal hemoglobin-containing erythrocytes, and determination of plasma erythropoietin (EPO) concentration before each IUT, at birth, and postnatally. Reticulocyte counts and sensitizing antibody titers were measured in five fetuses. Mean values before the first IUT, before the final IUT, and at birth were as follows: hemoglobin level, 6.1, 9.1, and 11.3 gm/dl; reticulocyte count, 22.7%, 0.5%, and 0.9%; fetal hemoglobin-containing erythrocytes, 100%, 1.6%, and 1.5%; and EPO level, 12, 56, and 756 mU/ml, respectively. Only one neonate required exchange transfusion. In the first month postnatally, all infants had a profound anemia. All but one infant required simple blood transfusions postnatally. Before the first postnatal transfusion, mean hemoglobin concentration was 6.2 gm/dl, mean reticulocyte count was 0.8%, mean erythropoietin concentration was 23 mU/ml, and the sensitizing antibody titer remained markedly elevated. Except for the surge of EPO at birth, EPO levels did not rise prenatally or postnatally unless marked anemia (hemoglobin level less than 5 gm/dl) occurred. These observations suggest that the intrauterine and postnatal anemia in fetuses who receive IUTs may be explained both by hemolysis of newly formed erythrocytes by circulating antibody, which typically persisted for more than a month after birth, and by suppressed erythropoiesis.\r"

This approach does not assume that the underlying dose-response curve is steep; nor does it assume that maximally dose-intense regimens are clinically appropriate in all situations. Whether the identified regimen is superior to standard treatments should be determined by prospective, randomized clinical trials. Determining which drugs to combine and in what proportions to combine them offers combinatorially huge numbers of possibilities. The method described here offers one approach to identifying combinations worthy of evaluation in prospective trials.\r"

Three isolates were resistant to spectinomycin. All isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Resistant isolates were identified from all participating centers. Patient demographic and behavioral characteristics were not predictive of infections caused by resistant organisms. These results demonstrate the wide distribution of antimicrobial-resistant N gonorrhoeae and support recent changes in Centers for Disease Control therapy recommendations for gonococcal infections that no longer recommend tetracycline and penicillin as first-line therapies.\r"

The tendency to secrete detectable levels of thyroid autoantibodies was significantly correlated with an increased rate of miscarriage. Thyroid autoantibody-positive women miscarried at a rate of 17%, compared with 8.4% for the autoantibody-negative women. Individual levels of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies were similarly related to this increased miscarriage rate, with no evidence of autoantibody specificity in the relationship. Furthermore, the increase in miscarriages could not be explained by differences in thyroid hormone levels, the presence of cardiolipin autoantibodies, maternal age, gestational age at the time of maternal entry into the study, or previous obstetric history. We conclude that thyroid autoantibodies are an independent marker of \"at-risk\" pregnancy.\r"

Most of the patients defined as potentially hazardous for transfer (10/11) did not require neurosurgical intervention. The delay by the use of the system was negligible and early detection of intracranial haematoma contributed to good outcome in some head injured patients. Overall, 3,170 miles of ambulance journey were avoided.

Six dogs were evaluated and all underwent vasectomy and subsequently had vasovasostomies performed between 4 and 12 weeks utilizing two approximating sutures and welding with the milliwatt carbon dioxide laser. Metal clips were used for both X-ray analysis and localization of the vasovasostomy site. In this investigation a vasogram was performed. Dogs were sacrificed at 4, 6, and 8 weeks postvasovasostomy. The vasovasostomy specimens were studied with electron microscopy and histological evaluation. The vasovasostomy was completed in under 120 minutes using this laser-assisted technique and was found to be a viable and promising technique for vasovasostomy.\r"

We have previously reported the induction of diabetes in transgenic mice (ins-IFN-gamma) in which the expression of the lymphokine IFN-gamma is directed by the insulin promoter. This diabetes is a result of the progressive destruction of pancreatic islets that occurs with the influx of inflammatory cells. Here we demonstrate that this islet cell loss is mediated by lymphocytes, that engrafted histocompatible islets are destroyed, and that lymphocytes from the transgenic mice are cytotoxic to normal islets in vitro. These results indicate that the pancreatic expression of IFN-gamma can result in a loss of tolerance to normal islets, consistent with its role as an inducer of costimulatory activity, which is essential for lymphocyte activation during an immune response.\r"

Tubular lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, for example, undergo such extension in association with microtubules, and this process has been mimicked in vitro by combining purified microtubules with isolated membranes and the mechanochemical ATPase kinesin. This, along with evidence that kinesin is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, has led to the suggestion that kinesin provides the motive force for the formation and maintenance of elongated tubulovesicular structures in cells. We have addressed this hypothesis in murine macrophages, which have prominent tubular lysosomes whose form depends on the integrity of microtubules. Here we report that two antikinesin antibodies which disrupt in vitro motility will each cause centripetal collapse of the array of tubular lysosomes when scrape-loaded into macrophages. To our knowledge this provides the first in vivo evidence that kinesin is responsible for extension of tubulovesicular structures along microtubules.\r"

  ".W": "Although phage lambda represents a well studied biological systems, it has certain features that remain obscure. Among these is the function of the roughly one third of the phage genome dispensable for growth in the laboratory, yet retained despite undoubted pressure to economize. Here we report that these 'accessory' sequences contain two genes which are expressed during lysogeny, and encode host-cell envelope proteins. One of these is lom, the product of which is found in the bacterial outer membrane, and is homologous to virulence proteins of two other enterobacterial genera. The other gene, previously unidentified, we designate bor. Expression of bor significantly increases the survival of the Escherichia coli host cell in animal serum. This property is a well known bacterial virulence determinant--indeed, bor and its adjacent sequences are highly homologous to the iss serum resistance locus of the plasmid ColV2-K94, which confers virulence in animals. These results show that the lambda prophage is more transcriptionally active than has long been assumed, and suggest that lysogeny may generally have a role in bacterial survival in animal hosts, and perhaps in pathogenesis.\r"

Radiolabeled lymphocyte studies show promise, in that lymphocytes are intimately involved in the rejection process. However, there needs to be further research to determine if the specificity of the technique can isolate those patients who require treatment. The data involving labeled antimyosin antibody fragments indicate that they can specifically detect myocyte necrosis that occurs on the microscopic level. However, it may also be too sensitive a technique for transplanted hearts, which are so immunologically active at baseline to determine when treatment is necessary.\r"

Moreover, these mice had diminished T cell responses to the vaccinia viral antigens. Tumor-primed T cells transferred into B cell-deficient mice effectively eradicated disseminated FBL.

Nonmotile cells fail to sporulate and to express C-factor-dependent genes, but both defects were rescued by a simple manipulation of cell position that oriented the cells in aligned, parallel groups. A similar pattern of aligned cells normally results from coordinated recruitment of wildtype cells into multicellular aggregates, which later form mature fruiting bodies. It is proposed that directed cell movement establishes critical contacts between adjacent cells, which are required for efficient intercellular C-factor transmission.\r"

Transtracheal delivery of oxygen permits adequate oxygenation of such patients at lower flow rates than are required for delivery by nasal cannulas, thus increasing the time for which portable oxygen cylinders can be used and improving the efficacy of domiciliary oxygen concentrators in patients with refractory hypoxaemia. In a study of the long term acceptability and risks of transtracheal oxygen in 37 patients, with a total follow up of 595 patient-months, most patients reported symptomatic benefit and four have used transtracheal oxygen successfully for more than four years. Problems have included surgical emphysema (4 patients), catheter fracture (9), local infection (34), and catheter dislodgement (21); but these have been relatively infrequent and in general have not caused important clinical problems. Transtracheal oxygen therapy was discontinued in 10 patients before death for various reasons, including infection (2 patients), catheter fracture (1), and surgical emphysema (1). Accumulation of mucus balls has not been a problem. It is concluded that transtracheal oxygen therapy is a safe and acceptable alternative to nasal cannulas in well motivated patients with hypoxaemia due to chronic airflow limitation who are keen to pursue an active life.\r"

Urinary symptoms were ameliorated in the majority of cases (11/12). Prostatic size was measured by rectal ultrasound, an accepted accurate new modality. In 12 patients a decrease in size was demonstrated, and only in 1 progressive case the prostate grew larger on a six-month follow-up. Thus prostatic size and clinical responsiveness are not correlated. The clinical value of recording urinary symptomatology and measuring prostatic size in prostatic carcinoma patients is discussed with regard to the latest communications that GnRH analogues acting by decreasing testosterone levels, can cause amelioration in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) cases, too. It is suggested that prostatic size has little clinical value concerning tumor responsiveness in the follow-up of patients with prostatic carcinoma.\r"

A similar study was designed in which delayed invasive treatment was compared with conservative treatment in 201 patients with acute myocardial infarction given recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. The 97 patients randomized to the invasive group underwent routine coronary angiography and angioplasty 5 +/- 2 days after thrombolytic therapy, whereas the 104 patients randomized to the conservative group underwent angiography only for recurrent postinfarction angina or exercise-induced ischemia. Baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. In the invasive group, 92 patients underwent angiography, 49 angioplasty and 11 coronary artery bypass surgery. In the conservative group, 40 patients experienced early ischemia, 39 underwent angiography, 20 angioplasty and 4 coronary artery bypass surgery. Reinfarction rate and preservation of left ventricular function at discharge or 8 weeks after discharge did not differ in the 2 groups. Total mortality after a mean follow-up of 10 months was 8 of 97 in the invasive and 4 of 104 in the conservative groups (p = 0.15). However, if only patients who died after the timing of the scheduled protocol catheterization in the invasive arm were included, mortality was 5 of 94 and 0 of 100 in the invasive and conservative treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.02).

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy has become the treatment of choice for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Researchers are not yet able to identify patients with salvage of myocardium who are at risk for recurrent coronary events. Thus, a prospective trial was performed in 46 patients with myocardial infarction (28 anterior and 18 inferior) who received thrombolytic therapy to determine if early thallium tomography (4.7 days) using oral dipyridamole would identify more patients with residual ischemia than early symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests (5.5 days). There were no complications during the exercise treadmill tests or oral dipyridamole thallium tomography. Mean duration of exercise was 11 +/- 3 minutes and the peak heart rate was 126 beats/min. Thirteen patients had positive test results. After oral dipyridamole all patients had abnormal thallium uptake on the early images. Positive scans with partial \"filling in\" of the initial perfusion defects were evident in 34 patients. Angina developed in 13 patients and was easily reversed with intravenous aminophylline. Both symptom-limited exercise treadmill tests and thallium tomography using oral dipyridamole were safely performed early after myocardial infarction in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. Thallium tomography identified more patients with residual ischemia than exercise treadmill tests (74 vs 28%). Further studies are required to determine whether the results of thallium tomography after oral dipyridamole can be used to optimize patient management and eliminate the need for coronary angiography in some patients.\r"

The hemodynamic and humoral effects of a 2-hour intravenous saline infusion were studied in 25 borderline hypertensives characterized on the basis of their forearm venous distensibility (VV30) in normal (n = 15) and low (n = 10) VV30. VV30 was slightly reduced by saline in the entire hypertensive group (1.47 vs 1.36 ml/100 ml; p less than 0.05), whereas blood pressure and plasma Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor were unchanged. Normal VV30 showed a sudden increase in plasma Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor in response to saline associated with an increase in blood pressure, a forearm arterial and venous constriction, and a sluggish suppression in plasma renin activity, whereas low VV30 exhibited a completely opposite pattern. The changes in plasma Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor inversely correlated to VV30 decreases in borderline hypertensives with normal VV30 (r = -0.49; p less than 0.05), whereas they did not in all hypertensive patients. Atrial natriuretic peptide response to saline infusion was delayed in normal VV30 and inversely related to the changes in Na/K+ ATPase inhibitory activity (r = -42; p less than 0.05) attained after 2 hours of infusion in the entire hypertensive population. Results of this study suggest the ability of acute volume expansion to reduce peripheral venous distensibility in borderline hypertensive patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At peak effect, nitroglycerin produced almost identical hemodynamic changes in both groups, with significant decreases in right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, systolic blood pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. Cardiac index increased. The extent of nitrate tolerance was calculated for each hemodynamic parameter as the percentage loss of the peak effect achieved by the drug. At 24 hours, 98 +/- 80% of the benefit achieved with respect to right atrial pressure was lost in group 1 and 61 +/- 74% in group 2 (group 1 vs 2, difference not significant). For pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, 51 +/- 31% (group 1) and 85 +/- 53% (group 2) (difference not significant) of the effect was lost, and for cardiac index, 53 +/- 58% (group 1) and 54 +/- 44% (group 2) (difference not significant). Tolerance was also almost identical regarding systolic blood pressure and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Thus, the extent of tolerance to high-dose intravenous nitroglycerin in CHF was unaltered by administration of captopril, indicating that in clinical dosage, counter-regulatory neurohumoral mechanisms involving the renin-angiotensin system appear to be unimportant in its development.\r"

Results indicate that MCT is oxidized more rapidly and completely than in LCT; approximately 90% of the MCT is converted to carbon dioxide with in 24 h compared with 45% for LCT.

Removal of MCT from the blood was more rapid than was removal of LCT, and tissue radioactivity was lower.\r"

During the last 7 h of TPN, animals were further randomized to have either saline or E coli endotoxin added to the infusate. Acid-base status and serum lactate concentrations were determined. Animals infused with soybean fat emulsions and endotoxin developed a significant metabolic acidosis, lactic acidemia, and decrease in mixed venous O2 compared with controls and fish-oil-treated animals (p less than 0.05). The significantly reduced serum lactate and higher mixed venous O2 in fish-oil-infused animals suggests that the underlying mechanism involves improvement in endotoxin-induced tissue hypoperfusion, presumably through alterations in prostaglandin metabolism.\r"

The pathological diagnosis was that of cardiomyopathy due to prolonged selenium deficiency. The patient had been on total parenteral nutrition for 17 mo, following extensive bowel resection for intractable pain, nausea, and vomiting caused by chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction.

We analyzed serum apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) concentrations of approximately 600 pedigreed baboons that were fed two dietary regimens: (1) a basal diet and (2) an atherogenic (high-cholesterol, saturated-fat) diet. Complex segregation analysis was performed separately for apo A-I concentrations in each dietary environment. A major locus model with a recessive allele for high levels of apo A-I and a polygenic component best fit the family data for both diets. Using bivariate segregation analysis, we showed that the major genes detected in the univariate analyses represent two distinct loci that act additively to determine apo A-I concentrations. These two loci accounted for approximately 40% of the total phenotypic variance in apo A-I levels in each dietary environment and were also responsible for 33% of the variation in apo A-I response to the atherogenic diet. Both major loci were influenced by genotype-diet interaction in which the two-locus genotypes exhibited heterogeneous responses to the atherogenic diet. Most genotypes responded to the atherogenic diet with an increase in apo A-I, but two genotypes showed a decrease that can be traced to the effect of one of the major loci. The presence of two major loci and genotype-diet interaction may be responsible for the equivocal results obtained in human pedigree studies of apo A-I.\r"

  ".W": "We have used RFLPs of the apolipoprotein (apo) B gene and apo AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster to estimate the genetic contribution of variation at these loci to the variability of plasmid lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein levels in 209 children from Sezze in central Italy. The sample was randomly divided into group I (107 children) and group II (102 children). Four site polymorphisms (PvuII, XbaI, MspI, and EcoRI) of the apo B gene and five site polymorphisms (XmnI, PstI, SstI, PvuII-CIII, and PvuII-AIV) of the apo AI-CIII-AIV gene cluster were examined in group I children. After adjustment for gender, age, and body-mass index, polymorphisms at both gene loci (PvuII-B, PvuII-CIII, and PvuII-AIV) were associated with significant effects on the levels of plasma apo AI, apo B, or high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. RFLPs that showed significant effects in group I were genotyped in group II. All three polymorphisms were associated with similar effects on apolipoprotein levels, though for all RFLPs the magnitude of the effects was smaller in the group II children and only statistically significant for the effect of the PvuII-B genotype on apo AI levels. In the total sample of 209 children 7.4% of the sample variance in apo AI levels was explained by variation associated with the apo B PvuII-B RFLP. In addition, the PvuII-B RFLP was associated with significant effects on plasma apo B levels and explained 5.7% of the sample variance. The PvuII-CIII and PvuII-AIV polymorphisms were both associated with differences in apo AI levels, explaining 3.7%-5.7% of the sample variance. Taken together, the three PvuII polymorphisms explained 17.7% of the phenotypic variance in apo AI levels. There was significant evidence for an effect of nonlinearity of the PvuII-CIII genotypes on apo AI levels, with the individuals heterozygous for the polymorphism having the highest apo AI levels. No evidence of interaction between genotype and gender, age, and body-mass index was shown by covariance analysis. The molecular explanation of this effect is unclear. Our data show that variation at both the apo AI-CIII-AIV and apo B loci are associated with lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels in this sample of Italian children.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-two adult patients selected to undergo renal transplantation participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS: Patients randomized to receive TMP-SMZ experienced fewer hospital days with fever (3.3% versus 7.7%, p less than 0.001) and significantly fewer bacterial infections during the transplant hospitalization after removal of a urethral catheter (0.76 versus 1.88 per 100 days, p less than 0.005) and following discharge from the hospital (0.08 versus 0.30 per 100 days, p less than 0.001). During the transplant hospitalization, a daily dose of 320/1,600 mg was highly effective for prophylaxis whereas 160/800 mg daily gave unexpectedly low blood levels and was effective only for prevention of urinary tract infections after catheter removal. Prophylaxis was most effective in prevention of infections of the urinary tract (24 versus 54, p less than 0.005) and bloodstream (one versus nine, p less than 0.01) and infections caused by enteric gram-negative bacilli (four versus 46, p less than 0.001), enterococci (six versus 22, p = 0.006), or Staphylococcus aureus (one versus nine, p = 0.01). Prophylaxis did not prevent urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheters in the early posttransplant period, but after catheter removal, reduced the risk of urinary tract infection threefold (p less than 0.001). No significant differences in colonization by TMP-SMZ-resistant gram-negative bacilli were identified between the two groups; patients given TMP-SMZ were, paradoxically, less likely to become colonized by candida, probably because of less exposure to antibiotics for treatment of infection. Recipients of prophylaxis did not have a higher rate of infection caused by TMP-SMZ-resistant bacteria or Candida; however, their infections were more likely to be caused by resistant bacteria than infections in patients in the placebo group (62% versus 18%, p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis with TMP-SMZ, which is well tolerated, significantly reduces the incidence of bacterial infection following renal transplantation, especially infection of the urinary tract and bloodstream, can provide protection against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and is cost-beneficial. Subnormal absorption of TMP-SMZ in the early posttransplant period mandates 320/1,600 mg daily for optimal benefit. Prophylaxis has little discernible effect on the microflora.\r"

To extend these studies to an established chronic model, C3H/Hej mice were infected with the Sylvio X10/4 clone. This clone does not cause symptomatic acute disease but does induce cardiac pathology incorporating several pathological features of human chagasic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac pathology was assessed at 60, 90, and 180 days postinfection. There was a significant decrease in the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in the group infected and treated with verapamil. Myocardial beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase (AC) activity was determined 180 days postinfection. In the infected group not treated with verapamil, there was no significant change in the maximum rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP (Vmax) or in the concentration of agonist giving 50% of Vmax (apparent Kact) for isoproterenol (ISPN)-dependent AC activation. The increase in Vmax for ISPN determined in the presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) was consistently lower in infected than in uninfected mice, suggesting that infection altered the potential synergistic activation of AC by the guanine nucleotide. In the infected group treated with verapamil, there was a slight increase in the Vmax for ISPN. However, there was a marked enhancement of the synergistic contribution of Gpp(NH)p. These observations suggest that verapamil had preserved that aspect of the AC complex mediating guanine nucleotide sensitive activation of AC. Collectively, the observations in the acute and chronic models of murine Chagas' disease suggest that verapamil may be a useful adjunct in treatment.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the efficacy of low-flow endobronchial insufflation (EI) with air, as it may be useful in emergency situations in which positive-pressure mechanical ventilation is not possible. The only equipment required is a source of compressed air with flow controller and a specially designed insufflation catheter. The insufflation catheter has forked ends that can be positioned blindly in the mainstem bronchi. In six anesthetized, apneic dogs averaging 9.6 kg, we determined that the average air flow needed to maintain PaO2 above 45 mm Hg and PaCO2 below 65 mm Hg after 30 min was 2.5 L/min. At these flow rates, all dogs survived 2 h of endobronchial insufflation with no neurologic dysfunction. The small internal diameters (0.8 mm) of the catheter ends increase gas exit velocity and allow for adequate oxygenation and CO2 removal at low flow rates. Endobronchial insufflation could also be employed with cricothyroidotomy and a compressor for emergency situations in the field involving mass casualties, where oxygen supplies and equipment are limited.\r"

The Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 or 7 at the time of the study. Data were collected in the operating room before and during (5 and 15 min) administration of propofol (2 mg/kg iv bolus immediately followed by a 150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 infusion) before surgical stimulation. Propofol was infused during 41.4 +/- 7.3 min. After operation, the last set of measurements was made 15 min after propofol was stopped. The study was performed on 10 adults (age range, 15-40 yr) whose lungs were mechanically ventilated (air/O2) and who were sedated (phenoperidine, 1 mg/h), and was conducted using a radial artery cannula; a 7.5-Fr, thermodilution, flow-directed, pulmonary artery catheter; an intraventricular catheter; and a catheter in the jugular venous bulb. The 133xenon intra-internal carotid artery injection technique was used to determine regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Anesthetic blood concentration of propofol (3-5 micrograms/ml) was associated with decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP; from 82 +/- 14 to 59 +/- 7 mmHg; P less than 0.001), rCBF (from 35 +/- 6 to 26 +/- 5 ml.100 g-1.min-1; P less than 0.001), and intracranial pressure (ICP; from 11.3 +/- 2.6 to 9.2 +/- 2.5 mmHg; P less than 0.001).

  ".W": "Cerebral blood volume (CBV = cerebral plasma volume [CPV] + cerebral red cell volume [CRBCV]) is one determinant of intracranial pressure. In an effort to quantitate the effects of anesthetics and PaCO2 on CBV, the authors measured cerebral plasma volume (CPV) in normocapnic (PaCO2 approximately 42 mmHg) and hypocapnic (PaCO2 approximately 22 mmHg) rats receiving 1 MAC doses of isoflurane or halothane, or given an approximately equivalent dose of pentobarbital. All animals were paralyzed, their lungs mechanically ventilated, and body temperature kept normal throughout the study. CPV was measured using 14C-labeled dextran, a large (70,000 molecular weight [M.W.]), nondiffusible compound that was given intravenously and allowed to circulate for approximately 5 min. The experiments then were terminated by freezing the brains in situ with liquid N2 poured into a funnel affixed to the exposed calvarium. Isotope concentrations in solubilized brain and in plasma were determined by scintillation counting, and CPV was calculated as the ratio between these values. CPV during both hypocapnic and normocapnic pentobarbital anesthesia was less than with either volatile agent. During normocapnia, CPV for pentobarbital = 2.1 +/- 0.26 ml/100 g (mean +/- SD, n = 8), compared with 2.96 +/- 0.44 ml/100 g (n = 9) and 3.06 +/- 0.44 ml/100 g (n = 9) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively. There were no differences in CPV between the two volatile agents during normocapnia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Responses to pharmacologic vasodilators, including nitroglycerin (NTG) and adenosine, were also studied for comparison. The relaxation induced by halothane in concentrations of 0.8-2.3% and by NTG (10(-9)-10(-5) M) was greater in proximal large coronary arteries than in distal small ones contracted with 20 mM KCl. In contrast, the relaxation by isoflurane (1.2-3.5%) and by adenosine (10(-8)-10(-4) M) was greater in small coronary arteries than in large ones. These results suggest that isoflurane is, like adenosine, preferentially a small artery dilator.\r"

Patients were males with a mean age of 63 years. Of the 86 patients, 71 (82%) had bronchitis caused by a single organism (29 by Haemophilus influenzae, 27 by Branhamella catarrhalis, 9 by gram-negative enteric organisms, 6 by Streptococcus pneumoniae), while more than one pathogen was implicated in 15 patients (18%). A total of 70.8% of the cefixime group and 50% of the cephalexin group were clinically cured (chi 2 = 3.89, P less than 0.05); however, when the categories of cured and improved were combined, no significant difference was noted between treatment groups (chi 2 = 3.39, P = 0.06). Analysis of side effects included all 130 evaluable and nonevaluable patients: diarrhea was noted in six patients in the cefixime group and none of the patients in the cephalexin group (P = 0.013 by the Fisher exact test). The diarrhea was mild and self-limited in all cases. B. catarrhalis has emerged as a major cause of exacerbation of bronchitis in our experience; there is an increased need to emphasize the examination of sputum samples by Gram staining if cost-effective antibiotic choices are to be made; any empirically chosen antibiotic should have activity against beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. catarrhalis as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.\r"

Both vancomycin and ampicillin-sulbactam readily killed this resistant enterococcus strain in vitro. At a challenge inoculum of approximately 10(9) CFU, vancomycin (40 mg/kg intravenously [i.v.]), ampicillin (40 mg/kg i.v.), or a combination of ampicillin plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor, sulbactam (20 mg/kg, i.v.), did not prevent the development of endocarditis in any of the animals, although mean intravegetation bacterial densities were significantly lower in animals that received vancomycin than they were in animals that received other therapies (P less than 0.001). At a challenge inoculum of 10(6) CFU, vancomycin was 100% effective in preventing enterococcal endocarditis compared with ampicillin (29%; P less than 0.00001) and ampicillin-sulbactam (65%; P less than 0.01). Factors associated with the superior prophylactic efficacy of vancomycin in this model included prolonged serum inhibitory activity and time above MICs. Factors not associated with the antienterococcal prophylactic efficacy of vancomycin included the duration of the in vitro postantibiotic effect of the drug and the magnitude of the ability of this drug to enhance enterococcal in vitro opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The superior prophylactic efficacy of vancomycin in this endocarditis model related to the superior pharmacokinetic profile of the drug when it was given intermittently at dose intervals of every 6 h.\r"

We examined 14 East African clinical isolates from the Kenya Trypanosomiasis Research Institute strain bank plus 2 established isolates for susceptibility to DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine and to standard trypanocides. Seven of 16 strains were partially or totally refractory to DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine in our test system. Four strains were also refractory to arsenical drugs, and five were refractory to diamidines.

  ".W": "A comparison of efficacies, costs, and effects on vaginal microflora of one preoperative and three postoperative 1-g doses of cefazolin versus those of one preoperative 1-g dose of ceftriaxone was done with 65 and 73 women, respectively, undergoing elective vaginal hysterectomy. Patient infection rates were not statistically different between the cefazolin group (six events in 6 of 73 patients [8.2%]) and the ceftriaxone group (11 events in 9 of 65 patients [13.8%]). Side effects, including diarrhea, were minimal and similar between the two groups. Significant shifts in the cervicovaginal microflora of the patients occurred postoperatively, with a marked increase in enterococci and a drop in nonenterococcal streptococci. No shifts among aerobic, facultative gram-negative rods and staphylococci were observed. Among the anaerobes, a significant decrease in the number of patients harboring nonsporulating, gram-positive rods and a less striking concomitant increase in Bacteriodes species and members of the family Peptococcaceae were noted. No qualitative differences were noted between the two groups that received prophylactic therapy. Aside from enterococci, cefazolin or ceftriaxone resistance among vaginal isolates (greater than or equal to 10(3)/ml) was minimal. Selection of resistant isolates was not different between the treatment groups. We could not detect a difference between a single 1-g dose of ceftriaxone and multidose cefazolin for infection prophylaxis in patients undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy. However, the total acquisition, preparation, and administration costs were greater for the ceftriaxone regimen than they were for the cefazolin regimen. Cefazolin should therefore remain the drug of choice for infection prophylaxis in uncomplicated vaginal hysterectomies.\r"

AZT was approximately 100 times more potent than the dideoxypurine nucleosides, inducing sulA at less than 100 ng/ml. 2',3'-Dideoxythymidine (ddT) and 2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydrothymidine (D4T) induced sulA at 100 to 1,000 micrograms/ml, while 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) weakly induced prophage lambda. Activity relationships thus were AZT greater than ddA greater than or equal to ddI greater than or equal to ddG greater than ddT = D4T greater than ddC. ddA and ddI had equivalent activities in agar diffusion assays, but different activity profiles were observed in liquid microsuspension assays. The differences may be related to drug metabolism. AZT and ddA showed marginal effects in a DNA repair (preferential toxicity) assay in which E. coli WP2 and CM871 uvrA recA lexA were used. Furthermore, none of the agents was able to preferentially inhibit Bacillus subtilis M45 recA relative to wild-type strain H17. These data suggest that AZT and the dideoxynucleosides do not cause DNA lesions that are repairable by excision repair and/or error-free postreplication repair processes. Rather, the SOS response appears to be induced by DNA chain termination leading to the inhibition of DNA replication. Bacterial assays for induction of the SOS response may be useful as simple, rapid prescreens for the discovery of new anti-HIV agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A theophylline dosage individualized to obtain a mean theophylline concentration in plasma of 10 +/- 3 micrograms/ml was administered for 1 week to each subject. At week 2, oral fleroxacin (400 mg once daily) was added. Theophylline concentrations in plasma were measured with TDx (Abbott Diagnostics, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and urinary excretion of theophylline and its three major metabolites was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total theophylline clearance remained essentially unchanged throughout the study period (3.5 and 2.9 liters/h in the young and the elderly, respectively) both after a single fleroxacin dose and after multiple doses. Although significant changes occurred in the urinary excretion of unchanged theophylline and its metabolites after a single fleroxacin dose, no changes were observed after multiple doses. Side effects consisted mainly of gastrointestinal and sleep disturbances, more related to theophylline; photosensitivity was observed in six subjects and was attributed to fleroxacin. We conclude that fleroxacin may be administered concomitantly with theophylline in either young or elderly patients. Close monitoring of theophylline concentrations in serum should be performed, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for whom data are currently lacking.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-61827; T-3262) against 15 clinical isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis and 31 recent clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including 15 spectinomycin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and 16 penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, was determined. Tosufloxacin was compared with doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and temafloxacin against C. trachomatis. Susceptibility testing was performed by using McCoy cell monolayers. The in vitro activity of tosufloxacin against N. gonorrhoeae was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and spectinomycin by using an agar dilution method. Tosufloxacin was as active as temafloxacin against C. trachomatis (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml; MBC for 90% of strains tested [MBC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and was almost as active as doxycycline (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml; MBC90, 0.125 microgram/ml). Ciprofloxacin, temafloxacin, and tosufloxacin were extremely active against N. gonorrhoeae, including spectinomycin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, with MIC90s of 0.004, 0.015, and 0.008 microgram/ml, respectively. Ceftriaxone was slightly less active (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and doxycycline was the least active drug tested (MIC90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). Tosufloxacin and temafloxacin had excellent activity against the C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae strains tested.\r"

Treating normal A+ cells with commercial anti-A antisera, anti-Rho(D) antisera, or with saturating concentrations of purified Rho(D) antibodies had no effect on phosphatidylserine transport. Normal B- cells treated with purified anti-B antibodies transported phosphatidylserine at rates equal to those of cells not treated with antibody. Rhnull cells, deficient in the protein bearing the Rho(D) antigen, incorporated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylserine at rates and to extents similar to normal cells. Furthermore, incorporated phosphatidylserine, but not phosphatidylcholine, was rapidly transported across the membrane bilayer. Energy depletion or treatment with sulfhydryl reagents inhibited phosphatidylserine transport equally in normal and Rhnull cells. These results indicate that, although Rhnull cells have numerous membrane defects, they are capable of adenosine triphosphate-dependent transport of exogenously added dimyristoylphosphatidylserine. Normal phosphatidylserine transport in the presence of anti-Rho(D) antibodies or in cells deficient in the Rho(D) polypeptide indicates that this protein is not the aminophospholipid transporter.\r"

  ".W": "After bone marrow transplantation (BMT), mortality from viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains high. Gamma-Interferon (gamma IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are produced constitutively after BMT and have anti-viral properties. To study the effects of these cytokines on CMV interaction with host cells, we have used patient marrow fibroblasts since marrow stroma is a target for CMV infection correlating with myelosuppression in vivo. Both gamma IFN and TNF are constitutively produced by recipient CD3+ and CD16+ lymphocytes, but not by their marrow fibroblasts. Secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is increased if they are cultured with host fibroblasts infected with CMV in vitro and the levels of gamma IFN and TNF produced are within the range that protects fresh fibroblasts from CMV infection. Constitutive secretion of cytokines by lymphocytes declines by 8 weeks after BMT, a time when the risk of CMV disease increases sharply. The in vitro phenomenon that we have described needs to be evaluated in correlative studies on individual BMT recipients to determine whether such a cytokine-mediated defense mechanism against CMV may operate in vivo.\r"

No significant transfusion reactions occurred. Before treatment with porcine factor VIIIC, all five had high-level, high-responding anti-human VIIIC inhibitors initially lacking anti-porcine factor VIIIC activity. Although specific anti-porcine VIIIC inhibitors arose in all patients, these were generally transient, and only one patient became refractory to treatment. We believe that porcine factor VIIIC is the treatment of choice in patients whose inhibitors do not cross-react. All five patients lost their original anti-human VIIIC inhibitors after starting treatment with porcine VIIIC, permitting the reintroduction of human VIIIC in three of them. There has been no recurrence of anti-human VIIIC inhibitor activity during 2 to 3 years of regular treatment with human VIIIC in these patients. This suggests that tolerance to human VIIIC has arisen as a result of treatment with porcine VIIIC. Porcine VIIIC may have a role in the desensitization of some factor VIIIC inhibitor patients.\r"

The clonogenic cells require a rich medium, Opti-MEM (GIBCO/BRL, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), and a source of T-cell-derived factors for growth. The conditions described appear to be limiting for the colony progenitor, suggesting assay clonality. Three novel methods that permit routine and rapid detection of these human B-cell colonies are also described. Colonies containing cells that secrete immunoglobulin are detected by plaquing and protein immunoblotting, while RNA transcripts can be detected by RNA colony blotting. The detection of more than one secreted immunoglobulin isotype or RNA species in a single colony can also be achieved. This B-cell colony assay and the associated detection methods will allow the further delineation of human B lymphopoiesis in both normal and disease states.\r"

The results showed that P40 stimulated the proliferation of some IL-3-dependent myeloid cell lines of both early myeloid and mast cell phenotype and synergized with IL-3. P40 did not promote proliferation of fresh bone marrow cells, bone marrow enriched for early myeloid cells by 5-fluorouracil treatment, or bone marrow derived mast cells as assessed in 3H-TdR incorporation assays. P40 did not influence the growth of murine colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage in agar cultures, either alone or in the presence of optimal or sub-optimal concentrations of CSF-1, GM-colony-stimulating factor, or IL-3. P40 did potentiate burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) formation in the presence of erythropoietin; however, this was dependent on the cell plating density, suggesting an indirect stimulation of BFU-E by P40. The indirect nature of P40 action on BFU-E was further demonstrated in cell separation experiments and indicated that the effect was mediated by T cells. These data expand the repertoire of cells that P40 influences.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated the properties of recombinant staphylokinase in comparison with those of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and streptokinase (SK). The presence of fibrin(ogen) fragment FCB-2 in the reaction mixture increased plasminogen activation by staphylokinase more than 20-fold. Such characteristics are similar to those of t-PA. On the other hand, SK was not affected by the presence of FCB-2. The thrombolytic properties of staphylokinase were studied in a system consisting of a radioactive human plasma clot (125I-fibrinogen-labeled) suspended in the circulating citrated plasma. Significant thrombolysis (50% in 3 hours) was obtained with 2 micrograms/mL of staphylokinase and 4.45 micrograms/mL t-PA, as compared with 12 micrograms/mL for SK. The relative molar potency of staphylokinase, calculated from the molecular weight, was about two times more effective than that of SK, but about half of that of t-PA. Systemic fibrinolytic activation and fibrinogen breakdown was not observed with staphylokinase or t-PA, but was observed with SK. The thrombolytic efficiency of staphylokinase, which was calculated as the ratio of the degree of thrombolysis/the degree of fibrinogenolysis, was about five times greater than that of SK, and about half of that of t-PA. These findings suggest that staphylokinase has higher specific thrombolytic properties and lesser fibrinogenolytic properties than those of SK.\r"

PAI-1 activity and t-PA/PAI-1 complex antigen were measured in citrated plasma; these measurements were corrected for the loss in PAI-1 activity and increase in complex that occurs in unacidified plasma samples due to the continued reaction between t-PA and PAI-1 after the sample was drawn. To convert t-PA and PAI-1 activity measurements into molar concentrations we determined the specific molar activity of t-PA and PAI-1 in vivo: 4.48 x 10(13) IU/mol. Of 72 subjects studied, 13 had less than 150 pmol/L active PAI-1; in these individuals 33% +/- 21% of their t-PA was active and the molar ratio of active t-PA to active PAI-1 was 0.20 +/- 0.13. In the 11 subjects with greater than 500 pmol/L active PAI-1, 1.5% = 1.1% of the t-PA was active and the molar ratio of active t-PA to active PAI-1 was 0.0043 +/- 0.0036. Overall, the fraction of active t-PA declined exponentially as a function of the active PAI-1 concentration. During the day, the percentage of total t-PA that was active increased from 12% at 8:00 AM to 31% at 8:00 PM, while the molar ratio of active t-PA to active PAI-1 increased from 0.05 to 0.22 from morning to evening (n = 12).\r"

  ".W": "The effect of fish oil administration on platelet function was studied in eight normal individuals, four men and four women, who received fish oil equivalent to 6 g eicosapentaenoic acid per day for a period of 25 days. Platelet aggregation, platelet adhesion, phospholipid and fatty acid distribution were measured at periodic intervals before, during, and after the period of fish oil administration. Platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and collagen showed a moderate increase in ED 50 in response to the administration of fish oil. Conversely, platelet adhesion to fibrinogen and collagen I, which was studied at low shear rates in a laminar flow chamber, showed a striking 60% to 65% decrease after fish oil supplementation of the diet. The change in adhesiveness could be correlated with the pseudopodia formed in response to agonistic stimulation. Scanning electron microscopic examination of adherent platelets showed an overall reduction of pseudopodia that appeared short and stubby on fish oil administration. The profile of the fatty acids extracted from plasma confirmed compliance of the volunteers with their dietary supplements. Analysis of phospholipids showed changes in sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylcholine between pseudopodia and platelet cell bodies. Fish oil administration did not affect their overall distribution except for a moderate decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine in platelet pseudopodia. Changes were also recognized in the total fatty acids extracted from platelets, affecting primarily arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid. There were no changes in platelet adhesiveness in a group of five normal individuals who received a vegetable oil supplement of equal dose and duration as that of the fish oil. We conclude from these studies that fish oil, at least when administered over a limited period of time, is an effective inhibitor of platelet adhesiveness.\r"

There was abundant incorporation of the sulfate label into a product identified as factor V by immunoprecipitation, lability to proteases, affinity for the lectin jacalin, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two or more sites in factor V incorporated sulfate as indicated by labeling of different peptide chains of factor Va. The 150-Kd activation fragment of factor Va incorporated the greatest amounts of sulfate. This fragment of factor Va was bound selectively by jacalin-agarose, reflecting its content of O-linked oligosaccharides. Analysis of an alkaline hydrolysate of sulfate-labeled factor Va by anion-exchange chromatography showed that the sulfate occurred partly in tyrosine sulfate residues and partly in alkaline-labile linkages. Sulfate groups are potentially important structural and functional elements in factor V, and labeling with [35S]sulfate provides a useful approach for examining the biosynthesis and processing of this protein. The hypothesis is advanced that sites of sulfation in factor V and several other plasma proteins contribute to the affinity and specificity of thrombin for these molecules, just as it does for the interaction of thrombin with the potent inhibitor hirudin from leeches.\r"

Within the B-cell lineage we found that the expression of B-ly-7 was highly specific for HCL and reacted with all 28 cases examined, as well as with 3 of 9 cases of a variant form of HCL. Cells of other closely related B-cell disorders, prolymphocytic leukemia, and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes were negative. Investigation of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with HCL before and after treatment with alpha-interferon or deoxycoformycin suggests that B-ly-7 may be useful in the assessment of minimal disease after therapy. In addition to HCL, we found that B-ly-7 was positive with cells of three mature, CD4+ T-cell malignancies. In view of the reactivity with malignancies of activated B and T cells, we searched for the expression of B-ly-7 on activated, normal B and T cells and found that B-ly-7 reacted specifically with activated normal peripheral blood CD8+ T cells. B-ly-7 has a number of applications, including the precise classification of mature B-cell neoplasia and the diagnosis HCL and its assessment after treatment. In addition, B-ly-7 recognizes a small subset of T-cell disorders. Its expression on these malignancies and on in vitro activated peripheral blood CD8+ T cells suggests that B-ly-7 detects a lymphocyte activation antigen.\r"

DESIGN--A cohort analysis covering 1981-9 comparing estimated cumulative incidences of and seroconversion rates for anti-HCV with those of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). SETTING--Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark. SUBJECTS--259 Male members of a Danish homosexual organisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations of prevalence and incidence with a wide range of sexual lifestyle variables. RESULTS--Only four (1.6%) subjects were positive for anti-HCV in 1981. The estimated cumulative incidence of positivity for anti-HCV was 4.1% in 1984 (seroconversion rate during 1981-4 (2.5%)) and remained at 4.1% in 1989 (seroconversion rate nil during 1984-9). In contrast, positivity for anti-HBC rose from 44.0% in 1981 to 52.7% in 1984 (seroconversion rate 15.5%) and 58.8% in 1989 (seroconversion rate 12.9%), and that for anti-HIV rose from 8.8% to 24.0% (seroconversion rate 16.7%) and 30.1% (seroconversion rate 8.0%) respectively. Three anti-HCV positive patients seroreverted three to five years later. None of the anti-HCV positive subjects had had a transfusion and only one gave a past history of intravenous drug use. Variables in sexual lifestyle correlated with the presence of anti-HBc but not with that of anti-HCV. CONCLUSIONS--In contrast with hepatitis B virus and HIV, sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus seems to be a rare event. Furthermore, antibodies to the virus may become undetectable after several years.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess the prevalence of potentially reversible locomotor disabilities in elderly subjects and the cost effectiveness of providing aids for daily living. DESIGN--Population based randomised controlled trial of subjects aged greater than or equal to 85 living independently in an inner London borough. SETTING--21 Electoral wards of the London Borough of Hackney. SUBJECTS--1255 Subjects aged greater than or equal to 85 living in their own home whose names were obtained from general practitioner lists and cross checked against the electoral register, 511 of whom were subsequently found to be ineligible. Of the 744 remaining, those with disability on screening were randomised and allocated to an intervention group (36) or a control group (43), in which intervention was postponed until four weeks, after the follow up assessment. Subjects with aids supplied previously were excluded from the intervention phase. INTERVENTIONS--Provision of raised toilet seat, teapot tipper, tap turner, shoe horn and elastic laces, and double handled saucepan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Degree of difficulty (grades 1-4) with specific tasks (getting on and off a toilet, pouring from a teapot into a cup, turning taps on and off, carrying a saucepan of standard weight, and putting on shoes) and time taken to perform them. RESULTS--545 (73%) Of the 744 eligible subjects assessed; 428 had no disability and 118 had difficulty with at least one task. Some had had their disability recognised before the study and already had aids, representing half of those with difficulty getting on and off the toilet but 24% for putting on shoes and 13% for pouring from a teapot and turning on a tap. The mean number of difficulties was similar between the groups (intervention group 1.7, control group 1.6). Time taken to complete the tasks corresponded with the observed grade of difficulty. All aids were associated with reduced difficulty according to observer assessment (% improvement intervention group v control group: raised toilet seat, 71 v 13 teapot tipper 100 v 33; tap turner 100 v 0; saucepan 88 v 0; shoe horn 50 v 13) and time taken to complete the tasks. A cost benefit analysis of this screening-intervention programme suggested a total cost of 32 pounds per individual benefit. CONCLUSIONS--Appreciable degrees of unrecognised locomotor disability are detected on screening of very elderly people living independently. Providing aids offers a feasible and cost effective means of improving function in such people.\r"

Extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy (EPL) has the advantage of being non-invasive, whereas endourological management can treat the underlying anatomical problem. A total of 20 patients with calculi in caliceal diverticula were treated with EPL. Twelve of 16 patients with symptoms (75%) were rendered symptom-free but only 5 (25%) became stone-free. This information should be of value in counselling patients before selecting the appropriate treatment.\r"

An 'incisionless' technique under local anaesthesia, namely percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, was described in 1980. A review of the literature shows that the percutaneous technique is safer for the patient, easier and faster to perform and considerably cheaper than surgical gastrostomy. As the few complications usually require surgical management, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy should be considered a surgical technique. Few patients are unsuitable for the percutaneous endoscopic technique and this route should be considered for all patients referred for a gastrostomy.\r"

Of the 80 patients, 56 had affected cervical nodes, seven had inguinal nodes, five had axillary nodes and 12 had multiple sites of lymph node involvement. All had enlarged nodes which were matted in 44 cases and discrete in 18 cases, while the rest had either an abscess or a discharging sinus. Fifty-nine cases (74 per cent) showed a positive Mantoux test and four cases (5 per cent) had associated pulmonary tuberculosis. Fine needle aspiration cytology gave a positive diagnosis in 66 cases (83 per cent). Fifty-two cases showed a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis of human type in Lowenstein-Jensen medium. Short-term chemotherapy (9 months) consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol gave an excellent result. Surgery was not required in any of the cases.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of extra branched chain amino acids (BCAA) has been associated with a nitrogen sparing effect in septic and traumatized patients. Whether nitrogen sparing is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality rates is unknown. We therefore undertook a prospective, randomized, double blind trial investigating the effects of BCAA enrichment of a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimen on nitrogen balance, 3-methylhistidine excretion, morbidity as evidenced by disturbances in organ function, severity of sepsis and mortality. One hundred and one patients entered the study; 52 received a standard TPN solution and 49 a BCAA-enriched solution. Both groups received 30 kcal kg-1 body-weight, 15 per cent fat calories and 0.17 g nitrogen kg-1 body-weight. In the BCAA-enriched group, patients received 0.56 g BCAA kg-1 body-weight (50.2 per cent BCAA). Standard group patients received 0.18 g BCAA kg-1 body-weight (15.6 per cent BCAA). Nitrogen balances and 3-methylhistidine excretion were not significantly different between groups. Although morbidity scores tended to decrease during the study no difference was observed between groups. Mortality (early or late), sepsis or stress-related, did not differ significantly between groups. We were not able to confirm the reported beneficial effects of BCAA-enriched TPN solutions for use in septic and traumatized patients.\r"

  ".U": "90366904\r", 
  ".W": "The contribution of radon daughter exposure to excess lung cancer in underground miners is universally accepted. These miners received exposures from tens to thousands of WLM in a relatively few years. Although the miners were also exposed to other noxious agents in mines, the appearance of the excess lung cancer mortality in several types of mines and the increase with increasing exposure provide convincing evidence of the role of radon as the carcinogen. It is conceivable that exposures to radon at an average concentration of one to two pCi/liter, the levels for a majority of homes, might not produce excess lung cancers. This would require that a lifetime exposure at low concentrations produce a different response from that of a few years at higher levels for the miners. This is unlikely but not impossible. The current environmental epidemiology is of varying quality. The better studies may give some answers in a few years. These studies are more likely to establish an upper limit of risk than to provide an exposure-response model. Present risk estimates cannot be used accurately in estimating the overall lung cancer risk to the US population, since there are no good data on average exposure and exposure distribution. For example, the number of homes above the EPA guideline of four pCi/liter may range from two million to 10 million. An estimate of the actual radon exposure in the US may be forthcoming from a planned EPA survey, but these data will not be available for a few years. In the conservative tradition of radiation protection, indoor radon exposures in homes are estimated to produce a number of excess lung cancers in the population. One estimate by the NCRP is about 10,000 deaths per year in the US, for an average annual estimated exposure of 0.2 WLM (about one pCi/liter). The National Academy of Sciences (BEIR IV) estimates 13,000 deaths for the same exposure, and the EPA's estimate is 5,000 to 20,000.\r"

  ".W": "At least 30 epidemiologic studies designed to identify an association between hormone-replacement therapy and breast cancer risk have been published since 1974. In general, the design, quality, and analytic strategies used in these studies have improved over the years, and the number of subjects in each study has increased. The results from studies published prior to 1985 can be summarized as showing a small increase in the risk of breast cancer after many years of estrogen use. Even this tentative conclusion is debatable, however, since many rigorous studies showed no association between estrogen use and breast cancer. This review will summarize the earlier findings and emphasize several large, recent studies that add at least two new dimensions to this body of research; they provide data from Europe and on the addition of progestins to the therapeutic regimen. This review indicates the following: 1. Analyses of ever versus never use of estrogen-replacement therapy show no association with breast cancer risk. 2. Duration of estrogen-replacement therapy affects risk. Based on studies in the United States, a relative risk of about 1.5 may be reached after 15 or more years of use. 3. The increase in risk after long-duration hormone use is present for women with either a natural or a surgical menopause. 4. European studies exhibit higher risks after shorter durations of hormone use than do US studies. 5. The type of estrogen used and the addition of progestins to hormone-replacement therapy may alter the risk of breast cancer. Data that substantiate these points are reviewed and placed in context with hormonal theories of carcinogenesis.\r"

The patient was completely thyroidectomized for \"malignant adenoma\" in 1923, with neither thyrotoxicosis then nor hypothyroidism postoperatively; 15 years later there developed classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism and severe pain in the lower back. In October 1939 a pulsating tumor removed from the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra proved to be metastatic thyroid adenocarcinoma (histologically well differentiated, with small follicles and colloid). In the next two years hyperthyroidism increased and roentgenograms revealed new metastases in the lungs, upper part of the right femur, second rib on the left side, left ilium, and skull. Roentgenologic irradiation of the metastases proved ineffectual. In March 1943 a tracer dose of radioactive iodine revealed iodine retention by all the known lesions and no evidence of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. Therapeutic amounts of radioactive iodine were administered orally between May and October 1943. Definite and lasting clinical improvement followed. In April 1944 and March 1945 additional I* was administered with a resultant disappearance of pain, increase in weight, and progressive change in all clinical criteria in the direction of hypothyroidism. Roentgenographic evidence pointed to an arrest if not a regression of the disease. No untoward effects followed this therapy. Radioactive iodine seems to be an effective therapeutic agent in the control of this type of tumor.\r"

The 303 men receiving androgen blockade with leuprolide and flutamide demonstrated a longer progression-free survival (16.9 vs. 13.9 months, P = 0.039) and an increased median length of survival (35.0 vs. 27.9 months, P = 0.035). In the subgroup of men with minimal disease and good performance status, the advantages of maximal androgen blockade were more pronounced. It is concluded that combined androgen blockade with leuprolide and flutamide was more effective than leuprolide alone for patients with metastatic cancer of the prostate. The therapeutic benefits, although greatest in patients with minimum disease, need to be evaluated in a prospective, randomized fashion in trials specifically designed for men with minimal disease and good performance status. Exploratory analyses using the black race as an explanatory variable were also performed. Black race is associated with shorter survival times and is also associated with other prognostic factors, including recent weight loss, anemia, elevated phosphatase levels, and pain. These findings suggest the need for future studies of the relationship of black race and response to prostate cancer therapy.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that sympathetic neural stimulation increases the prevalence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation and explored the mechanisms by which this occurs and how it may be prevented. In anesthetized, autonomically denervated dogs, we examined the effects of bilateral ansae subclaviae stimulation (SS) and of induction of pericardial biosynthesis of prostaglandins, an intervention that reduces SS effects by acting at presynaptic sites. A 5-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery distal to the first or second diagonal branch was performed during SS. Heart rate was maintained constant by atrial pacing. In the absence of SS, one of 23 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during occlusion, and three of the remaining 22 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation upon reperfusion. SS did not increase the prevalence of occlusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (four of 23 dogs) but increased the prevalence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (12 of the remaining 19 dogs, p = 0.01). SS did not affect occlusion-induced decrease in local electrogram amplitude recorded from the ischemic myocardium or myocardial blood flow to the ischemic myocardium during occlusion or reperfusion. SS, however, prevented occlusion-induced increase in diastolic excitability threshold. Instillation into the pericardial cavity of arachidonic acid solution (3 micrograms/ml) resulted in release of prostacyclin, measured by radioimmunoassay as a stable metabolite 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (63.1 +/- 11.3 ng/ml, n = 11, mean +/- SEM), and of prostaglandin E2 (7.0 +/- 0.9 ng/ml, n = 11). This pericardial solution blunted SS-induced increase in mean arterial blood pressure and reduced the prevalence of ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion (six dogs to one dog, p less than 0.05). Blood flow to the ischemic myocardium remained unaffected. Indomethacin, when added to the solution (3 micrograms/ml), reversed the effects of prostaglandin release and arrhythmia development. These data indicate that efferent sympathetic stimulation during a coronary occlusion and reperfusion sequence increases the prevalence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation that is reduced by pericardial biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Pericardial prostaglandin synthesis may serve as a unique antiarrhythmic function by regulating efferent cardiac sympathetic nerve effects.\r"

  ".W": "LY210825, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), which contains the kringle-2 and serine protease functional domains of native tissue-type plasminogen activator, was previously produced by site-directed mutagenesis in a Syrian hamster cell line. We studied the thrombolytic potential of this molecule in a canine thrombosis model. Male hounds (16-22 kg) were anesthetized; a 2.0-cm segment of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) was isolated proximal to the first main branch, and the dogs were instrumented with an electromagnetic flow probe to measure coronary blood flow. An occlusive thrombus was formed after injury of the intimal surface of the LCX with an electrical current applied by a needle-tipped anode placed distal to the electromagnetic flow probe. After 1 hour of occlusion, either LY210825 or rt-PA was administered intravenously according to the following protocols: 1) a 1-hour infusion of either 0.25 mg/kg LY210825 or 0.4 mg/kg rt-PA, 2) single injections of 0.15-0.6 mg/kg LY210825, and 3) a single injection of 0.45 mg/kg LY210825 and a 3-hour infusion of 1.0 or 1.7 mg/kg rt-PA. Plasma half-lives of LY210825 and rt-PA were 58 +/- 7 and 3.3 +/- 0.3 minutes, respectively. LY210825 produced more rapid reperfusion of the LCX than did rt-PA. In the third study, 90% of the rt-PA-treated vessels reoccluded within 1 hour after cessation of drug, whereas only 25% of the LY210825-treated vessels reoccluded during a 4-hour washout period. There were significant, but relatively small, reductions produced by both plasminogen activators on plasma fibrinogen and plasminogen (25-35% decreases). Because of its longer plasma half-life, LY210825 could be administered intravenously as a single injection. In a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis, LY210825 was a more effective thrombolytic agent than was rt-PA.\r"

In the majority of recent clinical trials with streptokinase, a high-dose (0.7-1.5 million units), brief-duration (30-90 minutes) drug regimen has been used. After a mean interval of 4.2 hours from onset of chest pain to intravenous infusion of streptokinase, repeat angiography performed 60-90 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment gave a reperfusion rate of 43%; the corresponding figures for anistreplase, saruplase, and alteplase are 56%, 67%, and 69%. The patency rates obtained in similar studies with the same end point are 56% for streptokinase, 77% for anistreplase, 62% for urokinase, 71% for saruplase, and 75% for alteplase. The in-hospital mortality in randomized trials (six large studies in a total of 31,713 randomized patients) with intravenous high-dose streptokinase decreased from 12.0% in the control group to 9.47% in the streptokinase group. In a mortality study involving 1,258 patients randomized to intravenous anistreplase or placebo, the 30-day mortality was reduced by 47%, from 12.2% to 6.4%. In a large trial in which 5,011 patients were randomized to alteplase or placebo, the 30-day mortality was 7.2% compared with 9.8% in controls, a reduction of 27% by alteplase. In another trial, 721 patients were randomized to placebo or alteplase; all patients received acetylsalicylic acid and intravenous heparin. The 14-day mortality was only 2.8% in the alteplase group, 51% less than that in the control group. It is most important that the favorable impact on hospital survival be maintained at 1 year for any thrombolytic drug. Large-scale trials directly comparing mortality after alteplase, streptokinase, or anistreplase are being performed or are in the planning phase. The risk of bleeding exists with any thrombolytic agent; intracranial bleeding is the most serious risk. In a large trial in 5,011 patients with acute myocardial infarction, stroke occurred in 1.1% of alteplase-treated patients compared with 1.0% in placebo-treated controls. Haunting problems are residual stenosis of the coronary artery and reocclusion. Urgent angioplasty does not seem to be the right answer; more effective antithrombotic strategies have yet to be developed.\r"

  ".W": "The most prominent effect of propane-2, 2-diphosphonate (PDP) and ethane-1-hydroxy-1, 1-diphosphonate (EHDP) on matrix-induced ectopic bone in the rat was a dose-dependent inhibition of osteogenesis in the early phases of development. The delay was seen as a consequence of osteoprogenitor cell inhibition. Additionally, later phases of bone maturation were disturbed by interference with the mineralization and remodeling processes. However, direct effects on the calcium phosphates of bone are only of minor additional value, which remains of lesser importance in comparison to the cellular impairment. After withdrawal of diphosphonates, the effects were nearly completely remitted. Neither PDP nor EHDP, even given in high doses, resulted in a lasting reduction in ectopic mass. The remission may be referred to the recovery of cell activities, whereas the mineral impregnation of osteoidosis was, if at all, of little importance. For treatment of ectopic osteogenesis PDP proved inefficient.\r"

  ".W": "In rabbits, after long-bone growth is complete and the cambium layer regresses, mesenchymal-type cells with embryonic potential (competence) for bone development persist in the adventitial layer of periosteum. These cells are not determined osteoprogenitor cells (stem cells) because bone tissue differentiation does not occur when adult periosteum is transplanted into a heterotopic site. In this respect, adventitial cells differ from bone marrow stroma cells. In a parosteal orthotopic site in the space between the adult periosteum and diaphysis, implants of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and associated noncollagenous proteins (BMP/NCP) induce adventitia and adjacent muscle connective-tissue-derived cells to switch from a fibrogenetic to a chondroosteoprogenetic pattern of bone development. The quantity of induced bone is proportional to the dose of BMP/NCP in the range from 10 to 50 mg; immature rabbits produced larger deposits than mature rabbits in response to BMP/NCP. Preoperative local intramuscular injections of citric, edetic, or hyaluronic acids in specified concentrations markedly enhanced subperiosteal BMP/NCP-induced bone formation. The quantity of bovine or human BMP/NCP-induced bone formation in rabbits is also increased by very low-dose immunosuppression but not by bone mineral, tricalcium phosphate ceramic, inorganic calcium salts, or various space-occupying, unspecific chemical irritants. Although composities of BMP/NCP and allogeneic rabbit tendon collagen increased the quantity of bone in a parosteal site, in a heterotopic site the composite failed to induce bone formation. In a parosteal site, the conditions permitting BMP/NCP-induced bone formation develop, and the end product of the morphogenetic response is a duplicate diaphysis. How BMP reactivates the morphogenetic process in postfetal mesenchymal-type adventitial cells persisting in adult periosteum (including adjacent muscle attachments) is not known.\r"

In addition, measurements of clinical status (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II]) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were correlated with adrenal status. Critically ill patients were subdivided into normal (greater than 2) and subnormal (less than 2) Aldo-to-PRA ratio (Aldo/PRA). Patients with basal Aldo less than 70 ng/dl exhibited subnormal Aldo responses to ACTH, regardless of basal Aldo/PRA. However, normal responses to MCP were noted regardless of basal Aldo/PRA. No correlation between Aldo/PRA and APACHE II score or ANP levels was found. We conclude that critically ill patients with dissociated Aldo and renin can generate a normal Aldo response to MCP. This suggests that this syndrome is due to functional and potentially reversible dysfunction of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.\r"

In these patients the incidence of significant infection was compared with the infection rate in 12 similar patients with SCARRF who had not received SDD, treated over the preceding 12 months. Both groups were comparable for age, study period, sepsis score, and therapeutic intervention scoring system on admission, although the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was higher (p less than .05) in the SDD-treated group. Ten (83%) of 12 control patients developed definable infections compared with five (33%) of 15 in the SDD group (p less than .05). Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were responsible for 14 of the 17 infections affecting ten control patients, compared with six of the seven infections in only four SDD patients (p less than .05). The most notable site to benefit was the respiratory tract, with only one patient in the SDD group developing a pulmonary infection compared with five in the control patients (p less than .05). Urine infections may have been reduced from six (50%) of the 12 control patients to two (13%) of the 15 SDD patients, but this difference was not significant. Although survival in the control and SDD group was comparable (42% vs. 40%), mortality overall seemed related to infection. Eleven (73%) of 15 patients with definite infection died, in contrast with five (42%) of 12 who had no infections, although this was not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When we separated the patients into those with rales and those without, Dsb correlated strongly with EF only in those with rales. There was no correlation with other spirometric values. Mean Dsb percent predicted was significantly lower in patients with rales despite similar mean EF. Only two of 23 patients without rales had a reduced Dsb while only one of 11 with rales had a normal Dsb. We conclude that Dsb is a good predictor of clinically evident heart failure. When rales are absent, Dsb should be normal in patients with LV dysfunction; when present, Dsb will be diminished in proportion to the EF.\r"

Continuous negative extrathoracic pressure ventilation induced a transient increase in plasma ANP level, but changes in plasma ANP level were not statistically significant. Although there was no significant difference in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion among three successive periods, a slight but significant increase in creatinine clearance was noticed during CNETPV. These results indicate that CNETPV with continuous negative extrathoracic pressure of -10 cm H2O does not induce the major change in ANP secretion and renal function in normal subjects.\r"

A simple respiratory alkalosis was the most common acid-base disturbance, occurring in 48 percent of the episodes. Metabolic acidosis, either alone or as part of a mixed disturbance, was noted in 28 percent. Of 60 episodes presenting with respiratory acidosis, 37 (62 percent) had a coexistent metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis was more likely to occur in male subjects and in patients with evidence of more severe airflow obstruction. Patients with metabolic acidosis had an average anion gap of 15.8 mEq/L; these patients were more hypoxemic than those without metabolic acidosis and there was a significant inverse correlation between the anion gap and the degree of hypoxemia. We conclude that metabolic acidosis is a common finding in acute, severe asthma and suggest that the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis is multifactorial and includes contributions from lactate production by respiratory muscles, tissue hypoxia, and intracellular alkalosis.\r"

  ".W": "Mechanically ventilated, nonsurgical, critically ill patients represent a group not rigorously studied by energy expenditure measurements for formulating nutritional support guidelines. Most strategies for predicting caloric requirements in this group are based on studies of spontaneously breathing surgical patients. It is unclear whether \"severity of disease\" or \"stress\" factors employed in this group are justifiable in medical patients with compromised pulmonary function, who may be particularly prone to the complications of overfeeding. We therefore measured the energy expenditures of 73 consecutive ventilator-supported patients with various primary diagnoses in a medical ICU. These results are compared to estimates of caloric requirements based on the Harris-Benedict equations, without modification for severity of disease or other factors. These comparisons are (kcal/day +/- SE, measured vs predicted): sepsis, 1,982 +/- 97 vs 1,534 +/- 56 (p less than 0.0001); cardiogenic shock, 1,452 +/- 119 vs 1,339 +/- 62; cardiogenic pulmonary edema, 1,427 +/- 87 vs 1,338 +/- 93; ARDS, 1,732 +/- 203 vs 1,550 +/- 125; pneumonia, 1,508 +/- 148 vs 1,259 +/- 55; and \"other\" 1,585 +/- 104 vs 1,419 +/- 55. These data reveal that in mechanically ventilated nonsurgical patients without sepsis, no modifications of the Harris-Benedict equations are necessary; in those with sepsis an increase of approximately 20 percent over these predictions is appropriate.\r"

All patients experienced a rapid reduction in airway pressures, CO2 retention, and resolution of acidosis while breathing a helium-oxygen mixture. There were no untoward effects. Helium-oxygen mixtures improve ventilation by reducing the Reynolds number and reducing density dependent resistance. Helium's beneficial effects are due to its high kinematic viscosity, high binary diffusion coefficient for CO2, and high diffusivity. Helium-oxygen mixtures should be considered for use in mechanically ventilated asthmatics with respiratory acidosis who fail conventional therapy.\r"

Serial bleedings were obtained from 23 chimpanzees that had been experimentally infected with an isolate of hepatitis C virus, originally recovered from contaminated lots of factor VIII (antihemophilic) materials. Sera were assayed for the presence of antihepatitis C virus by a newly developed radioimmunoassay procedure that incorporated recombinant DNA-expressed viral antigen as a reagent. Twenty-one of 23 hepatitis C virus infected animals were shown to acquire antihepatitis C virus, most within 2-8 weeks after the major peak of alanine aminotransferase activity. All chimpanzees with biochemical, electron microscopic, and histological evidence of chronic disease clearly acquired antibody; 14 of 16 animals observed through the acute phase of disease were also shown to acquire antibody. A booster effect or anamnestic response was noted in two chimpanzees (one of which was negative for antihepatitis C virus following the acute phase of disease) after challenge with hepatitis C virus. Antihepatitis C virus was not neutralizing, because some animals with high levels of antibody were also shown to have high titers of circulating hepatitis C virus. The development and maintenance of anti-hepatitis C virus appears to reflect concomitant virus replication and high potential for infectivity.\r"

In vivo perfusion of the colon in Sprague-Dawley rats was used to measure Na+, K+, Cl-, and water transport, while atrial natriuretic factor was infused into the jugular vein at 0.5 or 1.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. In vitro experiments in Ussing chambers measured short-circuit current and ion fluxes before and after atrial natriuretic factor administration. Because cyclic guanosine monophosphate is thought to be a second messenger for atrial natriuretic factor, short-circuit current was also determined before and after exposure to 8-Br-cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor (atriopeptin III) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The in vivo transport of water, sodium, and chloride and the secretion of potassium were not altered by atrial natriuretic factor infusion. In vitro studies showed no change in Na+ or Cl- transport or change in short-circuit current. Plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations increased from 139 +/- 55 pg/mL to 1385 +/- 396 pg/mL during infusion, and urine output increased from 12.6 +/- 0.5 microL/min to 37.4 +/- 2.9 microL/min (P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Acinar cells are one of the best studied models of exocytotic secretion. A number of different hormones and neurotransmitters interact with specific membrane receptors, and it is commonly held that pancreatic secretagogues stimulate enzyme release via the elevation of either cytosolic free Ca2+ or cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The discovery of the pivotal role played by phospholipid metabolism in the chain of events leading to secretion, together with the introduction of sensitive techniques to monitor cytosolic free Ca2+, has generated a series of studies that have challenged this classical model. Thus, several observations in pancreatic acini as well as other cell types have argued against the notion that a generalized increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ represents a sufficient and necessary stimulus for exocytosis in nonexcitable cells. Furthermore, the demonstration that a single agonist activates multiple transduction pathways has served to refute the schematic view that receptor agonists activate only one second messenger system. The aim of this article is to review the recent advances in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of signal transduction, with particular emphasis on the inositol lipid pathway, and to integrate this information into a new working model of enzyme secretion from acinar cells.\r"

Subjects were studied in a random order, single-blind study on two occasions, each 48 hours in length, when they were given UK 79300 (25 or 50 mg p.o.) or placebo at 12-hour intervals (each agent for 24 hours). The endopeptidase inhibitor enhanced plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor in association with suppression of both plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations. Twenty-four-hour urinary excretion of sodium was doubled by UK 79300, and the urinary excretion rates of phosphorus, atrial natriuretic factor immunoreactivity, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate were also significantly enhanced, whereas urinary aldosterone excretion was halved. The profile of biological effects closely paralleled those previously reported with low dose infusions of atrial natriuretic factor in humans and animals.

A fusion gene comprising the mouse transthyretin promoter and mouse atrial natriuretic factor structural sequences was designed so as to target hormone expression to the liver. Hepatic expression of atrial natriuretic factor was detectable as early as embryonic day 15 in transgenic animals. In adult transgenic mice, plasma immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor concentration was elevated at least eightfold as compared with nontransgenic littermates. The mean arterial pressure of conscious transgenic mice was 75.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, significantly less than that of nontransgenic siblings (103.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg). This difference in mean arterial pressure was not accompanied by significant changes in several other physiological parameters, including heart rate, plasma and urinary electrolytes, water intake, and urine volume. This study demonstrates that a chronic elevation of plasma atrial natriuretic factor decreases arterial blood pressure without inducing diuresis and natriuresis in transgenic mice and also illustrates the value of the transgenic approach for the study of the cardiovascular system.\r"

Because the CD11/CD18 glycoprotein family on the surface membrane of neutrophils participates in many adhesive interactions with the endothelium, we investigated the role of these proteins in the intravascular sequestration of pulmonary neutrophils. Neutrophils were isolated from normal dogs and from the only living dog known to have leukocyte adhesion deficiency disease, an inherited deficiency of the CD11/CD18 adhesion family. The neutrophils were labeled with fluorescein dye, injected into normal recipient dogs, and their passage through the pulmonary microcirculation was recorded by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy through a transparent thoracic window. Transit times for normal and deficient neutrophils were similar over a wide range of hemo-dynamic conditions. Activation by zymosan-activated plasma, which increases the surface membrane expression of CD11/CD18, prolonged the transit of normal neutrophils but did not alter the transit time of the deficient neutrophils. These results indicate that neutrophil CD11/CD18 adhesion-promoting glycoproteins are not involved in the normal pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils but have a significant role in the arrest of activated neutrophils in the pulmonary capillaries.\r"

Because of the known membrane-stabilizing effects of cromolyn and the resultant inhibition of mediator production, we hypothesized a role for the products of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism in these events. We exposed five adult male baboons to 0.5 ppm ozone on two occasions, once with cromolyn pretreatment and once without. Pulmonary resistance (RL) was monitored and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed before and after each exposure. The BAL was analyzed for a stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin, 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha, PGE2, a stable hydrolysis product of thromboxane (Tx) A2, TxB2, and PGF2 alpha. RL increased after ozone exposure (1.62 +/- 0.23 to 3.77 +/- 0.51 cmH2O.l-1.s, difference 2.15; P less than 0.02), and this effect was partially blocked by cromolyn (1.93 +/- 0.09 to 3.18 +/- 0.40 cmH2O.l-1.s, difference 1.25; P less than 0.02). The base-line levels of the metabolites of AA in the BAL were as follows (in pg/ml): 6-keto-PGF1 alpha 72.78 +/- 12.6, PGE2 145.92 +/- 30.52, TxB2 52.52 +/- 9.56, and PGF2 alpha 22.28 +/- 5.42. Ozone exposure had no effect on the level of any of these prostanoids (P = NS). These studies quantify the magnitude of cyclooxygenase products of AA metabolism in BAL from baboon lungs and demonstrate that changes in the levels of these mediators in BAL are not prerequisites for ozone-induced increases in respiratory resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To reexamine the previously reported augmentation of histamine constriction induced by the inhibitors and the antagonists, we compared the active tension of the muscle measured from the maximum relaxed level as the base line to eliminate the fluctuation of inherent tone. Such comparison revealed that the inhibitors and the antagonists have no augmentative effect on either the maximum response to histamine or the concentration required to produce 50% of maximum active tension and that there is functional synergism between the exogenously added histamine and the endogenously produced AA metabolites. Therefore the zero active tension is useful as a base line to compare the contractile response of a drug-treated preparation with that of a nontreated preparation.\r"

DAMP greater than PZ greater than AFDX-116 decreased base-line phrenic activity and the CO2 response slope. Many injections had no effect, and some affected only one variable. The injection sites were within 700 microns of the VLM surface extending from the caudal aspect of the superior olive through a region ventromedial to the facial nucleus to the rostral aspect of the inferior olive. In a small number of experiments the response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation was affected by some injections of each antagonist.

After OA only, a progressive decrease in rPBF occurred in edematous gravity-dependent lung regions, but only in 6 of 11 dogs. In these six dogs, rPBF fell 41 +/- 12% compared with base line or with the other five dogs (3 +/- 19%) (P less than 0.05). In the NP/Prost group, the vasodilators failed to reverse any change in rPBF after OA but did prevent additional derecruitment until the drug infusion was stopped, after which rPBF to the edematous regions decreased further. In contrast, meclofenamate after OA temporally accelerated but did not quantitatively enhance rPBF reduction in edematous lung regions. Thus, in this model, vessels in edematous lung regions remain vasoreactive only until derecruited. We speculate that the mechanism of derecruitment involves an interaction between edema accumulation and vasoconstriction, in which the actual pattern of rPBF after lung injury represents a balance between mechanisms responsible for vascular derecruitment and vasodilation from prostacyclin production.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of reduced muscle oxidative capacity on peak oxygen consumption and isometric performance was evaluated using an isolated rat hindlimb preparation perfused with a high oxygen delivery. Capacity for electron transport was reduced with chloramphenicol (CAP), an inhibitor of mitochondrial gene-coded protein synthesis. The activity of cytochrome oxidase, a mitochondrial cristae component, was reduced approximately 45% (P less than 0.005) in the mixed-fiber-type plantaris muscle. Several facets of muscle remodeling were also evident with the 10- to 14-day CAP treatment, including decreased citrate synthase activity, increased capillarity, and increased numbers of type IIc fibers. Perfusion of CAP (n = 6) and control (n = 7) rat hindlimbs of similar size with similar total flows (10-11 ml/min) and oxygen contents (20-21 vol%) resulted in similarly high oxygen deliveries to contracting muscles of the hindlimbs (CAP, 9.66 +/- 0.83 mumols.min-1.g-1; control, 8.74 +/- 0.75). Performance of the gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus group declined in a similar fashion for both groups during increasingly intense near-steady-state tetanic contraction (100 ms at 100 Hz) conditions of 4, 8, 15, 30, 45, and 60 per minute. Oxygen consumption was similar for both groups at rest and increased similarly at each contraction condition. Peak oxygen consumption was not different between CAP (5.34 +/- 0.55 mumols.min-1.g-1) and control (5.74 +/- 0.43) groups and required only 56-68% of the oxygen delivered. This implies that rat skeletal muscle can suffer a significant reduction in its electron transport capacity without impairing peak oxygen consumption and muscle performance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit GH secretion in normal man when acutely and chronically administered in pharmacological amounts. Pyridostigmine (PD), an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is able to elicit GH secretion when administered alone and to enhance the GH response to GHRH in normal subjects probably via a decrease in the hypothalamic release of somatostatin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of glucocorticoids on the GH response to PD administered either alone or in combination with GHRH in normal adult subjects. Six healthy adult volunteers underwent six experimental protocols. They received 1) human (h) GHRH(1-29)NH2, 100 micrograms injected as an iv bolus; 2) cortisone acetate, 50 mg administered orally (po) 60 min before an hGHRH iv bolus injection; 3) PD, 120 mg administered po, 60 min before an hGHRH iv bolus injection; 4) PD and cortisone acetate, administered po 60 min before an hGHRH iv bolus injection; 5) PD, administered po 60 min before a saline iv bolus injection; 6) PD and cortisone acetate administered po 60 min before a saline iv bolus injection. Mean GH levels, peak GH levels, and GH area under the curves (AUCs) were significantly lower after GHRH + cortisone as compared to GHRH alone. However, these parameters were not significantly different after PD + GHRH + cortisone when compared to PD + GHRH and after PD + cortisone when compared to PD alone. We conclude that acute administration of pharmacological amounts of glucocorticoids cannot inhibit the GH response to PD alone or in combination with GHRH. Thus, we hypothesize that the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on the GH response to GHRH in man may be mediated by an enhancement of either somatostatin release by the hypothalamus or somatostatin action on the pituitary.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-four GH secretory patterns were studied before and during continuous infusions of GHRH in six patients with active acromegaly and in six normal adult men. GH release was episodic in both groups. Control subjects showed a normal diurnal variation in GH release, with the majority of GH released at night (2200-0800 h); mean levels were 1.5 +/- 0.4 (SE) ng/mL (day) and 4.2 +/- 0.8 ng/mL (night). Acromegalics had no diurnal variation in GH; levels were 45.3 +/- 13.7 ng/mL (day) and 39.8 +/- 12.2 ng/mL (night). Acromegalics demonstrated an increased frequency of GH pulses compared to normals (11.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.3/24 h). During continuous 24-h infusions of GHRH, the normal subjects continued to show a diurnal variation in GH release, but GH pulse frequency increased to a rate (11.7 +/- 1.4 pulses/24 h) very similar to that of the patients with acromegaly. In contrast, GHRH infusion did not alter the GH pulse frequency in the acromegalics. GHRH increased the mean levels of GH in both groups (patients 80.2 +/- 20.3 vs. 41.0 +/- 12.1 ng/mL, x +/- SE. P less than 0.05; controls 10.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 3.33 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, P less than 0.01). Some of the patients with acromegaly showed a progressive decline in GH levels during the infusion period, suggesting desensitization or exhaustion of releaseable stores; however, GH levels remained above basal values in all patients. After the 24-h GHRH infusions, the GH response to a bolus of GHRH was diminished in the normal subjects (2.1 +/- 0.9 vs. 16.8 +/- 5 ng/mL, x +/- SE; P less than 0.01) but not in the acromegalic patients (30.2 +/- 8.9 vs. 35.5 +/- 12.5 ng/mL; NS). These results indicate that GH release is episodic under basal conditions and during continuous GHRH infusion in both acromegalic and normal subjects, indicating the importance of other modulators of GH release, such as somatostatin, which may remain pulsatile even in acromegaly.\r"

  ".W": "Several molecular forms of immunoreactive human (h) PRL with differences in biological activities have been described. To investigate these differences in PRL secretion, we have characterized the molecular forms of circulating PRL in postpartum women during breastfeeding (n = 5) and sleep (n = 5) and in eumenorrheic women with galactorrhea (n = 5) after TRH stimulation (n = 4), metaclopramide infusion (n = 5), and morphine administration (n = 2). All provocative testing in eumenorrheic women were carried out during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (days 1-5). PRL variants were identified and semiquantitated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting and autoradiography. Mean basal levels of PRL were significantly elevated in nursing women (P less than 0.01) compared to those in nonlactating postpartum women and women with galactorrhea. The relative proportions of PRL variants [glycosylated PRL with an apparent mol wt of 25K and a nonglycosylated species (hPRL) with an apparent mol wt of 23 K] were similar for all three groups. A third immunoreactive PRL variant with an apparent mol wt of 21K was identified in nonlactating postpartum women. With breastfeeding or sleep, PRL concentrations increased more than 4-fold and were accompanied by a shift toward the lower mol wt, nonglycosylated species. In response to TRH (200 micrograms, iv), PRL levels increased by 493 +/- 86% (mean +/- SE) over basal levels. This acute release of PRL was positively correlated (r = 0.06074; P less than 0.001) with a significant increase in secretion of the hPRL species (P less than 0.05). During metaclopramide infusion, a similar increment in hPRL was observed during acute PRL release. Administration of the opiate agonist morphine was associated with a small increment in PRL release and did not alter the proportions of PRL variants in the circulation. Because glycosylation is a posttranslational step in the processing of PRL, our studies suggest that the acute release of PRL in response to physiological and pharmacological secretagogues may reflect the output of more recently synthesized PRL from the pituitary. The physiological role of the 21K PRL species remains to be determined.\r"

We studied the effects of GnRH, CRF, dexamethasone, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on FSH and LH secretion and on FSH beta and chromogranin-A and -B mRNA expression in 10 chromogranin-A-positive adenomas in vitro to analyze the regulation of FSH and chromogranin-A and -B expression in these neoplasms. Most adenomas responded to GnRH stimulation during 7 days in culture with a 2- to 10-fold increase in FSH and LH secretion and a 2- to 7-fold increase in FSH beta mRNA compared to control values. CRF and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulated FSH and LH secretion 2- to 5-fold in five of seven and three of three cases, respectively, during 7 days in culture. Dexamethasone stimulated both FSH and LH secretion in two of three cases as well as FSH beta mRNA in vitro in the one case examined. GnRH treatment consistently produced a 2-fold increase in chromogranin-B mRNA, but not in chromogranin-A mRNA, after 7 days of culture. These results indicate that many chromogranin-A-positive adenomas respond to GnRH and CRF in vitro by increased hormone secretion and that GnRH stimulation leads to increased amounts of FSH beta and chromogranin-B mRNAs. The differential response of chromogranin-A and -B mRNAs after GnRH stimulation indicates that the chromogranin genes are highly regulated in these tumors.\r"

  ".U": "90368869\r", 
  ".W": "TSH secretion, with particular regard to the nocturnal surge of the hormone, was evaluated in 15 women (age range, 35-66 yr; mean, 50 yr) with untreated major endogenous depression and 15 healthy women (age range, 32-67 yr; mean, 53 yr) using an ultrasensitive assay. Mean morning (0830 h) TSH values did not differ in the 2 groups (1.3 +/- 02 mU/L in depressives and 1.4 +/- 0.1 mU/L in controls), whereas mean nighttime (2400-0200 h) values were significantly reduced in depressives (1.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3 mU/L; P less than 0.0005). At variance with the control group, morning and nighttime TSH values did not differ in the depressives. The nocturnal serum TSH surge was abolished in 14 of 15 depressed patients. The mean peak TSH value after TRH was slightly yet significantly lower in the depressives. Patients with subnormal (less than 0.4 mU/L) TSH values in the morning had a serum TSH increase after TRH less than 2 mU/L in 5 of 6 cases and a lack of the nocturnal TSH surge in 6 of 6. Among the 9 patients with normal TSH values in the morning, the nocturnal serum TSH surge was lost in 8 of 9, whereas the response to TRH was normal in all. The depressives, at variance with other reports, showed significantly lower values of total and free thyroid hormones. Mean serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and ferritin were also significantly reduced. In conclusion, major endogenous depression is associated with a major impairment of TSH secretion, which baseline TSH measurements in the morning and the evaluation of the TSH response to TRH may not reveal. In this regard, the loss of the nocturnal serum TSH rise would appear to be a more sensitive indicator of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis alterations in depressives than the TRH test, which is commonly used in the evaluation of these patients. The lack of the nocturnal TSH surge may be responsible for the reduced thyroid hormone secretion and supports the case for some degree of central hypothyroidism in endogenous depression.\r"

  ".W": "It is now well established that during the second half of normal pregnancy, the human placenta secretes its specific GH variant (placental GH) in increasing amounts up to delivery. During the same period, pituitary GH secretion is progressively suppressed. The present study was aimed at clarifying the physiology of GH secretion in pregnant acromegalic women. Two young women remained acromegalic despite transphenoidal removal of their pituitary adenoma. Increased basal levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as well as paradoxical GH release after TRH injection were noted. Both women became pregnant and delivered term babies without any complication. In both patients, pituitary GH remained elevated during the entire pregnancy, contrary to the situation in normal women. Paradoxical GH release after TRH treatment was also present, whereas no response was observed in five normal control subjects. GH pulsatility studies revealed a highly pulsatile secretory pattern of pituitary GH, in contrast to that in normal woman, whose placental GH is secreted tonically. Tissue placental GH concentrations were within the range of levels in normal placentas. An increase in serum IGF-I in late pregnancy was also similar to that observed in normal pregnancy. These findings confirm that increased IGF-I levels are not pituitary GH dependent in late pregnancy. They add new evidence that adenomatous somatotrophs lack an IGF-I-dependent feedback regulation present in normal somatotrophs.\r"

Inhibin levels were determined by bioassay (BA) and RIA; AIA was measured by BA. The inhibin content of follicles characterized as immature by their estradiol (E2) levels and E2/progesterone (P) ratios was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) than that of mature follicles (i.e. leading to pregnancy). The mean AIA for mature follicles were significantly lower than AIA in groups where pregnancy was not obtained. AIA for follicles from which a pregnancy was obtained for each ET was also significantly lower than that in FF characterized as immature of hypermature. The highest E2/AIA and inhibin BA/AIA ratios were associated with the highest incidence of successful IVF ET outcome. No correlation was found between AIA and inhibin, on the one hand, and E2, delta 4-androstenedione, E2/P, and PRL, on the other. However, a positive correlation was found between inhibin (RIA and BA) and P, reflecting the production of inhibin by granulosa cells during luteinization. These studies allowed us to conclude that FF inhibin levels do not differ according to IVF ET outcome, but are an index of follicular maturation. AIA not only constitutes an index of follicular maturation and granulosa cell luteinization, but is of predictive value for IVF ET outcome as E2/AIA and inhibin BA/AIA ratios.\r"

The subjects with CETP deficiency have increased levels of apolipoprotein (apo) E. The increased concentration of apo E in these subjects was correlated to the appearance of apo E-rich high density lipoproteins (HDL). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed that these lipoproteins contained predominantly the apo E (82%) and little amount of apo A-I (18%). These apo E-rich HDL displayed a much higher affinity than human LDL in binding to LDL receptors on human fibroblasts. Furthermore, 3.5 times fewer apo E-rich HDL than LDL were required to saturate the receptors on fibroblasts. These data indicated that the apo E-rich HDL in CETP-deficient human subjects contained multiple copies of apo E and bound to the LDL receptor through multiple interactions. The apo E-rich HDL, with similar properties as cholesterol-induced apo E HDLc, were not detectable in normal human subjects or in hyperalphalipoproteinemic subjects with normal CETP activity. The apo E-containing HDL in the latter subjects were smaller and contained only small amounts of apo E (14%). The difference in apo E-containing HDL in these subjects suggests a correlation between CETP level and the appearance of apo E-rich HDL.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with unknown cause characterized by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Although an autoimmune pathogenesis has been suggested, there are no conclusive data on the number of T cells autoreactive with myelin antigens in MS compared to controls. We showed that T lymphocytes secreting interferon-gamma in response to possible target autoantigens are severalfold more common among PBL mononuclear cells in patients with MS than in patients with aseptic meningitis and tension headache. On average T cells reactive with myelin basic protein (MBP), two different MBP peptides, or with proteolipid protein amounted to 2.7-5.2/10(5) PBL from MS patients. MBP-reactive T cells were still more frequent among mononuclear cells isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; 185/10(5) CSF cells). We concluded that T cells reactive with myelin autoantigens are strongly increased in MS. This approach to detect them could allow definition of immunodominant T cell epitopes in individual MS patients, and thereby enable further development towards specific immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we explored whether informally or formally provided long-term care services reduce the risk of institutionalization among the impaired elderly and the nature of the relationship between support and risk. We relied principally on the 1982 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS) with supplementary data from the 1984 NLTCS and the national American Housing Survey. Five specific types of effects were tested: direct effects of formal and informal care on institutional risk; buffering effects of support moderating risk factors; supplementation effects of formal support on the risk-reducing impact of informal care; facilitating effects of the housing environment in enabling support to continue; and intervening effects mediating the direct effects. The effects of each type of support differ substantially. The analyses do not confirm the notion that formal, paid care reduces institutional risk. In fact, the use of paid caregivers is associated with greater risk of institutionalization, other things equal. The results for informal care are more mixed. A general measure that accounts for all types of informal support has no effect on institutional risk in any of the formulations tested. But the marginally significant effects of quality and proximate support in the direct effects model are consistent with the hypothesis that caregiving reduces institutional risk. The findings also indicate that a small number of housing or locational features are facilitators of formal support and particular types of informal support.\r"

During the TRH infusion the gonadotropin responses to acute GnRH stimulation were higher than in the saline control period but, although statistically significant, the differences were small in magnitude and were similar to the intraindividual coefficient of variation in gonadotropin responses determined under control conditions. They did not appear to be of clinical significance. TRH significantly lengthened the interval between GnRH administration and the appearance of peak gonadotropin levels. These results indicate that a brief TRH infusion, producing mild elevations of thyrotropin and prolactin, causes slight alterations predominantly in the timing of GnRH-stimulated gonadotropin secretion.\r"

The role of xanthine oxidase in inflammatory cell populations has not been defined. We examined the level of xanthine oxidase activity expressed by murine leukocytes both in the resting state, and after in vivo and in vitro exposure to inflammatory stimuli. The contribution of xanthine oxidase to inflammation may vary among tissue compartments, so leukocytes harvested from several tissues were studied. Resident murine peritoneal macrophages consistently expressed xanthine oxidase activity (291 +/- 55 microIU/10(6) cells). Thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages contained similar levels of xanthine oxidase activity (265 +/- 42 microIU/10(6) cells). By contrast, resident murine alveolar macrophages expressed one tenth the xanthine oxidase activity (24 +/- 4 microIU/10(6) cells). Xanthine oxidase activity was also consistently found in murine peritoneal neutrophils (127 +/- 28 microIU/10(6) cells) but not in splenic lymphocytes. In vitro studies were performed to determine whether xanthine oxidase activity of resident peritoneal macrophages could be modulated by exogenous stimuli relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide caused a 62% +/- 9% reduction in cellular xanthine oxidase activity (p less than 0.02). Interferon-gamma alone had no effect on xanthine oxidase activity; however, interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide together caused a striking reduction in cellular xanthine oxidase activity, reaching 25% +/- 2% of unstimulated control cells (p less than 0.001). We conclude that murine macrophages and neutrophils are potentially important sources of xanthine oxidase activity in inflamed tissues. In addition, the activity of xanthine oxidase in macrophages is tissue specific and is modulated in vitro by proinflammatory stimuli.\r"

  ".W": "In pentobarbital anesthetized cats, i.v. bolus injections of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 1 microgram) and ET-3 (3 micrograms) produced a rapidly appearing but short-lasting fall in aortic blood pressure followed in the case of ET-1 only by a small pressor response. When these peptides were administered repeatedly after 10- to 12-min intervals, there was a gradual attenuation of the hypotension that by the fourth injection was replaced by a monophasic pressor response. The i.v. infusion of ET-1 (0.3 microgram/min) or ET-3 (0.9 microgram/min) for 20 min produced sole systemic vasoconstriction. The decrease in blood pressure produced by an i.v. bolus injection of ET-1 and ET-3 was no longer observed 5 min after the end of the ET-1 or ET-3 infusion. In contrast, the hypotensive activity of bradykinin was not modified after the depressor responses to ET-1 and ET-3 had disappeared. Thus, the failure of i.v. bolus injections of ET-1 and ET-3 to lower blood pressure under these experimental conditions cannot be attributed to the development of tachyphylaxis to endogenous endothelium-derived relaxant factor, which is known to mediate the effects of bradykinin. These results suggest that ET-1 and ET-3 share a single vascular receptor for vasodilation, which becomes refractory upon repeated or maintained exposure to these peptides. Alternatively, this refractoriness may be due to depletion of an intracellular mediator(s) that is jointly used by the membrane binding sites of ET-1 and ET-3. Moreover, the present data suggest that the vasodilator activity of ETs depends on the rate of the peptide administration.\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of i.v. cocaine on basal levels of prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone were examined in nine female rhesus monkeys during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (days 4-7). Integrated plasma samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 40 min before and 110 min after administration of cocaine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg i.v.). Cocaine plasma levels averaged 105 +/- 19 and 157 +/- 23 ng/ml after low- and high-dose administration. PRL decreased significantly (P less than .01) after cocaine administration and reached a nadir within 60 to 70 min. Inasmuch as cocaine blocks dopamine reuptake, PRL suppression is consistent with dopaminergic inhibitory control of PRL release from the pituitary. However, cocaine's effects on PRL were biphasic in 10 of 18 studies. PRL increased within 90 to 110 min post-cocaine and sometimes exceeded base-line levels by over 100%. The duration of PRL suppression (80 min) and the time of onset of the subsequent rebound PRL increase corresponds to the estimated half-life of i.v. cocaine in monkey plasma. PRL suppression followed by a rebound elevation also is consistent with clinical reports of hyperprolactinemia in chronic cocaine abusers. LH increased significantly (P less than .01) within 20 min after cocaine administration and remained above base-line for 40 to 50 min. Follicle-stimulating hormone did not change significantly after cocaine administration. Cocaine's stimulation of LH is consistent with cocaine's alleged enhancement of sexual arousal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Conditions that increased internal sodium also increased sensitivity of transport to ethanol, whereas low-sodium medium had the opposite effect. Ethanol also blocked the stimulation of ouabain-sensitive transport, glucose uptake and hyperpolarization associated with sodium influx. Low calcium decreased, while the calcium ionophore A23187 increased, sensitivity to ethanol. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration or incubation under anaerobic conditions increased sensitivity of transport to inhibition by ethanol, but did not prevent the effect of A23187. Consistent with increased sensitivity to ethanol by cell calcium, ethanol potentiated the inhibition of transport by A23187. Although transport under basal conditions does not appear very sensitive to ethanol, these data suggest that sensitivity to ethanol may be increased under conditions associated with increased neural activity, and that ethanol may reduce the transport response to electrical activity.\r"

To document this interaction further, specific behavioral responses of rats to tryptamine and apomorphine were studied. The sequential injection of these agonists, at time intervals with minimal direct behavioral interference, was used to observe response changes with respect to a single challenge. The antagonists haloperidol, ritanserin and risperidone, with known actions on serotonin-S2 (5-HT2) and dopamine-D2 (D2) receptors were used to evaluate effective antagonism of single and sequential challenges. When tryptamine was preceded by an apomorphine challenge the effective doses of the 5-HT2 antagonists ritanserin and risperidone for 50% inhibition of the seizures increased by a factor of 2.5. The dose-response curve of haloperidol remained virtually unchanged, apparently because of the potent dopamine-D2 antagonism associated with these doses which may block the potentiating effect of apomorphine. When apomorphine was preceded by a tryptamine challenge, the total agitation score of the control animals increased by 59% on the average. Haloperidol was equally effective against the enhanced as against the unenhanced apomorphine response. Ritanserin reduced agitation only by the part corresponding to the tryptamine enhancement. Risperidone's activity against the enhanced agitation started at very low doses and was complete at a dose still about 2.5 times lower than that required against the single apomorphine challenge. Mutual enhancement of tryptamine and apomorphine appears to occur even at a time when the behavioral effects of the first agonist are no longer manifest. The enhanced agitation remains largely dopamine-D2-specific and the enhanced seizures serotonin 5-HT2-specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Background. Although colony-stimulating factors have been shown to accelerate recovery from severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, their use in acute leukemia has been controversial because in vitro they stimulate leukemic colonies as well as normal granulocyte colonies. Methods. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) after a standard course of intensive therapy in 108 patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia (67 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 30 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 9 in blast crisis from chronic myelogenous leukemia, and 2 with acute leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes). Treatment with granulocyte CSF (200 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area per day in a 30-minute infusion) was begun two days after the end of the chemotherapy and continued until the neutrophil count rose above 1500 per cubic millimeter. Results. Treatment with granulocyte CSF accelerated the recovery of neutrophils significantly (P less than 0.01), shortening it by about a week, but it had no effect on platelet recovery. Although the incidence of febrile episodes was almost the same, documented infections were significantly less frequent in the group treated with granulocyte CSF (P = 0.028). There was no evidence that granulocyte CSF accelerated the regrowth of leukemic cells. Fifty percent of 48 patients in the CSF group who could be evaluated and 36 percent of 50 controls had complete remission. The rate of relapse was almost the same in the two groups. Conclusions. It appears that recombinant human granulocyte CSF is safe in acute leukemia, accelerating neutrophil recovery and thereby reducing the incidence of documented infection without affecting the regrowth of leukemic cells. It should be used with caution, however, pending further confirmation of these early results.\r"

  ".W": "As a percentage of the gross national product, expenditures for health care in the United States are considerably larger than in Canada, even though one in seven Americans is uninsured whereas all Canadians have comprehensive health insurance. Among the sectors of health care, the difference in spending is especially large for physicians' services. In 1985, per capita expenditure was $347 in the United States and only $202 (in U.S. dollars) in Canada, a ratio of 1.72. We undertook a quantitative analysis of this ratio. We found that the higher expenditures per capita in the United States are explained entirely by higher fees; the quantity of physicians' services per capita is actually lower in the United States than in Canada. U.S. fees for procedures are more than three times as high as Canadian fees; the difference in fees for evaluation and management services is about 80 percent. Despite the large difference in fees, physicians' net incomes in the United States are only about one-third higher than in Canada. A parallel analysis of Iowa and Manitoba yielded results similar to those for the United States and Canada, except that physicians' net incomes in Iowa are about 60 percent higher than in Manitoba. Updating the analysis to 1987 on the basis of changes in each country between 1985 and 1987 yielded results similar to those obtained for 1985. We suggest that increased use of physicians' services in Canada may result from universal insurance coverage and from encouragement of use by the larger number of physicians who are paid lower fees per service. U.S. physicians' net income is not increased as much as the higher U.S. fees would predict, probably because of greater overhead expenses and the lower workloads of America's procedure-oriented physicians.\r"
