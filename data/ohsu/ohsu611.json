While undergoing investigation, he developed acute respiratory failure, thought to represent progression of his vasculitis. Open lung and sinus biopsies were performed to obtain the diagnosis. Vasculitis was confirmed on the paranasasl biopsy, and the lung biopsy showed pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila, an association not previously reported in Wegener's granulomatosis. If immunosuppressive therapy had been started without making the diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia on lung biopsy, the patient might well have succumbed to the infection.\r"

The relationship of the hyperinflation parameters to pulmonary function test results (PFTs) and arterial blood gas measurements (ABGs) in the emphysema patients was also examined. The radiographic measurements were diaphragmatic angle of depression, lung height, lung width, heart size, diaphragm level, radiographic total lung capacity (TLC), and size of the retrosternal air space. By discriminant function analysis, the best contributors to the function were lung height and diaphragmatic angle of depression, followed by radiographic TLC and heart size. The derived classification rule had a diagnostic accuracy of 88 percent. The radiographic measures, largely independent of one another, showed moderate correlations with percentage PFTs, ABGs, portable percentage spirometric studies, height, and weight. High correlations were found between several of the radiographic measurements and the PFTs that represent actual static lung volumes. The correlation between radiographically measured TLC and PFT TLC measured by the helium dilution technique was .90.\r"

  ".W": "Recent international trends in asthma mortality among people aged five to 34 years were examined as a follow-up to an epidemic of asthma deaths in the late 1970s which appeared to be confined to New Zealand. Mortality rates were compared in 14 countries with suitable statistics; Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Finland, France, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and West Germany, for the period 1970 to 1984/5. In New Zealand, asthma mortality in this age group more than trebled from 1.3 per 100,000 in 1974 to 4.2 per 100,000 in 1979 and since then has declined substantially to 1.85 per 100,000 in 1985. Asthma death rates vary more than six-fold among the other countries examined, and although the New Zealand experience has not been seen to the same degree elsewhere, a gradual increase in reported asthma mortality has occurred since the mid to late 1970s in the majority of countries studied. The increase and subsequent decline in asthma mortality in New Zealand could not be explained by changes in diagnostic fashions or in the International Classification of Disease coding rules. Similarly, the US data do not suggest there is diagnostic transfer among diseases of airway obstruction. However, part of the differences in asthma mortality among the countries examined and the recent increases in asthma death rates, could be due to changing diagnostic fashions rather than true differences in mortality. International studies on the validity of asthma death statistics and on asthma prevalence are required to clarify these issues.\r"

Electrocardiograms revealed no differences in mean sinus rate or ectopic dysrhythm between the two groups. Spatial 12- and 120-lead body surface electrocardiographic patterns were normal in 30 patients; two others had nonspecific T wave abnormalities. There were no differences in echo-determined left ventricular cavity size or systolic shortening fraction between the two groups. Three patients had segmental ventricular hypokinesis; 17 patients had small pericardial effusions. Data herein suggest effects on myocardial electrical and mechanical function in patients with viral illness. It may be prudent for such patients to minimize cardiac stress during illness.\r"

These 35 patients (group 1) were compared to a randomly selected group of 100 patients (group 2) aged 55 years or greater who underwent cardiac catheterization for evaluation of coronary artery disease during the same period. The two groups were compared in terms of angiographic features and risk factors for coronary artery disease. The patients in group 1 had a higher proportion of normal coronary arteries (14 percent [5 patients] vs 0; p less than 0.01) and single-vessel disease compared to group 2, while the incidence of three-vessel disease was much less (14 percent [5] vs 47 percent; p less than 0.001). Involvement of the left main coronary artery was uncommon in group 1 (3 percent [1] vs 15 percent in group 2; p less than 0.01). Risk factor analysis revealed smoking to be the most common risk factor in both groups (89 percent [31] in group 1 and 91 percent in group 2). Hypertension (28 percent [10] vs 48 percent; p less than 0.05) and diabetes (3 percent [1] vs 23 percent; p less than 0.01) were more common in group 2. Importantly, of 19 patients in group 1 who underwent cardiac catheterization for prognosis despite being asymptomatic and able to reach at least stage 4 on a Bruce protocol exercise test, none was found to have residual surgically correctable disease.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually have limited exercise tolerance owing to low ventilatory capacity. Because metabolic acidosis induced by exercise increases ventilatory drive, decreasing the hydrogen ion stimulus may improve exercise capacity. However, in those with mechanical limitation to ventilation or chemoreceptor insensitivity, identifying metabolic acidosis may be difficult using gas exchange methods that depend on the ventilatory response to the acidosis. We compared a modification of a gas exchange method (V-slope) for determining the lactate (anaerobic) threshold (AT), which is independent of ventilatory response with a method using the change in blood standard bicarbonate (HCO3-) level in COPD and normal subjects during cycle incremental exercise. In 43 normal subjects, the VO2 at which metabolic acidosis was identified using the two method correlated (r = 0.75), although mean values differed. In 22 patients with moderately severe to severe COPD, eight who had a change in standard HCO3- less than 2.0 mEq/L between rest and 2 min of recovery from exercise (group 1) were contrasted with 14 whose blood standard HCO3- fell by greater than 2.5 mEq/L (group 2). Mean VC was higher and FEV1/VC was lower in group 2, but mean FEV1, maximal voluntary ventilation, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide were not different. The degree of obstruction did not correlate strongly with the degree of exercise metabolic acidosis. The AT determined by the V-slope method was compared with that from standard HCO3-; good correlation between these methods was found (r = 0.98), although mean values were different. The V-slope method predicted metabolic acidosis in 10/14 who had a fall in HCO3- more than 2.5 mEq/L. A significant proportion of patients with COPD seem to develop metabolic acidosis during exercise. The V-slope gas exchange method may be useful in selecting those patients with COPD who develop exercise metabolic acidosis and might therefore benefit from exercise training.\r"

Of these 47, 35 (74.5 percent) underwent both radiation therapy (XRT) and YPR. The survival of these 35 patients (median survival, 304 days) was compared with that of 58 who underwent only palliative palliative XRT (median survival, 253 days) from 1981 to 1983, when YPR was not yet available at our institution. There was no significant difference in overall survival (p = 0.17). A significant increase in survival (p = 0.04) was seen in 15 patients who underwent emergency palliative YPR as the initial therapeutic intervention compared with 11 patients who received emergency palliative XRT but would have received YPR had it been available at that time. A trend toward increased survival was also shown in patients who underwent endobronchial radiation therapy in addition to YPR and XRT.\r"

Electrocardiograms (ECG) were done and serum verapamil and norverapamil concentrations measured before and for 12 h after each dose. For IV verapamil, there was a small decrease in area under the serum concentration-time curve and an increase in clearance after rifampin therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no changes in elimination half-life, volume of distribution, or AUC for percentage of change in P-R interval-time curve (AUCPR). For oral verapamil, there were marked decreases in peak concentration, AUC, oral bioavailability (all p less than 0.005), and AUCPR (p less than 0.001) after rifampin treatment. There were no changes in time to peak concentration or elimination half-life. For oral verapamil, significant P-R interval prolongation occurred only before treatment with rifampin. The decrease in oral bioavailability and the abolition of ECG response confirm that a highly significant drug interaction exists between rifampin and verapamil given orally but not intravenously.\r"

Venous blood was obtained at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes following instillation in order to determine concentrations of lidocaine and tetracycline. The mean peak serum concentration of lidocaine was 1.3 mu/ml +/- 0.4 microgram/ml (mean +/- SE) (range, 0.3 microgram/ml to 3.2 microgram/ml), and the mean time to peak serum concentration of lidocaine was 86 +/- 13 minutes. The mean peak serum concentration of tetracycline was 3.6 microgram/ml +/- 0.9 microgram/ml (range, 1.0 microgram/ml to 5.0 micrograms/ml), and the mean time to peak serum concentration of tetracycline was 96 +/- 16 minutes. Therapeutic serum concentrations of lidocaine were found in four of the seven patients and therapeutic serum levels of tetracycline in four of five patients. With systemic absorption of lidocaine and tetracycline following intrapleural instillation, patients are at risk for potential toxic effects. If lidocaine is used in a dosage of less than 3 mg/kg, toxic levels of the drug are unlikely to occur. Furthermore, use of tetracycline or lidocaine in pleurodesis is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity to the drugs.\r"

The method is based on simultaneous recording of two independent signals: high-pass filtered cough sounds and cough-induced fast movements of the body. The acoustic signals are recorded with a dynamic microphone in the acoustic focus of a glass fiber paraboloid mirror. Body movements are recorded with a static charge-sensitive bed located under an ordinary plastic foam mattress. The patient can be studied lying or sitting with no transducers or electrodes attached. A microcomputer is used for sampling of signals, detection of cough, statistical analyses, and on-line printing of results. The method was validated in seven adult patients with a total of 809 spontaneous cough events, using clinical observation as a reference. The sensitivity of the method to detect cough was 99.0 percent, and the positive predictivity was 98.1 percent. The system ignored speaking and snoring. The method provides a convenient means of reliable long-term follow-up of cough in clinical work and research.\r"

  ".U": "89030040\r", 
  ".W": "The popularity of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve (FVC) is in part due to the effort independence of expiratory flow. Of interest are expiratory flow rates at specific lung volumes, usually 50 and 25 percent of vital capacity (VC); Vmax50 and Vmax25, which make accurate assessment of lung volumes essential. Changes in lung volume during the test are due to both the volume of gas expired and the volume change due to gas compression (Vcomp). In normal subjects, Vcomp is small but may be considerable in those with airflow obstruction. When the FVC is measured in a plethysmograph (FVCp), both expired volume and Vcomp are measured. When the volume of the FVC is derived from gas expired at the mouth (FVCm), Vcomp is not considered and differences in Vmax25 or Vmax50 may occur. The magnitude of these errors was assessed in 30 children and young adults: nine normal subjects, ten with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 11 with asthma. For Vmax50, use of FVCm instead of FVCp resulted in an error of 8 +/- 7 percent (mean +/- 1 SD) in the normal subjects compared to 32 +/- 23 in those with CF (p less than 0.01) and 24 +/- 18 for those with asthma (p less than 0.05). For Vmax25, the errors were similar. These errors were not predictable from FEV1 or RV/TLC but were related to a combination of expiratory effort, the shape of the FVCp, and the absolute volume of gas that was being compressed (p less than 0.0001). These findings suggest that expiratory flows in the FVCm are not effort-independent in the face of significant airflow obstruction and that comparisons of values derived from an FVCp with those from an FVCm may not be valid.\r"

The age groups examined were above and below 42 years, the breakpoint for menopause in the women. Younger persons tended to be more obese and to have a higher AHI. Both sexes had similar pulmonary function, AHI, and nocturnal desaturation, but women experienced significantly fewer completely occluded breathing events and had apneas of shorter mean and maximum duration than men of similar ages. No effect of menopausal status per se was observed. In OSA patients, differences in upper airway occlusion and apnea duration suggest differences between the sexes in upper airway physiology or respiratory control.\r"

  ".W": "The best treatment of advanced rectal cancer remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome after palliative procedures in patients with advanced rectal cancer. One hundred and three patients treated over a seven-year period were identified, including 30 with local invasion, 18 with local metastases, and 55 with distant metastases. Patients were grouped into two groups: those who underwent palliative resection (68) and those who were treated without rectal resection (55). The nonresected group included patients who underwent diverting colostomies (28) and those who received multimodality therapy without surgery (7). The average age of all patients was 63.1 years. Patients in the nonresected group had more distant disease (68 percent) than the resected group (46 percent). Significant pelvic pain was a more common problem in the nonresected group (15 percent) than in the resected group (4 percent). Similarly, pelvic sepsis was more common in the nonresected group (14 percent) than in the resected group (9 percent). Postoperative mortality was 4.3 percent after palliative resection and 3.8 percent after diverting colostomy. Survival of the resected group at one year was 65 percent and at two years 20 percent. Survival of the nonresected group at one year was 20 percent and at two years 0 percent. Survival in the resected group was significantly (P less than .01) better than the nonresected group but probably can be attributed to the more extensive disease generally present in the patients who did not undergo resection. These results suggest that patients with advanced rectal cancers should undergo palliative resection whenever possible because resection decreases pelvic complications and may improve quality of life.\r"

  ".W": "Late diagnosis contributes significantly to the mortality and morbidity of mesenteric ischemia. Although flexible endoscopy permits noninvasive assessment of the colon, ischemic colitis is often difficult to differentiate from nonspecific proctitis/colitis or mucosal changes seen in inflammatory bowel diseases. Intravenously administered fluorescein sodium (FSC) has long been used intraoperatively to assess bowel viability because its uptake is inversely proportional to the degree of intestinal ischemia. The authors wished to determine if FSC could be used to augment conventional endoscopy in an attempt to identify and monitor ischemic areas of the bowel within reach of the endoscope. Segmental mesenteric ligation of canine rectum was performed, and serial transanal biopsies obtained. Endoscopy was performed after intravenous FSC administration, using a rigid proctoscope, with a long-wave ultraviolet light source inserted into the lumen of the scope. Areas of nonspecific-appearing proctitis did not take up FSC and were easily differentiated from well-perfused areas by their failure to fluoresce. Ischemic areas were monitored in this manner over a 28-day period. Complete resolution of ischemic mucosal changes occurred with late stricture formation. In humans, the sigmoid and left colon are the areas most frequently affected by ischemic colitis. Because long-wave ultraviolet light is not transmitted through glass fibers, a different light source was needed for potential clinical application. To this end, a single fiber of an argon laser was inserted through the instrument channel of a colonoscope, resulting in greater fluorescence than seen with the ultraviolet light. FSC endoscopy appears to be a sensitive and accurate method of detecting and monitoring ischemic colitis and has many potential clinical applications.\r"

Leukergy was found to parallel the clinical and endoscopic findings of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, leukergy was found to be more accurate than white blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is also found to accurately assess the course of the disease when clinical and other laboratory tests were masked by steroid and antibiotic administrations. Leukergy is a quick, inexpensive test that can easily be performed at the patient's bedside.\r"

Total bacterial counts showed overgrowth of fecal bacteria in each group, but the anaerobic bacterial counts were significantly higher (P less than .05) in the two pouch groups than in the conventional ileostomy group. Mucosal morphology did not differ among the three groups showing either normal mucosa or mild chronic inflammatory changes in most patients. In contrast, five of the six patients with clinical pouchitis had acute inflammatory changes in histologic specimens. Fecal bacteriologic findings in these patients did not differ quantitatively or qualitatively from others. It is concluded that proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis predisposes to ileal bacterial overgrowth, and after pouch operations especially, anaerobic overgrowth may be one factor in the development of pouch inflammation. Acute clinical pouchitis with clear histologic changes was, however, not connected with specific changes in fecal bacteriology.\r"

  ".U": "89030121\r", 
  ".W": "An experimental, randomized, prospective study was performed in 64 dogs to evaluate the effect of fecal loading, solely, or in combination with induced peritonitis, on colonic anastomosis. The animals, none of which had bowel preparations, were randomized into four groups. Group I underwent sigmoid resection and standard open end-to-end anastomosis; Group II underwent sigmoid resection and an intracolonic bypass procedure; Group III underwent experimentally induced fecal peritonitis, sigmoid resection, and anastomosis; Group IV underwent induction of fecal peritonitis, sigmoid resection and an intracolonic bypass procedure. Using Fisher's exact test, results indicate a more statistically significant increased leak rate in Group III than in Group II (P = .04), and Group III than in Group IV (P = .03), but no statistically significant anastomotic leak rate between the peritonitis (III and IV) and the nonperitonitis (I and II) groups. A very significant statistical increase in leak rate (P = .002) was observed when comparing the 25 percent leak rate of Groups I and III (anastomosis subjected to fecal contact) with the 0 percent leak rate of Groups II and IV (anastomosis excluded from fecal contact) regardless of the peritonitis. This study suggests that the intraluminal contact of fecal loading at the colonic anastomosis is a more significant factor in anastomotic complications due to dehiscences than peritonitis per se. It follows, therefore, that if feces can be excluded from intraluminal contact with an anastomotic site, an anastomosis can be safely performed even in the presence of treated peritonitis.\r"

As a replacement for the resected ureter, ileal substitution was applied in all eight patients--unilateral in six patients and bilateral in two. Serum creatinine and electrolyte patterns were within the normal range in all patients. A voiding cystogram showed no reflux to the anastomosed ureter, and a mild reflux to the ileal segment. The patients had excellent prognoses with regard to local control and also satisfactory functional results with the ileal ureter.

In normal mucosa DBA bound selectively to mucin of the goblet cells in the upper colonic crypt and to apical cytoplasm of the superficial columnar cells with a strong linear pattern. PNA binding was present only in the supranuclear portion (Golgi area) of the cells. WGA showed a strong reactivity in the goblet-cell mucin and in the supranuclear portion and apical cytoplasm of columnar cells. Transitional mucosa (TM) showed a decrease in DBA binding to goblet-cell mucin, which was replaced by an increase in PNA reactivity. The DBA linear pattern in the apical cytoplasm of columnar cells was unmodified, however. Changes similar to those of TM were observed in juvenile and Peutz-Jeghers polyps. Adenomas showed a progressive loss of DBA reactivity and an increase in PNA positivity related to the degree of dysplasia. This change was more evident in the linear pattern of apical cytoplasm. Only 32% of the carcinomas reacted with DBA and those were mucinous and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. WGA was positive in all carcinomas with a different pattern than in normal mucosa. These findings suggest that the different lectin-binding patterns in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa are related to the degree of cellular differentiation. In the process of malignant transformation the carbohydrate distribution undergoes progressive changes through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. These changes are related to the degree of dysplasia in adenomas and to the degree of differentiation in carcinomas.\r"

The syndrome is reviewed with reference to genetics, colonic and central nervous system manifestations. This evidence suggests that Turcot's syndrome represents one manifestation of the pleiotropic autosomal dominant gene responsible for familial polyposis coli and the associated extracolonic manifestations of Gardner's syndrome. A diagnosis of Turcot's syndrome should be restricted to those patients with familial polyposis coli associated with gliomas or medulloblastomas. A further case is presented that is believed to be the first report of such a case in the United Kingdom.\r"

  ".W": "Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is sufficiently uncommon that the clinician or general pathologist may lack familiarity with the disorder and may confuse it with other inflammatory bowel diseases. To evaluate the role of collagen staining in facilitating the differential diagnosis of SRUS, an initial open review was undertaken on 1672 consecutive patients whose 4780 colorectal biopsies were stained with H&E with added saffron to demonstrate collagen. Excess mucosal collagen was present in 39 (2.3%) of these patients. Twenty patients with a diffuse excess of mucosal collagen in biopsies from rectal ulcer margins or from otherwise abnormal rectal mucosa had SRUS; in the remaining 19 patients, excess mucosal collagen was focal (seven ischemic colitis, five collagenous colitis, three adenocarcinoma, and four chronic idiopathic ulcerative colitis). Diffuse excess mucosal collagen never was seen in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (128 Crohn's colitis and 446 ulcerative colitis). Blinded reviews then were performed on rectal biopsies from 33 patients with a variety of diagnoses (14 SRUS and 19 controls). Diffuse excess collagen by saffron staining was consistently observed in SRUS but was absent in all 19 controls. Additional blinded reviews were carried out because the collagen staining pattern in ischemic colitis, although focal, could potentially be confused with SRUS. It was possible to differentiate these two diseases blindly from one another by using additional histologic criteria (14 SRUS and 12 ischemic colitis). We conclude that the demonstration of a diffuse excess of mucosal collagen in rectal biopsies facilitates the diagnosis of SRUS and differentiates it from idiopathic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with which SRUS is often confused, and other inflammatory bowl diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean lactic acid concentration was significantly elevated in ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, but values correlated with fecal weight only in the former syndrome. In ulcerative colitis, concentrations of each short-chain fatty acid, especially butyrate, were decreased compared with those from normals or Crohn's disease. Lactate and short-chain fatty acids accounted for nearly half the variability in fecal weight in ulcerative colitis. Crohn's patients had elevated mean fecal water osmolality and osmotic gap not observed in ulcerative colitis. Increased lactic acid and/or deficient short-chain fatty acids may modulate the diarrhea of ulcerative colitis. This mechanism seems less important in Crohn's colitis where an additional osmotic component may be significant.\r"

In order to investigate this further, the lectin-binding properties of rectal glycoconjugates have been studied in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and controls using lectin-peroxidase histochemistry. Ten lectins were used including peanut agglutinin (PNA) which is known to bind to malignant and adenomatous but not normal colonic mucins. Eight of 21 ulcerative colitis rectal biopsies and 10 of 17 Crohn's disease rectal biopsies showed PNA positivity, particularly in the supranuclear region of surface epithelial cells. There was no correlation between PNA positivity and duration of disease or inflammation, and none of the biopsies showed evidence of dysplasia. This abnormality in epithelial cell glycoconjugates seems to be commonly present in nondysplastic mucosa and occurs in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It may reflect a fundamental abnormality in mucus glycoprotein synthesis in inflammatory bowel disease.\r"

To see if this hyperplastic effect on the rat small intestine was due to the mitogenic properties of the isolated lectin, male weanling rats were fed a chow containing 0.1% of the isolated lectin for six days. Age-matched control rats were fed regular chow. Both control and lectin-fed rats were sacrificed at one, two, three, four, and six days after the start of lectin feeding. The proximal small intestinal mucosa of rats fed lectin showed gradual increases in protein and DNA contents throughout the experimental period. Morphological studies showed marked increases in crypt depth from days 1 through 6 in these rats with essentially no change in mucosal thickness or villous height. DNA synthetic activity peaked at day 2, but was higher than control throughout the experimental period. Labeling index was 0.36 +/- 0.03 in duodenum of controls as compared to 0.45 +/- 0.02 in duodenum of weanling rats fed lectin for two days. These results demonstrate that RKB lectin stimulates overall DNA synthetic activity and increases crypt cell proliferation on the small intestine of weanling rats. The observed mucosal hyperplasia is probably due to increases in crypt cell population as shown by the increase in crypt depth.\r"

Electrodes were implanted in rats throughout the intestine. Compared to control animals, the duration of postprandial interruption of the myoelectric complex (DIMC) was rapidly increased after jejunal resection, more gradually augmented after jejunal bypass, and remained constant after ileal resection. The frequency of occurrence of spike bursts during the postprandial period was significantly decreased in the short remaining proximal segment after jejunal resection and was not changed in the ileum. The jejunal bypass induced no change in the frequency throughout the remaining bowel. Ileal resection was followed by a decrease on the jejunum. The percentage of slow waves superimposed by a spike burst remained constant after jejunal resection and bypass but was significantly decreased after ileal resection on the whole remaining intestine. These results show important modifications in postprandial motor activity of the small bowel, which appear rapidly after jejunal resection, more gradually after jejunal bypass, and which are less pronounced after ileal resection. This electromyographic study emphasizes the role of intestinal motility in the development of adaptation after small bowel resection or bypass.\r"

Intrinsic factor-mediated uptake of cobalamin could not be demonstrated using ileal crypt or jejunal villous or crypt cells. When incubated with [3H] taurocholate, the uptake by ileal villous cells was significantly greater than by ileal crypt or jejunal villous cells. These results indicate the suitability of using isolated guinea pig villous and crypt cells to examine transport processes of molecules that involve specialized mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that the undifferentiated crypt cell lacks specific transport processes necessary for the active absorption of cobalamin and taurocholate.\r"

The colon was more commonly inflamed than the small intestine in acute gastroenteritis. Fecal indium-111 radioactivity excretion was elevated in gastroenteritis and in chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The magnitude of the intestinal inflammatory response, as measured by fecal indium-111 excretion, is equivalent in acute gastroenteritis caused by a defined enteropathogen and exacerbations of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. All patients with microscopically detected fecal leukocytosis gave positive intestinal scintiscans, whereas negative scans were obtained on patients without fecal leukocytosis. The results of this study suggest that indium-111-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes can be used to study pathophysiology of the enteric inflammatory response in acute infectious gastroenteritis.\r"

Sucrase specific activity was correlated with the carbohydrate content of the diet but not affected by age throughout the adult life-span. In a second experiment, the acute induction of sucrase following a 48-hr fast was studied in 58- and 116-week-old rats. The increase in sucrase specific activity following refeeding was not different in the adult and aged rats.

HE was performed by bleeding from the carotid artery to reduce arterial blood pressure to about 50 mm Hg (3 ml bleeding per 200 g of body weight) with a significant decrease in arterial pH and [HCO3-], and indomethacin was given subcutaneously in a dose of 5 mg/kg. The proximal duodenum (1.7 cm) secreted HCO3- at the rate of 1.5-1.8 mueq/15 min (3.5-4.2 mueq/cm/hr), and responded to luminal acid (10 mM HCl for 10 min) by a significant rise in HCO3- output. Indomethacin had no effect on basal HCO3- output but significantly inhibited the acid-induced HCO3- secretion, while under HE conditions duodenal HCO3- output significantly declined and failed to increase in response to luminal acidification. Subcutaneously administered 16,16-dmPGE2 (30 micrograms/kg) significantly increased HCO3- secretion in the presence of indomethacin but had less effect on the impaired HCO3- output caused by HE. In contrast, intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 (3 mmol/kg/hr) ameliorated the acid-base imbalance caused by HE, and significantly restored the impaired HCO3- responses induced by HE but not by indomethacin. Both HE and indomethacin induced extensive damage in the mucosa when the duodenal loop was perfused with 50 mM HCl for 1.5 hr, and these lesions were significantly reduced by NaHCO3 infusion and 16,16-dmPGE2, respectively. These results suggest that HE impaired duodenal HCO3- secretion and reduced the tolerance of the mucosa to acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The vascular response of some nonsplanchnic organs was also examined. Blood flow of the arteries was measured by electromagnetic flowmetry and that of the tissues by 15-micron microspheres. Isoproterenol increased (P less than 0.05) blood flow of the axillary artery (+52%), and the superior mesenteric artery (+45%), but not that of the inferior mesenteric artery. In the nongastrointestinal tissues, isoproterenol increased (P less than 0.05) the blood flow of the left (+46%), and right ventricle (+85%), and the skeletal muscle (+100%). In the gastrointestinal tract, isoproterenol increased (P less than 0.05) blood flow in the esophagogastric junction (+505%) and antrum (+1511%) only, but not in the gastric body or in any location of the small or large intestine. The drug also caused a large fall in resistance in the esophagogastric junction (-74%) and antrum (-94%), and a small, but significant fall in the duodenum, jejunum, and in the mid-small intestine. It had no significant effect on vascular resistance in the gastric body, ileum, or colon. In those locations of the gastrointestinal tract where isoproterenol caused an increase in blood flow, this effect was confined to the combined mucosal plus submucosal layer, and the drug had no effect on the muscularis. These data suggest that different locations of the gastrointestinal tract respond differently to the same circulating concentration of isoproterenol. The mechanism of this difference in response merits further investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to determine the effect of a newly synthesized benzimidazole derivative NC-1300-B on H+, K+-ATPase (proton pump) in the hog gastric mucosa and on the basal gastric acid secretion and necrotizing agent-induced gastric lesions in rats. NC-1300-B inhibited the proton pump in a concentration-dependent manner and concentrations which inhibited the enzyme activity by 50% were 4.4 x 10(-6) M at pH 6.0 and 3.1 x 10(-5) M at pH 7.4. NC-1300-B administered orally or intraperitoneally 0.5 hr before ligating the pylorus inhibited the gastric acid secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The ED50 values (doses which inhibit acid output or lesion formation by 50%) for acid secretion were 11.5 and 11.0 mg/kg with oral and intraperitoneal administration, respectively. The antisecretory effect in a dose of 100 mg/kg persisted for up to 72 hr. NC-1300-B administered orally or intraperitoneally 0.5 hr before HCl.ethanol administration protected against damage of the gastric mucosa in a dose-dependent manner. The ED50 values for lesion formation were 13.3 and 23.0 mg/kg with oral and intraperitoneal administration, respectively. This protection with an oral dose of 100 mg/kg persisted for up to 72 hr. While pretreatment with 5 mg/kg of indomethacin given subcutaneously did not appreciably reverse the NC-1300-B protection, the pretreatment with 10 mg/kg of N-ethylmaleimide given subcutaneously potently reversed the NC-1300-B protection. NC-1300-B administered intragastrically at 30 mg/kg significantly inhibited the amplitude of gastric contraction for 50 min after intragastric administration. These effects of NC-1300-B on gastric secretion and lesion formation are much the same as those of the established proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, except for the short duration of the action of omeprazole (less than 24 hr).\r"

  ".W": "The advantages of gastric diversion over pylorus ligation in rat gastric mucosal integrity and acid secretion studies over 6 hr were investigated. Mucosal injury developed in 80% of pylorus-ligation controls. Atropine (5 mg/kg) or cimetidine (40 mg/kg) had no effect on this injury (2.9 mm2 +/- 0.9 and 2.8 mm2 +/- 0.7, respectively, vs 3.1 mm2 +/- 1, mean +/- SEM, N = 10); however vagotomy increased it (13.7 mm2 +/- 1.5, mean +/- SEM, N = 10, P less than 0.001). Gastric diversion produced no mucosal injury. Pylorus-ligation H+ output was higher than that of gastric diversion (390.5 mumol +/- 54.8 vs 61 mumol +/- 2.5, mean +/- SEM, N = 10, P less than 0.001). Cimetidine (40 mg/kg) depressed H+ output of gastric diversion (21.3 mumol +/- 1.2 vs 61 mumol +/- 2.5, mean +/- SEM, N = 10, P less than 0.001), but not of pylorus ligation (424 mumol +/- 74.2 vs 390.5 mumol +/- 54.8, mean +/- SEM, N = 10). Vagotomy or atropine depressed pylorus-ligation H+ output (P less than 0.001), but each allowed an output (36.6 mumol +/- 5.5 and 120 mumol +/- 29, respectively, mean +/- SEM, N = 10) significantly (P less than 0.001) higher than that associated with it in gastric diversion (16 mumol +/- 1.4 and 17.1 mumol +/- 1.6, respectively, mean +/- SEM, N = 10). This study demonstrates that in the rat pylorus ligation, in contrast to gastric diversion, injures the gastric mucosa, stimulates H+ secretion, and overshadows the efficacy of antisecretory agents.\r"

  ".W": "The etiology of the deep bandlike necrotic gastric mucosal lesions induced by the oral administration of corrosive agents in the rat is unclear. An understanding of why the lesions are so precisely localized and how they develop should increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which the prostaglandins prevent them. This study utilizes an innocuous dye to demonstrate that the initial mucosal contact by orally administered agents is restricted to the crests of mucosal folds. A sequential study of lesion development at the fold crest indicates that coagulative necrosis occurs on contact and that the vascular defects, hemorrhage and congestion, are secondary to deep corrosion injury. Exogenous prostaglandin and 0.35 N HCl were found to abolish mucosal folding and hence prevent the fold-related lesions. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis was found to sensitize the mucosal fold crest to injury by 0.35 N HCl, and hence the use of indomethacin as a proof that endogenous prostaglandin synthesis plays a role in preventing bandlike lesions by such agents is questioned. It is concluded that the gastric mucosal fold plays a major role in localizing mucosal injury to parallel bands and that the obliteration of these sensitive sites may explain the protective effect of an ever-expanding number of agents. As lesions genesis appears to be the result of a contact artifact, the use of this model in the study of the physiological role played by gastric prostaglandins is seriously questioned.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After having verified that the ulcer had healed, gastric acid secretory responses to graded doses of tetragastrin from 62.5 to 16,000 ng/kg/hr were investigated using a logarithmic transformation model. Several clinical features were also investigated. The patients were divided into three groups based on the later endoscopic follow-up study for two years. The early-recurrent group included 16 patients with recurrence occurring within three months. The late-recurrent group included 25 with recurrence occurring after three months. The nonrecurrent group included 24 patients without recurrences during the follow-up period. The 20 healthy male subjects were defined as a control group. The results were as follows: (1) Significant differences were not discerned either in basal and peak acid outputs between the three patients groups. (2) The ED50 value for tetragastrin was lower in the early-recurrent group than in the other three groups. (3) The early-recurrent group showed a higher percentage of smokers than the other patient groups. These results suggest that smoking and increased parietal cell responsiveness correlates strongly with duodenal ulcer recurrence.\r"

Sixty-four patients had endometriosis and adhesions vaporized with a CO2 laser (LAS) and were prospectively compared with a control group (CON) of 44 patients who had laparoscopy. The 6- and 12-month estimated cumulative pregnancy rates for LAS were 0.32 +/- 0.07 and 0.55 +/- 0.09 respectively, and for CON 0.17 +/- 0.06 and 0.43 +/- 0.09 (Breslow P = 0.10). Monthly fecundity rates were 6.7% in LAS and 4.5% in CON. Survival analysis with fixed covariates showed that pregnancy rates were increased in patients with adhesions (P = 0.002) and other pelvic disease (P = 0.0001). Pregnancy rates were reduced by age (P = 0.02), previous adhesiolysis (P = 0.0000) and post-laparoscopy medical treatment (P = 0.0002).

There was no correlation between the severity of the endometriosis and the frequency of spontaneous abortions. After treatment, the frequency of spontaneous abortions was significantly decreased in both the endometriosis and the tubal disease group, but these values were not significantly different from each other. We conclude that high spontaneous abortion rates are a characteristic of other subgroups of women with secondary infertility and not just in women with endometriosis, and that the majority of spontaneous abortions associated with endometriosis are not caused by the condition.\r"

Nulligravid women who were 120% or more over their ideal weight were also at increased risk for ovulatory infertility (relative risk = 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 4.3). Neither association was seen among women who had been previously pregnant. The presence of abnormalities of endocrinologic reproductive function in underweight and overweight women argues that the associations we have noted in nulligravid women represent cause-and-effect relationships. If so, we estimate that 6% of primary infertility in which ovulatory dysfunction is present results from being excessively underweight, and another 6% from being excessively overweight.\r"

Quantitative histologic techniques were employed, and the results were compared with normal ranges derived from a separate, normal, fertile population. It was found that RU486 inhibited glandular secretory activity, accelerated degenerative changes, induced various vascular changes, increased stromal but not glandular mitotic activity, and did not affect the predecidual reaction. The superiority of morphometric analysis over traditional dating criteria was demonstrated in this study of endometrial responses to an exogenously administered agent. In addition, it was found that temperature drop occurred in 56%, menstrual induction in 43%, luteolysis in 24%, mood change in 23%, and thirst sensation in 3% of women studied. Both menstrual induction and changes in hypothalamic function after the administration of RU486 occurred independently of luteolysis and so were likely to be the direct result of progesterone receptor blockade in these organs. Menstrual induction was significantly related to the dose given and the day on which RU486 was administered. Mood change was significantly related to the day on which RU486 was given. Most of the effects of RU486 occurred around 48 hours after its administration.\r"

Also, the conventional liver function tests were performed. Ultrasonography was used to detect any possible changes in the gallbladder function. The fasting concentrations of CA increased (P less than 0.05) during therapy, while those of CDCA did not change. The ratio of CA/CDCA also increased (P less than 0.001). The maximal response of CA after the test meal increased (P less than 0.01) during the trial. As regards the other liver function tests, only the transaminases significantly increased (P less than 0.01) after 1 month of therapy but showed a tendency to decrease later during the trial. The gallbladder's volume and function did not change. All the parameters studied normalized within 1 month of cessation of danazol therapy. Danazol seems to have a rather mild effect on liver function. The analyzed parameters indicate transient cell wall injury and slight disturbances in liver cell uptake and secretion mechanism and also of synthesis activity.\r"

Current cigarette smoking and obesity were associated with increased maturation. In contrast, years past menopause, parity, and coffee and tea consumption were all unrelated to vaginal epithelial maturation.

In secretary endometrium, 10(-6)M CC about doubled the basal output of PGF2 alpha and PGE2; 10(-8)M E2 increased the production of these PGs 3-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively. The effects of E2 at this concentration were not diminished by the addition of CC, even at 100-fold molar excess, under conditions in which 10(-7)M progesterone or 10(-6)M 4-hydroxytamoxifen suppressed completely the action of the natural estrogen. In proliferative endometrium, 10(-8)M and 10(-6)M CC had no consistent effect on E2 17 beta-dehydrogenase activity or glycogen accumulation. These results demonstrate that, under in vitro conditions, CC can exert direct estrogenic effects on the endometrium but does not act as an antiestrogen or a progestagen.\r"

Before treatment, each man delivered another three semen samples with the same time intervals as during the study period. PGE2 was also administered to seven men during naproxen treatment and ejaculates were sampled as above. PGE2 did not influence the 90 minutes' posttreatment ejaculates, but after 24 hours there was a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in sperm counts as compared to the control samples. The change in sperm count was suggested to be due to an effect of PG on the contractile elements in the deferent duct. Sperm motility, viability, and morphology as well as semen volume and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content remained unchanged. The total semen PGE content was increased 24 hours after treatment from 169 micrograms/ejaculate to 213 micrograms/ejaculate (P = 0.02). In the combined PGE2/naproxen treatment the PGE levels were significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated in the ejaculate 48 hours after treatment. The increase may indicate an increased de novo synthesis of prostaglandins. Based on the results from the analysis of the composition of the 19-hydroxy PGF-isomers with and without naproxen treatment, it is speculated that oral PGE2 influences the cyclo-oxygenase activity.\r"

  ".W": "Activities of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma were measured in extracts of testicular biopsy specimen obtained from 37 cases of male infertility with left varicocele and compared with those of 6 normal controls. It was observed that levels of DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma were significantly lower in infertile men than normal controls on both sides of testes. Among three DNA polymerases, the level of DNA polymerase beta activity well correlated with the histological findings (Johnsen's score), i.e., the extent of differentiation of germinal cells. DNA polymerase beta activity appeared to be the lowest in the patients whose sperm density was less than 5 X 10(6)/ml. On the other hand, no correlation was apparent between levels of DNA polymerases and other clinical parameters, e.g., testicular volume, sperm motility, grade of varicocele, and serum hormone levels. These results suggest that the combined decrease in the DNA polymerase activities may be one of the factors that have deleterious effects on spermatogenesis in varicocele patients.\r"

The present study was planned in order to evaluate the efficiency of a new regimen of treatment by 25 mg on alternate days (group A), compared to a daily dose of 25 mg (25 days on, 5 days off, group B), for 4 months. Semen quality was assessed in two matched groups, which consisted of 45 and 44 normogonadotropic oligoterato-asthenozoospermic (OTA) men, respectively. Nine men in group A and 22 in group B did not respond to therapy by improvement in semen quality. The statistical evaluation of the results revealed group A to yield the highest improvement in sperm concentration (P less than 0.0008) and total sperm count (P less than 0.004). Sperm motility was improved only in group A. No changes were recorded in the morphology of the sperm cells or in semen volume. Pregnancy rate after 6 months of follow-up was 26.7% and 20.5%, in couples of groups A and B, respectively. This study implicates the use of CC (25 mg on alternate days) in andrologic clinics as one of the recommended drugs for normogonadotropic OTA subfertile men in order to achieve a significant increase in sperm concentration and total sperm count.\r"

The age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate was 32.7/1000 person-yr (95% Cl = 27.6, 37.8) in diabetic subjects without proteinuria, similar to the rate of 30.1/1000 person-yr (95% Cl = 25.7, 34.4) in nondiabetic subjects without proteinuria. By contrast, in diabetic subjects with proteinuria the mortality rate was 121.4/1000 person-yr (95% Cl = 97.5, 145.3). When controlled for age, sex, and diabetes duration, diabetic subjects with proteinuria had a death rate 3.5 times as high (95% Cl = 2.8, 4.4) as those without proteinuria. Of the excess mortality associated with NIDDM in Pima Indians, 97% was found in subjects with proteinuria. The death rate in diabetic subjects without proteinuria was not appreciably greater than the rate in nondiabetic subjects. Mortality rates from uremia and cardiovascular disease were significantly higher in diabetic Pima Indians with proteinuria than in those without. These relationships are similar to observations reported in people with insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

Rats fed a 50% galactose diet developed mature cataracts in 23 days, whereas rats fed a 50% galactose diet with 0.4% butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) had clear lenses. On day 10, both groups had comparable galactitol levels in the lens, but hydration in the former group, as determined by the lens weight, was approximately 10% more than in the latter. On day 23, galactitol levels in the latter group were 92% higher (approximately 85 mM) than in the former group, but lens weight was lower. These results indicate that sugar-induced cataractogenesis in rats is not solely due to polyol accumulation. Oxidative damage is probably a major cause of the advancement of cataractogenesis.\r"

Because the diabetic state in rats is associated with lowered T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 levels and because diabetic patients excrete large amounts of myo-inositol, a lipotropic agent, we investigated the effects of myo-inositol and T3 on the elevated myocardial lipid levels and depressed cardiac performance of streptozocin (55 mg/kg i.v.)-induced diabetic (STZ-D) rats. myo-inositol (2.5 g.kg-1.day-1 in the drinking water) and T3 (30 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 s.c.) were given for an 8-wk period 3 days after diabetes induction. Untreated diabetic rats were characterized by a decreased rate of body weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hypoinsulinemia, which were not altered after myo-inositol and/or T3 treatment. Thyroid status of diabetic animals was normalized by T3 alone or in combination with myo-inositol but not by myo-inositol alone. The elevations in plasma and myocardial lipids associated with the diabetic state were prevented by myo-inositol treatment. However, the plasma lipid and myocardial cholesterol levels in diabetic rats remained elevated or were further increased with treatment with T3 or myo-inositol plus T3. myo-inositol treatment partially improved cardiac performance in STZ-D rats. T3 treatment alone did not prevent cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats. There was, however, some improvement in heart function in the groups treated with both myo-inositol and T3, coinciding with a significant decrease in the myocardial triacylglycerol level. The data indicate that a possible correlation may exist between elevated myocardial triacylglycerol levels and cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose concentration gradients across the liver and hepatic blood flow were measured to characterize the relationship of hepatic glucose uptake to hepatic glucose concentration for 240 min after administration of a large oral glucose load to fasted rats. Extraction of glucose occurred only transiently, from 20 to 80 min after glucose administration. The liver changed from net glucose output to net glucose removal only when the intracellular hepatic glucose concentration exceeded 12.5 mumol/ml water. Even when arteriovenous glucose concentrations gradients were compatible with net direct hepatic uptake of glucose, the hepatic glucose concentration always exceeded the inflow glucose concentration. These data indicate that direct glucose uptake occurred against a concentration gradient when the liver is considered as a whole. The hepatic intracellular-to-extracellular glucose concentration gradient changed very little, suggesting that this is not being regulated by glucose, insulin, or other effectors. The mechanism by which the hepatic glucose concentration and net hepatic glucose uptake versus output are coordinated is unknown. The rate of glycogen synthesis was linear for 120 min after administration of the glucose load. This occurred in the presence of direct uptake of glucose early in the time course and later in the presence of net glucose output by the liver. Net direct uptake of glucose by the liver could account for, at most, 37-55% of the glycogen formed. Fractional extraction of both lactate and alanine decreased after glucose was given, but net hepatic uptake of these metabolites could account for 33-49 and 7-10%, respectively, of the glycogen formed, depending on plasma versus blood water flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because fish oil supplementation may favorably affect lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in nondiabetic subjects, we determined the effect of fish oil concentrate on plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition in patients with NIDDM. Dietary-supplementation 1-mo periods of 4.0 and 7.5 g of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil were compared with a placebo of 12 g safflower oil by use of a single-blind crossover design. Medications, including antidiabetic therapy, were continued through the study. Compared with safflower oil treatment, fish oil supplementation resulted in a significant reduction of total plasma triglycerides of 24% at the 4-g dose and a larger reduction of 39% at the 7.5-g dose. These decreases were due to similar reductions in VLDL triglycerides. LDL cholesterol levels were mildly elevated, but a larger 20% increase in LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentration was observed. During supplementation with the fish oil concentrate, the LDL cholesterol-to-apoB ratio was significantly reduced when compared with pretreatment values, but not when compared with safflower oil treatment. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and plasma apoA1 levels were not significantly changed during fish oil treatment. At the 7.5-g dose, fasting glucose and glycohemoglobin levels increased by 20 and 12%, respectively, but were unchanged at the lower level of supplementation. Thus, in NIDDM patients, dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids induces a reduction in total plasma and VLDL triglyceride levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Lithium chloride reduce the measured parameters of gastric secretion (gastric volume, hydrogen ion concentration, and gastric acid output) 2 h after intracerebroventricular, intravenous, or subcutaneous administration in pylorus-ligated rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Intracerebroventricular administration of lithium was approximately five times and 10 times more potent than intravenous and subcutaneous injection, respectively. Time-course study demonstrated that the action of lithium (400 micrograms) on gastric secretion reached a peak at 1 h after intracerebroventricular administration; however, the effects on volume and output were still significant after 8 h. Prior intracerebroventricular injection of indomethacin (400 micrograms) reversed the action of centrally administered lithium on gastric secretion. However, central administration of the opiate receptor blocker naltrexone (100 micrograms), as well as subcutaneous administration of indomethacin (5 mg/kg), failed to modify the effect of lithium on gastric acid secretion. Our data suggest that lithium appears to act centrally to modulate gastric acid secretion in rats through a mechanism involving the synthesis of prostaglandinlike material(s) in the brain. Furthermore, the effect of centrally administered lithium is independent of stimulation of opiate receptor(s) in the brain.\r"

For localization of activity, pinch biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa from 6 subjects were taken from the greater and lesser curvatures within 2 cm of the gastroesophageal junction (upper greater curvature and upper lesser curvature) and within 2 cm of the pylorus (lower greater curvature and lower lesser curvature). Lipase activity was higher in the upper greater curvature (405 +/- 92 mU) than in the upper lesser curvature (32 +/- 13 mU) and lowest in the antral area (16 +/- 9 mU in the lower lesser curvature and 10 +/- 2 mU in the lower greater curvature). The data show that in the human, lipase activity is localized primarily in the fundic area of the stomach. Comparison of the lipase activity levels in the gastric mucosa with lingual lipase activity levels in specimens of lingual serous glands indicates that in humans, gastric lipase is the main lipase active in the stomach.\r"

Although plasma gastrin levels were the same during treatment, the enterochromaffinlike (ECL) cell density increased approximately linearly with time at a rate correlated to the plasma gastrin level. Antrectomy prevented the ECL cell hyperplasia seen in omeprazole-treated rats, suggesting that it was not caused by omeprazole per se. Changes in ECL cell density roughly paralleled changes in oxyntic mucosal histidine carboxylase activity and histamine concentration. Treatment with omeprazole also raised stomach weight and antral gastrin and gastrin cell density, reduced antral somatostatin cell density, but did not affect enterochromaffin cell density. Within 19 days of cessation of a 10-wk treatment course, plasma gastrin levels, oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity, and antral gastrin and somatostatin cell densities had returned to control levels. The stomach weight was normal within 5-10 wk, antral gastrin concentration within 10 wk, and oxyntic mucosal ECL cell density and histamine concentration within 20 wk. After renewed treatment with omeprazole for 10 wk starting 10 wk after completion of the first omeprazole treatment period, changes in all parameters were of similar magnitude in animals previously treated with omeprazole and those previously treated with vehicle. The results suggest that the effects described are reversible and that gastrin cells turn over more rapidly than ECL cells.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrolyzed carrageenan is used to induce ileocecal inflammation in laboratory animals. We used ileal epithelial cell monolayer cultures (IEC18) to study the cellular and paracellular injurious effects of hydrolyzed carrageenan via an examination of its effects on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, chromium release, and cell morphology. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that carrageenan-treated cells initially contracted and pulled away from neighboring cells. Cell and viability counts illustrated that hydrolyzed carrageenan retarded cell growth and eventually caused cell death. [3H]Thymidine incorporation revealed that hydrolyzed carrageenan at a concentration of 0.25 g/L inhibited deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis by 20% during a 5-h labeling period in 1-wk-old confluent monolayers. Chromium 51 release assay demonstrated that a 22-h exposure to 0.75 g/L of hydrolyzed carrageenan induced the release of 30% of the 51Cr trapped in 1-wk-old confluent monolayers. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the disruption of cellular junctions occurred before cell membrane injury. When we treated the monolayers with drugs commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including prednisolone, 5-aminosalicylic acid, metronidazole, and 6-mercaptopurine, we were not able to demonstrate a reduction in carrageenan-induced cell injury; however, catalase at 1 mg/ml decreased carrageenan cytotoxicity. These studies demonstrate that hydrolyzed carrageenan produces intestinal epithelial injury in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Morphologic injury starts at the site of cell junctions and eventually affects cell membrane integrity. Drugs commonly used to treat inflammatory bowel disease do not inhibit carrageenan injury in this cell model system, although catalase does decrease injury.\r"

Intraluminal pressures in the ileocolonic region were recorded in 18 healthy human volunteers after instillation of boluses of SCFAs, air, and saline. Ileal motility was stimulated more often by SCFAs than by similar volumes of air or saline. Although increasing volumes of distention evoked greater numbers of contractions, this phenomenon was not apparent after repeated stimulation, suggesting that the \"mechanoreceptor\" in the human ileum has a refractory period. Symptoms of abdominal pain, cramps, and an urge to defecate may have resulted from instillation of SCFAs, even at small volumes. The motility stimulated in the ileum by SCFAs was not associated with systemic release of gastrointestinal regulatory peptides and was not affected by naloxone or indomethacin. Short-chain fatty acids, which can be considered as \"markers\" of colonic contents, might be associated with the motor response to coloileal reflux in humans.\r"

In a series of 28 sequential patients found to have microscopic changes characteristic of sprue on biopsy, distinctive endoscopic changes were found in 22 (in 6 of 9 with sprue in relapse, and 16 of 19 presenting with initial symptoms). The finding of the distinctive appearance provides an endoscopically recognizable pattern that can be associated with sprue. It also provides the potential for early recognition of the process in patients in whom the diagnosis might otherwise have been delayed due to a lack of substantial evolution of the usually associated symptom complex.\r"

The objective of this study was to define the role of neutrophils in the colonic hyperemia associated with acetic acid-induced colitis in rats. One, two, and five days after the acetic acid enema, the colon was separated into five segments. Regional blood flow to each segment was measured using the radioactive microsphere technique. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used as an index of neutrophil infiltration. Rectal blood flow and myeloperoxidase activity increased progressively after the acetic acid enema. At 5 days there were 3.9- and 4.6-fold increases in myeloperoxidase activity and blood flow, respectively. Comparable changes were noted in all bowel segments. The results suggest a temporal relationship between colonic blood flow and the extent of neutrophil infiltration. To assess directly the role of circulating and infiltrated neutrophils as mediators of the colitis-induced hyperemia, animals were rendered neutropenic approximately 8 h before the enema and neutropenia was maintained for another 24 h. Neutropenia did not modify the colitis-induced intestinal hyperemia normally observed at 24 h. We conclude from these findings that vasoactive agents derived from neutrophils do not mediate the increased colonic blood flow in this model of ulcerative colitis.\r"

Their 12 affected family members comprise the largest Peutz-Jeghers kindred reported. The course of this family illustrates that Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is not a benign disease. One family member developed a duodenal carcinoma in a hamartoma with adenomatous changes; this progression in the duodenum has not previously been reported. Ten patients underwent 75 polypectomies. One patient developed short bowel syndrome. Three patients died in young adulthood. The development of gastrointestinal malignancy in 2 of 12 affected patients suggests that Peutz-Jeghers syndrome may be a premalignant condition. Consequently, even asymptomatic gastric, duodenal, and colonic polyps should be removed endoscopically. If surgical intervention is necessary, intraoperative endoscopy with polypectomy may prevent the development of a short bowel syndrome. Colonoscopic screening of patients and their family members may be beneficial and surveillance for extraintestinal malignancy appears to be warranted.\r"

Nude mice bearing xenografts of colon cancer CX1 or X56 were treated for 14-25 days subcutaneously with saline, pentagastrin (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg), proglumide (250 or 500 mg/kg), or somatostatin 14 (33, 100, or 300 micrograms/kg) twice daily. Tumor volume, weight, protein, and deoxyribonucleic acid were measured. HT29 cells were grown in vitro and the effects of gastrin 17, proglumide, and somatostatin on growth were evaluated by cell counts or [3H]thymidine incorporation. The larger dose of pentagastrin significantly increased tumor growth in the nude mouse (p less than 0.005) and gastrin induced a biphasic effect on deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in tissue culture with significant increases of up to 39% (p less than 0.025). Somatostatin alone significantly inhibited tumor growth in two of the cell lines and also inhibited the gastrin-induced growth. Proglumide had no effect by itself but significantly inhibited gastrin-stimulated growth. These findings suggest that growth of some human colon cancers may be hormone-dependent.\r"

Crypt cell numbers and crypt cell proliferation rates, using the vincristine-induced metaphase arrest technique, now have been measured in the colon of aging and young Fischer 344 rats. The proximal colon of 26-28-mo-old unfasted rats had 10% more crypt cells and a higher proliferative rate than 3-4-mo-old young controls. In the distal colon, the crypt cell proliferation rate in aging rats was 56% greater than in the young. A 3-day fast reduced crypt cell proliferation about fourfold in young rats but only by 20% in aging rats. One-day refeeding abruptly increased the crypt cell population and proliferation rate in rats of both age groups. The crypt zone of proliferating cells from aging rats was broader than that seen in young rats. In addition, starvation lowered colonic crypt cell cycling rate much less in aging than in young animals. We conclude that the colons of aging rats demonstrate a hyperproliferative state and a failure to adapt appropriately to changes in food intake. These observations may be relevant to states of altered proliferation that occur in the premalignant colon.\r"

Fecal water samples from 62 patients with ulcerative colitis were analyzed in the present investigation to evaluate changes in SCFAs and lactic acid in relation to activity and severity of disease. Short-chain fatty acid levels were high in quiescent and mild disease (162.6 +/- 63.6 and 147.8 +/- 63.2 mM/L, respectively), but significantly decreased in the severe form (64.7 +/- 46.9 mM/L). Lactate showed a progressive increase from mild colitis (3.0 +/- 1.8 mM/L) to severe colitis (21.4 +/- 18.6 mM/L). It thus appears that mild colitis displayed a fecal pattern characterized by normal pH and bicarbonate, slightly impaired electrolyte handling, high short-chain fatty acid values, and only moderately increased lactate. Severe colitis, on the other hand, was characterized by low fecal pH, bicarbonate, and potassium, high sodium and chloride, low short-chain fatty acid levels, and very high lactate levels. A critical lowering of intraluminal pH, which shifts bacterial metabolism from short-chain fatty acid to lactate production, may be responsible for the intraluminal pooling of lactate.\r"

Twenty-seven guinea pigs (group 5, negative control) were either intubated gastrically with phosphate-buffered saline or given drinking water without L. pneumophila. Sixty-six of 115 (57%) of the guinea pigs orally inoculated with viable L. pneumophila (groups 1 and 2) had a temperature greater than or equal to 103 degrees F and 8 of 115 (7%) had diarrhea, compared with 0 of 19 (0%) and 0 of 19 (0%), respectively, in group 3 and 1 of 27 (4%) and 0 of 27 (0%), respectively, in group 5.

In this model, C. parvum causes extensive infiltration of the liver with activated macrophages, but severe liver injury occurs only after subsequent exposure to endotoxin. We have therefore investigated the effects of endotoxin on the release of reactive oxygen intermediates by C. parvum-activated hepatic macrophages. After in vitro exposure to zymosan, opsonized zymosan, or phorbol myristate acetate, hepatic macrophages isolated from C. parvum- and endotoxin-treated rats demonstrated significantly (1.5-2-fold) increased release of superoxide and oxidation of [1-14C]glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt compared with hepatic macrophages isolated from C. parvum- and saline-treated control rats. These results indicate that endotoxin enhances the state of activation of hepatic macrophages already partially activated by C. parvum. We suggest that the increased release of reactive oxygen intermediates by these cells promotes liver injury in this model.\r"

However, sphincterotomy alters emptying dynamics of the gallbladder and markedly reduces bile salt pool size, effects that may alter response to chenodeoxycholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid treatment. Studying two groups of 5 patients with an intact gallbladder after endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy, we found that 15 mg/kg.day of chenodeoxycholic acid increased the mean (+/- SEM) biliary percentage of chenodeoxycholic acid from 35.5% +/- 4.0% to 88.8% +/- 1.9% (p less than 0.01) and decreased the mean saturation index of gallbladder bile from 1.02 +/- 0.22 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.05).

The receptors of portal veins of sham-operated rats had the same affinity for ICI 169,369 as the receptors of portal hypertensive rats. The systemic administration of ICI 169,369 to portal hypertensive rats decreased portal pressure from 13.0 +/- 0.4 to 11.3 +/- 0.5 mmHg (p less than 0.01) but did not affect arterial pressure. ICI 169,369 induced nonsignificant changes in both portal venous inflow and portocollateral resistance, as estimated by the radioactive microsphere technique. It is estimated that the combined changes in portal flow and resistance could explain the decrease in portal pressure. The results are consistent with an involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine, acting through 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptors, in prehepatic portal hypertension.\r"

After diversion the volume of zymogen granules decreased markedly, representing a reduction of 77%. The volume of autophagic vacuoles increased twofold after diversion. The volume of rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus was not different from that of control. It has been proved by electron microscopic morphometry that the degree of reduction of zymogen granules was similar to that after stimulation by exogenous cholecystokinin or introduction of trypsin inhibitor to the duodenum. This suggests that hypersecretion caused by diversion is due to failure of a negative feedback regulation normally induced by proteases found in pancreatic juice. An increased number of autophagic vacuoles suggests an increase of organelle turnover due to heightened secretory activity of acinar cells.\r"

Uptake of 99mTc-Disofenin was unaffected by removal of NaCl from medium, suggesting that its transport did not proceed by the primary high-affinity uptake pathways associated with sulfobromophthalein and taurocholate, which require Cl- and Na+, respectively. 99mTc-Mebrofenin uptake was inhibited only modestly by taurocholate, deoxycholate, and bilirubin (p less than 0.05) and 99mTc-Arclofenin uptake was not inhibited by the organic anions studied. These results suggest that 99mTc-Mebrofenin and 99mTc-Arclofenin might be advantageous for cholescintigraphy in severely jaundiced patients. The relatively simple in vitro methodology described in this study may be useful in the design and screening of potential new agents before proceeding to animal studies or clinical trials.\r"

Arachidonic acid, by an indomethacin-sensitive mechanism, is known to enhance gallbladder mucus release, suggesting that prostaglandins may regulate gallbladder epithelial release of mucus. In this study, the glycoprotein granules of the principal cells of the mouse gallbladder epithelium were morphometrically analyzed using electron microscopy. It was shown that 5 micrograms of prostaglandin E2, injected into the gallbladder lumen of the anesthetized mouse, reduced the relative volume of glycoprotein granules from 3.0% to 0.7% of the cytoplasmic volume within 20 min, whereas injection of the same amount of the solvent for prostaglandin E2 had no such effect.\r"

A model system has been developed utilizing flexible videosigmoidoscopy performed by nurse practitioners with videotape review by physician endoscopists. Of the 100 patients studied, 36 were found to have polyps. Near excellent concordance (k = 0.72) was observed between the nurse practitioner's findings and those of the physician. Using the physician's review as the standard, overall sensitivity and specificity of the nurse practitioner's examinations were 75% and 94%, respectively. In conclusion, videosigmoidoscopy performed by nurse practitioners and reviewed by physician endoscopists is a feasible approach to colorectal cancer screening since it is safe, provides videotape documentation to ensure quality control, and expands available resources for the performance of this examination.\r"

The incidence of cholangitis following stent insertion was significantly lower with 10 FG stents, 3 (5%), compared with 8 FG stents, 13 (34%), p less than 0.001, chi 2. Stent survival until blockage was significantly longer for 10 FG (median 32 weeks) compared with 8 FG (median 12 weeks), p less than 0.001, log-rank. The superior performance of the 10 FG stents was due to their larger diameter which gives them a flow capacity much greater than the physiological bile flow. We recommend that stents of at least 10 FG diameter are used for the endoscopic palliation of biliary obstruction due to malignancy.\r"

During the subsequent 24 h of study (period D), 10 sheep received parenteral ibuprofen, 12.5 mg/kg every 6 h, and 13 sheep served as untreated septic controls. Throughout period D, a progressive increase in QL (16.2 +/- 16.3 ml/60 min) from period S was greater in the untreated than in the ibuprofen (2.5 +/- 9.0 ml/60 min, P less than 0.02) group. Between base line and period D, increase in lung wet-to-dry weight ratios was greater in the untreated group than in the ibuprofen group (P less than 0.05). Concurrently mean pulmonary arterial pressure increased 4.7 +/- 7.3 mmHg in the untreated group (P less than 0.05) during period D vs. 0.0 +/- 5.2 mmHg in the ibuprofen group (NS). When administered after septic ALI had been established by CLP, ibuprofen reduced an otherwise progressive increase in both fluid flux and extravascular lung water.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of acute bilateral vagotomy on ventilation and ventilatory pattern in rats. In 1- to 6-day-old unanesthetized rats, vagotomy resulted in a substantial decrease (38%) in ventilation during air breathing. After vagotomy there was a threefold increase in tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI) doubled, and expiratory time (TE) was six times longer. When studied under isoflurane anesthesia, newborn rats showed decreases in ventilation similar to that observed without anesthesia, whereas anesthetized adult rats had no consistent changes in ventilation. Adult and newborn rats had nearly identical proportionate increases in VT and TI after vagotomy, but TE lengthened to a greater extent in the newborns. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant decrease in ventilation when 100% O2 rather than air was supplied to nonvagotomized unanesthetized newborn rats. Ventilation decreased by 19% after vagotomy under hyperoxic conditions. We conclude that vagal afferent input, probably of pulmonary mechanoreceptor origin, provides positive feedback to respiration in newborn rats and that newborn rats greater than 24 h old also have a degree of peripheral chemoreceptor drive during air breathing.\r"

The younger animals had lower maximum inspiratory pressures (MIP) and markedly greater falls in pressure during sustained diaphragmatic contractions at greater than 40% MIP than did the older animals. Histological analysis showed a paucity of high-oxidative type I fibers in the diaphragms of the young animals. We therefore conclude that the newborn rabbit diaphragm is extremely susceptible to fatigue and that this susceptibility correlates with the distribution of muscle fiber types.\r"

On one occasion, leg blood flow was occluded with surgical thigh cuffs placed below the buttocks and inflated to 200 mmHg. The protocol consisted of a 10-min rest, 12 min of exercise at 40% peak O2 consumption (VO2 peak), and a 28-min resting recovery while respiratory gas exchange was determined breath by breath. Occlusion (OCC) spanned min 6-8 during the 12-min work bout and elicited mean blood lactate of 5.2 +/- 0.8 mM, which was 380% greater than control (CON). During 18 min of recovery, blood lactate after OCC remained significantly above CON values. VO2 was significantly lower during exercise with OCC compared with CON but was significantly higher during the 4 min of exercise after cuff release. VO2 was higher after OCC during the first 4 min of recovery but was not significantly different thereafter. Neither total recovery VO2 (gross recovery VO2 with no base-line subtraction) nor excess postexercise VO2 (net recovery VO2 above an asymptotic base line) was significantly different for OCC and CON conditions (13.71 +/- 0.45 vs. 13.44 +/- 0.61 liters and 4.93 +/- 0.26 vs. 4.17 +/- 0.35 liters, respectively). Manipulation of exercise blood lactate levels had no significant effect on the slow (\"lactacid\") component of the recovery VO2.\r"

To investigate the mechanism of this impairment of gas exchange we studied 13 piglets from 12 to 65 days of age. Two days after instrumentation we measured the distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios (VA/Q) by use of the multiple inert gas technique on awake animals. We showed that PaO2 is lower in young animals, increasing from 72 +/- 11.5 Torr before 2 wk to 102 Torr at 2 mo. This hypoxemia is due to an enlarged alveolar-arterial O2 pressure difference that significantly decreases with age. This impairment in gas exchange is not due to shunting (0.6 +/- 1.3%). Mean dead space (36 +/- 11%) was not related to age. Mean modes of perfusion and ventilation did not differ significantly between age groups. However, the dispersion of perfusion as expressed by its logSD decreased significantly with age, whereas dispersion of ventilation remained constant. Furthermore, in the young animals only, a significant difference was evidenced between measured alveolar-arterial PO2 gradient and the value predicted by the inert gas model. We therefore conclude that the impairment of gas exchange in piglets is due to two mechanisms: VA/Q mismatch and diffusion limitation for O2.\r"

On occasions greater than 2 wk apart the sheep were treated with 1) placebo aerosol (buffered saline) before and 3 h after antigen challenge, 2) an aerosol of nedocromil sodium (1 mg/kg in 3 ml buffered saline) before antigen challenge and placebo 3 h after challenge, and 3) placebo aerosol before and nedocromil sodium aerosol 3 h after challenge. Early and late bronchial responses were determined by measuring specific lung resistance (sRL) before and periodically after challenge. Airway responsiveness was assessed by determining from dose-response curves the carbachol concentration (in % wt/vol) that increased sRL to 5 cmH2O/s. In the placebo trial, antigen challenge resulted in early and late increases in sRL over a base line of 353 +/- 32 and 131 +/- 17% (SE), respectively. Both early and late increases in sRL were blocked (P less than 0.05) when the sheep were pretreated with nedocromil sodium. When nedocromil was given after the early response, the late response was reduced significantly. Eight of nine sheep developed airway hyperresponsiveness 24 h after antigen challenge. In these eight sheep, carbachol concentration before antigen challenge was 2.6 +/- 0.3%, 24 h later carbachol concentration was significantly lower (1.8 +/- 0.3%). Both nedocromil sodium treatments blocked (P less than 0.05) this antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Detailed analysis of the types of reflex responses revealed that there are at least six different responses: 1) the apneic reflex, 2) the expiration reflex, 3) spasmodic, panting breathing, 4) the cough reflex, 5) slowing of breathing, and 6) rapid, shallow breathing. Among these reflex responses, the cough reflex was the most sensitive and the apneic reflex followed by slowing of breathing was the most resistant to deepening anesthesia, whereas the sensitivity of other types of reflex responses was in between. Our results indicate that the types of respiratory reflex responses to tracheal mucosa stimulation are associated with depths of anesthesia and that the differences in sensitivity to anesthesia may be a valuable sign in clinical assessment of depth of anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the changes in O2 consumption (VO2), vascular resistance, and tension development during skeletal muscle contractions at reduced flow. We tested the hypothesis that when VO2 is limited by O2 supply, the skeletal muscle vasculature is not maximally dilated because of the fall in contractile force that accompanies the decrease in O2 supply. During 30 min of ischemic contractions, tension fell by 45 +/- 4% and VO2 fell 54 +/- 1% from preischemic levels. The O2 cost per unit tension did not change compared with nonischemic muscles. After the initial flow reduction, flow fell an additional 16 +/- 3% over 30 min. Adenosine infusion after 30 min of ischemic contractions increased flow by 42 +/- 3% but increased VO2 by only 9.8 +/- 2.3% and had no effect on tension development. When perfusion pressure was returned to normal after 30 min of ischemic contractions, twitch tension did not begin to recover within 20 min but tetanic tension showed a small improvement. VO2, although increased, remained well below the preischemic level. These results suggest that because of the reduced tension during ischemic contractions, the O2 supply-to-consumption ratio is nearly normal, which could explain the presence of the vasodilator reserve. The defect in tension development is long lived, producing a \"stunned\" muscle in which excess O2 supply does not restore function or VO2 to normal.\r"

Subjects were matched with respect to maximum O2 consumption, body size, and body composition, and were thoroughly heat acclimated before participation. Randomly ordered concentrations of acetyl-beta-methylcholine chloride ranging from 0% (saline) to 0.1% (5 x 10(-3) M) were injected into the skin of the dorsal thigh in a thermoneutral environment, and activated sweat glands were photographed at 30-s intervals for the next 8 min. Density of MCh-activated glands was independent of both age and [MCh] (e.g., 2 min after injection of 5 x 10(-3) M [MCh]: Y = 45 +/- 7, M = 46 +/- 12, O = 42 +/- 5 glands/cm2). However, sweat gland output (SGO) per active gland was significantly lower for the O group and failed to increase with increasing [MCh] above 5 x 10(-4) M.

Stimulation of pulmonary C-fiber receptors by injection of capsaicin (3-20 micrograms/kg) into the right atrium resulted in complete cessation of electrical activity of the upper airway dilating muscles (UADM) and the inspiratory chest wall pumping muscles. The activity of abdominal muscles was also inhibited. The duration of electrical silence was longer for the diaphragm than for the UADM. Upper airway constricting muscles and expiratory intercostal muscles, including the triangularis sterni, remained tonically active during the apneic period. The responses of these muscles were qualitatively the same when the animals breathed 100% O2, 7% CO2 in O2, or 12% O2 in N2, and without or in the presence of an expiratory threshold load. Bilateral vagotomy abolished the inhibitory effects of capsaicin on UADM, chest wall, and abdominal muscle activity, suggesting that the vagus is the major afferent pathway for the reflex. The qualitative difference in the response of intercostal expiratory muscles and abdominal muscles suggests that these two groups of synergistic muscles may be independently regulated.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of pulmonary mechanics has been developed extensively for adults, and these techniques have been applied directly to neonates and infants. However, the compliant chest wall of the infant frequently predisposes to chest wall distortion, especially when there is a low dynamic lung compliance (CL,dyn). We describe a technique of directly measuring the static chest wall compliance (Cw,st), developed initially in the newborn lamb and subsequently applied to the premature neonate with chest wall distortion. The mean CL,dyn in seven intubated newborn lambs in normoxia was 2.45 +/- 0.41 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1, whereas Cw,st was 11.81 +/- 0.25 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1. These values did not change significantly in seven animals breathing through a tight-fitting face mask or with hypercapnia-induced tachypnea. For the eight premature infants the mean CL,dyn was 1.35 +/- 0.36 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1, whereas the mean Cw,st was 3.16 +/- 1.01 ml.cmH2O-1.kg-1. This study shows that, under relaxed conditions when measurements of static compliance are performed, the chest wall is more compliant than the lung. The measurement of Cw,st may thus be used to determine the contribution of the respiratory musculature in stabilizing the chest wall.\r"

  ".W": "Glutamic acid is an excitatory neurotransmitter that may have a significant role in the central chemical drive of ventilation. Therefore cardiorespiratory function was measured in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs before and after central inhibition of glutamate metabolism by means of methionine sulfoximine (MSO), a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthase (GS) catalyzing amidation of glutamate to glutamine. GS was inhibited centrally by perfusing the ventriculocisternal space with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 92.5 mmol MSO per liter at a fixed pH, perfusion rate, and pressure. After GS inhibition, CSF transfer rate of [13N]glutamine synthesized from 13NH4+ amidation of glutamate was reduced five-fold, and minute ventilation increased from 2.90 +/- 0.41 (SE) l/min (0.164 +/- 0.020 l.min-1.kg body wt-1) to 4.46 +/- 0.52 l/min (0.254 +/- 0.029 l.min-1.kg body wt-1). This increase in ventilation with endogenous glutamate and the increase in ventilation previously observed during ventriculocisternal perfusion of exogenous glutamate are compared quantitatively via a model of central neurotransmitter glutamate chemoreception. The results support the hypothesis that the endogenous brain glutamate is important in the central chemical drive of ventilation.\r"

Physical parameters such as density and heat conductivity of the various tissues and variables such as blood flow and metabolic heat production of different organs are spatially distributed and thereby influence the temperature profiles within the human body. Actual physiological knowledge allows one to take into account up to 54 different spatially distributed values for each parameter. An adequate representation of the anatomy of the body requires a spatial three-dimensional grid of at least 0.5-1.0 cm. This is achieved by photogrammetric treatment of three-dimensional anatomic models of the human body. As a first essential result, the simulation system has produced a realistic picture of the topography of temperatures under neutral conditions. Compatibility of reality and simulation was achieved solely on the basis of physical considerations and physiological data base. Therefore the simulation is suited to the extrapolation of temperature profiles that cannot be obtained experimentally.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of nedocromil sodium given as an aerosol on the immediate lung hyperreactivity and lung inflammation caused by a 2-h exposure to 400 ppm SO2 has been studied in dogs. Exposure to SO2 caused an immediate increase in bronchial responsiveness to histamine aerosol that lasted for approximately 2 h. The total number of cells recovered by bronchial lavage increased postexposure. Initially this increase was caused by epithelial cells (0.25 and 1 h) and later by neutrophils (1, 2, 3, and 4 h). There was no significant change in the numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, eosinophils, goblet cells, or mast cells in the lavages. Nedocromil sodium (approximately 8 mg) given as a nebulized aerosol before and after SO2 exposure prevented the increase in lung reactivity and attenuated the increase in the total number of cells (epithelial cells and neutrophils) in the lung lavages for the 4 h after exposure. Nedocromil sodium did not affect the reactivity of normal dogs to histamine aerosol. Nedocromil sodium appears to act as an anti-inflammatory agent in this model of lung inflammation, preventing an increase in lung reactivity and reducing cell infiltration. The mechanism of action of nedocromil sodium in this model is unknown.\r"

In 13 subjects, a range of doses of capsaicin inhaled in single breaths given in random order produced a reproducible dose-cough response. Inhalation of a dose of capsaicin that caused fewer than two coughs increased Rrs by 28% (21-35, mean 95% confidence interval). Inhaled codeine (50 mg) and morphine (10 mg) did not alter the cough response. In contrast, both drugs increased base-line Rrs by 24% (16-44) and 13% (3-23), respectively, and significantly reduced the increase in Rrs after inhaled capsaicin (P less than 0.05). Oral codeine (60 mg) significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the number of coughs at 1 and 2 h but did not alter base-line Rrs or its increase after capsaicin. Intravenous morphine (0.15 mg/kg) significantly reduced the sensitivity of the cough response (P less than 0.05), which was reversed by naloxone. However, there was no significant drug effect on either the base-line Rrs or its increase after capsaicin. Systemic dosing of opiates is therefore required to reduce the cough reflex, whereas inhaled opiates may reduce the increase in Rrs after inhaled capsaicin.\r"

Both methods can be performed in unanesthetized sheep. The pulmonary arterial occlusion method is less costly and requires fewer calculations. The double microsphere method requires less surgical preparation and allows measurement without perturbation of pulmonary hemodynamics. There was no statistically significant difference between bronchial blood flow measured with the two methods. However, total bronchial blood flow measured during pulmonary arterial occlusion (1.52 +/- 0.98% of cardiac output, n = 9) was slightly higher than that measured with the double microsphere method (1.39 +/- 0.88% of cardiac output, n = 9). In another series of experiments in which sequential measurements of bronchial blood flow were made, there was a significant increase of 15% in left lung bronchial blood flow during the first minute of occlusion of the left pulmonary artery. Thus pulmonary arterial occlusion should be performed 5 s after microsphere injection as originally described by Baile et al. (1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To characterize the mechanisms involved, left atrial pressure was increased in two stages (approximately 10 and approximately 25 mmHg).

  ".W": "A progressive decline in maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) expressed traditionally as per kilogram body weight generally occurs with advancing age. To investigate the extent to which this decline could be attributable to the age-associated loss of metabolically active tissue, i.e., muscle, we measured 24-h urinary creatinine excretion, an index of muscle mass, in 184 healthy nonobese volunteers, ages 22-87 yr, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who had achieved a true VO2max during graded treadmill exercise. A positive correlation was found between VO2max and creatinine excretion in both men (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001) and women (r = 0.47, P less than 0.001). As anticipated, VO2max showed a strong negative linear relationship with age in both men and women. Creatinine excretion also declined with age in men and women. When VO2max was normalized for creatinine excretion, the variance in the VO2max decline attributable to age declined from 60 to 14% in men and from 50 to 8% in women. Thus comparing the standard age regression of VO2max per kilogram body weight with that in which VO2max is normalized per milligram creatinine excretion, the decline in VO2max between a hypothetical 30 yr old and a 70 yr old was reduced from 39 to 18% in men and from 30 to 14% in women. We conclude that in both sexes, a large portion of the age-associated decline in VO2max in non-endurance-trained individuals is explicable by the loss of muscle mass, which is observed with advancing age.\r"

The carotid body was vascularly isolated and perfused at aortic pressure with blood of varied PO2 and PCO2. The viability of our preparation was assessed by the occurrence of a bradycardia in response to carotid body stimulation, and only data from animals demonstrating a bradycardia were analyzed. During hypoxic perfusion of the carotid body, heart rate decreased 6% (P less than 0.05). Bronchial blood flow increased by 46% and bronchial vascular resistance decreased by 23%, both of which were significant changes (P less than 0.05). During control experiments in which the carotid body was perfused with normoxic blood, there were no significant (P greater than 0.05) changes in any of the parameters. These data suggest that carotid body stimulation results in a reflex bronchial vasodilation.\r"

With isocapnic hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation 80 +/- 2%) mean ventilation increased at 5 min and then declined, so that at 25 min values did not differ from those on room air. After 3 min of O2 breathing, ventilation was greater than that on room air or after 25 min of isocapnic hypoxia, whether the hyperoxia had been preceded by hypoxia or normoxia. During transitions to pure O2 breathing, ventilation was analyzed breath by breath with a moving average technique, searching for nadirs before and after increases in PO2. After both 5 and 25 min of hypoxia, O2 breathing was associated with transient depressions of ventilation, which were greater after 25 min than after 5 min. Significant depressions were not observed when hyperoxia followed room air breathing, and O2-induced nadirs after hypoxia were lower than those observed during room air breathing. O2 transiently depressed ventilation after hypoxia but not after room air breathing. These results suggest that the normal ventilatory response to isocapnic hypoxia has two components, an excitatory one from peripheral chemoreceptors, which is turned off by O2 breathing, and a slower inhibitory one, probably of central origin, which is affected less promptly by O2 breathing.\r"

Lack of a clearly suitable animal model has impeded understanding of this condition. RDCS, unaccompanied by central nervous system signs, occurred in 17 of 18 unanesthetized sheep exposed to compressed air at 230 kPa (2.27 ATA) for 22 h, returned to normal pressure for approximately 40 min, and taken to simulated altitude (0.75 ATA, 570 Torr). Respiratory signs, including tachypnea, sporadic apnea, and labored breathing, were accompanied by precordial Doppler ultrasound evidence of marked venous bubble loading. Pulmonary arterial pressures exceeded 30 Torr in five catheterized sheep that died or became moribund. Hypoxemia (arterial Po2 less than 40 Torr), neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were observed. Peribronchovascular edema was the most prominent necropsy finding. Chest radiography indicated interstitial edema in most affected sheep. High body weight and catheterization predisposed the sheep to severe RDCS. It appears that this protocol reliably provides a useful animal model for studies of RDCS and obstructive pulmonary hypertension, that the precipitating event is massive pulmonary embolization by bubbles, and that venous bubbles, detected by Doppler ultrasound, can signal impending RDCS.\r"

The tidal volume and frequency used were 1.5 ml/kg body wt and 20 Hz, respectively. LHI was observed during HFO in all cases except for a few trials with He. The degree of LHI was inversely related to mean tracheal pressure and varied directly with gas density. Maximum expiratory flow rate (Vmax) was measured during forced expiration induced by a vacuum source (-150 cmH2O) at the trachea. Vmax was consistently higher than the peak oscillatory flow rate (Vosc) during HFO, demonstrating that overall expiratory flow limitation did not cause LHI in isolated dog lungs. Asymmetry of inspiratory and expiratory impedances seems to be one cause of LHI, although other factors are involved.\r"

We found that 1) the total volume and vascular compliance of the fibrotic LLL were five and four times less, respectively, than controls, 2) the slope and intercept of the P-Q curves in the LLL were 154.0 +/- 65.8 (SE) mmHg.l-1.min-1 and 8.2 +/- 1.5 mmHg, respectively, compared with 18.3 +/- 2.3 and 3.2 +/- 0.9 for the RLL, 3) the resistance of the arterial, middle, and venous segments in the LLL were higher than in the RLL, but middle segment resistance rose disproportionately, and 4) constriction of the arterial segment with serotonin was similar in LLL and RLL, and vasodilators were ineffective. Histologically, fibrosis involved 36% of the lung, and the capillary bed was severely obliterated. Arteries showed an increased percentage of medial and intimal thickening and peripheral muscularization; venous abnormalities were less marked. We conclude that pulmonary fibrosis increases vascular resistance mainly in the middle segment, largely by loss of tissue and obliteration of the microvasculature.\r"

Furthermore total fiber number was not changed, whereas fibers containing the intermediate isoenzyme and those classified as type IIa increased. There results could be explained by either a change in the composition within existing fibers or a simultaneous loss of slow fibers and de novo synthesis of intermediate and fast fibers. Evidence for transformation included an absence of embryonic or neonatal myosin in muscles from suspended rats and the constant fiber number that was unchanged by 4 wk of suspension. Furthermore although fiber areas of both groups of type I and IIa fibers declined during suspension, variability of the fiber areas within each group did not increase.\r"

We hypothesized that the mucus mass is moved by the difference between expiratory and inspiratory velocities. The rate of transport of a layer of simulated mucus lining the bottom of a rectangular trough was measured in two ways during oscillatory air flow. Peak velocity ratios (R) from 1.0 to 2.0, frequencies (f) between 7 and 13 Hz, and tidal volumes (VT) between 50 and 100 ml were generated by a custom-made pump. The experimental results demonstrate that measuring the displacement of a tracer deposited on the surface of the mucus layer is equivalent to measuring bulk mucus movement by weight. Moreover the measured mucus velocities (micron) correlate well with a theoretical model which predicts that micron is proportional to delta VT f1.5 (R-1). These results suggest that shearing at the air-mucus interface could be a significant factor in the enhanced tracheal mucus clearance during high-frequency chest wall oscillation.\r"

Fourteen unanesthetized adult sheep with chronic lung lymph fistula were given Escherichia coli endotoxin (1 microgram/kg) over 30 min. Seven sheep were given catalase (32,500 U/kg body wt) as an intravenous bolus 30 min before endotoxin. Four sheep were given catalase alone. Oxidant lung changes were measured using arterial plasma conjugated dienes and lung tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) content, both reflecting the lipid peroxidation process. Animals were killed 5 h after endotoxin. We found that endotoxin alone caused an early increase in pulmonary arterial pressure lung lymph flow (QL), plasma thromboxane B2, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and plasma conjugated dienes. A decrease in cardiac output and arterial PO2 was also seen. A three- to four-fold increase in protein-rich QL was noted at 3-4 h as well as a continued increase in arterial conjugated dienes. Lung MDA and water content were also significantly increased from base line. Catalase pretreatment significantly attenuated both the physiological changes and the prostanoid and conjugated diene release. Lung MDA and water content also remained at base line. We conclude that H2O2 plays a major role in endotoxin-induced lung injury as well as the resulting lipid peroxidation process.\r"

Using a combination of physiological and morphological techniques, the number of RBC and granulocytes in each vessel size was obtained by dividing the aggregate volume of the cell by the calculated volume of a single cell. The data show that the average transit time was 0.60 s in large vessels, 0.10 s in small vessels, and 1.37 s in capillary vessels and was longer (P less than 0.05) in the upper lung regions for small vessels and capillaries. RBCs pass through approximately 60 capillary segments at an average velocity of approximately 550 micron/s. Pulmonary hematocrit averaged 0.95 of the systemic hematocrit and was lower in capillaries than small vessels. PMN's were concentrated approximately 10-fold in the small vessels and 100-fold in the capillaries compared with peripheral blood. The multisegmented nature of the capillary bed allows this concentration because RBCs find pathways to stream around the slower moving PMNs.\r"

  ".W": "Increases in central venous pressure and arterial pressure have been reported to have variable effects on normal arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels in healthy humans. To test the hypothesis that baroreceptor suppression of AVP secretion might be more likely if AVP were subjected to a prior osmotic stimulus, we investigated the response of plasma AVP to increased central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure after hypertonic saline in six normal volunteers. Plasma AVP, serum osmolality, heart rate, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and pulse pressure were assessed before and after a 0.06 ml.kg-1.min-1-infusion of 5% saline give over 90 min and then after 10 min of 30 degrees head-down tilt and 10 min of head-down tilt plus lower-body positive pressure. Hypertonic saline increased plasma AVP. After head-down tilt, which did not change heart rate, pulse pressure, or mean arterial pressure but did increase central venous pressure, plasma AVP fell. Heart rate, pulse pressure, and central venous pressure were unchanged from head-down tilt values during lower-body positive pressure, whereas mean arterial pressure increased. Plasma AVP during lower-body positive pressure was not different from that during tilt. Osmolality increased during the saline infusion but was stable throughout the remainder of the study. These data therefore suggest that an osmotically stimulated plasma AVP level can be suppressed by baroreflex activation. Either the low-pressure cardiopulmonary receptors (subjected to a rise in central venous pressure during head-down tilt) or the sinoaortic baroreceptors (subjected to hydrostatic effects during head-down tilt) could have been responsible for the suppression of AVP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The morphological and histochemical properties of the rat soleus were studied after 1 wk of hindlimb suspension, one model that removes the weight-bearing function of the hindlimbs. To examine the effectiveness of weight support activity in maintaining soleus mass, fiber size, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, the hindlimbs of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were suspended (HS) and half of these rats were walked on a treadmill for 40 min/day (10 min every 6 h) at 5 m/min and a 19 degree grade (HS-WS). Significant reductions in soleus mass and fiber size were found after 1 wk of HS. Weight support activity decreased the atrophic response by approximately 50%. In the alkaline myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) dark-staining fibers, SDH activity was higher in the HS than control rats, whereas it was similar to control in the HS-WS rats. Total SDH activity (SDH activity X cross-sectional area) in fibers staining lightly for ATPase in HS and HS-WS rats was lower than in control rats, whereas in the darkly stained ATPase fibers it was similar among the three groups. No changes were observed in fiber type percentages after 1 wk of HS or HS-WS. The results suggest that short-duration, daily weight support activity can ameliorate, but not prevent, soleus atrophy induced by HS. Furthermore, fiber cross-sectional area is more responsive to periodic weight support in dark than light ATPase fibers. These results also demonstrate that muscle fiber atrophy need not be associated with a loss in SDH activity.\r"

This study tested the hypothesis that airway hyperresponsiveness after inhalation of ozone in dogs results from an inability to produce EpDRF. Two groups of five dogs each were studied; one group inhaled ozone, the other dry room air. Ozone-treated dogs developed airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas the control group did not. The acetylcholine provocative concentration decreased from 4.17 (%SE 1.35) to 0.56 mg/ml (%SE 1.24) (P = 0.0006) in the ozone-treated dogs and was 18.76 (%SE 2.04) and 29.77 mg/ml (%SE 2.07) in the air-treated dogs (P = 0.47). In vitro the presence of airway epithelium reduced the constrictor responses to acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, and KCl in trachealis strips from the control dogs. This effect of epithelium was still present in trachealis strips from dogs with airway hyperresponsiveness. These results demonstrate that EpDRF is released from canine tracheal epithelium, that this function is not impaired in dogs with airway hyperresponsiveness after inhaled ozone, and that loss of EpDRF is not responsible for the development of airway hyperresponsiveness after inhaled ozone in dogs.\r"

For comparison, we also studied the well-characterized C6 glioma cell line (C6). Both human and bovine endothelial cells showed specific saturable binding of [125I]iodopindolol. There was no difference in the binding affinity (KD) of iodopindolol to membranes from the three cell types. However, the beta-receptor density (Bmax) was greater on HIVE cells and BFAE cells than on C6 cells. Displacement of ligand from HIVE and BFAE cells by zinterol or from BFAE cells by ICI 89,406 was consistent with binding to the beta 2-subtype. In contrast, displacement of ligand from C6 cells by zinterol or ICI 89,406 was consistent with binding to both beta 1- and beta 2-subtypes. Exposing BFAE cells in culture to 10 microM isoproterenol for 6 h resulted in a 55% decrease in Bmax without a change in KD. We conclude that 1) human and bovine endothelial cells in culture contain a substantial population of beta-adrenergic receptors, which are predominantly of the beta 2-subtype, and 2) endothelial beta-receptors exhibit downregulation by beta-agonists in culture.\r"

  ".W": "Because platelets contain active antioxidant systems, the capacity of platelets to attenuate oxidant lung injury was investigated. Purine and xanthine oxidase were infused into isolated perfused rabbit lungs (IPL) to generate H2O2, thereby causing increased membrane permeability edema. The coinfusion of washed human platelets (1.20 +/- 0.07 x 10(10) cells) attenuated the degree of edema formation as measured by lung weight gain and lung lavage albumin concentration. Electron microscopy of lung preparations demonstrated platelet adherence to capillary endothelial luminal surfaces of oxidant-injured lungs, but there was no evidence of vascular plugging with platelet macroaggregates. The platelet glutathione redox cycle or platelet catalase were inhibited before infusion of platelets into the IPL with purine and xanthine oxidase. Inhibition of the glutathione redox cycle with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, or buthionine sulfoximine prevented platelet attenuation of lung injury. Inactivation of platelet catalase with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, however, did not significantly reduce the platelet-induced lung protection. We conclude that the platelet glutathione redox cycle plays a major role in reducing enzymatically generated toxic O2 metabolites and attenuating lung injury.\r"

LICS were quite narrow between the ciliated cells compared with those around the nonciliated dark cells (goblet, brush, and basal cells). LICS comprised 6.8 +/- 2.9% of tissue volume in preparations that were mounted in an Ussing chamber and short-circuited, whereas in unmounted and open-circuited tissues it occupied only 1 +/- 0.2% of the volume of the preparations (P less than 0.016, n = 5). The effects of stimulation of Cl secretion by 1 microM epinephrine were tested. In seven epinephrine-treated tissues LICS volume was 2.9 +/- 0.9% of total epithelial volume compared with 8.7 +/- 2.9% in control tissues (P less than 0.015). The width of LICS around dark cells in epinephrine-treated tissues was 0.42 +/- 0.06 micron compared with 0.98 +/- 0.13 micron in control tissues (P less than 0.001). The data suggest that LICS act as pliable fluid reservoirs that empty and collapse on stimulation of Cl secretion.\r"

Physiol. 62: 359-363, 1987) by applying very slow sinusoidal variations of ambient pressure (delta Pam) around the body and studying the relationship between delta Pam and the resulting gas displacement at the mouth (delta Vaw): AGVapc = (PB.delta Vaw)/(delta Pam.cos phi), where AGVapc is AGV measured by ambient pressure changes, PB is barometric minus alveolar water vapor pressure, and phi is the phase angle between Pam and Vaw. The applicability of this method to excised lungs at various transpulmonary pressures was assessed in six rabbit lungs and three dog lobes by reference to AGV measurements by He dilution (AGVdil) and by a volumetric method (AGVvol). Except in one instance, AGVapc did not change significantly when the frequency of delta Pam was varied from 0.02 to 0.2 Hz. AGVapc was highly correlated (P less than 0.001) to both AGVdil and AGVvol. It did not differ significantly from AGVdil (81.4 +/- 50.6 vs. 80.2 +/- 44.2 ml) and was only marginally higher than AGVvol (64.6 +/- 26.9 vs. 62.4 +/- 24.4 ml, P less than 0.05). We conclude that the method usually provides accurate results in excised lung preparations. Its main advantages are that it does not require manipulating the lung or changing its volume and that the measurement takes less than 1 min.\r"

Intact dogs were in supine or lateral posture; partially eviscerated dogs were in lateral posture. delta Ppl,ap often differed significantly from changes in abdominal pressure (delta Pab); sometimes they differed in sign (except during phrenic stimulation). Changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure in Aap (delta Pdi,ap) could be positive or negative and were less in eviscerated than in intact dogs. delta Pdi,ap could differ in sign among respiratory maneuvers and over different parts of Aap. Hence average delta Pdi,ap should be closer to zero than delta Pdi,ap at a given site. Since delta Ppl,ap = delta Prc,ap, where Prc,ap represents rib cage pressure in Aap, delta Pdi,ap = delta Pab - delta Prc,ap. Hence, considering that delta Pab and delta Prc depend on different factors, delta Pdi,ap may differ from zero. This pressure difference seems related to the interaction between two semisolid structures (contracted diaphragm and rib cage in Aap) constrained to the same shape and position.\r"

Above functional residual capacity (FRC) changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure in area of apposition (delta Pdi,ap) were essentially nil in intact (INT) dogs either in lateral or supine posture, and in partially eviscerated (EVS) dogs in lateral posture, either in the 10th or 11th intercostal space. Below FRC delta Pdi,ap could be positive (INT lateral and EVS), nil (EVS), or negative (INT supine and EVS); it could be different in the 10th and 11th intercostal spaces. Hence, with stretched (like with contracted) diaphragm, delta Ppl,ap measured at one site often differs from delta Pab and is not representative of average pressure acting on area of apposition. With volume increase above FRC, the 11th rib moved slightly in and then out in EVS and linearly out in INT. With volume decrease below FRC it moved out progressively in EVS, and it moved in and eventually reversed in INT. In paralyzed dogs in lateral posture the factor having the greatest influence on displacement of the abdominal rib cage is Pab. Mechanical linkage with pulmonary rib cage becomes relevant at large volume, whereas insertional traction of diaphragm becomes relevant at low volume.\r"

Injection of OA (0.1 ml) into the pulmonary artery after vehicle pretreatment induced marked increases in lung weight [50.4 +/- 13.9 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.0 (SE) g 45 min after OA or vehicle, respectively, P less than 0.05], an index of pulmonary edema, and airway pressure. OA also caused a significant though minimal increase in pulmonary arterial pressure. Pretreatment with catalase (1,000 U/ml), a scavenger of H2O2, significantly (P less than 0.05, Friedman's) attenuated the increases in lung weight (50.4 +/- 13.9 vs. 15.1 +/- 4.9 g), airway pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressure. In contrast to catalase, pretreatment with Cu-tryptophan (40 microM), a lipid-soluble scavenger of superoxide, provided no protective effect by itself, nor was there any potentiation of protection when combined with catalase. Further evidence implicating O2 metabolites in OA-induced edema was obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of perfusate samples to which the spin trap, sodium 3,5-dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonate (10 mM), was added. Analysis of these samples revealed the presence of free radicals after OA. Pretreatment with catalase (1,000 U/ml) and superoxide dismutase (250 U/ml) attenuated the EPR signal, indicating that proximal formation of O2 free radicals was in part responsible for the signal. These results suggest that reactive O2 metabolites are mediators of OA-induced pulmonary edema in the isolated perfused rabbit lung.\r"

In the high TTI protocol an early increase in the tau was noted in theophylline but not in caffeine or control. In the low TTI protocol there was no difference in tau with theophylline. The combination of theophylline (100 mg/l) and verapamil (5 microM) was also studied. Verapamil decreased force in contractions of 300-ms duration but not in those lasting 160 ms and had no effect on tau. It did not block the prolongation of tau seen with theophylline. These studies suggest that theophylline has a direct effect on relaxation of skeletal muscle, which is not prevented by verapamil, and also that external calcium may be important for sustained contractions of skeletal muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The role of lactic acidosis of progressive brain hypoxia (PBH) as both a central chemoreceptor stimulant and a general respiratory depressant was assessed by preventing lactate formation both locally and globally with dichloroacetate (DCA). Phrenic nerve activity (PN) and ventral medullary pH (Vm pH) responses to PBH (1% CO-40% O2-balance N2) were determined in anesthetized, paralyzed, peripherally chemodenervated, vagotomized cats while fraction of end-tidal CO2 (FETCO2) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were maintained constant. Topical DCA near the central chemoreceptors prevented the progressive Vm acidosis of PBH and was associated with a slightly greater depression of PN for any given level of brain hypoxia [75 +/- 12% base-line mock cerebrospinal fluid compared with 63 +/- 11% base-line topical DCA at O2 content of arterial blood (CaO2) of 7.5 ml O2/dl]. Systemic DCA also prevented the progressive acidosis of PBH and significantly altered the profile of depression with PBH. Before DCA, PBH produced a progressive reduction in PN after reducing CaO2 by 20%. After DCA, PN was not significantly depressed until CaO2 was reduced to very low levels, whereupon there was a sharp decline in PN. Before DCA, reducing CaO2 to 6 ml O2/dl reduced PN by 41 +/- 16%, whereas after DCA there was no significant reduction in PN (4 +/- 5%). We conclude that 1) lactic acidosis near the central chemosensitive regions does produce a small stimulation of respiration during PBH but that 2) the overwhelming response to central lactic acidosis of PBH is respiratory depression.\r"

Phasic expiratory TA activity was present during normal tidal breathing in all subjects during wakefulness. Tonic activity was frequently present during inspiration. After an initial rapid rise in activity near the onset of expiration, phasic TA activity generally exhibited one of three different discharge patterns: a plateau, a progressive increase, or, less commonly, a progressive decrease in activity. In four of five subjects examined, peak TA activity during quiet breathing in wakefulness appeared to be directly related to time of expiration. At a particular lung volume above end-expiratory volume during wakefulness, measurements of expiratory resistance were directly related to the level of TA activity. TA activity disappeared during stable periods of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep and exhibited paroxysmal bursts of activity during rapid-eye-movement sleep. The results during wakefulness indicate that the TA contributes to an active adduction of the vocal cords in expiration and suggest the presence of an active laryngeal braking mechanism during exhalation.\r"

  ".W": "We determined how rapidly serum potassium concentration ([K+]) increased, its magnitude, and how quickly it decreased during and after a 3.5-min exercise bout at maximal speed capability in eight Hereford steers, before and after physical conditioning. Serum [K+] values rose rapidly after the start of exercise and declined rapidly to within 7% of preexercise values 5 min after exercise ceased. Before physical conditioning, serum [K+] increased from an average of 4.19 meq/l at rest to 6.71 meq/l at the highest treadmill speed the animals could sustain (1.8-2.4 m/s at a 3 degrees incline). After physical conditioning, the serum [K+] increase at comparable treadmill speeds was approximately 5% lower than before conditioning (average of 6.37 meq/l); however, the animals could now exercise from 0.6 to 0.8 m/s faster than before conditioning, and their maximal serum [K+] rose to an average of 7.47 meq/l, a 10% increase over preconditioned maximal values. We conclude that higher speeds and accompanying increases in serum [K+] attained by conditioned animals may place them at greater risk of cardiotoxicity than before conditioning.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have suggested that papaverine, a drug commonly used in studies of transvascular fluid and solute exchange to eliminate confounding effects of changes in vascular tone, may itself increase vascular permeability. In this study, we determined the ability of papaverine to alter pulmonary vascular protein permeability by measuring the osmotic reflection coefficient (sigma) for total proteins in a canine isolated perfused left lower lung lobe (LLL) preparation. The reflection coefficient, determined by the hematocrit-protein double-indicator technique, for control LLL's was 0.83 +/- 0.04 (SE) (n = 7). In separate groups of LLL's, blood papaverine HCl concentrations of 10(-5), 10(-4), and 10(-3) M resulted in sigma's of 0.84 +/- 0.02 (n = 6), 0.73 +/- 0.04 (n = 7), and 0.53 +/- 0.04 (n = 6), respectively. When two LLL's from the 10(-4) M group with sigma's of 0.56 and 0.57 were excluded from the analysis, the average sigma for this group was 0.79 +/- 0.02. We conclude that papaverine increases protein permeability at a concentration of 10(-3) M but does so in only some lobes at 10(-4) M. These results suggest that caution be taken when using high concentrations of papaverine in fluid balance studies.\r"

In these patients, a defect in tissues' ability to extract O2 from blood can leave tissue O2 needs unmet, even at a normal QO2. Endotoxin administration produces a similar state in dogs, and we used this model to study mechanisms that may contribute to human pathology. We measured systemic and hindlimb VO2 and QO2 while reducing cardiac output by blood withdrawal. At the onset of supply dependence, the systemic QO2 was 11.4 +/- 2.7 ml.kg-1.min-1 in the endotoxin group vs. 8.0 +/- 0.7 in controls (P less than 0.05). At this point, the endotoxin-treated animals extracted only 61 +/- 11% of the arterial O2, whereas control animals extracted 70 +/- 7% (P less than 0.05). Systemic VO2 rose by 15% after endotoxin (P less than 0.05) but did not change in controls. Despite this poorer systemic ability to extract O2 by the endotoxin-treated dogs, isolated hindlimb O2 extraction at the onset of supply dependence was the same in endotoxin-treated and control dogs. At normal levels of QO2, hindlimb VO2 in endotoxin-treated dogs was 23% higher than in controls (P less than 0.05). Fractional blood flow to skeletal muscle did not differ between control and endotoxin-treated dogs. Thus skeletal muscle was not overperfused in endotoxemia and did not contribute to a systemic extraction defect by stealing blood flow from other tissues. Skeletal muscle in endotoxin-treated dogs demonstrated an increase in VO2 but no defect in O2 extraction, differing in both respects from the intestine.\r"

Experiments were performed in vitro on strips of diaphragmatic muscle obtained from 21 Syrian hamsters. Muscle shortening velocity was assessed during isotonic contractions against a range of afterloads, and Hill's characteristic equation was used to calculate velocity at zero load. In addition, unloaded shortening velocity was also measured by the slack test, i.e., from the time required for muscles to take up slack after a sudden reduction in muscle length. Theophylline (160 mg/l) increased the velocity of muscle shortening against a wide range of external loads (0-14 N/cm2) and increased the extrapolated unloaded velocity of shortening from 6.4 +/- 0.9 to 7.9 +/- 1.1 (SE) lengths/s (P less than 0.01). Theophylline reduced the time required to take up slack for any given step change in muscle length, increasing the unloaded velocity of shortening assessed by the slack test from 7.6 +/- 0.9 to 9.3 +/- 1.1 lengths/s (P less than 0.002). The effect of theophylline on diaphragmatic shortening velocity was evident at concentrations as low as 40 mg/l and increased progressively as theophylline concentrations were increased to 320 mg/l. Theophylline increased the shortening velocity of fatigued as well as fresh muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

First, 34 male college students were screened on the basis of their heart rate (HR) response to a reaction time-shock avoidance (RT-AV) task. The six individuals showing an average HR increase of 45 beats/min (reactives) and the six subjects showing an average increase of 8 beats/min (nonreactives) did not differ in VO2max (47.7 +/- 2 vs. 48.7 +/- 1 ml.kg-1.min-1, respectively). However, a statistically significant association between a reported family history of hypertension and peak HR response to RT-AV was seen. In the second series of experiments, the plasma catecholamine and cardiovascular responses of eight elite endurance-trained athletes (VO2max 70.6 +/- 1 ml.kg-1.min-1) and eight untrained volunteers (VO2max 45.5 +/- 1 ml.kg-1.min-1) were compared on the following: RT-AV, reaction time for monetary reward (RT-AP), cold pressor, isometric handgrip, and orthostatic challenge (standing). The trained group exhibited a significantly lower mean HR at rest (P less than 0.05), otherwise there were no significant differences between the two groups. The results indicate that although individual differences (e.g., family history of hypertension and high resting HR) can be related to the potential for cardiovascular responses to novel laboratory challenges, the contribution of fitness to this characteristic is much less clear. Further exploration of questions pertaining to fitness and stress should focus on individuals with a predisposition to stress reactivity.\r"

However, it is not known whether the two responses reflect the effects of activation of the same contractile elements. We measured differential responses in Vti and Rcoll to histamine and leukotriene (LT) C4 to determine whether each evoked a similar pattern of response. Using the wedged bronchoscope constant-flow technique, we measured Rcoll in lobar segments of anesthetized, paralyzed, open-chest, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs. In addition, we measured (with an alveolar capsule) alveolar pressure (PA) within the segment under study. This allowed us to calculate Vti, the component of the PA change in phase with segment flow. Rcoll and Vti measurements were obtained under base-line conditions and after local delivery of aerosols generated from histamine and LTC4. In five out of five lobes studied with both histamine and LTC4, the fractional Rcoll response to histamine was greater than the fractional Rcoll response to LTC4. In contrast, in four out of five lobes examined, the fractional increase in Vti accompanying the histamine response was less than the fractional increase in Vti accompanying LTC4 administration. These data suggest that anatomically distinct contractile elements influence Vti and Rcoll insofar as LTC4 and histamine evoke quantitatively different changes in these two indexes of peripheral lung responses.\r"

Although the response functions are both infinite series, both responses are nevertheless completely defined by a single time parameter Te characteristic of the electrode under given measurement conditions. Practical verification was performed using electrodes in the double-pulsed mode, but the theory is applicable equally to direct-current-polarized and simply pulsed electrodes.\r"

Findings of age-related changes in cardiopulmonary function of this animal preparation are presented. Thirty-one lambs, 102-137 days gestation (term 147 +/- 3 days), were studied. The carotid artery, jugular vein, and trachea of the exteriorized fetus were cannulated under local anesthesia. Immediately after cesarean section delivery, ventilation commenced; warmed (39 degrees C) and oxygenated (PIO2 greater than 500 Torr) liquid fluorocarbon (RIMAR 101) was delivered to the lung by a mechanically assisted liquid ventilation system. Skeletal muscle paralysis, low-dose exogenous buffering, and thermal support were maintained during the 3-h experiment. Pulmonary gas exchange, acid-base status, and cardiopulmonary and metabolic function were assessed. By utilizing these techniques, effective arterial oxygenation, CO2 elimination, acid-base status, and cardiovascular stability were supported independent of gestational age. The results demonstrate a developmental increase in specific lung compliance and mean arterial pressure and decrease in heart rate and systemic O2 consumption per kilogram with advancing gestational age. These findings demonstrate that liquid ventilation negates the dependency of effective pulmonary gas exchange on surfactant development, thereby extending the limits of viability of the immature extrauterine lamb. As such this new experimental approach is useful for the study of physiological development over an age range previously limited to fetal animal preparations and, therefore, may provide insight regarding adaptation of the premature to the extrauterine environment.\r"

We extended that methodology and then tested the hypothesis that this technique was applicable to small mammals. TGV [at functional residual capacity (FRC)] by APC and by conventional Boyle's law was compared in 12 rabbits. The rabbits were anesthetized, tracheostomized, intubated, and placed in a pressure plethysmograph. Although in the method of Peslin et al. box pressure was oscillated at a single frequency, in our extension box pressure was oscillated simultaneously at two frequencies (0.1 and 0.2 Hz). Flow at the airway opening consisted of rapid events due to spontaneous breathing, superposed on slower events due to the alveolar gas compression. The slower events were analyzed to yield alveolar gas compliance and, by Boyle's law, FRC. FRC by APC was highly correlated to FRC by conventional plethysmography (r = 0.85). Compared with the methodology of Peslin et al., our extension relaxes a key limitation and yields systematically higher estimates of FRC. We conclude that this method is applicable to small mammals, despite an inherently more compliant chest wall, and that the methodological extension improves the estimate of FRC.\r"

Multipoint P/Q plots were constructed in conscious dogs during normoxia and during bilateral alveolar hypoxia by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to reduce Q. With the ANS intact, the pulmonary vascular pressure gradient (pulmonary arterial pressure-pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) increased (P less than 0.01) approximately twofold during hypoxia over a broad range of Q. The absolute magnitude of the HPV response was related (P less than 0.01) to the level of Q. We hypothesized that if ANS activation reduces the magnitude of HPV in intact dogs, then we would expect the magnitude of HPV to be increased both after combined sympathetic alpha-(phentolamine) and beta-(propranolol) adrenergic block and after total autonomic ganglionic block (hexamethonium). A marked HPV response (P less than 0.01) was observed after both combined sympathetic block and ganglionic block over a broad range of Q during alveolar hypoxia. The magnitude of the HPV response with the ANS intact, however, was not significantly different from the magnitude of HPV after combined sympathetic block (P = 0.45) or after ganglionic block (P = 0.64) at any level of Q. Thus, during bilateral alveolar hypoxia, the ANS does not appear to attenuate the HPV response of intact conscious dogs.\r"

The two procedures were designed to give the same total contraction time of 51 s and used the same number of stimulation pulses. Muscle biopsies were taken at rest and after 22 and 51 s of work and analyzed for ATP, phosphocreatine, and glucolytic intermediates. The results were compared with previous studies on continuous and intermittent stimulation. Fatigue developed significantly faster with contractions of short duration, and the energy cost was higher. Since force at the end of stimulation had a negative correlation to ATP utilization, there is no indication that the energy resources limit force generation. By comparison of stimulations producing the same amount of isometric work but with a different number of contractions, we estimate that the energy cost for activation and relaxation of a 1-s contraction is approximately 37% of the total ATP consumption.\r"

Studies were performed on 12 anesthetized mechanically ventilated dogs in which strips of left costal diaphragm were developed in situ. Strip blood flow was assessed with a drop counter attached to a catheter tied into the phrenic veins' draining strips. Strip tension was measured with an isometric force transducer. Amrinone was administered as an intravenous bolus of 2 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 25 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Amrinone increased cardiac output and resting diaphragm blood flow [from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.2 +/- 3 (SE) l/min and from 13 +/- 2 to 29 +/- 6 (SE) ml.100 g-1.min-1, respectively, P less than 0.001 for both comparisons]. Amrinone also increased blood flow during periods of rhythmic contraction (tension time indexes of 0.1-0.4, P less than 0.05 for comparisons of flow with and without amrinone at each tension time index) and increased the magnitude of the postcontraction hyperemia (P less than 0.02 for comparisons of hyperemic flow with and without amrinone at tension time indexes of 0.3 and 0.4). Graded occlusion of the inferior vena cava produced reductions in arterial pressure, cardiac output, and diaphragm blood flow both before and after amrinone. Both cardiac output and diaphragm blood flow were greater after amrinone, however, at all levels of blood pressure examined. These findings indicate that amrinone can override diaphragm vasoregulatory systems and augment diaphragm blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intercostal muscle perfusion at rest was significantly less than in either phrenic region. Graded exercise resulted in significant progressive increments in perfusion to these tissues.

Deep body temperature was recorded at three sites: esophagus, auditory canal, and rectum. During spontaneous and inhalation rewarming, there were no significant differences between the cooling (final 30 min) and afterdrop (initial 10 min) rates as calculated for each deep body temperature site, thus supporting the hypothesis. During rapid rewarming, the afterdrop rate was significantly greater than during the preceding cooling, suggesting a convective component contributing to the increased rate of fall. The rapid reversal of the afterdrop also indicates that a convective component contributes to the rewarming process as well.\r"

Additionally, increments of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 kg of tension produced by passive stretch elicited pressor responses of -6 +/- 1, 7 +/- 1, 16 +/- 3, 21 +/- 8, 28 +/- 6, and 54 +/- 9 mmHg, respectively. External pressure, applied with a cuff to the triceps surae to produce intramuscular pressures (125-300 mmHg) that were similar to those seen during static contraction, also elicited small increases in MAP (4 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 1 mmHg) but did not alter HR. Transection of dorsal roots L5-L7 and S1 abolished the responses to passive stretch and external pressure. Moreover, when the triceps surae were stretched passively to produce a pattern and amount of tension similar to that seen during static hindlimb contraction, a significant reflex cardiovascular response occurred. During this maneuver, the pressor response averaged 51% of that seen during contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Efferent postganglionic MSA was recorded directly with a tungsten microelectrode inserted percutaneously into the tibial nerve. Heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) were counted respectively from the R wave of an electrocardiogram and from the respiratory tracing recorded by the strain-gauge method. The average values of the MSA burst rate and total activity of MSA (burst rate x mean burst amplitude) at 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 m were 36.4 +/- 2.6, 39.1 +/- 3.1, and 40.2 +/- 4.2 (SE) bursts/min and 616 +/- 138, 794 +/- 190, and 764 +/- 227 arbitrary units, respectively. These values were significantly higher than the values of 27.1 +/- 2.9 bursts/min and 446 +/- 28 at sea level. HR increased significantly at altitudes, but RR did not show significant change. Under severe hypoxic conditions beyond 5,000 m, there were large interindividual differences in the MSA responsiveness to hypoxia. The results indicate that MSA is activated under hypoxia by stimulating the chemoreceptors. However, the central controlling mechanisms that would be affected by hypoxia may also influence the MSA responsiveness under severe hypoxia.\r"

Plasma insulin levels were similar in both trials. Muscle glycogen levels were also similar in CHO and CON both before and after exercise; accordingly, there was no difference between trials in the amount of glycogen used during the 2 h of exercise (CHO = 62.8 +/- 10.1 mmol/kg wet wt, CON = 56.9 +/- 10.1).

The arterial hemodynamic response after the initial cardiovascular adjustments to the tilt consisted of no change in heart rate and significantly increased arterial blood pressure, with significantly reduced stroke volume and cardiac output. Both renal blood flow and terminal aorta blood flow declined significantly, even more than cardiac output. Muscular exertion was not part of the tilt response because upright standing on the hindlimbs elicited a sustained increase in heart rate and a significantly smaller increase in estimated total peripheral resistance.

Spinal cord stimulation sites were located by inserting monopolar or bipolar stimulating electrodes either at the dorsolateral sulcus or at least 1 mm medial or lateral to the sulcus. With stimulation at each site, alterations in respiratory rhythm, orthodromic phrenic nerve responses, and antidromic activation of medullary respiratory-modulated neurons were examined. Phrenic nerve responses to cervical spinal cord stimulation consisted of an early excitation (2-4 ms) and/or a late excitation (4-8 ms). Stimulation of the lateral region evoked the greatest amplitude early response and stimulation of the ventrolateral region produced the greatest late excitation. All three stimulus sites elicited antidromic activation of some respiratory-modulated neurons in the dorsal (DRG) and ventral respiratory groups (VRG). The lateral region was the least effective resetting site, and it had the highest incidence of antidromic activation of both DRG and VRG neurons. The ventrolateral region of the cervical spinal cord was the most effective resetting site, but it had the lowest incidence of antidromic activation of DRG respiratory-modulated neurons. In addition, resetting responses were observed with spinal cord stimulation at similar sites in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord regions thought to be devoid of inspiratory bulbospinal axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We believe that structural changes during respiratory movements may include changes in the length and diameter of the whole duct. Alveoli are seen to be side differentiations secondary to the ducts in the gas-exchanging parenchyma of the rabbit lung. We have developed a technique for measuring local curvature in simple reconstructed ducts from the average of the integral curvation of the section contour. The contour curvature is measured from the chain code representation of the sampled contour from digital image analysis. The stereological requirements of an unbiased and random selection of contours is approached here by the random orientation of the individual alveoli of a single duct. Over 700 sections through the last four airway generations (alveolar ducts) at 3-micron intervals were analyzed. The average integral curvature ranges from 7.7 to 9.5 (mean 8.9) mm-1 for sixth- and seventh-generation branches from the start with volumes for the segments from 0.022 to 1.198 (mean 0.497) mm3.\r"

This relationship makes possible the correction of washin or washout data for blood uptake or release, provided that two gases of different solubility are used simultaneously. The method automatically allows for the characteristics of an individual washin or washout and for the occurrence of recirculation within a fairly short washin or washout period. It has been tested in models with nonuniform ventilation and perfusion and closely approximates the behavior of a truly insoluble gas. In the derived ventilation distribution, gas solubility appears as ventilation to units of low turnover. In the case of N2 this effect is small but causes appreciable overestimation of lung volume. The recovered dead space and main alveolar distribution are insignificantly affected.\r"

Regional foot-to-foot pulse wave velocities and pressure waveforms along the aorta were used to define an \"apparent anatomic length\" or distance to a dominant discrete site of reflection \"seen\" by the ejecting ventricle. Time of wave travel was taken to be one-half the interval from the foot of the incident wave to the midsystolic inflection point. Knowing the time of travel from the returning reflection and velocity, distances calculated to the \"apparent anatomic length\" were 35 +/- 2 and 34 +/- 2 during control and Mueller maneuver, respectively (P = NS). The frequency of the first minimum of the modulus (fmin) and the first zero crossing of the phase angle (f phi) were determined from the input impedance spectra. During baseline conditions, fmin (3.9 +/- 0.2 Hz) approximately equaled f phi (4.2 +/- 0.2 Hz), and the resulting \"effective lengths\" calculated using the quarter-wavelength formula were similar to the apparent anatomic length. These data suggested that the aortic region incorporating the renal arterial branches as a site of discrete reflection and that terminal load was not significantly frequency dependent. During Mueller maneuver, however, f min (3.3 +/- 0.2 Hz) and f phi (5.1 +/- 0.2 Hz) were significantly discordant, the terminal load became strongly frequency dependent, and effective length calculated from f min was dissimilar (P less than 0.05) from the unchanged apparent anatomic length.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined the effects of concentrations of alcohol comparable to blood levels achieved from social drinking on ciliary beat frequency. We obtained ciliated cells by brushing the trachea of unanesthetized sheep during fiber-optic bronchoscopy. The cells were suspended in a perfusion chamber and physiological conditions were maintained in vitro. Ciliary beat frequency and synchrony were determined by slow-motion analysis of video images obtained by interference contrast microscopy. Metachronal ciliary coordination was observed in all preparations. The ciliary beat frequency was stimulated at ethanol concentrations from 0.01 up to but not including 0.1%, unchanged at 0.5 and 1%, and slowed at 2%. While confirming inhibition of ciliary motility at very high ethanol levels, we observed no acute impairment of ciliary function at ethanol concentrations comparable to those achieved from social drinking. Indeed, we found an unexpected stimulation of ciliary beating at low levels of ethanol. How this alteration in ciliary beating would affect pulmonary clearance remains unknown at this time.\r"

Tidal volume (VT) and minute ventilation (VE) were recorded from a Respitrace and diaphragmatic electromyogram (DEMG) from a bipolar esophageal electrode. During short, 5-min runs of \"low\" and \"high\" NPV, VT did not change and VE increased in a borderline significant way at -30-cmH2O NPV. Peak integrated DEMG amplitude did not change with respect to control during short runs of NPV. However, when NPV was maintained for 20-60 min, a significant (though small, 20%) decrease in peak DEMG amplitude was observed with respect to control. By contrast, in a ninth patient habituated to NPV, the decrease in peak DEMG amplitude during a 5-min run of NPV was 60%. Significant increases in arterial PO2 (at -10- and -30-cmH2O NPV) and decreases in arterial PCO2 (at -30-cmH2O NPV) were found during NPV for the whole group of patients. One-to-one phase locking between the respirator and patients was the most common pattern of entrainment observed. However, 1:1 phase locking did not preclude the presence of dissociation between the two pacemakers. We conclude that short runs of NPV in naive patients do not result in changes in DEMG, as opposed to immediate and nearly complete cessation of inspiratory activity in trained patients.\r"

The bronchial artery, a branch of the bronchoesophageal artery, was cannulated and perfused with a pump with blood from a femoral artery. Bronchial blood flow was set so bronchial arterial pressure approximated systemic arterial pressure. For the group of 25 sheep, control bronchial blood flow was 22 ml/min or 0.7 ml.min-1.kg-1. During the hypoxic exposure, animals were ventilated with a mixture of N2 and air to achieve an arterial PO2 (PaO2) of 30 or 45 Torr. For the more severe hypoxic challenge, bronchial vascular resistance (BVR), as determined by the slope of the linearized pressure-flow curve, decreased acutely from 3.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.ml-1.min to 2.9 +/- 0.3 mmHg.ml-1.min after 5 min of hypoxia. However, this vasodilation was not sustained, and BVR measured at 30 min of hypoxia was 4.2 +/- 0.8 mmHg.ml-1.min. The zero flow intercept, an index of downstream pressure, remained unaltered during the hypoxic exposure. Under conditions of moderate hypoxia (PaO2 = 45 Torr), BVR decreased from 4.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.ml-1.min at 5 min and remained dilated at 30 min (3.6 +/- 0.5 mmHg.ml-1.min). To determine whether dilator prostaglandins were responsible for the initial bronchial vascular dilation under conditions of severe hypoxia (PaO2 approximately equal to 30 Torr), we studied an additional group of animals with pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin (2 mg/kg) and ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Blood viscosity was changed by erythrocyte (RBC) shrinkage and swelling with hypertonic and hypotonic NaCl solutions and by RBC membrane rigidification with heat treatment (49 degrees C for 1 h). The results show that although all three methods of changing blood viscosity increased the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 15-50%, the site and nature of the change in PVR were different in each case. The AVO data showed that the increase in PVR with heat treatment of RBC's was due entirely (100%) to increased resistance of the middle microvascular segment, whereas deviation from normal osmolarity potentiated the resistance in arterial, middle, and venous segments. By examining the effect of osmolarity in plasma-perfused lobes, it was possible to separate the increase in PVR due to changes in RBC deformability from those due to other factors. The increase in arterial and venous resistances with hypertonic solution was attributed in part (approximately 50%) to factors other than RBC's; however, the increase in middle resistance was entirely due to RBC crenation. The increase in arterial and venous resistances with hypotonic solutions was small and was apparently caused by factors other than RBC swelling, whereas the increase in middle resistance was partially (approximately 50%) due to RBC swelling and partially to other factors (e.g., endothelial cell hydration).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In decerebrate, paralyzed, vagotomized cats with bilateral pneumothoraxes, we recorded phrenic and abdominal (cranial iliohypogastric nerve, L1) nerve activities at hyperoxic normocapnia. We reduced the duration and intensity (i.e., integrated peak height) of phrenic nerve discharge for single cycles by stimulating the cut central end of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) during the central inspiratory phase (75 microA, 20-50 Hz, 0.2-ms pulse). Premature termination of inspiration consistently reduced expiratory duration (TE) and abdominal expiratory nerve activity (area of integrated neurogram), but the average reduction in TE was much less than the reduction in abdominal nerve activity (14 vs. 51%). Stimulation of the cut central end of the vagus nerve yielded similar results, as did spontaneous premature terminations of inspiration, which we observed in one cat. SLN stimulation during hyperoxic hypercapnia resulted in more variable responses, and higher stimulation frequencies were usually required to abort inspiration. SLN (or vagal) stimulation during expiration consistently increased abdominal expiratory nerve activity. We speculate that this facilitatory response is gated during inspiration, thereby allowing the inspiratory conditioning effect on the subsequent expiration to be expressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The ability of the experimental preparation to measure the results of acute changes in right heart volume or output and acute changes in LV afterload was validated in open-chest studies with and without pericardial constraint. In closed-chest studies, with a fall in Pp1 during a Mueller maneuver Qm reached both its inspiratory minimum and expiratory maximum before Qa in 80% of the Mueller maneuvers, invalidating both hypotheses, which each required that one flow lead the other in 100% of the Mueller maneuvers. Review of individual records suggested that if the rapid changes in Pp1 occurred during systole, Qa could vary in a manner independent of the preceding Qm. These studies suggest that both diastolic and systolic events may contribute to the fall in SV, while causing opposite changes in LV volumes.\r"

During inspiration in the absence of the larynx, mixing increased as airflow increased, reaching a peak value at 0.2 l/s, and decreasing as airflow increased further. This mixing peak was higher in the branched region than in the tracheal region and was inversely related to the diffusion coefficient of the indicator gas-air mixture. During inspiration in the presence of the larynx, a mixing peak was observed in the tracheal region, but mixing peaks in the branched region were eliminated by turbulence propagated downstream from the larynx. During expiration, laryngeal turbulence was propagated far enough downstream (i.e., proximal to the trachea) that mixing peaks could be observed in both tracheal and branched regions whether or not the larynx cast was present.\r"

The postinflation phospholipid yield was also significantly reduced with colchicine from 1.04 to 0.70 mg/g dry lung wt (P less than 0.05). The postinflation DNA was significantly reduced with colchicine, from 1.26 to 0.44 micrograms (P less than 0.01), suggesting reduced alveolar macrophages. Colchicine did not change the recovery by lavage of exogenous radioactive phospholipid. As reflected by ATP and lactate levels, tissue metabolism was well maintained. The results are interpreted to mean that colchicine reduced simultaneously lavage-associated phospholipid secretion, inflation-produced phospholipid secretion, and macrophage migration.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the mechanisms of platelet uptake in the lungs after alpha-thrombin-induced pulmonary microembolism. Platelets labeled with 111In-oxine were reinfused into chronically prepared sheep. Pulmonary microembolism resulted in an increase in lung platelet radioactivity (95.5 +/- 15.3%; n = 4), which was followed by an exponential washout (half-life = 115 +/- 4 min). Platelet uptake in the lungs was more sustained after prior fibrinolytic inhibition with tranexamic acid (half-life = 178 +/- 11 min), although the initial increase was similar (90.7 +/- 9.6%; n = 7). Prior depletion of fibrinogen with ancrod (Arvin), blunted the initial increase in lung platelet uptake after alpha-thrombin challenge (31.7 +/- 11.3%, n = 5), indicating that the effect of thrombin was markedly dependent on fibrinogen. We examined the role of circulating granulocytes, since platelets may bind to subendothelial matrix exposed after granulocyte-mediated lung vascular injury. Maximal pulmonary platelet uptake after thrombin in granulocytopenic sheep was not different from control (71.7 +/- 14.4%; n = 4). The results indicate that pulmonary microembolism results in lung platelet sequestration. Platelet uptake is not dependent on granulocyte-mediated vascular injury but requires fibrin deposition and is sustained if fibrinolysis is inhibited.\r"

  ".U": "89033566\r", 
  ".W": "Diaphragmatic O2 and lactate extraction were examined in seven healthy ponies during maximal exercise (ME) carried out without, as well as with, inspiratory resistive breathing. Arterial and diaphragmatic venous blood were sampled simultaneously at rest and at 30-s intervals during the 4 min of ME. Experiments were carried out before and after left laryngeal hemiplegia (LH) was produced. During ME, normal ponies exhibited hypocapnia, hemoconcentration, and a decrease in arterial PO2 (PaO2) with insignificant change in O2 saturation. In LH ponies, PaO2 and O2 saturation decreased well below that in normal ponies, but because of higher hemoglobin concentration, arterial O2 content exceeded that in normal ponies. Because of their high PaCO2 during ME, acidosis was more pronounced in LH animals despite similar lactate values. Diaphragmatic venous PO2 and O2 saturation decreased with ME to 15.5 +/- 0.9 Torr and 18 +/- 0.5%, respectively, at 120 s of exercise in normal ponies. In LH ponies, corresponding values were significantly less: 12.4 +/- 1.3 Torr and 15.5 +/- 0.7% at 120 s and 9.8 +/- 1.4 Torr and 14.3 +/- 0.6% at 240 s of ME. Mean phrenic O2 extraction plateaued at 81 and 83% in normal and LH animals, respectively. Significant differences in lactate concentration between arterial and phrenic-venous blood were not observed during ME. It is concluded that PO2 and O2 saturation in the phrenic-venous blood of normal ponies do not reach their lowest possible values even during ME. Also, the healthy equine diaphragm, even with the added stress of inspiratory resistive breathing, did not engage in net lactate production.\r"

  ".W": "The aspiration of gastric acid causes pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. One approach to the management of this syndrome is to raise cardiac output (Qt) and O2 delivery (QO2) to ensure tissue oxygenation (VO2) at the risk of increasing the edema. Another approach reduces the edema by reducing pulmonary microvascular pressure (Pmv) at the risk of reducing QO2 and VO2. We compared these approaches in 24 anesthetized, ventilated dogs with pulmonary wedge pressure (Ppw), a clinical approximation of Pmv, of 12.5 mmHg. Before and again 1 h after endobronchial instillation of 0.1 N HCl, we measured Qt, QO2, VO2, venous admixture, and in vivo extravascular lung liquid. The dogs were then randomly divided into four equal groups: 1) 12.5 mmHg Ppw, high Qt; 2) 7.5 mmHg Ppw, intermediate Qt; 3) 4.5 mmHg Ppw, low Qt; and 4) 4.5 mmHg Ppw plus dopamine, intermediate Qt. Measured values were followed for 4 more h, after which the lungs were excised to compare wet weight-to-body weight ratios (W/B). When plasmapheresis reduced Ppw at 1 h, edema did not increase further and W/B of groups 2 (21 +/- 3), 3 (18 +/- 3), and 4 (22 +/- 3) were significantly less than in group 1 (27 +/- 3) (P less than 0.001). Although Qt decreased with Ppw, increased hematocrit and reduced venous admixture maintained QO2 in group 2 but not in group 3. In group 4 an intermediate Qt maintained QO2 even at 4.5 mmHg Ppw but edema increased to the group 2 level presumably because Pmv rose with Qt on dopamine. VO2 remained constant over time in each group. These data demonstrate that canine HCl-induced pulmonary edema, measured in vivo or gravimetrically, is very sensitive to reductions in Pmv. Moreover, the lowest Pmv (and QO2) was well tolerated because an O2 supply dependency of VO2 was not observed.\r"

  ".W": "Thermal injury results in dystropic changes in skeletal muscle and abnormal pharmacological responses to neuromuscular relaxants, each of which suggests a denervation-like phenomenon. In the rat thermal injury model we examined whether, as in denervation states, increases in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and hyposensitivity to d-tubocurarine (dTc) are found. While anesthetized, thermal injury was imposed to trunk only. At 10, 14, and 21 days after injury the effective doses of dTc for left gastrocnemius tension suppression to 95% of control tension (ED95) were 0.213 +/- 0.039, 0.305 +/- 0.070, and 0.214 +/- 0.032 mg/kg, respectively. These values were significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than control values (0.155 +/- 0.006 mg/kg). The AChR concentrations in the left gastrocnemius, quantitated by 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding, increased at 10, 14, and 21 days to 182 +/- 20% (P less than 0.001), 166 +/- 22% (P less than 0.03), and 164 +/- 18% (P less than 0.001) of control, respectively. AChR concentrations in the right gastrocnemius also increased subsequent to thermal injury. Changes in effective dose of dTc for 50 and 95% twitch suppression in the left gastrocnemius correlated significantly with changes in AChR concentrations for the same muscle (r = 0.73 and 0.81, P less than 0.001, respectively). This study confirms the hypothesis that the systemic effects of thermal injury include an increase in AChR at sites distant from thermal injury, which may account for the skeletal muscle dysfunction and aberrant responses to neuromuscular relaxants.\r"

  ".W": "Responses of 21 women and 29 men (29-56 yr of age) to -50 Torr lower body negative pressure (LBNP) were examined for differences due to sex or age. Responses to LBNP were normal, including fluid shift from thorax to lower body, increased heart rate and peripheral resistance, and decreased stroke volume, cardiac output, and Heather index of ventricular function. Mean arterial blood pressure did not change. Comparison of responses of the women to responses of an age-matched subset of the men (n = 26) indicated the men had larger relative increases in calf circumference and greater increases in peripheral resistance during LBNP than the women, whereas the women experienced greater increases in thoracic impedance and heart rate. Analyses of responses of the 29 men for age-related differences indicated older subjects had greater increases in peripheral resistance and less heart rate elevation in response to LBNP (P less than 0.05 for all differences, except sex-related heart rate difference, where P less than 0.10). Based on these data and the data of other investigators, we hypothesize the age-related circulatory differences in response to LBNP are due to a reduction in vagal response and a switch to predominant sympathetic nervous system influence in older men. We cannot exclude the possibility that diminished responsiveness in the afferent arm of the baroreceptor reflex also plays a role in the attenuated heart rate response of older men to LBNP.\r"
