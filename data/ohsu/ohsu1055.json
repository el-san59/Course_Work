  ".W": "A previous report indicated that recreational runners had increased meniscal signal intensity and visible joint effusions on magnetic resonance (MR) images after jogging. Therefore, the knees of trained long-distance runners were evaluated by means of MR imaging before and after competition to determine the presence of any structural alterations, particularly changes in intrameniscal signal intensity and/or joint effusions. T1-weighted coronal, proton-density and T2-weighted sagittal, and short T1 inversion recovery sagittal images were obtained in five trained runners 24 hours before and within 24 hours after completion of a long-distance race (distance range, 17-50 miles). Pre- and postrace images were filmed and windowed with standardized techniques. All ligaments were normal before and after the race. No alteration in meniscal signal intensity was noted for any menisci, and there was no increase in joint fluid after running. These data indicate that the knees of trained long-distance runners do not demonstrate changes similar to those found in recreational runners, suggesting that these athletes may have adapted to the stresses of their activity.\r"

Images were obtained with a 1.5-T imager, and signal intensity was measured in the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the graft. In 15 unimpinged ACL grafts, the signal intensity remained low and did not vary during the 1st year of graft implantation (45 images). In contrast, 17 impinged ACL grafts showed an increase in signal intensity in the distal two-thirds of the graft that persisted 1-3 years after implantation (P less than .001). Unimpinged grafts were placed in tibial tunnels posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof. Reconstructions with anterior tibial tunnels resulted in graft impingement that caused increases in graft signal intensity. This increase demonstrates a clear association between surgical technique and the subsequent MR appearance of the graft.\r"

Associated abnormalities of the biceps tendon include thickening (n = 3), high signal intensity (n = 3), and surrounding fluid (n = 4). The factors thought to contribute to dislocation can also be well seen on MR images. These include abnormal shape of the bicipital groove (n = 2), disruption of the coracohumeral ligament (n = 6), disruption (n = 4) and thinning (n = 1) of the subscapularis tendon, and supraspinatus tendon tear (n = 4).

Bacterial myositis was diagnosed in six patients: in five it was caused by pyogenic bacteria, and in the other, by Mycobacterium tuberculosis; in each patient, little or no subcutaneous tissue alteration occurred. On T1-weighted images in three patients, muscle abscesses showed a rim of increased signal intensity corresponding to margins between drainable pus and edematous muscle.

Symptoms were assessed, and T2-weighted images of the arms were obtained before exercise and 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 40, 50, 60, and 80 days after exercise. Statistically significant increases in T2 relaxation times indicative of muscle injury occurred on each day of MR imaging evaluation in muscles performing eccentric actions, peaking on day 3 in two subjects; day 5, two subjects; and day 10, one subject. The pattern and extent of the abnormalities on MR images were variable. Pain, soreness, and joint stiffness were present on days 1, 3, and 5 in muscles that performed eccentric actions. MR imaging showed subclinical abnormalities that lasted as long as 75 days after the disappearance of symptoms (two subjects). Muscles that performed concentric actions had no changes in T2 relaxation times and were asymptomatic throughout the study.\r"

Maximum thickness of the plantar fascia was significantly increased (P less than .0001) in patients with plantar fasciitis (sagittal, 7.40 mm +/- 1.17, and coronal, 7.56 mm +/- 1.01) compared with age- and sex-matched volunteers (sagittal, 3.22 mm +/- 0.44, and coronal, 3.44 mm +/- 0.53) and young male controls (sagittal, 3.00 mm +/- 0.8, and coronal, 3.00 mm +/- 0.0). Furthermore, nine of 10 feet with plantar fasciitis had areas of moderately increased signal intensity in the substance of the fascia. MR imaging may provide an objective assessment of the morphologic changes associated with plantar fasciitis, as well as assist in excluding other causes of heel pain.\r"

Simulated loads were applied to the vertebral models to estimate vertebral strength. Yield strength in the models from patients with osteoporosis was 0.22-1.05 MPa (average, 0.57 MPa +/- 0.26 [mean +/- standard deviation]), compared with 0.80-2.79 MPa (1.46 +/- 0.52, P less than .001) in patients with normal bone. Yield strength of vertebrae in patients with osteoporosis uniformly fell below approximately 1.0 MPa, with minimal overlap between patients with osteoporosis and those with normal bone compared with the overlap in bone mineral content and trabecular mineral density. Reproducibility of the FEA technique was 12.1% in a subgroup of patients with normal bone. A constant relationship between cortical and trabecular contributions was observed in patients with osteoporosis but not in control patients.\r"

All lesions with irregular borders were malignant. Seventy percent of metastatic lesions, 85% of cavernous hemangiomas, and 100% of simple hepatic cysts were of homogeneous signal intensity, while 60% of hepatocellular carcinomas were inhomogeneous. Logistic regression analysis of multiple lesion characteristics showed that inhomogeneous lesions had a high likelihood of malignancy, while markedly hyperintense lesions had a very low probability of being malignant, regardless of other traits. Homogeneous lesions that were isointense or hyperintense compared with spleen on balanced images but were not markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted images also had a high likelihood of malignancy.\r"

A heterogeneous signal intensity pattern was observed in 11 patients with splenic lesions during bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with conversion to homogeneous enhancement 1 minute later. Mean splenic enhancement was 321% during bolus injection, with a rapid return toward baseline signal intensity thereafter. In the second phase, evaluation of 18 splenic lesions detected with contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 11 patients revealed that dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR pulse sequences significantly improved lesion conspicuity and detectability compared with conventional T1-and T2-weighted pulse sequences.

Images were always acquired during the first passage of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the liver parenchyma. An increase in liver-to-lesion contrast was obtained with MRAP imaging (contrast-to-noise ratio = 8 +/- 1.8 vs 19 +/- 2.7). Signal intensity enhancement of the liver was high (signal-to-noise ratio = 9.48 +/- 2.42), while the lesion presented no significant enhancement (signal-to-noise ratio = 0.55 +/- 0.22). Lobar portal vein thrombosis was detected in one patient owing to lack of enhancement of the left lobe of the liver. No side effects related to administration of iodinated and paramagnetic contrast agents were observed. This new technique provides specific enhancement of liver parenchyma with improved liver-to-lesion contrast.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance images of the pituitary glands in 48 endocrinologically normal neonates and infants were analyzed to determine the changes in pituitary gland size, shape, and signal intensity that occur during the 1st year of life. A progressive increase in the length--but not height--of the gland was seen throughout the 1st year. When corrections for total brain size were made, the pituitary gland was found to diminish in relative cross-sectional area throughout infancy. Upward convexity of the gland was seen in 63% of neonates less than 1 month of age, but in only 4% of infants older than 2 months. Hyperintensity of the adenohypophysis relative to the brain stem was visualized on T1-weighted images in 18 of the 24 (75%) neonates and infants less than 2 months old; this appearance was never seen in older infants. An area of high signal intensity was visualized in the posterior pituitary in 32 of 48 cases (67%), and its visualization was unrelated to age. The neonatal and young infant pituitary gland is thus significantly rounder, brighter, and relatively larger during the first 2 months of life than in later infancy.\r"

  ".W": "A subperiosteal abscess is an uncommon complication of osteomyelitis in childhood. Bone scanning is very sensitive for the detection of early skeletal infection; however, a subperiosteal abscess has a different and distinctive scintigraphic appearance. The usual increased tracer uptake of osteomyelitis is overshadowed by the presence of a \"cold\" lesion on the delayed views, probably due to interruption of the vascular supply of the bone. Early recognition of the condition is important, as surgery is indicated to prevent extensive bone necrosis and chronic osteomyelitis. In suspected osteomyelitis, a central photopenic area is highly suggestive of subperiosteal abscess; when such an area is seen, a computed tomographic (CT) scan can be helpful in planning the surgical approach for drainage. Plain radiographs may be unremarkable even when the bone scan and CT findings are dramatic. Five such cases are presented, and a recommended diagnostic approach is discussed that views the two procedures as complementary.\r"

Results of multiple regression analyses showed that Tanner stage and weight were the best predictive indicators of bone mass and bone mineral density. The influences of age, sex, race, physical activity, and diet were not significant when Tanner stage and weight were controlled. Two tables of predictive intervals for lumbar vertebral bone mineral density in healthy children (one based on Tanner stage and weight; the other, on age and weight) are presented. With normative data now available for use with this precise technique, clinicians can better detect abnormal bone mineral density in children and evaluate changes in mineralization over time.\r"

Of eight patients with complete inversion of the SMA and SMV, one had normal midgut rotation, two had malrotation, and six had neoplasms that displaced the vessels (one of these six also had malrotation). Of eight patients with inversion of only a part of the mesenteric vessels, none had malrotation. Although mesenteric inversion should stimulate a careful evaluation for malrotation, it is not pathognomonic of this condition.\r"

In addition, the intact skin surface overlying the distal spine, not seen at transabdominal US, was well demonstrated at TPU in 18 of these fetuses. TPU was used to improve assessment of intracranial anatomy in six cases with a cephalic presentation in which the fetal head was located low in the maternal pelvis and could not be adequately visualized with the transabdominal technique. In one of these cases, TPU offered improved visualization of anencephaly. Use of TPU should be considered to optimize visualization of the presenting fetal part when results at transabdominal US are suboptimal and the poorly seen part overlies the maternal cervix.\r"

The radiologists were also asked to estimate the relative intraservice work values of 12 of the radiologic services in the original RBRVS study, using the same definitions and the same standard service. The radiologists were found to be relatively well informed and accurate regarding the RBRVS-based Medicare reform. However, the standard errors of estimated work in the sample were much greater (from 56% to over 800%) than those reported for the nationally based RBRVS. The AC and CH radiologists also appeared to differ qualitatively in their perceptions of intraservice work. These findings suggest that the RBRVS may not represent accurately the spread of perceived relative work values among radiologists, including differences between AC and CH components in terms of site-specific radiologic work.\r"

A direct mammographic-histologic correlation was found in 24 of the 58 cases (41%), near correlation in 15 (26%), and remote correlation in 19 (33%). Clustered microcalcifications were the most common mammographic abnormality that was directly correlated with AH at histologic examination. Atypical ductal hyperplasia was much more frequently associated with a direct mammographic-histologic correlation than was atypical lobular hyperplasia (48% vs 9%). The authors conclude that, although no pathognomonic appearance of AH was discovered, mammographic abnormalities similar to those of small cancers could be directly correlated with histologic findings in 41% of cases. Since AH has been shown to be associated with a five- to tenfold increased risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma, frequent clinical and at least yearly mammographic follow-up is suggested once AH is discovered.\r"

Scan findings were correlated with other imaging data and physical examination and biopsy results. Ten of 10 primary breast cancers were imaged by means of FDG PET with a tumor:background FDG uptake ratio of 8.1 (median). Ten of 10 bone metastases were imaged with a tumor:normal bone uptake ratio of 6.05 (median). Five of five known soft-tissue metastases and four previously unsuspected nodal lesions were found with PET. No false-positive foci of FDG uptake were demonstrated. In two cases with negative mammograms due to dense breast parenchyma, FDG PET clearly delineated the primary tumors. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and substantial potential of PET scanning with FDG to detect and localize both primary and metastatic breast cancers.\r"

After overnight clamping, the catheter was opened and the empyema drained with use of negative suction (20 cm H2O). Intermittent irrigation of the catheter with normal saline was performed to prevent clogging of the catheter. Complete drainage of multiloculated empyemas was accomplished in nine patients by means of intracavitary instillation of urokinase via a single 8-F catheter. One patient showed complete drainage of multiloculated empyema, but recurrent empyema appeared in the site of a previous tube thoracostomy. A total of 100,000-700,000 IU (mean, 400,000 IU) of urokinase were needed for complete drainage in all patients.

Echo times as short as 50 microseconds can be achieved, producing a proton-density-weighted image. An excised inflated lung specimen and specimens from human subjects with normal lungs (n = 3), pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (n = 1), bronchogenic carcinoma (n = 1), and bullous lung disease with lung metastases (n = 1) were examined.

Although computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be helpful in the evaluation of lung disease in CF, no scoring system or other objective criteria have been developed for the evaluation of the wide range of pulmonary changes in these patients. A CT scoring system was devised that incorporates all of the changes seen in the lungs of patients with CF. Such a scoring system may facilitate objective evaluation of existing and newly developed therapeutic regimens and may be a valuable tool in the preoperative evaluation of patients being considered for lobectomy or bullectomy and in the selection of patients for lung transplantation.\r"

Incarceration of the extraocular muscle or orbital fat was correctly diagnosed with MR imaging, which was less sensitive in depicting maxillofacial fractures but was useful in assessment of soft-tissue involvement. Postoperative follow-up MR studies provided valuable information about the cause of motility impairment. While T1-weighted images are useful for the detection of the fracture site, both T1- and T2-weighted images are usually necessary for evaluating soft-tissue lesions. The results of this study indicate that surface coil MR imaging is an important adjunct procedure in the diagnosis and treatment of orbital fractures.\r"

Statistical tests indicated consistency in interpretation for each observer as well as between observers. No significant difference was found between the two modalities in ability to depict changes in percentage area stenosis. For the 32 right carotid arteries in the comparison, the median for the difference between MR angiography and intraarterial DSA was 1.83% (range, -22.38% to 55.60%); for the 33 visualized left carotid arteries, it was 0.00% (range, -20.55% to 49.95%).

To rigorously evaluate the vascular detail that can be obtained with MOTSA MR angiography, the authors have quantified the frequency of visibility of intracranial arterial segments and have correlated their visibility with vessel size as measured at cut-film angiography and with the position and orientation of the arterial segment. Intracranial arterial segments at least 0.9 mm in diameter (the voxel dimension used in the current application) are consistently visualized with the MOTSA technique. The fraction of small vessels visualized is improved when voxel dimensions are reduced. Visibility is noticeably better in the primary images compared with the maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) images. Top-of-slab saturation and resulting decreased vessel intensity occurred infrequently and did not result in marked image degradation in the axial images.\r"

Retrospective clinical review identified 64 patients with TBH admitted during a 5-year period. Complete imaging and clinical records for 45 of these patients demonstrated that TBH could be categorized into three groups. The most frequent site of hemorrhage, in 31 (69%) of 45 patients (group 1), was the midline rostral anterior brain stem, posterior to the interpeduncular cistern, and this injury was associated with a 71% survival rate. This pattern was also associated with a predominantly anterior site of head and/or face impact. Eight (18%) patients (group 2) had miscellaneous foci of acute brain stem hemorrhage with seven (88%) surviving. Six (13%) patients (group 3) had brain stem hemorrhage associated with transtentorial herniation and brain stem compression, with 100% mortality. Experimental findings in a canine model and clinical results indicate that the anterior rostral midbrain is a common site of TBH and appears to arise from sudden craniocaudal displacement of the brain at impact. Survival is unexpected high with this location of traumatic midbrain hemorrhage.\r"

A review of pathology records for patients with MA who were seen between 1970 and 1989 at the authors' institutions revealed four patients (three male and one female; aged 2.5-21.0 years; mean, 10.8 years) with a history of seizures but without the stigmata or family history of neurofibromatosis. Three patients had undergone either computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. All patients had undergone craniotomies to obtain tissue for pathologic analysis; a peripheral, leptomeningeal lesion was found in all four patients. At CT in two patients, the lesions were most consistent with calcification. At T2-weighted MR imaging in one patient, the lesion demonstrated a hyperintense periphery with associated edema of the white matter. Histopathologic examination demonstrated characteristic features of MA--cortical meningovascular fibroblastic proliferation and leptomeningeal calcification. The accurate diagnosis of MA is important since MA is a benign, surgically correctable cause of seizures.\r"

At least one such lesion exhibited subependymal spread or ventricular encasement in 38%. One-third of lesions in three of five patients who underwent nonenhanced CT were hyperattenuating. Five lesions were at least in part hypointense on T2-weighted MR images. The specificity of these findings was evaluated with a similar review of the imaging studies in 28 patients with AIDS and proved toxoplasmosis. Only 3% of lesions were periventricular. None exhibited subependymal spread or encasement. None were hyperattenuating on nonenhanced CT scans. Similar findings in other CNS lesions in AIDS patients could not be found in the literature. A focal enhancing mass with subependymal spread on CT or MR images and hyperattenuation at nonenhanced CT were the most reliable features in distinguishing between primary CNS lymphoma and toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients.\r"

Six different MR imagers were used, ranging in magnetic field strength from 0.15 T to 1.5 T. For each unit, appropriate T1- and T2-weighted sequences in the transverse plane and T2-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane were used. Initially, 107 patients were entered in the study, but only 88 fulfilled all the criteria and provide the basis for this study. The abnormality within the endometrial cavity was demonstrated with MR imaging in 81% of the patients. The overall accuracy with MR imaging for staging endometrial carcinoma was 85%. In the evaluation of depth of myometrial invasion for stage I disease, overall accuracy with MR imaging was 74%. The accuracy of MR imaging in assessing tumors confined to endometrium or tumor with superficial myometrial invasion was 89% and decreased to 54% in assessing deep myometrial invasion. The results of this prospective study performed by multiple examiners with vastly different equipment demonstrate the inherent value of MR imaging in the evaluation of this neoplasm.\r"

Seven patients underwent angiography and surgery because of solid or complex renal masses identified at cross-sectional imaging. Nine kidneys underwent detailed examination by the surgeon and by a pathologist. There were 31 renal cancers. Angiography had enabled identification of only five cancers (16%), and six others (19%) had been suspected. Cancers detected angiographically were larger than those not detected (P less than .05). Solid tumors tended to appear less hypervascular than expected and occasionally had the angiographic appearance of atypical cysts. There were no false-positive angiograms. Angiography revealed only one cancer not previously suspected and changed the surgeon's approach for only one kidney (11%). The sensitivity and specificity of angiography were 35% and 100%, respectively. In these patients, selective renal angiography is not helpful for the detection or exclusion of cancer in a kidney. It does not have a limited role for vascular mapping prior to partial nephrectomy or tumor enucleation.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the variability in detection of prostate cancer with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors correlated preoperative MR findings in 28 patients with tissue optical density (TOD) measurements on whole-mount pathologic slides prepared from radical prostatectomy specimens. TOD was used as an indicator of the degree of tissue compactness or openness. TOD measurements from proved cancers and from pathologic regions corresponding to MR lesions (areas of low signal intensity seen at T2-weighted MR imaging) were compared with TOD measurements from adjacent, nonmalignant tissue. TOD measurements corresponding to MR lesions were higher than noncancerous tissue measurements in all cases (P less than .005). Although most of these lesions represented cancers (21 of 30), nine of 30 represented benign tissue that was composed mainly of densely packed fibromuscular stroma (30% false-positive results). Thus, signal intensity appeared to be related to TOD rather than to a specific histologic tissue type, and the finding of a peripheral zone lesion with low signal intensity did not necessarily indicate the presence of a cancer.\r"

This last complication, considered to be a sign of sepsis and treated with antibiotics, occurred more frequently than the 1.4%-4.5% infectious complication rate reported in the literature. Antibiotic use during and after PCN significantly decreased the likelihood of sepsis. In the high-risk group, antibiotic administration during and after PCN decreased the risk of developing signs of sepsis from 50% to 9%. On the basis of the authors' results and the findings in the literature about antibiotic prophylaxis, guidelines are recommended to improve the safety of PCN as an outpatient procedure. In the majority of instances PCN should still be considered to be more safely performed as an inpatient procedure at this time.\r"

To test this hypothesis, 101 adult inpatients with high serum creatinine levels (range, 1.4-2.4 mg/dL [120-210 mumol/L]) undergoing contrast material-enhanced computed tomography were randomized to receive ionic or nonionic (low-osmolality) contrast agents in a uniform dose. Changes in serum creatinine level at 48 hours were measured. Seven (14%) of the 50 patients receiving ionic contrast media experienced an increase of 25% or more in serum creatinine level. Only one (2%) of the 51 patients receiving nonionic contrast agents experienced such an increase, a statistically significant difference (P less than .05). In the subset of 25 diabetic patients, the difference was of a similar magnitude. These data suggest that ionic contrast media are more likely than nonionic contrast agents to cause mild exacerbation of renal insufficiency when given intravenously. However, there were no cases of clinically important CN in the study.\r"

Automatically detected left ventricular endocardial surfaces were used to determine the best transform between the two sets of surface points, and that transform was applied to the original SPECT image. A fused image created from the MR and the transformed SPECT images combined the information in both. The authors tested the method with seven patient studies. Registration reduced the distance between the MR and SPECT left ventricular endocardial surfaces by 30%, to an average of 2.7 mm. The authors found that, by using the fused images, perfusion abnormalities could be easily localized and correlated to high-resolution endocardial wall motion and systolic wall thickening.\r"

A selective 180 degrees radio-frequency pulse was applied before data acquisition to suppress the signal intensity of stationary tissues. Vascular images were obtained in 1 second or less by using a single-shot, rapid gradient-echo sequence in conjunction with a very short echo time to minimize flow-related dephasing. Alternatively, the data acquisition could be divided into several segments that were combined to create an image. Because of the short imaging times, abdominal single-shot images were relatively insensitive to motion. The major drawback was decreased spatial resolution and limited signal-to-noise ratio. Spatial resolution of segmented flow images was comparable with that of standard gradient-echo images, but there was a marked reduction in the signal intensity of stationary tissues. For high-resolution MR angiography, the effective background suppression obtained by means of the segmented approach can improve the quality and reliability of images created by the maximum intensity projection algorithm.\r"

  ".W": "MAP recordings have been at the cradle of cardiac electrophysiology but only recently, through safer and simpler technology, have gained wider access to clinical electrophysiology. In contrast to conventional electrode catheter recordings, MAP recording devices provide precise information not only of the local activation time but of the entire local repolarization time course as well. Although the MAP does not reflect the absolute amplitude or upstroke velocity of transmembrane action potentials, it delivers highly accurate information on the action potential duration and configuration, including early afterdepolarizations as well as relative changes in transmembrane diastolic and systolic potential changes. Based on available data, the MAP probably reflects the transmembrane voltage of cells within a few millimeters of the exploring electrode. MAPs can be recorded by catheter technique from the endocardial surface and by special probes from the epicardium in the operating room. The contact electrode technique is preferable over suction electrodes because it is safer and simpler to use in patients and because it produces more stable, longer-lasting signals. A modified contact MAP catheter incorporates pacing electrodes and permits simultaneous assessment of action potential duration and refractoriness. This not only facilitates the use of MAP catheters in routine electrophysiological studies but also is important for assessing the voltage-independent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on refractoriness. MAP recordings offer the opportunity to study, in the in situ heart, a variety of pertinent electrophysiological phenomena including, for example, effects of cycle length changes and antiarrhythmic drugs on action potential duration or the role of afterdepolarizations in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias. Due to vigorous heart beating, movement artifacts may occur and need to be distinguished from true abnormalities in the action potential time course. With these limitations in mind, MAP recordings are a valuable addition to clinical electrophysiological studies.\r"

Consanguinity is associated with increased gross fertility, due at least in part to younger maternal age at first livebirth. Morbidity and mortality also may be elevated, resulting in comparable numbers of surviving offspring in consanguineous and nonconsanguineous families. With advances in medicine and public health, genetic disorders will account for an increased proportion of disease worldwide. Predictably, this burden will fall more heavily on countries and communities in which consanguinity is strongly favored, as the result of the expression of deleterious recessive genes. However, studies conducted in such populations indicate that the adverse effects associated with inbreeding are experienced by a minority of families.\r"

The crystal structure of a complex containing the three zinc fingers from Zif268 (a mouse immediate early protein) and a consensus DNA-binding site has been determined at 2.1 angstroms resolution and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 18.2 percent. In this complex, the zinc fingers bind in the major groove of B-DNA and wrap part way around the double helix. Each finger has a similar relation to the DNA and makes its primary contacts in a three-base pair subsite. Residues from the amino-terminal portion of an alpha helix contact the bases, and most of the contracts are made with the guanine-rich strand of the DNA. This structure provides a framework for understanding how zinc fingers recognize DNA and suggests that this motif may provide a useful basis for the design of novel DNA-binding proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH), an alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme from numerous methylotrophic soil bacteria, contains a novel quinonoid redox prosthetic group that is covalently bound to its small beta subunit through two amino acyl residues. A comparison of the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene sequence of the small subunit for the enzyme from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 with the published amino acid sequence obtained by the Edman degradation method, allowed the identification of the amino acyl constituents of the cofactor as two tryptophyl residues. This information was crucial for interpreting 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectral data collected for the semicarbazide- and carboxymethyl-derivatized bis(tripeptidyl)-cofactor of MADH from bacterium W3A1. The cofactor is composed of two cross-linked tryptophyl residues. Although there are many possible isomers, only one is consistent with all the data: The first tryptophyl residue in the peptide sequence exists as an indole-6,7-dione, and is attached at its 4 position to the 2 position of the second, otherwise unmodified, indole side group. Contrary to earlier reports, the cofactor of MADH is not 2,7,9-tricarboxypyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a derivative thereof, or pro-PQQ. This appears to be the only example of two cross-linked, modified amino acyl residues having a functional role in the active site of an enzyme, in the absence of other cofactors or metal ions.\r"

In the approach described here, patterns in a comprehensive set of microbiological activity and distribution data were analyzed. Measurements were performed on sediment samples gathered at consistent depths in aquifer boreholes spanning a gradient of contaminant concentrations at a buried coal tar site. Microbial adaptation to polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was demonstrated by mineralization of naphthalene and phenanthrene in samples from PAH-contaminated, but not adjacent pristine, zones. Furthermore, contaminant-stimulated in situ bacterial growth was indicated because enhanced numbers of protozoa and their bacterial prey were found exclusively in contaminated subsurface samples. The data suggest that many convergent lines of logically linked indirect evidence can effectively document in situ biodegradation of aquifer contaminants.\r"

The data presented here demonstrate that pX entered into a protein-protein complex with the cellular transcriptional factors CREB and ATF-2 and altered their DNA binding specificities. Although CREB and ATF-2 alone did not bind to the HBV enhancer element, a pX-CREB or pX-ATF-2 complex did bind to the HBV enhancer. Thus, the ability of pX to interact with cellular factors broadened the DNA binding specificity of these regulatory proteins and provides a mechanism for pX to participate in transcriptional regulation. This strategy of altered binding specificity may modify the repertoire of genes that can be regulated by transcriptional factors during viral infection.\r"

PDGF induced the formation of complexes consisting of wild-type and truncated receptors. Such complexes were defective in autophosphorylation. When truncated receptors were expressed in excess compared to wild-type receptors, stimulation by PDGF of receptor autophosphorylation, association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase with the receptor, and calcium mobilization were blocked. Thus, a truncated receptor can inactivate wild-type receptor function by forming ligand-dependent receptor complexes (probably heterodimers) that are incapable of mediating the early steps of signal transduction.\r"

Unlike the NMDA receptor channels, non-NMDA receptor channels have usually been thought to conduct monovalent cations only. Non-NMDA receptor ion channels that can be gated by kainic acid (KA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) are formed by the glutamate receptor subunits GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3. These subunits were expressed in various combinations in Xenopus oocytes so that their permeability to divalent cations could be studied. At physiological resting potentials, KA and AMPA elicited inward calcium currents in oocytes expressing GluR1, GluR3, and GluR1 plus GluR3. In contrast, oocytes expressing GluR1 plus GluR2 or GluR3 plus GluR2 showed no such permeability. Thus, in neurons expressing certain KA-AMPA receptor subunits, glutamate may trigger calcium-dependent intracellular events by activating non-NMDA receptors.\r"

  ".W": "Although the role of growth factors in the regulation of phenotype, maintenance, and repair of cartilaginous tissues has been extensively evaluated, the response of intervertebral disc to growth factors has not been investigated. A tissue culture system for annular, transitional, and nuclear regions of mature canine intervertebral disc was devised to assess the proliferative response, as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, and the biosynthetic response, assayed by 35S-sulfate incorporation into proteoglycan, of these tissues to growth factors. The culture system achieved steady-state conditions in serum-free mediums at 4 days and was perturbed by plasma-derived equine serum, fetal calf serum, insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta. Incorporation rates by the tissue regions of up to five times the control rate were recorded; the nucleus and transition zone responded more than anulus. Transforming growth factor-beta and epidermal growth factor elicited greater responses than fibroblast growth factor; insulin-like growth factor-1 produced a marginally significant response in the nucleus and no response in the anulus and transition. The intervertebral disc appeared to respond to the growth factors differently than cartilage, and this may represent inherent differences in cell biology. The biologic significance and basis of these responses require further evaluation. However, the responses observed, particularly in the nucleus and transition zone suggest the possibility that disc repair can be modulated by growth factors. A therapeutic approach to degenerative disc disease involving enhanced tissue repair by exogenous growth factors would be of great clinical significance.\r"

Of these patients 88% had fusions with instrumentation and polymethylmethacrylate; 88% of patients had partial or complete relief of pain; and 64% of bedridden patients subsequently were able to walk. Neurologic function improved in 60% of patients with a neurologic deficit; however, only 36% of incontinent patients regained bladder control. Survival averaged 8.0 +/- 1.5 months. Survival correlated with the degree of neurologic dysfunction and the presence of other known metastases. Recurrent cord compression developed in 49% of patients, usually at the same level; 9 of these 16 patients had repeat decompression, with similar operative results as the primary procedure in terms of pain and neurologic function. Blood loss was variable but often significant. Preoperative embolization appeared to be beneficial. Precise tumor localization preoperatively directing the surgical approach and better patient selection would likely improve results and decrease morbidity. Good palliation appeared to be achieved in regards to both pain relief and improved neurologic function.\r"

Discectomy of a single level was performed on 48 cases and two levels on 7. There were 37 patients with radiculopathy, and 18 patients with myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy who were followed clinically for 2-13 years postoperatively. Overall 81% of patients were improved in soft disc herniation, and no significant differences were noted between the group of radiculopathy and myelopathy. In spondylosis all but one patient reported initial relief of their preoperative symptoms; however, overall improvement was noted in only 16 patients (47%). The causes of symptomatic deterioration after ACD for spondylosis were later symptomatic recurrence in 5 patients, severe neck pain in 4, and development of new symptoms due to adjacent spur formation in 2. The authors eventually added interbody fusion in 4 cases. Cervical spine roentgenograms almost always showed a loss of height of the interspace and an anterior angulation immediately after ACD, but the alignment of the spine tended to improve with time, so that, at last follow-up, 82% had a good alignment. A spontaneous osseous fusion occurred in 74% of cases. An adjacent spur formation was observed in 3 patients with spondylosis. The most troublesome complication was neck and/or scapular pain. This pain usually subsided spontaneously, but this continued for more than 4 years postoperatively in 4 patients with spondylosis. Using an operating microscope ACD is a safe and effective procedure for patients with soft disc herniation, but the authors still prefer anterior cervical discectomy with interbody fusion for the patients with advanced spondylosis.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of previous studies on the vertebral column and thoracic skeleton, the author generated a hypothesis for the mechanism of production of scoliosis. According to this hypothesis, vertical stability of the thoracic spine is maintained by equal support through the ribs from both sides due to the equal load brought to the lamin by both the ribs through the costotransverse articulations and ligaments. Any interference in this balancing mechanism will disturb the mechanism of spinal stability, and the spine will bend toward the more heavier loaded side at the intervertebral joints. On the basis of this hypothesis, mechanisms of production of scoliosis (both in experimental animals and humans) after removal of ribs on one side can be explained. Removal of the ribs from one side produces an imbalance in the symmetric weight transmission through the ribs on the two sides. Pathologic deformations within the vertebrae in scoliosis results from the asymmetric load and the altered route of the load transmission on the convex side of the curve.\r"

This study evaluated its effectiveness in 12 Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing Harrington instrumentation and fusion who refused transfusion. Previous series from this institute did not use deliberate hypotension because of routinely low blood loss. Compared with matched controls operated on under normotensive anesthesia, the Jehovah's Witness patients had lower absolute blood loss but also shorter operative time. Applied linear-regression analysis demonstrated that the diminished blood loss was associated with shorter operative time (P = 0.0002) rather than lower blood pressure. The majority of blood losses in spinal instrumentation with fusion occurs with decortication. This rapid bleeding occurs at venous pressures which are unaffected by arterial blood pressure manipulation. The authors conclude that spinal surgery is possible in Jehovah's Witnesses without transfusion and that operative technique is the single most important determinant of blood loss.\r"

Objectives were to review results of surgical treatment and identify factors affecting results. Charts, 3 foot standing anteroposterior and lateral and supine maximal side bending radiographs were reviewed. Subjective data were obtained by telephone. There were 26 patients, average age 41 years. Average radiographic follow-up was 48 months. Indications were pain and curve progression. Average correction was 63% of the instrumented curve. Average change of lordosis was 8 degrees and kyphosis was 6 degrees. Apical vertebral rotation corrected an average of 37%. Complications were: eight hardware failures, one deep infection, and two psychiatric events. The high-risk groups: curves greater than 60 degrees, patients older than 50 years of age, and rigid curves.\r"

  ".W": "A computer-assisted instrument, the isotechnologies B-200, was compared with double goniometer technique for measuring flexion-extension and lateral bending and a compass technique for measuring axial rotation. Test-retest measurements were performed, and the reliability of each method was determined. Generally, low correlations were obtained between two tests performed 1 week apart. The B-200 had poor reproducibility in flexion-extension, particularly when measured separately. Somewhat better results were obtained in lateral bending and rotation. With the goniometers r values close to 0.8 were obtained in flexion, and statistically significantly repeatable data were also obtained in combined flexion-extension and right rotation. Because of the poor repeatability statistical analysis comparing the two instruments was not meaningful. The authors conclude that an instrument such as the B-200 should not be used to measure range of motion. Inexpensive tools allow accurate measurements of, at least, flexion and extension. Small changes should not be taken to indicate true improvement or deterioration. Measurements to a single degree are not meaningful.\r"

Compared with HB subjects, in the most stable and then the least stable balance positions, the LBP subjects demonstrated significantly greater postural sway, kept their center of force (COF) significantly more posterior, and were significantly less likely to be able to balance on one foot with eyes closed. Based on subjective observations, the LBP subjects were more likely to fulcrum about the hip and back to maintain uprightness in challenging balance tasks compared with healthy controls who maintained their fulcrum for the COF around the ankle. Research is needed to determine the incidence of balance problems in LBP patients compared with controls. Effective physical therapy assessment and treatment of LBP patients may require attention to postural alignment, strength, flexibility, joint stability, balance reactions, and postural strategies.\r"

The disc degeneration was simulated by removing the hydrostatic capabilities of the nucleus and making the L4-L5 disc stiffer than a normal disc. The results of the degenerated model were compared with the predictions for a model in which the L4-L5 disc was left intact. The loads on the facets decreased, and intradiscal pressure in the intact L3-L4 disc increased as a result of disc degeneration compared with the intact model. The predicted increase in the intradiscal pressure and the associated increase in the disc bulge in the posterior region over time may trigger the degenerative process at the L3-L4 motion segment. This is in accordance with the Wolff's law; living tissue responds to chronic changes in stresses and strains. The limitations of the present two motion segments model and the potentials of multisegmental models are discussed.\r"

These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs.\r"

  ".W": "The selection of surgical approach for patients suffering from acute thoracolumbar spinal trauma is presently imbued with great controversy. The surgical method chosen depends on the type of fracture, anatomic and biomechanical factors, and the habits and experience of the surgeon involved. Due to new techniques for the posterior approach and the use of internal fixators, the indications for the anterior approach must be reassessed. The primary indication for anterior decompression and grafting is narrowing of the spinal canal with neurologic deficits that cannot be resolved by any other approach. Additional indications are seen in patients with vertebral body fractures with complete comminution and dislocation, noncorrectable burst fractures, and late misalignments. After removal of vertebral body and intervertebral disc fragments, autogenous bone should preferably be used for interposition. Different plates can be used for instrumentation. While anterior plates most often offer complete stability for the thoracic spine and a dorsal plating in this region can turn out to be quite difficult, in the lumbar spine, especially with destruction of additional posterior structures, one must think of subsequent surgical intervention for increased stability and compressive posterior fusion with short-armed internal fixators. So far, we have gained experience from treating 39 patients with anterior decompression and stabilization. One of 19 patients with Frankel Grades A and B and 50% of the remaining 20 patients had improved one Frankel grade. Only a few of the patients with incomplete neurologic symptoms had back pain. All except for one returned to work. According to radiologic examinations, the average loss of correction amounted to 7%.\r"

Using a proper bone grafting technique, it is a reliable device to establish spinal stability in spine surgery through an anterior approach. Its application in cases of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine with paraplegia, tuberculous spondylitis, and primary tumors of vertebral bodies is presented. The midterm results, covering a follow-up period of 24-49 months (mean, 32 months) were satisfactory; there were no serious complications directly related to the device. There were four cases of pseudarthrosis due to insufficient bone graft technique. Of these, there were three cases of failure of the dual-blade plate.\r"

The consecutive analysis of morphologic results led to modifications of the original Roy-Camille technique. In analogy to the system developed by Zielke for anterior derotation spondylodesis, plates were used in combination with VDS screws, threaded rods, and nuts, thus creating an implant with initial angle variability but final angle stability. The development of transpedicular reduction and cancellous bone grafting for the treatment of vertebral body fractures, later supplemented by transpedicular discectomy and intercorporal cancellous bone grafting, effected a significant improvement in the results of posterior plating. Although the use of traditional plating was followed by correction losses of 14 degrees, the loss could be reduced to less than 6 degrees by the new system, which nearly corresponds to the physiologic anatomy of the spine.\r"

This article details the results of 23 patients who were followed for an average of 20 months. The indications for the procedure were an unstable fracture--dislocation below the eighth thoracic vertebra or low lumbar fractures that would be difficult to treat with conventional spinal implants. The patients were divided into three groups based on the fracture pattern and the level of the fracture. Group I consisted of fracture--dislocation injuries at the thoracic level and thoracolumbar junction. Group II patients sustained lumbar fracture--dislocations, and Group III contained lumbar burst fractures. Sagittal and coronal angles as well as anterior and posterior vertebral body height were measured at the injury level preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 3-month intervals. Statistical analysis of these angles demonstrated that Group I and III patients had significant correction of their relative kyphotic deformity after surgery; however, there were no differences in kyphotic angle at the 3-month interval. Despite this eventual return to preoperative angles, all patients except one developed solid fusion. There was no increase in neurologic deficit. One patient developed an asymptomatic pseudarthrosis demonstrated by breakage of both plates through unfilled screw holes at the motion segment. Other complications included one wound infection, one case of arachnoiditis after an intradural bone fragment was excised, and one dural tear created by a Kirschner wire, which did not result in a neurologic deficit or a cerebrospinal fluid leak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean wedge angle of the fractured vertebra was corrected from 17.4 degrees to 7.9 degrees and remained almost unchanged after 1 year (8.4 degrees) and 2 years, or 1 year after implant removal (8.2 degrees). Also, the wedge index showed nearly no bony loss of correction within the reduced fracture vertebra (0.61 before operation, 0.83 after operation; 0.81 at 1-year follow-up, 0.81 at 2-year follow-up, respectively). In the kyphosis angle measured by the Cobb method, however, there was a loss of 5 degrees after implant removal within the next year because of the disc space collapsed above the fractured vertebra. In this series, 70% of the cases had no formal fusion. All 29 cases of translational displacement of 4-36 mm were anatomically reduced. No neurologic or vascular complication occurred. Posterolateral fusion or transpedicular interbody fusion in the disrupted disc space is recommended.\r"

A displacement of 1.2 mm and a strain of 10% was found at the L5-L6 joint, where fusion always occurred when the same type of bone grafts were applied in the same manner (described above) over the decorticated lamina of L5 and L6. Firm fixation of the lumbosacral spine and bone graft has brought about an arthrodesis in this model, presumably because the displacement and strain had been limited to acceptable levels. Data are presented to support the concept that, because the spine is composed of bony elements separated by a disc with viscoelastic properties, the biomechanics of spinal fixation and fusion are different than the biomechanics of long bone fixation and fracture healing. These differences should be considered in the design and use of spinal fixation devices.\r"

Some surgeons, however, feel that the existing plate-screw designs are too rigid and are the primary cause of \"iatrogenic\" adverse effects clinically observed. A three-part study, involving in vitro experimental protocol, analytical finite-element-based models, and an in vivo canine investigation, was undertaken to study the role of decreasing rigidity of a device on the biomechanical response of the stabilized segments. Two alternatives--the use of one variable screw placement (Steffee plate [unilateral, 1VSP model]) as opposed to two VSP plates (bilateral, 2VSP model) and two VSP plates with polymer washers placed in between the integral nut and plate (2MVSP model)--were considered for achieving a reduction in the rigidity of the conventional VSP system. The load-displacement data obtained from the in vitro experiments and the stress distributions within the stabilized and intact models predicted by the finite-element models revealed that the unilateral VSP system is less rigid and is likely to reduce stress shielding of the vertebral bodies compared with the 2VSP model. The undesirable effects associated with the use of the 1VSP plate system are the presence of coupled motions due to the inherent asymmetry and the likely inability to provide enough rigidity for decompression procedures requiring a complete excision of the disc. The use of two MVSP plates overcomes these deficiencies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preoperatively, all patients underwent spinal imaging with either magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or myelogram as well as provocative discography to determine the location and the number of symptomatic segments. The minimum follow-up in this series was 2 years. The determination of solid posterior fusion in the presence of plate instrumentation was difficult. The patients in the series were classified as having 1) solid fusion; 2) radiographic flaws within the posterolateral fusion without implant failure; or 3) frank pseudarthrosis with implant failure. Thirty-six (80%) of the patients had a solid fusion, 9 of whom required an additional anterior interbody fusion to obtain symptom control. Twenty percent of the patients in the series had radiographic evidence of reabsorption without implant failure. Four patients in the series (8.8%) had screw breakage, three of which required anterior interbody fusions. The highest rate of reabsorption and pseudarthrosis implant failure was in the 12 patients who had three-level instrumentation; 33% of these patients required anterior interbody fusion to obtain a solid arthrodesis. The average preoperative pain scale was 8.9, and the average postoperative pain scale was a 3.3. Twenty-two patients in the series were cigarette smokers and had a slightly lower fusion rate than non-smokers. They did, however, have a higher use of narcotics after surgery. Forty percent of the patients in this series continued to have radiculopathy after their reconstruction. This study demonstrates the utility of transpedicular fixation in salvage lumbar surgery in obtaining a solid arthrodesis with a beneficial clinical result. Anterior interbody fusions are highly successful in the management of pseudarthrosis and implant failure after transpedicular instrumentation.\r"

Anatomic dens fracture reduction with stable internal screw fixation satisfies the established principles of the AO/ASIF. Iatrogenic trauma is minimized by the use of an anterior surgical approach, and no supplemental bone grafting is required. This procedure is quite prone to complications when performed improperly or in contraindicated situations. The use of meticulous surgical technique along with a newly designed cannulated screw system has evolved this procedure into an established form of treatment at our department. Since 1982, 23 patients were treated with direct screw fixation of dens fractures. The overall rate of fracture union was 92.3%, and fracture resolution averaged 5.5 months. The major complication rate of 17% (4/23) resulted from inappropriate use of this technique. The 11 most recent cases, all of which involved stabilization with cannulated screws, resulted in only a single complication (9%) and an average fracture healing time of 3.5 months. A recommended operative technique for anterior screw fixation of dens fractures will be presented along with a discussion of potential sources of difficulty or failures.\r"

Forty-three patients were neurologically intact. There were no relevant complications except in one patient, who needed reoperation because of a secondary redislocation due to a technically insufficient osteosynthesis. The technique of anterior bone grafting and plating is shown to be straight-forward, atraumatic, and reliable for predominantly anterior lesions as well as for posterior injuries when performed properly. This clinical experiences does not support experimental data and earlier clinical work, which advocate posterior surgery over anterior surgery and assert that anterior surgery should not be done in predominantly posterior lesions.\r"

A cadaveric model is presented that allows flexural and torsional testing of a cervical spine motion segment, measuring the tilting angle, the translation, and the torsional angle. After measuring the intact segments, in the first series, a so-called posterior instability was created and stabilized posteriorly with the hook-plate and sublaminar wiring; anteriorly with the H-plate; and with combinations of these implants. In a second series, their stabilizing effect after complete discoligamentous instability was tested. With isolated posterior instability, it was found that the flexural stability is preserved, whereas torsional stability is markedly reduced. In cases of isolated posterior instability, only hook plating alone or its combination with anterior H-plating seemed to bring about a higher torsional stability than the intact specimen. In cases of complete discoligamentous instability, only anterior H-plate and posterior hook plate procedures combined or the hook plate alone was able to guarantee both torsional and flexural stability higher than the intact spine. Exclusive posterior wiring without postoperative external immobilization in complete discoligamentous instability may result in permanent subluxation of the functional unit. Exclusive anterior H-plate fixation in complete discoligamentous instability requires additional external immobilization in the postoperative phase to prevent flexion and torsion.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of posterior arthrodesis of the cervical spine with AO reconstruction plates and autogenous bone graft was evaluated in a prospective study. The technique of surgical exposure and the application of the reconstruction plates fixed with screws to the lateral masses is described in detail. Of 30 patients with unstable cervical spines, all had solid fusions based on flexion and extension radiographs at follow-up averaging 17.8 months. No patient's neurologic function deteriorated. All incomplete spinal cord injuries improved at least one Frankel level. There were no neurologic or vascular complications. At follow-up, three patients had fusions extending one level longer than those instrumented. Three other patients had an increase in kyphosis compared with the operative reduction, which was not clinically significant. Although a single screw loosened in three other patients, none had an increased deformity, and all progressed to successful arthrodesis. This technique is particularly advantageous when spinous processes, laminas, and facets are injured or deficient, or when facet-type fusions are indicated.\r"

Fifteen patients with tumor involvement of the cervical or thoracic spine and neurologic deficit were treated by single-stage anterior decompression and AO plate stabilization. No patient suffered neurologic deterioration after surgery. All patients with thoracic lesions who were unable to walk on presentation and who managed to survive their primary disease improved to a level that allowed independent ambulation with a frame. There were no problems, such as loss of fixation or deformity. It is concluded that standard AO plates provide adequate stabilization of the cervical and thoracic spine after vertebrectomy for tumor involvement.\r"

  ".W": "The transplantation of multiple abdominal viscera, including liver-duodenum-pancreas, liver-stomach-duodenum-pancreas and liver-intestine, is being performed with increasing frequency and success. These procedures and other variations are derived from a seldom used multivisceral operation in which all of the foregoing organs are transplanted en bloc. It is described herein how the full multivisceral transplantation and its less extensive derivatives are based on the same principles of procurement, preservation and postoperative management. With all of these multiple organ permutations and with intestinal transplantation alone, management is complicated by inclusion in the grafts of a large lymphoreticular component that is capable of causing graft versus host disease (GVHD). Because of a systematic error in therapeutic philosophy, past efforts have been directed at altering or damaging the lymphoreticular cells by pretreatment of the donor or of the organs with drugs, irradiation or other means. From recent observations, the alternative approach is suggested of keeping these lymphoid depots intact, which then become the site of two way cell traffic after transplantation. With the use of powerful immunosuppression, such as that provided with FK 506, the donor lymphoreticular cells can circulate in the recipient without causing clinical GVHD, and the lymphoreticular cells in the graft become those of the recipient (local chimerism) without causing rejection. Even with avoidance of rejection and GVHD, metabolic interrelations between the grafted organs, and also between the graft organs and retained recipient viscera can affect the fate of the individual transplanted organs or retained recipient organs. The best delineated of these metabolic influences are mediated by the endogenous splanchnic hepatotrophic factors, of which insulin has been the most completely studied. An understanding of these various immunologic and nonimmunologic factors combined with more potent immunosuppression that is now available is sure to stimulate efforts at transplantation of abdominal organs and particularly of the hollow viscera that have resisted such clinical efforts.\r"

Elastase was elevated in normal aortas of the infrarenal region (1.10 milliunits per gram, p less than 0.05), and in atherosclerotic descendens aneurysms (1.24 milliunits per gram, p less than 0.05), compared with the ascending aorta, when normal; aneurysmatic specimens revealed similar low elastolytic activities (0.10 milliunits per gram). The highest elastase content was found in infrarenal aneurysms (4.65 milliunits per gram). Collagenase assays yielded no significant differences, although higher activities were extracted from aortas of the infrarenal region. Coexistent atherosclerosis and wall destruction were evaluated by macroscopic and histologic investigation. All infrarenal specimens demonstrated severe atherosclerotic wall degeneration with depletion of elastic fibers. As the atherosclerotic specimens did not differ from normal aortas by protease assay, the higher elastase of infrarenal samples compared with the thoracic aorta suggests a more rapid fiber metabolism in the infrarenal region. The significantly elevated elastolytic activity of infrarenal aneurysms points to the decisive role of elastase in infrarenal aneurysm formation.\r"

In most, inoperable recurrences clinically resembled primary inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. All inoperable failures occurred in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and were associated with the presence of unfavorable prognostic features (positive nodes, histologic grade 3, negative estrogen receptor, vascular invasion and lymphocytic stromal reaction). Despite doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, prognosis after inoperable recurrence was quite poor, although survival time in excess of two years was seen in receptor positive, lower grade recurrent tumors in which treatment included hormone therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, we examined the influence of pre-existing obesity (weight more than 120 per cent of ideal body weight) on outcome after renal transplantation. Among 263 cyclosporine-treated recipients of renal allografts, 223 (85 per cent) were nonobese and 40 (15 per cent) were obese prior to transplantation. Obese and nonobese recipients were similar with regard to age, sex, renal diagnosis, history of prior transplant, donor source, pretransplant blood pressure, pretransplant antihypertensive agents, diabetic recipients with insulin requirements more than 40 units per day and pretransplant serum cholesterol. Duration of hospitalization was similar (26 +/- 25 versus 25 +/- 14 days; p = NS). There was a significantly higher incidence of wound infections in obese recipients (17.5 versus 6.3 per cent; p = 0.036); other complications occurred with similar incidence. Preoperative per cent of ideal body weight correlated with post-transplant weight gain during the first post-transplant year (p = 0.00002). After one year, obese recipients had gained 14.2 +/- 2.2 kilograms compared with 8.9 +/- 0.6 kilograms for nonobese patients (p = 0.002). Mean doses of prednisone, azathioprine and cyclosporine were similar at three, six and 12 months post-transplant. There were no differences in blood cyclosporine, serum cholesterol or blood glucose levels at any time. Blood pressure measurements were similar throughout the first post-transplant year. There was no difference in the incidence or number of rejection episodes. Actuarial patient survival rate for nonobese patients was 93 per cent at three years. For obese patients, three year actuarial patient survival rate was 90.5 per cent (p = NS). Actuarial graft survival rate among nonobese patients was 71.8 per cent at three years. For obese patients, three year actuarial graft survival rate was 64.5 per cent (p = NS). In conclusion, obese patients with end stage renal disease are good candidates for renal transplantation. Obesity does not seem to constitute a major risk factor, the most notable adverse outcomes being an increased incidence of wound infection and continued weight gain through the first post-transplant year.\r"

Patients at increased risk were more than 80 years of age, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention, had preoperative systolic blood pressure levels of less than 90 millimeters of mercury and had a preoperative hemoglobin level of less than 8. Other factors associated with death were a delay in beginning surgical treatment, a larger total blood loss and amount of blood transfused. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope and the amount of blood loss were, in large part, reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The most effective method of preventing fatal outcome is elective resection of the aneurysms before rupture occurs.\r"

This method, however, has not been studied widely. Previous reports failed to grade the severity of the renal injury and involved small patient series and historic control for comparison of nephrectomy rates. We studied 297 patients with renal trauma during a ten year period. Sixty-three of 75 patients with penetrating injuries and 12 of 222 patients with blunt injuries underwent renal exploration. We obtained vascular control prior to opening Gerota's fascia in 32 patients; it was obtained in 43 patients after opening Gerota's fascia. The nephrectomy rate depended on the degree of injury rather than on the type of renal vascular control obtained. Obtaining vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia did not increase the nephrectomy rate and shortened operative time by an average of 58 minutes. We recommend vascular control after opening Gerota's fascia when there is a large hematoma crossing the midline, a rapidly expanding renal hematoma, if the patient is unstable, or if Gerota's fascia has already been opened by the injury.\r"

Basilar artery caliber and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the occipital cortex were reduced by 42% and 43% during delayed vasospasm, respectively. Once delayed vasospasm had developed, intravenous infusion of OKY-046, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase, induced no significant change in angiographic vasospasm but caused a significant increase in rCBF. In delayed vasospasm, cortical levels of PGF2 alpha were significantly decreased, whereas plasma levels of PGF2 alpha and TXB2 in the transverse sinus were significantly increased. The intravenous infusion of OKY-046 in delayed vasospasm induced a significant increase in cortical PGF2 alpha and PGE in the occipital cortex, and caused a significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a significant decrease in plasma TXB2 in the transverse sinus. In delayed vasospasm, decreased cortical levels of PGF2 alpha may reflect a decrease in rCBF and increased plasma PGF2 alpha and TXB2 levels may reflect enhancement of intravascular coagulation. These PGs have very strong and various biological activities. The results suggest that SAH induces complicated changes of intracranial PGs and OKY-046 can improve these pathological changes.\r"

Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid-like cystic fluid revealed high levels of protein and pituitary hormones. Histological study revealed that the cyst wall was composed of connective tissue and arachnoid cells, which were ultrastructurally characterized by a number of desmosomes. Diagnostic, surgical, and pathological features of intrasellar arachnoid cysts are discussed.\r"

An enlarged cord with strand-shape or longitudinal hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images was noticed in the hemorrhagic infarct; hypointensity on the T2-weighted image was thought to be due to hemosiderin, which shortens T2 relaxation. In the ischemic infarct, a small, round area of hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, noted 9 hours postictus (\"early infarct\") changed on the 22nd day to a cephalocaudal strandlike hypointensity on T1-weighted image, which was enhanced by Gd-DTPA. The hypointensity suggested \"pencil-like softening\" in \"medium\" age infarct. On postictal day 49, it showed an extensive homogeneous hypointensity involving several segments of the cord on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with negative Gd-DTPA enhancement suggesting \"late transverse infarct.\" We considered that these changes are of value in diagnosing spinal cord infarcts on magnetic resonance imagings.\r"

These complications occur in about 35% of reported series with current microballoon embolization techniques. The wall of the new thrombogenic microballoon allows 80% aneurysm occlusion by inflation, thus avoiding mechanical rupture, and at the same time it produces a blood clot in the space remaining between the microballoon and the aneurysm wall. This clot undergoes fibrosis with firm adherence of the microballoon to the aneurysm wall. Experimental evidence is presented to support these conclusions. This thrombogenic microballoon system is also applicable to carotid-cavernous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations.\r"

Twelve healthy male doctors, aged 25-36 (mean 30) years, were studied. After a week's run in period eight subjects inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate 2000 micrograms/day and eight inhaled budesonide 1800 micrograms/day for 28 days; this was followed by a week without any treatment. During treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate there was a significant increase in the hydroxyproline:creatinine ratio (a 46% increase at 28 days), and a fall in serum alkaline phosphatase activity (a 7.4% fall at 28 days). There were no significant changes during budesonide treatment. Thus high dose inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate increased biochemical markers of bone resorption and reduced serum alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone mineralisation. A prospective study in asthmatic patients is indicated to assess the long term effects of high dose inhaled corticosteroids on bone mass.\r"

In the 108 patients with the full series of throat swabs the incidence of oropharyngeal colonisation by H influenzae was 16% and was unchanged after operation. S pneumoniae was present in only 5.6 (six patients) before operation and the incidence fell to 1.9% (two patients). There was a transient rise in coliform colonisation postoperatively. Twenty four patients developed a chest infection. In eight a bacterial cause was established, in six H influenzae and in two S pneumoniae. There was a significant relation between the carriage of H influenzae before operation and development of a chest infection. H influenzae was also found more often in cigarette smokers. The presence of S pneumoniae or coliform organisms before surgery was not related to the development of infection. The high incidence of postoperative chest infection in cigarette smokers appears to be due in part to preoperative colonisation of the oropharynx by H influenzae.\r"

The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients).

The CVACE regimen was identical to the VACE regimen for cycles 3 and 4; cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 consisted of etoposide 110 mg/m2 for three days plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2 with mannitol diuresis on the second day. Forty eight patients received VACE and 47 CVACE. Side effects resulted in withdrawal of four patients receiving VACE and six receiving CVACE. Three deaths were attributed to VACE and one to CVACE. Median survival did not differ between the two treatments overall, though there was a small increase in median survival in partial responders receiving CVACE. It is concluded that replacing four of the six cycles of VACE (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide) with etoposide and cisplatin conferred no overall advantage.\r"

On initial assessment, 43 patients had symptoms of lung disease and 10 had related physical signs; the chest radiograph was abnormal in five. There was a significant reduction (more than 2 standardised residuals) in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), and TLCO in 14, 12, and 10 patients, 24 patients overall having a significant reduction in one or more of these measures. There was a strong relation between reduction in lung function and both pulmonary symptoms and a lip biopsy specimen positive for Sjogren's syndrome. Lung function at the initial assessment in the 30 patients who were restudied was almost identical to that of the group as a whole. Seventeen now had symptoms and nine had related physical signs. The chest radiograph was abnormal in four patients. More patients had a significant reduction in FEV1, VC, and TLCO.

Leukotriene generation was also assessed in vivo by measuring urinary leukotriene (LT) E4 excretion, and ex vivo by measuring calcium ionophore stimulated whole blood LTB4 production. Zileuton almost completely inhibited ex vivo LTB4 production but reduced urinary excretion of LTE4 by only about half. There was a trend for the early asthmatic response to be less on the day of zileuton treatment, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). The zileuton induced reduction in maximum fall in FEV1 in the early asthmatic response was, however, significantly related to the reduction in urinary LTE4 excretion (r = 0.8), but not to the reduction in LTB4 generation ex vivo. There was no significant change in the allergen induced late asthmatic response, or in the increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine following antigen. The results provide some support for the hypothesis that the cysteinyl leukotrienes have a role in the allergen induced early asthmatic response. More complete in vivo inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase may be needed to produce a significant reduction in airway response to allergen challenge.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work suggests a role for mast cell derived mediators in exercise induced asthma. The contribution of newly generated contractile prostaglandins to exercise induced asthma was assessed by using a potent and orally active thromboxane (TP1) receptor antagonist, GR32191. The effect of 120 mg GR32191 on exercise induced asthma was observed in 12 asthmatic subjects. For the exercise challenge the subjects performed six minutes of treadmill exercise, breathing dry air at a work load that had previously been shown to induce a fall in FEV1 of 25% or more from the pre-exercise baseline. No effect of GR32191 on pre-exercise baseline airway calibre was evident. There was no significant difference in the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 from baseline after exercise between drug and placebo (placebo 30.2%, GR32191 day 31.6%). It is concluded that the thromboxane antagonist GR32191 has no effect on exercise induced asthma. This suggests that prostaglandins, including PGD2, that act via the thromboxane receptor do not have an important role in exercise induced asthma.\r"

Thirty one children aged 2.8-8.3 years were studied, of whom 20 had asthma (10 with frequent nocturnal symptoms) and 11 had no respiratory problems (control subjects). Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured with a Wright's peak flow meter and functional residual capacity (FRC) by a helium gas dilution technique after 30 minutes of lying supine; the values were compared with FRC measured sitting and PEF standing. Peak flow fell significantly on adoption of the supine posture in the asthmatic children, but there was no difference in this fall between the asthmatic children with and without nocturnal symptoms. FRC also fell on adoption of the supine posture, but the decrease in FRC was significant only in the control children and the asthmatic children without nocturnal symptoms. The failure to find a greater fall in PEF or a greater change in FRC on adoption of the supine posture among asthmatic children with nocturnal symptoms suggests that mechanisms other than increased impairment of lung function are responsible for nocturnal asthma.\r"

The effect of muscarinic receptor blockade with intravenous atropine at 0400 hours on these measurements was also studied. Platelet activation, assessed as the ration of beta thromboglobulin to platelet factor 4, was highest when the peak expiratory flow rate was at its lowest in the asthmatic subjects. There was no correlation between platelet activation and plasma catecholamine concentrations. Intravenous atropine did not alter the ratio of beta thromboglobulin to platelet factor 4, suggesting that parasympathetic activity is not the cause of the increased platelet activation at night.\r"

Of the 200 patients, 14% (28) were receiving anticoagulants; among these 28 patients hematoma volume averaged 72 ml and mortality 57% (16 patients). The 140 survivors were followed for 2-24 months. Our findings indicate that anticoagulation therapy after previous cerebral infarction or embolism of cardiogenic origin did not predispose to intracerebral hemorrhage. Prognosis was poor when the initial level of consciousness was low and the hematoma volume exceeded 50 ml in combination with dilatation of the contralateral ventricle. An intracerebral hematoma of greater than 80 ml volume was always fatal, regardless of therapy. With volumes of 40-80 ml, early surgical evacuation of the lobar hematoma may improve outcome.\r"

  ".W": "The prevailing belief that transient ischemic attack is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is based primarily on comparisons of survival of patients after transient ischemic attacks to that of an age-, race-, and sex-adjusted general population. Concomitant conditions that carry a high risk of premature mortality or morbidity, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes, are very prevalent among patients with transient ischemic attacks. Hence, the poor prognosis of such patients may be attributable to these factors rather than their transient ischemic attack per se, which may only serve to bring patients into the medical system. We compared the survival of 336 patients after transient ischemic attack to that of a control group with a similar risk factor profile consisting of 6,710 patients evaluated for cardiac catheterization. Survival estimates, both unadjusted and adjusted for risk factors, did not differ between the two groups. Three-year survival estimates, after adjustment to the mean value of covariates, were 94% for the patients with transient ischemic attacks and 91% for the controls. These results suggest that the transient ischemic attack may not be an independent risk factor for mortality, although it may identify patients already at increased risk from coexisting conditions.\r"

To clarify the clinical features of ischemic stroke occurring in infants and children, we evaluated 54 cases of cerebral infarction, excluding cases of moyamoya disease, in patients less than 16 years old at 24 clinics in the Tohoku (northeast) district of Japan. We observed two incidence peaks, one in little children and the other in junior high school students. Infection and minor head trauma were more frequently seen prior to ischemic strokes than was heart disease. The middle cerebral artery region, including the basal ganglia, was most commonly affected (49 patients, 91%) on computed tomograms. Angiography was performed in 48 patients (89%) and showed various types of occlusive lesions, mostly affecting the middle cerebral artery. Hemiparesis was the most common form of disability following ischemic strokes (48 patients, 89%). Surgical treatment was carried out in seven patients (13%). The clinical course of these cases showed that the recovery of children after a stroke tends to be better than that of adults, but that permanent disabilities, such as hemiparesis or mental retardation, occur commonly. Further investigation of juvenile cerebrovascular disease is important to prevent ischemic strokes in children.\r"

There were large and statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in the rates of hemorrhagic stroke over this period. Dramatic increases occurred among men in the rates of both intracerebral (International Classification of Diseases--Ninth Revision [ICD9] code 431) and intracranial (ICD9 code 432) hemorrhagic strokes (40-204% depending on age). In contrast, the rates of occlusion of the precerebral arteries (ICD9 code 433) declined in younger men and women but increased substantially (107%) in older men. Rates of occlusion of the cerebral arteries (ICD9 code 434) declined in men over the age of 50 years and in women aged 50-79 years. Despite the decline in the rate of occlusion of the cerebral arteries, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke appears to have increased. Changes in the hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic stroke were not accompanied by consistent decreases in the case-fatality rate. This finding tends to support the hypothesis of an actual increase in the hospitalization rate fo hemorrhagic stroke rather than an artifactually elevated rate due to enhanced diagnosis by computed tomography.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral aneurysms are hypothesized to be acquired lesions resulting from a loss of static equilibrium in the apical region of the bifurcation, which causes the opening angle of the bifurcation to change during the cardiac cycle. Repeated dynamic cycling may disrupt wall elements in a manner analogous to a wire breaking with repeated bending and result in the formation of an aneurysm. A mathematical model that predicts the geometry of arterial bifurcations is proposed. The model predicts that the transmural pressure in the smaller branch is greater than or equal to that in the larger branch and that the larger branch makes a smaller angle with the direction of the parent artery. Bifurcations with smaller area ratios (the sum of the luminal areas of the branches divided by the luminal area of the parent artery) have smaller opening angles. When the area ratio is 1.0, the opening angle is about 90 degrees. The model concludes that the opening angle is constant during the cardiac cycle if the fractional change in the radii of the daughter and parent arteries is the same for any increase in blood pressure and if the ratio of transmural pressures in the parent and daughter branches does not change during the cardiac cycle. Otherwise, the bifurcation is considered predisposed to the development of an aneurysm.\r"

During 30 minutes of ischemia produced by intracranial pressure elevation, cerebral blood flow determined by the microspheres technique was decreased to 0-1 ml/min/100 g with complete ischemia, to 1-10 ml/min/100 g with severe incomplete ischemia, or to 10-20 ml/min/100 g with moderate incomplete ischemia. During reperfusion after complete ischemia, both piglets and pigs demonstrated hyperemia but delayed hypoperfusion occurred in more brain regions in pigs, oxygen consumption returned to preischemic values in piglets but not in pigs (70 +/- 10% of preischemic values), and evoked potentials recovered better in piglets than in pigs (24 +/- 4% and 9 +/- 4% of preischemic values, respectively). Both piglets and pigs had fewer brain areas with hyperemia and hypoperfusion and improved oxygen consumption and electrical function during recovery from incomplete than from complete ischemia. We speculate that piglets tolerate complete ischemia better than pigs because of decreased reperfusion injury and that both groups recover better from incomplete than complete ischemia because of improved substrate supply during ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Using electron microscopy, we investigated the small arteries and veins in ischemic lesions induced by occlusion of the ostium of the middle cerebral artery in 42 rats. We observed endothelial denudation in the small arteries of rats receiving occlusion for greater than 6 hours. When the occluding cylinder was removed to allow for reperfusion, however, 2 hours of occlusion was sufficient for endothelial denudation to occur. Medial smooth muscle cells seemed to be more vulnerable to ischemia than endothelial cells because ultrastructural changes in the former cells preceded endothelial denudation. Moreover, endothelial denudation definitely exacerbated vascular changes so that medial necrosis appeared to be complete beneath the denuded areas, allowing erythrocytes, platelets, and exogenous tracers to penetrate into the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells. These arterial lesions seemed to be repaired 10 days after removal of the occluding cylinder following 2 hours of occlusion. On the other hand, small veins in the ischemic lesion did not show endothelial denudation or medial necrosis. Our study suggests that arterial changes in ischemic lesions play a role in exacerbating the brain edema caused by recirculation after ischemia.\r"

The animals were sacrificed with microwave radiation focused to the head immediately after a brief infusion of [14C]iodoantipyrine with rapid sampling of arterial blood. Brain tissue samples were extracted with ether to separate the tracer, which was subsequently measured by liquid scintillation counting and used to calculate local cerebral blood flow. The aqueous phase was then processed for the measurement of choline and acetylcholine concentrations by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results showed a large increase in tissue choline content and a decrease in tissue acetylcholine content during ischemia. During recirculation, choline levels progressively declined, reaching levels lower than those in four control rats after 150 minutes of recirculation for most brain regions. A reciprocal relation between the brain choline concentration and local cerebral blood flow was found. Acetylcholine levels showed an initial rebound to greater than control during recirculation, with subsequent normalization. Brain acetylcholine concentration was positively correlated with brain choline concentration, provided that cerebral blood flow was greater than 0.3 ml x g-1 x min-1. Because tissue free choline was depleted in most brain regions 150 minutes after transient ischemia, we speculate that prolonged ischemia may produce a greater depletion of tissue free choline with a resulting decline in tissue acetylcholine. This could play an important role in the cognitive deficit associated with vascular dementia.\r"

In a learning task requiring sensory-motor integration, 41 rats were trained to perform a motor response in a T-maze consequent to the detection of a vibrissal deflection cue. Once training was complete, unilateral (n = 29) or sham (n = 12) infarction was produced by a noninvasive photochemical technique. After infarction, T-maze performance was assessed repeatedly in rats receiving 2 (n = 10) or 4 (n = 10) mg/kg d-amphetamine sulfate or saline (n = 9) 24 hours prior to testing on days 4, 6, 9, and 11. The sham-operated control rats received d-amphetamine sulfate (n = 7) or no injections (n = 5). All three infarcted groups displayed a reliable and sustained behavioral deficit in performance that was not present in the sham-operated control animals. Although the performance of each infarcted group improved over the testing sessions after the first injection, the amphetamine-treated groups improved at a faster rate than the saline-injected group. The results further demonstrated a dose-response effect, with the 4 mg/kg amphetamine group recovering to within preinfarction levels 6-8 days earlier than the 2 mg/kg amphetamine and saline-injected groups. Moreover, both amphetamine-treated groups recovered more completely than the saline-injected group. Quantification of the chronic infarct area revealed no differences among the amphetamine-treated and saline-injected groups. These data provide further evidence of the facilitatory effect of d-amphetamine sulfate on recovery from brain injury and extend this effect to the enhancement of recovery subsequent to thrombotic infarction of the primary somatosensory cortex.\r"

Four groups (n = 6 each) of piglets not exposed to ischemia were studied. Enzyme administration increased plasma superoxide dismutase activity from less than 5 to 142 +/- 8 units/ml (mean +/- SEM) without increasing brain activity (e.g., activities in the caudate were 7.9 +/- 0.5 and 8.1 +/- 0.4 units/mg protein) for up to 2 hours following administration. Four additional groups (n = 5 each) of piglets were given either enzyme or polyethylene glycol 5 minutes prior to 10 minutes of global cerebral ischemia induced by aortic cross-clamping followed by either 5 or 45 minutes of reperfusion. Enzyme administration increased plasma superoxide dismutase activity from less than 5 to 144 +/- 5 units/ml but failed to increase brain activity even after 45 minutes of reperfusion (e.g., activities in the caudate were 8.5 +/- 0.3 and 8.6 +/- 0.6 units/mg protein). We conclude that intravenous polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase does not increase superoxide dismutase activity in the brain despite global ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

Xanthine oxidase has been implicated as one source of these free radicals. We examined the role of xanthine oxidase in brain injury using a cerebrospinal fluid compression model of global cerebral ischemia with 15 minutes of ischemia and 4 hours of reperfusion. Seven dogs were pretreated with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (50 mg/kg for 5 days). Neurophysiological recovery was monitored with cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. As an attempt to correlate brain recovery with the mechanism of protection, free brain malondialdehyde was measured at the end of reperfusion by high-performance liquid chromatography. Brain water content was measured by wet-dry weights. Compared with seven untreated control dogs, allopurinol pretreatment significantly improved recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials after 4 hours of reperfusion. However, the amount of free malondialdehyde in the allopurinol-treated dogs was 32% greater than that in the controls. Brain water content was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that xanthine oxidase contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, tissue damage caused by xanthine oxidase may be mediated through mechanisms other than free radical production.\r"

Hippocampal concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and glycine were monitored using in vivo microdialysis. Outcome was assessed by both neurological and neuropathologic criteria. Hypothermia afforded nearly complete protection from ischemic injury. Ischemia-induced increases in the concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and glycine in the normothermic group (3, 12, and 3 times baseline) were strikingly attenuated in the hypothermic group. In addition, the prolonged postischemic elevation of glycine levels seen in the normothermic group was absent in the hypothermic group. These results suggest that the neuroprotective properties of hypothermia may reside, in part, in their ability to prevent increases in the extracellular concentrations of amino acids that enhance the activity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the nature of ischemic striatal dopamine release during the earliest periods of neuronal injury, we used chronoamperometry to measure dopamine levels every 60 seconds during various durations of ischemia in 32 gerbils. Catecholamine-selective electrodes were implanted into the brains of anesthetized gerbils subjected to 2, 5, or 10 minutes of transient forebrain ischemia or permanent forebrain ischemia. Four control animals showed a stable chronoamperometric baseline. In the six gerbils subjected to permanent ischemia, dopamine release was rapid during early ischemia and slowed with time. The four animals subjected to 2 minutes of ischemia showed minimal dopamine release. The six gerbils subjected to 5 minutes of ischemia demonstrated a noticeable dopamine release during ischemia, and three of the six developed a massive secondary dopamine release during reperfusion. All six animals subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia demonstrated a similar biphasic dopamine release twice the size of that observed in the 5-minute group. Pretreatment with pargyline in six additional gerbils subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia failed to modify significantly this biphasic pattern of dopamine release. We conclude that dopamine release occurs very early during ischemia and that its magnitude correlates with the duration of an ischemia insult. Reperfusion is associated with an even larger striatal dopamine release. This previously unreported biphasic dopamine release phenomenon may have important clinical implications in the management of cerebral ischemia.\r"

Each subject was randomly assigned to receive placebo during one ascent and one of the active medications during the other ascent. Assessment of acute mountain sickness was performed using the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire and a clinical interview. At the summit or high point attained above base camp, the use of dexamethasone significantly reduced the incidence of acute mountain sickness and the severity of symptoms. Cerebral and respiratory symptom severity scores for subjects receiving dexamethasone (0.26 +/- 0.16 and 0.20 +/- 0.19, respectively) were significantly lower than similar scores for both acetazolamide (0.80 +/- 0.80 and 1.20 +/- 1.05; P = 0.25) and placebo (1.11 +/- 1.02 and 1.45 +/- 1.27; P = .025). Neither the use of dexamethasone nor that of acetazolamide measurably affected other physical or mental aspects. Compared with placebo, dexamethasone appears to be effective for prophylaxis of symptoms associated with acute mountain sickness accompanying rapid ascent. The precise role of dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness is not known, but it can be considered for persons without contraindications who are intolerant of acetazolamide, for whom acetazolamide is ineffective, or who must make forced, rapid ascent to high altitude for a short period of time with a guaranteed retreat route.\r"

The National Cholesterol Education Program has embarked on a campaign based on intensive medical treatment of 60 million Americans with high blood cholesterol levels, but the degree of benefit of dietary change or pharmaceutical intervention or both to reduce blood cholesterol values remains a subject of disagreement within the scientific community. Evidence from comparative international studies suggests that to lower coronary heart disease mortality substantially, dietary alterations and general societal changes must be greater than those possible under the National Cholesterol Education Program's approach of physician-centered patient counseling. The nation's priority to prevent coronary heart disease should be a public policy approach, the goal of which is to reduce for the entire population all coronary disease risk factors. In the dietary area, three proposals to reduce the availability of atherogenic foods are the use of warning labels on atherogenic foods, the prohibition of advertising for such high-risk foods, and the imposition of an excise tax on the same foods. We must confront the \"TV-auto-supermarket society\" that underlies our nation's high rate of coronary heart disease.\r"

Plasma concentrations observed in the low-dose group (2.1 mg/kg) were below the assay's limit of detection and were not included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained in the medium-dose (4.2 mg/kg) and high-dose (8.4 mg/kg) groups, respectively: peak plasma concentration 4.25 +/- 0.26 and 7.81 +/- 0.31 micrograms/mL; area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 19.79 +/- 2.96 and 39.81 +/- 7.05 h.micrograms/mL; elimination rate constant of the beta phase 0.105 +/- 0.77 and 0.093 +/- 0.009 h(-1), and half-life 8.85 +/- 4.61 and 7.51 +/- 0.69 h. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased by 10, 11, and 16 percent in the low-, medium-, and high-dose groups, respectively. Heart rate was not altered during the low-dose infusion. At the medium- and high-dose levels, resting peak heart rate increased by 18 and 27 percent, respectively. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not significantly changed in any of the dose groups. Changes in electrocardiographic intervals for the three dose groups were not significant except at the highest dose where an average 20 percent increase in the QRS interval was seen. Mild subjective adverse effects (dizziness, taste perversion, and circumoral paresthesia) which did not necessitate discontinuing the infusion occurred in the highest dosage group. Further studies are warranted to more fully characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and therapeutic potential of actisomide.\r"

After a six-day washout period, subjects were crossed over to the opposite four-day double-blind treatment. Following an additional six-day washout period, subjects received indomethacin placebo and PPA placebo during a final, single-blind four-day period. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring every 30 minutes and a 24-hour urine collection for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were performed on the fourth day of each treatment period. Compliance with the medication regimen was confirmed by drug concentrations, pill counts, and urinary PGE2 concentrations. Compared with the indomethacin and placebo treatment periods, the combination of indomethacin and PPA had no significant effect on mean systolic or diastolic BP during the 24-hour study period or during any four-hour interval. We conclude that the combination of SR PPA 75 mg/d and SR indomethacin 150 mg/d for four days has no adverse effect on BP in normotensive women.\r"

To determine the effectiveness of this targeted educational intervention in reducing inappropriate use and associated drug costs, albumin prescribing for all adult inpatients at University Hospital over a 30-day period was assessed in a retrospective review. Eighty-six patients used a total of 843 units, a ten percent reduction in total albumin use. Albumin administration to thoracic surgery patients decreased by 38 percent. The 35 percent reduction in inappropriate albumin use by this service (Fisher's exact test, p less than 0.001) was associated with an estimated annual cost savings of +83,500. Inappropriate albumin use by other medical services generally increased over previously measured levels. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions in reducing inappropriate albumin use and thereby controlling rising healthcare costs.\r"

Phase 1 of the study was a retrospective audit of 50 randomly selected adult patients receiving i.v. ranitidine. The chart was reviewed for indications for therapy, rationale for i.v. ranitidine, median length of i.v. therapy, and appropriateness of i.v. use. Phase 2 consisted of concurrent monitoring of iv ranitidine solely to assess the appropriateness of the iv dosage form at our hospital. Staff pharmacists reviewed the patient's medication profile from the central pharmacy to determine if the patient had standing orders for any oral or nasogastric medications while concomitantly receiving iv ranitidine. An educational memo was placed in the patient's chart if the patient was concurrently receiving oral or nasogastric medications and i.v. ranitidine. In phase I, i.v. ranitidine was inappropriate either partially or totally in 51 percent of the cases. The median length of inappropriate i.v. therapy was five days. During the second phase, the pharmacy staff reviewed 4301 profiles of patients receiving i.v. ranitidine over eight months. Educational memos were placed in 451 patient charts (11 percent) where conversion from i.v. to oral therapy was feasible; a favorable follow-up occurred in 275 cases (61 percent). This would result in an estimated annual cost savings of $4,685. Based on our ranitidine use review, extrapolating the median length of inappropriate i.v. therapy to five days would result in a yearly cost savings of $23,425. This project demonstrated that staff pharmacists can impact on physician education and cost savings by routinely screening patient's medication profiles from the central pharmacy.\r"

  ".W": "Simvastatin, a chemical derivative of lovastatin, is an antihyperlipidemic medication that inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Animal and clinical data suggest simvastatin is twice as potent as lovastatin. It lowers serum cholesterol by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of cholesterol and, more importantly, by increasing the number of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors present on hepatic cellular membranes. Simvastatin, when used at doses of 40 mg/d in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, significantly reduces total cholesterol (greater than 30 percent) and LDL cholesterol (35-45 percent) and tends to reduce triglycerides and raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The agent is also effective in patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, and nephrotic syndrome. Addition of cholestyramine to simvastatin enhances the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect to approximately 55 percent. Common clinical adverse effects reported with simvastatin use include headaches and gastrointestinal complaints. Transient elevations in serum transaminases and creatine phosphokinase have also been seen. Based on data currently available, the drug's clinical activity and adverse-effect profile are similar to those of lovastatin. Therefore, there is no need for formularies to contain both medications. To choose between the two, one needs to consider the incidence of adverse effects and the daily cost of each product when used at equally effective doses. That information is now now available and, until it is, a clear recommendation cannot be made. Simvastatin, presently marketed in several countries, is investigational in the U.S. but is expected to be available soon.\r"

The model simulated the intubated neonate and examined the effect of changes in a variety of parameters commonly confronted in the clinical setting. Theophylline was nebulized for 15 minutes and captured in an artificial lung system (a 1000-mL intravenous bag). Variables were: peak pressure (20, 24, 28 cm H2O), ventilator rate (40, 60, 80 breaths/min), nebulizer flow rate (5, 7, 10 L/min), endotracheal tube size (2.5, 3.0, 3.5 mm), and ventilator type (Servo 900C, Bourns BP 200, Bear Cub BP 2001). The amount of drug actually captured in the bag ranged from 0.009 to 12.59 percent (mean 2.08). A multivariate analysis showed that only nebulizer flow rate had a statistically significant effect on drug delivery with 10 L/min delivering the most drug. All factors combined only accounted for 11.5 percent of the variability in drug delivery. In light of the wide and unpredictable amounts of drug delivered through ventilators, dosing to pharmacologic effect rather than staying within narrow dosing guidelines may be more rational in patients responding poorly to standard doses.\r"

  ".W": "The disposition of drugs in the elderly is particularly relevant with antiinfectives, because this population has an increased risk of infections. Renal function deteriorates with age, yet dosage guidelines for antibiotics that allow for this reduction remain to be established. Ceftazidime, a cephalosporin with enhanced antipseudomonal activity that is eliminated primarily by glomerular filtration, has been evaluated in the elderly. Herein, we review ceftazidime's pharmacokinetic profile and dosing considerations in this population. Several aspects of renal function deteriorate with the normal aging process, including a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Using serum creatinine concentrations as an estimate of the GFR in the elderly is unreliable; a more reliable way of estimating GFR is the use of inulin or 51Cr-editic acid clearance or calculation from formulas or nomograms based on age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine. From pharmacokinetic studies it was found that the elderly individual without renal disease generally has an increased elimination half-life and decreased clearance of ceftazidime compared with a young person. A positive correlation (r = 0.7-0.95) was shown between ceftazidime clearance and GFR, suggesting that estimates of GFR may be used to determine the ceftazidime dose. In several studies, the trough (after 12 hours) ceftazidime serum concentration exceeded by several fold its minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 90% of organisms for most commonly encountered organisms; efficacy and safety were also confirmed with an every-12-hour regimen. A twice-daily dosage regimen for ceftazidime in elderly patients with normal renal function should be considered based on age-related decreases in renal function and drug elimination.\r"

The results of a multiple linear regression showed that the prescribed daily dose was significantly lower in women, the elderly, and those with a shorter (one to six year) psychiatric history. In contrast, being an inpatient in psychiatric wards in general and public mental hospitals was significantly associated with a higher dose; marital status, education, and diagnosis were not. The number and potency (low to moderate vs. high) of the prescribed NLs were also significantly associated with the prescribed dose, and an interaction was found between the two. Implications of these findings for improvement in NL prescription patterns are discussed.\r"

Shortages of personnel, equipment, and drugs continue to be a problem. Challenges facing the pharmacy profession include improving drug supply, promoting rational use of essential drugs, and educating healthcare professionals and the public. Persuading pharmacists to practice in the government sector of healthcare rather than to serve the small percentage of the public that can afford private healthcare should be a major priority. Zimbabwe is a land of opportunity for pharmacy practice but the financial constraints are formidable.\r"

The four areas specifically investigated were 1) Personal Attributes, 2) Attitudes toward the Practice of Medicine, 3) Basic Psychosocial Skills of interviewing and assessment, and 4) Complex Psychosocial Skills, including counseling and brief psychological intervention. A total of 17 male and 9 female residents participated sequentially in 4-6 consecutive weeks of a specially designed behavioral science curriculum. Results demonstrated change in the positive direction in only two of the four areas, Personal Attributes (p. less than .05), and Psychosocial Assessment Skills (p. less than 000). Findings suggest that certain basic psychosocial assessment skills, especially those in which residents initially evaluate themselves as lacking mastery, can be successfully taught through a structured format. However, overall lack of clinically relevant improvement points to significant limitations in using structured coursework to address issues of values and attitudinal change. Further, such a structured approach does not seem to have been effective in teaching the skills requiring actual patient intervention.\r"

For this research investigators must measure family system variables with instruments that are both valid and reliable. In this context, eight self-report measures of total family functioning are reviewed and assessed according to a standardized approach to instrument design. The instruments evaluated include the Family Assessment Device, the Family Assessment Measure, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales, the Family Environment Scale, the Family Functioning Index, the Self-Report Family Inventory, the Family APGAR, and the Family Functioning Questionnaire. The analysis indicates two major problems with these instruments. First, there is disagreement on key concepts and definitions. Second, there is inconsistency in design and attention to detail in empirical analysis and psychometic evaluation. Family assessment techniques need further development and remain a fertile research field for family medicine investigation.\r"

Demographic characteristics, functional status, stressful life changes, social supports, and self-esteem were assessed at baseline by a self-administered questionnaire. Hospital days, bed-disability days, restricted-activity days, and physician visits were then measured prospectively by mailed questionnaire over the next 6 months. There were no cross-sectional associations of psychosocial variables with demographic characteristics. Better functional status (measured by the Sickness Impact Profile) was associated with a lower 12-month life-change score (measured by the Social Readjustment Rating Scale), with stronger social supports (measured by a 13-item index), and with higher self-esteem (measured by the Rosenberg Scale). On bivariate analysis, higher life-change score predicted higher levels of all four morbidity variables; low social supports predicted increased bed days, restricted-activity days, and physician visits; and low self-esteem predicted high restricted-activity. After controlling for demographic characteristics and baseline function by multivariate analysis, low social supports continued to predict higher rates of physician visits, but the other associations of psychosocial variables with morbidity were no longer statistically significant. The results suggest that patients with weak social supports have increased use of physician services.\r"

The mean number of searches per faculty user was 6.4 and the median number of documents found per search was 15. The users were moderately satisfied with the search process (2.4 on a scale of 1 as excellent to 5 as unusable). Search strategies tended to be unsophisticated, often using only one of several possible related search terms. Most searches took a limited amount of time (5 to 20 minutes). The program was sufficiently successful to warrant continuation. Computerized literature searching offers a method to meet the physicians' needs for ready access to information on patient-related questions.\r"

Data from 32 respondents to a mental health questionnaire who met criteria for phobic avoidance were analyzed. Only 28% indicated that they had seen a physician about their fears. The presence of panic attacks and duration of fears and avoidance were key factors in patients' decision to present. In those patients with both panic attacks and phobic avoidance, fear-of-dying and urgency of presentation for panic attacks were particularly important in the decision to present for their fears. These findings are relevant to both primary care and emergency room physicians, indicating the need to raise physician sensitivity to this problem. Future studies with larger samples are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Part II of this series examines two compounds that are or have been in use in countries other than the United States. Mifepristone (RU486) is the first of the clinically useful progesterone antagonists; it competes with progesterone for receptors in the uterus, ovary, and pituitary gland. When taken by women in the follicular phase, it might be capable of inhibiting folliculogenesis while still allowing endometrial proliferation for normal menstrual cycling. When the drug is taken in the late luteal phase, endometrial shedding can usually be induced even after nidation. Mifepristone could thus serve as an emergency postcoital agent. In principle, it could also be used as a monthly emmenagogue, but clinical trials have been unsuccessful due to disruption of the following cycle's length. Shorter-acting antiprogesterones now under development may overcome this difficulty. Political constraints ultimately may be more limiting than pharmacological ones. Gossypol is a Chinese cottonseed derivative, which, taken orally, inhibits spermatogenesis in men. Its efficacy is very high, but use is presently limited by two adverse effects: occasional symptomatic hypokalemia and a 10 percent chance of irreversibility of aspermia. Current research is directed at understanding and overcoming these obstacles.\r"

Though temporal arteritis can occur with a normal ESR, this is not generally appreciated in primary care. The case reported here is a 74-year-old woman with biopsy-proven temporal arteritis; her ESR was 22 mm/hr. Of note, her hematocrit was more than 40 percent, a condition previously reported to be associated with temporal arteritis and a normal ESR. This discussion focuses on the diagnosis of temporal arteritis and its associated symptoms.\r"

  ".U": "91228867\r", 
  ".W": "We performed a retrospective review of screening parasitology examinations on a Cambodian refugee population served by an urban neighborhood health center. Five-hundred twenty of 1084 patients were examined for ova and parasites either by purged stool, which was examined immediately, or preserved stool, examined at a teaching hospital and proprietary laboratories. Overall, 335 (64 percent) of the tested patients had at least one parasite. The prevalence of infection varied by test technique (purged stool examined immediately, 86 percent; preserved stool examined at a hospital, 65 percent; preserved stool sent to a proprietary laboratory, 31 percent, P less than 0.01). In this population where Entamoeba histolytica infection was 44 percent as measured by the purged warm stool technique, the cold preserved stool test had a measured relative sensitivity of 33 percent. Assuming a selectivity of 99 percent, it would take eight negative tests to reach a greater than 95 percent negative predictive value. The high rate of intestinal carriage of pathogenic parasites in this population and the insensitivity of commonly available diagnostic tests make routine presumptive treatment of intestinal parasites an option when the purged stool examination is unavailable.\r"

Duplicate throat swabs were obtained for each child, and latex agglutination was performed within 15 minutes. In children with negative latex agglutination results, the second swab was cultured. All latex agglutination results were available within 20 minutes of collection, while the patients waited in the office. Seven hundred thirty-eight specimens were positive by latex agglutination. Seventy-eight of the 1663 latex negative specimens contained group A streptococci on culture (sensitivity 90 percent). Approximately 60 percent of these latex-negative, culture-positive specimens demonstrated 3(+)-4+ growth in culture, unlike previous studies ascribing false-negative latex results to low colony count specimens. Fifty percent of bacitracin-susceptible streptococci tested were not group A, indicating a relatively high occurrence of nongroup A beta-hemolytic streptococcal carriage in this patient population. The use of latex agglutination for detection of group A streptococcal pharyngitis was well-suited to our office practice, even during an extremely busy winter season. Although this assay appears to have a relatively high sensitivity, it is still prudent to culture latex-negative swabs to exclude group A streptococcal infection. The significance of nongroup A beta-hemolytic streptococci in our patient population was unclear. Further refinements are necessary.\r"

However, epidural analgesia seemed to provide a protective neonatal effect when oxytocin was used during labor. Both elective and medically necessary use of these interventions were associated with increased morbidity. If obstetrical interventions, particularly oxytocin and epidural analgesia, are applied in low-risk pregnancies, labors must be monitored carefully and the risk-benefit ratios judged advantageous.\r"

Thirteen smokers entered an open clinical trial. Smokers were titrated to 30 mg/day of oral buspirone for 2 weeks prior to cessation. Tobacco withdrawal and Spielberger state-anxiety scales were used at baseline, on the quit date, and then at 24 hours, 48 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after abrupt cessation. At the final visit, smokers compared their withdrawal experience with previous cessation attempts. Two patients (15 percent) could not tolerate the medication and did not attempt smoking cessation. Of the remaining 11 smokers, 3 (27 percent) rated withdrawal relief \"very definite,\" 6 (55 percent) \"moderate,\" and 2 (18 percent) \"slight.\" More than two-thirds of the smokers believed that their difficulty concentrating, craving, restlessness, and anxiety were improved compared with earlier tobacco withdrawal attempts. Five patients (46 percent) reported decreased smoking urges during the 2-week medication titration period. Tobacco withdrawal symptoms and state-anxiety scores changed significantly during the study (P less than 0.05). These results are encouraging, but they should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and lack of placebo control. Buspirone effect on tobacco withdrawal symptoms should be studied in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.\r"

These examinations are especially problematic for community-based primary care providers unaccustomed to standards used by physicians in occupational settings. In response to a mailed questionnaire, 255 family physicians and general practitioners described their current methods of performing these examinations. Forty percent reported that employers routinely provide no information about the job for which the prospective employee is being evaluated. Respondents differed according to number and type of laboratory tests routinely included as part of a preemployment evaluation and in the proportion of prospective employees disqualified on the basis of the examination. Twenty-four percent reported no disqualifications, and 34 percent disqualified 5 percent or more. The percentage reporting medical and psychological information also varied. One-half routinely reported alcohol and drug abuse to employers, and of these, only one-half obtained a waiver for the release of such information. Five of every 6 physicians believed that it was more important to \"tell the truth to the employer\" than to \"protect the interests of the employee.\" Our findings show that no consensus exists among the primary care physicians in our survey about the performance of preemployment evaluations. Because this can have serious consequences to workers, employers, and physicians, we propose guidelines for primary care physicians who perform preemployment evaluations.\r"

The very slow (microns/sec) random translational motion of water protons in various brain tissues and intracranial fluid compartments can now be assessed with MR diffusion imaging. More slowly diffusing protons in ischemic tissues can be differentiated from normal parenchyma, CSF, and flowing blood, enabling the detection and localization of ischemic regions within minutes of the onset of stroke. Perfusion imaging \"snapshots,\" obtained in as little as 25 msec with echoplanar MR methods, permit the evaluation of tissue washin/washout kinetics of contrast agents in the microvasculature, and thus the quantification of brain perfusion on a regional basis. Also, delineation of major intra- and extracranial arterial and venous structures with MR angiography, acquired with two- or three-dimensional Fourier transformation techniques, has enabled accurate noninvasive assessments of vascular occlusive disease. Finally, improvements in MR spectroscopic techniques have facilitated investigations of metabolic regulation and bioenergetics in experimental animal models of cerebral ischemia, as well as in stroke patients. Combined MR imaging and spectroscopy will likely play an important role in differentiating reversibly from irreversibly ischemic brain tissues and in the investigation of various neuroprotective pharmaceuticals.\r"

Fourteen patients with complicated bacterial endocarditis underwent ECG-gated spin-echo cardiac MR imaging in addition to conventional duplex two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo). Angiography was performed in seven patients, six of whom underwent surgery for valve replacement. MR imaging detected the pseudoaneurysms in all five of the surgically proved cases, while 2-D echo detected only three. Clinical follow-up suggested there were no false-negative examinations, but no autopsy data were available for confirmation. Postoperative MR imaging studies were conducted in three patients, revealing two recurrent pseudoaneurysms and one thrombosed aneurysm. Cardiac MR imaging provides useful pre- and postoperative information in patients with perivalvular pseudoaneurysms due to endocarditis.\r"

Persistent high fevers, despite antibiotic therapy, were present in all patients, with elevated WBC count in 18 patients, vague abdominal tenderness in 11, and septic shock requiring vasopressors in 15. Sonographically, all patients had distended, spherical gallbladders, six had gallstones, eight had wall thickening, three had pericholecystic fluid, and four had Murphy's sign. All patients were seen by a senior abdominal surgeon, who agreed to a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Fourteen patients (58%) responded to percutaneous cholecystostomy, as evidenced by a decrease in WBC count, defervescence, and the ability to be weaned off vasopressors. Bile cultures were positive in four patients. Ten patients (42%) did not respond to percutaneous cholecystostomy; five eventually died of unrelated causes. A respiratory source of infection was eventually found in three of these 10 patients, with no proved source of infection in the remainder. No complications related to catheter insertion occurred in this group of patients. Bile leaks occurred in two patients when the percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter was removed, but without serious consequence. Our experience suggests that a lower threshold for performing percutaneous cholecystostomy in this difficult clinical subset of patients is worthwhile.\r"

The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days. The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients. CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients. Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients. CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%). Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess. In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen MR studies performed in four patients who had undergone combined pancreatic and renal transplantation were reviewed retrospectively to determine if dynamic gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced gradient-echo imaging is useful in the early diagnosis of pancreatic transplant rejection. The MR studies were performed between 3 days and 6 months after transplantation and consisted of T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images as well as a gradient-echo image prior to administration of an IV bolus of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg). After injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, a static dynamic gradient-echo scan was obtained. Signal-intensity measurements were determined for each of the gradient-echo images and used to generate an enhancement curve. Because T2 values have previously been used as an objective indicator of rejection, the mean T2 of each pancreatic transplant was calculated also. The MR results were compared with clinical and laboratory data and/or percutaneous biopsy results. In six studies of normally functioning pancreatic allografts, the percent enhancement during the first minute of the enhancement curve was 98 +/- 23% (1 SD). In six episodes of acute dysfunction (rejection or infarction), the first-minute enhancement was 42 +/- 20%. In four cases of dysfunction, the finding of an abnormal enhancement curve preceded a significant drop in urinary amylase by 1-4 days. The calculated T2 value was prolonged in only two cases in which biopsy-proved pancreatic infarction had occurred. No prolongation of T2 was evident in four cases of rejection alone. These results suggest that mean T2 calculation at 1.5 T may not be a reliable indicator of pancreatic transplant rejection, but that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced gradient-echo MR imaging of the pancreatic transplant may be a reliable early indicator of pancreatic transplant dysfunction.\r"

A majority of these patients have a functional abnormality of the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal stage of swallowing. However, what constitutes normalcy is not well understood, and baseline swallowing in elderly persons without dysphagia has not been adequately described. We therefore evaluated 56 persons with a mean age of 83 years who had no symptoms of dysphagia or eating difficulty. Videofluoroscopy and radiographs with the subject erect and recumbent were obtained. Normal deglutition, as defined in young persons, was present in only 16%. Oral abnormalities (difficulty ingesting, controlling, and delivering bolus relative to swallowing initiation) were seen in 63%. Pharyngeal dysfunction (bolus retention and lingual propulsion or pharyngeal constrictor paresis) was seen in 25%. Pharyngoesophageal segment abnormalities were observed in 39% (mostly cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction). Esophageal abnormalities (mostly motor in nature) were observed in 36%. What has been described as swallowing dysfunction in young persons may not be abnormal in very elderly persons. It is difficult to distinguish the effect of normal aging from the effects of specific diseases or gradual degenerative changes.\r"

  ".W": "The depth of tumor invasion measured at histologic examination is the most important prognostic factor in early-stage carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The ability of MR to estimate the depth of tumor invasion was studied in 47 patients who subsequently underwent radical hysterectomy. In two patients, MR failed to detect tumors with infiltration depths of 2 and 4 mm. The maximum sagittal tumor length along the axis of the cervix (D) and the maximum tumor area on sagittal (S) and axial (A) images were measured with MR. The depth of tumor infiltration determined histologically (I) correlated with the degree of infiltration noted on MR images. The univariate correlation coefficients for log I vs log D, log S, and log A were .87, .84, and .77, respectively. By stepwise inclusion of the variables in a multivariate analysis, the contributions to the coefficient of determination from including log S and log A after log D were less than 1%. The regression analysis showed that the best estimate for the depth of invasion was close to half of the sagittal tumor length measured on MR, I = D/2. Our experience shows that MR is valuable in determining the degree of invasiveness in clinical stage I tumors.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, radiologic, and histologic features of 22 cases of Paget sarcoma were reviewed to determine in which patients with Paget disease these tumors are most likely to develop and what radiologic findings suggest the diagnosis. Clinical findings at presentation included pain and/or a mass (11 patients), pathologic fracture (seven), and neurologic symptoms (four). Survival time in 20 patients ranged from 5 days to 2.5 years. Two patients were lost to follow-up: one at 2 years and one at 8 years. There were 16 high-grade osteosarcomas, three chondrosarcomas, two fibrosarcomas, and one malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The most common site was the femur. Tumors also were observed in unusual sites. In one case of multifocal osteosarcoma, the tumor involved only pagetic bone. In 15 patients, Paget disease was polyostotic, clinically significant, and had been documented previously. In four patients, a sarcoma developed near the site of a fracture that had occurred between 2 months and 15 years previously. All cases showed radiologic evidence of a destructive lesion; other findings included a mass and evidence of tumor mineralization. Periosteal reaction was not observed. All but one tumor developed in a site of osteoblastic or mixed osteoblastic and lytic Paget disease. Our results suggest that sarcomas can develop in any part of any bone affected by Paget disease but are more likely to occur with advanced disease and to present with a destructive lesion without periosteal reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Spirometric measurement of lung volume in an infant or uncooperative child is often a difficult and time-consuming procedure. Previous investigators have successfully estimated total lung capacity in adults and older children by using chest radiography. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of functional residual capacity (FRC) determination from chest radiographs in an animal model of the normal neonatal chest. FRC was determined with the helium dilution (HeD) method in 13 anesthetized, intubated, and paralyzed rabbits (weight range, 1.5-3.9 kg). FRC was then estimated from digital frontal and lateral chest radiographs. The radiographic estimate was made by applying measurements taken from the radiographic film pair to a geometric model of the chest. The best-fit model assumed an elliptical cross section for the intrathoracic cavity, heart, paraspinal structures, and diaphragm in the axial plane. Linear regression on independently determined HeD and radiographically determined FRC yielded a slope of 1.02 (p less than .001), an intercept of -3.02 cm3 (p = .565), and a correlation coefficient of 0.96 (p less than .001). We conclude that radiographic FRC estimates closely approximate HeD estimates in a rabbit model of the normal neonatal chest.\r"

The diagnosis of lambdoid synostosis was based on other plain film findings, CT findings, or clinical examination. All patients had deformity of the ipsilateral petrous bone, presumably because of pressure caused by redirected brain growth. Specific changes included flattening of the petrous ridge and depression of the roof of the mastoid portion of the petrous bone and adjacent structures such as the semicircular canals. Flattening of the petrous ridge and depression of the roof of the mastoid portion of the petrous bone are useful signs of lambdoid synostosis when sutural closure has produced sutural indistinctness rather than sclerosis.\r"

Clinical findings were lower limb claudication (all patients), impotence (eight patients), and blue-toe syndrome (two patients). The underlying disease was atherosclerosis in 24 patients and nonspecific aortoarteritis in three patients. Dilatation was successful in all patients. Embolic occlusions of the left common iliac artery (one patient) and left superficial femoral artery (one patient) were the only major complications. Claudication in the affected limb continued in the first patient; the second died when diagnostic angiography, performed 3 months after angioplasty, caused a severe atheroembolus. Of the other 25 patients, nine of the 10 followed up for 13-48 months and all seven followed up for 3-8 months were free of symptoms. Six of eight patients with sexual dysfunction had normal function after angioplasty. Seven patients still awaited follow-up and one was lost to follow-up. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is an effective treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta.\r"
