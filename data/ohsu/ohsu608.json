Each of the three anesthetics caused a dose-dependent reversible decrease in contractility. The onset of maximal myofibrillar activation was delayed in a dose-dependent manner, and time to peak shortening of the isotonic preloaded twitch was unchanged, except for a slight decrease at greater than 1 MAC of enflurane. Isoflurane's negative inotropic effects were clearly less than those of either halothane or enflurane. Comparison of the time course of contraction and relaxation in both isometric and isotonic twitches suggests that, in addition to effects on intracellular calcium availability, these anesthetics decrease the myofibrillar responsiveness to calcium and/or the calcium sensitivity of the contractile proteins.\r"

Load sensitivity of relaxation was quantified by comparing force and time coordinates at the onset of the isometric relaxation phase in several afterloaded isotonic twitch contractions with relaxation of the isometric twitch. Load sensitivity of relaxation, which is of particular benefit during early rapid filling of the heart, was decreased in a dose-dependent reversible fashion by halothane, enflurane, and, to a lesser extent, by isoflurane. These anesthetics abbreviated isometric relaxation, yet prolonged the time course of muscle lengthening which is suggestive of an impairment of calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and of a decrease in calcium sensitivity of the contractile proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of doxacurium chloride, a new long-acting neuromuscular blocking agent, during a stable state of nitrous oxide and narcotic anesthesia. Ninety-three ASA physical status I or II patients were studied after informed written consent had been obtained. Eighty-one patients (group A) received doxacurium. The 81 patients were divided into nine subgroups according to the dose of doxacurium administered (0.01-0.06 mg.kg-1). Patients in a control group (group B) (n = 12) received pancuronium. To assess neuromuscular responses, a force displacement transducer recorded the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle following ulnar nerve stimulation. The ED50 and ED95 for doxacurium were estimated to be 0.013 mg.kg-1 and 0.023 mg.kg-1, respectively. The time to maximum twitch suppression following a dose of 1.0 (ED95) and 1.7 (ED95) was 10.3 +/- 1.3 min and 7.6 +/- 0.8 min, respectively. After an ED95 dose of doxacurium the time to spontaneous recovery to 95% of control twitch height was 73.7 +/- 8.7 min. With larger doses of doxacurium, 0.04 mg.kg-1 (1.7 X ED95) and 0.05 mg.kg-1 (2.2 X ED95), the time to spontaneous recovery to 95% of control twitch height was 125.8 +/- 24.8 and 204.0 +/- 21.2 minutes, respectively. When 25% twitch height recovery or more was present the reversal of doxacurium induced neuromuscular blockade was prompt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of bolus doses of doxacurium ranging from 10 to 80 micrograms/kg were studied in 81 consenting ASA physical status I and II patients anesthetized with nitrous oxide-oxygen-fentanyl-thiopental. The neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of doxacurium were compared with those of eight patients receiving 100 micrograms/kg of pancuronium receiving identical anesthesia. The calculated ED95 for evoked twitch inhibition of the adductor pollicis at 0.15 Hz was 30 micrograms/kg. At 1.3 times the ED95 dose of doxacurium, recovery times to 5% and 25% of control twitch height were 59.2 +/- 4.1 (n = 23 of 26) and 75.7 +/- 5.6 (n = 23 of 26) min respectively. For pancuronium comparable recovery times were 81.7 +/- 10.3 (n = 8 of 8) and 83.0 +/- 8.4 (n = 5 of 8) min. Residual doxacurium blockade was readily antagonized by neostigmine. No dose-related effect on heart rate or mean arterial pressure was seen with doxacurium at doses up to and including 2.7 times the ED95 (80 micrograms/kg). Doxacurium administration did not result in any elevation of plasma histamine at doses up to and including 2.7 times the ED95. In this study doxacurium appears to be a long-acting nondepolarizing relaxant with readily reversible neuromuscular blocking effects and devoid of cardiovascular effects. This profile offers clinical advantages over current long-acting agents and further clinical trials seem appropriate.\r"

In addition, the rate of change of the hepatic content of these two compounds was calculated by serially subtracting the amount of the compound and the metabolites in the bile and in the perfusate from the dose of drug added to the perfusate. It was found that, whereas the concentration of pancuronium in the perfusate declined slowly and monoexponentially, vercuronium concentration in the perfusate declined rapidly in a biexponential manner. No metabolites of either drug were detected in the perfusate. Approximately 40% of the injected dose of vecuronium was excreted in the bile as unchanged vecuronium and another 30% as the 3-hydroxy metabolite. No other metabolites of vecuronium were found in the bile. In total only about 7% of pancuronium (unchanged) was collected in the bile by the end of the experiment. It is concluded that, in comparison to pancuronium, the rat liver takes up large amounts of vecuronium rapidly, half of which is eliminated as unchanged vecuronium and half as the 3-hydroxy derivative. A small amount of vecuronium or its 3-hydroxy metabolite is returned to the perfusate from the liver. Some possible mechanisms underlying these differences are discussed.\r"

Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), cerebrospinal fluid pressure (Pcsf), and sagittal sinus pressure (Pss) were measured. CPP of 83, 63, 53, 43, 33, and 23 mmHg were studied in three groups of animals. In group 1 (n = 6, isoflurane 1.4%) CPP was decreased by hemorrhage, in group 2 (n = 6, isoflurane 1.4%) CPP was decreased by increasing Pcsf while MABP was maintained constant, and in group 3 (n = 6; isoflurane 2.8%) CPP was decreased by hemorrhage. Control total CBF in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 69 +/- 8, 72 +/- 7, and 150 +/- 25 ml.min-1.100 g-1, respectively, at CPP of 84 +/- 1 mmHg. Flow to both cerebral hemispheres and brain stem in animals receiving 2.8% isoflurane was approximately twice that found with 1.4% isoflurane while CMRO2 was similar (about 3.5 ml.min-1.100 g-1). In groups 1 and 2 flow in all brain areas was maintained as CPP decreased to 43 mmHg and then flow decreased as CPP decreased further (P less than 0.05). In group 3 flow to all brain areas decreased progressively as CPP decreased from 83 to 23 mmHg. At CPP of 43 mmHg and below, flow to cerebrum was similar in the three groups; however, flow to brain stem in group 3 animals remained elevated above groups 1 and 2 until CPP was decreased to 23 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They appear to act primarily on the chemical transmission process itself without affecting the conduction of impulses in nerve axons. The objective of the present study was to directly examine the effects of halothane on the release of acetylcholine and overall ganglionic transmission. The effects of halothane on ganglionic transmission were studied in the stellate ganglion of the cat in vitro. The preganglionic nerves of the stellate ganglion were stimulated electrically to generate threshold and suprathreshold evoked potentials in the postganglionic nerves. The picomole levels of released acetylcholine in the superfusate were determined with a radioenzymatic method using 32P-ATP following a 5-min preganglionic stimulation before and after the addition of 0.28 and 0.59 mM halothane (vaporizer settings of 1% and 2%, respectively). Halothane at both concentrations: 1) depressed sympathetic ganglionic transmission induced by either threshold or suprathreshold stimulation of the preganglionic nerves; and 2) caused a dose-dependent decrease in acetylcholine release during threshold stimulation with no change in neurotransmitter release during suprathreshold stimulation. In summary, the interruption of synaptic transmission by halothane involves at least two mechanisms: 1) decrease in acetylcholine release during low level of synaptic transmission; and 2) postsynaptic decrease in sensitivity to acetylcholine during low and high levels of synaptic transmission.\r"

Psychologic status was assessed by the Sickness Impact Profile, the SCL-90-R, and a Metamemory Questionnaire. Cognitive functioning was measured by a battery of ten psychomotor, memory, and skilled performance tasks. Physical health was scored by the ASA classification of physical status, a health index, postoperative complications ratings, and a self-rated measure of the patient's health. There were cognitive differences across surgery groups due to age and gender variability among the patients; however, the type of anesthesia produced no difference in behavior. Both the physical and mental health indices showed improvement from the preoperative to the postoperative periods. General anesthesia appears to pose no risk to mental function and recovery beyond that associated with regional anesthesia and surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Left sided hemodynamic events during respiration remain a controversial subject. Left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic events were evaluated during obstructed and partially obstructed inspiration in anesthetized dogs acutely instrumented with mitral (Qm) and ascending aortic (Qa) flow probes. This allows classification of the inspiratory decrease in LV stroke volume as either a diastolic event (e.g., ventricular interdependence) in which case the LV inflow volume (integral of Qm) should decrease before the LV outflow volume (integral of Qa), or a systolic event (e.g., afterload or contractility) in which case outflow (integral of QA) should decrease before inflow (integral of Qm). During either unobstructed (n =8) or partially obstructed (n = 5 spontaneous ventilation, Qm reached both its inspiratory minimum and expiratory maximum prior to the associated minimum and maximum values for integral of in 80% or more of the respiratory cycles. Thus, a diastolic event dominates both in reducing the subsequent LV outflow during the expiratory increase in intrathoracic pressure. However, because a diastolic event did not occur first at all times, a systolic event must occur first at all times, a systolic event must also be present. If a rapid change in intrathoracic pressure occurred during diastole, integral of Qm invariably immediately increased. If a rapid in intrathoracic pressure occurred during systole, integral of Qa could change independently of the preceding integral of Qm. Both systolic and diastolic mechanisms contribute to the inspiratory fall in LV output. These mechanisms will not be clearly delineated without evaluating the effects of intrathoracic pressure within a single cardiac cycle.\r"

Results were compared within and between groups and to previously reported normal values for Vf (0.030-0.054 ml/min) and Ra (220-240 cmH2O.ml-1.min) in dogs. At the two lower doses of thiopental, midazolam, or etomidate Vf was not significantly different than previously reported normal values. At the two higher doses of each drug Vf was 0.019-0.024 ml/min, significantly reduced compared to Vf at the two lower doses of each drug. The pattern of Ra data was more varied. With thiopental Ra was elevated at the lowest dose, (354 +/- 17 cmH2O.ml-1.min, mean +/- SD) reduced at the highest dose (156 +/- 19 cmH2O.ml-1.min), and not significantly different than previously reported normal values at the two intermediate doses. With midazolam Ra was elevated at the lowest and highest doses (332 +/- 25 and 378 +/- 18 cmH2O.ml-1.min) and normal at the two intermediate doses. With etomidate Ra was normal at the three lower doses and reduced at the highest dose (187 +/- 13 cmH2O.ml-1.min). It is concluded that CSF volume may be increased and the CSF pressure at which CSF volume contracts may be increased by doses of thiopental or midazolam that increase Ra, but not increased by etomidate.\r"

  ".U": "89024017\r", 
  ".W": "Twenty-eight adult patients anesthetized with fentanyl, then subjected to hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), were studied to determine the effect of phenylephrine-induced changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) on cerebral blood flow (CBF). During CPB patients managed at 28 degrees C with either alpha-stat (temperature-uncorrected PaCO2 = 41 +/- 4 mmHg) or pH-stat (temperature-uncorrected PaCO2 = 54 +/- 8 mmHg) PaCO2 for blood gas maintenance received phenylephrine to increase MAP greater than or equal to 25% (group A, n = 10; group B, n = 6). To correct for a spontaneous, time-related decline in CBF observed during CPB, two additional groups of patients undergoing CPB were either managed with the alpha-stat or pH-stat approach, but neither group received phenylephrine and MAP remained unchanged in both groups (group C, n = 6; group D, n = 6). For all patients controlled variables (nasopharyngeal temperature, PaCO2, pump flow, and hematocrit) remained unchanged between measurements. Phenylephrine data were corrected based on the data from groups C and D for the effect of diminishing CBF over time during CPB. In patients in group A CBF was unchanged as MAP rose from 56 +/- 7 to 84 +/- 8 mmHg. In patients in group B CBF increased 41% as MAP rose from 53 +/- 8 to 77 +/- 9 mmHg (P less than 0.001). During hypothermic CPB normocarbia maintained via the alpha-stat approach at a temperature-uncorrected PaCO2 of approximately equal to 40 mmHg preserves cerebral autoregulation; pH-stat management (PaCO2 approximately equal to 57 mmHg uncorrected for temperature, or 40 mmHg when corrected to 28 degrees C) causes cerebrovascular changes (i.e., impaired autoregulation) similar to those changes produced by hypercarbia in awake, normothermic patients.\r"

  ".U": "89024018\r", 
  ".W": "Following brief periods (5-15 min) of total coronary artery occlusion and subsequent reperfusion, despite an absence of tissue necrosis, a decrement in contractile function of the postischemic myocardium may nevertheless be present for prolonged periods. This has been termed \"stunned\" myocardium to differentiate the condition from ischemia or infarction. Because the influence of volatile anesthetics on the recovery of postischemic, reperfused myocardium has yet to be studied, the purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of halothane and isoflurane on systemic and regional hemodynamics following a brief coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Nine groups comprising 79 experiments were completed in 42 chronically instrumented dogs. In awake, unsedated dogs a 15-min coronary artery occlusion resulted in paradoxical systolic lengthening in the ischemic zone. Following reperfusion active systolic shortening slowly returned toward control levels but remained approximately 50% depressed from control at 5 h. In contrast, dogs anesthetized with halothane or isoflurane (2% inspired concentration) demonstrated complete recovery of function 3-5 h following reperfusion. Because the anesthetics directly depressed contractile function, additional experiments were conducted in which a 15-minute coronary artery occlusion was produced during volatile anesthesia; however, each animal was allowed to emerge from the anesthetized state at the onset of reperfusion. Similar results were obtained in these experiments, demonstrating total recovery of contractile function within 3-5 h following reperfusion. Thus, despite comparable degrees of contractile dysfunction during coronary artery occlusion in awake and anesthetized dogs, the present results demonstrate that halothane and isoflurane produce marked improvement in the recovery of segment function following a transient ischemic episode. Therefore, volatile anesthetics may attenuate postischemic left ventricular dysfunction occurring intraoperatively and enhance recovery of regional wall motion abnormalities during reperfusion.\r"

  ".U": "89024020\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane were measured on two different mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation by isolated skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. A 100,000-dalton Ca2+-ATPase protein transports Ca2+ from outside to inside the SR membrane. At concentration ranges representing anesthetic levels of 0.06 to 2.3 times MAC, halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane each increased rate of Ca2+ uptake by SR. Each concentration of isoflurane produced a greater rate of Ca2+ uptake, whereas halothane and enflurane produced maximum stimulation of Ca2+ uptake at 1 and 1.6 times MAC, respectively. The second Ca2+ regulation mechanism studied was a Ca2+ release channel in the SR membrane. The release of Ca2+ via this mechanism requires a critical threshold Ca2+ load (nmol Ca2+/mg SR protein) for Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release to occur. Each anesthetic tested effectively lowered the critical Ca2+ load threshold for Ca2+ release, i.e., the Ca2+ channel was more readily induced to an open state in the presence of anesthetic. The concentrations of anesthetics having this effect on the putative Ca2+ channel were between 0.0026 and 0.078 MAC equivalents for each agent, and these concentrations are much lower than the anesthetic concentrations affecting Ca2+ uptake. These data show that in isolated skeletal muscle SR membranes a Ca2+ channel release function is altered at anesthetic concentrations far below those that change Ca2+ uptake function by a Ca2+-ATPase and below concentrations of the volatile agents producing clinical anesthesia. The Ca2+ channel effect may represent protein-anesthetic interaction, whereas the Ca2+-ATPase effect may occur by a generalized SR membrane perturbation by the anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "The free intracellular calcium concentration of suspensions of isolated rat heart cells was monitored during sequential exposures to halothane and caffeine to evaluate cellular mechanisms of the negative inotropic effect of halothane. The calcium-sensitive, fluorescent dye quin2 was used as the indicator of free intracellular calcium. The acute addition of halothane in concentrations greater than or equal to 0.062 mM (0.19 vol%) to suspensions of quiescent rat heart cells at 37 degrees C caused a transient (approximately 1.5 min) increase in free intracellular calcium concentration. The intracellular calcium concentration after the decay of this transient was not detectably different from that prior to the addition of halothane. Neither the reduction of extracellular calcium from 1 mM to 100 nM, nor the prior addition of verapamil (5 microM) decreased this halothane-induced calcium transient. The transient was completely blocked by the prior addition of 10 mM caffeine, which depletes the sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium. Also, the prior addition of halothane caused a reduction in the calcium transient due to caffeine. The depression of the caffeine-induced calcium transient by halothane was independent of the time interval (up to 4 min) between the additions of halothane and caffeine. These results indicate that halothane causes a net loss of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of quiescent rat heart cells. Thus, halothane has a direct effect at the sarcoplasmic reticulum, probably an enhancement of calcium release, which may explain its depression of myocardial contractility.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and bupivacaine following subarachnoid administration were studied in 12 surgical patients using a stable isotope method. After subarachnoid administration of the agent to be evaluated, a deuterium-labelled analogue was administered intravenously. Blood samples were collected for 24 h. Plasma concentrations of the unlabelled and the deuterium-labelled local anesthetics were determined using a combination of capillary gas chromatography and mass fragmentography. Bi-exponential functions were fitted to the plasma concentration-time data of the deuterium-labelled local anesthetics. The progression of the absorption was evaluated using deconvolution. Mono- and bi-exponential functions were then fitted to the fraction absorbed versus time data. The distribution and elimination half-lives of the deuterium-labelled analogues were 25 +/- 13 min (mean +/- SD) and 121 +/- 31 min for lidocaine and 19 +/- 10 min and 131 +/- 33 min for bupivacaine. The volumes of the central compartment and steady-state volumes of distribution were: lidocaine 57 +/- 10 l and 105 +/- 25 l, bupivacaine 25 +/- 6 l and 63 +/- 22 l. Total plasma clearance values averaged 0.97 +/- 0.21 l/min for lidocaine and 0.56 +/- 0.14 l/min for bupivacaine. The absorption of lidocaine could be described by a single first order absorption process, characterized by a half-life of 71 +/- 17 min in five out of six patients. The absorption of bupivacaine could be described adequately assuming two parallel first order absorption processes in all six patients. The half-lives, characterizing the fast and slow absorption processes of bupivacaine, were 50 +/- 27 min and 408 +/- 275 min, respectively. The fractions of the dose, absorbed in the fast and slow processes, were 0.35 +/- 0.17 and 0.61 +/- 0.16, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sampling area was the subpapillary venous plexus histologically because the depth for receiving reflectance is about 1.0 mm from the sole skin surface. One series observations was divided into five steps depending on the modes of combination of the applied pressure to ankle cuff and tilting. The Kubelka-Munk equation was utilized to calculate blood volume (Vb).

  ".W": "To evaluate the effect of hypocalcemia on myocardial creatine kinase (CK) depletion after brief coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion, dogs were rendered hypocalcemic via systemic hemodialysis for eighty minutes in the absence of Ca. Control animals were hemodialysed in the presence of Ca. The left anterior descending coronary artery was then occluded for six minutes and reperfusion for eighty minutes occurred at low flow of dialysate. A 50% decrease in serum Ca of the hypocalcemic animals during the eighty minutes of hemodialysis resulted in a significant (about 35%) decrease of myocardial Ca. Comparison of the myocardial creatine kinase activity following reperfusion showed preservation of the enzyme in the ischemic areas of the hypocalcemic animals, whereas the CK activities of the ischemic areas of the normocalcemic animals were much lower (p less than 0.005). During the reperfusion period serum Ca of the hypocalcemic group increased to 75% of that of the normocalcemic group while myocardial Ca of both ischemic and nonischemic areas reequilibrated to normocalcemic values. Hemodynamic parameters during the various phases of the experiment were not altered significantly. It is concluded that transient decrease of myocardial Ca produced by hypocalcemia prior to occlusion leads to protection against myocardial damage after brief coronary ligation.\r"

At rest the TcPO2 averaged 71.20 +/- 14.26 mm Hg (range 46-92) in the controls and 51.56 +/- 26.38 in the PVD patients (p less than .01). A wide overlap was observed between the two groups and among the different stages of the disease, and consequently, the diagnostic value of TcPO2 at rest was limited (sensitivity equal to 32%). During the recovery from ischemia the time constant (recovery half-time, T1/2) averaged 38.01 +/- 7.23 sec in the controls and 55.84 +/- 19.82 in the PVD patients (p less than .01). The T1/2 added to the diagnostic value of the method, making it more sensitive (55%), especially for stage II patients. The TcPO2 at rest was lower with increasing severity of the disease; both the TcPO2 at rest and the T1/2 correlated with the ankle-arm pressure index in the diseased limbs (r = .48 and -.41 respectively, p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-two patients, on further review, were found to have related complaints, seizures and syncope mainly, but not dizziness. Twenty-four patients had vertigo, 67 had nonvertiginous dizziness, and in 38 patients, there was insufficient information to categorize the dizziness as being vertigo or nonvertiginous dizziness. When the 22 nondizzy patients were compared with the 129 dizzy patients, the only statistically significant differences were that there were more blacks in the nondizzy group and that the aortic root dimension was, on average, 0.4 cm larger in the nondizzy group. These findings, although statistically significant, appeared to be clinically insignificant. There was, however, a high prevalence of valvular heart disease in both the nondizzy and two of the three dizzy subgroups. In most cases, the valvular abnormality had not been suspected clinically. But in no case was significant information added by echocardiography that helped in patient management. Thus, in the dizzy patient, echocardiography should be reserved for specific cardiac indications and not used as a routine screening test.\r"

Twenty normal patients (Group A) served as controls and their venographic patterns were analyzed by using four criteria: (1) delayed tracer transit time, (2) nonuniformity of flow and venous pooling, (3) jugular venous reflux, and (4) collateral venous filling. Control studies displayed no collaterals as a distinguishing characteristic but demonstrated the other three features to a variable degree. Of 106 extremities suspected of CRVT, 67 (Group B) were initially considered to have normal RNV findings (no collaterals). Contrast venography confirmed a normal pattern in 3 but identified CRVT with collaterals in 3 others. Retrospective review of the RNV studies confirmed faint collaterals in these latter 3. The 39 remaining extremities (Group C) showed abnormal RNV findings; contrast venography and postmortem studies confirmed the presence of venous disease in 5 patients. The authors believe that RNV is a reliable, noninvasive procedure for early diagnosis of venous occlusion associated with subclavian venous catheters.\r"

Values obtained improved significantly (p less than .0001) under therapy. Concomitant measurements of ankle-brachial indices showed no significant changes despite clinical improvement. Diabetic patients in this study seemed to benefit from treatment with pentoxifylline at least as much as nondiabetic patients. Photoplethysmography proved to be a very efficient and inexpensive method of studying the effects of pentoxifylline. Ankle-brachial indices are not a suitable method of detecting flow changes attributable to the mechanism of action of this drug.\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in patients before they began buflomedil treatment and during the last week of treatment. The interval of the rCBF measurements in the control subjects (n = 12) ranged from seven to forty-eight days. Mental function in the patients studied was evaluated by use of Hasegawa's simple intelligence scale for the aged and Zung's self-rating depression scale, before and during the last week of buflomedil treatment. The results showed a mean increase in rCBF of 10.5% +/- 12.1% in the patient group. The control group demonstrated virtually no change in rCBF measurements. Improvements in the mental function scores of the buflomedil-treated group were noted, and 5 of the 10 patients reported improvement in subjective symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "The electromagnetic field focusing (EFF) apparatus consists of a radio frequency generator, solenoidal coil, and a hand-held or catheter probe. Applications such as aneurysm treatment, angioplasty, and neurosurgery in various models have been reported. The probe is operated in the near field (within one wavelength of an electromagnetic field source) of a coil inducing eddy currents in biological tissues, producing maximal convergence of the induced current at the probe tip. The probe produces very high temperatures depending on the wattage selected for the given radio frequency of output power. The high temperature can be used in cutting, cauterizing, or vaporizing. The EFF probe is comparable to different types of lasers and to bipolar and monopolar cautery. The EFF probe can be used with catheters or endoscopes. Objectives of this study were to determine what the thermal properties of the EFF probe are and how instrument parameters can be varied to obtain different temperatures in the tissue near the probe tip. In this study an F2 catheter was used as an insulated sheath and the tip of the guide wire was used as the probe tip. Different powers, wave forms, coil-to-probe distances, and probe-tip lengths were tested on a phantom that simulates tissue electrical properties. Some of the experiments were conducted under normal saline to simulate treatment of tissue with body fluids such as blood vessels or brain tissue under normal physiologic conditions. It is concluded that the EFF probe has the advantages of easy manipulation, relative safety, cost effectiveness, and a high degree of spatial control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A blunted TRH-TSH test, suggestive of thyrotoxicosis, was found in 5 patients in Group I, 8 patients in Group II, and 2 patients in Group III. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was confirmed in 8 patients (by repeated TRH-TSH test and scintigraphy): 4 patients in Group I (12.1%) and 4 patients in Group II (12.9%). All of them had a nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Thyrotoxicosis should not be recognized in 6 of them if TRH-TSH test was not performed, because peripheral hormone levels were normal. Five of these 8 patients with thyrotoxicosis had reversion to sinus rhythm after treatment with carbimazole, either spontaneously or after cardioversion.

Thirty nonatopic (NA) children and their mothers were studied as controls. Total IgE and IgE to ALA, BLG, OA, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, and Lolium perenne were also investigated. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether in humans, as observed in animals, maternal allergen-specific IgG influences allergen-specific IgE synthesis in children. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 to ALA, and IgG1 and IgG2 to OA were more frequent in AD children than in NA children. As compared with mothers of NA children, mothers of AD children had similar frequency and levels of IgG subclasses to BLG and to OA, but a higher frequency of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 to ALA. In no case did total or allergen-specific IgE levels correlate with any subclass of allergen-specific IgG, which in turn influenced neither total IgE levels nor allergen-specific IgE distribution. The presence of allergen-specific IgG of any subclass in mothers was not associated with modifications in total IgE levels nor in allergen-specific IgG subclass distribution in AD children. But occurrence of IgE to OA was higher in AD children whose mothers had IgG4 to OA. This finding may be a model of interference in specific IgE response in the child caused by isotype response in the mother.\r"

These included an extremely elevated IgE (greater than 2000 IU/mL), extensive eczematoid dermatitis, and recurrent soft tissue infections. He had no history of atopic disease as a child. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a significant decrease in helper (CD 4) cells with a normal concentration of suppressor (CD 8) cells. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was detected in his serum. Previous studies of patients with atopic dermatitis as well as of patients with the hyper-IgE syndrome characteristically show decreases in total suppressor lymphocyte concentrations in peripheral blood. These results led some investigators to postulate that high IgE concentrations in patients with atopic dermatitis result from defective IgE specific suppression. More recent evidence suggests that helper cell function may be the more critical impairment in these disorders. The development of a hyper-IgE syndrome in this setting of T-helper cell viral affliction lends further support to the hypothesis that helper lymphocyte defects may have a key role in the development of atopic dermatitis and the hyper-IgE syndrome.\r"

Since the observed incidence of adverse reactions was 2.9% in NPH-insulin-dependent diabetics and 0.07% in non-diabetics, this represents a nearly 40-fold increased risk for diabetic patients (P less than .005). Skin testing appears to have limited applicability in the assessment of protamine sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "The diagnosis of asthma is often difficult in young children because their symptoms may not be typical and pulmonary function testing cannot be performed by the patient. We therefore performed methacholine inhalation challenges (MIC) in 24 patients 1 to 5.8 years of age in whom the diagnosis of asthma was uncertain. These patients had histories of recurrent respiratory symptoms for a mean duration of 2.4 years (range = 0.5 to 5.1) in the absence of other systemic diseases. Testing was done by either the 5-breath technique or 1-min inhalation via face mask until wheezing or coughing and retractions developed or a maximum methacholine concentration of 5 to 25 mg/mL was reached. Eighteen MIC were positive and six negative. The mean provocative dose was 3.0 mg/mL (range = 0.6 to 10). No patients suffered serious or delayed reactions and all symptoms reversed with inhaled bronchodilators (BD). During the MIC, the progression of symptoms often mimicked progression of those observed in the past and was useful in teaching the parents. Patients were followed for 0.5 to 3.8 years (mean = 2.3). All patients with a positive MIC have continued to have recurrent respiratory symptoms and require regular or intermittent BD. Only one patient with a negative MIC at 5 mg/mL has recurrent respiratory symptoms and requires daily BD 3 years after the initial evaluation. We conclude that MIC can safely be performed in young children in whom the diagnosis of asthma is uncertain. A positive MIC in this context demonstrates increased bronchial reactivity and is supportive of a clinical diagnosis of asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "As the number of elderly persons in the United States continues to increase, geriatric abuse has become the most recent manifestation of domestic violence seen in the emergency department. Recent data suggest that 1 million elderly persons are battered, neglected, or exploited each year by family members or caretakers. This maltreatment may be more difficult to identify than child or spouse abuse because of the relative isolation of the victims and their reluctance to report abuse. Many of these cases involve only subtle signs and have a great potential to pass undetected. We summarize the current literature on geriatric abuse and describe an ED protocol for identifying and reporting suspected victims. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 36 elderly patients hospitalized with documented abuse or neglect. Physical maltreatment was evident in 29 patients (80%), and 16 of the cases (44%) involved psychological abuse. Key points in the history, physical examination, and psychosocial evaluation were analyzed to identify specific criteria used in the development of the protocol. This framework will aid the emergency physician in the crucial first steps of identifying abuse, obtaining evidence, and providing immediate treatment and crisis intervention. Awareness that the problem exists and improved detection and intervention procedures are needed to prevent abuse of elderly persons from becoming more widespread.\r"

Willingness to take pneumococcal vaccine in the ED was independent of whether the patient had a primary medical provider (P = .77). Our immunization strategy complements other vaccination schemes that target those at high risk for pneumococcal disease and may in particular serve those patients who use the ED as their primary source of health care.\r"

Fifty-seven percent of ED directors and 51% of radiology department (RD) directors responded. Both groups reported that the most common practice pattern (60%) was alternating responsibility for immediate interpretation between emergency physicians and radiologists during a 168-hour week. Remaining hospitals were nearly equally divided between systems in which radiologists always provided immediate interpretation and those in which the emergency physicians always provided the initial interpretation. In all systems in which emergency physicians provided some immediate radiograph interpretation, radiologists provided subsequent review. Institutions varied as to the level of training of the physician in both the ED and RD who provided immediate radiograph interpretation; at least 30% of the institutions responding were reported to have either emergency physicians or radiologists of resident level providing immediate interpretation at least part of the 24-hour day. Interpretation discrepancy rates between emergency physicians and radiologists were estimated to be 4% to 6%. The large amount of variation among hospitals in ED radiograph interpretation systems suggests that these systems were not designed with quality of care concerns as their primary criterion. As a consequence, objective patient outcome and process measures need to be developed and measured to ensure that a particular internal system for ED radiograph interpretation is providing an acceptably high standard of patient care.\r"

Anticonvulsant effects were determined in 105 additional mice pretreated with either phenytoin 30 mg/kg (n = 35), phenobarbital 35 mg/kg (n = 30), or phenobarbital 60 mg/kg (n = 40) one hour before theophylline administration. The theophylline LD50 (95% confidence interval) was 239 mg/kg (range, 229 to 248 mg/kg) for controls, 204 mg/kg (range, 194 to 214 mg/kg) for phenytoin, 305 mg/kg (range, 288 to 323 mg/kg) for low-dose phenobarbital, and 319 mg/kg (range, 307 to 331 mg/kg) for high-dose phenobarbital.

Mortality, occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmias, and change in Killip class at 24 and 48 hours were the outcome variables. Data analysis by multiple logistic regression revealed that outcome was not improved, but a 29-minute median delay in hospital arrival occurred in paramedic-treated patients. Defibrillation was the only beneficial treatment performed by paramedics that could be identified. Current mobile paramedic unit procedures may need to be streamlined to eliminate the delay in hospital arrival resulting from extensive prehospital care.\r"

Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado, is a facility that in 1985 had 14.4 million passengers and a static employee population of 12,000 to 15,000. In 1981, there were 1,182 ambulance trips to the airport, 40.4% of which did not result in the transport of a patient. The expense of sending an ambulance and fire engine out on such calls was great, and paramedics were out of service for approximately 300 hours on these nontransport cases. In order to improve prehospital services to the airport and the city, a paramedic has been stationed in the concourse at the airport 16 hours a day since 1982. The records for airport paramedic services for the 12 months ending September 1985 were reviewed. Paramedic services were requested for 1,952 patients. Of these, 696 (35.7%) were transported to hospital by ambulance; 115 (5.9%) went by private car; 284 (14.6%) refused any paramedic care or transport; and 857 (43.9%) were released, after base station contact, with instructions to seek definitive care at the final destination. Presenting complaints were classified into 55 categories and the frequencies and dispositions are described. The most common presentations resulting in transport were chest pain, 110 (5.6%); syncope, 60 (3.1%); psychiatric, 57 (2.9%); abdominal pain, 49 (2.5%); seizure, 36 (1.8%); fracture, 31 (1.6%); and cardiac arrest, 29 (1.5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The monthly block curriculum is a major determinant of the overall residency training experience. The purpose of our study was to define the block curricula of the accredited emergency medicine residencies in the 1986-87 academic year. In a mail-confirmed telephone survey of residency directors, monthly block rotation data were obtained for 187 postgraduate years in 66 (98%) of 67 approved residencies; identified were 51 individual rotations in nine areas. The PG1 year, present in 47 (71%) of 66 residencies, resembled the flexible internship. Rotations in obstetrics-gynecology, medicine, pediatrics, and surgery accounted for 50% of PG1 year training time. Adult emergency department experience was 21% of PG1 year. In the PG2-4 (PG2+) years, 56% of clinical time was spent in the adult or pediatric ED (mean, 6.6 months per year). Electives and surgery rotations each accounted for 11% of PG2+ years training time. Emergency medicine-related areas and critical care rotations each accounted for 7% of the PG2+ years training time. Besides time spent in the ED and on electives, the most highly weighted individual rotations in the PG2+ years were orthopedic surgery, trauma surgery, and emergency medical services. Nearly all programs offered rotations in the adult ED, a surgical subspecialty, critical care, and an elective during residency training. The percentage of rotations requiring direct supervision by emergency physicians increased threefold by the PG4 year. Off-service rotations dropped 15-fold during the PG4 year relative to the PG1 year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pulse oximeter was attached to 62 consecutive patients who met local criteria for mandatory advanced life support base hospital contact. Arterial hemoglobin saturation (SaO2) levels and changes over time were documented by the pulse oximeter's integral printer and prehospital care reports prepared by paramedics. The pulse oximeter performed reliably in 60 patients (96.7%) by providing continuous SaO2 levels. Fifteen patients (24.2%) had saturations below 91%, and the pulse oximeter detected two (3.2%) otherwise undetected saturations below 80%. In each case, field intervention improved saturation. Pulse oximetry quantifies SaO2 changes correlated with many prehospital interventions: medications, suctioning, precarious gurney transport, oxygen therapy, and ventilatory assistance. The pulse oximeter performs reliably in the field and can be invaluable as an adjunct to patient care. Further prehospital studies are needed to evaluate specific field treatments and techniques, to assess the pulse oximeter's effect on morbidity and mortality, and to analyze the determination of severe hypoxemia in the field.\r"

The amount of the parent compound ingested was about 6 mg/kg of body weight. Administration of methylene blue was effective in the reversal of the methemoglobinemia. In vitro studies suggest that the activity of the compound was probably due to its biochemical transformation to the toxic metabolite p-methylphenylhydroxylamine. We expand the list of aromatic amino or nitro compounds and their derivatives capable of producing methemoglobinemia and call attention to the hazard of their ingestion.\r"

Abdominal pain and weight loss were the most common initial symptoms. Only one patient presented with an abdominal mass. Upper GI series were helpful but failed to show a definite abnormality in two of 18 cases. Endoscopic examinations in all 18 were compatible with malignancy on gross finding, but six out of 15 endoscopic biopsies were not conclusive. All four cases, which proved fatal in less than two years, showed serosal invasion and diffuse histological pattern. On the basis of our analysis, we suggest that in patients with abdominal pain and weight loss of more than two months duration an aggressive course of evaluation should include upper gastrointestinal x ray and repeated endoscopic biopsy. If symptoms persist, laparotomy and biopsy may be warranted even if endoscopic biopsy shows no neoplasm. Curative surgery is the treatment of choice, but radiation therapy should be added in patients with serosal involvement. Very careful histological assessment of pseudolymphomas is necessary, because they may contain malignant lymphoma.\r"

Injury type, injury cause, ischemia time, and zone of injury have previously been reported. In addition, this report analyzes the effect of injury pattern and surgical group upon outcome. This data implies a multi-factor effect on the viability of replanted/revascularized parts. The lack of thorough reporting of the factors may account for the variability seen in success rates of various centers. An injury-injury type-injury level-ischemia time classification scheme has been proposed to standardize the reporting and the discussing of amputation/devascularization injuries. In clear cut situations, injury pattern may simply reflect type of injury (e.g. avulsion); however, in those situations where the mechanism is unclear, injury patterns may provide prognostic variables valuable in predicting replant viability. Further, a multi-group, multi-surgeon service functioning within a hospital may have results comparable to those of a single surgeon or single group practice.\r"

  ".W": "High risk splenectomy is often encountered in cases of hypersplenism with massive splenomegaly (10 times usual weight of 150-200 g) resulting from myelophthisic processes. Intra-operative ligation of the splenic artery through the lesser sac is a technically useful method of gaining vascular control prior to mobilizing the challenging spleen. However, a massive or inaccessible spleen imposes mechanical limitations during surgery and may be complicated by torrential intra-operative hemorrhage in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia refractile to platelet transfusions. The authors describe pre-operative intravascular proximal splenic artery control in four adult patients (3 men, 1 woman) with extreme splenomegaly (2,250-10,000 g). The massive splenomegaly in this group resulted from chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2), isolated splenic lymphoma (n = 1), and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (n = 1). Chief symptom manifestations included left upper quadrant abdominal pain, early satiety, post-prandial emesis, dyspnea, petechiae, and associated easy bruising. Prior to surgery, all the patients were taken to the radiology suite where either detachable silastic balloons or stainless steel coils were placed selectively into the splenic artery under fluoroscopic guidance requiring approximately 35 minutes. Splenic artery occlusion aided normalization of thrombocytopenia (average increases 19,000/microliter to 215,000/microliter) with prolongation in survival of platelets. Successful splenectomy was subsequently performed with no additional transfusion requirements and was made technically easier by reducing splenic bulk. There were no adverse consequences of intravascular occlusion and no peri-operative morbidity or mortality. Preoperative intravascular selective splenic artery occlusion, used as an important potential adjunct to anticipated high risk splenectomy, is recommended.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The size of the splenic artery was found to be unrelated to the nature of the underlying disease, age of the patient, or history of variceal bleeding. An abnormally wide and tortuous splenic artery was identified only in those patients (five) in whom there was also radiographic evidence of splenic enlargement. Since the angiographic finding of an enlarged and tortuous splenic artery is known to correlate closely with increased flow in this vessel, this observation suggests that in patients with isolated splenic vein obstruction an increase in splenic artery flow accompanies splenic enlargement and is probably a critical component of the underlying derangement.\r"

In all but one instance the necrosis was limited to the right colon. Three additional cases of transmural necrosis involving both the right and left colon following a documented episode of shock are reported. Two cases were related to hemorrhagic shock following trauma and the third case followed a drug overdose with associated hypotension. An episode of hypotension was the common denominator in all cases previously reported. The lowest mean blood pressure in the present series was 35 mmHg. A diagnosis of subtotal colonic infarction was made at laparotomy in these three patients two to nine days after the initial hypotensive episode. Pathologic examination of the excised colon revealed transmural necrosis in all three cases with no evidence of a thrombotic or embolic process accounting for the colonic necrosis. The etiology was felt to be a low flow state within the splanchnic circulation. The data suggests that patients who present with a history of prolonged hypotension and shock are at risk for the development of colonic infarction. Successful management involves early diagnosis and resection of the infarcted colon.\r"

Uniquely, this case brings into simultaneous focus the principles of selective shunting for BGEV and the technique and rationale of splenorrhaphy, while furthering the list of indications for the latter. Splenic preservation, including splenorrhaphy following trauma, is being increasingly advocated as the role of that organ in hematologic and immunologic homeostasis is further elucidated. Too, in that small segment of the population with portal hypertension, preservation of the spleen for use as a route of selective decompression for bleeding gastroesophageal varices has been emphasized. The following case illustrates splenic preservation toward accomplishment of both of these ends.\r"

Knowledge of its predisposing factors and presentation are paramount in making the diagnosis. To facilitate the understanding of this condition, the authors reviewed their experience at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan for the period between 1977 and 1986. Eight patients who were hospitalized for other reasons were found to have rectus sheath hematomas. All patients were women with an age range of 26 to 85 years and a mean age of 58 years. The correct diagnosis was made clinically in four patients. In those in whom hematomas of the rectus sheath were not initially diagnosed, surgery was undertaken, at which time the condition was identified. Predisposing factors include trauma, childbirth, previous operation of the lower abdomen, and anticoagulant use. Ultrasonography may aid in the diagnosis but CT scan is most accurate in its ability to define the lesion. When diagnosed clinically, a conservative therapeutic program can usually be instituted.\r"

However, adrenalectomy in both cases revealed nonfunctioning cortical adenomas. Although both patients had some evidence of catecholamine excess, the early finding of an adrenal mass in each case appeared to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, selective venous assays resulted in false positive results in these patients. Interestingly, the selected venous assays falsely localized the catecholamine excess to the same side as the lesions found on CT. These cases demonstrate that localization studies should not be obtained prior to documentation of an unequivocal biochemical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. If this principle is violated, an incidental cortical adenoma found on CT may be mistaken for a pheochromocytoma. Since there are multiple sources of error during selective venous sampling, it should not be used routinely in the initial evaluation of patients with pheochromocytoma.\r"

These subjects were followed for three months in order to assess their postoperative visual acuity and to ascertain the reliability of the tests. Analysis of the data demonstrates the high level of reliability of both methods. Lotmar's visometer test gives a more exact assessment of macular function. However, in the presence of total lens opacity, the BFE test becomes necessary since Lotmar's test loses reliability in such cases.\r"

On histologic examination, dark-staining bodies appeared in the conjunctival epithelium in all 48/80-challenged eyes after day 3. These epithelial dark bodies (EDBs) rarely appeared in PBS-challenged or in single-dose 48/80-challenged tissues. The EDBs, between two and 15 per 30 fields at x 1000 under light microscopy, were limited to the conjunctiva near the fornix rather than near or over the tarsal plate. We hypothesize that these EDBs are associated with repeated application of secretagogue to the conjunctiva.\r"

A decrease in anterior chamber PO2 was usually observed within eight to 25 minutes and declined steadily thereafter. Within two hours, the drug caused a dramatic 60% reduction in anterior chamber oxygen tension (P less than or equal to .0005). We suggest that the mechanism for this phenylephrine-induced anterior chamber hypoxia is reduced blood flow, mediated by the direct vasoconstrictive effect of the drug and compression of the iris vasculature (induced by dilatation). The resulting decrease in the caliber of the iris arteries produced a parallel decrease in blood volume and flow which resulted in diminished PO2. Phenylephrine 10% may contribute to hypoxia and exacerbate the underlying pathology in those disorders where hypoxia plays an important causal role.\r"

These nine patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of surgical failures than the patients without the CHARGE association. The reasons are discussed, and computed tomographic scans demonstrate the anatomic findings of a more contracted nasopharynx and narrowed posterior choanal region. Thus, successful repairs require a more radical resection of the posterior nasal septum and lateral bony walls that can be achieved only with a transpalatal approach. The preoperative airways of CHARGE association patients are also at increased risk of obstruction and may require intubation or tracheotomy during the early life of the patient.\r"

The results of the preoperative evaluations were related to the histopathologic findings. Computed tomography was reliable for the estimation of paraglottic space involvements. It was also useful in detecting carcinomatous invasion into the preepiglottic space and aryepiglottic fold, but there were some false positives for these structures. It was not always reliable in assessing invasion of the laryngeal cartilages. It provided a very accurate estimation of involvement for the thyroarytenoid muscle and a considerably accurate assessment for the lateral cricoarytenoid and interarytenoid muscles and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. It was useful in detecting involvement of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, but there were a fair number of false positives. For the cricothyroid muscle, the estimation based on CT was not very reliable. Some erroneous judgments on CT were corrected in a comprehensive evaluation that included visual inspection.\r"

Nevertheless, inadequate excisions and troublesome recurrences still are encountered. We have reviewed 90 infants and children treated at The Children's Hospital in Boston over a 25-year period. Ten patients referred to our institution after an average of 2.4 prior operations per patient elsewhere suffered a recurrence rate of 30% after very wide reexcision. The remaining 80 patients who underwent primary excision at our institution had a 6.3% recurrence rate. All recurrences were managed successfully by further, wider excision. Histologic review demonstrated variability in patterns of drainage of the tract into the oropharynx, with accessory tracts and alveolar outpouchings off the main duct being present in 7.8% of specimens. This study demonstrates that the greatest opportunity for curative resection is at initial presentation, and that previous inadequate or unsuccessful excision is a major risk factor for further recurrence. The variability in microscopic anatomy of thyroglossal duct remnants can account for recurrent disease after lesser procedures, and underscores the importance of wide dissection above the hyoid bone. Our operative methods are illustrated.\r"

To simulate the dissection of air along fascial planes following tracheotomy, we placed catheters in either the pretracheal or subcutaneous plane and applied positive pressure to the catheters. The cats undergoing tracheal intubation were ventilated with excessive positive pressure. Computed tomography was used to document the progression of pneumothorax. High positive pressures during mechanical ventilation led to pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, and the mechanism was primarily the dissection of air along the perivascular sheaths of the pulmonary arteries, presumably due to rupture of perivascular alveoli. Dissection of air along the pretracheal fascia following tracheotomy produced pneumomediastinum but not pneumothorax. This suggests that pneumothorax occurring clinically is more likely a complication of assisted ventilation than a complication of tracheotomy surgery.\r"

Adequate control of these tumors may require extirpation of the visceral compartment of the neck and upper mediastinum. Preservation of parathyroid glands is sometimes inconsistent with good oncologic principles. Postoperative hypocalcemia develops rapidly, and high-dose intravenous calcium supplementation is required. Clinical observations indicated that requirements for calcium supplementation were reduced dramatically once oral feeding was instituted. It is postulated that dysfunction arising from surgical manipulation of the duodenum, the primary site for active calcium absorption, and bypass of that bowel segment by the feeding jejunostomy are primary contributors to the severity of hypocalcemia. A plan of management is proposed that includes early postoperative administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or dihydrotachysterol, active vitamin D metabolites that promote the absorption of calcium. Early oral feeding is encouraged. Other mechanisms of calcium loss, appropriate calcium management, and parathyroid autotransplantation are discussed.\r"

We have recently found decreases in suppressor inducer T cells in progressive multiple sclerosis as measured by two-color immunofluorescence using differentiation markers CD4 and 2H4. In the present study, we examined the relationship between functional suppression and circulating CD4+ 2H4+ T cells using a two-stage assay. (1) T cells were stimulated for 7 days with irradiated non-T cells (autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction [AMLR]) and harvested. It has previously been shown that suppressor T cells are generated during the course of the AMLR. (2) The AMLR-generated suppressor T cells were then incubated with mononuclear cells plus pokeweed mitogen, and immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis was measured. There was less AMLR-induced suppression of IgG synthesis in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis as compared with normal subjects and patients with other neurological diseases. More importantly, there were significant correlations between decreases in circulating CD4+ 2H4+ cells and the AMLR (p = 0.009). Thus, the decreases in functional suppression and the decreases in the AMLR in multiple sclerosis appear tightly linked to CD4+ 2H4+ cells, and their measurement provides a means to monitor suppressor function phenotypically. Decreases in suppressor inducer T cells may in part explain immunoregulatory abnormalities observed in multiple sclerosis.\r"

Significant changes in the ratio of two CD4+ T-cell subsets (CD45R-/CD45R+) were detected in 7 of 9 patients with MS, but not in any of the control subjects. Of those 7 persons, 4 suffered major clinical relapses substantiated by alterations in the neurological examination. The other 3 suffered minor relapses with subjective clinical abnormalities. All 7 had increased CD4+ T-cell subset ratios (%CD4+CD45R-/%CD4+CD45R+) within the month that new symptoms were reported. Most such increases resulted from a simultaneous depletion in the number of CD45R+CD4+ T cells and an increase in the number of CD45R-CD4+ T cells. One patient suffered a major relapse with no change in the ratio of CD4+ subsets but had a depletion of all CD4+ T cells. There were no consistent changes in any of the other subsets measured. These results indicate that a subgroup of patients with MS have abnormal fluctuations of two CD4+ T-cell subsets, which may correlate with increased disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "A cerebral cortical cholinergic reduction in dominantly inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) was recently described. Although the magnitude of the cholinergic reduction was similar to that observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), none of the OPCA patients was reported to have been demented. We now describe a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of 11 patients from one of the OPCA pedigrees which we examined biochemically. Detailed neuropsychological testing disclosed previously unrecognized deficits in verbal and nonverbal intelligence, memory, and frontal system function which were positively correlated with the severity of cerebellar ataxia. However, our OPCA patients appeared to be at most only mildly disabled by their cognitive impairment and scored within or close to the normal range on a simple mental status screening examination. This, as well as an absence of any aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia, contrasts with the profile and severity observed in advanced AD dementia, characterized by a similar cortical cholinergic deficit. This finding also suggests that cholinergic reduction may explain only part of the pathophysiology underlying the dementia of AD.\r"

Recording were made during stable isometric contractions at threshold, 10%, and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction using standard concentric needle electrodes. At supra-threshold forces, an average of 5.9 simultaneously active MUAPs were identified at each recording site. Mean amplitudes, durations, and numbers of turns all increased linearly with age in both low-threshold and high-threshold MUAPs (p less than 0.01), suggesting an ongoing process of progressive denervation and compensatory reinnervation. Mean MUAP firing rates decreased with age (p = 0.01) when force was measured proportionately, but not when measured absolutely. In a subgroup of 12 age-matched gender pairs, men had larger mean MUAP amplitudes, rise rates, and numbers of turns (p less than 0.05), probably reflecting larger muscle fiber diameters. These findings amplify previous observations from traditional analysis of lowest-threshold single MUAPs; establish a base of normative adult data for ADEMG; and further validate the clinical applicability of rapid, automatic EMG decomposition.\r"

We investigated the recall and recognition memory of 18 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and of 32 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the list-learning test using Buschke's selective reminding method, PD patients showed superior delayed recognition memory capability compared to AD patients, whereas immediate recall did not differ in the two groups. In the delayed story recall, PD patients were also able to benefit from rehearsal and probe more than AD patients. The results suggest that PD patients are able to bind information better into long-term storage than are AD patients. This may be due to better function in PD of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.\r"

Neuromelanin-containing neurons within the locus ceruleus and large nucleolus-containing neurons within the dorsal raphe nucleus and the central superior (raphe) nucleus were counted in 25 patients with AD and in 12 age-matched control subjects. Numbers of NFTs were quantified in the same regions. Counts were compared with clinical data, including psychiatric evaluations, available for 21 of the patients with AD. Within the locus ceruleus in the patients with AD, abnormalities were more severe at mid level than at caudal or rostral levels (p less than 0.01). Within the dorsal raphe nucleus, neuronal loss was most severe caudally (p less than 0.05). NFTs, but not neuronal loss, were demonstrated within the central superior nucleus. Neuronal and NFT counts did not correlate at individual levels; the relative severity of both pathological processes was consistent from level to level within nuclei but was less consistent between nuclei. Neuronal loss correlated inversely with age, particularly within the locus ceruleus. Duration of disease correlated inversely with counts of NFTs, particularly within the dorsal raphe nucleus, implying a correlation between NFT counts and rate of progression of disease as all but 3 patients had severe dementia. Significantly, patients with AD complicated by major depression had fewer neurons at the mid level of the locus ceruleus and at the rostral level of the central superior nucleus in comparison with nondepressed patients. There was a trend suggesting greater loss of neurons at all levels of the locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus in depressed individuals.\r"

The results were correlated to lesion activity, to the presence of class I and class II major histocompatibility antigen-positive astrocytes, and to the composition of cellular infiltrates. IFNs were detectable in active but not in inactive chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. In acute multiple sclerosis plaques, all three types of IFN were widely distributed on glial elements and infiltrating cells. In active chronic multiple sclerosis, labeling of cells for IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma was most pronounced at the lesion edge and displayed distinct distribution patterns. Overall, IFN-gamma was more common than IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and was predominantly found on astrocytes. IFN-alpha was detectable mainly on macrophages. Distribution of IFN-beta partially overlapped with that of IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha, in that it was present on some astrocytes and on some macrophages. IFNs were rare in normal white matter remote from lesions and in the gliotic lesion center. Ia antigen and human leukocyte antigen ABC on astrocytes were distributed similarly to IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, respectively. These findings indicate that IFN-gamma may play a role in active lesion growth in multiple sclerosis, whereas IFN-alpha and IFN-beta may exert some local immunosuppressive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Inhibition of human brain AChE by parathion is regionally selective. The biggest decreases (60-85%) were observed in the cerebellum, some thalamic nuclei, and the cortex. Only a moderate decrease (10-30%) was observed in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia, and no effect was seen in white matter.

We obtained CSF by lumbar puncture from four groups of nonmedicated subjects: (1) those with HD in the earliest stages of illness (n = 51), (2) those with parkinsonism, including idiopathic (n = 10) and atypical forms (n = 4), (3) those with nonparkinsonian movement disorders (n = 19), and (4) normal volunteers (n = 4). HVA was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, and motor signs were assessed in standardized fashion. The parkinsonian group had reduced levels of CSF HVA, but the other groups showed no significant differences. For those with HD, no correlation was found between HVA level and severity of parkinsonism, and there were no differences in HVA level between those subjects with (n = 14) or without (n = 37) prominent parkinsonism or between subjects whose age at illness onset was 30 years or less (n = 16) and those whose age at onset was over 30 (n = 35). Our findings indicate that in early, untreated HD, CSF HVA is in the normal range and does not correlate with the severity of parkinsonism. This observation supports neuropathological findings suggesting that parkinsonian features in HD are largely related to the loss of postsynaptic striatal dopamine receptors rather than to presynaptic nigral degeneration.\r"

The number of cases controlled at each therapeutic step did not differ between the two groups. In eight cases, four in each group, the disease was not controlled by the highest therapeutic step of the protocol, with four deaths from sepsis in the plasma exchange group.

Weekly assessments included counts of blisters, crusts, and erosions, and assessments of alterations in cutaneous pain, healing times, and activity times before further blister formation. Although considerable variability in individual responses was noted, no significant difference was detectable between the active drug and its matched placebo.

  ".W": "Two patients with rhabdomyosarcoma presented clinically with dermal nodules on the face. The first patient was a 12-month-old girl with a 2 X 3-cm-diameter red nodule on her left cheek that had begun as a small red papule when she was 3 months old and had progressively increased in size. The second patient was a 19-year-old girl who presented with an enlarging mass on her right cheek that had begun as a pea-sized nodule three months previously. In both cases, biopsies revealed a rhabdomyosarcoma in the underlying soft tissue with extension into the overlying dermis. Rhabdomyosarcoma presenting as a dermal nodule is rare. It usually presents as an asymptomatic papule without distinctive clinical features and therefore may result in delayed diagnosis unless a biopsy is performed.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis was possible in 33 and clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in nine. In addition, seven of 10 tumours investigated after treatment were abnormal. Ten of these 16 abnormal karyotypes have not previously been described. This pilot study has shown that a concerted investigation of tumour cytogenetics is possible. A multicentre study is essential if our knowledge of basic tumour cytogenetics is to progress.\r"

It presents in infancy and childhood in several ways, and the symptoms and signs include low birth weight, prematurity, congenital dislocation of the hips, easy inappropriate bruising (sometimes suspected as child battering), and a diagnostic facial phenotype. These features predict a lethal adult disease often complicated by fatal arterial rupture in early or middle adult life. Most affected patients can be diagnosed from radiolabelled collagen protein profiles by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prenatal diagnosis by specific type III collagen restriction fragment length polymorphisms is possible in some families, and will become increasingly important. Prenatal diagnosis and prevention of the disease in selected families is already possible and will be widely available in the future.\r"

While the overall prevalence of development and behaviour problems in the series was high there were particular associations noted between growth problems and developmental delay, between increasing age and behaviour disturbance, and between evidence of emotional deprivation and both behaviour disturbance and developmental delay. Children with non-accidental injury but without growth problems or emotional deprivation were least likely to show behaviour or developmental problems.\r"

Meconium staining of the amniotic fluid was also associated with asphyxial seizures, but there were high false positive (11%) and false negative (50%) rates. Fifteen of the infants who had seizures died (18%) and 21 (25%) were handicapped at 1 year. Outcome was most successfully predicted by the way the infant was feeding at 1-2 weeks. All infants taking more than half their estimated requirements by mouth at 1 week were normal, and those still being fed by tube at 2 weeks were handicapped.\r"

Of these, 315 babies were neonatal referrals and 91 were born in the unit after antenatal transfer from their district hospital. Significantly fewer of the babies referred as neonates survived (n = 167, 53%) compared with 67 of the antenatal referrals (74%), and 490 of those born in the unit (78%). They also had a higher incidence of major handicaps (24 of 167, 14%) compared with six of 67 (9%) of the antenatal referrals and 35 of 490 (7%) of those born in the unit. To control for selection bias among neonatal referrals, the outcome of ventilated neonatal referrals was compared with that of ventilated babies born in the unit. The two groups were comparable for the incidence of a wide range of neonatal complications. No differences in rates of survival or handicap were found. We conclude that sick babies transferred after birth to regional neonatal intensive care units have similar short and long term outcomes to sick babies born in regional units.\r"

Data included a household questionnaire, medical records of reported cancers and pregnancies, and birth and death certificates. The study areas appeared similar with respect to mortality, cancer incidence, and pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, rate ratios were greater than 1.5 for 5 of 19 reported diseases, i.e., ear infections, bronchitis, asthma, angina pectoris, and skin rashes. Prevalence odds ratios for 23 symptoms were uniformly greater than 1.0, and 8 symptoms had odds ratios greater than 1.5: blurred vision, pain in ears, daily cough for more than a month, nausea, frequent diarrhea, unsteady when walking, and frequent urination. The apparent broad-based elevation in reported diseases and symptoms may reflect increased perception or recall of conditions by respondents living near the site. These results indicate that future community-based health studies should include medical and psychosocial assessment instruments sufficient to distinguish between changes in health status and effects of resident reporting tendency.\r"

A control group of 104 female workers employed in a nondusty industry was also studied. The prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms was significantly higher in the exposed than in the control group. In particular, the prevalence of dyspnea (57.6%), chronic cough (22.8%), chronic phlegm and chronic bronchitis (19.6%), nasal catarrh (37.0%), and sinusitis (22.2%) was high when compared to controls (p less than .01). Among spice factory workers, a high prevalence of acute symptoms during the workshift was recorded. Acute reductions in lung function were statistically significant over the workshift for forced vital capacity (FVC), -2.0%; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0), -3.0%; and for maximum expiratory flow rates at 50% (FEF50), -8.3% and at 25% (FEF25), -15.2% measured on maximum expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves. No difference was found in across-shift ventilatory function in workers with or without chronic respiratory symptoms, except for FEF25 (with symptoms, 16.7%; without symptoms, 9.6%). Preshift administration of 40 mg of disodium cromoglycate (DSC) inhaled 15 min before the workshift significantly diminished acute reductions in FEF50 and FEF25 in exposed workers. Monday preshift FEF50 and FEF25 in exposed workers were significantly lower than in control workers (p less than .01), which suggests an early irreversible component to this illness.\r"

A semiquantitative assessment of early fluorosis was introduced. A 20.2% incidence of fluorosis was found, but, according to Roholm, only 1.05% was in stage I. The disease was mainly in the pre-stages of O and OI. A close relationship between the occurrence of fluorosis and the time and degree of fluoride exposure was found. The difficulties in diagnosing skeletal fluorosis result from the questionable sensitivity of the x-ray techniques and from the nonspecificity of the associated symptoms. A quantitative method to assess osteosclerosis and bone structure alteration is needed.\r"

This shift is consistent with a median lung burden of 110 mg Fe3O4, or 220 mg of the welding fumes characteristic for shipyard exposures. Among welders with 5+ yr of exposure, there is a slight but statistically significant correlation (r = 0.49) (p less than .0001) between inferred lung burden and lifetime occupational exposure. Although chronic bronchitis incidence and average lung function parameter values of the welders are different from those of the nonexposed cohort, respiratory status does not correlate further with either self-reported exposure or measured lung retention.\r"

Positive surgical margins were present in 10% of the cases; the actuarial overall local recurrence at 5 years (with or without distant metastases) is 10%. These results are consistent with past experience and data reported elsewhere in the literature. Radical cystoprostatectomy has been performed on 25 men over the past 5 years. Pathologic evaluation of all specimens demonstrated negative surgical margins, no patient has developed local recurrence, and of the patients who had cystectomy alone, 83% are now potent after surgery. With application of these principles to colorectal surgery, similar favorable impact on quality of life with improved surgical accuracy may be possible.\r"

Thirty-six RFAAs were treated surgically, with one death and no amputations occurring. Seven small RFAAs (less than 2.0 cm) were treated expectantly without complications. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, clinical characteristics and other factors influencing results in patients with RFAAs were compared to two control groups: patients who had undergone AFB without the development of femoral anastomotic aneurysms (FAAs) and patients who had undergone FAA repairs but without recurrence of FAA. Comparative analyses suggested: 1) local wound complications after initial AFB or FAA repair increased risk of a RFAA (p less than 0.03); 2) development of an FAA within 4.5 years after AFB increased risk of a RFAA (p less than 0.0002); 3) following an FAA repair, risk of a RFAA was almost three times greater for women than for men (p less than 0.05); and 4) patients with arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) were less likely to develop RFAA than those without ASHD (p less than 0.05). Among the 20 additional variables analyzed--including hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and etiology of primary vascular disease--no statistically significant influence on the development of RFAAs could be detected.\r"

The operations were performed for benign lesions in 182 patients, for primary hepatic malignancies in 106, and for hepatic metastases in 123, including 90 from colorectal cancers. The 30-day (operative) mortality rate was 3.2%, and there were an additional six late deaths (1.5%) due to hepatic failure caused by the resection. The highest operative mortality rate (6.3%) resulted from the trisegmentectomies, but this merely reflected the extent of the disease being treated. A mortality rate of 8.5% for patients with primary hepatic malignancy was associated not only with the extensiveness of lesions, but also with cirrhosis in the remaining liver fragment. There was no mortality for 123 patients with metastatic disease, 100 patients with cavernous hemangioma, 22 with liver cell adenoma, 17 with focal nodular hyperplasia, 16 with congenital cystic disease, and five with hydatid cysts. Trauma, pre-existing iatrogenic injury, and cirrhosis were the only conditions that had lethal portent in patients with benign disease. Furthermore, patients with benign disease who survived operation had minimal liability from recurrence of their original disease and none from the resection per se. By contrast, tumor recurrence dominated the actuarial survival rates for cancer patients, which at 1 and 5 years were 68.5% and 31.9%, respectively, after resection for primary hepatic malignancy, and 84.2% and 29.5%, respectively, for hepatic metastases. In this report, the expanding role of partial hepatectomy in the treatment of liver disease was emphasized, as well as the need for considering, in some cases, the alternative of total hepatectomy and liver replacement.\r"

  ".W": "Distal bypasses for the terminal stages of atherosclerotic occlusive disease manifest by chronic limb-threatening ischemia are among the most challenging arterial reconstructive procedures of surgeons today. The length and low flow rates of distal bypasses often exceed the functional limits of synthetic and even free vein grafts. However, the saphenous vein, when used in situ, provides a unique, viable, physiologically active, and hence antithrombogenic endothelial flow surface that is ideally suited for such bypasses. This paper presents the experience of the Albany Medical Center Hospital with the first 1000 in situ bypasses performed by the valve incision method over a 12-year period. Limb-threatening ischemia was the most common indication for surgery (91%). An in situ bypass was attempted in over 95% of unselected limbs and were completed in situ and in toto in 94%. 66% of the bypasses were carried out to the infrapopliteal level, and in more than 50% of the limbs, the distal vein diameter was less than 3.5 mm. The 30-day patency rate was 95%, and the cumulative patency rates, by life table analysis at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, were 90%, 86%, 84%, 80%, and 76%, respectively. The vein diameter, specific outflow vessel, level of distal anastomosis (length of bypass), inguinal inflow source used, and instrumental evolution had no significant effect on immediate or long-term bypass performance.\r"

As an alternative, pleuroperitoneal shunting for pleural effusions of various etiologies was evaluated. We implanted 36 shunts in 29 patients. Two patients had bilateral shunts and five had shunt revisions. The effusion was related to a malignancy in 22 patients, postoperative chylothorax in two patients, and other causes in five patients. Therapeutic thoracentesis had been attempted in 28 patients, and eight had had chest tube placement previously with attempted sclerosis. Seven patients had a trapped lung syndrome. There was no operative mortality. All patients were deemed ready for discharge from the hospital if they had recovered from the operation within 48 hours. Five patients had poor results, either because of a moribund status or their refusal or inability to pump the shunt. Of the remaining 24 patients, four had good results with temporary improvement, and excellent results were achieved in 20 patients (83.3%), who experienced symptomatic relief and stabilization or regression of pleural effusion until the time of their death. Patients with chylothorax experienced complete resolution. The 14 patients with malignant effusions had a median survival of 4 months, and there were no instances of peritoneal tumor seeding. In conclusion, pleuroperitoneal shunting is an alternative therapy for pleural effusions that requires a limited hospitalization only, is associated with minimal and short-term discomfort, achieves excellent results in properly selected patients, and is the only viable therapy when lung expansion cannot be achieved.\r"

In the 10(10) group, all antibiotic regimens decreased the 100% mortality that followed shock without treatment, but they had little effect on abscess formation. In unshocked rats at the 10(8) inoculum, SHORT was effective in reducing abscess number, diameter, and weight (all p less than 0.05 vs. control). After hemorrhagic shock, SHORT did not decrease abscess frequency, but it did diminish abscess diameter. LONG significantly decreased abscess diameter and abscess weight (both p less than 0.05). After shock, both MEGA and MEGA-LONG reduced abscess number (p less than 0.05 vs. control) and MEGA-LONG was superior to all other regimens at the 10(8) inoculum. These experimental data show that increasing both the dose and duration of antibiotic administration is more effective than standard short-course antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing experimental infection after hemorrhagic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Over a 17-year period, 92 patients with esophageal disease underwent colon interposition or bypass, with each operation performed by the same surgeon. The indication was cure of cancer in 20 patients, relief of dysphagia in 55 (cancer in 17 patients and benign in 38), loss of gastrointestinal (G.I.) continuity in ten, and tracheoesophageal fistula in seven patients (malignant in five, benign in 2). The thirty-day operative mortality rate was 5%, and the hospital mortality rate was 9%. Graft necrosis occurred in seven of 92 patients, four of whom later underwent a successful second reconstruction. Thirteen patients required subsequent revisional surgery. In 85 patients, the left colon based on the inferior mesenteric artery was used, and in seven, the right colon was used. Technical insights were gained to help preserve the blood supply to the graft and improve its function in transporting food. Thirty-four patients were available for interview 2-17 years after operation (median of 5 years) 28 of whom had benign disease, and six of whom had malignant disease); 82% of the patients felt they were cured of their preoperative symptoms, 18% improved, and none worsened. Eighty-eight per cent of the patients were able to receive an unrestricted diet. All patients except one were satisfied with the results of surgery, and, asked what they would do if they had to make the choice again, all responded that they would have the operation. Twenty-six of the interviewed patients had their eating ability evaluated with a test meal and the transit time of a liquid and solid barium bolus measured. Compared to controls, patients with colon interpositions consumed a smaller capacity meal over a longer period of time and were not dependent on liquids to flush the food through the colon graft. A colon interposition provides good quality of deglutition, is very durable, and is the organ of choice for patients who require an esophageal substitute and are potential candidates for long survival.\r"

  ".W": "The right ventricular isolation procedure was developed to treat medically refractory, nonischemic right ventricular tachycardia. The effect of this procedure on regional myocardial blood flow to the isolated right ventricle was evaluated in 10 adult mongrel dogs. There were no significant changes in aortic pressure, right ventricular systolic or diastolic pressure, or cardiac index following right ventricular isolation when the left ventricle and right ventricular free wall were synchronously paced. Myocardial blood flow to the isolated right ventricle was unchanged following the procedure (0.85 +/- 0.07 ml/min/gm to 0.87 +/- 0.08 ml/min/gm; p = not significant). Analysis of regional flow revealed that only a thin rim of right ventricular tissue near the ventriculotomy showed a significant decrease in blood flow (1.10 +/- 0.1 ml/min/gm to 0.29 +/- 0.04 ml/min/gm; p less than 0.05). Thus, this procedure leaves intact the blood supply to the great percentage of the right ventricular free wall. This finding supports the concept that the right ventricular isolation procedure is effective in isolating abnormal electrical activity without compromising regional myocardial blood flow.\r"

The thrombus was removed during the acute phase of myocardial infarction in 2 patients and one and two years, respectively, following the infarct in the remaining 2 patients. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 3 patients. There were no early or late deaths, and none of the patients had clinical or echocardiographic evidence of recurrent thrombi or emboli at follow-up 3 to 15 months later. These results indicate that left ventricular thrombectomy might be an effective treatment for patients with mobile, pedunculated, left ventricular thrombi. However, additional experience is required to compare surgical and medical treatment.\r"

During 120 minutes of cardioplegic arrest, 7 dogs with occlusive caval cannulation underwent right atrial (RA) perfusion with cold blood and 7 dogs with a single atriocaval cannula served as controls. RA perfusion produced a lower atrial septal temperature than atriocaval cannulation, 96% less electrical activity during arrest, and a lesser prolongation of the A-H interval after reperfusion (40% versus 123%; p less than 0.01). At the end of arrest, compared with atriocaval cannulation, RA perfusion was associated with improved preservation of creatine phosphate (71 +/- 10% versus 40 +/- 7% of control; p less than 0.05) and a lower level of lactate in the RA wall (8 +/- 1 mumol/gm versus 15 +/- 2 mumol/gm; p less than 0.01). We conclude that improved hypothermia reduces electrical activity and anaerobic metabolism in the atrial myocardium during cardioplegic arrest and improves atrioventricular conduction following arrest.\r"

We describe the cases of 8 children (aged 7 months to 6 years; weight, 6.3 to 21.5 kg), who underwent repair of DCRV via a right atriotomy. Six patients had ventricular septal defects. Peak systolic gradients in the right ventricular outflow tract were 26 to 135 mm Hg. The QP/QS were 1.1 to 2.5. Cardiopulmonary bypass times were 52 to 89 min (mean, 65.5 min) with aortic cross-clamp times of 20 to 56 min (mean, 39 min). Mean intraoperative gradients following repair were 5.8 mm Hg. Three patients had transient postoperative atrioventricular block requiring temporary pacing. Two patients required minimal inotropic support (dopamine, 2.5 to 5 micrograms/kg/min). The children have all been asymptomatic after hospitalization with follow-up times of 5 months to 4.5 years. No patient requires cardiac medications or has significant, persistent dysrhythmias; however, 1 patient required reoperation. Transatrial repair of DCRV allows excellent operative anatomical visualization and should be considered as an alternative to the transventricular approach in patients with this congenital heart defect.\r"

In 50 patients, the resection extended from the aortic valve (included in 33) to the beginning of the descending thoracic aorta and in 4, from the valve (included in 3) to the aortic bifurcation. Deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest were employed during the aortic arch resection; inclusion of the graft at the end of procedure was done in 44 patients; in the others, the diseased aortic wall was excised. Early mortality was 20 +/- 6% (11/54). Nine deaths were due to persistence of the distal dissection. Acute type A aortic dissection with aortic valve insufficiency should be treated as an emergency with extended aortic resection. As far as control of bleeding and closure of distal dissection are concerned, the best results have been achieved when the diseased aortic wall has been completely excised.\r"

The stenotic ring above the commissures was divided in two places by an inverted U incision extending into the right and noncoronary sinuses. A distal vertical incision in the ascending aorta converted this into an inverted Y. The ridge above the left coronary sinus was excised. The aortic incision was repaired with an inverted Y-shaped Dacron gusset. The postoperative gradient ranged from 0 to 30 mm Hg (median, 15 mm Hg). The extended aortoplasty provides excellent relief of supravalvular aortic stenosis and, in addition, restores the aortic root geometry to a much more anatomical configuration than is achieved with the simple patch technique.\r"

IABP usage increased in Group II (3% versus 1.6%; p less than 0.001). Immediate mortality was 40% (55/138). Use of the Percor balloon in Group II resulted in lower immediate mortality (32/93 or 34% versus 23/45 or 51%; p less than 0.06). Delayed mortality from multiorgan failure was 11.6% (16/138). Immediate percutaneous insertion at the bedside rather than a return to the operating room for open insertion yielded lower mortality (2/8 or 25% versus 6/7 or 86%; p less than 0.05). Open insertion of the Percor balloon decreases the failure rate of insertion compared with both the AVCO femoral conduit technique (7/85 or 8.2% versus 5/45 or 11%) and percutaneous insertion. It has more complications than the AVCO femoral conduit technique (7/85 or 8.2% versus 2/45 or 4.4%) and less than percutaneous insertion.\r"

  ".W": "We retrospectively analyzed two studies to determine whether smoking affected the treatment of hypertension. In a study of the effects of propranolol hydrochloride (a hepatically metabolized beta-blocker) vs hydrochlorothiazide, 108 smokers and 232 nonsmokers were randomized to the propranolol treatment group. The propranolol-treated smokers tended to be younger, taller, thinner, and wre more likely to be black. This group also had an initial blood pressure reduction (+/- SD) of -7.9 +/- 12.9/-8.7 +/- 8.4 mm Hg compared with -10.7 +/- 13.0/-10.9 +/- 7.1 mm Hg for the nonsmokers. Blood pressure increased less during the one-year maintenance period for the nonsmokers. However, when analyzed by race, this effect was seen in blacks, but not in whites. Diastolic blood pressure tended to be reduced more in nonsmokers (vs smokers) receiving hydrochlorothiazide (-12.1 +/- 6.7 vs -10.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg, respectively). The second study compared the effects of nadolol (a renally excreted beta-blocker) with bendroflumethiazide. There were no significant effects on blood pressure for either of these drugs. In both studies, there was a greater tendency for smokers to be terminated from the study irrespective of drug group. We conclude that cigarette smoking does interfere with the treatment of hypertension in general, and especially with reduction of blood pressure by propranolol in black patients.\r"

The subjects had a forced expiratory volume in 1 s ranging from 17% to 76% of the predicted value (mean +/- SD, 38.1% +/- 19%) and a waking arterial oxygen pressure from 46 to 84 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, 67 +/- 12 mm Hg). Polysomnography was done on three nights within a two-week period after the patients received on a \"blinded\" basis either placebo or 0.125 or 0.25 mg of triazolam. Triazolam produced improvements in total sleep duration, time spent in stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and subjective of sleep quality. For most patients, there was a nighttime drop in arterial oxygen percentage of saturation (SaO2) in the placebo condition, but triazolam did not cause a significant worsening, of the mean SaO2, minimum SaO2, or the number of apneic and hypopneic events. Across all experimental conditions, we documented little desaturation during wakefulness (mean low, 87.2% +/- 10.2%), more during NREM sleep (mean low, 83.2% +/- 12.6%), and most desaturation in REM sleep (mean low, 80.1% +/- 15.7%). We conclude that single-night use of triazolam improved the quality and duration of sleep in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In patients without severe waking hypoxemia and without carbon dioxide retention, triazolam did not increase either nocturnal hypoxemia or respiratory events during sleep.\r"

We prospectively assessed whether other, less severe, neuropsychologic abnormalities were also associated with aluminum. A total of 16 patients receiving chronic dialytic therapy were studied. The deferoxamine infusion test (DIT) was used to assess total body aluminum burden. Neurologic function was evaluated by quantitative measures of asterixis, myoclonus, motor strength, and sensation. Cognitive function was assessed by measures of dementia, memory, language, and depression. There were four patients with a positive DIT (greater than 125 micrograms/L increment in serum aluminum) that was associated with an increase in the number of neurologic abnormalities observed, as well as an increase in severity of myoclonus, asterixis, and lower extremity weakness. Patients with a positive DIT also showed significant impairment in memory; however, no differences were noted on tests of dementia, depression, or language. There was no significant correlation between sex, age, presence of diabetes, mode of dialysis, years of chronic renal failure, years of dialysis or years of aluminum ingestion and any neurologic or neurobehavioral measurement, serum aluminum level, or DIT. These changes may represent early aluminum-associated neurologic dysfunction.\r"

This study surveyed randomly selected active family practice patients 40 years and older to determine the prevalence and extent of the caregiving role and functional disability among elderly relatives. One in five patients (126/602) surveyed had caregiving responsibilities for noninstitutionalized relatives (total, 153 patients). One third of caregivers lived with the relative; most of the remaining two thirds visited their relative at least twice weekly. Caregivers reported some functional impairment in 60% of their relatives, and substantial impairment in 40%. The caregiving experience is common, and the potential for stress from managing an elderly relative's disability is substantial. Further research is needed to elaborate on the burden of the caregiver.\r"

Many physicians did not plan to withdraw therapy except intensive care, but most physicians planned to withhold a spectrum of life-sustaining therapies, from hemodialysis (86%) to intravenous fluids (21%). Attending and house-staff physicians generally agreed on whether to withdraw a given therapy or not but frequently disagreed on whether to withhold a therapy or not. After patient discharge or death, 88 charts were reviewed. None of the 88 patients was coded. Physicians initiated 68 life sustaining therapies in 43 patients and discontinued 64 therapies in 34 patients; there was no change in management in 31 patients. We conclude that individual physicians interpret the DNR order differently. These orders often are associated with the discontinuation or noninitiation of life-sustaining therapies other than emergency CPR.\r"

The vaccine order rate in GMC patients seen during the one-month study period in 1986 (n = 97) was compared with the rate in GMC patients from a similar period in 1984 (n = 77) and with the rate in patients seen in three subspecialty clinics during the 1986 study period (n = 106). Comparison patients were vaccinated only by specific physician order. Following the intervention, 79 (81%) of 1986 GMC study patients had vaccination orders, vs 20 (28%) of the 1984 GMC comparison group and 31 (29%) of the 1986 subspecialty clinic comparison group. A simple organizational change consisting of a standing order profoundly improved compliance with vaccination guidelines.\r"

The study was conducted in an internal medicine outpatient clinic. In addition to a comprehensive medical evaluation, the patients were administered the 260-item Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a highly structured instrument that enabled the physician-interviewer to make accurate psychiatric diagnoses. A thorough follow-up examination was given an average of 8.4 months later. Sixty-six patients had one or more psychiatric disorders that were considered a major cause of their chronic fatigue (mood disorder, 47 patients; somatization disorder, 15 patients; and anxiety disorder, nine patients). Five patients had medical conditions that were considered a major cause of their fatigue. The complaint of chronic fatigue remained unexplained in 31 patients. In this prospective study, two thirds of cases of chronic fatigue appeared to be caused by psychiatric disorders. A thorough evaluation of the mental health of patients complaining of chronic fatigue could therefore provide pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches and avoid unnecessary and costly medical investigations and therapies.\r"

The pleuropulmonary changes included pleural effusions, pleural thickening, and parenchymal lung disease. The patients developed symptoms from nine months to four years after starting treatment with bromocriptine that varied in dosage from 22 to 50 mg daily, while the patient receiving mesulergine was taking 6 mg daily. No other cause was found for the pleuropulmonary changes. In six patients the medication was discontinued with subsequent clinical, physiologic, and radiologic improvement. In two patients bromocriptine treatment was continued for one to two years, and in one patient there was further physiologic and radiologic progression of the pleuropulmonary changes. These findings suggest a causal relationship between bromocriptine treatment and pleuropulmonary disease. We recommend a chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function evaluation prior to bromocriptine treatment with follow-up studies if the patient develops respiratory symptoms. Physicians prescribing bromocriptine should be aware of this side effect to ensure early recognition and prompt withdrawal of bromocriptine therapy.\r"

Before the education program, 18 (14.6%) of 123 patients with no pressure sores developed pressure sores during their hospital admission. After the education program, only six (5.4%) of 105 patients who entered the hospital with intact skin developed a pressure sore during their hospital stay.

Most published studies report relative measures of risks such as the risk ratio. However, clinicians are concerned with the magnitude of risk, or attributable risk, the difference in risk in those with highest and lowest serum cholesterol levels. Since maximum risk modification is rarely achieved, the attributable risk often overstates the potential benefit of risk factor reduction. A variant of the attributable risk, the practical attributable risk, gives a more realistic estimate of potential benefit. Since clinicians treat individuals and not populations, these measures of risk are most useful if reported for subgroups of patients (eg, men and women, as well as those of varying age). To illustrate these concepts, we review the literature on hypercholesterolemia, report the risk ratio, attributable risk, and practical attributable risk for important patient populations, and discuss the implications for clinical practice.\r"

This tablet was similar in appearance to a dried aluminum hydroxide gel preparation (Alu-tab) that the patient was taking as a phosphate binder. She had mistakenly been taking six Disalcid tablets with each meal. Her salicylate level was 5.86 mmol/L, but she had no change in her serum electrolyte levels or acid-base status. When the salsalate treatment was stopped and regular dialysis treatments were continued, the symptoms of salicylism resolved. This case illustrates one of the potential dangers of polypharmacy in patients with chronic disease. The midl course was probably due to ongoing hemodialysis, which prevented the appearance of the usual acid-base abnormalities of salicylate intoxication.\r"

Agreement was assessed by two methods: one was based on themes that were tailor-made for each case, while the other was based on coding themes into a standard set of categories. To assess agreement on the tailor-made formulations, a paired-comparisons procedure was used. For a sample of 35 patients, the similarity ratings for matched cases were significantly higher than for purposely mismatched cases. Using the standard set of categories, agreement was also good; weighted kappa values ranged from .61 to .70. The results also demonstrate reliability for the location of the relationship episodes, which form the database for the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme. Our positive results suggest that this guided clinical method can be used reliably as a measure of relationship patterns in psychotherapy; our results provide the first moderate-sized sample demonstration of clinicians' agreement in formulating this complex concept.\r"

Of primary interest is whether the control group should be completely free of disease-associated symptoms. To test the effect of the selection of psychiatric symptom-free controls, we examined the control group from our long-term follow-up and family study of major psychoses. Morbidity risks for psychiatric disorder among relatives of surgical controls were estimated, both for an unscreened proband group of 361 patients and for a screened group of 318 from which the relatives of controls with significant \"psychiatric history\" had been eliminated. The largest difference occurred with affective disorders, which were more frequent among the relatives of unscreened controls than among the relatives of the screened controls. Our results suggest that gathering data on both screened and unscreened control groups will yield more generalizable results than either alone.\r"

A sample of 149 mothers of young children, approximately half of whose husbands became unemployed due to layoff during the two-year study period, was examined. We hypothesized that husbands' layoff would cause elevations in psychiatric symptoms and that women with particular risk factors would be more vulnerable to the impact of this event. The effects of the following eight risk factors, measured before husbands' layoff, were examined: psychiatric history, familial psychiatric history, three or more children in the home, lack of employment outside the home, financial difficulties, low marital satisfaction, low social support from relatives, and low social support from friends. Although husbands' layoff did not have short-term effects on wives' symptoms, their levels of distress were elevated by the end of the study period. In addition, three risk factors--familial psychiatric history, financial difficulties, and low social support from relatives--significantly increased women's vulnerability to long-term psychological distress following their husbands' layoff.\r"

  ".W": "Aortas and coronary arteries from six populations were studied histologically. Two kinds of fibrous plaques could be defined morphometrically, a fibroplastic and an atheronecrotic kind. These two kinds of abnormality were quantitated, the percentage of the specimen affected by atheronecrosis being one quantity, and the average fibroplastic thickness of nonnecrotic intima being the other. These two quantities were found to be correlated with each other, showing that aortas or coronary arteries severely affected by one of these processes tended to be seriously affected also by the other process. This correlation persisted after age adjustment. The two processes, however, failed to parallel each other across population boundaries. Moreover, some of the subjects with coronary heart disease had excessive fibroplasia with minimal atheronecrosis, while others had excessive atheronecrosis with minimal fibroplasia, as if an excess of only one or the other can be fatal. A novel theory is proposed to explain these and other results. It is proposed that the arterial intima undergoes fibroplastic thickening under the time-dependent action of one set of hypothetical causes and that another set of hypothetical causes promotes the emergence of atheronecrosis in the most thickened and aged places. These two sets of causes appear to be independent of each other in their distribution among human populations.\r"

The results reported by the participants were highly concordant for the determination of modal chromosome count and sex chromosome designation. More than 90% of the participants correctly identified the following abnormalities: trisomies 8, 13, 18, 21, and X; monosomy X; t(9;22); t(8;21); der(2) t(2;?); and 5p-. Abnormalities A fra(X)(q27), t(5;11), inv(16), and t(15;17) were correctly identified by more than 80%, 70%, 70%, and 60% of the participants, respectively. The participants had the most difficulty with diagnoses that involved photographs of high-resolution chromosome banding. The 1986 survey was not graded, but the 1987 cytogenetics survey will be scored on those challenges where there is at least 80% consensus among the participants.\r"

The results showed that, stage for stage, the grade further subdivided the overall survival rates for each site into distinct subsets that were significantly different. The study confirms the concept of grade as applied to cancer and the relation of grade to survival. From the results, the conclusions are reached that grading is prognostically valuable, especially when analyzed with respect to survival in a population, and that the grade provides prognostic information in addition to the stage of disease. It is proposed that three grades be adopted to minimize statistical variation. The results are considered significant, since neither standard nor uniform guidelines have existed for grading that pertain to all sites.\r"

Nine of the patients were severely immunocompromised: four had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, three had ulcerative colitis and were receiving high-dose steroid therapy, one was a bone marrow transplant recipient, and one had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was receiving therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Four of these had evidence of CMV infection by routine histology and DNA hybridization. Three additional immunocompromised patients had evidence of CMV infection by DNA hybridization alone. Forty-four patients had inflammatory conditions or ulcerations of the lower gastrointestinal tract. Six of these had evidence of CMV by DNA hybridization alone. Histologically normal as well as enlarged and cytomegalic cells were probe positive, and the cells were sparse to numerous in number. They were found in the epithelium and/or lamina propria. This technique was demonstrated to be applicable to routinely processed colonic biopsy specimens.\r"

Macroscopic examination confirmed the nonobstructive ductal dilatation and also showed a number of cysts in all cases. Microscopically, the dilated bile duct walls were composed of fibrous walls and were free of other pathologic changes, suggesting that the biliary dilatation was congenital in origin. Small microscopic bile ducts, however, were not dilated and were free of ductal plate malformation. In addition, Meyenburg's complexes and liver cysts not communicating with the biliary tract lumen were seen. It was suggested that adult polycystic disease, Meyenburg's complexes, and congenital intrahepatic biliary dilatation could coexist in some patients.\r"

Serial histologic sections and reconstruction of the lower urinary tract demonstrated severe prostatic hypoplasia with a dilated, angulated prostatic urethra. Obstruction appeared to be present at the internal sphincter as a result of loss of prostatic support of the bladder. The bladder was distended and hypertrophic, and had a disruption of its wall near the apex. Massive ascites and intraabdominal urine accumulation had produced abdominal distention and pulmonary hypoplasia. The findings in this case lend support to the concept of prostatic hypoplasia as a cause of prune-belly syndrome and to the unexplained association between trisomy 18 and genitourinary anomalies including the prune-belly syndrome.\r"

It is characterized by acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, organic aciduria, and \"sweat-sock\" odor. Neonatal GA II differs from most inborn metabolic errors in that there are prominent congenital malformations. We recently observed two infants at autopsy with GA II whose malformations included: subcortical renal glomerular cysts, renal medullary dysplasia, cerebral pachygyria, pulmonary hypoplasia, and facial dysmorphism. In addition, there was lipid accumulation in liver, heart, and renal tubular epithelium, tissues that use fatty acids as a primary source of energy. Review of previous reports of 12 patients showed that these lesions are typical of neonatal GA II. The pattern of lesions, in particular the striking localization of renal dysplasia to the medulla, suggests that the malformations may be the consequence of an accumulation of toxic metabolites that is not corrected by placental transfer.\r"

Although MCs were identified in all the cases, the most impressive perifollicular proliferation of ECs and MCs was seen in the hyperthyroid patient with TH/LH, suggesting that these cells have a role in immune function. The unusual combination of LH and TH in this patient demonstrates that exceptional cases can show overlapping features of what are otherwise considered to be separate thymic lesions. The observations that MCs occur in close proximity to ECs and ECs are depleted along with MCs in myasthenia gravis provide strong evidence supporting closely related histogeneses for ECs and MCs within the thymus.\r"

On the basis of hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections alone, a histologic continuum was observed ranging from minimal paracortical changes to fully developed dermatopathic lymphadenitis. Twenty-three lymph node biopsies previously interpreted as diagnostic of dermatopathic lymphadenitis were reviewed. Only nine of these showed the fully developed dermatopathic lymphadenitis. Only one of these patients had a dermatitis. Our conclusions are that the presence of dermatopathic lymphadenitis does not mean that the patient has concomitant skin disease, and that axillary lymph nodes from patients without skin disease manifest a spectrum of dermatopathic lymphadenitis-like histologic features. Dermatopathic lymphadenitis may represent one end of a normally occurring histologic spectrum that may be found in the absence of a dermatitis.\r"

Current treatments focus on the return of motor function despite the fact that the full potential of motor function is not used in limbs with sensory deficits. A rationale based upon current neurophysiologic concepts is presented with a program of sensory reeducation of the hand. The organization and use of sensory inputs is analyzed to determine the modalities critical to hand function and the body surfaces important for daily tasks. The treatment program is rationalized in terms of the rules governing somatosensory cortical reorganization after trauma, and a case history is presented. Therapy begins with the delivery of sensory inputs to many receptors and pathways from important sensory surfaces. Inputs are delivered at an intensity sufficient for appreciation in a task structured to motivate the patient. Initially, electric stimuli are used. Then cutaneous mechanoreceptors are stimulated by stroking selected skin surfaces with inputs that have high frictional or shearing components, such as Velcro. As therapy progresses, tools are modified to enhance sensory appreciation during retraining of important tasks. Skills related to tactile form recognition and exploration are carefully shaped. A pilot project with six patients suggests some recovery of sensation and manipulative functions.\r"

Quantitative data on the effect of frontal plane limb position on the isometric hip abductor strength of ten otherwise healthy AKAs were obtained in the standing position. Residual limb isometric and isokinetic abductor strength was also measured and compared with that of the intact limb and with that of ten healthy age-, sex-, and height-matched control subjects using an identical technique. The testing hardware consisted of a modified Cybex II Isokinetic Dynamometer with a custom-made pelvis and trunk stabilizing device. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Results showed an essentially linear increase in residual limb abduction strength with progressive adduction from 30 degrees abduction to 16 degrees adduction. The average increase in abduction torque was .97% (range .29 to 1.5) of the peak neutral position strength per degree of change in femur angle when corrected for the effect of gravity. Similar strength increases with adduction of the femur were found for intact and control limbs. Mean residual limb isometric abduction torque measured 30% less than the intact limb value (p = .0018). The difference between the intact and the control limb mean isometric abduction torques was less than 1%. Isokinetic testing was technically more difficult than isometric testing but revealed similar weakness of the residual limb abductors when compared to the intact and control limbs.\r"

It has recently been suggested that a high energy cost of walking (Cw) may be an important contributing factor to the observed dyspnea and fatigue. The purpose of this study was to determine which factors influence Cw. Clinical tests were used to assess the major alterations of the motor system. Thirty-three patients (mean age 41 years, mean maximal speed 2.8 km/h, range 1.2 to 6.2 km/h) in a stable phase of their disease were examined. Cost of walking (mean +/- SE) at 1.8 km/h was 0.287 +/- 0.018 ml 02.kg-1.m-1 (normal value 0.163 +/- 0.007, p less than 0.001). A multivariate regression analysis showed that Cw was significantly related to spasticity of the lower extremities, whereas lower extremity and truncal weakness did not contribute to the observed high Cw.\r"

The patients, who were followed for six months, experienced subjective change in functional status but failed to show significant change on the pyramidal, cerebellar, or visual functional scores of the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). The prevalence of upper extremity dysfunction in multiple sclerosis, as measured by the 9HPT and the BBT, is higher than previously appreciated. The 9HPT and BBT are more sensitive in detecting upper extremity functional status change than the EDSS and should prove helpful in following patients in clinical trials.\r"

The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence and duration of loss of consciousness and posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), and to establish the risk factors for combined CHI and SCI. The overall incidence of CHI as defined by the presence of PTA of any duration was 49%. There was a significantly increased risk of CHI for patients involved in traffic accidents (risk ratio = 3.7; 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 7.2).

The first survey sample consisted of 502 hospitals; 163 (52%) of the 313 respondents were identified as facilities providing inpatient arthritis rehabilitation. A second survey regarding patient and program characteristics was completed by 146 of the 313 facilities. The data from rehabilitation units serving arthritis patients are presented with regard to utilization, discharge disposition, sources of payment, patient demographic and diagnostic information, and specialization of the rehabilitation program. The data indicate that persons with arthritis are underrepresented in the rehabilitation population, although the diagnosis is approved for admission under rehabilitation guidelines. This underutilization is attributed to problems of reimbursement, inappropriate admission criteria, inadequately trained staff, and lack of referrals.\r"

Although he was sensitive to the pressor effects of vasoconstrictor drugs (dihydroergotamine, caffeine, and a somatostatin analogue), these agents failed to stabilize his walking blood pressure. With drug therapy, however, the patient could maintain an adequate blood pressure while performing isometric exercises on a tilt table, whose angle was gradually increased during three weeks. After this conditioning program, pressor drug therapy made it possible for the patient to walk. Although the physiologic basis for this therapeutic response is unclear, our results indicate that tilt table conditioning may be an important adjunct to drug therapy in patients with severe orthostatic hypotension.\r"

The primary five-year cumulative patency rates were 78% for autogenous vein and 52% for polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. There were two (0.8%) 30-day operative deaths and a subsequent five-year amputation rate of 2.4% for both groups. Femoropopliteal reconstruction for claudication may therefore be carried out with acceptably low operative mortality and a subsequent amputation rate comparable with that anticipated from the natural history of the disease. While the five-year patency rate is significantly higher utilizing autogenous vein grafts, symptomatic relief may be expected with prosthetic grafts in approximately half the patients without incurring a higher risk of limb loss.\r"

We measured runoff resistance in 80 consecutive patients who had undergone infrainguinal bypass surgery, and periodically assessed graft patency. There were 57 femoropopliteal bypass grafts and 23 infrapopliteal bypasses. After 3, 6, or 12 months, there was no significant difference in mean resistance between those grafts remaining patent and those that failed. Moreover, among patients with very high resistance (greater than 1.2 mm Hg/mL/min), 12 bypass grafts remained patent for more than one year. These results demonstrate that even patients with relatively high runoff resistance can undergo successful bypass grafting. Consequently, patients with measured or angiographic evidence of poor runoff should not be denied vascular reconstruction on this basis alone. We believe that graft failure is a multifactorial process in which the nature of the graft material, location of the distal anastomosis, runoff resistance, and a number of other factors are likely to play a role.\r"

  ".W": "To document both the long-term survival and the quality of life of patients following surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the records of 65 patients with ruptured AAA resection were compared with those of 100 who underwent elective AAA resection. The actuarial survival following ruptured aneurysm surgery was 92%, 51%, and 51% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and did not differ statistically for patients after elective AAA surgery or for an age- and sex-matched sample from the general population. Based on responses to a quality of life survey, there were no discernible differences in life-style, degree of independence, or productivity following either ruptured or elective AAA surgery. Survivors of ruptured AAA have an excellent long-term prognosis and expectation for a good quality of life.\r"

The adjunctive measures of foot dependency (36 cm below heart level) and nasal oxygen of 3 L/min were evaluated in these patients. In general, the improvement in tcPO2 levels with these adjunctive measures was not related to basal levels of forefoot or arm tcPO2. One can expect an increase in tcPO2 level of approximately 22 mm Hg while employing the dependent position and an additional benefit of 12 mm Hg with the administration of nasal oxygen. Of the 35 patients with a basal forefoot tcPO2 level of less than 10 mm Hg, 11 did not respond to these adjunctive measures.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of repetitive mechanical stretching on smooth muscle cell (SMC) collagen production. Porcine SMCs from passages 3 through 7 were seeded in 35-mm2 flexible-bottomed culture wells at a concentration of 2 x 10(5) cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 hours. The experimental group was placed in a vacuum-operated stress-providing instrument that exerted an average elongation of 25% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom. The stretched cells (nine wells per day) were subjected to a cyclic force regimen of 10 s of elongation and 10 s of relaxation for five days. The control cells (nine wells per day) were subjected to incubation conditions similar to those in the experimental group but without cyclic stretching. Twenty-four hours before harvesting, serum-free medium containing 50-microCi tritiated proline, an amino acid hydroxylated in collagen (hydroxyproline), and 50 micrograms/mL of ascorbate was added per well. On days 3 and 5 the medium and cells were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and then sedimented, lyophilized, and analyzed to separate hydroxyproline and proline. Values for collagen and noncollagen protein were calculated after quantitation of the hydroxyproline and proline concentrations. The results indicate that three-cycle-per-minute stretching coordinately stimulated SMC production of collagen and noncollagen protein. We conclude that pulsatile stretch enhances collagen and noncollagen protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "Retrospective analysis of 108 patients who received indium 111-labeled murine monoclonal antibodies for imaging of cancer was performed. Most patients had operative procedures for colorectal carcinoma following completion of scintiscanning. Eleven patients had markedly elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels postoperatively without evidence of residual or recurrent disease. The laboratory method of measuring CEA levels was a commercially available double mouse monoclonal antibody enzyme immunoassay. It was postulated that the unexplained elevation of CEA was a reflection of the presence of human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) induced by the administration of radiolabeled mouse antibody. A competitive assay for HAMA was undertaken by incubation of these patients' sera with a high dose of nonspecific mouse immunoglobulin prior to CEA determinations, and subsequent CEA levels were normal. The presence of HAMA was confirmed by a noncompetitive solid-phase enzyme immunoassay in 73% of tested patients who received murine monoclonal antibodies for imaging. Identification of artifactual CEA elevations is important in the treatment of cancer patients.\r"

  ".W": "Ileal reservoirs have been used almost routinely in conjunction with total colectomy and the endorectal ileal pullthrough procedure for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis. Of 153 patients who underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center during the past seven years, a comparison was made between 14 patients with an initial reservoir length of greater than 30 cm (large) and 54 patients with a short reservoir (14 to 20 cm). Although patients with long reservoirs had a low stool frequency in the first postoperative year, there was a subsequent increase. During the first two postoperative years, six (43%) of 14 patients developed reservoir enlargement with secondary pouchitis and diarrhea, which severely limited their activities, finally requiring partial resection. Only one of the 14 patients with short reservoirs who underwent surgery more than two years previously had a resection. Complications requiring operative treatment were more than five times greater in patients with long reservoirs. All patients with shortened reservoirs experienced dramatic improvement in their clinical course within one month. Ileal reservoirs of 14 to 16 cm in length appear to provide long-term, excellent clinical function, with an incidence of pouchitis of less than 5%. Symptoms in patients with large reservoirs may be greatly improved by reservoir shortening.\r"

  ".U": "89025136\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with combined aortoiliac and femoropopliteal occlusive disease, severe involvement of the deep femoral artery (DFA) has often been considered an indication for simultaneous aortofemoral and femorodistal bypass grafting. In 73 patients (87 limbs) with multilevel disease, extended DFA reconstruction was performed with aortofemoral bypass. Five-year actuarial patency of the reconstructions and overall five-year actuarial limb salvage were 62.2% and 60.2%, respectively. Of 20 variables tested, four were significantly associated with the functional outcome of the procedures. Multivariate analysis identified two factors as predictive of outcome independently from other variables: preoperative ankle-brachial pressure index and angiographic status of the below-knee popliteal artery. However, in case of reoperation for occluded aortofemoral graft, these factors lost their validity. Extended DFA reconstruction is a valuable and durable procedure able to provide an adequate outflow and distal perfusion. Careful judgment in each clinical situation will aid in selecting a small group of patients in which simultaneous femorodistal bypass is required.\r"
