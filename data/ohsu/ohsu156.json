  ".U": "87273344\r", 
  ".W": "There is now considerable evidence to suggest that some aspects of early lesion formation and later lesion growth are a reaction to injury. Hemodynamic factors are important in determining the site of injury and may produce injury directly. Injury can lead to atherogenesis in animal models as well as in humans. Superficial injury exposes the subendothelium, allowing platelet adhesion, which at high shear rates is dependent on vWF. Platelet adhesion and degranulation release PDGF, which stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation, synthetic functions, and vasoconstriction. LDL stimulates smooth muscle cell growth as well as damages endothelium in some experimental systems. Thus, a link is provided between platelet and lipid involvement in atherosclerosis. Direct evidence for a role of platelets in atherogenesis comes from studies in which animals were treated to reduce platelet number or function or in which platelet function is genetically impaired (pigs with von Willebrand's disease). In these models, reduced platelet function is associated with less atherosclerosis. Deeper injury exposes collagen, with subsequent platelet aggregation, thrombin and fibrin generation. The role of reduced production of PGI2 and fibrinolytic agents following severe damage is unknown. Deep injury to the vessel occurs during plaque fissuring, the pathologic process underlying most cases of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and some cases of sudden death. Angioplasty produces amelioration of many patients' symptoms and is safe. However, acute occlusion occurs occasionally, and restenosis in the first year occurs in some 30 percent of patients treated. Angioplasty damages the arterial wall, with endothelial denudation and intimal and medial splitting. Why does this, and plaque injury, by stimulating platelet deposition, not produce more restenosis? Changes in arterial anatomy are likely to be important: the increase in vessel diameter and in blood flow produce conditions less favorable for thrombotic or arteriosclerotic restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade, major progress has been made in the evolution of technology directed toward the accurate measurement of regional myocardial perfusion in patients. The deficiencies of some of the older methods (thermodilution and gas clearance) are better appreciated and improved approaches (Doppler catheters, positron-emission tomography, and digital subtraction angiography) have been developed. The new approaches should play a major role in research and for most applications the older methods will gradually be replaced. Efforts to bring these new methods to community hospitals and practicing cardiologists should be stimulated. Doppler catheters, positron-emission tomography, and digital-subtraction angiography are commercially available and Doppler catheters and digital-subtraction angiography could be easily incorporated into routine cardiac catheterization procedures. The Doppler catheter is the most inexpensive and probably the simplest to apply. In our opinion, routine measurements of coronary flow reserve will significantly improve the care of patients with coronary obstructive disease and other diseases that impair myocardial perfusion. If coronary reserve measurements are used frequently, patient selection for coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery will no longer depend entirely on visual assessment of percent diameter stenosis, a very poor criterion in many situations. Also, patients with chest pain syndromes, normal coronary vessels, and impaired coronary reserve will be identified and perhaps some effective treatment for this condition will be devised.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87274013\r", 
  ".W": "During coronary angioplasty, inflation of the balloon within the coronary artery produces transient arterial occlusion and frequently results in myocardial ischemia. Delivery of oxygenated autologous blood to the myocardium at risk during inflation may help mitigate this ischemia. Accordingly, we investigated the feasibility and safety of infusing blood through the central lumen of a dilatation catheter around the guidewire using both a model in vitro and clinical trials. In the tests in vitro, fresh blood was infused at flow rates up to 120 ml/min. Hemolysis was minimal at flow rates of 60 ml/min or less (less than or equal to 0.92 +/- 0.18%), but increased exponentially at higher rates (13.64 +/- 2.37% at 120 ml/min, p less than .002). A similar pattern was observed for potassium release. Platelet and leukocyte counts did not vary significantly, and beta-thromboglobulin and muramidase remained at control levels. Although mean erythrocyte volume did not change, erythrocyte histograms and light microscopy demonstrated a subpopulation of red cell fragments averaging 25 to 40 fl in size at higher rates. A randomized, crossover clinical trial was next performed by delivery of blood perfusion at 60 ml/min to 15 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Levels of plasma hemoglobin, beta-thromboglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and potassium remained constant before and after the perfusion and the control inflations. The maximum pain score was significantly lower with the perfusion inflation (4.1 +/- 0.8 vs 6.0 +/- 0.9, p less than .003). Relative to baseline, the maximum ST segment elevation during the perfusion inflation (0.5 +/- 0.3 mm) was nearly one-fourth that during the control inflation (1.9 +/- 0.6 mm, p less than .02). Thus, myocardial protection with oxygenated autologous blood perfusion at rates of 60 ml/min appears to be a safe and effective technique that may permit increased inflation time and extend the range of coronary angioplasty to include individuals at high risk for the procedure.\r"

Patients had frequent ventricular premature depolarizations (greater than or equal to 30 VPDs/hour) and depressed cardiac function (mean ejection fraction 43 +/- 15%). Resting left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume index increased (p less than .002, p less than .001, respectively) during sotalol therapy, associated with a concomitant fall in heart rate (p less than .001). Quinidine also increased mean left ventricular ejection fraction, but less so than did sotalol (p less than .05). Quinidine significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic (p less than .05) and end-systolic (p less than .002) volumes, but had no effect on stroke volume index or heart rate. Neither drug affected cardiac index. Quinidine resulted in no symptomatic deterioration in left ventricular function or serious arrhythmia aggravation. In contrast, five patients on sotalol developed either decompensated congestive heart failure (two patients), arrhythmia aggravation (two patients), or hypotension associated with bradyarrhythmia (one patient). These patients had a unique hemodynamic profile that can be used to identify patients likely to have a poor outcome on sotalol. This profile reflected a lack of cardiac reserve, characterized by an inability to increase stroke volume and cardiac output with supine bicycle exercise.\r"

Many receive chemotherapy with little or no benefit and it would obviously be advantageous to determine in advance those patients likely to benefit. In 2 phase III trials of chemotherapy in end stage disease, 129 patients have been treated with cisplatinum, either alone or in 2-drug combination with bleomycin, methotrexate or 5-fluorouracil. Factors analysed in the entire group were age, sex, site, previous treatment, performance status and the use of cisplatinum in combination. A high albumen and oro- or nasopharyngeal site were significantly favourable, while a hypopharyngeal, middle ear, skin or paranasal site were all significantly unfavourable. In the separate analysis of the subgroup with recurrent disease, site of recurrence and time to recurrence were analysed in addition to the factors named above. Although similar trends to those in the entire group were observed none reached significant levels. In the subgroup with advanced previously untreated disease, histological grade was analysed in addition to the above factors. Good performance status emerged as significantly favourable. The emerging trends provide some insight regarding outcome but are not sufficiently clearcut to allow a decision to be made on who should and who should not be treated.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of acute renal failure (ARF) in such common conditions as acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, and primary graft anuria (ischemic transplant ARF) is poorly understood. Animal models may not exactly mimic the situation in man and thus human morphologic studies are of particular importance. Non-replacement of individual sloughed tubular cells and simplification of the brush border and basolateral infoldings of tubular cells are prominent morphologic changes which correlate with the presence of renal failure. It is possible that the initial injury inhibits cell membrane synthesis, thus interfering with proximal tubular sodium reabsorption with resulting activation of the renin angiotensin system and afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Tubular backleak, tubular obstruction by casts and debris, and decreased glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient may also play a role. Although poorly studied until now, the renal failure in primary graft anuria may have a completely different pathogenesis from that in acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis. Cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is an important component of primary graft anuria, as seen in many transplant centers in the 1980's.\r"

Syphilis, a significant cause of fetal death at the beginning of this century, has been eliminated and other conditions such as erythroblastosis fetalis and diabetes mellitus have been markedly reduced. It is clear, however, that minimum fetal mortality has not been achieved. Potentially salvagable fetuses still die from the effects of maternal hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation, and post-maturity. Widespread application of current knowledge and techniques would save some of these fetuses; others will only be saved with an increased understanding of pathological processes and their treatment. In the meantime, it is imperative that those involved in obstetrical care follow the sound principles of accurate determination of gestation age, identification of patients at risk for fetal death, meticulous care of associated medical conditions, and careful attention to the progress of pregnancy.\r"

Present knowledge raises doubts about the possibility of preventing back pain. However, recent scientific investigations indicate that chronic back pain disability, which accounts for 80% of the costs for back problems, can be prevented. In Gothenburg, Sweden, the collective use of proven treatment methods during the acute stage of back symptoms markedly reduced the period of time patients were disabled from back problems. Effective early intervention centers around: teaching patients about back care, including how to control symptoms through improved body mechanics; applying these educational principles, specifically to the patient's livelihood; avoiding the debilitation that results from overusing bed rest and medication; recommendations to increase cardiovascular fitness; and the judicious use of orthopedic surgery. This approach targets the few patients who tend to be disabled the longest, suffer the most, and become the most costly to society.\r"

Since 1970, 79 patients, ranging in age from 14 to 74 years (mean, 27 years), have had reconstruction of the knee after en bloc resection of a primary bone tumor. Sixty-one patients had lesions involving the distal femur, with a mean resection length of 13.5 cm, and 18 patients had lesions involving the proximal tibia, with a mean resection length of 10.5 cm. Thirty-nine patients had malignant lesions, of which osteosarcomas predominated, and 40 patients had benign tumors, of which giant cell tumors were the most prevalent. Reconstruction was done with a custom total knee arthroplasty in 41 patients, a resection arthrodesis in 27, and an allograft in 11. The functional results were graded according to the rating system devised by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society. of the patients with resection arthroplasty, 70% had a good or excellent rating, although ten required revision. Of the patients with resection arthrodesis, 74% had a good or excellent rating, as did 55% of the patients with osteochondral allografts. When a limb salvage procedure is done, careful consideration must be given to the type of procedure chosen to reconstruct the knee. This decision is based on a number of factors related to the tumor and the patient. Although these various procedures promise functional restoration, the reconstructive procedure should be individualized and designed to meet the needs of the patient.\r"

Nine elbows were easily redislocated in semiflexed position under anesthesia. Surgical exposure and ligament suture were performed medially in all cases and laterally in 18 cases. All the ligaments were completely ruptured or avulsed in the epicondyle attachment. In most cases the ligamentous ruptures were combined with rupture or avulsion of the muscular origins at the epicondyles.

The relation followed a power curve (correlation of t1/2 with GFR: r = -0.86; P less than 0.001). The slower elimination rate was mainly the result of lowered renal clearance of trimethoprim. The volume of distribution (Varea) was, in most patients, in the upper normal range for children. In some of the patients, chiefly infants with severe renal insufficiency, the Varea was larger than normal. In some individuals the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim deviated from that to be expected from the GRF. We recommend reduced daily doses of trimethoprim if the GFR is less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The reduction should be proportional to the reduction in GFR and primarily take the form of a prolonged dose interval.\r"

The PR interval increased 27% (P less than 0.001), QRS interval increased 10% (P less than 0.0001), QTc increased 1% (P not significant), and JTc decreased 2% (P not significant). Heart rate, blood pressure, and left ventricular performance at rest and exercise were unchanged by moricizine. Moricizine half-life was 9.2 +/- 3.4 hours. Plasma levels of moricizine decreased after 10 days of therapy, suggesting induction of metabolic enzyme systems.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty hospitalized subjects with chronic moderate to severe pain as a result of advanced cancer were enrolled in a randomized, parallel, double-blind trial comparing single doses and multiple doses of intramuscular dezocine (10 mg) with butorphanol (2 mg) and placebo. During the initial 6-hour efficacy evaluation, analgesia was measured using verbal and visual scriptors and vital signs, and acute toxicity information was recorded. Subjects with initial pain relief entered the 7-day multidose portion of the trial, and efficacy and toxicity data were recorded daily. After the initial dose the peak analgesia of the active agents was similar, but the duration of analgesia was longer with dezocine. After multiple doses, dezocine was superior to butorphanol in terms of length of treatment. Dezocine had less toxicity than had butorphanol after both single and repeated doses, further suggesting that dezocine may be beneficial in managing chronic cancer pain. The described study design is unique in that it compares the analgesic efficacy and toxicity of several analgesics with placebo after both single and multiple doses in the same subject. This method may prove to be an alternative pain model to evaluate chronic cancer pain.\r"

Meal-stimulated secretion at 7 AM (10 hours after administration) was inhibited by 28% and 39% (P less than 0.01) by only the 40 mg doses.

The response to the 5 PM meal was suppressed by the 20 and 40 mg doses given at 9 AM by 22% and 35%, respectively (P less than 0.05). Suppression was present in only eight of the subjects after the 20 mg dose but in all 10 after the 40 mg dose. The effect on basal gastric aspirate pH values paralleled those seen on acid output. An association was found between mean plasma concentrations of famotidine and mean inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion. However, individual values may not be predictive.\r"

Glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were measured by means of sodium thiosulfate and para-aminohippurate, respectively. Nicardipine increased renal blood flow by 11.5% +/- 4.3% (mean +/- SE; P less than 0.05) and glomerular filtration rate by 16.3% +/- 6.4% (P less than 0.05) and decreased total renal vascular resistance by 30.0% +/- 2.7% (P less than 0.05), with a significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared with placebo values. Nicardipine increased PRA significantly (P less than 0.05), whereas plasma aldosterone concentration remained unchanged. Our results indicate that nicardipine given in a multiple oral dosage has some favorable renal effects with a concomitant hypotensive action in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Nicardipine appears to blunt the secretion of aldosterone responding to an increased PRA possibly through its calcium-antagonizing action.\r"

  ".W": "Anti-elastase function in sputum sol-phase from patients with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1PI) deficiency was compared with sol-phase from patients with cigarette smoke-induced bronchitis and emphysema. Both alpha 1PI (2P less than 0.01) and anti-leucoprotease (ALP) (2P less than 0.01) concentrations were lower in sol-phase from the alpha 1PI-deficient group, although alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) levels were similar. There was no difference in alpha 1PI function between the two groups, but the inhibitor was only congruent to 30% active. The absolute neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitory capacity was similar in both groups (median 185 micrograms of NE inhibited/ml of sputum, range 80-480, for the alpha 1PI-deficient group; median 175, range 80-300, for the bronchitic group). A substantial proportion of NE inhibition in secretions could not be accounted for by the amount of alpha 1PI, ALP and alpha 2M present (median 74.8%, range 43.2-97.4, for alpha 1PI-deficient sol-phase; median 50.0%, range 0-80.8, for bronchitic sol-phase). Gel filtration of sol-phase demonstrated the presence of NE inhibition in the low molecular weight fractions which was markedly sensitive to changes in substrate concentration and ionic strength, in contrast to purified alpha 1PI and ALP. Sputum sol-phase from both groups failed to prevent hydrolysis of elastin-fluorescein or succinyltrialanyl-p-nitroanilide by NE completely during prolonged incubation in the presence of an excess of functional inhibitors. This was more apparent in secretions from subjects with alpha 1PI deficiency and may explain why such patients have a more rapidly progressive form of emphysema.\r"

To investigate whether this is due to alterations in energy expenditure we have studied energy expenditure in seven non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects while on metformin or sulphonylurea therapy. Three components of energy expenditure were measured by indirect calorimetry, namely resting metabolic rate and the thermic responses to infused noradrenaline and to a mixed constituent meal. There was no significant difference in the resting metabolic rate on metformin (5.29 +/- 0.41 kJ/min; mean +/- SE) compared with sulphonylurea (5.34 +/- 0.34 kJ/min). The resting metabolic rate was also similar to predicted values for non-diabetic subjects (r = 0.96). The thermic response to infused noradrenaline was similar on metformin (23.14 +/- 1.87 kJ) and sulphonylurea (21.40 +/- 2.98 kJ). There was no significant difference in the thermic response to the meal on sulphonylurea (75.8 +/- 7.5 kJ) or on metformin (86.8 +/- 10.8 kJ; 95% confidence limits -17 to +39 kJ). We conclude that in non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects metformin does not enhance energy expenditure overall, compared with sulphonylurea.\r"

In the same subjects platelet function was assessed by measuring platelet aggregation in response to adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate, thrombin, adrenaline and collagen. Platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin was also examined. Platelet noradrenaline showed a positive correlation with extent of aggregation induced by 'low-dose' collagen (1 microgram/ml). No correlation was seen at the higher collagen concentration. Platelet noradrenaline content also correlated with sensitivity of platelets to prostacyclin. High platelet noradrenaline concentrations appeared to result in decreased sensitivity to prostacyclin. No other correlations were observed. These data suggest that platelet noradrenaline rather than plasma levels may be involved in modifying platelet function in vivo. Local release of platelet catecholamines may affect the platelet/vessel wall interaction, the primary physiological step in platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "The quantification of serum drug levels provides physicians with an indication of attainment of the desired pharmacologic goals. However, based on the preceding evidence, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), which is commonly used in conjunction with the prescribing of anticonvulsants, antiarrythmics, cardiac glycosides, antibiotics, antineoplastics, bronchodilators, lithium, antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and other psychotropic drugs, is not used effectively for therapeutic intervention in the elderly. In addition to determining if a blood level is within the therapeutic range, TDM can also be helpful in identifying the reasons why a patient is not responding to a prescribed drug or is exhibiting toxic signs or symptoms, as well as in elucidating causes of coma, patient noncompliance, poor absorption, and excessively rapid metabolism. Furthermore, drug blood levels can be an asset in the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment programs for alcohol and drug abuse. Despite the existence of computerized programs for drug level determination in clinical laboratories, and the existence of individualized computer programs for optimizing the choice and dosage of drugs for many categories of patients with a multitude of metabolic and pathophysiologic problems, most physicians still rely on tradition, imitation, and information provided by drug advertising and sales representatives to choose therapeutic regimens for patients. To make proper use of TDM, a physician has to have at least a working knowledge of the basic concepts of pharmacokinetics. This advancing medical science also demands a thorough knowledge of the routes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. Results from TDM determinations indicate how effectively the appropriate amount of drug is delivered to the desired location of action from the site of administration. One of the most common reasons for misuse of TDM results is that physicians order specimens for drug monitoring to be drawn at inappropriate times. Accurate TDM requires that (most) specimens be drawn at trough levels, after steady-state levels have been attained. Trough levels occur immediately prior to the administration of the next dose. Such measurements avoid the absorptive peaking levels that occur shortly (usually) after drug administration. Steady-state levels are attained when the amount of drug absorbed and the amount excreted are essentially equal. This usually occurs after the drug has been administered for approximately five half-lives.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

It can result in decreased length of stay and improved risk management posture. The successful implementation of a TDMCS requires the coordinated efforts of a multidisciplinary team that may include physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and laboratory personnel. Clinical pathologists and clinical pharmacists are particularly well qualified to direct a TDMCS. Consistent delivery of quality services requires that all procedures related to the consultation process be standardized and documented in a procedures manual. The cost of providing the service may be recovered through both direct and indirect mechanisms.\r"

When we prospectively observed nine consecutive BMT recipients, six patients developed acute pulmonary edema associated with significant (p less than 0.05) weight gain and an increase in echocardiographically determined left ventricular end diastolic diameter. These findings led to a prospective prophylactic intervention study of 30 consecutive BMT patients. Prophylactic intervention consisting of reduced fluid volume of parenteral alimentation, and diuretic therapy was instituted at any clinical sign of fluid overload. No episode of pulmonary edema occurred. The dramatic difference--acute pulmonary edema occurred in 16/30 untreated vs 0/30 treated cases--suggests that this post-BMT complication is critically related to fluid balance and can be prevented by careful clinical examination, close monitoring of weight change, avoidance of fluid overload and the appropriate use of diuretic therapy.\r"

Thoracotomy was performed and revealed marked fibrous reaction surrounding both surfaces of each patch electrode. Histologic examination revealed fibrous tissue with multinucleated giant cells, consistent with a foreign body reaction. The patient had complete resolution of signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis after removal of the patch electrodes and pericardial stripping. Constrictive pericarditis from implanted patch electrodes appears to be an uncommon complication of the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and should be considered in patients with one or more patch electrodes and other signs of constrictive pericarditis.\r"

Eleven patients complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (three in group B, eight in group C). Thirty minutes after a standard breakfast, fasting gallbladder volumes and gallbladder emptying rates were measured using a real-time mechanical sector ultrasound scanner. Fasting gallbladder volume in diabetic patients was similar to controls (24.9 +/- 2.7 N; 28.9 +/- 3.9 A; 23.7 +/- 2.2 B; 16.7 +/- 3.4 C ml mean +/- SEM). Postprandial gallbladder emptying was not significantly different in any groups (47.4 +/- 5.1% N; 43.2 +/- 7.7% A; 50.7 +/- 7.7% B; 46.8 +/- 11.1% C). Seven diabetics and two controls had poor gallbladder emptying. One screened patient had cholecystectomy, three patients had stones, and two had sludge with a thickened gallbladder wall for a total of 12.5% gallbladder disease. These data suggest that gallbladder dysfunction in male insulin-requiring diabetics is rare.\r"

A second study showed that coadministration of a single 200- or 400-mg cimetidine tablet with the aspirin conferred the same degree of injury reduction as when cimetidine was given before the aspirin. Reduction in mucosal injury by a 200-mg cimetidine tablet, coadministered with four aspirin tablets, was then compared to placebo in a double-blind trial. A reduction of mucosal injury was observed in 14 of 20 (70%) subjects receiving cimetidine and 0 of 10 subjects receiving placebo (P less than 0.001). Two hundred milligrams of cimetidine is therefore a rational dose for further studies of the reduction of chronic aspirin-induced gastric mucosal injury.\r"

  ".W": "Arrhythmias may result from abnormalities of impulse initiation (automaticity), conduction (slow conduction, block, reentry), or a combination. The central and peripheral nervous systems have an important influence on the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias. Sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers innervate both atria and ventricle. The study of clinical cardiac arrhythmias includes the use of invasive and noninvasive testing procedures. The ECG, ambulatory monitoring, esophageal recording, exercise testing, and signal averaging techniques are the currently used noninvasive tests. Intracardiac electrophysiologic studies and endocardial catheter mapping are invasive techniques. The treatment of cardiac arrhythmias includes the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, cardiac pacing (antibradycardia, antitachycardia), implantable automatic defibrillator, cardiac fulguration, and antitachycardiac surgery. Clinical cardiac arrhythmias are of two types, the bradyarrhythmias and the tachyarrhythmias. The tachyarrhythmia, in turn, may be supraventricular or ventricular. There are clinical syndromes specifically related to arrhythmias: preexcitation syndromes are associated with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, long Q-T syndromes with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sick sinus syndrome with bradyarrhythmias. The \"tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome\" is a combination of atrial tachyarrhythmias and sinus node dysfunction (some of the patients may also have ventricular tachyarrhythmias). Specific arrhythmias are recognized by their ECG characteristics. These arrhythmias also have specific electrophysiologic features which can be defined during invasive electrophysiologic studies. Cardiac arrhythmias may or may not be accompanied by underlying organic heart disease. Their treatment is related to the specific diagnosis and mechanism of the rhythm disturbance. The presence and extent of underlying organic heart disease is an important factor in the selection of antiarrhythmic therapy (drug, pacemaker, or surgery).\r"

Bepridil produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects, in addition to negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Bepridil favorably modifies both myocardial oxygen demand and supply, supporting its use as an antianginal drug. Electrophysiologically, bepridil exhibits classes I, III, and IV antiarrhythmic activity. Five U.S. trials evaluating the short-term antianginal efficacy of bepridil collectively reported that bepridil causes significant improvement in both subjective and objective parameters of efficacy without depressing left ventricular function. In addition, one U.S. trial reported continued antianginal effects of bepridil after long-term use. There are limited data comparing and/or combining bepridil with other antianginal drugs, but the available information is promising. Limited information also exists on the use of bepridil in acute myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Tolerance to bepridil therapy has been excellent, with the most common adverse effects being diarrhea and dizziness. It is unclear whether bepridil will be used as a first-line agent in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris; however, its long half-life, which makes once daily dosing possible, is certainly a significant advantage.\r"

Successful healing of duodenal and gastric ulcers with antacids, cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, or sucralfate is frequently followed by ulcer recurrence. The need for long-term, low-dose maintenance therapy is based on disease severity, ulcer history, complications, therapeutic intervention, response to treatment, and potential risk factors. Comparison of ulcer maintenance trials requires consideration of important factors such as frequency of endoscopy, duration of follow-up period, and the method used to calculate ulcer recurrence rates. Clinical trials indicate that chronic treatment with low-dose cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and probably sucralfate decreases the frequency of duodenal ulcer recurrence and that ranitidine may be superior to cimetidine. Preliminary studies indicate that higher doses of these same medications may be required to prevent gastric ulcer recurrence. Long-term maintenance therapy with these agents must be continuous in order to prevent relapses, but treatment should be limited to one year because of unknown consequences beyond this period.\r"

Most studies have demonstrated calcium antagonists have only modest and highly variable effects on airway smooth muscle contraction. Additional studies are needed to define the effects on the inflammatory component of airways obstruction, steroid requirements in steroid-dependent patients, and on the alteration of the pharmacodynamics of other agents used for the management of chronic asthma.\r"

Included is evidence that fish oil can lower certain serum lipid levels, prolong bleeding time, and reduce systolic blood pressure when consumed in moderately large doses. Information on safety and side effects is also presented, such as a possible increase in serum cholesterol levels and annoying side effects that may severely limit widespread use of this food supplement. Presently it remains unanswered whether fish oil should be recommended as a dietary supplement for the prevention and/or treatment of hypercholesterolemia and associated coronary artery disease. Further research is required to demonstrate a clear reduction in cardiovascular mortality before a uniform recommendation can be made.\r"

Poisindex, a widely used poisoning treatment resource, recommends dosing pralidoxime chloride as an intermittent iv infusion every 8-12 hours, whereas other authors have used continuous iv infusion with good results. Available animal data suggest that a serum concentration of 4 micrograms/ml may be a minimal level to protect against the toxic effects of organophosphates. Pharmacokinetic simulations, based on parameters obtained from healthy nonpoisoned subjects, show that pralidoxime levels fall rapidly to less than 4 micrograms/ml within 1.5-2 hours after a 1-g iv bolus. Continuous iv infusion (0.5 g/h) maintains pralidoxime levels greater than 4 micrograms/ml throughout the length of infusion. We conclude that continuous iv infusion of pralidoxime chloride may be the preferred method of administration in patients with acute organophosphate poisoning. Clinical trials will be necessary to document the effectiveness of this regimen.\r"

Many such reports in the literature are based on animal experiments, or on single-dose studies in healthy subjects. Some reports are anecdotal and are unconfirmed; others are based solely on in vitro evidence. Potentially important interactions have been suggested for a relatively small group of drugs: tetracyclines, phenytoin, digoxin, chloroquine, cimetidine, quinidine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and beta-blocking agents. The evidence for these has been critically evaluated, as well as for antacid-anticoagulant and antacid-nitrofurantoin interactions that have been wrongly emphasized in the literature. The majority of literature reports on interactions with antacids have been overemphasized; only ferrous sulfate-, isoniazid-, and tetracycline-antacid interactions fall into a category I importance (scale I-III of descending importance). This category is for those interactions with good evidence of actual or potential importance in patients or in relevant studies on normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "A case of a 21-year-old woman who had developed mild hepatotoxicity while receiving choline magnesium trisalicylate therapy is described. She presented with fever and mild hepatic enzyme elevations before salicylate therapy was instituted. Liver function tests (LFT) returned to normal within five days of hospitalization but she continued to develop daily fevers. Blood, urine, and throat cultures were negative. An acute viral illness or reactivation of systemic lupus erythematosus were the suspected diagnoses. Choline magnesium trisalicylate was then administered in an effort to control her fever, and was successful. After three days of salicylate therapy her LFT values began to rise. They continued to rise for five more days before salicylate hepatotoxicity was suspected. Choline magnesium trisalicylate was discontinued after eight days and the patient's LFT quickly returned to normal. The source of fever was never identified, although infection with cytomegalovirus was considered the most likely cause. Salicylate-induced hepatotoxicity is reviewed.\r"

Exogenous LH-RH (20 micrograms) was administered intravenously every 2 hours for 48 hours to determine the effect on pituitary LH release and the hypothalamic pulse generator for LH-RH secretion. This study design was used to investigate the possibility of an ultrashort negative feedback of LH-RH upon the synthesis and release of endogenous LH-RH. A wide range of LH pulse frequencies (8 to 28 pulses/24 hours) was present in these women. There was no discernible inhibition of hypothalamic LH-RH pulse frequency during or following exogenous LH-RH administration. Mean peripheral LH levels were significantly increased during exogenous LH-RH administration (P = 0.0038), reflecting both an increased baseline and an augmented pituitary LH response to the exogenous LH-RH. There were no differences found in LH pulse amplitude before and after LH-RH treatment. These data indicate that pituitary LH secretion in women with ovarian failure can be further stimulated by exogenous LH-RH. However, there was no evidence for inhibition of either pituitary LH secretion or hypothalamic LH-RH release using this administration schedule of exogenous LH-RH.\r"

This prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken to determine whether intracervical (IC-AIH) or intrauterine (IU-AIH) homologous artificial insemination improves pregnancy rates in couples with infertility attributable to oligoasthenospermia alone. Twenty couples were randomized to receive IC-AIH or IU-AIH. Sixty-three insemination cycles were completed. During the same study period, 35 cycles with timed vaginal intercourse alone were assessed. Four pregnancies occurred, all following timed vaginal intercourse. No pregnancies resulted from IC-AIH or IU-AIH. This suggests that neither IC-AIH nor IU-AIH is of benefit when oligoasthenospermia is the cause of infertility. Pregnancies previously attributed to AIH may also have been conceived as a result of vaginal intercourse. This confounding effect on the results of AIH should always be considered.\r"

For two MoAbs, substructures of the amino acid B30 were found, which were essential for binding (hydroxyl and methyl groups of B30). In contrast to most antisera, MoAbs to human insulin show high specificity. However, as the study shows, the specificity is not absolute. With suitable artificial epitope modifications, cross-reaction can be seen. Two of the MoAbs used here show sufficient specificity to discriminate between insulin and proinsulin.\r"

Diabetes was associated with significantly increased activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD), and CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the pancreas and of CAT and GSSG-RD in the heart. On the other hand, the liver of diabetic rats showed a generalized decrease in CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and SOD as well as in the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). Diabetic kidney also showed decreases in CAT and SOD, but the activities of GSH-PX were increased. Insulin treatment (9-12 U/kg body wt) that was started after 8 wk of diabetes and continued for 4 wk reversed all of the foregoing alterations in tissue antioxidant status. Our results suggest the presence of increased oxidative stress in uncontrolled diabetes as manifested by the marked alterations in tissue antioxidant enzyme activities, the magnitude of which increased with the degree of emaciation. The complex patterns of changes observed in the various tissues examined are believed to be the result of compensatory increases in enzyme activities (usually involving enzymes whose activity in control tissues is low) and direct inhibitory effects, possibly resulting from an increased tissue-oxidant activity. Our findings support the view that tissue antioxidant status may be an important factor in the etiology of diabetes and its complications.\r"

Tumor tissue grown in diabetic mice produced more protein and basement membrane-specific proteoglycan in response to insulin than tissue grown in normal mice. Addition of high levels of glucose to the culture medium did not alter insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by diabetic or normal tissue but dampened insulin-stimulated production of proteoglycan. These data suggest that basement membrane-producing cells in diabetic hosts may be hypersensitive to insulin and that stimulation of protein production by insulin may play some role in the in situ hypertrophy of basement membranes.\r"

Myotubes were hyperpolarized by 3.5 +/- 1.2 mV (mean +/- SE). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) eliminated spontaneous twitching. With TTX, membrane potentials of myotubes became more negative both in the absence and presence of insulin, and insulin hyperpolarized myotubes by 6.6 +/- 1.7 mV, which is at least as great as the hyperpolarization this concentration of insulin produced in muscles excised from young adult rats. However, insulin did not significantly stimulate uptake of the glucose analogue 2-deoxy-D-glucose, although there was basal D-glucose transport. Specific insulin receptors were present, demonstrated by radioinsulin binding. In summary, in primary cultures of rat myotubes, there are insulin receptors, insulin hyperpolarizes at least as much as it hyperpolarizes muscle excised from young adult rats, but insulin does not stimulate D-glucose transport.\r"

However, there has been confusion regarding prostaglandin regulation of insulin secretion, partly because no mechanism has been demonstrated for the inhibitory action of PGE2 on beta-cell function. These studies were performed with a clonal cell line of glucose-responsive beta-cells (HIT cells) to determine whether PGE2 effects on insulin secretion are receptor mediated and, if so, whether the postreceptor effects are mediated by inhibitory regulatory components (Ni) of adenylate cyclase. Saturable [3H]PGE2 binding to HIT cells was demonstrated. This binding was dissociable and specific for prostaglandins of the E series. Scatchard analyses of binding data indicated a single class of sites with a Kd of approximately 1 X 10(-9) M. Guinea pig islets were also demonstrated to have a single class of binding sites with a similar Kd but only 22% as many binding sites (0.060 vs. 0.013 pmol/mg protein, HIT cells vs. guinea pig islet). HIT cells were demonstrated to synthesize PGE2, and this synthesis was inhibitable by acetylsalicylic acid. Accumulation of cAMP by HIT cells was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by PGE2 with an IC50 of approximately 1 X 10(-9) M. Insulin secretion by HIT cells during static incubations with 11.1 mM glucose was also inhibited by PGE2 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 1 X 10(-9) M. PGE2 was more potent than epinephrine but less potent than somatostatin in this regard. Maximum inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion was 26, 37, and 29% of control values for somatostatin, PGE2, and epinephrine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When acini were incubated with 0-100 nM insulin for 2 h and then pulsed with [35S]methionine, a dose-dependent increase in [35S]methionine incorporation into total cellular proteins was observed. When acinar cell lysates were subjected to gel electrophoresis, 12 major newly synthesized protein bands were resolved. Insulin (100 nM) increased the incorporation of [35S]methionine into all bands but with significantly different rates, varying from 84 to 216% of control. Next, specific antibodies to amylase, trypsin, ribonuclease, myosin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were used to evaluate the biosynthesis of known proteins. Insulin stimulated labeled amino acid incorporation into amylase by 148% over control. Insulin stimulated the synthesis of trypsinogen to a similar degree, but ribonuclease synthesis showed a significantly smaller increase of 53% over control. Insulin stimulated myosin and LDH synthesis by 169 and 184%, respectively. A differential pattern of protein synthesis was also observed when acini were treated with two other stimulators of protein synthesis, cholecystokinin and hemin. Both of these stimulators had a reduced effect on ribonuclease synthesis compared with amylase and trypsinogen synthesis but failed to increase myosin synthesis. When the RNAs extracted from control acini and acini treated with 100 nM insulin were translated in vitro, the proteins synthesized were quantitatively similar. This study therefore indicates that insulin has translational effects on acinar protein synthesis, and these effects are nonparallel for various specific acinar cell proteins.\r"

Normalization of hyperglycemia was sustained from approximately 10 days for the implant with 6% insulin content and to 24 +/- 5 days for 8-10% insulin in the composition. Insulin content up to 50% resulted in hypoglycemia and shorter implant service life. Not all of the pellet disks prepared were active, especially those with 3% insulin content. However, when broken further into 1-mm3 chips, all became active, with onset of action in less than 2 h, and the extent of hyperglycemia reduction was reproducible. Three successive subcutaneous insertions of approximately 80 mg chips with 10% insulin maintained normoglycemia for 2.5 mo. Because the implant materials are constituents of tissue, no biocompatibility problem is expected.\r"

The study involved the histologic, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopic evaluation of a total of 47 gastric biopsy, polypectomy, and resection specimens and showed that the gastric lymphatics normally begin as a plexus of vessels immediately superficial to, within, and below the muscularis mucosae. The upper two-thirds of the gastric lamina propria is normally devoid of lymphatics. This distribution is maintained throughout the cardia, fundus, and antrum and is also maintained in hyperplastic and neoplastic tissues. However, in patients with severe atrophic gastritis in which the overall height of the gastric mucosa is markedly decreased, lymphatic capillaries may be found near the surface epithelium. The relevance of these findings to the behavior of early gastric cancer is discussed.\r"

We conducted a double-blind randomized hemodynamic evaluation of the effects of placebo and 10 mg and 20 mg isosorbide dinitrate in stable individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis. Baseline values for all three groups were similar. Isosorbide dinitrate resulted in a peak reduction of the hepatic venous gradient of 24.7% +/- 3.0%, with significantly decreased values 4 h after the administration of the 20-mg dose. A reduction of arterial pressure and cardiac index (peak decrease of 25.7% +/- 1.5%) was well tolerated by 13 of 15 patients. Changes in mean arterial pressure were not predictive of modifications in the hepatic vein wedge pressure. There was no relation between the area under the plasma isosorbide dinitrate concentration curve and hemodynamic changes. Levels of isosorbide-5-mononitrate, a vasoactive metabolite, were detectable for an 8-h period. Isosorbide dinitrate significantly reduced portal pressure in stable cirrhotics, in association with systemic hemodynamic changes. Thus, titration of isosorbide dinitrate is required to maximize hemodynamic benefits in individual patients. As the decrease in portal pressure is more predictable than the effect of previously tested pharmacologic agents, isosorbide dinitrate should be evaluated for its efficacy in the management of portal hypertension.\r"

Changes of portal hemodynamics after transcatheter hepatic artery embolization were also investigated in 15 of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The duplex system showed that 9 of the 55 had no Doppler signal in the portal trunk, suggesting portal vein thrombosis, 2 had hepatofugal flow in the portal trunk indicative of arterioportal shunts, and 44 had hepatopetal flow in the portal trunk. One of the 9 patients with no significant portal venous flow showed hepatopetal flow in collateral veins at the porta hepatis, suggesting cavernous transformation of the portal vein. All of these ultrasound findings were confirmed by subsequent celiac-mesenteric angiography. In 44 of the 55 patients there was no tumor invasion in the portal trunk, and portal venous flow was found to be close to that of normal subjects regardless of the stage or size of tumor, and tumor invasion into relatively large portal branches. After transcatheter hepatic artery embolization, portal venous flow was increased, even on the next day, and it remained increased for at least 2 wk. Thus, the duplex system is useful to study qualitative and quantitative changes of portal hemodynamics in hepatocellular carcinoma. Our observations suggest that the portal venous flow is kept relatively constant by some homeostatic mechanism even in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma until the tumor invades into the portal trunk, and that it increases when hepatic arterial flow is occluded.\r"

  ".W": "A double-blind, controlled trial to study the efficacy of acidifying enemas of lactitol, a new galactoside-sorbitol disaccharide, and lactose vs. nonacidifying tap-water enemas was performed in 45 episodes of acute portal-systemic encephalopathy. At the time of randomization, all patients had encephalopathy of at least Grade 2+ severity, delay in the performance of number connection tests and hyperammonemia. A sequential analysis was performed which revealed after the inclusion of the first 20 patients, a significant failure of the nonacidifying enemas as compared to the lactitol enemas (p less than 0.004). The tap-water enema group was, therefore, suspended but the rest of the study continued after rerandomization for lactose and lactitol groups. A favorable response to treatment was obtained in 19 (86%) of the patients receiving lactitol enemas and in 14 (78%) of those receiving lactose enemas. A similar significant improvement in portal-systemic encephalopathy parameters and index was observed after both treatments. Both types of acidifying enemas induced a significant pH decrease in stool (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that acidifying agents like lactose and lactitol are effective and superior to tap-water enemas for the treatment of acute nitrogenous portal-systemic encephalopathy.\r"

Liver connective tissue cells showed the lowest rate of migration into the gel and the highest speed of gel contraction, reflecting their high adhesiveness to the substrate as compared to the other cell lines studied. The analysis of their ultrastructural morphology showed that liver connective tissue cells and smooth muscle cells developed cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic organelle polarities, in response to the contact with gel surface. This polarity was lost when cells were embedded in the gel. Skin fibroblasts did not show this characteristic, neither on top nor in the gel. Although liver connective tissue cells have been recognized as analogous to smooth muscle cells, they represent a defined cell population, present in fibrotic livers, with specific behavior and with particular relationship to the extracellular matrix.\r"

For this purpose, agalactoorosomucoid, ahexosaminoorosomucoid and horseradish peroxidase were used as ligands. A reliable determination of the amount of ligand endocytosed in vivo or in vitro was made possible by using the recently developed cold pronase method for the isolation and purification of Kupffer and endothelial cells. Both cell types participated in the uptake of the ligands in vivo as well as in vitro, but their endocytic capacity was several times greater in vivo than in vitro. Under both conditions, endothelial cells possessed a greater capacity to endocytose the ligands than did Kupffer cells. Since the total number of endothelial cells in the liver is at least twice the number of Kupffer cells, the contribution of endothelial cells to the liver uptake of N-acetylglucosamine-terminated glycoproteins in vivo was estimated to be 3 to 7 times higher than that of the Kupffer cells. In vitro experiments showed that the uptake of the glycoproteins followed saturation kinetics and was strongly inhibited at 4 degrees C and in the presence of mannan. Ultrastructural investigations revealed that horseradish peroxidase was taken up by all Kupffer and endothelial cells. These results emphasize the important role liver endothelial cells play in the clearance of specific glycoproteins from the circulation.\r"

Thirty-two patients received treatment (6 for 3 months, 26 for 6 months), and 9 patients were controls (received no treatment). Ninety-three per cent of our patients were homosexual, and 41% had anti-HTLV-III in their serum. None of the control patients lost HBeAg. In contrast, six of the anti-HTLV-III-negative patients (33%) responded to treatment (p less than 0.02): five of these responders were homosexual (p less than 0.05). The response rate was greatest (44%) in the anti-HTLV-III-negative patients who received 10 mU per m2 of recombinant interferon-alpha 2A. None of the anti-HTLV-III-positive patients responded to treatment. The percentage reduction of hepatitis B virus DNA was significantly less in the anti-HTLV-III-positive group in comparison to the anti-HTLV-III-negative group at 1 and 4 months of treatment and at 3 months after the end of treatment (p less than 0.05). These patients were younger (33 vs. 42 years, p less than 0.02), had lower mean baseline AST values (42 vs. 80 IU per liter, p less than 0.02) and tended to have milder histological disease. Homosexual men with HBeAg-positive chronic liver disease who are anti-HTLV-III-positive appear to be less responsive to the direct antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of recombinant interferon-alpha 2A. This may be due to the subclinical immunosuppressive effects of co-infection with HTLV-III.\r"

The possible cell-surface localization of the primary biliary cirrhosis antigens was further investigated using an indirect immunofluorescent technique on a number of different mammalian cells. Rat hepatoma cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes stained positively with primary biliary cirrhosis sera, but not with normal sera or primary biliary cirrhosis sera preabsorbed with beef heart mitochondria. However, blood cells from primary biliary cirrhotic patients gave positive immunofluorescence in all tests, which is compatible with prior binding of the patients' own antimitochondrial antibodies to the surface of the cells.\r"

  ".W": "The attempt to divide the large group of chronic HBsAg carriers into \"healthy\" vs. those with chronic hepatitis of various intensities is sometimes difficult. The major problems are overlap in clinical manifestations, hepatic test results and histologic as well as virologic features. Nevertheless, this separation is not only conceptually important, but may also be useful in patient management, particularly because of the risk of transition to cirrhosis and HCC. Although at least 75% of patients with HCC associated with HBV have cirrhosis, the time point at which the cirrhosis developed is not established, particularly since the vast majority of chronic HBsAg carriers fall into the \"healthy\" category. Important unanswered questions are, therefore: how often do \"healthy\" carriers develop cirrhosis and/or HCC, including the time relations between the two? Does the transformation to HCC result from one or several identifiable acute events in the \"healthy\" carrier (or in mild CPH) or is it a gradual process of progressing chronic hepatitis B in which intercurrent exacerbations may still play a role? Do the quantitative observations as to the relation between persistent HBV infections and HCC in the East apply to Western countries? Our hypothesis concerning pathogenesis is based on pathologic, molecular, clinical and epidemiologic observations and concepts, and is supported by studies of hepadna virus-infected animals. This thesis proposes that integration of HBV DNA into host chromosomes in acute or chronic hepatitis or during the \"healthy\" carrier state corresponds to an initiation event similar to that described in chemical carcinogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The reduced arterial compliance acts to maintain systolic pressure and end-systolic stress, thus contributing to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Since cardiac output remains within the normal range in the hypertrophied hypertensive heart, elevated left ventricular pressures, and therefore increased cardiac filling pressures, are necessary if an adequate stroke volume is to be maintained. In hypertensive persons, reduced venous compliance acts to maintain the filling pressure of the heart in the presence of reduced intravascular volume. In patients with hypertension, even if compliance changes have been initiated by the elevated blood pressure itself, the reduced arterial and venous compliance observed in cross-sectional studies is not simply the mechanical consequence of the elevated blood pressure, but also reflects intrinsic alterations of the vascular wall. Consequently, blood pressure reduction caused by antihypertensive agents is not constantly associated with a reversion of the decreased vascular compliance. Such observations may be of importance in the consideration of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients treated for hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Characterization of the renal effects of calcium entry blockers has not been easy because the inhibition of Ca2+ cellular influx alters several regulatory functions. The ability of calcium blockers to dilate renal vasculature and to increase glomerular filtration rate is largely determined by the preexisting vascular tone. However, the increments in sodium excretion could occur without alterations in renal hemodynamics. Calcium blockers could increase sodium excretion by inducing a redistribution of renal blood flow toward juxtamedullary nephrons, by inhibiting tubuloglomerular feedback responses, or by a direct action on the tubular transport of sodium. These effects are poorly understood at present. In vitro studies show that the blockade of calcium entry enhances renin secretion and decreases prostaglandin synthesis. This dissociation has not been found during long-term administration, which has been proved to be effective for the treatment of essential hypertension with normal maintenance of renal function. In this respect, there are reports indicating that calcium blockers are particularly effective in a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension who exhibit subtle but detectable alterations in calcium metabolism. Further studies are needed to determine whether this significant response to calcium blockers is due to correction of an early defect of calcium cellular kinetics that initiated the increase in blood pressure.\r"

In addition, intracerebroventricular infusion of the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide (20 micrograms/min) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid vehicle significantly increased aldosterone levels to 144 +/- 14% of basal level and decreased PRA to 62 +/- 5% of basal value. Neither intracerebroventricular infusion of the vehicle nor intravenous infusions of metoclopramide or dopamine at the same doses changed aldosterone or PRA levels. Intracerebroventricular bolus injections of metoclopramide (20 micrograms/kg in 0.4 ml of vehicle) were also effective, increasing aldosterone levels to 266 +/- 22% of basal level and decreasing PRA to 70 +/- 12% of basal level. Intravenous bolus injections of the same dose of metoclopramide were ineffective. Dopamine was infused intracerebroventricularly into two uniadrenalectomized sheep with the remaining adrenal transplanted to the neck. Aldosterone levels were decreased to 49 +/- 10% of basal level, and PRA was increased to 157 +/- 10% of basal value. None of the infusions or injections changed arterial or intracranial pressure, or plasma K, Na, and cortisol levels. These data indicate that endogenous or exogenous dopamine may act on central dopamine receptors to decrease plasma aldosterone concentration by an unknown humoral mechanism. The known aldosterone regulators, plasma Na, K, angiotensin II, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, are not involved in the regulation.\r"

To determine if volume depletion augments this response, we compared the effects of captopril, furosemide, and combined furosemide plus captopril on individual kidney computer-derived clearances of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and [131I]o-iodohippurate in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats and normal controls. In clipped kidneys, captopril reduced DTPA clearance significantly from baseline (from 0.31 +/- 0.02 to 0.19 +/- 0.04 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.02) whereas furosemide alone had no effect (0.28 +/- 0.03 ml/min/100 g). Combined furosemide plus captopril further reduced clipped kidney DTPA clearance to a level significantly less than captopril alone (0.10 +/- 0.02 ml/min/100 g; p less than 0.02). Clipped kidney o-iodohippurate clearance was not changed from baseline by any treatment. In contralateral unclipped and normal kidneys, DTPA clearance did not decline from baseline following either captopril or furosemide plus captopril treatment. Since the dose of captopril used (3 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection) did not reduce systolic blood pressure of hypertensive rats significantly, these changes probably reflect intrarenal rather than systemic hemodynamic effects of converting enzyme inhibition and are consistent with the hypothesis that captopril interferes with glomerular filtration in stenotic kidneys by reducing efferent arteriolar vascular resistance. Prior volume depletion accentuates the effect of captopril on stenotic kidney glomerular filtration rate, providing improved functional discrimination of stenotic kidneys from contralateral unclipped and normal kidneys. These results indicate that furosemide-induced volume depletion may increase the diagnostic sensitivity of captopril-enhanced 99mTc-DTPA renography in the detection of unilateral renovascular hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine may be a physiological modulator of vascular smooth muscle tone, sympathetic neurotransmission, renin release, and renal and cardiac function. To facilitate the elucidation of the physiological role of adenosine, a microassay for adenosine was developed that allows accurate quantitation of adenosine in 75 microliters of rat plasma, thus permitting multiple determinations of plasma adenosine levels in an individual rat without inducing hemodynamic perturbations due to blood loss. The technique employs a simple and rapid extraction of plasma with a reverse-phase Sep-Pak cartridge and exploits the increased mass sensitivity of microbore high performance liquid chromatography. The assay was verified by demonstrating a linear relationship between the amount of adenosine added to plasma and the amount detected by the assay, a linear relationship between the rate of adenosine infusion into rats and plasma adenosine levels, and the absence of measurable adenosine levels in plasma incubated with adenosine deaminase. The mean arterial plasma level of adenosine in the anesthetized rat was determined to be 119 +/- 28 (SD) ng/ml (n = 10). With the use of this assay, renal venous plasma levels of adenosine were found to be elevated sixfold in two-kidney, one clip Goldblatt hypertensive rats (1 week postclipping) compared with sham-operated controls. Given the known effects of adenosine on renin release, these data support a role for endogenous adenosine as a regulator of renin release in renovascular hypertension.\r"

In these patients, however, a functional impairment of the kidney ipsilateral to the stenosis can often be detected after ACE inhibition by scintigraphic techniques employing glomerular radionuclide tracers like 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). Dynamic renal scintigraphy with 99mTc-DTPA before and 1 hour after administration of captopril, 25 mg (renal scintigraphic captopril test; RSCT), was performed in a selected series of 39 hypertensive subjects with suspected renovascular hypertension. Changes in glomerular filtration rate induced by captopril on the individual kidney were estimated by assessing the early (120-180 seconds) DTPA uptake by the kidney. Values were expressed as the ratio between the kidney with the lower uptake and the contralateral one in 34 patients and as the ratio of the kidney counts to the injected dose in five patients with solitary kidneys, aortic coarctation, or both. Compared with precaptopril values, postcaptopril uptake decreased markedly in 14 subjects (-62.42 +/- 30.94 [SD]%; range, -25 to -100%) and decreased modestly or even increased in the other 25 (+0.57 +/- 9.83%; range, +28 to -13%). Of the 14 subjects considered to be RSCT-positive diagnostic workup revealed either established (10) or strongly suspected (2) renal artery stenosis in 12 and aortic coarctation in 2 subjects. In another patient with established renovascular hypertension, results of the RSCT were negative when performed in the supine position but became positive when repeated in the sitting position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We assessed hemodynamics, lobar perfusion, and shunts at base line 1.5 h after unilobar oleic acid edema, 15 min after indomethacin (10 mg/kg iv), and 15 min after positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (10 cm) in 10 dogs. In 10 additional dogs (control) the same measurements were made but no indomethacin was administered. Shunts of the edematous lobe were: 10.6 +/- 6.3, 54.1 +/- 22.8, 30.8 +/- 16.6, and 12.4 +/- 6.3% for dogs administered indomethacin and 10.9 +/- 4.2, 53.8 +/- 13.1, 72.3 +/- 14.6, and 11.5 +/- 4.1% for the controls. Perfusions (% cardiac output) to the edematous lobe were 27.6 +/- 3.6, 14.6 +/- 2.0, 9.9 +/- 1.5, and 27.9 +/- 2.9% in the dogs administered indomethacin and 27.3 +/- 3.1, 14.0 +/- 1.7, 13.2 +/- 1.3, and 26.9 +/- 2.8% in controls. The decrease in lobar perfusion was similar before indomethacin with a further decrease in lobar perfusion and an increase in lobar vascular resistance 15 min after indomethacin. The increase in vascular resistance of the edematous lobe was three times that of nonedematous lobes after indomethacin (149.6 +/- 76% vs. 58.0 +/- 43%). Indomethacin, therefore, decreases shunt possibly by enhancing alveolar hypoxic vasoconstriction and does not block the improvement in shunt with PEEP.\r"

  ".W": "Since pulmonary blood flow to regions involved in adult respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) is reduced by hypoxic vasoconstriction, compression by cuffs of edema, and local thromboses, we postulated that the bronchial circulation must enlarge to provide for the inflammatory response. We measured anastomotic bronchial systemic to pulmonary blood flow [QBr(s-p)] serially in a lung lobe in 31 open-chest dogs following a generalized lobar injury simulating ARDS. The pulmonary circulation of the weighed left lower lobe (LLL) was isolated and perfused (zone 2) with autologous blood in anesthetized dogs. QBr(s-p) was measured from the amount of blood which overflowed from this closed vascular circuit corrected by any changes in the lobe weight. The LLL was ventilated with 5% CO2 in air. The systemic blood pressure (volume infusion), gases, and acid-base status (right lung ventilation) were kept constant. We injured the LLL via the airway by instilling either 0.1 N HCl or a mixture of glucose and glucose oxidase or via the pulmonary vessels by injecting either alpha-naphthylthiourea or oleic acid into the LLL pulmonary artery. In both types of injury, there was a prompt rise in QBr(s-p) (mean rise = 247% compared with control), which was sustained for the 2 h of observation. The cause of this increase in flow was studied. Control instillation of normal saline into the airways or into the pulmonary vessels did not change QBr(s-p) nor did a similar increase in lobar fluid (weight) due to hydrostatic edema. Neither cardiac output nor systemic blood pressure increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the autonomic innervation to myoepithelial cells of submucosal gland, we applied electrical field stimulation (FS) to the intrinsic nerves in isolated submucosal glands from feline tracheae. FS induced contraction that was voltage or frequency dependent and abolished by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin. DMPP (1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide) did not produce any significant contraction, and pretreatment with hexamethonium did not alter the response to FS. Atropine inhibited the contractile response to FS and neostigmine augmented the response to FS. Serotonin also augmented the response to FS, whereas the response to methacholine remained unchanged in the presence of serotonin. Phentolamine reduced the response to FS by 15% of control, whereas propranolol induced no significant changes in the response to FS. No significant inhibitory responses were observed by FS. Our findings indicate that the contraction of tracheal submucosal glands is mediated mainly by cholinergic nerves via muscarinic receptors and in small part by adrenergic nerves via alpha-receptors, and serotonin potentiates the contractile response to FS at the postganglionic nerve.\r"

The results were analysed, and the patient's age, any delay between injury and suture, and the duration of follow-up were all found to exert strong and consistent effects on the scores obtained. After controlling for these factors, there was no consistent difference between the results of the two surgical methods.

In 27 patients, comparable areas of second-degree wounds on the same patient were selected at random for test and control (silver sulfadiazine 1% only) sites. The mean total time of the synthetic dressing application per patient was about nine days, and each dressing remained in place for nearly four days. During this interval the control sites required four dressings changes. In 17 tests for infections, the control areas were contaminated but no bacteria were detected under the synthetic dressing; in three tests, the controls had no bacteria, whereas the synthetic dressing did. Healing of burns was similar under both types of dressing. Benefits of Hydron treatment included increased patient comfort because of the reduced number of dressing changes and, in some cases, greater freedom from contaminating bacteria.\r"

Chylomicrons, isolated from a chylothorax, chylomicron remnants, hypertriglyceridemic very low-density lipoproteins, normotriglyceridemic very low-density lipoproteins (NTG-VLDL), their remnants, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and HDL-E (an Apo E-rich high-density lipoprotein isolated from the plasma of a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis) were bound by high-affinity receptors. Chylomicron remnants and HDL-E were bound with the highest affinity. The results, obtained from competitive binding experiments, are consistent with the existence of two distinct receptors on Hep G2 cells: (a) a remnant receptor capable of high-affinity binding of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and HDL-E, but not of Apo E free LDL, and (b) a LDL receptor capable of high-affinity binding of LDL, NTG-VLDL, and HDL-E. Specific binding of Apo E-free LDL was completely abolished in the presence of 3 mM EDTA, indicating that binding to the LDL receptor is calcium dependent. Specific binding of chylomicron remnants was not inhibited by the presence of even 10 mM EDTA. Preincubation of the Hep G2 cells in lipoprotein-containing medium resulted in complete suppression of LDL receptors but did not affect the remnant receptors. Hep G2 cells seem to be a suitable model for the study of hepatic receptors for lipoprotein in man.\r"

M value was significantly correlated with capillary density (r = 0.63; P less than or equal to 0.0001), percent type I fibers (r = 0.29; P less than 0.02), and percent type 2B fibers (r = -0.38; P less than 0.003). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with capillary density (r = -0.46, P less than or equal to 0.0001; r = -0.47, P less than or equal to 0.0001, respectively). Waist circumference/thigh circumference ratio was correlated with percent type 1 fibers (r = -0.39; P less than 0.002). These results suggest that diffusion distance from capillary to muscle cells or some associated biochemical change, and fiber type, could play a role in determining in vivo insulin action. The association of muscle fiber type with body fat distribution may indicate that central obesity is only one aspect of a more generalized metabolic syndrome. The data may provide at least a partial explanation for the insulin resistance associated with obesity and for the altered kinetics of insulin action in the obese.\r"

Each subject was studied four times; during infusion of placebo, propranolol, somatostatin, and a control study where hypoglycemia was prevented. Hypoglycemia induced an insulin resistance with a lower steady state glucose infusion rate following the hypoglycemia during placebo as compared to the control study (2.5 +/- 0.5 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 mg/kg min, respectively, P less than 0.05). The insulin resistance was due to an attenuated insulin effect on both inhibition of Ra (impaired by 37%) and stimulation of Rd (impaired by 61%). The insulin-antagonistic effect was completely prevented by propranolol but only partly by somatostatin. Thus, early posthypoglycemic insulin resistance (2.5-3.5 h after hypoglycemia) is a sustained effect mainly due to beta-adrenergic stimulation.\r"

In the in situ blood-perfused rat mesentery, in normal rats exogenous AII potentiated mesenteric vascular responses to periarterial (sympathetic) nerve stimulation (PNS) more than vascular responses to exogenous norepinephrine (NE). In 2-kidney-1-clip (2K-1C) rats with renovascular hypertension mesenteric vascular responses to PNS and NE were greater than in sham-operated rats, and renovascular hypertension mimicked the effects of exogenous AII with respect to enhancing responses to PNS more than responses to NE. In 2K-1C rats, but not in sham-operated rats, 1-Sar-8-Ile-AII markedly suppressed vascular responses to PNS, without influencing responses to NE. Finally, 1-Sar-8-Ile-AII attenuated sympathetic nerve stimulation-induced neuronal spillover of NE in 2K-1C rats, but not in sham-operated rats. These data indicate that renovascular hypertension enhances noradrenergic neurotransmission, and that this enhancement is mediated in part by AII-induced facilitation of NE release.\r"

We have demonstrated the Lp(a) glycoprotein directly in human sera by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions after immunoblotting using anti-Lp(a) serum and have observed inter- and intraindividual size heterogeneity of the glycoprotein with apparent molecular weights ranging from approximately 400,000-700,000 D. According to their relative mobilities compared with apo B-100 Lp(a) patterns were categorized into phenotypes F (faster than apo B-100), B (similar to apo B-100), S1, S2, S3, and S4 (all slower than apo B-100), and into the respective double-band phenotypes. Results from neuraminidase treatment of isolated Lp(a) glycoprotein indicate that the phenotypic differences do not reside in the sialic acid moiety of the glycoprotein. Family studies are compatible with the concept that Lp(a) glycoprotein phenotypes are controlled by a series of autosomal alleles (Lp[a]F, Lp[a]B, Lp[a]S1, Lp[a]S2, Lp[a]S3, Lp[a]S4, and Lp[a]0) at a single locus. Comparison of Lp(a) plasma concentrations in different phenotypes revealed a highly significant association of phenotype with concentration. Phenotypes B, S1, and S2 are associated with high and phenotypes S3 and S4 with low Lp(a) concentrations. This suggests that the same gene locus is involved in determining Lp(a) glycoprotein phenotypes and Lp(a) lipoprotein concentrations in plasma and is the first indication for structural differences underlying the quantitative genetic Lp(a)-trait.\r"

Complexes made with purified guinea pig antiinsulin IgG2 (cytophilic isotype) were rapidly cleared by the liver whereas those made with IgG1 remained in the plasma, as did 123I-labeled IgG1 or IgG2 of control animals. Hepatic clearance of insulin-antiinsulin IgG complexes was not inhibited by either an excess of insulin or decomplementation, thereby ruling out interaction with insulin and C3b receptors. Insulin and guinea pig antiinsulin serum or its purified IgG isotypes formed large aggregates exceeding 5 IgG. Antiinsulin antibodies of diabetics, mostly IgG1 and IgG3 (cytophilic isotypes), formed complexes that either remained in plasma (small aggregates) or were cleared by the liver (large aggregates). In conclusion, clearance of insulin-antiinsulin IgG complexes is probably mediated by Fc gamma receptors on macrophages and requires cytophilic subclass composition and formation of large IgG aggregates.\r"

Dose-response curves indicated variations in the sensitivity of monocytes and granulocytes to these mediators. These increases were independent of protein synthesis and half-maximal at 2 min. Human alveolar and murine peritoneal macrophages, cells that had previously diapedised, could not be induced to upregulate Mac-1 or p150,95. Detergent permeabilization studies in monocytes indicated that these proteins were stored in internal latent pools, which were reduced upon stimulation. Electron microscopy utilizing rabbit antiserum against p150,95 revealed these proteins on the plasma membrane, and in intracellular vesicles and peroxidase negative granules. Together with other functional studies, these findings suggest that the mobilization of Mac-1 and p150,95 from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane regulates the monocyte's ability to adhere and diapedese.\r"

At the end of each period isolated fat cells were prepared from subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and incubated in vitro in the absence or presence of adenosine deaminase, either alone or in combination with various lipolytic or antilipolytic hormones and agents. Variations in total energy intake and dietary composition had characteristic and specific effects on fat cell lipolysis in vitro. High carbohydrate and prudent diets resulted in low rates of nonstimulated glycerol release and impaired insulin action in the presence of adenosine deaminase (320 mU/ml). High-fat and energy restricted diets were characterized by high rates of nonstimulated glycerol release. Sensitivity of antilipolysis to insulin and prostaglandin E2 was 10 to 200 times lower respectively on energy-restricted than on fat-rich diets. The effects of alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic catecholamines and of N6-phenylisopropyladenosine were not affected by the preceding diets.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on hematopoietic reconstitution after autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a primate model. Animals were given a continuous intravenous infusion of recombinant human GM-CSF for several days both before and after transplantation or only after the transplant procedure. Marrow ablation was accomplished by total body irradiation. In both groups of animals, the neutrophil count reached 1,000/mm3 by 8-9 d posttransplant compared with an interval of 17 and 24 d for two concurrent controls. After withdrawal of GM-CSF, neutrophil counts fell to values comparable to those observed in untreated controls. Accelerated recovery of platelet production was also observed in four of the five animals. Two additional animals were initially given GM-CSF several weeks posttransplantation because of inadequate engraftment. Prompt and sustained increases in neutrophil and platelet counts were observed. We conclude that GM-CSF may be useful in accelerating bone marrow reconstitution.\r"

It also reacted with smooth muscle throughout the body and, in specific sites, with those mesenchymal cells known as myofibroblasts. It did not react with cardiac or skeletal muscle, nor with fibroblasts. PR 2D3 is an IgG1 antibody and identifies a membrane component of about 140 K molecular weight. The pericrypt cells have been described as fibroblasts, but in view of the specificity of PR 2D3 for smooth muscle, and its selective staining of the colonic pericrypt cells, this cell type was re-examined for other smooth muscle properties. Ultrastructurally, the cells had many characteristics in common with smooth muscle and were identical with the myofibroblasts of the umbilical cord. On immunocytochemical examination they were found to contain desmin, myosin, and filamin. The confirmation that the pericrypt cells are myofibroblasts suggest that they have both contractile and secretory roles.\r"

The concentrations fell after conditioning treatment, and recovered when the marrow was transplanted. Bacterial infection did not influence B2M concentration, but nine of 22 episodes of acute graft versus host disease were associated with raised concentrations. Increased plasma B2M concentrations were also a feature of eight episodes of chronic graft versus host disease, and these fell after treatment. Reactivation of herpes simplex, varicella zoster, or cytomegalovirus infections were also accompanied by raised B2M concentrations. Three patients with cytomegalovirus pneumonitis had high concentrations of plasma B2M, the rise starting between five and 22 days before onset of symptoms. Although it is non-specific, serial measurement of plasma B2M in patients undergoing BMT may be clinically useful in monitoring chronic graft versus host disease.\r"

  ".W": "A practical, transferable microcomputer system for differential diagnosis in dermatopathology, called TEGUMENT, has been developed for use by dermatologists on the standard IBM PC, Compaq, and other compatible personal microcomputers. In an interactive computer program a set of information is abstracted from the microscopic study of each specimen by a dermatologist, to compare with a structured knowledge base. The process leads through a relevant sequence of descriptive phrases until the findings can be allocated to a disease class. The microscopic description and diagnosis are then combined with clinical information by the computer and printed, optionally, as a pathology report. The identification and diagnosis of each case are preserved in permanent memory to enable future search and sorting. The results of independent validation are that a pathologist made the same diagnosis as the machine or a similar differential diagnosis in 91.8%, disagreed in 4.8%, and was unable to make a diagnosis from the description furnished by the machine in 3.4% of 147 actual cases. We conclude that a certain critical minimum of information is required for objective diagnosis; more information is needed for definitive than for differential diagnosis; a characteristic feature is necessary to distinguish between differential diagnoses; an objective description may admit of more than one diagnosis; ambiguity may be reduced by presenting for consideration all distinguishing features that characterize closely related diagnoses; and the personal microcomputer, programmed in this way, is of considerable assistance to the dermatologist in the histopathologic diagnosis of diseases and neoplasms of the skin.\r"

Eleven patients participated and responded, with an average of 4.2 cm2 clearing about the injection site in the treated lesions, in comparison with no improvement in the control lesions. We injected 1 ml of fluorouracil (50 mg/ml) to form an intradermal wheal of about 0.8 cm2. Each patient received one to three injections at 1- to 2-week intervals, with an average of two injections per patient. The earliest signs of improvement occurred at 2 weeks; maximum clearing was achieved usually about 4 weeks after treatment began. At 3-month follow-up, four of the nine patients who had favorable response to treatment remained substantially in remission. Toxic effects were limited to local hyperpigmentation in seven patients, slight irritation in two patients, and moderate irritation in one patient. No systemic toxic effects were shown. Weekly pulse doses of fluorouracil given intralesionally instead of topically can greatly speed up response to therapy and can produce similarly good results. Intralesional administration of fluorouracil is locally effective, is often of long-term benefit, and can be tolerated well.\r"

Thirty-nine patients completed this 18-month study comprising two birch pollen seasons. The patients received enterosoluble capsules daily, and the actively treated patients reached a cumulated dose of 280 times 10(6) biologic units of birch pollen extract, which is about 200 times higher than the dose used in conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy. We found a significant decrease in eye symptom scores and conjunctival sensitivity to birch pollen, as determined by conjunctival provocation test, as well as a numerical but nonsignificant decrease in nasal symptom scores, nasal sensitivity as determined by nasal provocation test, and antiallergic medication. The treatment was safe, and only a few slight side effects were observed. We thus conclude that our study demonstrates a clinical effect of oral immunotherapy in birch pollinosis.\r"

Except for one patient receiving placebo who developed mildly elevated liver function tests, there were no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests associated with injections. By Student's test on log-transformed values, blocking antibody rose significantly in the patients receiving PRW but was unchanged in those receiving placebo.

  ".W": "Caffeine is the most widely consumed drug in Western society. The intake of caffeine-containing beverages in many adults and children often reaches levels that can induce pharmacological effects. Ninety-nine percent of ingested caffeine is absorbed and distributed to all tissues and organs. The effects of caffeine intake differ greatly according to acute or chronic intake, level of intake, and the development of tolerance. Caffeine administered acutely to non-users or recent abstainers can induce hypertension, arrhythmias, altered myocardial function, increased plasma catecholamine levels, plasma renin activity, serum cholesterol levels, increased production of urine, gastric acid secretion, and alterations in mood and sleep patterns. Tolerance to chronic caffeine intake develops in most individuals, with the cessation of its effects on the renal system, the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system and, to some extent, the central nervous system. Moderate caffeine consumers probably need to have little concern for the effect of caffeine intake on their health if their other life-style habits are also moderate.\r"

  ".W": "One system of management for the pregnant woman with Type I diabetes is to instruct her in the strategies of achieving and maintaining normoglycemia with the use of self blood glucose monitoring, split doses of insulin, and titration of insulin to cover the meal plan. Normoglycemia is achieved only when the meal plan is adhered to in a rigid fashion to facilitate the insulin dose surrounding the meal. A 30 kcal/kg diet is divided into three meals and three snacks, of which 40% is composed of carbohydrate. These frequent small feedings must be perfectly timed to meet the insulin injected. Such systems require 35 hours of intensified training to become skilled in the techniques of diabetes self-care, but still the regimen does not provide much flexibility. When a pregnant woman also wishes to honor her religious beliefs by keeping kosher and so following another set of rigid laws surrounding the meal plan, adherence to both sets of rules becomes a challenge. Specifically, attention to separating milk and meat and eating only kosher foods must be part of the program. This article describes not only the basic diabetes self-care method but also how to adapt the method to the laws of keeping kosher while sustaining normoglycemia.\r"

Evaluations at admission, two and four weeks, and three and six months postadmission by independent evaluators allowed comparisons between the care groups with reference to survival, length of stay, disposition, physical, mental, and social functional levels, and use of services after discharge. Data from charts and treatment logs allowed the care processes to be compared. Findings determined that patients in the two groups were alike on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics at entry. Results demonstrated that patients in the trial and control groups fared similarly on the outcome measures at each evaluation point, although a trend toward better survival among team patients was noted. It was concluded that the addition of a consultative geriatric team to the medical wards failed to show a significant impact on patient outcomes.\r"

We performed a randomized controlled trial of a postcard reminder in the three private general internal medicine practices. The observed vaccination rates of 55% in experimental patients (N = 262) and 54% in control patients (N = 278) were similar, though much higher than estimated national rates of 20%. The data indicated that the baseline (control group) vaccination rate was high probably because study participants were exposed to many community vaccination cues, separate from the study cue. That vaccination rates were not higher after additional exposure to the study cue suggests that a \"ceiling effect\" occurred. Including 70 patients not randomized into the trial because they received flu shots prior to randomization, the vaccination rate in patients who had a clinic visit during autumn months was 75% compared to a rate of 52% in patients not visiting the clinic (P less than .001). Our results suggest that vaccination rates can be considerably higher in the private sector than those reported in the past, and that both vaccination cues and direct patient contact appear important to promote vaccination. This and other studies suggest that traditional cues may have a ceiling effect, yielding vaccination rates no higher than 55 to 65%; further increases in rates will require other approaches.\r"

Clinical follow-up and endoscopy were performed before and after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. Endoscopy was also carried out whenever symptoms compatible with ulcer recurrence were present for more than 2 days. Both groups were well matched for age, sex, duration of peptic ulcer disease, and smoking habits. There were 21 drop-outs due to lack of compliance. Therefore, 32 patients treated with pirenzepine and 31 with placebo were included in the analysis. Expressed in cumulative percentage of recurrence, with pirenzepine, 28% of the patients had a relapse at 3 months, 41% at 6 months, and 53% at 12 months; with placebo, the recurrence rates were 58% at 3 months, 68% at 6 months, and 71% at 12 months. The mean success time at 1 year is also longer for pirenzepine (7.38 months) than for placebo (5.52 months). These differences are significantly in favor of pirenzepine (p less than 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Dry mouth was more frequently observed with pirenzepine (14 versus 5 patients). We conclude that pirenzepine, 50 mg twice daily, significantly reduces the relapse rate of duodenal ulcers during a 1-year maintenance treatment.\r"

These causes have in common the ability to increase acid delivery to the duodenum, the ability to decrease duodenal defense against an acid load, or a combination of these abilities. Some causes of duodenal ulcer disease are acquired; others are genetically determined. Ulcer recurrence in smokers is common because nicotine impairs the capacity of the duodenum to buffer an acid load. Duodenal ulcer recurrences are also common in nonsmokers because treatments fail to correct underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of ulcer disease. Optimum therapy should take into account the role of offensive and defensive factors in the development of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "A proteolytically modified form of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) present in the serum of patients suffering from autoimmune, immunodeficient diseases and cancer has been reported in the literature. In the present study we show that human beta 2-m as well as the proteolytically modified human form (M-beta 2-m) bind to murine lymphocytes expressing H-2 class I antigens; M-beta 2-m, when added at day 0 and 1 of culture in nanomolar concentrations to a one-way murine allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) augments the generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes; M-beta 2-m increases the endogenous production of interleukin 2 in the MLC culture; monoclonal antibody which reacts with both the native beta 2-m and M-beta 2-m molecule blocks the augmentation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte production induced by M-beta 2-m; murine as well as human MLC responder cells can proteolytically modify native human beta 2-m; and the modifying activity of murine MLC responder cells was blocked in an intermediary step by an alloantibody, which reacts specifically with murine major histocompatibility complex, class I-associated beta 2-m. These findings suggest that the modification process is preceded by an association of human beta 2-m with the cell surface of the responder cells. Our data indicate that the modification of beta 2-m might reflect early events in allospecific responder cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "87281613\r", 
  ".W": "Human cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones form conjugates with both antigen-positive and antigen-negative lymphoblastoid cells. Conjugates with antigen-negative targets form as rapidly, and are almost as frequent, as those with antigen-positive targets; both types are strong. Monoclonal antibodies against lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, CD2, and LFA-3 (or their Fab fragments) each consistently inhibit conjugate formation, but only partially; mixes of alpha LFA-1 with either CD2 monoclonal antibodies or alpha LFA-3 cause complete inhibition. Our previous studies have demonstrated two distinct pathways of antigen-independent conjugate (AIC) formation, one involving LFA-1 and the other involving CD2/LFA-3. The present studies showing supra-additive inhibition with mixes of Fab indicate that at least a major fraction of the conjugates involve T cells which utilize both pathways. Preincubation studies (and restricted expression for CD2) demonstrate that in the CD2/LFA-3 pathway, CD2 is critical on the effector and LFA-3 on the target and that in the LFA-1 pathway, LFA-1 is critical on the effector. Analysis of conjugate formation by primary allosensitized T cells confirms the critical findings made with T cell clones. Among a panel of antigen-negative \"target\" cell lines tested, there is wide variation in the number of AIC formed with cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones; this variation correlates partially with differences in level of expression of LFA-3. Both pathways of adhesion are utilized in AIC formation with all five targets tested, but there was variation between targets in the relative contribution by each pathway. Studies of inhibition of lysis (rather than conjugate formation) support the relevance of the two-pathway model to the lytic process as a whole. These studies demonstrate the general involvement of two pathways of adhesion in human T cell interactions: one involving T cell LFA-1 and the other involving T cell CD2 binding to target cell LFA-3.\r"

  ".U": "87281625\r", 
  ".W": "Purified, recombinant-derived murine granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor was found to enhance the primary in vitro immune response to SRBC by murine spleen cells. In determining the mechanism of this augmentation, it was found that only splenic adherent cells and neither resting nor activated T cells nor B cells expressed specific receptors for GM-CSF. When splenic adherent cells were pulsed briefly with GM-CSF before addition to macrophage-depleted cultures, they reconstituted the PFC response to a significantly greater degree than did control macrophages. Splenic adherent cells incubated overnight with SRBC plus GM-CSF were also more efficient antigen-presenting cells than splenic adherent cells incubated with antigen alone. The mechanism of this enhanced antigen presentation was found to be due to a GM-CSF-dependent increase in the level of IL 1 secretion and Ia antigen expression. Consistent with these data was the finding that GM-CSF augmented IL 2 production by splenic T cells in response to suboptimal concentrations of Con A. Finally, the day 5 in vivo antibody response (as measured by serum titers) of mice immunized with a low dose of SRBC was enhanced by two daily inoculations of GM-CSF. Thus, the role that GM-CSF plays in augmenting immune responses may not be solely accounted for by its ability to cause the proliferation or differentiation of macrophages, but more than likely includes its ability to enhance the function of antigen-presenting macrophages.\r"

In this paper we describe two of these monoclonal anti-CVF antibodies designated GV1.8 and GV1.10, both of which bind to carbohydrate epitopes. On immunoblotting, antibody GV1.8 binds to both the alpha- and beta-chains of CVF, whereas antibody GV1.10 binds only to the alpha-chain of CVF. After enzymatic deglycosylation of CVF with N-glycanase (peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase), both antibodies lose their ability to bind to the deglycosylated protein. Additionally, the free oligosaccharide chains of CVF are able to inhibit the binding of antibodies GV1.8 and GV1.10 to CVF on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, further demonstrating their carbohydrate specificity. Both monoclonal antibodies to CVF cross-react with human C3. Antibody GV1.8 binds to both chains of human C3 indicating that the shared antigenic epitope present on the two glycosylated chains of CVF is also present on the two chains of human C3. Antibody GV1.10 cross-reacts only with the beta-chain of human C3 which is the homologous chain to the alpha-chain of CVF. After enzymatic deglycosylation of human C3 by N-glycanase, both antibodies lose their ability to bind to the deglycosylated protein consistent with the carbohydrate nature of the recognized epitopes. These results indicate that CVF and human C3 share carbohydrate epitopes on their homologous and nonhomologous chains.\r"

Only one of the synthetic peptides, SM5(164-197)C, inhibited reactivity of the affinity-purified antibodies with pep M5 by ELISA.

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for epitopes of a 57,000 m.w., cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP57) purified from granules of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been produced. Both were IgG1 mouse antibodies with typical heavy and light chain structure. The mAb reactive with CAP57 failed to react specifically with other heretofore defined PMN or serum proteins as shown by ELISA. Both mAb showed specific reactivity in Western blots with CAP57. One of these mAb (P1G8) inhibited the antimicrobial action of CAP57 by 50% at a ratio of 62.5 micrograms antibody per microgram CAP57. The other mAb, P2A5, had no inhibitory capacity for CAP57. Binding constants of the two mAb for the antigen were determined and were found to be virtually identical. Thus, the greater inhibitory capacity of P1G8 for bacterial killing by CAP57 was not directly related to binding strength of the mAb. Competition experiments showed that unlabeled P1G8 could compete as well against radiolabeled P2A5 as could unlabeled P2A5. In the reverse experiment, it was seen that P1G8 competed with radiolabeled P1G8 for CAP57 better than unlabeled P2A5. These findings could be due to two antibodies that recognize different but adjacent epitopes on CAP57, one of the epitopes (P1G8) being closer to structure(s) of the protein essential to its antimicrobial action. Immunocytochemical studies showed positive staining with both mAb. The reaction was restricted to the cytoplasm of peripheral blood PMN and was of a granular pattern. Other peripheral blood cells (which included red blood cells, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) failed to bind either mAb.\r"

Cefotaxime, but not chloramphenicol, induced a marked increase of endotoxin in CSF, from log10 1.5 +/- 0.8 to log10 2.8 +/- 0.7 ng/ml (P less than .01). This result was associated with an increase in brain water content (405 +/- 12 g of water/100 g of dry weight compared with 389 +/- 8 g in untreated controls; P less than .01), whereas in animals treated with chloramphenicol, brain water content was identical to controls. The cefotaxime-induced increase in endotoxin concentration and brain edema were both neutralized by polymyxin B, which binds to the lipid A moiety of endotoxin, or by a monoclonal antibody to lipid A. These results indicate that treating gram-negative bacillary meningitis with selected antibiotics induces increased endotoxin concentrations in CSF that are associated with brain edema.\r"

A 200-micrograms/kg dose was associated with greater systemic reaction than was a 100-micrograms/kg dose. Each treatment group had significant reduction in skin microfilaria counts by day 3 and a decrease of approximately 95% at three months. At three months the proportion of persons with no microfilariae in a specimen of skin was significantly less in the 100-micrograms/kg group than in the 150-micrograms/kg or 200-micrograms/kg groups. At 12 months, the level of microfilariae in skin was still reduced approximately 80%. Significant reduction in ocular involvement was seen in all groups. These results confirm that single-dose ivermectin is effective and well-tolerated and suggest that 150 micrograms of ivermectin/kg may be the optimal dose for initial therapy.\r"

These mutants showed no alteration in expression of capsule, M protein, streptolysins O and S, or pyrogenic exotoxin C. Serial passage of a peptidase-producing strain in vivo resulted in a 100-fold increase in production of C5a peptidase. The presence of C5a peptidase delayed the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) in the peritoneal cavities of mice after intraperitoneal challenge. However, there was no difference in virulence (as evaluated by LD50) between strains that produced and those that lacked C5a peptidase. Although C5a peptidase is expressed on the cell surface, antibody to this enzyme did not opsonize streptococci for phagocytosis in vitro. These studies show that C5a peptidase alters the normal host inflammatory response by delaying the accumulation of PMNLs at the foci of streptococcal infection.\r"

The additional administration of budipine (daily dose 60 mg) was excellently tolerated by 14 patients, while 2 patients left the study because of mental confusion at an early stage of the trial. The budipine group showed a 22% improvement on the Columbia Rating Scale (median score). Compared with the placebo group (4% improvement), there was a highly significant difference (P less than 0.01, one-tailed test). Of the three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the best effect was seen on tremor, and less pronounced effects on bradykinesia and rigidity. Owing to its long half-life (31 h) with little plasma level fluctuations, budipine appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\r"

Low levels of ER immunoreactivity were found in tumours from 51% of patients, whereas ER binding activity was demonstrated in 40% of the meningiomas examined. In 8 (11%) tissue samples multiple binding sites for oestradiol were observed. The immunoreactive binding sites corresponded to the classical, high-affinity ER. In ligand binding studies, however, measurement of classical ER was considerably influenced by a second low-affinity, high-capacity oestrogen binding component even at low ligand concentrations. 3H-methylpromegestone and 3H-methyltrienolone, a synthetic gestagen and androgen, were used for concurrent determination of the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR) binding activity. High concentrations of PR were detected in 53 (76%), whereas moderate levels of AR binding sites were demonstrated in 33 (47%) tumours. A positive correlation between ER immunoreactivity and AR binding activity is indicative for an oestrogen regulation of AR via the ER system. The presence of gonadal steroid receptors in a large proportion of meningiomas and the tendency for a dependence of receptor concentrations on the histological subtype could have implications for tumour therapy.\r"

Experience with both techniques has resulted in a specific procedure for CT-guided free-hand biopsy which is performed in the CT suite under local anesthesia. Over the last 6 years the authors have performed 64 CT-guided free-hand biopsies and 13 stereotaxic biopsies with the Brown-Roberts-Wells system. Nonspecific gliosis, tumor, infection, radiation necrosis, or vascular malformation, were diagnosed in all but one biopsy, for a clinically accurate diagnostic yield of 92%. A comparison of diagnostic yield, morbidity, and mortality has shown no significant difference between the free-hand and the stereotaxic techniques. The time required for the procedures and their cost have been compared and have been found to be significantly less for the free-hand biopsy group. Thus, CT-guided free-hand biopsy may still represent the method of choice for histological diagnosis of many intracranial lesions.\r"

This study was performed by immunohistochemical reaction testing for tubulin and creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme to visualize the neuronal structure and by immunohistochemical reaction testing for astroprotein (an astrocyte-specific protein) to visualize reactive astrocytes. The earliest ischemic lesion became visible in the frontoparietal cortex after 7 minutes of ischemia as a laminar loss of the reaction for tubulin involving the neuropil, neuronal perikarya, and dendrites. The earliest lesion in the caudoputamen evolved after 30 minutes of ischemia. After reestablishment of cerebral circulation, the immunohistochemical ischemic lesions in the neuronal structure disappeared if the ischemic period was 10 minutes or less and partially disappeared even after ischemia for 15 minutes in the cerebral cortex, while the postischemic lesion in the caudoputamen disappeared even after ischemia for 15 minutes. Reactive astrocytes were detected in the cerebral cortex and caudoputamen as early as 24 hours after reperfusion, both in the areas with and without the neuronal lesions. No lesion was identified in the hippocampus or thalamus. This experimental model is suitable for investigation of rapidly progressive regional ischemia in the cerebral cortex and for comparison with other regional or global cerebral ischemia in the gerbil or other animal species.\r"

Scanning electron micrographs (SEM's) of catheters removed from pediatric patients with shunts infected by Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed numerous bacterial cells and microcolonies, leukocytes, and erythrocytes attached to the CSF catheters' inner walls, as well as the existence of surface irregularities, such as fissures, rugosities, and holes. Permeability analyses and SEM's demonstrated that catheters develop physical alterations over the period of implantation. Different bacterial strains presented a different in vitro adherence to CSF shunts, suggesting that this attachment may be affected by specific properties of the outer structures of each strain. The attachment of microbial pathogens to CSF shunts seems to contribute to the persistence of bacterial cells within a catheter and the onset of recurrent shunt infection. This study demonstrated that some bacteria can remain attached within shunts in vitro despite a CSF flow at rates up to 200 times higher than those normally demonstrated in vivo. Furthermore, surface irregularities found throughout this study may help to anchor and hide bacterial microcolonies. Based on these findings, it seems advisable to remove an infected shunt and to replace it with a new one after proper antimicrobial therapy, in order to prevent recurrent infections.\r"

Oropharyngeal-stimulated responses are reliably initiated by the taste and smell of food. These gastrointestinal reflexes, often referred to as anticipatory or cephalic phase responses, are mediated by the autonomic nervous system and are believed to be independent of the postabsorptive effects of ingested nutrients. A common pathway used by cephalic phase responses to trigger gastrointestinal secretions is the vagus. Several studies have also demonstrated that cephalic stimulation activates both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and thus, many cephalic-metabolic reflexes may arise indirectly from more general physiological changes that accompany oropharyngeal stimulation. The present studies suggest that oral stimulation results in alterations in intestinal function. Specifically, oropharyngeal stimulation of conscious, unrestrained rats with sucrose increases the uptake of radioactive glucose from the small intestine into the hepatic portal blood.\r"

As a result of sucrose consumption there were significant increases in serum insulin and decreases in serum phosphorus, but no change in serum total or filterable calcium, zinc, sodium or potassium. Urine calcium peaked at 1.5 h and was significantly increased from 10 through 2.5 h. Sucrose-induced increases in serum insulin and urine calcium were highly variable among subjects, and within the group were significantly correlated (r = 0.82, P less than 0.01). Urine calcium excretion was correlated with serum phosphorus (r = 0.41, P less than 0.05) and urine zinc (r = 0.80, P less than 0.01). Sucrose consumption also increased the urinary excretion of zinc and sodium, although renal reabsorption was not impaired. The effects of sucrose on urinary calcium are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin inhibits renal calcium reabsorption.\r"

In nonlactating rats fed a high fat diet, blood glucose concentration was slightly higher, whereas plasma insulin concentration was lower than in nonlactating rats fed a high carbohydrate diet. In the postabsorptive state, plasma free fatty acids and blood ketone bodies were not modified by the nature of the diet consumed.

Because insulin and glucagon are involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and they act via their receptors, we investigated the role of insulin and glucagon receptors in obese and lean female Zucker rats. Because dietary sucrose is more lipogenic than starch, we also studied the effect of dietary carbohydrates on the receptors. Significant phenotypic effect (obese greater than lean) was observed on plasma levels of glucose, triglyceride and insulin. Binding of insulin and glucagon to liver plasma membranes was significantly lower in obese rats than in lean rats. Lower insulin binding was due to a lower number of receptors as well as a lower affinity, whereas the lower glucagon binding was due only to a lower receptor number. Insulin binding in lean rats but not in obese rats was lower in sucrose-fed than in starch-fed rats. Diet had no effect on glucagon binding. We propose that in obese Zucker rats, in addition to hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucagon activity as manifested by decreased glucagon binding to target tissues may be an important contributor to the hyperlipemia and obesity.\r"

From a referral clinic, 120 obese (greater than 130 per cent of ideal body weight) diabetic patients who were not taking insulin were recruited. Of these, 55 per cent were female and 49 per cent were black; the mean age was 53 years. Mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1%) was 10.2 per cent. Each subject was assigned to one of three groups: monthly group sessions with videotapes for diabetic persons with low literacy skills; monthly group sessions without videotapes; or no monthly sessions. After seven months, there had been 16 dropouts (13 per cent). Differences in weight changes between groups were significant (p less than 0.05); group 1 lost a median of 1 kg of weight (p less than 0.05) compared with a 0.1-kg loss and no change in groups 2 and 3, respectively. This weight loss was not sustained at 11 months. There was no significant change in HbA1%. Age, education, and compliance beliefs did not predict outcome. The authors conclude that the patient education programs did not result in sustained glucose or weight control.\r"

Seventy-six volunteer adult patients with NIDDM were each assigned to one of four programs: diet, exercise, diet plus exercise, or education (control). Each program required ten weekly meetings. Detailed evaluations were completed prior to the program and after three, six, 12, and 18 months. Evaluations included various psychosocial measures, measures of the quality of life, and fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and relative weight determinations. Of the 76 original participants, 70 completed the 18-month follow-up study. At 18 months, the combination diet-and-exercise group had achieved the greatest reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin measures. In addition, this group showed significant improvements on a general quality of life measure. These improvements were largely uncorrelated with changes in weight. The authors conclude that the combination of dietary change and physical conditioning benefits NIDDM patients, and that the benefits may be independent of substantial weight loss.\r"

A decision analytic model was developed which considered four strategies: immediate treatment, no treatment, performing a rapid antigen test, or obtaining a bacterial culture. Patient outcomes were expressed in \"well\" days, which were reduced by the \"sick\" days associated with adverse reactions to treatment or complications of GABHS infection. When immediate test results are available, testing is the optimal strategy for probabilities of GABHS between 1 and 49 per cent. This range includes almost all patients, using probability estimates based on clinical criteria. The absolute benefit of testing was 0.1 days. The major advantage of a rapid test is the avoidance of penicillin reactions. Variations in the symptomatic benefits of treatment had minimal effects on the analysis. The analysis supports the use of an antigen test for adult patients with pharyngitis.\r"

Other donor graft sites that are more similar to the mandibular condyle might be more suitable for mandibular condylar replacement. Previous studies have shown the histomorphologic and developmental similarities between the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) and temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The purpose of this study was to evaluate histologically short-term adaptations within the TMJ after replacement of the mandibular condyle with the autogenous sternal head of the clavicle, and to compare these adaptations with autogenous CCJ and mandibular condyle (surgical control) transplants. Bilateral vertical ramus osteotomies were performed in 12 juvenile Macaca mulatta with the left condyle being immediately replaced and the right condyle removed and replaced with either the sternal head of the clavicle or costochondral junction of a rib. All grafts were stabilized with maxillomandibular fixation for five weeks. Two animals in each group were killed at five, 11, and 17 weeks postsurgery and prepared for histologic analysis. The results indicate that: 1) incorporation of all grafts into the recipient site occurred and all animals had good mandibular function and occlusion throughout the follow-up period; 2) the clavicular and mandibular condylar grafts were incorporated sooner than the CCJ grafts; 3) clavicular graft changes resembled those of the condylar grafts histologically while the costal grafts remained inert and unchanged; and 4) a new condylar process with cartilage similar to that of a normal mandibular condyle regenerated in the costal graft animals from cells presumably contributed by the periosteum of the mandibular ramus and TMJ capsule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Records of inpatients with acute rheumatic fever were reviewed for the 10 years prior to 1986. The clinical manifestations in inpatients from 1976 to 1985 were not significantly different from those of inpatients seen during 1986. Similar outbreaks have been reported elsewhere, and physicians should be aware of a possible resurgence of classic acute rheumatic fever and ensure compliance with an adequate course of therapy for patients with streptococcal pharyngitis.\r"

Forty VLBW neonates (700 to 1300 g birth weight, 26 to 30 weeks gestational age), who were oxygen dependent and required mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours after birth, were given by the intramuscular route either supplemental vitamin A (retinyl palmitate 2000 IU) or 0.9% saline solution on postnatal day 4 and every other day thereafter for a total of 14 injections over 28 days. The study groups were comparable in gestational maturity, clinical characteristics, initial lung disease, and vitamin A status at entry into the trial. Vitamin A administration resulted in significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of vitamin A and retinol-binding protein in treated infants compared with controls. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in nine of 20 infants given vitamin A supplement and in 17 of 20 control infants (P less than 0.008). Four of 19 infants in the vitamin A group and 11 of 20 in the control group required mechanical ventilation on study day 28 (P less than 0.029). The need for supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care was reduced in infants given vitamin A supplement compared with controls. Airway infection and retinopathy of prematurity were less frequent in the vitamin A group. We conclude that vitamin A supplementation at the dosage used in this trial in VLBW neonates not only improves their vitamin A status but also appears to promote regenerative healing from lung injury, as evidenced by a decrease in the morbidity associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\r"

It was found that [D-Arg]-SP (3.3 nmol i.t.) reduced mean arterial pressure and cardiac output due to a reduction in stroke volume. Total peripheral resistance was not altered. Whereas most vascular beds showed no alterations in vascular resistance, a renal vasoconstriction was noted. The hypotensive effect of [D-Arg]-SP was blocked by phentolamine (10 mg/kg i.v.) but not by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). In the absence of changes in vascular arterial resistance due to [D-Arg]-SP, it appears that a change in venous return may contribute to the [D-Arg]-SP-induced reduction in stroke volume. These data provide evidence that a spinal cord SP system may tonically affect sympathetic neurons controlling venous, but not arterial, vasomotor tone. [D-Arg]-SP (i.t.) did not alter brain blood flow but significantly decreased blood flow in the thoracolumbar spinal cord 15 to 20 min after administration. The reduction in spinal cord flow did not appear to be responsible for the [D-Arg]-SP-induced hypotension because kainic acid (i.t.), an agent that interacts with glutamate receptors, produced similar pressor responses in the presence and absence of [D-Arg]-SP. In addition, whereas the pressor effect of low doses of a SP agonist [pGlu5, MePhe8, MeGly9]-substance P (5-11) were blocked by [D-Arg]-SP, a higher dose produced the typical pressor effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In order to characterize the hemodynamic actions of urotensin I, a vasodilator peptide with selectivity for the mesenteric vascular bed, we studied its hypotensive effects and interference with alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic vasoconstrictor responses in the rat. After i.v. administration in anesthetized rats, urotensin I (0.06-6 nmol/kg) produced a dose-dependent lowering of arterial blood pressure. At hypotensive doses, urotensin I was about 3 times more potent in antagonizing systemic pressor responses to the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, than responses to the nonselective adrenoceptor agonist, norepinephrine. Additional studies were performed on the blood-perfused mesenteric bed of the anesthetized rat and on the isolated rat superior mesenteric artery, using as tools phenylephrine, norepinephrine and the relatively selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, alpha-methylnorepinephrine. The selectivity of the three agonists for vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the blood-perfused mesenteric bed was confirmed using prazosin and yohimbine as selective antagonists of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, respectively. Urotensin I diminished the maximum increase in perfusion pressure and shifted the log dose-response curves to the right for all three agonists. A marked selectivity of urotensin I for alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated responses was observed: IC30 values of the peptide for pressor responses to phenylephrine, norepinephrine and alpha-methylnorepinephrine were 0.05, 0.83 and greater than 6 nmol/kg, respectively. A less pronounced selectivity of urotensin I for alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated contractions could be demonstrated in isolated strips of the superior mesenteric artery of the rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of prostacyclin (PGI2) (10 pg/ml-10 ng/ml) on the response of hearts to ischemia and reperfusion were studied. Ischemia caused a 55% decline in contractile force and the development of contracture. Sinus bradycardia and varying degrees of atrioventricular conduction block were observed. Reperfusion was associated with rapid recovery of contractile force and a gradual decline in resting tension. PGI2 (1 ng/ml) enhanced ischemic contracture significantly at 10 and 20 min (P less than .05). Hearts made ischemic in the presence of PGI2 developed higher degrees of atrioventricular conduction block when compared to controls. Reperfusion in the presence of 1 or 10 ng/ml of PGI2 caused a significant decline in recovery of force (P less than .05) and enhanced reperfusion-associated contracture. We examined the influence of verapamil (100 ng/ml) and lowering external calcium to 1.25 mM on hearts subjected to ischemia and reperfusion in the absence of presence of PGI2 (1 ng/ml). Neither verapamil nor 1.25 mM calcium exerted significant effects on the decline of contractile force during ischemia or on recovery of contractility upon reperfusion. However, verapamil did reverse the reperfusion-associated cardiodepressant effects of PGI2. Verapamil abolished contracture in control hearts after 5 and 10 min of reperfusion and prevented the enhancement of contracture in hearts reperfused in the presence of PGI2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The compound raised the content of acetylcholine selectively in striatum and not in other brain areas including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, hemispheric residuum and midbrain-hindbrain, mirroring the action of dopaminomimetic drugs. That the increase in acetylcholine content reflected a depression of striatal cholinergic neuronal activity was substantiated by the drug's ability to inhibit sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake, to reduce the electrically evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine from striatal slices in vitro and to reduce acetylcholine release from striatum in freely moving rats in vivo. The increase in striatal acetylcholine was prevented by the D-1 dopaminergic agonist, SK 38393-A, but not by the D-2 agonist, LY 171555. Inhibition of dopamine synthesis by DL alpha-methyltyrosine methyl ester HCI or the selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine HBr prevented the acetylcholine increasing effect of SCH 23390 completely, suggesting that presynaptic dopamine is important in the action of the dopaminergic antagonist. In agreement with these findings, SCH 23390 amplified the action of amphetamine, a dopamine releaser, on striatal cholinergic neurons. Furthermore, blockade of D-2 receptors by pimozide or sulpiride did not suppress the cholinergic effect of SCH 23390. When combined with a subthreshold dose of LY 171555, SCH 23390 did not potentiate the action of the D-2 dopaminergic agonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGA2 and delta 12-PGJ2 (9-deoxy-delta 9,12-PGD2) are taken up by cultured cells and exert growth inhibition. Within cells they are transferred to and accumulate in nuclei by a temperature-dependent process. In this study, the authors analyzed and compared subnuclear distribution and binding of these PGs. Nuclei accumulating either [3H]PGA2 or [3H] delta 12-PGJ2 were extracted successively with a hypotonic solution and with a 1% Triton X-100 solution, and the radioactivities in the two extracts (fractions of nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane, respectively) and the remaining residues (a fraction of chromatin and nuclear matrix) were determined. About three-fourths of PGA2-derived nuclear radioactivity was found in the extracts, and only 20% in the residues. Most of the radioactivity in the extracts was recovered in ethyl acetate under acidic conditions and identified as intact PGA2, suggesting that the majority of PGA2 in nuclei was present as free molecules. On the other hand, more than 70% of delta 12-PGJ2-derived nuclear radioactivity was associated with the residues and resistant to extraction with acidic ethyl acetate. This radioactivity, however, became extractable after brief alkali treatment and was identified as intact delta 12-PGJ2. In order to identify nuclear component binding of this PG, the authors digested the residues with either DNases or proteases. The radioactivity in the residues was almost completely released by digestion with proteases and clearly separated from DNA by ethanol precipitation. These results suggested that most of nuclear delta 12-PGJ2 bound covalently to protein(s) of chromatin and nuclear matrix.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under standard assay conditions, MRA and ADR demonstrated a similar inhibitory effect on the enzymes, whereas MRA-CN showed a slightly greater inhibitory activity than ADR or MRA at low drug concentrations, but with the inhibitory effect plateauing when drug concentration reached 10 microM. Both the A and B forms of the MRA-CN diastereoisomers were effective as inhibitors. Kinetic studies of the inhibition showed that unlike ADR, MRA-CN inhibition of DNA or RNA synthesis could not be reversed by increasing DNA-template concentration in the reaction mixture. Whereas ADR or MRA relaxed completely 1 microgram of pBR322 supercoiled DNA at a drug concentration of 15 microM, MRA-CN, at 60 microM, produced a mixture of intermediate relaxation forms of the DNA. A complete relaxation was achieved at 300 microM MRA-CN. Both DNA relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopic studies indicated that DNA-drug interactions occurred in the following order: ADR (or MRA) greater than MRA-CN greater than N-trifluoroacetyl-ADR-14-O-hemiadipate (a DNA-nonbinding anthracycline).\r"

  ".W": "In rhesus monkeys, kappa opioid agonists have been shown to increase urinary output, increase tail-withdrawal latencies from warm water and produce distinct discriminative stimulus effects. In order to explore further the relation between these effects and activity at the kappa opioid receptor type, the antagonist activity of quadazocine against several kappa opioid agonists was examined with the tail-withdrawal and drug-discrimination procedures. Quadazocine dose dependently antagonized the increases in tail-withdrawal latency produced by the kappa agonists bremazocine, ethylketazocine and U-50, 488, as well as the discriminative stimulus effects of these drugs. The dose-ratio analysis of Schild revealed apparent pA2 values for quadazocine in combination with bremazocine, ethylketazocine and U-50, 488 of 6.1, 6.4 and 6.4, respectively, with the tail-withdrawal procedure and 6.3, 6.4 and 6.1, respectively, with the drug-discrimination procedure. Quadazocine also antagonized the effects of a mu agonist (morphine) in the tail-withdrawal procedure, and the apparent pA2 value for these data was 8.2. The activity of the mu-selective alkylating agent, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), was examined alone and in combination with the kappa agonist ethylketazocine in the urinary-output, tail-withdrawal and drug-discrimination procedures. At about 30 to 60 min postinjection, beta-FNA alone produced ethylketazocine-appropriate responding under the drug-discrimination procedure and increased urine output but did not increase tail-withdrawal latencies. At 24 to 48 hr postinjection, beta-FNA did not antagonize effects of ethylketazocine in any of the three procedures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The kappa opioid agonists, Mr 2033 and U-50, 488, or the mu opioid agonist, morphine, were administered chronically to three separate groups of rhesus monkeys. Tolerance developed to the overt signs of intoxication produced by each compound. Monkeys receiving morphine were not cross-tolerant to Mr 2033 or to U-50, 488, and monkeys receiving U-50, 488 were not cross-tolerant to morphine. Monkeys given Mr 2033 chronically were, however, cross-tolerant to morphine. When administration of U-50,488 was interrupted, or the monkeys receiving this compound were given an opioid antagonist, withdrawal behaviors were displayed that were qualitatively different from deprivation or antagonist-induced morphine withdrawal. These signs were suppressed by kappa agonists but not by morphine. Deprivation-induced withdrawal from Mr 2033 resulted in signs similar to those shown by U-50,488-dependent monkeys and some signs were observed in withdrawn morphine-dependent monkeys. Several antagonists, including the mu-selective antagonist beta-funaltrexamine, precipitated signs of withdrawal normally associated with morphine dependence in Mr 2033-dependent monkeys. Withdrawal from Mr 2033 was suppressed by kappa agonists in a stereoselective manner, and by morphine. The asymmetrical cross-tolerance and cross-dependence between Mr 2033 and morphine, and the appearance of morphine-like signs during precipitated withdrawal, suggest that Mr 2033 is kappa receptor selective but not specific. Dependence to U-50,488, however, was qualitatively and pharmacologically distinct from morphine-dependence and is apparently a consequence of specific activity at kappa receptors.\r"

In preparations devoid of cartilage, smooth muscle reactivity to both histamine and KCl was reduced. Reactivity to methacholine was unaffected by cartilage removal. In the absence of cartilage, verapamil had a greater depressant effect on the maximum responses to histamine and methacholine than in intact tissues. Similarly, verapamil was more potent against histamine- and methacholine-induced responses in the absence of cartilage where a greater shift to the right was seen in the concentration-response curves when compared with cartilage-containing controls. The spasmolytic action of verapamil on methacholine-induced responses was greater in the absence of cartilage and was greater than its antispasmogenic activity against methacholine (whether or not cartilage was present). Thus, cartilage removal reduces muscle reactivity and increases the potency of verapamil in guinea pig trachealis.\r"

Against single equivalent agonist doses, atropine (135 micrograms/kg i.v.) blocked both acetylcholine- and neurokinin B-, but not substance P- or neurokinin A-induced salivation. [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]-substance P (1 mg/kg i.v.), a putative substance P antagonist, reduced responses to mammalian neurokinins but caused a 2-fold potentiation of acetylcholine-induced salivation. [D-Pro2,D-Trp6,8,Nle10]-Neurokinin B (1 mg/kg i.v.), a novel putative neurokinin B antagonist, significantly reduced substance P- and neurokinin B- but not acetylcholine- or neurokinin A-induced salivation. The three agonists (at doses that produced salivation) and [D-Pro2,D-Trp6,8,Nle10]-neurokinin B (1 mg/kg i.v.) lowered blood pressure in anesthetized rats by 35 to 40%. [D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9]-Substance P (1 mg/kg i.v.) had no significant effect on blood pressure. Hydralazine at 0.60 mg/kg (i.v.), a dose which lowered blood pressure by 47%, did not reduce substance P-induced salivation. Thus, blockade of neurokinin-induced salivation by [D-Pro2,D-Trp6,8,Nle10]-neurokinin B was probably not due to hypotension. Based on the differential effects of the three antagonists on neurokinin- and acetylcholine-induced salivation, we hypothesize the existence of three distinct neurokinin receptors in rat salivary gland, and suggest that neurokinin B receptors reside presynaptically.\r"

  ".W": "Neocortical neurons in cell cultures prepared from fetal mice were impaled for intracellular recording. Dextrorphan (DX), a clinically tested dextrorotatory morphinan lacking opioid action, did not alter neuronal membrane potential or conductance, but produced a selective attenuation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses; kainate and quisqualate responses were not affected. DX also antagonized morphological and chemical (lactate dehydrogenase efflux) evidence of cortical neuronal cell injury produced by toxic bath exposure to NMDA, quinolinate or glutamate, but did not affect toxic exposure to quisqualate or kainate. This selective antagonism of neurotoxicity was apparent at micromolar concentrations of DX with an ED50 of 13 to 17 microM. A similar, but less potent neuron-protective effect, was seen with the opioid levorotatory enantiomer of DX, levorphanol (ED50, 40 microM). The O-methyl derivative of DX, dextromethorphan, also antagonized NMDA and glutamate neurotoxicity, but with possibly lower efficacy than DX. The higher potency of DX over levorphanol suggests that this novel neuron-protective action is not mediated by classic opiate receptors; it may be mediated at the \"sigma opiate\"/phencyclidine site. If further studies establish that DX and related compounds retain neuron-protective efficacy in appropriate animal models, the established clinical safety record of DX and dextromethorphan may allow prompt investigation of the NMDA receptor-blockade strategy in certain neurological disease states.\r"

  ".U": "87283388\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that sera from patients with severe liver damage after halothane anesthesia (\"halothane hepatitis\") contain antibodies reacting with novel antigenic determinants expressed on hepatocytes from rabbits exposed previously to halothane. To determine the structure of the halothane-induced antigen(s), immunoblotting experiments were performed using patient sera and rabbit liver subcellular fractions. Three polypeptide antigens (Mr 100,000, 76,000 and 57,000) expressed in liver fractions from animals sacrificed 16 hr after exposure to 1% halothane in oxygen for 45 min, but not in fractions from unexposed animals, were identified. Analysis of fractions prepared by differential and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and characterized by enzyme marker analysis, localized all three antigens to a microsomal subfraction relatively enriched in glucose-6-phosphatase activity, therefore, presumably derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Antibodies to these antigens were detected in 19 of 24 sera from patients with halothane hepatitis, and four distinct patterns of antibody specificity were observed: 100,000 + 76,000 (seven patients), 100,000 alone (seven patients), 76,000 alone (three patients) and 57,000 alone (two patients). Such antibodies were not detectable in sera from 24 normal blood donors or 36 control patients. Thus, halothane induces expression of three distinct polypeptide antigens in liver, and patients with halothane hepatitis differ in patterns of recognition of these antigens by circulating antibodies.\r"

Preliminary evidence suggests that exercise training in ovulatory, sedentary women and intensified training in women athletes decrease mild premenstrual symptoms. Although conditioning exercise is associated with short luteal phase and anovulatory cycles, decreases in mild premenstrual symptoms occur prior to menstrual cycle changes. Controlled studies of PMS and exercise training may not only document an effective, nonpharmacologic therapy for PMS but also clarify the hormonal etiology of this complex biobehavioral phenomenon.\r"

Detailed studies, however, have failed to reveal good evidence for this assumption, and investigations of weight change and of sodium and water balance have yielded contradictory results. Even so, a number of the etiologic theories and treatment regimens are based on this premise. Many of the endocrine theories depend on the endocrine effect on water balance to explain the mechanism, and the treatment often proposed involves salt and water restriction and the liberal use of diuretics. There is no justification for this advice except for a few well-conducted studies that showed the benefits of diuretic therapy. The evidence from these studies suggests that diuretics, especially spironolactone, have a particular role in the management of the PMS symptoms of bloatedness and abdominal distension despite the fact that the underlying water retention theory remains in doubt. An improvement in the various psychologic symptoms of PMS has also been reported.\r"

Recent studies of progesterone supplementation showed no improvement when it was compared to placebo; the one exception was the use of oral micronized progesterone one therapy at a level of 300 mg/day, but the study remains to be repeated by other investigators. The most logical therapy at present is suppression of ovulation with a short-term trial of danazol, perhaps followed by long-term suppression with estrogen implants or depomedroxyprogesterone acetate. Surgical ovariectomy is warranted in a very small number of cases. Prostaglandin inhibitors are effective for the physical complaints that may be associated with PMS. Some antihypertensive agents, such as clonidine and verapamil, which are also antimania drugs, may have a place in the treatment of PMS.\r"

At the time of operation, nonreconstructable injuries to the porta hepatis were found in addition to destruction of the right lobe. Life-threatening hemorrhage was controlled, but both patients were left with nonfunctional or inadequate hepatic remnants. Liver transplantation was performed. Both patients recovered after liver replacement. One died 7 weeks later of cytomegalovirus infection. The other recipient is well 16 months later. Liver transplantation is a reasonable option in patients with lethal hepatic injuries or unreconstructable injuries to the porta hepatis.\r"

  ".U": "87284011\r", 
  ".W": "Eighty-five patients with penetrating colon injuries, treated either by exteriorized repair (39) or loop colostomy (46), were analyzed. Missile wounds accounted for 75.3% of the injuries. The Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI) was the scoring method employed to assess quantitatively the severity of injuries in each patient. Of 21 patients with right colon injuries, eight were treated by exteriorized repair and the remainder by loop colostomy. PATI and other variables were comparable in both groups. Suture line leaks occurred in two patients (25%) with exteriorized repair. The morbidity was similar in both groups. In left colon trauma, exteriorized repair was employed in 31 patients and 33 underwent loop colostomy. The injury severity indices, clinical status, and time lapse to laparotomy were similar in both groups. Colostomy was avoided in 67.7% (21 of 31) patients with exteriorized repair. The incidence of abscesses was significantly higher in the colostomy group compared to the group treated by exteriorized repair (24.2% and 6.4%, respectively; p less than 0.05). The length of hospital stay was shorter after exteriorized repair (17.2 days vs. 23.2 days; p less than 0.05). All three mortalities (3.5%) were related to associated injuries. We conclude that exteriorized repair is a safe and superior alternative to loop colostomy in penetrating colon trauma.\r"

Treatment studies have examined abstinence oriented and controlled drinking therapies, voluntary disulfiram treatment, and combined behavioral-pharmacological treatment. The first three treatments were shown to be ineffective in impacting alcohol consumption. The ineffectiveness reported by these studies was attributed to patients' lack of motivation. However, the combined behavioral-pharmacological treatment, which made methadone treatment contingent on antabuse consumption, resulted in decreases in both alcohol consumption and arrests, with increases occurring in employment. Future research should examine the generality of the findings from combined treatment as well as examine whether other contingency management procedures may reduce alcohol consumption in the alcoholic methadone patient.\r"

Each GSV was also visually assessed at operation. Eighty-five GSVs were successfully used for infrainguinal revascularization; duplex scanning correctly identified 82 of these GSVs as being acceptable for use in in situ bypass. Seventeen GSVs were unacceptable for in situ bypass; duplex scanning correctly identified 11 of these as being unacceptable. Duplex scanning provides anatomic information about the GSV, including size, patency, course, varicosities, double segments, and tributaries. This information permits the surgeon to perform infrainguinal revascularization expeditiously.\r"

Long incisions necessary to expose the entire vein with the use of other techniques can be avoided, thereby decreasing the potential for wound healing problems commonly associated with vascular reconstruction in ischemic limbs.\r"

  ".U": "87284195\r", 
  ".W": "Complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may result in a variety of clinical states. Neurologic symptoms in the setting of ICA occlusion may be due to embolic events through the external carotid artery (ECA) circulation, hemodynamic insufficiency resulting from inadequate collateral development, or propagation of clot intracranially. External carotid reconstruction has been used to prevent neurologic events from the first two mechanisms. This review attempts to place in perspective the current indications for, techniques of, and results from ECA revascularization. A discussion of the cerebral collateral circulation is included for reference. Twenty-three series were collected from the literature. Cases were excluded in which procedures other than ECA reconstruction were undertaken, leaving 218 cases for analysis. These represented 195 EC endarterectomies and 23 ECA bypasses. Resolution of symptoms was seen in 83% of patients with another 7% showing marked improvement. The perioperative mortality rate was 3%; neurologic deaths accounted for most perioperative deaths. The overall neurologic complication rate was 5%. More recent reports were notable for improved mortality and morbidity. A diseased contralateral carotid artery was associated with higher neurologic morbidity whereas disease in the vertebral arteries had no impact on outcome. The best results were obtained when surgery was performed to relieve specific hemispheric or retinal symptoms as opposed to nonspecific neurologic complaints or previous stroke. The symptomatic patient with ICA occlusion has a poor neurologic prognosis. In selected circumstances ECA reconstruction should be considered among the treatment options in this clinical setting.\r"

Diagnosis, triage, patient disposition, attendant exposure, and preventive actions are detailed. The United States would be well advised to organize its resources definitively to cope with future nonmilitary nuclear accidents.\r"

  ".W": "In-office laboratory testing offers physicians an opportunity to increase their incomes through the potential profit available from technical services. This financial incentive for in-office testing has been altered by Medicare limits on physician payment, legislative changes in physicians' ability to bill Medicare for laboratory tests, and technological advances in office laboratory equipment. While restrictions on payment may make laboratory testing relatively less profitable than other technical services offered in the physician's office, in-office laboratory testing still offers potential financial benefit to physicians, particularly if they can influence the demand for tests. Economic theory suggests that physicians may be able to increase the demand for their services, including laboratory testing, but empirical data are not conclusive. As Medicare and other third-party payers consider fundamental reform in physician payment, the effect of different payment schemes on physicians' use of laboratory tests may have important consequences for physicians' income, the quality of care, patients' access to care, and the cost of the Medicare program.\r"
