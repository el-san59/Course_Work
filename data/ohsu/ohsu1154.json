Eight men with chronic stable angina, a positive treadmill test, and demonstrated responsiveness to long-term oral isosorbide dinitrate were studied after they had been taking effective doses of isosorbide dinitrate three times a day for at least two weeks. Treadmill exercise bouts were performed every 1 to 2 hours over 1 day, after the 8 am application of active nitroglycerin patches in a previously titrated dose, and on another day after application of placebo patches. Mean necessary effective patch dose was 125 sq cm (60 to 220 sq cm). Mean exercise duration to angina rose from 271 to 480 s (p less than 0.001) 1 hour after active patches, while resting systolic blood pressure fell from 122 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). (After placebo patches: +19 s and -2 mm Hg, respectively.) Active patches were superior to placebo throughout the day, but in declining degree (by 94 s at 7 pm, p less than 0.05). Thus, nitroglycerin patches can provide a significant day-long antianginal effect in the patient with long-term exposure to nitrate. However, the need for large doses and individual titration may make this therapy impractical.\r"

To further study these phenomena, we exercised seven normal male volunteers to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer with a 25-W/min ramped protocol measuring arterial blood gas values, and breath-by-breath gas exchange from rest to exercise and through 15 minutes of recovery. Arterial PO2 (PaO2) increased from 108 mm Hg at peak exercise to 125 mm Hg at 2 minutes of recovery. There was a smaller rise in calculated alveolar PO2 (PAO2) from 121 to 128 mm Hg over the same period. Arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) fell from 35.0 mm Hg to 31.9 mm Hg. The gas exchange ratio R rose from 1.21 to 1.52, after having peaked at 1.68 at 1 minute. The alveolar-arterial O2 gradient (P[A-a]O2) fell from 12.3 mm Hg at peak exercise to 3.2 mm Hg at 2 minutes. Following exercise, the rise in R is related to a more rapid fall in O2 uptake than in CO2 output, and the fall in P(A-a)O2 is probably related to improved V/Q relationships and to a rise in mixed venous PO2. We conclude that the rise in PaO2 in the recovery period after progressive nonsteady state exercise is due to several factors, including a fall in P(A-a)O2 and a rise in PAO2 due primarily to an elevation of R and also to a fall in PaCO2.\r"

In a first series of experiments, rh inhibin A (25 micrograms/kg) was injected iv between 0800 and 0830 h, or at 0800 and 1200 h, on proestrus, and plasma hormone levels were measured from 1200-1900 h. Both regimens of administration significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) lowered mean plasma FSH levels but did not mask the primary FSH surge. This treatment also lowered the overall amount of LH released, although the difference between control and inhibin-treated rats only reached statistical significance (P less than or equal to 0.05) after two injections of the protein. Measurement of the number of tubal ova shed on the next estrus showed no difference between rats injected with the vehicle or inhibin at 0830 h. Finally, it was shown that administration of the GnRH antagonist (100 micrograms/kg) at 1200 h interfered with the primary surges of both LH and FSH. In a second series of experiments, rh inhibin A (25 micrograms/kg) was injected once at 2000 h on proestrus. In these animals, inhibin significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) decreased mean plasma FSH levels between 2000 h on proestrus and 0500 h on estrus and totally suppressed the secondary FSH surge. LH secretion remained low in control animals, and no measurable changes were observed after inhibin treatment. Flushing of the ova 5 days later (i.e. during estrus of the subsequent cycle) showed no difference between control and inhibin-treated rats. Injection of the GnRH antagonist (100 micrograms/kg) at 2000 h on proestrus decreased the total amount of FSH secreted during late proestrus and early estrus. However, FSH secretion showed an increase at between 0100 and 0400 h of estrus despite blockade of GnRH receptors. These results indicate that administration of rh inhibin A interferes with both the primary and secondary FSH surges. In contrast to its inability to alter LH release by ovariectomized rats, inhibin also blunted LH secretion during the afternoon of proestrus. Whether these results represent differential effects of inhibin on LH secreted by intact and gonadectomized animals, or whether the documented changes in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH during proestrus are accompanied by an increased sensitivity to inhibin, needs further investigation.\r"

Recently, immunogold electron microscopy was used to demonstrate that all acidophils (a generic term used here to denote cells which secrete GH and/or PRL) in cattle stain for both GH and PRL. This high degree of overlap, which is unique among the mammalian species examined in this regard, raises the question: do all acidophils actively release both hormones concurrently? In the present study, we addressed this question by employing reverse hemolytic plaque assays to measure GH and PRL release from individual bovine pituitary cells in culture in the presence of stimulatory secretagogues. Inconsistent with the previous reports on hormone storage, all bovine acidophils in gonad-intact and castrated males did not actively release both GH and PRL. In gonad-intact males approximately 9% of all pituitary cells released both hormones, whereas 21% released only GH and 45% PRL alone. In castrated males, mammosomatotropes comprised only 22% of the pituitary cell population, whereas GH-only cells accounted for 8% and PRL secretors 46%. This divergence in the relative proportions of GH-only cells and mammosomatotropes suggests that the hormonal milieu plays an important role in maintenance of the various acidophilic cell types. In addition, the reciprocal relationship between cells that released GH-only and dual hormone secretors in the two models studied supports the possibility that these cell types are functionally interconvertible.\r"

  ".W": "Female rhesus monkeys treated with exogenous estrone initially were anovulatory. Although estrone and estradiol concentrations were maintained 1.5- to 2.5-fold elevated, i.e. in the midfollicular range, ovulatory cycles resumed in three of four animals after 6-15 months of anovulation. During the ovulatory cycles the serum bio LH concentrations were the same in estrone-treated animals as during ovulatory cycles of control monkeys, but the daily basal serum FSH concentrations detectable by RIA were significantly reduced during the ovulatory cycles of the estrone-treated animals compared to the cycles of the controls. In the present study serum inhibin concentrations were measured to determine whether or not they were increased and the cause of the selective decrease in FSH concentrations in the estrogen-treated monkeys. Serum LH, FSH, progesterone, and inhibin concentrations were measured by RIA in blood samples collected during the third year of continuous estrogen treatment. The lack of an effect of elevated estrogen on LH concentrations and a significant estrogen-induced decrease in serum FSH concentrations during ovulatory cycles was confirmed (FSH, control: 5.6 +/- 0.68 ng/ml; estrogen-treated: 2.5 +/- 0.09 ng/ml; P = 0.01). There was also a significant decrease in the serum inhibin concentrations detectable by RIA during the follicular phase of the estrone-treated monkeys compared to the follicular phase of the control animals (119 +/- 17 vs. 462 +/- 105 microliter eq/ml; P = 0.04). These results indicate that the lower serum concentrations of FSH in the estrogen-treated monkeys were not a result of an increase in ovarian secretion of inhibin. The lower inhibin concentrations suggest that FSH bioactivity, as well as immunoreactive FSH, is significantly reduced during the ovulatory cycles of the estrone-treated monkeys. Even though the estrogen treatment decreased the FSH bioactivity, sufficient FSH secretion occurs in the presence of the elevated estrone and estradiol concentrations to induce and support apparently normal ovulatory cycles.\r"

We examined the effects of EGF on basal and angiotensin II (AII)-induced aldosterone synthesis in freshly isolated rat and cultured human adrenal glomerulosa cells. EGF alone caused a significant increase in basal aldosterone synthesis in both the rat and human cells. In addition, EGF caused a significant increase in AII-induced aldosterone secretion in both rat and cultured human cells during short and long term incubations. Further, we observed that the effect of EGF was highly specific to AII since it did not alter either potassium (8.7 mM) or ACTH (10(-10) M) mediated increases in aldosterone synthesis. We also investigated possible mechanisms of action of EGF. Since earlier studies showed that the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid plays a key role in mediating AII-induced aldosterone synthesis, we studied the effect of lipoxygenase inhibition in EGF action. We observed that the nonselective lipoxygenase blocker BW755c, which blocked AII-induced aldosterone synthesis, also inhibited EGF mediated increase in aldosterone synthesis. We also examined the effects of EGF on diacylglycerol (DG) formation since DG is an important second messenger in AII action. We found that EGF stimulated basal DG levels and also potentiated AII-induced DG formation, suggesting that EGF may potentiate AII-induced aldosterone synthesis via increases in DG. These results suggest that EGF may play an important role in aldosterone synthesis by acting as a specific positive modulator of AII action in the adrenal.\r"

Western blot analysis was performed using site-specific antipeptide antibodies directed against the pro- and mature regions of the TGF beta 2 precursor. When conditioned medium was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, proteins with mol wt of 53 kDa (containing both mature and proregion sequences), 34-38 kDa (containing proregion sequences only), and 12 kDa (containing mature sequences) were detected. Under nonreducing conditions, complexes of 60- to 80-kDa, 160- to 200-kDa, as well as 24-kDa mature dimers were seen. Cleavage of mature TGF beta 2 from its precursor was inhibited by monensin and chloroquin, but not by ammonium chloride or methylamine. Two peaks of bioactivity were detected after fractionation on a TSK column corresponding to mol wt of 130 and 400 kDa. These peaks contained TGF beta 2 and pro-TGF beta 2 proteins. Partial purification of the 130-kDa complex followed by N-glyconase digestion indicated that the pro-TGF beta 2 proteins were glycosylated. These data demonstrate that BSC-40 cells secrete mature TGF beta 2 complexed with proregion-containing proteins and suggest that this association may contribute to the latency phenomena observed with respect to this growth regulator.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) increases LH secretion in part by enhancing the release of LH in response to GnRH. The present studies examined whether NPY influences the binding of GnRH to its receptors and also assessed whether specific binding sites for NPY exist in rat anterior pituitary membranes. In concentrations from 66-200 nM, NPY dose-dependently enhanced the binding of a 125I-labeled GnRH agonist, [D-Ala6, des-Gly10]GnRH ethylamide (GnRHa; 30 pM) to anterior pituitary membranes of chronically ovariectomized rats; higher concentrations of NPY were ineffective. At 200 nM, NPY significantly increased the high affinity binding of the GnRHa to these membranes, without change in the apparent maximum binding capacity. Further, 200 nM NPY significantly increased the binding of [125I]GnRHa when this tracer was used in concentrations of less than 100 pM, but NPY did not increase the binding of higher concentrations of [125I]GnRHa. Peptide YY, a gastrointestinal peptide structurally and functionally related to NPY, and the hypothalamic/pituitary peptide galanin (both at 200 nM) also increased the binding of [125I]GnRHa (30 pM) to anterior pituitary membranes, but to approximately one third of the extent produced by NPY. Salmon calcitonin, which, similar to NPY, is a strongly hydrophobic neuroendocrine peptide, did not alter GnRHa binding. Mg++ ion dose-dependently reduced the affinity of GnRHa binding, without changing the maximum binding capacity, and also attenuated the increase in GnRHa binding produced by NPY. To further characterize the nature of NPY interaction with anterior pituitary membranes, [125I] peptide YY was used to label NPY binding sites in anterior pituitary and hypothalamic membranes from ovariectomized rats. Specific, and predominantly high affinity, NPY binding sites were demonstrated in hypothalamic membranes, whereas NPY binding to anterior pituitary membranes could be resolved into high and low affinity components. These results show that at low nanomolar concentrations, NPY can enhance the association of GnRHa to receptors in anterior pituitary membranes. This demonstration of increased GnRHa binding in the presence of NPY may explain in part the action of this neuropeptide to potentiate GnRH-induced LH release from anterior pituitary cells.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to investigate whether the increase in circulating atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels produced by angiotensin II (Ang II) is a consequence of the hemodynamic changes or whether it occurs also in the absence of pressor changes. For this purpose in anesthetized and awake rabbits we evaluated the effects of Ang II (0.1 micrograms/kg.min) alone or during the simultaneous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (NP) at a dose titrated to abolish the pressor effects. Systemic blood pressure increased from 76 +/- 4 to 113 +/- 5 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) during Ang II and from 76 +/- 2 to 75 +/- 3 mm Hg (P = NS) during Ang II plus NP. The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, used as a control, raised blood pressure from 65 +/- 2 to 101 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), and its pressor effect was abolished by the concomitant infusion of NP (64 +/- 2 to 61 +/- 1 mm Hg; P = NS). The increase in plasma ANF levels produced by Ang II alone (from 36.5 +/- 5 to 237 +/- 57 pg/ml; P less than 0.001) was not different from that observed during Ang II plus NP (from 46 +/- 10 to 207 +/- 88 pg/ml; P less than 0.001). In contrast, the stimulatory effect on ANF release of phenylephrine (from 56.1 +/- 9 to 202 +/- 40 pg/ml; P less than 0.001) was completely abolished when its pressor effects were prevented by the combined infusion of NP (from 58.5 +/- 15 to 42.3 +/- 10 pg/ml; P = NS). These results show that the stimulatory effect of Ang II on ANF release can be clearly dissociated from its pressor effect, whereas the increase in plasma ANF levels caused by phenylephrine is strictly related to its hemodynamic effect. Therefore, Ang II is capable of modulating ANF secretion in a manner that is independent of its pressor actions. In addition, our results suggest that ANF release is not solely linked to myocyte stretch.\r"

Earlier studies have demonstrated the modulatory role of gonadotropins, growth factors, and GnRH on ovarian LH receptor content. We have now analyzed the influences of gonadotropins (FSH, LH, and PRL), several growth factors, and GnRH on LH receptor mRNA levels in cultured granulosa cells. Cells were obtained from immature estrogen-treated rats and cultured in medium containing FSH with or without growth factors or GnRH for 48 h. Some cells were also treated with FSH for 48 h, followed by treatment with FSH, LH, or PRL for another 2 days. Cellular total RNA was extracted, and blot hybridization with 32P-labeled LH receptor cRNA or 28S ribosomal RNA cDNA probes was performed. Treatment of granulosa cells with FSH increased the levels of five species of LH receptor mRNAs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In FSH-primed cells, LH receptor mRNA levels were maintained by FSH, LH, and PRL. In contrast, treatment of cells with basic fibroblast growth factor or epidermal growth factor suppressed FSH induction of LH receptor mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, whereas treatment with insulin-like growth factor-I had no effect. In addition, GnRH suppressed FSH-stimulated LH receptor mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner; the effects of GnRH could be counteracted by coincubation with a GnRH antagonist, suggesting mediation by specific GnRH-binding sites. These studies demonstrated that the observed stimulatory effects of gonadotropins (FSH, LH, and PRL) and the inhibitory effects of growth factors (epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor) and GnRH on LH receptor content are correlated to their regulation of LH receptor mRNA levels. The granulosa cell culture system should provide a useful model for studying LH receptor gene regulation.\r"

  ".W": "There is extensive evidence that the posterior pituitary (PP) participates in the regulation of PRL secretion. We recently reported that a putative PRL-releasing factor is localized, and possibly produced, in the intermediate lobe of the PP. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether cultured PP cells affect anterior pituitary (AP) function in terms of cell content and cumulative release of PRL. Anterior and posterior pituitaries from adult male rats were dispersed with trypsin and cultured either alone or together for 4 and 8 days in serum-free medium. The concentrations of PRL, GH, and LH in cell extracts and culture media were measured by RIA. Coculturing of AP and PP cells at different plating densities resulted in a 2-fold rise in PRL cell content after 4 days. The cumulative release of PRL in the cocultures was significantly increased only after 8 days. LH and GH were affected slightly, or not at all. Medium conditioned by PP cells mimicked the effects of coculture on the cumulative release of PRL, but not on the cell content. Short-term incubation with TRH induced a much larger release of PRL from AP + PP cocultures than from AP cells cultured alone. In conclusion, these data suggest that 1) PP cells stimulate the production and release of PRL in a hormone-specific manner, and 2) coculturing of AP + PP cells augments the responsiveness of lactotrophs to secretagogues such as TRH. We propose that at least two factors, one of which might be PRL-releasing factor, are involved in these effects.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine PTH-(1-34) (PTH), human recombinant interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1), and cortisol were tested for their effects on bone resorption, prostaglandin (PG) production, and PG endoperoxide synthase (PGH synthase or cyclooxygenase) mRNA levels in cultured mouse parietal bones. Cultures were treated with PTH and IL-1 in the presence and absence of cortisol and arachidonic acid (AA). We found that both PTH and IL-1 stimulated the release of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2). Stimulation of each metabolite by IL-1 at 0.6-60 pM was 2- to 118-fold, and that by PTH at 24 pM to 24 nM was 3- to 53-fold. Thus, IL-1 was 40-fold more potent than PTH in stimulating PG release. Moreover, IL-1 showed 2- to 3-fold greater efficacy than PTH in stimulating PGE2 release. However, IL-1 was only 4-fold more potent and no more effective than PTH in stimulating 45Ca release. IL-1 (60 pM) and PTH (2.4 nM) stimulation of PGE2 production showed a similar time course, with a lag phase of 0.75-1.5 h. Cortisol (1-100 nM) reduced basal PGE2 production and calcium release. The absolute amounts of PG produced in response to PTH and IL-1 were reduced in the presence of cortisol, but in the presence of AA the relative increases were still from 2.5- to 26-fold compared with levels in cultures treated with cortisol alone. Cortisol reduced the stimulation of 45Ca release by IL-1, but not by PTH. AA (10(-5) M) amplified PG production in response to PTH and IL-1, but not 45Ca release. In bones labeled with [3H]AA, IL-1 and PTH increased [3H]PGE2 and [3H]6-keto-PGF1 alpha release, as measured by HPLC and TLC. IL-1 slightly increased [3H]AA release, but PTH did not. Cortisol decreased [3H]AA release. To test for an effect on PG production at the level of PGH synthase, mRNA levels were measured. mRNA was increased by both PTH and IL-1 to a similar extent despite the greater effect of IL-1 on PGE2 production. Cortisol did not change PGH synthase mRNA levels and did not block the stimulation by PTH or IL-1. We conclude that IL-1 is a more potent stimulator of PG production and bone resorption than PTH. Stimulation of PG production by both PTH and IL-1 is mediated at least in part by increasing PGH synthase, but IL-1 may have an additional effect on AA release.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a single injection of ACTH-(1-39) on gonadotropin secretion in the estrogen-primed intact and ovariectomized female rat and to determine if the effect of ACTH was mediated through the release of adrenal steroids. Administration of 100 micrograms ACTH-(1-39/rat caused a significant elevation in serum LH and FSH levels 6 h after injection. This stimulatory action of ACTH was abolished by adrenalectomy in both intact and ovariectomized rats, suggesting that the effect was mediated through the adrenal. A requirement for estrogen priming was demonstrated by a lack of ACTH effect in nonestrogen-primed intact rats. The specificity of ACTH-(1-39) was demonstrated by the absence of effect on FSH and LH secretion by alpha MSH and ACTH-(4-10). Fifteen and 30 min after ACTH stimulation, the adrenal secreted significantly elevated amounts of both progesterone and corticosterone. RU486, which has both antiglucocorticoid and antiprogestin activity, effectively blocked the action of ACTH on gonadotropin secretion. Of the two steroids secreted by the adrenal after ACTH administration, progesterone, but not corticosterone, was able to induce a gonadotropin surge. Since estrogen priming is important for progesterone receptor development, the stimulatory action of ACTH appears to be mediated through progesterone acting through the progesterone receptor. These studies demonstrate that ACTH treatment in the estrogen-primed rat can stimulate LH and FSH secretion through adrenal progesterone secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In the present studies the chronic effects of glucocorticoids and drugs activating cAMP-dependent pathways on the production and secretion of immunoreactive (ir) ANP from long term monolayer cultures of neonatal rat hypothalamic neurons were examined. Forskolin treatment increased ir-ANP release in a time-dependent and dose-related manner, with an EC50 of approximately 30 microM; at a lower dose of 10 microM, forskolin doubled ir-ANP release (P less than 0.01) compared to that in control cultures (mean +/- SEM, 9.6 +/- 0.3 pg/well; n = 4). While dexamethasone (DM) alone did not affect basal secretion of ir-ANP, 10 nM of the glucocorticoid significantly enhanced the effect of forskolin (10 microM) by raising ir-ANP release approximately 3 times that induced by forskolin alone (P less than 0.001). This potentiation of DM was both time dependent and dose responsive, with an EC50 of 1 nM; this effect was significantly suppressed by 100 nM RU38486, a glucocorticoid or type II receptor antagonist, but not by RU28318, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In addition, forskolin (10 microM) or DM (10 nM) alone significantly increased ir-ANP production approximately 1.4 times (P less than 0.05) and 1.3 times (P less than 0.05) over that of control cultures, respectively, whereas concurrent treatment with forskolin and DM increased ir-ANP production by approximately 1.8 times (P less than 0.01). These changes were reflected by a corresponding increment in the abundance of pro-ANP mRNA in the cultures, as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis. We conclude from the present findings that glucocorticoid- and cAMP-dependent pathways may modulate the function of ANP neurons in rat hypothalami by regulating the secretion and production of the neuropeptide at the genomic level.\r"

  ".U": "91209309\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously shown that dopamine-evoked inhibition of corticosteroid production from adrenocortical cells is mediated through a decrease in prostaglandin biosynthesis. Since the catecholamine did not alter the stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid, it was proposed that dopamine may inhibit the formation of arachidonate from glycerophospholipids. To test this hypothesis, the effect of dopamine on phosphoinositol lipid metabolism was investigated in frog interrenal (adrenal) tissue. In [3H]myo-inositol-prelabeled frog interrenal slices, a short pulse of dopamine (50 microM) induced a biphasic effect on inositol phosphate production: a transient (1-min) increase, followed by a sustained inhibition. Concurrently, dopamine induced a transient reduction followed by a sustained increase in polyphosphoinositides. A 10-min pulse of the D2 dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (50 microM) elicited a significant inhibition of basal levels of inositol phosphates (tris-, bis-, and mono-), and an increase in plasma membrane phosphoinositol lipid contents. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on inositol phosphate formation and corticosteroid release was abolished by a 24-h incubation of interrenal slices with pertussis toxin. In [3H]arachidonic acid-prelabeled interrenal slices, dopamine also decreased diacylglycerol (DG) and arachidonic acid (AA) concentrations. A delay of 1 min was observed between inhibition of DG and arachidonate, suggesting that AA is probably generated from DG. We conclude that in the adrenal cortex, activation of dopamine D2 receptors is coupled to a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase-C mediated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein. Taken together, our data indicate that inhibition of inositol phosphate and AA formation is one of the mechanisms by which dopamine controls corticosteroid production by adrenocortical cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have reported that the rat LH receptor is encoded by 11 exons of a single copy gene. Exons 1-10 encode the N-terminal half and exon 11 the C-terminal half. Since exon splice sites often mark structural transitions of multiexon molecules, we have attempted to define the function of the exons by generating mutant receptors with missing exons. As a first step, we have constructed two LH mutant receptors, one containing exons 1-10 (LH receptor (exon)1-10) and the other containing exon 1 and exon 11 (LH receptor(exon)1&11). These mutant receptors were functionally expressed in Cos 7A cells. The LH mutant receptor(exon)1-10, which lacks the membrane associated C-terminal half of the receptor, showed a high affinity for hCG. Surprisingly, the LH mutant receptor(exon)1&11 recognized hCG with a low affinity and stimulated G-proteins and cAMP production. The results demonstrate that exons 1-10 encode a high affinity hCG binding site and proves an important hypothesis that exon 11 encodes the site for receptor-modulation to activate G-proteins. Furthermore, the results raises an intriguing possibility of a second hormone binding site in the C-terminal half and multistep hormone binding.\r"

  ".W": "Ten adult ambulatory patients with the nonactive digestive disease short bowel syndrome were prospectively studied to quantitatively assess their free oral intake and their net digestive absorption of total calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrate during a 3-day period at least 6 months after a resection. The remaining portions of small bowel had a mean length of 75 cm (range, 0-200 cm); the remaining colon lengths had a mean of 67% of normal (range, 0%-100%). The experimental diets were formulated according to a home dietary inquiry. During the study period, pooled intakes and digestive losses were measured for total calories, fat, and protein using the bomb calorimetry, Van de Kamer, and Kjeldahl techniques, respectively. The ingested diet provided 58 +/- 14 kcal.kg-1.day-1 (mean +/- SD) and consisted of 46% carbohydrate, 31% fat, and 23% protein. Net digestive absorption was 67% +/- 12% for total calories, 79% +/- 15% for carbohydrate, 52% +/- 16% for fat, and 61% +/- 19% for protein. The larger net digestive absorption of carbohydrate (P less than or equal to 0.004) compared with fat and protein suggests salvage of colonic cholesterol in short bowel syndrome patients. It is concluded that these patients with the short bowel syndrome adapted to a hypercaloric, hyperprotein diet to compensate for increased fecal losses and that this hyperphagia does not seem to have impaired their net digestive absorption.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular immunity is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease; whether it is abnormal is not clear. The heterogeneity of patients with Crohn's disease probably underlies the disparity of reports, but attempts to determine which clinical features influence cellular immunity have been largely unsuccessful. This is probably caused by the omission of nutritional status as a potential factor, even though zinc deficiency has frequently been linked with abnormal immunity. Therefore, a detailed study of nutritional and tissue zinc status, nonspecific cellular immunity, and a measure of phagocytic function was performed in 32 patients with Crohn's disease and in a control group of 18 normal subjects and 12 patients with anorexia nervosa. Fourteen patients with Crohn's disease, all patients with anorexia nervosa, but none of the normal controls were malnourished. Peripheral blood lymphocyte population levels were normal in patients with Crohn's disease and in normal controls, but there was a small decrease in the levels of patients with anorexia nervosa. In vivo delayed hypersensitivity skin test responses were profoundly depressed in patients with anorexia nervosa and decreased in patients with Crohn's disease who were malnourished or receiving systemic glucocorticoids. In vitro lymphocyte transformation was reduced in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease, but there were only minor changes in patients with anorexia nervosa. There were alterations of in vitro immunoregulation in Crohn's disease, but they were not responsible for the abnormal lymphocyte transformation responses in malnourished patients. In vitro phagocytic function was reduced in patients with active Crohn's disease. These findings suggest that depressed in vivo and in vitro cellular immunity in malnourished patients with Crohn's disease is caused by a qualitative lymphocyte defect and that depressed in vivo but normal in vitro cellular immunity in anorexia nervosa is caused by a quantitative defect. Thus, malnutrition in Crohn's disease resembles kwashiorkor; in anorexia nervosa, it resembles marasmus. Tissue zinc status was mostly normal in Crohn's disease and anorexia nervosa, and zinc deficiency was not responsible for depressed nonspecific cellular immunity in either condition.\r"

Unequivocal seroconversion was documented in 5 transplant (9.6%) and in 26 dialysis patients (18.4%). In the dialysis population, the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was evaluated in patients grouped according to the number of blood transfusions and to the different sections of dialytic treatment. The most striking findings were the marked differences in the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies among patients treated in different sections (from 0% to 70%), and the presence of a significant increase in alanine-amino-transferase (ALT) concentrations in 14 anti-HCV negative patients. The results suggest that the diffusion of non-A, non-B hepatitis is mainly transfusion-related, with the possibility of significant environmental diffusion related to the violation of infection-control measures. The current immunoassay is probably unable to detect the actual frequency of the infection.\r"

As acute re-opening of the sternotomy is a rare occurrence our sample size was necessarily small. ANP increased following the procedure in all 3 patients, and this was significant (p less than 0.02) when compared to plasma levels obtained from 9 children who underwent sternotomy prior to elective cardiac surgery. Following acute re-opening of the sternotomy there was an increase in median urine output and a decrease in median central venous pressure. Our results illustrate that it is atrial wall stress rather than intra-atrial pressure that determines release of ANP, and in addition suggest ANP may be a factor in the rapid clinical improvement following delayed sternal closure for atypical tamponade in children.\r"

In June 1990, the Supreme Court upheld an individual's right to refuse life-prolonging procedures, provided those wishes had been clearly documented. This decision, and The American Dietetic Association's 1987 guidelines for feeding the terminally ill, may enable dietitians to evaluate complicated situations regarding feeding and nonfeeding of patients. A survey sent to 590 registered dietitians in The American Dietetic Association's Nutrition Support dietetic practice group resulted in a 42% (n = 250) response rate. In general, dietitians were more willing to discontinue total parenteral nutrition than to discontinue enteral, noninvasive enteral, or oral feedings. They thought that feeding could be discontinued if it causes pain or worsens the condition, if death is imminent, or if the patient has requested that feeding be stopped. University courses and continuing education programs on the ethics and legalities of feeding terminally or critically ill adults will enable dietitians to take active roles in the decision-making process and to promote awareness of relevant issues with patients and families.\r"

  ".W": "Essential amino acids, found in abundance in high-quality dietary protein, are required daily by hospitalized patients and healthy persons to maintain the dynamic process of protein metabolism. One method for assessing dietary protein quality is by determining a diet's chemical score, ie, the ratio of a gram of the limiting amino acid in a test diet to the same amount of the corresponding amino acid in a reference diet (eg, whole-egg protein) multiplied by 100. This investigation used the chemical score to evaluate the protein quality of 9 parenteral and 17 enteral diets commonly used to feed hospitalized patients. Standard parenteral and enteral products (ie, formulas that had not been designed for patients with a specific disease state) had chemical scores that ranged from 46% to 70%. Limiting amino acids were either methionine (plus cysteine) or phenylalanine (plus tyrosine). Products designed for patients with renal failure had the highest scores, which ranged from 85% to 145%. Products that were enriched with branched-chain amino acids for trauma patients had scores that ranged from 38% to 73%. The only product available for patients with pulmonary compromise had a score of 50%. The lowest scores, which ranged from 5% to 13%, were found in products for patients with hepatic failure. All products, except those with chemical scores below 13%, may be fed in relatively small amounts of protein (7 to 33 g) to satisfy the minimum daily requirements of essential amino acids, although such levels would not meet minimal daily nitrogen requirements. We recommend that dietitians use the chemical score to assess the protein quality of parenteral and enteral diets.\r"

Dietary fiber consists of water-soluble and insoluble plant compounds that are resistant to digestion by small-bowel enzymes but are fermented to varying degrees by colonic bacteria. Many physiologic effects of fiber may be related to the degree of fermentation. Few controlled studies of fiber-containing tube feedings have been performed. These studies have limitations and are nondefinitive as to whether fiber prevents or controls constipation/diarrhea. Constipation in tube-fed patients has not been shown to respond to mixed soluble/insoluble fiber in the few studies performed to date. Likewise, fiber may be of only limited benefit in controlling diarrhea in acute illness because of such factors as stress or medication. Fiber does play a role in maintaining gut integrity in all patients, whether they have diarrhea or not. Fiber may be recommended as part of a standard tube-feeding regimen to help assure gut mucosal integrity but not specifically to treat constipation/diarrhea. Further studies are necessary before the role of fiber in the management of constipation/diarrhea in tube-fed patients is determined.\r"

  ".W": "O-specific polysaccharide (O-PS) isolated from serotype 18 Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was covalently coupled to either Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin A (TA) or or cholera toxin (CT). The conjugates were nontoxic and nonpyrogenic. The conjugates were well tolerated on parenteral administration to human volunteers, with only mild, transient local reactions reported. Immunization engendered an IgG antibody response to both the O-PS and carrier protein. Anti-LPS antibody promoted the uptake and killing of an E. coli O18 strain bearing the K1 capsule by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which was complement dependent. Antibody to carrier protein neutralized the activity of native TA or CT in cell culture assays. Passively transferred IgG isolated from the serum of immunized donors provided a significant (P less than .01) degree of protection against fatal experimental E. coli O18 sepsis in mice. This study illustrates the potential use of such conjugates as vaccines against E. coli extraintestinal infections.\r"

The H-IVIG was more effective at promoting the opsonophagocytic killing of P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella vaccine serotype strains than normal IVIG. The H-IVIG neutralized greater than 20 times more toxin A than commercial IVIG. Only the H-IVIG offered significant protection against Klebsiella K2 sepsis. The H-IVIG provided significantly better protection against six of the eight P. aeruginosa vaccine serotypes than normal IVIG when compared in a murine burn wound sepsis model. The H-IVIG also protected mice against an Enterobacter aerogenes challenge, whereas normal IVIG was ineffective.\r"

Twenty placentas were evaluated by combined immunochemical and in situ hybridization techniques, using a 35S-labeled RNA probe complementary to the 3' long terminal repeat and envelope region of HIV-1. HIV-seropositive placentas did not show significant villitis; however, the incidence of chorioamnionitis increased (P less than .01). HIV antigens and nucleic acids were identified in the trophoblast of 10% of the placentas that also showed chorionitis. Term HIV-positive placentas may show histologic changes that may or may not be directly related to the virus. Analysis of tissues from earlier gestational placentas may prove more informative in clarifying the mechanism of maternal-fetal HIV transmission.\r"

Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R were greatly elevated, but sCD8 concentrations were not. These levels increased with disease severity and were associated with fatal outcomes. Macrophage activation by high concentrations of the cytokine IFN-gamma may contribute to pathophysiology and death in septicemic patients. Both IFN-gamma and sIL-2R seem to be predictive of outcome in patients with severe melioidosis and may prove useful in detection of relapse.\r"

M. fortuitum was isolated from five patients; four isolates that were evaluated further were M. fortuitum biovariant fortuitum. EMG procedures were done in one laboratory by one physician and assistant. Standard procedures included use of reusable needle electrodes disinfected with 2% glutaraldehyde and then rinsed with tap water. On recognition of the outbreak, the procedure was changed to include autoclaving of needle electrodes. Active surveillance for 1 year revealed no further cases. M. fortuitum could not be isolated from the laboratory, EMG equipment and reagents, or skin of the medical personnel. The outbreak demonstrates that nontuberculous mycobacterial infection may be associated with EMG.\r"

A combination therapy was tested consisting of a subcurative dose of chloroquine and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in BALB/c mice with lethal Plasmodium vinckei malaria. Treatment with either agent alone prolonged median survival by 1-2 days compared with placebo-treated mice. However, a combination of 80 micrograms of chloroquine given at the time of infection plus 1 x 10(4) units of IFN-gamma/day for 11 days (starting 3 days before infection) cured 83% of infected mice. Moreover, these mice showed solid immunity when challenged with the homologous strain of P. vinckei. However, when these mice were infected with the heterologous strain of Plasmodium berghei, the same degree of parasitemia developed as did in P. berghei-infected control mice. Thus, the combination of chemotherapy with the cytokine IFN-gamma leads to substantial improvement of antimalarial treatment and to a rapid development of strain-specific immunity in murine P. vinckei malaria.\r"

None were on antiretroviral therapy. Only 3% had a positive CSF HIV p24 antigen test. The CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels increased as the CD4+ T cell count decreased. Intrathecal production of beta 2-microglobulin was suggested by finding CSF concentrations greater than serum concentrations in 15% of patients. The CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels rose as in vitro T helper cell function deteriorated, independent of CD4+ T cell count. CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels paralleled CSF IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis. Higher CSF beta 2-microglobulin levels were found in persons with positive CSF oligoclonal bands. CSF beta 2-microglobulin concentration may serve as a marker for subclinical neurologic damage due to HIV. If this is established, defining the effect of anti-HIV interventions on CSF beta 2-microglobulin would be warranted.\r"

How intravascular filarial parasites avoid precipitating thrombosis has not been studied in detail. We hypothesized that extracts of Brugia malayi microfilariae would contain factors that inhibit activation of hemostatic mechanisms. Initial studies demonstrated an inhibitor specific for the intrinsic coagulation cascade. The addition of microfilarial extracts to human plasma prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time in a dose-dependent fashion but did not prolong the prothrombin, thrombin, or Russell's viper venom times. Microfilarial extracts (0.1 mg/ml) completely inhibited activation of Hageman factor (factor XII, at 0.05 U/ml) as measured in an amidolytic assay. Hageman factor previously activated by ellagic acid (factor XIIa) retained full enzymatic activity in the presence of microfilarial extract (0.1 mg/ml). The presence of inhibitory activity in the culture medium of live parasites raises the possibility that microfilariae secrete an inhibitory protein into their local environment. Microfilarial extracts at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml also inhibited collagen- and adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation. Arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by microfilarial extracts at a final concentration of 0.6 mg/ml. These results suggest that microfilariae of Brugia malayi, a human filarial parasite, may avoid initiating thrombosis through inhibition of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and platelet aggregation.\r"

Compared with normal laboratory controls, the patients with heart failure had a moderate reduction (greater than 60%) in skeletal muscle citrate synthase and a marked reduction (greater than 90%) in succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase (all p less than 0.001). Depression of aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle is associated with severe chronic heart failure and is likely one of the contributory factors for impaired exercise capacity seen in the advanced stages of this condition.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) to adhere to cells of the upper and lower airways is considered the initial step in its colonization and subsequent infection. Many potential adhesins exist, but few eukaryote receptors have been reported. This study evaluates the adherence of PA and the well-recognized adhesin mucoexopolysaccharide, of the mucoid variant, to tracheal epithelial cells and airway secretions. A number of tools were used to systematically examine this process, each in increasing detail. Scanning electron microscopy of infected tracheal cell monolayers showed that although nonmucoid PA adhered most often as individual organisms, mucoid strains frequently were adherent in the form of clusters of microcolonies. Partially purified mucoexopolysaccharide was itself adherent to the tracheal cell monolayers. More quantitative studies of carbon 14-labeled PA adherence to tracheal cell monolayers demonstrated that (1) bacterial adherence was temperature dependent; (2) mucoid PA was more adherent than nonmucoid PA (p less than 0.005); (3) proteinase treatment of the intact monolayers increased adherence of mucoid PA; and (4) adherence of nonmucoid PA was partially inhibited by pretreatment with N-acetylglucosamine, a normal constituent of airway mucus (control, 9.5 +/- 2.0 bacteria/cell; N-acetylglucosamine, 5.8 +/- 1.5 bacteria/cell; p = 0.05). These observations suggest that N-acetylglucosamine may play a role in the epithelial cell receptor for ligands on the surface of nonmucoid strains of PA. Pretreatment of mucoid PA with N-acetylglucosamine, D-arabinose, D-mannose, or N-acetylneuraminic acid did not affect adherence. Partially purified proteins isolated from the apical plasma membrane of bovine tracheal epithelial cells probed in a Western analysis with the iodine 125-labeled PA mucoexopolysaccharide revealed two binding proteins of 45,000 mol wt and 104,000 mol wt. Human airway secretions of patients with chronic PA infection were screened by the dot blot technique and demonstrated selective binding of mucoexopolysaccharide ligand. Western analysis of these biologically important secretions revealed that PA mucoexopolysaccharide bound to a 65,000 mol wt protein in airway secretions of infected individuals. This glycoprotein is similar to a previously described cell receptor for bacterial type 1 fimbriae.\r"

Courses were repeated every 4-6 weeks for a total of 12 courses. After the completion of 12 courses, responding patients received continuous treatment with chlorambucil (3 mg m-2 d-1) and prednisone (6 mg m-2 d-1) until relapse. Following the induction, 23 of 31 evaluated patients (74%) have responded to induction therapy of whom eight (26% of the 31 evaluated patients) achieved complete remission defined as disappearance of all clinical and laboratory features characteristic of WM. The overall median response duration, as of December 1988, has not yet been reached, while the overall median event-free survival duration for the entire population and for responding patients is 66 months in both groups. However, in responding patients the event-free survival duration after 66 months reaches a plateau. Toxicity was limited to transient nausea and vomiting (grade 2 according to WHO). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of an oral polychemotherapeutic treatment in the management of Waldenstrom's disease.\r"

No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine. Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital.\r"

Several independent measures of severity of illness (length of stay, duration of fever, Physiologic Severity Index) showed that patients with bacterial meningitis and those with encephalitis (DRG 20) were more ill than those with aseptic meningitis (DRG 21) (p less than 0.001 for each measure). Cost analysis revealed that the hospital was only partially reimbursed for its charges (shortfall of $95,547) and that patients with Medicaid or no insurance accounted for 22% of discharges but 88% of losses. Reimbursement by DRG would have increased payment for DRG 21 but decreased that for DRG 20. If DRGs were applied to pediatric central nervous system infections and used in a prospective payment system, they would accurately predict disease severity between but not within groups, and significant financial losses for children's hospitals would still occur.\r"

  ".W": "We report that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) inhibits electrically induced cholinergic twitches of longitudinal muscle in whole intestinal segments and myenteric-plexus longitudinal muscle (MPLM) strips from the guinea pig ileum. To elucidate the possible presynaptic mechanism of ANF's action, we studied spontaneous and stimulation-evoked radiolabeled acetylcholine (ACh) outflow from MPLM after incubation with [3H]choline. We developed a method of mounting and treating MPLM preparations, which allowed us, at the same time, to record isometric contractions and to determine [3H]ACh outflow upon electrical stimulation by a train of three pulses. ANF (5 x 10(-8) M), norepinephrine (2 x 10(-7) M) and 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (10(-3) M) in nearly equieffective concentrations caused a similar inhibition of cholinergic twitches. However, ANF had no effect on [3H]ACh outflow, whereas norepinephrine was found to suppress [3H]ACh outflow and 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cGMP to enhanced [3H]ACh outflow. ANF (5 x 10(-8) M) caused a 7.0-fold increase of cGMP over control values, predominantly in muscle layers, whereas Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin (12.5 U/ml) elicited a 35-fold increment of cGMP in the extramuscular layer. Thus, ANF is able to elevate cGMP in intestinal smooth muscle and to inhibit cholinergic contractions of MPLM. This inhibition is mimicked by exogenous cGMP and by endogenously generated cyclic nucleotides. We suggest that the depressive action of ANF on cholinergic contractions of MPLM is mediated via its postsynaptic impact implicating elevation of cGMP in smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Aminoalkylindoles (AAIs) are antinociceptive agents which act through two distinct mechanisms: inhibition of cyclooxygenase and a novel mechanism retained by AAI analogs which do not inhibit cyclooxygenase. This latter mechanism is reflected by inhibition of neuronally mediated contractions in several smooth muscle bioassays. The present studies explored the potential receptor interactions of AAIs in smooth muscle preparations and in rat brain membranes. Experiments in an electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens preparation (MVD) demonstrated that several AAI agonists inhibited neuronally mediated muscle contractions over a wide potency range (0.1-1000 nM) and in a stereospecific manner. Also, a putative AAI antagonist analog selectively attenuated AAI-induced inhibition in the MVD: 10 microM of the antagonist analog produced 16- to 40-fold rightward shifts in the concentration-effect curves for AAI agonists but failed to attenuate the inhibitory actions of several receptor agonists and other pharmacological agents. AAI agonists also inhibited adenylyl cyclase in membranes from rat striatum and cerebellum. AAI agonists inhibited adenylyl cyclase through G-proteins, because AAI-inhibited adenylyl cyclase required GTP, and was not supported by nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotides. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by several AAI agonists was stereospecific and was not blocked by antagonists of several traditional neurotransmitter receptors. The potencies of AAI agonists to inhibit cerebellar adenylyl cyclase were highly correlated (r = 0.97) with their potencies to inhibit contractions of MVD. These results suggest that AAIs bind to specific receptors which are coupled through G-proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion of substrate via only the hepatic artery with simultaneous substrate-free perfusion of portal vein or hepatic vein [hepatic artery portal vein-hepatic artery hepatic vein] was used to examine the enzymic distribution of carboxylesterases towards the hydrolysis of enalapril to enalaprilat in the perfused rat liver preparation. In this single-pass method, [14C]enalapril was delivered by the hepatic artery at 2 ml/min into the liver, whereas drug-free perfusate entered the portal vein or hepatic vein at 10 ml/min for HAPV and HAHV perfusions, respectively. During steady state, a multiple indicator dose of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells (vascular marker), [58Co]EDTA (interstitial space marker, which behaves similarly to labeled tracer sucrose), and 3H2O was given into the hepatic artery. Labeled enalapril and the reference indicators entering via the hepatic artery will reach virtually all sinusoidal spaces during HAPV, and will be confined to the peripheral region during HAHV. By defining the steady-state extraction ratios of enalapril (Etot) and segregating the components of biliary excretion and metabolism, and by assessing the intracellular water spaces and the corresponding transit times during HPAV and HAHV, the metabolic sequestration rate constant (metabolic intrinsic clearance per unit accessible cell water space) for the periportal region/whole liver (HAHV/HAPV) was 0.344. The data suggest that the carboxylesterase activity for enalapril conversion to enalaprilat is primarily localized in the perihepatic venous region of the rat liver.\r"

  ".W": "The objective was to determine the existence of a glybenclamide-sensitive K+ conductance in intestinal smooth muscle, to study a possible role for this conductance in the generation of colonic slow wave type action potentials and to investigate if modification of this conductance could alter the action potentials and hence colonic motility. Intracellular electrical recording techniques were used to study properties of cells from the network of smooth muscle cells and interstitial cells of Cajal at the submucosal border of the circular muscle layer of the canine colon, where colonic pacemaker activity is generated. Cromakalim, dose dependently, hyperpolarized the cells and decreased the duration of the action potential, thereby inhibiting contractile activity. The upstroke amplitude and the action potential frequency remained unaltered. Glybenclamide did not affect any parameter of spontaneous electrical activity but prevented all effects of cromakalim. Cromakalim seems to act through increase in K+ conductance because the cromakalim-induced hyperpolarization is accompanied by a marked reduction in input resistance, is inhibited by glybenclamide and tetraethylammonium and it is shown that the cromakalim effect does not occur through effects on Na+ or Cl- conductances. Thus, glybenclamide-sensitive K+ conductance exists in colonic smooth muscle; the spontaneous development of slow wave type action potentials in this tissue occurs independent of this conductance. Its existence may provide pharmacological possibilities to affect gastrointestinal motility.\r"

  ".U": "91211084\r", 
  ".W": "Inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2 with aspirin enhances the response to coronary thrombolysis. However, experimental evidence suggests that platelet activation during coronary thrombolysis is mediated by a number of agonists, in addition to TXA2. As a consequence, greater benefit would be expected with antiplatelet agents that have a broader spectrum of activity. However, a recent clinical trial, combining tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with the prostacyclin analog, iloprost, did not detect such a benefit. To address the mechanism of this response, we compared the effect of iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, with GR32191, a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, on the response to i.v. t-PA in a closed chest, canine model of coronary thrombosis. GR32191 reduced the time to reperfusion by 47% (n = 6, P less than .05), consistent with a role for TXA2-mediated platelet activation in impairing thrombolysis. In contrast, iloprost increased the time to reperfusion by 50% (n = 5, P = NS) and in four of nine animals reperfusion failed to occur despite inhibition of platelet aggregation. In a separate series of experiments, steady-state plasma t-PA clearance increased by 38% (407 +/- 49 vs. 294 +/- 42 ml/min; n = 8, P less than .02) during infusion of iloprost and recovered after its withdrawal. This appeared to be a specific effect, as infusion of nitroglycerin at a dose which induced a similar fall in blood pressure altered neither the time to reperfusion nor plasma t-PA. Iloprost impairs the thrombolytic response to t-PA via an increase in the clearance of this agent.\r"

Alkaline extraction of insoluble S. glucanicum exopolymers produced a soluble scleroglucan composed of a triple-helical beta-1,3-linked glucopyranose backbone with single beta-1,6-linked glucopyranosyl branches every third subunit. Scleroglucan has a weight average molecular mass of 1.56 x 10(6) Da, a weight average root mean square distance from the center of gravity of the molecule to its farthest elements of 51.8 nm, a polydispersity (weight-average molecular mass/number average molecular mass) of 1.83 and intrinsic viscosity of 3.081 dl/g. Scleroglucan (250 mg/kg, intravenously) stimulated in vivo murine macrophage phagocytic activity (66%, P less than .001) and increased in vitro macrophage tumor cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor targets by 124% (P less than .05). Scleroglucan enhanced (P less than .001) murine bone marrow proliferation in a biphasic manner by up to 328%. Scleroglucan therapy increased survival of mice challenged with syngeneic lymphoma, melanoma or adenocarcinoma. AKR/J mice bearing syngeneic lymphoma (1 x 10(3) cells, intraperitoneally) demonstrated increased (P less than .001) long-term survival (100% vs. 0%, greater than 64 days). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic melanoma B16 (5 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased long-term survival (64% vs. 0%, P less than .05). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic adenocarcinoma BW10232 (1 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased (P less than .05) median survival time. In addition, scleroglucan prophylaxis increased resistance of mice to challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and mouse hepatitis virus A-59. Scleroglucan did not induce toxicity or hepatomegaly. We conclude that: 1) a branched, water-soluble beta-1,3-linked scleroglucan biologic response modifier can be extracted from S. glucanicum; 2) scleroglucan will stimulate immunity, modify experimental neoplastic disease and increase resistance to microbial challenge; and 3) scleroglucan shows promise as an immunopotentiating drug.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in oxytocin secretion was investigated in this study. Pharmacologic agents that influence serotonergic transmission were administered to conscious unrestrained male rats 30 min prior to sacrifice and plasma oxytocin concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. The d- and l-stereoisomers of the 5-HT releaser fenfluramine significantly increased plasma oxytocin in a dose-dependent manner. Oxytocin secretion was more potently stimulated by d-fenfluramine than by l-fenfluramine. The 5-HT releaser p-chloroamphetamine also increased plasma oxytocin. The following 5-HT agonists increased plasma oxytocin concentration: the 5-HT1&2 agonist m-chlorophenyl-piperazine [10-20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)], the 5-HT1C&2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-l-phenyl)-2-aminopropane (0.5-2.0 mg/kg i.p.) and the 5-HT1&2 agonist 1-piperazinyl-6-chloropyrazine (10 mg/kg i.p.). In contrast, the 5-HT1AB agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (0.2-5.0 mg/kg i.p.) did not increase oxytocin secretion. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1C&2 antagonist, 6-(2-(4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl)ethyl)-7-methyl-5H- thiazolo(3(1)2-a)pyrimidin-5-one [2.5 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)], 60 min before injection of 1-piperazinyl-6-chloropyrazine attenuated, but did not completely block, 1-piperazinyl-6-chloropyrazine-induced secretion of oxytocin. Both low and high (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg s.c.) doses of 6-(2-(4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl)ethyl)-7-methyl-5H- thiazolo(3(1)2-a)pyrimidin-5-one or the 5-HT2 antagonist spiperone inhibited the 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-l-phenyl)-2-aminopropane-induced increases in plasma oxytocin. These studies provide evidence that enhanced serotonergic transmission stimulates oxytocin secretion and that 5-HT2 receptors contribute to this effect.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of opiate administration regimens, 32 patients with multiple rib fractures were prospectively randomized to receive either continuous epidural (ED) or continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of fentanyl. Dosage was titrated to individual subjective pain relief. Ventilatory function tests (VFTs), arterial blood gases (ABGs), and visual analog scores were obtained before and after the institution of analgesia. Post-analgesia values were compared with pre-analgesia values using a two-tailed paired t-test looking for significant changes produced by the analgesic method. Both methods significantly improved analog pain scores. The ED method produced improvement in both maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and vital capacity (VC), whereas IV analgesia only produced improvement in VC. Intravenous fentanyl produced increases in PaCO2 and decreases in PaO2, whereas no significant changes in ABGs were observed with ED fentanyl administration. Side effects were similar between the groups, with pruritus being more pronounced with ED fentanyl administration. The data demonstrate that the continuous ED fentanyl method offers excellent relief of pain and improvement in ventilatory function and has distinct advantages over IV fentanyl administration with respect to changes in ABGs and MIP. The continuous infusion of epidural opiates should be the preferred analgesic method for patients at high risk of developing pulmonary complications following multiple rib fractures.\r"

Two databases were used in this study: 1) estimated costs for all inpatient claims from one large payor for adult injured patients (n = 5,256) treated at 79 acute care facilities (trauma centers and non-trauma centers) in one geographic region; and 2) hospital charges from statewide, all-payor Maryland data, including 25,987 adult injured patients. The accuracy of PMCs and DRGs in predicting actual costs was examined by level of injury severity and by types of hospital, trauma center vs. non-trauma center. Level of injury (minor, single significant, multiple significant, and major) were defined and operationalized using PMCs. Overall, both DRG and PMC payment systems were nearly equal to the actual costs associated with all injured patients. This relationship can be designed into the weighting scale used for payment. The distribution of DRG payments by injury severity level, however, is not reflective of the differential resources required to manage each patient type. In particular, multiple injuries and major injuries that require the specialized services of a trauma center were inaccurately categorized by DRGs and systematically underpaid by 21.0% to 39.0% by DRG payment. By contrast, the Patient Management Category System classifies patients into more clinically specific and accurate categories and offers a more equitable method of distributing payments by injury severity. These same relationships were also found at the hospital level, demonstrating the potential for use of PMCs as an equitable and viable alternative.\r"

Patients (7 men, 3 women; mean age 40 years, range 23-54) all had biopsy-proven chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis and were repeatedly positive for antibodies to hepatitis C virus. Treatment was with oral ribavirin 1000-1200 mg per day in two divided doses for 12 weeks. The median serum alanine aminotransferase concentration for all patients at enrollment was 3.15 mu kat/l (range 1.22-7.79) and decreased significantly (p less than 0.005) to 1.25 mu kat/l (0.78-2.04) after 12 weeks of treatment. Within 6 weeks of the end of treatment the median serum alanine aminotransferase concentration was not significantly different from that before treatment. Side-effects were mild and fully reversible after cessation of therapy. We conclude that ribavirin is the first drug to offer a potentially effective oral treatment for chronic hepatitis C.

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. In normal subjects, chronic hyperventilation lowers plasma bicarbonate concentration, primarily by inhibiting the urinary excretion of net acid. The quantitative relation between reduced arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and the plasma bicarbonate concentration in the chronic steady state has not been studied in humans, however, and the laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of chronic respiratory alkalosis therefore remain undefined. We wished to provide such reference data for clinical use. Moreover, because chronic hyperventilation paradoxically lowers blood pH still further in dogs with metabolic acidosis, we desired to study the effect of chronic hypocapnia on the plasma bicarbonate concentration (and blood pH) in normal human subjects in whom acidosis had been induced with ammonium chloride. METHODS. Under metabolic-balance conditions, we used altitude-induced hypobaric hypoxia to produce chronic hypocapnia in nine normal young men, five of whom received ammonium chloride daily to cause metabolic acidosis (the mean [+/- SE] steady-state plasma bicarbonate level in these five was 12.0 +/- 0.5 mmol per liter). RESULTS. For each decrease of 1 mm Hg (0.13 kPa) in the PaCO2, the plasma bicarbonate concentration decreased by 0.41 mmol per liter in the subjects who started with a normal plasma bicarbonate concentration and by 0.42 mmol per liter in the subjects with acidosis. In contrast to the findings in previous studies of dogs, hypocapnia increased blood pH similarly in both groups; the blood hydrogen ion concentration decreased by about 0.4 nmol per liter for every decrease of 1 mm Hg (0.13 kPa) in PaCO2. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide reference data for the diagnosis of chronic respiratory alkalosis in humans. Although chronic hypocapnia decreased plasma bicarbonate levels similarly in normal subjects with acidosis and without acidosis, the percent reduction in PaCO2 was always greater than the corresponding percent reduction in the plasma bicarbonate concentration. Therefore, as was not true of the response in dogs, the subjects' blood pH always increased with hyperventilation, regardless of the initial plasma bicarbonate concentration.\r"

  ".W": "Bleeding from esophagogastric varices carries a high mortality rate. Active variceal bleeding can usually be temporarily controlled medically with a combination of intravenous vasopressin and nitroglycerin, with balloon tamponade, or with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Because of the high likelihood of recurrence, long-term treatment, such as repeated sclerotherapy, propranolol therapy, or shunt surgery, is necessary. The proper selection of such measures requires consideration of the site of variceal bleeding, local availability of specialized techniques, and patient factors. Only liver transplantation reverses the liver damage and offers hope of improved long-term survival. As success at identifying high-risk patients by endoscopic features improves, propranolol or other pharmacologic prophylaxis may become an acceptable treatment.\r"

The most visible components of the public information and education programs are the National Public Information Campaign (\"America Responds to AIDS\"), the National AIDS Hotline system, and the National AIDS Information Clearinghouse. Components of the youth education program consist of funding for national health and education organizations, funding for State and local education departments, training, surveillance of education efforts, and evaluation. Counseling and testing has entailed performance of approximately 2,500,000 HIV antibody tests with pre- and post-test counseling, notification and counseling of sexual and needle-sharing partners of those infected with HIV, and targeted risk reduction education through community-based organizations. Over time, these activities will continue to evolve and become more effective.\r"

They completed a structured interview that included questions on their knowledge of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) transmission and prevention. Hispanic patients were interviewed in their preferred language. They were given a cumulative correct score for 10 questions on AIDS. An ANOVA showed significant differences in knowledge between each radial group. Cumulative scores were whites, 78 percent correct; blacks, 68 percent correct; and Hispanics, 61 percent correct. Only 58 percent of Hispanics reported that using a condom during sexual intercourse lowered the risk of contracting AIDS, compared with 84 percent of whites and 83 percent of blacks. A regression analysis showed significant effects for both education and racial group, but not for age and sex. These findings show that knowledge of AIDS can be predicted according to the race and education of the population using these community health centers. Additional attention should be focused on educating low-income blacks and Hispanics about AIDS.\r"

The ultimate intent of these intervention efforts was to decrease viral transmission. To assess residents' knowledge and attitudes regarding AIDS, a statewide, random telephone study was conducted by AIDS Program personnel in the fall of 1987, 1988, and 1989, with technical assistance from the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, University of North Dakota. Study results indicated a majority of the respondents considered themselves to have at least \"some\" knowledge about AIDS. Participants' comprehension of viral transmission routes and prevention methods increased over the 3 years, yet misconceptions still exist. Identified areas of misconception were accentuated in subsequent State educational programs. When the results were compared with national studies, knowledge levels in North Dakota were generally similar to but frequently superior to the nationwide levels.\r"

This study, using interview data obtained in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area household survey, compares racial differences in alcohol use and abuse among a sample of 2,100 women. After controlling for differences in sociodemographic characteristics, black women were found to be at no greater risk than whites for heavy drinking or for suffering from alcohol abuse or dependence. Racial differences, however, were observed in heavy drinking by years of education. A similar percentage of black women and white women who had not completed high school were heavy drinkers, but black women with 12 or more years of education were less likely to be heavy drinkers than whites with comparable education. These findings raise questions about the extent to which differences in drinking contribute to the poorer alcohol-related health outcomes of black women in Baltimore. Additionally, the finding that education was inversely related to heavy drinking among black women may be helpful in shaping early alcohol abuse intervention and treatment services that target black women.\r"

The authors examine the benefits of this type of analysis when applied to public health organizations and present a series of questions that should be answered prior to committing resources to scanning, monitoring, forecasting, and assessing components of the macroenvironment. Using illustrations from the public and private sectors, each question is examined with reference to specific challenges facing public health. Benefits are derived both from the process and the outcome of macroenvironmental analysis. Not only are data acquired that assist public health professionals to make decisions, but the analytical process required assures a better understanding of potential external threats and opportunities as well as an organization's strengths and weaknesses. Although differences exist among private and public as well as profit and not-for-profit organizations, macroenvironmental analysis is seen as more essential to the public and not-for-profit sectors than the private and profit sectors. This conclusion results from the extreme dependency of those areas on external environmental forces that cannot be significantly influenced or controlled by public health decision makers.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid proliferation of registries has occurred during the last 20 years. Given the long-term commitment of resources associated with registries and limited public health funding, proposals for new registries should be carefully considered before being funded. A registry is defined as a data base of identifiable persons containing a clearly defined set of health and demographic data collected for a specific public health purpose. Criteria for evaluating whether a registry is needed, feasible, or the most effective and efficient means of collecting a specific set of health data are presented. They include an evaluation of the stated purpose; a review of the function, duration, and scope of the registry; consideration of existing alternative data sources; an assessment of the practical feasibility of the registry; the likelihood of sufficient start-up and long-term funding; and an evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the registry. Creating a public health registry is a complex process. A range of technical and organizational skills is required for a registry to be successfully implemented. Eight requirements are identified as crucial for the successful development of a new registry. They include an implementation plan, adequate documentation, quality control procedures, case definition and case-finding (ascertainment) procedures, determination of data elements, data collection and processing procedures, data access policy, and a framework for dissemination of registry data and findings.\r"

  ".W": "All 50 States have passed legislation to protect elderly victims of domestic abuse and neglect. Forty-two States have mandatory reporting laws, with health care providers considered the major professional referral service.This exploratory study of State health departments had as its goals (a) the identification of administrative awareness regarding the State law, (b) the perception of difficulties encountered in the reporting process, and (c) the development of procedures, such as written materials or training curriculum, to assist health personnel with the reporting responsibilities. The study was carried out between April and October 1989. A brief questionnaire was mailed to State health department directors. All 50 States responded, although the respondents represented varying disciplines and staff responsibilities within the health departments or were from agencies that the State had designated to investigate elder abuse. These data should be considered preliminary and suggestive of service needs. The results demonstrated an inverse relationship between awareness of the laws or regulations and specific activities to support the reporting process. Ninety-four percent of respondents were aware of the State law, but only 20 to 28 percent reported the use of written procedures or training materials specifically designed for health personnel. At the same time, approximately one-third were aware of reporting issues that needed to be addressed, including staff unfamiliarity with the regulations, concerns of confidentiality, and uneasiness about reporting in general. Part of the reason for what appears to be inactivity on the part of the State departments of health may lie in the fact that elder abuse reporting laws tend to place implementing authority with human service, aging, or law enforcement agencies rather than with health departments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 1988, nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding organ and tissue donation and transplantation were assessed using a 70-item questionnaire. Respondents included 1,683 nurses employed in 62 rural and urban hospitals in the Midwest. Only 365 respondents (21.7 percent) reported having requested tissue donations and 243 (14.4 percent) reported having requested organ donations. However, of those who requested tissue or organ donations, 270 (74 percent) obtained consents for tissues and 150 (61.7 percent) obtained consent for organ donations. Respondents were knowledgeable about organ and tissue donation (mean score of 7.5 on a 0 to 10 knowledge scale with 10 as highest) and reported attitudes and beliefs were moderately positive. Factors that were significantly correlated with the number of requests made for organs and tissues and the number of consents obtained included nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about donation; nurses' perception of their own confidence in their ability to request tissues and organs; being a supervisor; and working in an emergency department.\r"

Mean serum cholesterol for the sample (mean age 33.6 years) was 208.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dL). Cholesterol level increased with age, decreased with education, and was higher in men than in women. Using the Navy's own risk cutpoints for total cholesterol (200 mg per dL for ages 18-24, 220 mg per dL for ages 25 and older), 36.9 percent of the sample were found to be at risk. When the percentage of the population at risk was computed using the guidelines suggested by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference, rather than the Navy's cutpoints, results were almost identical (36.3 percent at risk); when based on the National Cholesterol Education Program's recommended cutpoints, the percent at risk was considerably higher (55.4 percent). Risk estimates that included LDL- or HDL-cholesterol risk levels (or both) also were higher. A larger percentage of Navy personnel were at risk because of total cholesterol than were persons in an age-adjusted national sample. However, because routine examinations generally are not given until first reenlistment, the Navy sample underrepresented younger service members, and results may overestimate the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in the Navy at large. The author draws attention to the problem of lack of standardization in cholesterol testing and notes that the Navy does not yet participate in an external quality control program. The difficulty in setting appropriate risk cutpoints, given the complexity of factors that must be considered as well as the general unreliability of cholesterol tests, is also discussed.\r"

Not all persons who are program-eligible are at equal risk, however. It would be desirable to evaluate a program's ability to enroll persons from higher risk backgrounds in the population (coverage) and, conversely, the extent to which those enrolled in this program are at higher risk (targeting). A method for the evaluation of coverage and targeting was developed using data from the Tennessee Women, Infants, and Children Special Supplemental Food Program (WIC) linked with birth certificates. The linked computer file was created by matching the name and date of birth in both record files. The birth records were the common source of information used to characterize the risk background for both the WIC and non-WIC participants. Maternal sociodemographic information on the birth records was used to define the health risk background of each child. The coverage and targeting of \"at-risk\" children were computed and compared for 50 counties or county-aggregates in Tennessee. Considerable variation in the coverage and targeting rates of at-risk children was observed among Tennessee counties, although the counties within each WIC administrative region tended to have similar coverage and targeting patterns. Using the existing data in linked program and vital records provides a direct evaluation of a program. Coverage and targeting evaluation can be used to detect underserved populations within small geographic areas.\r"

Although school was the dominant setting (35 percent), particularly for younger respondents 20-34 years (55 percent), the workplace was also an important setting for uptake of regular smoking. Overall, 34 percent reported taking up smoking while in a job. The probability of taking up smoking at work increased with age but, even among younger respondents, many did not begin smoking until they started work. Fourteen percent took it up between leaving school and commencing college or a university or their first job, and 22 percent of those who attended college or a university took up smoking in that setting. One-quarter of the sample said that nobody had influenced them to take up smoking, but most of the remainder indicated that either friends, family, or workmates had played a part. Most mentioned were good friends at school (20 percent), good friends known socially (14 percent), and good friends at work (7 percent). Others listed were family (7 percent), boy friend or girl friend (7 percent). Overall, 10 percent had taken up regular smoking under the influence of workmates at work, suggesting that smoke-free workplace policies might be useful in the long term in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the community.\r"

The failure of traditional health promotion approaches to poor communities has created a literature supporting community-based action directed at broad social forces. The Codman Square Community Partnership for Health Promotion uses a variety of models--community participation, community organization, empowerment education, and community-oriented primary care--to encourage new coalitions that can ameliorate the social isolation and health-averse social norms linked to poverty and poor health. The program uses local residents trained as lay health workers to deliver home-based health services and to help create the necessary partnerships, linkages, and communication networks to foster the reorganization of the community to better address its health problems.\r"

A comprehensive program in Wilmington, OH, will incorporate the use of the community senior citizens' center, the local college, fire department, local radio stations and newspapers, community churches, local merchants, educators, and the medical community. Extrinsic factors that previously have been linked directly to falls will be identified in the home inspections. The \"Fixer-Up-Team,\" composed of college students and community volunteers, will rectify any unsafe conditions found by the inspection team. Local merchants and lumber yards will donate materials to make needed repairs. Active senior citizens will be trained as part of the inspection team, allowing this program to be self-perpetuating. Compared with the national prevalence rates, this program will show a decrease in injuries caused by falls in the homes of the participants of this program.\r"

The authors of this proposal investigated STD education for medical students at the University of California at Los Angeles and propose a project to involve third-year medical students in STD prevention techniques during their STD-clinic rotation. The long-term goal is to decrease the incidence and prevalence of STD. The immediate aims are to increase medical students' knowledge of STD prevention and to help them develop the communication skills necessary to effectively counsel patients about STD. Interventions would consist of a series of lectures and workshops using audiovisual aids, small group discussions, and role playing, and would be conducted by health educators and guest lecturers. A quasi-experimental research design would be used in testing the effectiveness of the project in two experimental and two control groups involving a total of 80 third-year medical students. The first intervention would be a 1-week lecture series. Written tests would be given before and after the first intervention to measure the baseline of the students' knowledge of STD prevention methods. The second intervention would be a 1-week workshop series. Students' interviews with patients would be videotaped before and after the second intervention so that the interviewer's communication skills may be assessed and compared. Sets of interventions would be scheduled for the fall of 1990 and the spring of 1991. Six months after the completion of the project, a followup questionnaire would be given to evaluate the project's overall effectiveness.\r"

A domain of the neurofibromatosis gene product (NF1) that has sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Ras-GAP and to yeast IRA gene products also has a specific stimulatory activity toward p21ras GTPase. Arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid inactivate GAP, but no agents have been identified that stimulate GAP and thereby switch p21ras off. With the use of recombinant Ha-c-Ras and Ras-GAP, NF1, and GAP catalytic domains, it was found that prostaglandins PGF2 alpha and PGA2 stimulated Ras-GAP and that prostacyclin PGI2 inhibited Ras-GAP. The stimulatory effect of PGF2 alpha was saturable and structure-specific and competed with the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid also inhibited the catalytic activity of NF1, but prostaglandins were not stimulatory. These results suggest a mechanism for the allosteric control of Ras function through the modulation of arachidonate metabolism.\r"

Significant acceleration of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis occurred in animals receiving parenteral nutrition consisting of amino acids, dextrose, and lipid or standard enteral nutrition compared to control animals. This study represents the first report of stimulating tumor metastasis with specific parenteral nutrients and clearly indicates that both primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis can be altered by exogenous substrate administration.\r"

Recently, the microscopic Du test (micro Du) enhanced with polyethylene glycol (PEG Du) and flow cytometry (FC) have been advocated for this purpose. Three qualitative methods (micro Du, rosette test, and PEG Du) and two quantitative methods (acid elution and FC) for assessing FMH were evaluated with particular attention given to PEG Du and FC. In vitro studies comprised 10 series of dilutions of D+ cord cells in D- adult cells to yield D+ cell concentrations of 0.06, 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, and 2.0 percent. Additionally, 26 postpartum samples were tested. Of the qualitative techniques, the micro Du test was the least sensitive with 20 percent false-negative results occurring at 0.5 percent fetal cells. The PEG Du test was only slightly more sensitive and offered no clinical advantage. The rosette test was the most sensitive, consistently detecting fetal cells at concentrations of 0.25 percent or greater. FC and acid elution showed similar results, with good correlation obtained between measured and expected quantities of fetal cells (r = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively). One of 26 postpartum samples was positive by all screening techniques; acid elution and FC detected 0.3-percent concentrations of fetal cells and 0.17-percent concentrations of D+ cells, respectively. Although acid elution is a more commonly used method for quantitating FMH, FC offers an acceptable alternative that is capable of analyzing large numbers of cells with objectivity and reproducibility.\r"

The results also indicate that not only do students make significant numbers of errors, but so do practicing technologists.

On the basis of these findings, several alternatives are proposed to reduce errors.\r"

A comprehensive survey of transfusion use, including packed red cells (RBCs), fresh-frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets (PLTs), was conducted in 12 Central Virginia hospitals. The medical records of 2579 transfused patients showed that the principal diagnoses in 23 percent of patients involved diseases of the circulatory system and those in 16 percent involved neoplasms, as classified under the diagnosis-related groups. Sixty-six percent (n = 1691) of patients had some type of surgery, with surgical patients overall using 1.9 times as many units of blood (RBCs, FFP, and PLTs) as nonsurgical patients. Mean patient age was 61 years, and the male:female ratio was 48:52 percent. This descriptive analysis of regional blood utilization has facilitated planning for local blood needs, provided indicators for areas of largest blood use, and given this region and others baseline data for future comparison.\r"

There was also a marked decrease in erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and reticulocytopenia in the peripheral blood. An IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy was found in low concentration (approximately 1%) in her serum, and the cold agglutinins had a titer of 2560. However, the cold agglutinin titer of the supernatant after cryoglobulin precipitation was 40. Redissolving the cryoglobulin in the supernatant resulted in a cold agglutinin titer of 1280. Moreover, the addition of the patient's whole serum inhibited erythroid colony formation in culture. The inhibition was removed by cryoprecipitation of the cryoglobulin. The patient was given steroid therapy, to which she responded with reticulocytosis and an elevation of hematocrit. By 3 months, the cold agglutinin titer had fallen to 10. She remained well 4 years later. Whereas reports of cryoprecipitable cold agglutinins are rare, this case is unique because there have been no previous reports that these cold active proteins also have erythroid stem cell-suppressant properties.\r"

A family of receptors (including the beta-adrenergic receptors) and guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) have been purified and cloned. Structure-function studies are beginning to provide insight into how the various components of the transmembrane signaling apparatus interact to promote alterations in the activity of the effector systems. Much effort has been devoted to understanding how various pathophysiologic conditions, such as ischemia or congestive heart failure, and the therapeutic methods used to treat such conditions perturb or regulate receptor systems. It has become abundantly clear that such regulation does occur but is not restricted to simple alterations in receptor number, and may well involve covalent modification (phosphorylation) of receptors or alteration in the ability of receptors to interact with G proteins. In addition, regulation of the quantity or functionality of the various G proteins and the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase itself appear to occur. For example, recent evidence suggests that congestive heart failure in humans is associated with a decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as an increased quantity of the inhibitory G protein (Gi). These alterations may provide important insight into how to develop new therapeutic methods. Mechanisms generally responsible for transmembrane signaling, how the components are regulated by pathophysiologic conditions, and drugs used to treat disease states are discussed in detail.\r"

  ".W": "Much attention has been paid to the influence of the beta-adrenoceptor system on cardiac function in heart failure. Full agonists and partial agonists acting on cardiac beta 1 receptors have been widely investigated, as has the density of these receptors in the failing heart. However, other cardiac control mechanisms may play important roles in the normal heart as well as in heart failure. The Frank-Starling mechanism of enhanced cardiac contraction produced by mechanical stretching of the ventricular myofibrils is well known. When treating patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators and other drugs that influence preload, it is important to consider their overall effects in relation to the Starling curves. Atrial stretching also produces compensatory responses which are currently being intensively studied. Reflex release of atrial natriuretic factor after stimulation of atrial receptors has important physiologic effects in heart failure. The atria, but not the ventricles, are innervated by the vagus; the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulation is often overlooked. The initial increase in heart rate during exercise is primarily due to withdrawal of vagal influence. Besides acetylcholine, the parasympathetic transmitter, many other local hormones may affect cardiac function; these include prostaglandins, 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. Although the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is mediated primarily through beta 1 adrenoceptors, both beta 2 and alpha receptors are also found in the heart. Myocardial alpha 1 receptors, which mediate a positive inotropic effect, have been identified, and prejunctional alpha 2 receptors may mediate inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[6-14C]glucose was infused on both occasions. Breath was collected for determination of the specific activity of carbon dioxide, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production. Glucose turnover during hyperinsulinemia was approximately eightfold higher than during saline infusion. During the final 1.5 h of the hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp, oxidation measured isotopically remained slightly but consistently lower (P less than 0.05) than that measured by indirect calorimetry (13.8 +/- 1.1 vs 16.5 +/- 1.7 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively). In contrast, during the saline infusion, glucose oxidation measured isotopically did not differ from that measured by indirect calorimetry (8.3 +/- 0.6 vs 7.2 +/- 2.8 mumol.kg-1.min-1, respectively). We conclude that although net glucose oxidation measured isotopically was slightly lower than that measured by indirect calorimetry, both techniques provide similar estimates of glucose oxidation over a wide range of glucose disposal.\r"

Changes in tumor volume, body weight, urinary nitrogen, whole-body and tissue protein kinetics, and fatty acid composition were measured. The study revealed that Fish/MCT feeding inhibited tumor growth, which could be attributed to decreased tumor protein synthesis. Body weight and nitrogen were better maintained by Fish/MCT feeding. In addition, the effects of Fish/MCT on tumor growth were synergistic with TNF treatment. The results demonstrate that dietary fat composition can influence fatty acid compositions of tumor tissue as well as tumor protein kinetics after a short period of TPN feeding.\r"

To define the responsiveness to a soy-protein diet in this disease, one homozygous and twenty heterozygous type IIa patients were submitted to a 4-wk traditional hypocholesterolemic diet followed by 4 wk in which animal protein was substituted with texturized soy protein. Soy was then withdrawn for a further 4 wk. No significant changes in plasma lipids were observed during low-lipid diets. The soy diet, however, caused a marked decrease in total (-20.8%) and low-density-lipoprotein (-25.8%) cholesterol and in apolipoprotein B (-14.1%). The plasma cholesterol reduction was higher in patients with apolipoprotein E3/E3 or E3/E4 vs an almost negligible effect on E3/E2. These results confirm that soy-protein diets can lower cholesterol in type IIa patients with familial disease. Data on the sensitivity of patients with different apo-E isoforms agree with recent hypotheses suggesting that soy proteins may activate B,E receptors.\r"

Total fecal bile acid concentrations were significantly higher with the fiber-free diet than with 30 g WB, VF, and SBF (P less than 0.001) and were also higher with 30 g SBF than with 30 g WB and 30 g VF (P less than 0.005). Daily fecal bile acid excretion was not different on 30 g SBF compared with 30 g WB and 30 g VF. Differences in cholesterol reduction across the diets could not be explained by differences in fecal bile acid excretion.\r"

Patients were then fed intravenously amino acids and glucose or glucose alone or fed enterally for 5-6 d. Daily excretions of orotic acid, uric acid, urea, nitrogen, and creatinine were monitored. Mild orotic aciduria and uricosuria with hypouricemia were the basal-trauma responses. The significant (P = 0.001, r = 0.70) positive correlation between orotic and uric acid excretion demonstrates the parallelism between pyrimidine and purine metabolism. Feeding for 5-6 d could decrease but not readily abolish the injury-induced metabolic changes in nitrogen, pyrimidine, and purine metabolism. Glucose infusion alone may be sufficient to counteract the metabolic effects of trauma in the early flow phase of injury.\r"

Involution of the recirculating lymphocyte pool of the LP group was proportionately less than the lymphoid atrophy of the spleen and mesenteric nodes. The LP protocol exerted no influence on the ratio of helper (CD4+) to suppressor (CD8+) T cells and increased the ratio of T cells to B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs and recirculating pool. These results challenge two established concepts: that T-dependent immunodepression in PEM depends on a reduced CD4(+)-CD8+ ratio and that PEM induces greater involution within the T-cell system than within the B-cell system.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperventilation produces small decreases in blood pressure in normal subjects and larger decreases in patients with autonomic failure. The authors studied the mechanism for this observation by measuring mean arterial pressure (MAP) and arterial blood gas (ABG) changes in eight patients with severe primary autonomic failure after various maneuvers designed to alter PaCO2, PaO2, and pH. Maneuvers included voluntary hyperventilation, breathing a 5% CO2/95% O2 mixture, breathing 12% O2, breathing through a 1 meter tube to increase dead space, breathing 100% O2, and infusion of 120 mEq NaHCO3 over 30 minutes. All maneuvers led to expected changes in ABGs. Voluntary hyperventilation lowered MAP by 23 +/- 4 (p less than 0.01) mmHg but MAP was raised 11 +/- 3 and 7 +/- 1 mmHg by hyperventilation resulting from increasing breathing dead space or from breathing 5% CO2, respectively. Breathing 100% O2 or 12% O2 had no significant effect on MAP, and NaHCO3 infusion raised MAP by 8 +/- 4 (p less than 0.05) mmHg. With all maneuvers, change in MAP correlated with change in PaCO2 (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) and change in pH (r = -0.57, p less than 0.01) but not with PaO2. Multiple regression analysis showed that only changes in PaCO2 predicted the change in MAP for all maneuvers. The authors conclude that a decrease in PaCO2 causes the observed decreases in MAP with hyperventilation. This most likely represents a direct peripheral vasodilator effect of hypocarbia rather than a reflex or centrally-mediated mechanism since our patient population is characterized by inadequate or absent autonomic cardiovascular reflex responses.\r"

Furthermore, an inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in relation to the low plasma osmolality was observed at an early stage of hyponatremia. Hydrocortisone therapy effectively corrected his hyponatremia. Following the correction of hyponatremia, the value of free water clearance increased and the level of the plasma ADH decreased. Thus, the present case indicates that ACTH deficiency can cause the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH.\r"

Treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D was effective. A survey of the literature revealed that 34 similar cases have been reported in the past. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism remains to be determined, osteomalacia in neurofibromatosis appears to be distinct from more common dysplastic skeletal affections of this disease, being characterized by later onset in adulthood as a rule, renal phosphate loss with hypophosphatemia, multiple pseudofractures in typical cases, and response to treatment with pharmacological dose of vitamin D with or without phosphate supplement.\r"

The urinary sodium excretion was 204 +/- 38 (mean +/- SEM) muEq/min in normotensives and 233 +/- 28 muEq/min in hypertensives before infusion of saline and increased maximally to 499 +/- 114 muEq/min (P less than .05) and to 928 +/- 68 muEq/min (P less than .01), respectively, after saline infusion. In normotensives, urinary calcium excretion did not change significantly; however, in hypertensives excretion increased markedly (P less than .01) from 6.1 +/- 0.7 muEq/min to 12.3 +/- 1.6 muEq/min. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels increased significantly (P less than .05) in both groups. Serum ionized calcium and plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels did not change significantly. The increments of urinary sodium and calcium and of plasma ANP, as well as the preinfusion plasma PTH level, were significantly (P less than .05) higher in hypertensives than in normotensives. The present study showed that exaggerated natriuresis was accompanied by hypercalcinuria and an enhanced rise in plasma ANP in hypertensives. Basal levels of plasma PTH were elevated in hypertensives. The calcium deficiency may be attributable to a close relationship between urinary sodium and calcium, and causally related to the disturbance of sodium and volume homeostasis in hypertension, which results in exaggerated natriuresis.\r"

After saline infusion, both groups showed increases in urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). The increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary dopamine excretion (UDAV) and the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) were similar in both groups. However, no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was seen in either group. Since significant negative linear correlations between the basal level of PRA and percent change in UNaV or GFR were seen only in EHT, we observed the influence of suppressing the renin-angiotensin system with a converting enzyme inhibitor. After a 7 day treatment with enalapril, GFR and UNaV in EHT after saline infusion were comparable to data obtained in the absence of enalapril, despite a reduction in preexpansion BP. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the basal BP and the percent increase in UNaV was seen among EHT after enalapril treatment. These results suggest that the state of the renin-angiotensin system is important in renal sodium excretion in EHT.\r"

The results demonstrated that the hyperinsulinemic group had significantly higher values for both systolic (P less than .01) and diastolic (P less than .05) blood pressure. In addition, plasma concentrations of triglyceride (P less than .02), aldosterone (P less than .05) and potassium (P less than .05) were higher in hyperinsulinemic individuals as compared to those who were normoinsulinemic. Furthermore, red cell potassium was lower (P less than .01) and red cell sodium higher (P less than .01) in the hyperinsulinemic group. Finally, the magnitude of hyperinsulinemia correlated directly with systolic (r = 0.50, P less than .01) and diastolic (r = 0.44, P less than .05) blood pressure, concentration of plasma triglyceride (r = 0.55, P less than .01) and aldosterone (r = 0.46, p less than .05), and erythrocyte sodium concentration (r = 0.57, p less than .01). In contrast, plasma insulin response was negatively correlated with erythrocyte potassium concentration (r = 0.40, P less than 0.05). These observations provide further support for the view that hyperinsulinemia, presumably secondary to resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, is associated with a cluster of variables that may play important roles in the etiology and clinical course of hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "91214591\r", 
  ".W": "In the context of atherosclerosis, calcium antagonists should be evaluated from two points of view: their hemodynamic action on the atherosclerotic cardiovascular system, and their preventive action on atherosclerosis. Contraction of atherosclerotic vessels in response to vasoconstrictors, especially serotonin and acetylcholine, is enhanced mainly because of endothelial dysfunction. Due to their antivasoconstrictor effect, calcium antagonists partly compensate for this endothelial dysfunction. Agents which show a pronounced 'use-dependence', such as isradipine, are of particular interest as their action increases with the intensity of contraction. Therefore, their action is most prominent where it is most needed. Nevertheless, experiments in atherosclerotic animals indicate that the dose has to be chosen more cautiously than for young animals, as the dose-response curve for several effects is bell-shaped. Calcium antagonists also interfere with the process of atherosclerosis. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, lesion development is reduced, and regression after reverting to a normal diet is modestly enhanced. Calcium antagonists do not lower blood lipid levels. However, they attenuate proliferative lesions following endothelial damage due to a balloon catheter or electrical stimulation. The mechanism of these effects is still not clear. Blockade of the potential-sensitive L-type calcium channel is probably the important mechanism. Many types of cells (macrophages, other leukocytes and platelets, smooth muscle cells, connective tissue cells, endothelium, etc.) are involved in the genesis of atherosclerotic plaques, but it is not known which of these are the important targets of calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists are most effective when administered at the onset of atherosclerosis, as they probably inhibit events occurring during the initiation of the atherosclerotic process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dose-response curves reveal that isradipine is one of the most potent and efficacious representatives of this class of compounds, reducing the infarct size by more than 60%. These results suggest that isradipine, when administered shortly after stroke onset, may have beneficial effects in patients suffering from brain ischemia. When isradipine is used to normalize the high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats, it will, in addition, also protect the brain from damage engendered by a subsequent stroke. This is not the case if blood pressure is controlled with a calcium antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, suggesting that the brain protection seen with isradipine is not due to blood pressure normalization. Isradipine, when used as an antihypertensive, appears to have an additional beneficial effect within the brain itself. As high blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke, such an additional benefit with isradipine would be particularly valuable in antihypertensive therapy.\r"

Patients were switched from other antihypertensive drugs, mainly diuretics and beta-blockers. The dose of isradipine remained virtually unchanged throughout the study and resulted in a mean decrease of 22 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P less than .00001) and 19 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P less than .00001). Heart rate was unchanged (difference of -1 beats/min), as was the mean body weight of the study patients. Isradipine was generally well tolerated. Side effects were few and, when present, tended to diminish and eventually disappear during the treatment period.

Four of these patients withdrew from the study during the double-blind phase because of adverse events (one taking isradipine and three taking placebo). Blood pressure during the double-blind study was always measured 12 h after drug administration (trough values). The rate of normalization [defined as diastolic BP (DBP) less than or equal to 90 mm Hg] was 52/96 (54%) in the isradipine-treated group compared with 30/87 (33%) in the placebo group. A further 12/96 (12%) patients taking isradipine showed a fall in DBP of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, although their DBP was still not less than 90 mm Hg, compared with 5/87 (6%) patients receiving placebo.

Both the mean changes from baseline in diastolic and systolic blood pressures and the percentage of patients responding to treatment (blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg) were greater with isradipine than with placebo or active controls. Blood pressure response increases with increases in isradipine dose up to 10 to 15 mg daily; higher doses do not, on average, result in greater blood pressure reduction. The incidence of adverse reactions with isradipine is similar to that for active controls and slightly more than for placebo. There were fewer discontinuations with isradipine and, in addition, a decrease in the incidence of new adverse reactions with increasing duration of treatment, down to 1% at 24 months.\r"

  ".W": "After a placebo run-in phase of four weeks' duration, 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily orally was administered for one year to 23 patients who had been diagnosed as hypertensive. Good control of blood pressure was recorded in the majority of patients until the third month of treatment. After five months, it was necessary to add a beta-blocker to the treatment regimens of some of the patients in order to maintain the target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. Patients were exercise-tested using bicycle ergometry. After three months, diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower during exercise when comparing the treatment values with those taken at the end of the placebo run-in (baseline values). Values for systolic blood pressure did not differ between treatment and baseline. These results may be explained by the decrease in peripheral vascular resistance produced by isradipine. After one year, the results were modified by the administration of the beta-blocker bopindolol (Sandonorm, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basle, Switzerland). Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels did not change during treatment. Triglycerides were lower after three months, but slightly higher after one year, with an average value lying within the normal range. The influence of isradipine on plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels was followed by measuring values at rest and during exercise. It was found that PRA was higher during the first three months, then inversely inhibited to lower levels. Aldosterone levels were also increased after three months, but without a subsequent decrease. The results are compared with those obtained with diltiazem in a similar treatment regimen.\r"

The isradipine dose necessary to normalize BP (both at rest and post-exercise) was 1.25 mg twice daily (2 x 1/2 tablet) in 50% of patients and 2.5 mg twice daily (2 x 1 tablet) in 25%. In the remaining 25% of patients, isradipine was combined with 1 mg/day bopindolol. There were virtually no accompanying side effects; in particular, reflex tachycardia was negligible or absent.

Blood pressures (BP) were measured every 14 days, always by the same observer and using standard techniques. The Montevideo Mathematical Model was used to determine the time course of the response to treatment in each dosage group. Of the 33 patients who completed the study, four of the 12 patients receiving 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily had their BP controlled by weeks 10 or 12 (supine DBP less than or equal to 90 mm Hg), seven of 11 by 2.5 mg twice daily, and five of 10 by 5 mg twice daily. Mean DBPs for each dosage group were significantly reduced by week 12 (P less than .015 in all groups). The Montevideo Model allows estimation of the time after onset of treatment by which BP is reduced by a given amount. This model indicated that, with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily, a fall in mean arterial pressure of 10 mm Hg is to be expected within three weeks of initiating drug administration.\r"

Initial treatment started with 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. If normotension was not achieved after four weeks, doses were increased to 2.5 mg twice daily or 25 mg twice daily, respectively. If the maximum dose as monotherapy did not result in normotension, captopril (12.5 mg or, if necessary, 25 mg twice daily) was added to regimens of the isradipine-treated patients or isradipine (1.25 mg or, if necessary, 2.5 mg twice daily) was given in addition to the captopril-treated patients. After 24 weeks of active treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P less than .001) with isradipine (from 168 +/- 18 to 144 +/- 14 mm Hg) and with captopril (from 168 +/- 20 to 143 +/- 10 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure also fell significantly (P less than .001) in both groups (isradipine: from 105 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 5 mm Hg; captopril; from 105 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg). With isradipine as monotherapy, diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 49% of patients compared with 56% with captopril as monotherapy (P = NS). Combining both drugs resulted in an increased rate of normalization (to 87%). The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated during long-term therapy.\r"

Overall, isradipine resulted in a higher responder rate, particularly among patients who had higher entry BPs. Fifteen enalapril-treated patients and four isradipine-treated patients discontinued treatment (four taking enalapril and none taking isradipine withdrew because of lack of efficacy). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, and edema in the isradipine group, and cough, headache, and chest pain in the enalapril group. Both drugs produced significant reductions in BP, but, in this study isradipine was more effective. The drugs were similarly well tolerated.\r"

Mean 24-h blood pressure decreased significantly after both periods 2 and 3 (from 148/93 mm Hg to 137/87 and 130/85 mm Hg, respectively). The total number of hypertensive systolic and diastolic blood pressure values also decreased. The normal circadian blood pressure curve was preserved, showing the reduction throughout the 24-h period, and the early morning rise in blood pressure was markedly blunted. These results indicate that isradipine has a favorable effect on the 24-h blood pressure profile that persisted throughout six and 12 months of antihypertensive therapy.\r"

Tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity was significantly decreased in hypertensives compared to controls (P less than .05). During therapy, platelet aggregation decreased and t-PA activity increased (P less than .05).

Both the serotonin-induced and the LDL plus serotonin-induced platelet aggregation were significantly decreased after four weeks of isradipine treatment compared with placebo. The amplifying effect of LDL on the serotonin-induced aggregation was significant both after placebo and after active treatment with isradipine. A further decrease in platelet aggregation induced by LDL plus serotonin was observed after 12 weeks of isradipine treatment so that no amplification of serotonin-induced aggregation by LDL could be detected. In conclusion, it appears that treatment with isradipine restores the impaired platelet response to serotonin and LDL in hypertensive patients.

The four calcium antagonists included in this study were all found to significantly (P less than or equal to .05) diminish the force of contraction above 0.01 mumol/L, but with different potencies. On the basis of the relationship between therapeutic vasoactive plasma concentrations and the negative inotropic effective concentrations in our system in vitro, the ranking order of potential negative inotropism in the treatment of cardiac failure with calcium antagonists was verapamil greater than nifedipine greater than diltiazem greater than isradipine. Thus, to minimize cardiodepressant risk, the use of calcium antagonists with weak negative inotropic effects at relevant concentrations should be preferred, especially in the case of patients with compromised cardiac function.\r"

Assessments included vital signs, resting blood flow in the calf and finger (using an electrocardiograph-triggered venous occlusion plethysmograph), reflex responses during isometric exercise and cold pressor resistance, and venous capacitance in the forearm and calf. Isradipine lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension without reflex tachycardia or venoconstriction. All of the reflex responses studied were attenuated. It is concluded that vasodilatation of the peripheral circulation induced by isradipine contributes partially to the blood pressure-lowering effect.\r"

The mean dosage in the isradipine group was 7.9 +/- 3.5 mg/day, and 69.2 +/- 43.5 mg/day in the atenolol group. A significant reduction of the arterial blood pressure was seen with both treatment regimens. Lung volumes and airways resistance remained unchanged, but, in the atenolol-treated group, the linear relationship between alveolar pressure and airways resistance at the lower lung volumes during forced expiration at 25% of forced vital capacity was affected by a shift to higher airways resistance. This change can be interpreted as an early sign of altered air-flow behavior in the small airways in subjects susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The calcium antagonist isradipine did not produce changes in any parameters of lung function in this group of patients.\r"

Isradipine, given as a continuous infusion, reduced MAP to the range of 85 +/- 5 mm Hg in all patients within 15 min. Systemic vascular resistance fell and cardiac output increased in all patients. A slight increase in heart rate was seen in some, but not all, patients. There were no adverse effects.

  ".U": "91214622\r", 
  ".W": "Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of selectivity for the coronary, cerebral, and skeletal muscle vasculature. The drug has minimal depressant activity on sinoatrial node automaticity and negligible negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic actions. Isradipine reduces blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without changes in cardiac output and stroke volume. Renal blood flow is maintained while renal vascular resistance is reduced; this is accompanied by both short- and long-term diuretic and natriuretic effects. Doses of 1.25 to 5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure effectively over 24 h. In open as well as placebo-controlled trials, 2.5 to 10 mg isradipine twice daily was safe and well tolerated, and reduced systolic and diastolic values in up to 85% of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Efficacy is similar to those of nifedipine and nitrendipine, and potentially superior to those of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin, hydrochlorothiazide, and diltiazem. The drug can be safely combined with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and secondary to arterial vasodilatation, such as headache, flushing, ankle edema, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia. At the recommended dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, the total incidence of side effects does not differ from that with placebo. The antiatherosclerotic, antitrophic, and cerebroprotective effects seen in experimental animal models are promising for the drug in the treatment of human hypertension. Isradipine may not only reduce blood pressure, but may also reduce the risk for the consequences of this peril, namely, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction.\r"

Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%. Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%). Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%). Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients. The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described.\r"

In the comparison group, GGT increased with advancing gestation (r = 0.7; P = 0.002), whereas ALP, AST and ALT did not correlate with gestational age. Rh hydropic fetuses (n = 8) had higher blood ALT levels than the comparison fetuses (P = 0.008) had significantly increased transaminases when compared with non hydropic fetuses (n = 17). In hydropic fetuses, AST correlated with the nucleated red cell count before transfusion (r = 0.94; P = less than 0.0001). Fetal transaminases were no longer increased in hydropic fetuses by the second (AST) or third (ALT) transfusion. In both hydropic and non hydropic fetuses, GGT increased by the second transfusion (median percentage change +85%, range -83% to +596%; P = 0.003). The rise in fetal GGT was transitory and correlated with the increase in fetal haematocrit at the first transfusion (r = 0.58; P = 0.006).

SETTING--Six doctor practice in south London looking after 11,500 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Ability of receptionist to present data showing the level of attainment of the practice's goals; time spent on audit by receptionist each week. RESULTS--The practice set goals for immunisation; follow up of patients with abnormal cervical smears; frequency of recording of blood pressure and smoking habit; screening of patients over 75; care of diabetic patients and patients with serious mental illness; antenatal care; variations in workload; and availability of appointments. The receptionist was able to audit all these tasks in four hours a week; this increased her job satisfaction and extended her skills. A small amount of regular supervision was necessary--roughly 30 minutes a week in the first year of the study and 30 minutes a fortnight in the second--to ensure accuracy and deal with any difficulties that arose. CONCLUSION--The method developed enabled a receptionist to audit aspects of the practice cost effectively. There is great scope for enlarging the conventional role of the receptionist.\r"

RESULTS--Before the unit was established the mean admission time was one and a half (range half to three) days for women who required no treatment and three (one and a half to five) days in women requiring evacuation of uterus. These times were reduced to two hours as an outpatient and one day respectively for most women after the unit was established. Between 318 and 505 women were estimated to have been saved from unnecessary admission, and 233 had their stay reduced; the associated saving was between pounds 95,000 and pounds 120,000 in one year.

Positive test results were confirmed or refuted by high resolution computed tomography with intravenous enhancement. SETTING--Single general otolaryngology clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--270 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss requiring investigation to exclude a lesion of the cerebellopontine angle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Estimated costs of various diagnostic protocols and performance in detecting tumours of the cerebellopontine angle. RESULTS--Protocols including tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds as sifting tests before computed tomography were clinically acceptable and presented considerable savings over the use of computed tomography in all patients (74,000 pounds or 84,000 pounds v 122,000 pounds). The use of electronystagmography and calorics could not be justified on clinical or financial grounds. CONCLUSIONS--Audiological tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds followed by computed tomography constitute the most cost effective protocol for determining suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle.

  ".W": "This was a Phase II study of 24 late (FIGO) Stage IIb and 39 Stage III patients. External beam radiotherapy was given daily, five days a week, using 15 x 15 cm parallel opposed pelvic fields. The first 20 patients had 45.00 Gy mid-plane dose in 20 fractions, Days 1-28, the last 43 patients had 50.40 Gy in 28 fractions, Days 1-43. This was followed by an intracavitary boost of 17.00 Gy to Point A in two fractions over seven days. The first seven patients had concomitant 5-fluorouracil (5FU) 1 g/m2/day (maximum 1.5 g/day) Days 2-5, 30-33 and 57-60, with mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 (maximum 15 mg) Days 2 and 57. Two patients had WHO Grade 4 cytopenia, and only two were able to have full dose intensity. The 5FU dose was reduced to 0.8 g/m2/day, for Days 2-5 and 30-33; mitomycin C was given on Day 2 only. Treatment morbidity with the reduced chemotherapy intensity was comparable with that of radiotherapy alone. Median follow-up was 16 months (range 6-44). Median survival was 35 months. The results were compared with historical controls treated using the same radiation method alone. Two-year survival for late Stage IIb patients was 67% with the combination and 72% with radiotherapy alone; for Stage III, 67% and 49% respectively. Two-year pelvic control for late Stage IIb was 87% (combination) and 84% (radiotherapy alone) and for Stage III, 61% and 55% respectively. In contrast to reports from other centres, these results do not show an overall significant improvement on radiotherapy alone. A Phase III study may not be practicable.\r"

Urinary calcium excretion was considerably reduced, but there was some increase in urinary phosphate and oxalate. Urinary excretion of magnesium and uric acid, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, uric acid, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and ALP was unaffected. There were no obvious changes in serum iron, zinc and copper even when patients were treated for long periods. Rice bran was well tolerated in almost all cases and there were no serious side effects; 49 patients have undergone treatment for more than 3 years (average duration of administration 5.09 years). The frequency of new stone formation was drastically reduced (individual stone formation rate (no./year) from 0.720 +/- 0.533 to 0.125 +/- 0.204; group stone formation rate (no./patient-year) from 0.721 to 0.120) compared with the 3-year period before treatment. During treatment, 61.2% of patients remained in remission. Although rice bran therapy should be effective in correcting absorptive hypercalciuria, there may be limits to the overall ability of rice bran monotherapy to prevent recurrence.\r"

Wet and dry liver weights and nitrogen content were significantly increased by TNF (P less than 0.001), indicating an increase in liver mass. A further 81 rats were infused with TNF (2 or 4 x 10(5) units kg-1 24 h-1) or saline over 1, 3 and 6 days. Total liver DNA and protein content and counts of hepatocyte mitosis were determined. Liver DNA and protein increased with dose of TNF and time (P less than 0.001), suggesting that TNF increased hepatic cellularity. Histological examination demonstrated no significant inflammatory infiltrate to account for the increased cell mass. However, the number of hepatocyte mitoses increased with dose of TNF and time (P less than 0.05), indicating that the increase in liver cellularity was due to increased hepatocyte cell number. TNF-induced hepatic hyperplasia appears to be an additional feature of the integrated host response to injury and infection.\r"

Fourteen infants were anaesthetized and their lungs ventilated using a Drager ventilator and a paediatric circle system. Blood gas determination of PaCO2 was obtained from an arterial catheter and compared with continuous sampling of ETCO2 analyzed by raman spectroscopy. The PaCO2 (35.3 +/- 4.9 mmHg, x +/- SD) was not different from the ETCO2 sampled within the proximal endotracheal tube (34.7 +/- 3.8 mmHg), but was greater (P less than 0.05) than the ETCO2 at the proximal connector (31.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg).

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study addressed the need for heparin administration to be continued for more than 24 hours after coronary thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). METHODS AND RESULTS. A total of 241 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with 100 mg rt-PA and a bolus of 5,000 units i.v. heparin followed by 1,000 units/hr i.v. heparin for 24 hours. At 24 hours, 202 patients were randomized to continue intravenous heparin therapy (n = 99) in full dosage or to discontinue heparin therapy and begin an oral antiplatelet regimen of aspirin (300 mg/day) and dipyridamole (300 mg/day) (n = 103). On prospective recording, there were no differences in the pattern of chest pain, reinfarction, or bleeding complications. Coronary angiography on cardiac catheterization at 7-10 days showed no differences in patency of the infarct-related artery. The proportion of patients with total occlusion (TIMI grade 0-1) of the infarct-related artery was 18.9% in the heparin group and 19.8% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. In the patients with an incompletely occluded infarct-related artery, the lumen was reduced by 69 +/- 2% of normal in the heparin group and 67 +/- 2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. Left ventricular function assessed on cardiac catheterization and radionuclide study at day 2 and at 1 month showed no differences between the two groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction on radionuclide ventriculography at 1 month was 52.4 +/- 1.2% in the heparin group and 51.9 +/- 1.2% in the aspirin and dipyridamole group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that heparin therapy can be discontinued 24 hours after rt-PA therapy and replaced with an oral antiplatelet regimen without any adverse effects on chest pain, reinfarction, coronary patency, or left ventricular function.\r"

  ".W": "Recent trials of myocardial reperfusion using single-agent thrombolytic therapy and sequential cardiac catheterization have supported a conservative approach to the patient with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate combination thrombolytic therapy and the role of a previously untested strategy for the aggressive use of cardiac catheterization, we performed a multicenter clinical trial with a 3 x 2 factorial design in which 575 patients were randomly allocated to one of three drug regimens--tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (n = 191), urokinase (n = 190), or both (n = 194) - and one of two catheterization strategies--immediate catheterization with angioplasty for failed thrombolysis (n = 287) or deferred predischarge catheterization on days 5-10 (n = 288). Patients with contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, cardiogenic shock, or age of more than 75 years were excluded. Global left ventricular ejection fraction was well preserved and almost identical at predischarge catheterization (54%), regardless of the catheterization or thrombolytic strategy used (p = 0.98). Combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with a less complicated clinical course, most clearly documented by a lower rate of reocclusion (2%) compared with urokinase (7%) and t-PA (12%) (p = 0.04) and a lower rate of recurrent ischemia (25%) compared with urokinase (35%) and t-PA (31%). When a composite clinical end point (e.g., death, stroke, reinfarction, reocclusion, heart failure, or recurrent ischemia) was examined, combination thrombolytic therapy was associated with greater freedom from any adverse event (68%) compared with either single agent (urokinase, 55%; t-PA, 60%) (p = 0.04) and with a less complicated clinical course when the composite clinical end points were ranked according to clinical severity (p = 0.024). Early patency rates were greater with combination therapy, although predischarge patency rates after considering interventions to maintain patency were similar among drug regimens. No difference in bleeding complication rates was observed with any thrombolytic regimen. The aggressive catheterization strategy led to an overall early patency rate of 96% and a predischarge patency rate of 94% compared with a 90% predischarge patency in the conservative strategy (p = 0.065). The aggressive strategy improved regional wall motion in the infarct region (-2.16 SDs/chord) compared with deferred catheterization (-2.49 SDs/chord) (p = 0.004). More patients treated with the aggressive strategy were free from adverse outcomes (67% versus 55% in the conservative strategy, p = 0.004), and the clinical course was less complicated when the adverse outcomes were ranked according to severity (p = 0.016). No significant increase in use of blood products resulted from the aggressive strategy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

METHODS AND RESULTS. Tissue plasminogen activator activity in plasma was comparable among patients with unstable angina (n = 17), patients with stable exertional angina (n = 10), and control patients with normal coronary arteriograms (n = 8). In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity in plasma was elevated in the unstable angina group (21.67 +/- 9.52 AU/ml) as compared with either the stable angina group (12.01 +/- 7.06 AU/ml, p less than 0.02) or the controls (12.49 +/- 8.54 AU/ml, p less than 0.02). Coronary angiography performed within 24 hours after the last anginal episode showed a similar extent of coronary artery disease in the unstable and stable angina groups. However, intracoronary thrombi were observed in eight patients in the unstable angina group while no thrombus was noted in the stable angina group (chi 2 = 7.22, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that patients with unstable angina at rest have a reduced fibrinolytic activity and an increased incidence of intracoronary thrombi. It is postulated that elevated PAI-1 activity in the presence of coronary arterial wall injury may be an important factor leading to the development of acute coronary syndromes.\r"

The effects of 6 months of intensive endurance exercise training on resting tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, t-PA antigen, and fibrinogen were studied in 10 young (24-30 years) and in 13 old male subjects (60-82 years). METHODS AND RESULTS. After training, maximum oxygen consumption was increased in the young group by 18% (44.9 +/- 5.0 to 52.9 +/- 6.6 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.001), whereas it was increased in the old group by 22% (29.0 +/- 4.2 to 35.5 +/- 3.6 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.001). The young group had no significant changes in any of the measured variables, whereas the old group had a 39% increase in t-PA activity (0.82 +/- 0.47 to 1.14 +/- 0.42 IU/ml, p less than 0.03), a 141% increase in the percentage of t-PA in the active form (11.1 +/- 7.7 to 26.8 +/- 15.1%, p less than 0.01), a 58% decrease in PAI-1 activity (8.4 +/- 4.9 to 3.5 +/- 1.7 AU/ml, p less than 0.01), and a 13% decrease in fibrinogen (3.57 +/- 0.79 to 3.11 +/- 0.52 g/l, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that intensive exercise training enhances resting t-PA activity and reduces fibrinogen and PAI-1 activity in older men. These effects are potential mechanisms by which habitual physical activity might reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. This study evaluated the role of changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, volume, and cardiac tissue atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration in the modulation of plasma ANF concentration in a model of pacing-induced heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS. The effects of acute right ventricular pacing (250 beats/min), acute volume expansion (35 ml/min), and volume expansion after 1 week of right ventricular pacing on plasma ANF concentration were compared in eight dogs (group 1). As shown during right ventricular pacing previously, volume expansion produced significant increases in cardiac filling pressures and left atrial volume. Right ventricular pacing and volume expansion produced similar increments in plasma ANF concentration: from 32 +/- 12 to 168 +/- 153 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and from 32 +/- 9 to 137 +/- 113 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), respectively. When pacing was initiated after volume expansion, plasma ANF concentration increased further to 462 +/- 295 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) despite little change in filling pressures and left atrial volume. With repeated volume expansion after 1 week of pacing, there were no significant further increases in left atrial volume and plasma ANF concentrations (from 332 +/- 121 to 407 +/- 113 pg/ml) despite significant increases in filling pressures. Atrial and ventricular tissue samples were also obtained from 21 dogs paced to severe heart failure (group 2) and from 14 normal dogs (controls). In all groups, atrial ANF was higher than ventricular ANF concentration. At 1 week (group 1), left atrial appendage ANF concentration (6.2 +/- 2.5 versus 16.1 +/- 10.3 ng/mg) was reduced, whereas left ventricular free wall ANF concentration (0.62 +/- 0.31 versus 0.24 +/- 0.16 pg/mg) was increased compared with that of controls (both p less than 0.001). At severe heart failure (group 2), atrial ANF remained low, whereas ventricular ANF concentration was similar to that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that in pacing-induced heart failure, changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, and volume all contribute to the increased plasma ANF concentration. However, by 1 week (early heart failure), ANF release is attenuated, perhaps because of the inability of the atria to be stretched further and because of reduced atrial ANF concentration. In addition, the ventricle may be an additional source of ANF.\r"

Inhibitors of this enzyme have been reported to prolong the half-life of atrial natriuretic factor in vivo and to potentiate the renal and haemodynamic effects of exogenous atrial natriuretic factor. 2. (+/-)-Candoxatrilat, a selective neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, potentiated the natriuretic and diuretic response to volume loading in anaesthetized rats. Part of the response to volume loading and the potentiation by (+/-)-candoxatrilat was prevented by a polyclonal atrial natriuretic factor antiserum. The diuretic and natriuretic responses evoked by hydrochlorothiazide were not altered by the antiserum. 3. (+/-)-Candoxatrilat reduced systolic blood pressure of one-kidney deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats for over 5 h. This response was abolished by pretreatment with atrial natriuretic factor antiserum. 4. These data demonstrate that the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (+/-)-candoxatrilat has natriuretic/diuretic and antihypertensive effects in rodents, and that these effects are mediated via endogenous atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

  ".W": "In enriched canine parietal cell preparations, misoprostol, an analog of prostaglandin E1 methyl ester, was rapidly deesterified to misoprostol free acid. Under this circumstance, misoprostol and misoprostol free acid exhibited equal antisecretory potency against histamine-stimulated acid secretion and bound equally well to prostaglandin E receptors. When the deesterification of misoprostol was inhibited by paraoxon, an esterase inhibitor, the antisecretory and receptor binding activity of misoprostol was markedly reduced, with potency much less than misoprostol free acid. These results indicate that misoprostol free acid is the active biological form of misoprostol that binds to prostaglandin E receptors and mediates the antisecretory action of misoprostol.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by \"leaky\" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hirsutism score, plasma testosterone, and lipids. RESULTS: Initial hirsutism scores (11.8 +/- 0.6 SE) declined with treatment (-7.2 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) to 4.7 +/- 0.6, almost reaching control (3.6 +/- 0.3).

SETTING: Tertiary institutional outpatient care. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Six eugonadal women with minimal endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS: Oral administration of danazol, 200 mg three times daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gonadotropin mean levels, pulse frequency, and amplitude. RESULTS: The mean level of E2 was the same in the control cycle as that during danazol treatment (170 pmol/L). Danazol administration resulted in a 16% increase in the mean luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse amplitude (95% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 26%, P less than 0.01), associated with a 20% decrease in LH pulse frequency (95% CI -71% to +31%, P = 0.37). There was a nonsignificant increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pulse amplitude (2%, 95% CI -9% to +14%, P = 0.68) and in FSH pulse frequency (27%, 95% CI -4% to +58%, P = 0.08).

SETTING: Hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology. PATIENTS: Twenty-five women, ages 36 to 54 years with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata, were divided into two groups according to the responsiveness to LH-RH-a: group A patients reached menopause after LH-RH-a, whereas resumption of menstruation occurred within 12 weeks after cessation of therapy in group B. INTERVENTIONS: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist was administered intranasally three times a day with 150 micrograms insufflation of one spray in each nostril (total dose: 900 micrograms/d). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacies of treatment were assessed in terms of uterine volume, hemoglobin concentrations, serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and bone density during and after treatment. RESULTS: In both groups, hemoglobin concentrations increased significantly after 16 weeks of treatment. A significant reduction in uterine volume was observed in both groups. After completing therapy, there was no further significant change in uterine volume in group A, whereas uterine volume in group B returned to pretreatment values. Serum LH and FSH concentrations were suppressed during treatment, but those gonadotropins in group A increased significantly up to the menopausal levels after treatment. Serum E2 concentrations in both groups showed consistent suppression by the end of the first treatment cycle. After cessation of therapy, serum E2 levels on group A remained in the castrate range, whereas E2 in group B returned to pretreatment levels, concomitant with the return of normal ovulation. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal administration of LH-RH-a was successful in significantly decreasing uterine volume and increasing hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women with leiomyomata.\r"

PATIENTS: Twelve patients were selected for their poor ovarian response to previous stimulations using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRH-a) and human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG). INTERVENTIONS: Five hundred micrograms of GH-RH1-29 were administered two times daily concomitantly with GnRH-a and hMG from day 2 of the cycle to the time of ovulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stimulation of somatotroph axis was appreciated by measuring over-night urinary growth hormone (GH) output, plasma GH, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and follicular fluid (FF) IGF-I. The effects of GH-RH administration on ovarian function were determined by plasma estradiol levels and follicular data. RESULTS: Administration of GH-RH was associated with a significant improvement of urinary (P less than 0.025) and plasma (P less than 0.001) GH concentrations and of the hormonal response to hMG (P less than 0.01). Levels of IGF-I followed a biphasic plasma variation, and a slight increase in recruited follicles, retrieved oocytes, and FF IGF-I content was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the somatotroph axis by GH-RH enhances the hormonal ovarian response to hMG and may be an adjunctive therapy to improve follicular maturation.\r"

Ovarian stimulation was performed by clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) or by hMG combined with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) pretreatment. RESULTS: Oocyte maturity was correlated with an increasing FF progestin content and a significant decrease of androstenedione (A) levels. Chromosomal analysis revealed 84 of all oocytes to be abnormal (polyploid or aneuploid and/or prematurely condensed chromosomes present). In this group, A levels and A to estradiol ratios were significantly higher. Although progestin levels were higher in GnRH-a/hMG cycles, the incidence of oocyte normality was not different between the two stimulation schemes. More abnormal oocytes were found in patients with good sperm morphology. CONCLUSIONS: Oocyte abnormality correlates with higher A levels in the corresponding FF. Oocyte fertilization is also determined by intrinsic oocytic factors other than maturity.\r"

RESULTS: Ovulation induction with FSH was successful in achieving follicular development despite low circulating E2. Fertilization and cleavage rates were similar to the control subjects. The patient developed ovarian hyperstimulation. The lack of 17,20-desmolase activity was detected by normal P levels in serum and FF, high 17-OHP, and low T, A, and E2 levels in serum and FF. Granulosaluteal cell cultures in the presence of T restored normal E2 and P production in response to gonadotropins. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 17,20-desmolase deficiency, follicular development, oocyte maturation, and fertilization can take place in a low estrogenic environment.\r"

It has been suggested that the high level of aldose reductase activity may cause functional and structural abnormalities in diabetes and may be involved in the development of late complications.

The glomerular filtration rate (clearance of [125I]iothalamate) was significantly reduced from 140 +/- 18 to 129 +/- 10 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2, 2P = 0.02) in the ponalrestat-treated patients, whereas no change was seen after placebo (142 +/- 12 vs. 141 +/- 12 ml.min-1.1.73 m-2). The renal plasma flow (clearance of 131I-labeled hippuran), urinary albumin excretion rate (radioimmunoassay), fractional albumin clearance, and renal vascular resistance were unchanged in both groups. HbA1c showed a modest increase during ponalrestat (7.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 8.7 +/- 1.5%, 2P = 0.01) but was unchanged during placebo. No side effects of ponalrestat were observed. Thus, inhibition of aldose reductase may reduce the characteristic hyperfiltration in uncomplicated IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "A myo-inositol-related defect in nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in experimental diabetes has been invoked in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy, but the mechanism linking altered myo-inositol metabolism and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase regulation in diabetic nerve is uncertain. Decreased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in diabetic rat nerve is normalized by aldose reductase inhibitors or dietary myo-inositol, which preserve normal nerve myo-inositol content in vivo. Decreased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in diabetic rabbit nerve is acutely reversed by exposure to protein kinase C agonists in vitro. This study explored the relationship between the myo-inositol-sensitive and protein kinase C-agonist-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase defects in diabetic rat nerve. Ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity was measured in an enriched membrane fraction isolated from nondiabetic, streptozocin-induced diabetic, and myo-inositol-supplemented streptozocin-induced diabetic rats before and after the membranes were exposed to protein kinase C agonists in vitro. The decreased ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity in plasma membranes from untreated diabetic rats was increased after exposure to two structurally unrelated protein kinase C agonists; the normal ouabain-sensitive ATPase in plasma membranes from myo-inositol-supplemented diabetic rats was unaffected by protein kinase C agonists. The nonadditivity and implied equivalence of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase defect corrected by myo-inositol in vivo and by protein kinase C agonists in vitro are consistent with the postulated existence of a deficient myo-inositol-dependent phospholipid-derived protein kinase C agonist (presumably diacylglycerol) in diabetic nerve that regulates nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase either directly or via a protein kinase C mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies indicate that experimental diabetic autonomic neuropathy can be largely prevented by initiating therapy at the onset of diabetes. More clinically relevant, however, is the ability of therapy to reverse established neuropathy produced by long-standing diabetes. We have examined the effect of selected therapies on established neuroaxonal dystrophy (NAD) in ileal mesenteric nerves, a rat model of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Groups of 3-mo-old rats were made diabetic with streptozocin (STZ-D) and allowed to survive untreated for 5 mo, at which time they were begun on sorbinil, dietary myo-inositol, and daily insulin therapies or left untreated for an additional 2 or 4 mo. Ultrastructural evidence of NAD was demonstrated in ileal mesenteric nerves of rats with untreated 5-mo STZ-D and increased with the duration of diabetes. No lesions were demonstrated in control rats of any age. myo-Inositol or sorbinil administration failed to alter the severity of diabetes as measured by its metabolic indices. Institution of sorbinil or insulin treatment at 5 mo of diabetes prevented the increase in, but did not normalize, NAD at 7 or 9 mo. Dietary myo-inositol failed to significantly reverse established NAD or prevent its initial development. Morphometric examination of ileal mesenteric nerves demonstrated a decrease in the number of axons comprising each diabetic Schwann cell unit, suggestive of chronic cycles of axonal degeneration and regeneration. This parameter, clearly abnormal by 5 mo of diabetes, was not normalized by 2 or 4 mo of insulin, sorbinil, or myo-inositol treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Proteins were biosynthetically labeled in vitro for 10 min with [3H]leucine. Rapidly degraded proteins were eliminated during a 3-h preliminary degradation without insulin or added Zn2+ (2 mM nonradioactive leucine). Insulin (5 nM), the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (30 microM), and the biguanide antihyperglycemic agent phenformin (2 microns) each caused a sustained 35-40% inhibition of [3H]leucine release beginning within 1-2 min and reaching a maximum at 1-1.5 h. When these agents were combined, their simultaneous proteolytic inhibitory effects were not appreciably greater than the effect of chloroquine alone. Infusion of supraphysiological perfusate Zn2+ (greater than 15 microM) mimicked the inhibitory effect of insulin and chloroquine on lysosomal proteolysis. Infusion of supraphysiological Co2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Cr3+ (30 microM, 0.5 h) caused no change in proteolysis; however, 30 microM Cu2+ caused a slight inhibition. Presumptive chelation of the background (approximately 20 nM) Zn2+ by infusion of 3 microM CaNa2 EDTA caused no change in protein degradation over 1-2 h. The infusion of a physiological concentration of 1 or 5 microM Zn2+ (as ZnCl2) caused no change in protein degradation over 1-2 h. Biguanides are known to reversibly form a Zn2+ complex with affinity less than that of Zn2+ for EDTA. Prior infusion of 3 microM CaNa2 EDTA inactivated the proteolytic inhibitory effect of maximal (2 microM) phenformin over at least 1.25 h of concurrent infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We investigated this by immunofluorescent double labeling of islet cells with anti-MHC and anti-CD45 to identify cells of hematopoietic origin. MHC class I expression increased with age on CD45- islet cells. MHC class II expression was not observed on CD45- islet cells at any age; the only cells in the islet that were MHC class II positive were also CD45+. This indicates that all MHC class II-positive cells in the islet are lymphoid cells that infiltrate the islet, whereas the islet endocrine cells express no MHC class II molecules. However, an increase in MHC class I expression occurred on beta-cells, and this may play a role in immunopathogenesis.\r"

Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats).

SCH 39370 alone (2.5 mg/kg bolus) increased plasma atrial natriuretic factor and plasma cyclic GMP levels, lowered arterial pressure for periods beyond changes in plasma atrial natriuretic factor or cyclic GMP, and suppressed both plasma aldosterone and cortisol levels when compared with vehicle injections. The effects of SCH 39370 were similar to or exceeded those of atrial natriuretic factor infusions, which induced significantly greater increases in plasma atrial natriuretic factor (p = 0.01). Neither agent alone was natriuretic. When SCH 39370 and atrial natriuretic factor were given together, plasma cyclic GMP but not atrial natriuretic factor levels were increased (p = 0.013) compared with atrial natriuretic factor infusion alone, and the half-life was prolonged (p = 0.002) in the presence of SCH 39370. The hypotensive response was greater than that induced by atrial natriuretic factor alone (p = 0.03) but not different from SCH 39370 alone.

  ".W": "Rats with established monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension also exhibit a profound increase in lung resistance (RL) and a decrease in lung compliance. Because airway/lung dysfunction could precede and influence the evolution of MCT-induced pulmonary vascular disease, it is important to establish the temporal relationship between development of pulmonary hypertension and altered ventilatory function in MCT-treated rats. To resolve this issue, we segregated 47 young Sprague-Dawley rats into four groups: control (n = 13), MCT1 (n = 9), MCT2 (n = 11), and MCT3 (n = 14). Each MCT rat received a single subcutaneous injection of MCT (60 mg/kg) 1 MCT1), 2 (MCT2), or 3 (MCT3) wk before the functional study. At 1 wk after MCT, significant increases in RL and alveolar wall thickness were observed, as was a significant decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). Medial thickness of pulmonary arteries (50-100 microns OD) and right ventricular hypertrophy were not observed until 2 and 3 wk post-MCT, respectively. Coincident with the right ventricular hypertrophy at 3 wk post-MCT were decreased DLCO and increased alveolar wall thickness and lung dry weight. Pressure-volume curves of air-filled and saline-filled lungs showed marked rightward shifts during the 1st and 2nd wk after MCT administration and then decreased at the 3rd wk. These data suggest that MCT-induced alterations in airway/lung function preceded those of pulmonary vasculature and, therefore, implicate airway/lung dysfunctions as potentially contributing to the later development of pulmonary vascular abnormalities.\r"

The data were analyzed by fitting a linear equation, V = S(PETCO2-B), where V is minute ventilation S is the response curve slope. PETCO2 is end-tidal PCO2, and B is the response curve threshold. S slightly increased from hyperoxia to hypoxia in both BR and control groups. On the other hand, B moderately increased with hypoxia in BR patients, whereas it slightly decreased in controls. These changes were all not significant. However, in accordance with the change in B, the response curve to hypoxia at V of 10 1/min was significantly shifted in opposite directions in the two groups, i.e., rightward and leftward shift in BR and control groups, respectively. Thus the average magnitude of V calculated at PETCO2 of 40 Torr in hypoxia was significantly lower in BR patients than in controls (P less than 0.01). We conclude that this hypoxic depression of the CO2-ventilation response found in BR patients may have resulted, at least in part, from modulation of the brain stem neural mechanisms that were elicited by loss of afferent discharges from the carotid body.\r"

Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, reduced hypocapnia-induced bronchoconstriction by 88 +/- 6% (SE) but did not alter Na2EDTA-induced constriction.

The Fowler technique was used to determine VD on a breath-by-breath basis while the ponies breathed room air and inspired CO2 at 3 and 6%. During room air breathing, tidal volume (VT) and VD were greater in HND ponies than in normal and CBD ponies (P less than 0.05), and VT was less and VD/VT was greater after CBD than before CBD. For all groups. VD, VT, and breathing frequency (f) increased and VD/VT decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) with increasing inspired CO2. During CO2 breathing, VT and VD were higher (P less than 0.05) in the HND ponies than in all other groups, the decrease (P less than 0.05) in VD/VT was greatest in the CBD+HND group, and f was lower in the HND and HND+CBD than in the normal and CBD ponies. In addition, when inspired CO2 was increased from 0 to 6%, the decrease in VD/VT was greater and the increase in arterial PCO2 was less (P less than 0.05) after CBD than before CBD. For 70% of the ponies in all groups, VD increased linearly with increases in VT; for most of the remainder, VD tended to plateau at higher values of VT.\r"

In 15 sheep, specific lung resistance (sRL) was measured before and after 30 min of exposure to either air or a hypoxic gas mixture (13% O2). The sheep then inhaled 50 breaths of aerosolized 5% histamine solution (n = 9) or 10 breaths of 2.5% carbachol solution (n = 9), and measurements of sRL were repeated. On subsequent days the above protocols were repeated after a 30-min exposure to hyperoxia (O2 greater than or equal to 95%), without or after pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg). After air-sham exposure, carbachol and histamine increased mean sRL to 370 +/- 40 (SE) and 309 +/- 65% of baseline, respectively. Exposure to the hypoxic gas mixture had no effect on baseline sRL but enhanced the airway responsiveness to carbachol and histamine; mean sRL increased to 740 +/- 104 and 544 +/- 76% of baseline, respectively (P less than 0.05). Prior 30-min exposure to hyperoxia prevented the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity to carbachol (sRL = 416 +/- 66% of baseline) and histamine (sRL = 292 +/- 41% of baseline) without affecting the airway responsiveness to these agents after air. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not reverse the protective effects of hyperoxia or the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity. We conclude that 1) prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity and 2) neither the protective effects of hyperoxia nor the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity is mediated via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism.\r"

After the dives (depth 40-70 m, duration 88-151 s), end-tidal O2 pressure decreased from approximately 140 Torr to a minimum of 30.6 Torr, PETCO2 increased from approximately 25 Torr to a maximum of 47.0 Torr, and expired volume (BTPS) ranged from 1.32 to 2.86 liters.

To examine mechanisms responsible for these findings, renal and hormonal responses were studied in eight healthy male subjects (29.6 +/- 1.9 yr) before and immediately after four 20-min bouts of submaximal exercise (cycle ergometry) at work loads representing 25, 40, 60, and 80% of maximal oxygen consumption. Urine flow, osmotic clearance, glomerular filtration rate, and sodium excretion (UNa+V) all tended to rise at the 25% work load but were markedly reduced at the higher work intensities. Changes in urine flow paralleled changes in glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.91). Plasma vasopressin (ADH), aldosterone, and plasma renin activity tended to increase progressively with increases in work load, with the increases for all hormones reaching statistical significance when the level of exercise reached greater than or equal to 60% of maximal oxygen consumption. However, atrial natriuretic peptide was elevated (P less than 0.05) at all work loads from greater than 1.6-fold of control levels at the 25% work load to greater than 7-fold at the 80% work load. The increase in urine flow (6 of 8 subjects) and UNa+V (7 of 8 subjects) may be due to the increase in atrial natriuretic peptide and/or a 10% suppression (P less than 0.05) of ADH at the 25% work load.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because the reflex activity initiated by arterial chemoreceptors of the carotid body directly contributes to the integrated regulation of systemic blood pressure, we have investigated the possibility that ANP has a significant role in the chemosensory process as well. Our immunocytochemical studies show that ANP-like immunoreactivity is present in the preneural chemosensitive type I cells in the cat carotid body. Furthermore we found that the biologically active ANP fragment atriopeptin III is a potent inhibitor of carotid sinus nerve activity evoked by hypoxia. Our findings suggest that circulating and/or endogenous ANP may modulate carotid body function as part of a coordinated response to changes in systemic volume and solute balance.\r"

When pulmonary vasomotor tone was actively increased by intralobar infusion of U-46619, intralobar bolus injections of ET-1 (1 microgram), ET-2 (1 microgram), and ET-3 (3 micrograms) produced marked reductions in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances. The pulmonary vasodilator response to each ET isopeptide was not altered by atropine (1 mg/kg iv), indomethacin (2.5 mg/kg iv), and ICI 118551 (1 mg/kg iv) but was significantly diminished by glybenclamide (5 mg/kg iv). This dose of glybenclamide significantly diminished the decrease in lobar arterial and systemic arterial pressures in response to intralobar injection of pinacidil (30 and 100 micrograms) and cromakalim (10 and 30 micrograms), whereas pulmonary vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (0.03 and 0.1 microgram), prostaglandin I2 (0.1 and 0.3 microgram), and isoproterenol (0.03 and 0.1 microgram) were not altered. The systemic vasodilator response to each ET isopeptide was not changed by glybenclamide or by the other blocking agents studied. The present data comprise the first publication demonstrating that ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3 dilate the pulmonary vascular bed in vivo. The present data further suggest that the pulmonary vasodilator response to ET isopeptides depends, in part, on activation of potassium channels and is mediated differently from the systemic vasodilator response to these substances. Contrary to earlier work, the present data indicate the pulmonary vascular response to ET isopeptides does depend on the preexisting level of pulmonary vasomotor tone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty guinea pigs were subjected to a flame burn covering 50% total body surface area. One hour before burn injury, half of the animals underwent gavage with 3 x 10(10) viable C. albicans, a dosage that in previous studies was associated with greater than 90% incidence of yeast translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. The other half underwent gavage with an equal volume of saline. After injury, half of each group were randomly selected to receive guinea pig feed ad libitum and the other half were starved for 72 hours. All were allowed access to water ad libitum. Mortality rate was recorded at 3 3 days. The group that underwent gavage with C. albicans and subsequent starvation after burn injury had a significantly higher mortality rate than had any of the other groups. We conclude that induced translocation of C. albicans in guinea pigs increases mortality after burn injury. Moreover, early enteral feeding has a protective effect, presumably by decreasing translocation rates has been shown in previous studies.\r"

Increased flora from optimization of bacterial growth by pH elevation, coupled with the decreased intestinal motility common among patients whose mucosal integrity has been compromised, may increase the incidence of translocation. Gastric pH in these patients is monitored and maintained around pH 6 by various agents to reduce susceptibility to stress ulceration. Whole milk, given as a nutrient source, also raises pH. An in vitro trial simulating gastric fluid under conditions found in patients with burns was conducted to evaluate the growth of commonly ingested bacteria. Bicarbonate buffer containing pepsin and adjusted to pH 2, 4, or 7 with HCl was dosed with magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacid (Maalox) (10 ml), sucralfate (Carafate) (0.4 gm), or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (10 ng) before inoculation with Escherichia coli (3 x 10(2) organisms), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 x 10(2) organisms), or Staphylococcus aureus (2 x 10(1) organisms). Bacterial growth and pH were determined periodically over the 24-hour trial. Milk was added at intervals in half the samples to simulate patient feeding. Maalox increased pH in all samples containing milk (initially pH 2, 4, or 7) to over 7.0 in 2 hours, and increased pH more slowly without milk. Carafate had a moderating effect, increasing pH 2 and pH 4 and decreasing pH 7, with a narrower pH range found in the milk groups. PGE2 treatments combined with milk also increased pH 2 and pH 4, but slightly elevated pH 7 within 24 hours. Without milk, PGE2 did not alter pH from initial values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The only difference in treatment between the two groups was the start of early enteral nutritional support in group 2.

The following parameters were compared: lag time between hospital admission and the beginning of nutritional support, energy intake, nitrogen intake during the 4-week postadmission period, and length of care. A regression analysis including all patients was also performed to identify the factors associated with length of care.

  ".W": "Adrenal androgen production and adrenocortical biosynthesis are frequently abnormal in women with hyperandrogenism. It is possible that these abnormalities result from hypertestosteronemia of ovarian origin. We prospectively studied the effect of prolonged testosterone (T) administration on adrenocortical biosynthesis and basal hormone levels in seven oophorectomized euandrogenic volunteers, who received 20 mg T in oil (USP), im, three times weekly for 3 weeks. Blood was sampled before T administration (week 0), during therapy (weeks 1, 2, and 3), and 1 week after discontinuation of the medication (week 4). Acute adrenal stimulation using 250 micrograms ACTH-(1-24), iv, was performed on weeks 0, 2, and 3. Circulating T rose from an average of 1.53 nmol/L to 27.9 nmol/L by the end of week 3. Both LH and FSH decreased with T administration, while PRL rose slightly during the initial weeks of T therapy. Little change was observed in the basal levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, estrone, and estradiol. Androstenedione (A) rose concurrent with T administration and normalized after therapy discontinuation. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) decreased significantly with T administration, while DHA sulfate (DHS) increased, leading to an increased DHS/DHA ratio. Total cortisol (F) decreased during T therapy; however, corticosteroid-binding globulin levels also decreased, and the unbound F level remained unchanged. No significant change in adrenocortical response (measured by either the absolute poststimulation level or the net increment in steroid levels) for any steroid was noted after T administration. Although the absolute poststimulation level of A was higher during T administration, this change reflected the increased basal A levels, since the increment in A from 0-60 min was not different. In conclusion, raising endogenous T levels in oophorectomized healthy women 10- to 15-fold for a period of 3 weeks produced a decrease in circulating total F and corticosteroid-binding globulin levels, while maintaining normal levels of unbound F. Although the very high T levels produced in this study resulted in an increased DHS/DHA serum ratio, it remains to be proven that the lesser degree of hypertestosteronemia usually observed in hyperandrogenic patients is sufficient to alter DHS metabolism. With this exception, the adrenocortical biosynthetic abnormalities frequently noted in hyperandrogenism do not appear to result from the elevated circulating T levels.\r"

This effect was proposed to be mediated by suppression of pituitary gonadotropin release. The present in vitro study investigated effects of human gonadotropin (Pergonal LH/FSH, 1:1) and Lupron, a GnRH agonist, on proliferation of an ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, which is estrogen receptor negative and grows well in serum-free, defined medium. Pergonal, 10 IU/mL or 30 IU/mL, did not enhance cell proliferation, which argues against stabilization of ovarian tumors in vivo due to decreased serum gonadotropin. Lupron, 1.4 micrograms/mL and 140 micrograms/mL, retarded cell division by day 6-8 of culture, in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric cell cycle phase DNA analysis demonstrated Lupron caused a reversible 5-6% increase in the portion of cells in rest phase, G0/G1, compared to controls during log growth, and a corresponding decrease in the portion of cells in DNA synthesis, S phase. However, long-term culture, 3 weeks, with Lupron failed to arrest cells in G0/G1, and experimental cultures plateaued at cell number similar to control cultures. We conclude Lupron's effect on ovarian cancer cell proliferation is independent of gonadotropin and steroid, involves a cell cycle regulatory event, and duration of benefit observed in vivo for some patients may be related to total tumor volume at the time of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In search of a more physiological testosterone (T) replacement therapy for hypogonadal states, we evaluated an inclusion complex of T with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). HPBCD enhances T solubility and absorption, but HPBCD is not absorbed. Five hypogonadal men (mean age, 32.4 +/- 2.3 yr) with serum T levels below the normal range were treated in two separate experimental phases with either a 2.5- or 5.0-mg tablet of sublingual (SL) T-HPBCD three times daily for 7 days. Acute pharmacodynamic changes were monitored at baseline and 10, 20, and 40 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 8 h after administration of the first dose. At the 5-mg dose, a maximal concentration (Cmax) of T (85.4 +/- 11.0 nmol/L) was achieved in 20 min (63 +/- 24-fold increase), followed by a rapid decline to below the normal range (less than 12 nmol/L) at 2 h, with an estimated half-life of decline of 1.87 +/- 0.19 h. The dihydrotestosterone (DHT) Cmax (4.1 +/- 0.5 nmol/L) occurred at 32 +/- 5 min (8.9 +/- 1.3-fold increase) and declined to below the normal range (less than 1.2 nmol/L) after 3 h. The integrated 8 h value for the ratio of T/DHT was 10.0 +/- 1.1, which fell within the normal range. The increment in androstenedione paralleled that in T, and the Cmax (6.8 +/- 0.9 nmol/L) was reached in 24 +/- 4 min (2.3 +/- 0.6-fold increase). Compared to baseline, the Cmax was significantly greater for T (P less than 0.005), DHT (P less than 0.0005), and androstenedione (P less than 0.005). Both estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) remained in the normal range (less than 200 pmol/L), although the Cmax for E1 was significantly greater than baseline (P less than 0.05). Serum LH levels were suppressed (19.0 +/- 2.6%) at 2 h (P less than 0.05), without a significant change in FSH. During 7 days of treatment, there was no cumulative increase in basal T, DHT, and E2 levels or further decline in LH or FSH levels. There was no change in sex hormone-binding globulin levels. Similar results were observed with the 2.5-mg dose, suggesting that the capacity of SL absorption may be limited to a certain dose of T-HPBCD. The fluctuations in T after SL administration of T-HPBCD resemble endogenous episodic secretion. We conclude that T, complexed with HPBCD, is rapidly absorbed by the SL route and quickly metabolized without sustained elevations of DHT or E2.\r"

To assess their participation in GH feedback, we investigated the effect of pyridostigmine (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) on plasma GH responses to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) plus TRH, insulin hypoglycemia, and arginine as well as on the inhibition of these responses by exogenous GH. The GH response to each stimulus was inhibited by an infusion of GH (0.55 micrograms/m2/min), started 4 h earlier. Pyridostigmine (120 mg, orally), administered 30 min before the stimulus, enhanced GH responses to GHRH and insulin during both saline and GH infusions. However, GH responses during combined administration of pyridostigmine and GH were less than those during pyridostigmine alone. GH responses to arginine, in contrast, were not affected by pyridostigmine in either the absence or presence of exogenous GH. TSH responses to TRH were unaltered by either GH or pyridostigmine. Pyridostigmine enhancement of GH responses to a maximally stimulatory dose of GHRH suggests that its effect is exerted by inhibition of somatostatin release. The lack of effect of pyridostigmine on plasma GH responses to arginine suggests that arginine and pyridostigmine increase GH secretion through a common pathway. The enhancement by pyridostigmine of GH responses in both the presence and absence of exogenous GH suggests that exogenous GH and pyridostigmine exert their discordant effects on GH secretion through independent mechanisms.\r"

This hFF FSH-BI was further purified by removal of material insoluble in acidified acetone (pH 4.1) but soluble in diethyl ether (pH 10.5), followed by molecular sieving through Sephacryl S-100. FSH-BI activity eluted from S-100 with an elution volume similar to that of hFSH, but could be distinguished from hFSH on the basis of a differential sensitivity to acid inactivation. Human FSH was inactivated in acetone at pH 4.1 (1 h, 25 C), whereas hFF FSH-BI retained activity under these conditions. Human FF FSH-BI also demonstrated FSH-like agonist activity, defined as the ability to stimulate basal levels of estradiol synthesis in cultured rat Sertoli cells. Human FSH-BI strongly cross-reacted to a commercially available monoclonal antibody used to measure serum hFSH. Indeed, recovery of FSH immunologic activity was significantly greater (134-fold on a mass basis) after partial purification, indicating that antibody recognition sites were apparently masked in unfractionated hFF. In summary, large mol wt hFSH-BI has been partially purified from hFF and found to be similar in size to pituitary hFSH and to have FSH-like agonist activity in vitro. Although distinguishable from pituitary hFSH on the basis of stability to acid, hFSH-BI appears immunologically related to pituitary hFSH so that measurements of hFSH levels in hFF using immunologic techniques should be interpreted with caution.\r"

Although the cause of the goiter formation has been attributed to TRAb, the limited growth pattern of human adult thyroid cells in vitro has caused such a conclusion to be based on studies of nonhuman thyroid cell growth. We have recently characterized a predictable and precise technique for the measurement of human thyroid cell proliferation and function using fetal thyroid cells and have used this system to examine the influence of TRAb on human thyroid cell growth. Highly purified human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) preparations from normal individuals (n = 5) had no significant influence on human thyroid cell growth. However, hIgG from patients with detectable TRAb (TRAb-hIgG) (n = 13) induced a dose-related increase in extracellular cAMP (maximum effect at 0.1 mg/ml) and a 3-fold increase in human thyroid cell growth over a 4-day period (maximum effect at 1.5 mg/ml). Under basal thyroid cell culture conditions there were detectable, but low, levels of mRNA specific for the protooncogene c-fos, and this was markedly, and rapidly, induced by the addition of TRAb-hIgG but not normal hIgG. These data demonstrate induction of cellular growth by TRAb-hIgG in an homologous human thyroid cell culture system. Such observations support the hypothesis that goiter formation in patients with Graves' disease is, at least in part, secondary to the growth stimulating activity of TRAb-hIgG.\r"

The cytokine stimulated [3H]GAG accumulation in retroocular fibroblast cultures obtained from eight different donors by 36-124% above control values. In contrast, interferon gamma had no consistent effect on macromolecular accumulation in dermal fibroblast cultures derived from the pretibium or from areas ordinarily uninvolved in Graves' dermopathy. These results suggest that retroocular fibroblasts may be uniquely targeted for one action of interferon gamma which involves the modulation of GAG metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "To accrue systematic information in different ovulatory disorders on the precise relationship among endocrine response, clinical outcome, and the occurrence of complications, we treated 114 patients with pulsatile GnRH (2.5-5.0 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) for 187 cycles and compared them to 20 normal menstrual cycles. Thirty of these patients had primary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (PHA; 40 cycles), 33 had other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; 55 cycles), and 51 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 92 cycles). Daily blood samples were drawn for hormone determinations. In PCOS, 50 cycles were preceded by GnRH analog suppression. PHA treatment cycles were characterized by the reestablishment of a normal endocrine pattern, almost no dose-related endocrine differences, elevated ovulatory (93%) and conception rates (23%), and no multiple pregnancies. In the HH subjects the ovulatory (91%) and pregnancy rates (31%) were high; however, while the lower GnRH dose elicited a normal endocrine pattern, the 5-micrograms dose induced excessive folliculogenesis and high estradiol levels and was associated with most of the multiple pregnancies of this study (three of four). GnRH analog suppression was successfully used to avoid recurrence of ovarian over-stimulation in two HH subjects. Finally, GnRH analog suppression in PCOS permitted normalization of the follicular phase endocrine pattern, achievement of good ovulatory (76%) and pregnancy (28%) rates, and avoidance of multiple pregnancies; however, luteal phase steroid secretion was abnormal, and the abortion rate remained elevated (43%). Obesity was associated with a reduced ovulatory rate in PCOS, but not in hypogonadotropic, subjects. Thus, we can conclude that in pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction: 1) a profound hypogonadotropic condition, whether spontaneous as in PHA or induced with GnRH analogs as in other ovulatory disorders, is associated with optimal menstrual cycle restoration, high ovulatory and conception rates, and virtually absent risks of multiple pregnancy; 2) residual hypothalamic activity in HH may be responsible for supraphysiological pituitary-ovarian stimulation and result in multiple pregnancy unless a low GnRH dose (2.5 micrograms/bolus) or GnRH analog pretreatment is employed; 3) obesity does not affect treatment outcome in hypogonadotropic patients; and 4) the high spontaneous abortion rate in PCOS may be related to corpus luteum dysfunction.\r"

PHM (100 micrograms) was given as an iv bolus to eight patients with active acromegaly, and plasma GH levels were measured before and at intervals up to 120 min after the injection. For comparison, the effects of TRH (500 micrograms) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP, 100 micrograms), peptides known to paradoxically stimulate GH secretion in acromegalics, were assessed in all of the patients. A paradoxical rise (greater than 50% above the basal) in plasma GH was observed in five patients after both TRH and VIP administrations, although TRH responders were not always VIP responders, nor did VIP responders always respond to TRH. In two patients, the GH response to PHM fulfilled the criteria of a paradoxical increase. Both of these patients were also TRH and VIP responders. These results suggest that PHM may be another hypothalamic hormone capable of paradoxically stimulating GH secretion in at least some acromegalics, although PHM appears to be a less potent stimulator of GH release than TRH and VIP. The pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon is yet to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the differential sensitivity of the ovary to temporary withdrawal of gonadotropin support at different stages of folliculogenesis and corpus luteum function, GnRH antagonist blockade of gonadotropin secretion was examined in 17 studies using the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist. A vehicle control, antagonist treatment, and follow-up cycle format was used in each study. A previously determined ED100 dose of the Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist (150 micrograms/kg) or vehicle was administered sc every 24 h for 3 consecutive days in the midfollicular phase (MFP), late follicular phase (LFP), and midluteal phase (MLP). In studies in the MFP (n = 7), the largest follicle was 11 +/- 2 mm (mean +/- SEM), and the mean estradiol (E2) level was 220 +/- 44 pmol/L on the first day of antagonist administration. Administration of the antagonist resulted in a 75 +/- 6% suppression of LH (P less than 0.005), no significant change in FSH, and suppression of E2 to the assay detection limit (P less than 0.05). Total cycle length was increased compared to that of the vehicle control cycle (37.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 26.3 +/- 1.1 days; (P less than 0.005) due to prolongation of follicular phase length (P less than 0.005) and reinitiation of folliculogenesis. In the LFP (n = 5), the largest follicle was 16 +/- 1 mm (P less than 0.05 vs. MFP), and the E2 level was 394 +/- 95 pmol/L (P less than 0.05 vs. MFP) on the first day of antagonist administration. Antagonist administration resulted in a 65 +/- 6% suppression of LH (P less than 0.05), a 47 +/- 11% decrease in FSH (P less than 0.05), and no significant change in E2. Total cycle length was prolonged (32.4 +/- 2.2 vs. 25.6 +/- 0.4 days; P less than 0.05) due to an increase in follicular phase length (P less than 0.02); however, the prolongation of the follicular phase was significantly less than that of the MFP (8.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 15.1 +/- 0.1 days; P less than 0.001), suggesting ovulation from the initial dominant follicle. In studies in the MLP (n = 5), LH, E2, and progesterone decreased to the assay detection limit after antagonist administration, while FSH decreased by 36 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05). Menstrual bleeding occurred within 24-48 h of the final Nal-Glu antagonist injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles (HLA-DR and DQ) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) in 20 patients with APA (lupus anticoagulant). HLA-DQw7 (DQB1*0301), linked to HLA-DR5 and -DR4 haplotypes, occurred in 70% and was significantly increased compared to 139 race-matched normal controls (P = 0.002, P corrected [pc] = 0.05, odds ratio [OR] = 5.1). Moreover, the frequency of HLA-DQw7 was significantly higher in SLE patients with APA as compared with patients without APA but with other autoantibodies, including anti-Ro and La (P = 0.0001, pc = 0.002, OR = 10.7), anti-Ro alone (P = 0.001, pc = 0.02, OR = 11.2), anti-dsDNA (P = 0.001, pc = 0.02, OR = 7.1), and possibly anti-Sm (P = 0.04, pc = NS, OR = 6.8) and anti-nRNP (U1-RNP) (P = 0.01, pc = NS, OR = 7.8). The DQB1*0301 allele of DQw7 showed the strongest association, while the frequencies of the DQA1*0301 (45%) and DQA1*0501 (50%) alleles did not differ from the controls. Among the HLA-DQB1*0301 (DQw7) negative patients, all possessed HLA-DQw8 (DQB1*0302) and/or HLA-DQw6 (DQB1*0602 or DQB1*0603) alleles. The HLA-DQB1*0301 chain shares an identical seven amino acid sequence with DQB1*0302, *0602, and *0603 chains in the third hypervariable region of the HLA-DQ molecule. This candidate \"epitope\" may play a role in mediating an autoimmune response to APA.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) and GTP-gamma-S, known activators of GTP binding proteins, on proton transport were investigated in endosome-enriched vesicles (endosomes). Endosomes were prepared from rabbit renal cortex following the intravenous injection of FITC-dextran. The rate of intravesicular acidification was determined by measuring changes in fluorescence of FITC-dextran. Both GTP and GTP-gamma-S stimulated significantly the initial rate of proton transport. In contrast, GDP-beta-S, which does not activate GTP binding proteins, inhibited proton transport. The rank order of stimulation was GTP-gamma-S greater than GTP greater than control greater than GDP-beta-S. GTP-gamma-S stimulation of proton transport was also observed under conditions in which chloride entry was eliminated, i.e., 0 mM external chloride concentration in the presence of potassium/valinomycin voltage clamping. GTP-gamma-S did not affect proton leak in endosomes as determined by collapse of H+ ATPase-generated pH gradients. ADP ribosylation by treatment of endosomal membranes with pertussis toxin revealed two substrates corresponding to the 39-41 kD region and comigrating with alpha i subunits. Pretreatment of the membranes with pertussis toxin had no effect on proton transport in the absence of GTP or GTP-gamma-S. However, pretreatment with pertussis toxin blocked the stimulation of proton transport by GTP. In contrast, as reported in other membranes by others previously, pertussis toxin did not prevent the stimulation of proton transport by GTP-gamma-S. These findings, taken together, indicate that GTP binding proteins are present in endosomal membranes derived from renal cortex and that activation of G protein by GTP and GTP-gamma-S stimulates proton transport in a rank order identical to that reported for other transport pathways modulated by Gi proteins. Therefore, these studies suggest that G proteins are capable of stimulating the vacuolar H ATPase of endosomes directly.\r"

Analysis of T cell receptor genes revealed identical rearrangements of T cell receptor beta chain genes, suggesting clonality of these T cells. CD4+/CD8+ T cells clones were found to be efficiently cytotoxic towards autologous lymphoblasts. Autocytotoxicity could be blocked by a CD3 MAb, a MAb specific for monomorphic MHC class II determinants, and particularly, by an MHC-DP-specific MAb, suggesting specificity for autologous DP molecules. Perhaps more important, CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones inhibited differentiation of autologous progenitor enriched bone marrow cells in vitro by a direct cell-mediated mechanism. These data suggest that circulating cytotoxic CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones specific for autologous MHC-DP determinants may be involved in hematopoietic failure in some cases of aplastic anemia.\r"

Increases in rates of catabolism have been documented in patients with HANE and certainly account for some of decrease in C1 INH level. A possible role for a decrease in synthesis of C1 INH in producing serum levels of C1 INH below the expected 50% of normal has not been well studied. We studied the synthesis of C1 INH in skin fibroblast lines, which produce easily detectable amounts of C1 INH. In type I HANE cells, C1 INH synthesis was 19.6 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD) of normal, much less than the 50% predicted. In type II HANE cells, the total amount of C1 INH synthesis (functional and dysfunctional) was 98.9 +/- 17% of normal; the functional protein comprised 43% of the total. Thus, type II HANE cells synthesized functional C1 INH at a much greater rate than for the type I cells. In both type I and II HANE cells, amounts of steady-state C1 INH mRNA levels paralleled rates of C1 INH synthesis, indicating that control of C1 INH synthesis occurred at pretranslational levels. Both type I and type II fibroblasts synthesized normal amounts of C1r and C1s. These data suggest that the lower than expected amounts of functionally active C1 INH in type I HANE may be due, in part, to a decrease in rate of synthesis of the protein, and that the expressions of the normal C1 INH allele in HANE is influenced by the type of abnormal allele present.\r"

RSA was measured in nine anesthetized dogs, first during spontaneous breathing (SB) and then during constant flow ventilation (CFV), a technique whereby phasic chest wall movements and thoracic pressure swings are eliminated. Measurements of the heart rate and of the moving time averaged (MTA) phrenic neurogram during these two ventilatory modes were made during progressive hypercapnia and progressive hypoxia. RSA divided by the MTA phrenic amplitude (RSAa) showed a power-law relationship with both arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) and oxygen saturation (SaO2), but with different exponents for different conditions. However, the power-law relation between RSAa and respiratory frequency had an exponent indistinguishable from -2 whether hypoxia or hypercapnia was the stimulus for increased respiratory drive, and during both CFV and spontaneous breathing (-1.9 +/- 0.4, hypoxia, SB; -1.8 +/- 0.7, hypoxia, CFV; -2.1 +/- 0.8, hypercapnia, SB; -1.9 +/- 0.7, hypercapnia, CFV). We conclude that respiratory sinus arrhythmia is centrally mediated and directly related to respiratory drive, and that changes in blood gases and phasic afferent signals affect RSA primarily by influencing respiratory drive.\r"

This study was designed to investigate the pulmonary and urinary clearance of ANF before and after the initiation of acute experimental CHF in dogs, and to assess the contribution of enzymatic degradation to these clearances in CHF. This study demonstrated a significant clearance of plasma ANF across the pulmonary circulation at baseline, and a tendency for pulmonary clearance to decrease in CHF (1115 +/- 268 to 498 +/- 173 ml/min, NS). The pulmonary extraction of ANF present at baseline was not altered with acute CHF (36.0 +/- 7.8 to 34.9 +/- 12.1%, NS). NEP inhibition (NEPI) abolished both the clearance and extraction of plasma ANF across the lung in CHF. Similarly, significant urinary clearance of ANF was present at baseline, and in acute CHF the urinary clearance of ANF decreased (0.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.02 +/- 0.01 ml/min, P less than 0.05). NEPI prevented the decrease in the urinary clearance of ANF, and enhanced the renal response to endogenous ANF, independent of further increases in plasma ANF during CHF. This study supports an important role for NEP in the pulmonary and urinary metabolism of endogenous ANF during acute CHF.\r"

In LLC-PK1 membranes, several ATP analogues inhibit basal, GTP-, forskolin-, and AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a dose-dependent manner. The rank order potency of inhibition by ATP analogues suggests that a P2y type of ATP receptor is involved in this inhibition. The compound ATP gamma S inhibits agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in solubilized and in isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and quinacrine pretreated membranes, suggesting that ATP gamma S inhibition occurs independent of AVP and A1 adenosine receptors and of phospholipase A2 activity. The ATP gamma S inhibition of AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is not affected by pertussis toxin but is attenuated by GDP beta S, suggesting a possible role for a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein in the inhibition. Exposure of intact LLC-PK cells to ATP gamma S results in a significant increase in protein kinase C activity. However, neither of two protein kinase C inhibitors (staurosporine and H-7) prevents ATP gamma S inhibition of AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting that this inhibition occurs by a protein kinase C independent mechanism. These findings suggest the presence of functional P2y purinoceptors coupled to two signal transduction pathways in cultured renal epithelial cells. The effect of P2y purinoceptors to inhibit AVP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity may be mediated, at least in part, by a pertussis toxin insensitive G protein.\r"

  ".W": "Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxins (LT) are responsible in part for \"traveler's diarrhea\" and related diarrheal illnesses. The family of LTs comprises two serogroups termed LT-I and LT-II; each serogroup includes two or more antigenic variants. The effects of LTs result from ADP ribosylation of Gs alpha, a stimulatory component of adenylyl cyclase; the mechanism of action is identical to that of cholera toxin (CT). The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of CT is enhanced by 20-kD guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, known as ADP-ribosylation factors or ARFs. These proteins directly activate the CTA1 catalytic unit and stimulate its ADP ribosylation of Gs alpha, other proteins, and simple guanidino compounds (e.g., agmatine). Because of the similarities between CT and LTs, we investigated the effects of purified bovine brain ARF and a recombinant form of bovine ARF synthesized in Escherichia coli on LT activity. ARF enhanced the LT-I-, LT-IIa-, and LT-IIb-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of agmatine, as well as the auto-ADP ribosylation of the toxin catalytic unit. Stimulation of ADP-ribosylagmatine formation by LTs and CT in the presence of ARF was GTP dependent and enhanced by sodium dodecyl sulfate. With agmatine as substrate, LT-IIa and LT-IIb exhibited less than 1% the activity of CT and LT-Ih. CT and LTs catalyzed ADP-ribosyl-Gs alpha formation in a reaction dependent on ARF, GTP, and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholate. With Gs alpha as substrate, the ADP-ribosyltransferase activities of the toxins were similar, although CT and LT-Ih appeared to be slightly more active than LT-IIa and LT-IIb. Thus, LT-IIa and LT-IIb appear to differ somewhat from CT and LT-Ih in substrate specificity. Responsiveness to stimulation by ARF, GTP, and phospholipid/detergent as well as the specificity of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity are functions of LTs from serogroups LT-I and LT-II that are shared with CT.\r"

We reviewed the medical records of all admissions to a chronic care hospital over a 13-month period, collecting data on selected patient characteristics, use of DNR orders, and patient outcomes during the 6-week period following admission. Fifty-eight of the 301 patients (19.3%) had a DNR order written. Patients' families were involved predominantly in the DNR decision in 73% of the cases while patients themselves were involved in only 18%. Physicians made the decision unilaterally in 6% of the cases. Patients' functional status rather than specific diagnoses predicted the use of DNR orders. Patients with DNR orders were twice as likely to receive new intravenous therapies than patients without those orders (71% vs 33%, P less than 0.01) and four times as likely to die (38% vs 9%, P less than 0.01). They were no more likely to be transferred emergently to an acute care hospital (5% vs 9%, P greater than 0.2). We conclude that DNR orders are not infrequently used, and physicians rarely make the decision unilaterally. Patients with DNR orders have a high likelihood of dying and are infrequently transferred to acute care facilities.\r"

The patient had the clinical and histopathologic features of disseminated pagetoid reticulosis, a rare form of CTCL characterized by a strong epidermotropic lymphoid infiltrate. Extensive immuno-cytochemical studies showed that the neoplastic cells were almost exclusively localized in the epidermis, expressed the gamma/delta variant of the T-cell receptor (CD3+, TCR-delta-1+) and were CD5+, CD7+, CD27+, CD29+, CD43+, CD44+, CD45+, CD45RA+, CD54+, CD69+, but beta F1-, Ti gamma a-, BB3-, A13-, CD2-, CD4-, CD8-, CD11a-, CD49d-, CD25-, CD30-, and HLA-DR-. A comparison of our results with those of the literature, which have not included gamma/delta T-cell receptor analysis, suggests that some reported cases of pagetoid reticulosis may have phenotypes similar to our case. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that the gamma/delta T lymphocytes were villous, containing dense and multivesicular bodies, and formed close contacts with the surrounding keratinocytes, suggesting that these cells should have a role in the skin-associated lymphoid tissue. The proliferating cells in our case might represent the neoplastic counterpart of the recently reported CD2- subset of normal human peripheral blood gamma/delta T lymphocytes.\r"

We demonstrate, using beta-actin and SV40 (late) transcription promoting sequences, that this technically refined microtiter-triton-lysate (MTL) assay methodology can readily differentiate between the transcriptional states of human melanocytes before and after pharmacologic stimulation and malignantly transformed versus normal cell environments. Differences in the transcriptional environments are revealed by the relative expression of transcription element probes. The transcriptional activity ratio of the beta-actin compared to the SV40 late transcription promoting sequences was approximately 1:2 in primary cultured melanocytes, 2:1 in 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-treated melanocytes and 1:4 in the Tang melanoma cell line. Because this MTL assay methodology can accommodate a panel of transcription element probes, we anticipate that the resultant transcriptional profiles will prove useful in deciphering the diverse transcriptional changes that occur within normally regulated and malignantly transformed cells.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the histogenesis of lymphomatoid papulosis (LYP), we have analyzed the configuration of the beta, gamma, and delta T-cell receptor (TCR) and Ig genes in DNA from 31 biopsies of 18 patients with this condition and also from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of eight of these patients. Immunoglobulin genes were in a germ-line configuration in all patients, and TCR genes were in a germ-line configuration in six patients. In nine patients, one or two rearranged bands (RB) were detected with both beta and gamma TCR probes and in one patient with beta, gamma, and delta TCR probes. Two patients, in whom beta and delta TCR genes were in a germline configuration, had evidence of multiple discrete rearrangements of gamma TCR genes, consistent with a polyclonal T-cell population. Analysis of multiple biopsies revealed that RB, when present, were identical in different lesions from individual patients. All but one of the peripheral blood samples showed a germ-line configuration. The exception had evidence of a rearrangement of gamma and delta in peripheral blood and a beta and gamma rearrangement within tissue. This study has established that only a proportion of patients with LYP have a monoclonal T-cell proliferation. Correlation with the clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic data revealed that a T-cell clone was limited to patients with Willemze type B LYP or \"mixed type\" LYP, whereas patients with type A LYP consistently showed a germline configuration of TCR genes. This study indicates that in LYP the atypical hyperchromatic cerebriform mononuclear cells of type B invariably constitute a monoclonal T-cell population whereas the atypical CD30 positive type A cells represent a proliferation of cells of non-B, non-T-cell lineage.\r"

After 48 hours' exposure to immune mediators, such as culture supernatant of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma; 1,000 U/ml), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha; 2,000 U/ml), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha; 1,000 U/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 micrograms/ml), ICAM-1 expression on both cell types was markedly increased in terms of intensity and cell numbers. IFN-gamma and culture supernatant of PHA-stimulated lymphocytes were the most potent inducers of ICAM-1 among the mediators tested, while TNF-alpha, IL-alpha and LPS were less effective, although variations were observed among cultures derived from different donors. Cytokine-induced expression of ICAM-1 on glial cells may play a role in mediating lymphocyte-glial cell interactions at sites of inflammation in the central nervous system.\r"

Iodine-131-3F8 detected more abnormal sites (283) than [131I] MIBG (138) or 99mTc-MDP (69), especially in patients with extensive disease. In 20 patients with soft-tissue tumors demonstrated by CT/MRI, 131I-3F8 detected the disease in 18. Upon surgical resection, two tumors interpreted as negative with 131I-3F8 imaging revealed ganglioneuroma, one showing microscopic foci of neuroblastoma. In contrast, 131I-3F8 imaging identified tumors that were confirmed histologically as neuroblastomas. In 26 patients with evidence of marrow disease by antibody scans, 14/26 had confirmation by iliac crest marrow aspirate/biopsy examinations. We conclude that 131I-3F8 scintigraphy has clinical utility in the management of patients with neuroblastoma by improving the sensitivity of tumor detection.\r"

Indium-111-antimyosin Fab imaging could not be performed because of cardiogenic shock. However, postmortem gamma scintillation counting revealed increased activities of antimyosin Fab in the inferoapical and right ventricular infarcted regions in which 99mTc-pyrophosphate positive imagings were observed; in contrast, a histologically confirmed old subendocardial anterior infarction had no definite activity. Thus, the myocardial distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab corresponded well to the results of 99mTc scintigrams and histologic examinations in a human heart, suggesting that this technique could be useful in vivo for detecting several-day-old myocardial infarction of the right ventricle as well as the left ventricle. Tissue from the 2-yr-old infarction was not identified by this technique.\r"

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood specimens were analyzed by the Nutrition Evaluation Laboratory at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. Both subjects had biochemical evidence of protein-calorie malnutrition and were deficient or marginally deficient in several vitamins and trace minerals. CONCLUSIONS: Much work needs to be done to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the classic physical signs of malnutrition as predictors of low biochemical levels and adverse clinical outcomes. The presence of atrophic glossitis should prompt the clinician to consider a basic nutritional assessment.\r"

The infectious recombinant adenoviruses Adgag1, AdSVgag1, and AdSVCA1 were shown to express the appropriate HIV-1 antigens in human cells in vitro, as measured by immunoprecipitation and p24 antigen capture assays. Using the p24 antigen capture assay, HIV antigen expressed by AdSVCA1 was detected earlier in infection and in greater amounts than that produced by either Adgag1 or AdSVgag1. In studies concerning the immunogenicity of these vectors, Balb/c (H-2d) mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 10(7) or 10(8) plaque-forming units of purified vector developed serum antibodies to p24, detected by Western blotting, by 2 weeks postinjection. In the preliminary test of the immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus vectors in primates, two of four rhesus macaque monkeys generated antibodies to HIV-1 p24 following two injections of AdSVCA1. As expected, monkeys injected with control adenovirus failed to show any anti-HIV response, and none of the monkeys showed any adverse reactions following infection with either recombinant or control adenoviruses. These results suggest that adenovirus vectors have considerable potential in the study of possible immune therapies for HIV infection.\r"

Before ischemia both acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and nitroglycerin, and endothelium-independent vasodilator, caused coronary vasodilation. After ischemia the response to acetylcholine was impaired in the eight hearts with high initial reperfusion pressure (60 mm Hg) but was intact in the eight hearts with low initial reperfusion pressure (20 mm Hg for 10 minutes, 40 mm Hg for 10 minutes, and then 60 mm Hg thereafter). The response to nitroglycerin, however, remained intact regardless of initial reperfusion pressure. Recovery of resting coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption was lower in the group with high pressure reperfusion than in the group with low pressure reperfusion. On reperfusion a transient burst of coronary flow was exhibited by the hearts reperfused at high pressure. These results suggest that high initial reperfusion pressure impairs the endothelial modulation of coronary tone; this may be related to the effects on the coronary vasculature of the \"burst\" of coronary flow associated with high intravascular pressure.\r"

  ".W": "Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has become established for selected infants with severe forms of congenital heart disease. This study reviews the combined experience and intermediate term results of infants undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation from Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, and Kosair Children's Hospital, Louisville. From June 1986 through December 1989, 20 orthotopic cardiac transplantations were performed in 19 patients. Sixteen patients had variants of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One infant had anomalous origin of the left coronary artery with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two infants had aortic stenosis with endocardial fibroelastosis, and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to transplantation. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran), and corticosteroids with an effort to wean the patients from steroids by 6 months to 2 years. Three early deaths resulted--from technical errors in two patients and from hyperacute rejection in one patient at 3 days. Four late deaths have occurred. Two patients died at 2 and 13 months of acute rejection. One patient died at 15 months of acute rejection after retransplantation. One patient died at 7 months of respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia. The remaining 12 patients are surviving 5 to 47 months (means 20 months) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Rejection surveillance in the first 6 months is by clinical signs supplemented by echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cell cycle analysis; endomyocardial biopsy is used after 6 months of age. For the cumulative series, 24 episodes of suspected rejection have been treated during 277 at-risk patient months with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) (n = 18) and monoclonal antibody (OKT3) (n = 6), for an incidence of 1.04 episodes of rejection per patient per year. Serious posttransplantation infections including endocarditis, catheter sepsis, meningitis, and colonic perforation were successfully treated in four patients. Subjectively, their quality of life is excellent as shown by normal growth and developmental milestones and a low hospital readmission rate (1.4 episodes per patient per year). These encouraging intermediate term results warrant continued application of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation for severe forms of congenital heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Entry of a cell into mitosis induces a series of structural and functional changes including arrest of intracellular transport. Knowledge of how the mitotic cycle is driven progressed substantially with the identification of the p34cdc2 protein kinase as a subunit of maturation-promoting factor, the universal regulating component of the mitotic cycle. Activation of the kinase at the onset of mitosis is thought to trigger the important mitotic events by phosphorylating key proteins. Small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins have been implicated in regulating transport pathways. For instance, two small Ras-related GTP-binding proteins, Sec4p and Ypt1p, control distinct stages of the secretory pathway in budding yeast. The GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family in rats and humans display strong homologies with Sec4p and Ypt1p, and might therefore also be involved in regulating intracellular transport. Indeed, distinct Rab proteins are located in the exocytotic and endocytotic compartments. Interruption of vesicular transport during mitosis might involve modification of these proteins. We now present biochemical evidence for a mitosis-specific p34cdc2 phosphorylation of Rab1Ap and Rab4p. By contrast, Rab2p and Rab6p are not phosphorylated. We also show that the distribution of Rab1Ap and Rab4p between cytosolic and membrane-bound forms is different in interphase and mitotic cells. This may provide a clue to the mechanism by which phosphorylation could affect membrane traffic during mitosis.\r"

  ".U": "91219401\r", 
  ".W": "Liver regeneration provides one of the few systems for analysis of mitogenesis in the fully developed, intact animal. Several proteins have been identified as part of the primary growth response in regenerating liver and in mitogen-stimulated cells. Some of these proteins, such as the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors, are thought to have a role in activating transcription of genes expressed subsequently in the growth response. Through differential screening of a regenerating-liver cDNA library, we have identified a rapidly and highly induced gene encoding a 21-kDa leucine-zipper-containing protein that we have designated liver regeneration factor 1 (LRF-1). LRF-1 has no homology with other leucine-zipper proteins outside the basic and leucine-zipper domains. LRF-1 alone can bind DNA, but it preferentially forms heteromeric complexes with c-Jun and Jun-B and does not interact with c-Fos. In solution, it binds with highest affinity to cAMP response elements but also has affinity for related sites. In cotransfection studies, LRF-1 in combination with c-Jun strongly activates a c-Jun-responsive promoter. The induction of the LRF-1 gene in regenerating liver greatly increases the potential variety of heterodimeric combinations of leucine-zipper transcription factors. While LRF-1 mRNA is rapidly induced in the absence of protein synthesis, its peak induction is later than c-fos mRNA, suggesting that LRF-1 may regulate responsive genes at a later point in the cell cycle. As such, LRF-1 may have a unique and critical role in growth regulation of regenerating liver and mitogen-stimulated cells.\r"

  ".U": "91219405\r", 
  ".W": "CHO-K1 cells, wild type (WT), grow in a defined medium with insulin as the only essential hormone. When starved for insulin, these cells accumulate in G0/G1 stage. Insulin binding to its receptor stimulates DNA synthesis and cell division and induces an increase in abundance of mRNA for c-fos, c-jun, Krox-20, Krox-24 (zif/268), fra-1, jun-B, c-myc, and JE. The kinetics of induction of these genes are similar to that shown with serum induction of 3T3. These genes show maximum stimulation at insulin concentrations of 20, 160, or 320 ng/ml and their expression is inhibited at higher concentrations. The addition of cycloheximide results in superinduction. The WT and insulin-independent mutants show no detectable signal for KC, fos-b, or nur77 and no increase over the basal level of pI-15, probably eliminating these genes as participants in the insulin mitogenic signal. These mutants synthesize DNA in the absence of insulin at rates that vary from 4 to 12 times that of the quiescent (insulin unstimulated) WT and are further inducible by insulin. The mutants have \"constitutive\" levels of Krox-24 (zif/268), fra-1, jun-B, c-myc, and JE (INS-type 2 genes) mRNAs that vary from mutant to mutant, reaching a maximum of an 8-fold increase for fra-1 and JE over the quiescent WT levels. There were no detectable levels of mRNA for genes c-fos and Krox-20 and no increase in level of mRNA for c-jun (INS-type 1 genes) as compared to the quiescent WT. Thus, although these INS-type 1 and type 2 genes may be involved in the full insulin mitogenic signal, the constitutive up-regulation of only genes in INS-type 2 is sufficient for insulin-independent DNA synthesis and cell division. Analysis of hybrids constructed between WT and mutant 27 indicate that the mutant phenotype is recessive, pointing to the existence of a regulatory gene producing a negative regulator.\r"

In this report, nanomolar concentrations of S100 beta are shown to stimulate proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells and primary astrocytes. An S100 mutant with a single amino acid change was inactive. S100 beta also stimulated increases in the steady-state levels of c-myc and c-fos protooncogene mRNAs and complemented the effects of platelet-derived growth factor. Two neuroblastoma cell lines did not proliferate in response to S100 beta, suggesting that the mitogenic activity of S100 beta is selective for astroglial cells. These results suggest that S100 beta may be involved in the coordinate development and maintenance of the central nervous system by synchronously stimulating the differentiation of neurons and the proliferation of astroglia.\r"

Both intact RAR molecules and the DNA binding domain bind to the cognate DNA response element with high specificity in the absence of retinoic acid. However, this binding is enhanced to a great extent upon the addition of eukaryotic cell extracts. The factor responsible for this enhancement is heat-sensitive and forms a complex with RAR that binds to DNA and exhibits a distinct migration pattern in the gel-mobility-shift assay. The interaction site of the factor with RAR is localized in the 70-amino acid DNA binding region of RAR. The hormone binding ability of the RAR alpha protein was assayed by a charcoal absorption assay and the RAR protein was found to bind to retinoic acid with a Kd of 2.1 x 10(-10) M.\r"

However, currently available recombinant fusion protein C100-3 assays, based on a nonstructural protein of the virus, are limited in sensitivity, particularly for detecting acute infection. In this report seroconversion panels showed that an assay based on synthetic peptides, derived from immunodominant regions of both capsid and nonstructural proteins, accelerated hepatitis C virus antibody detection by 4-10 weeks. In screening, this enzyme immunoassay increased detection from 47% to 64% in plasmapheresis donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (greater than 100 international units per liter), from 15% to 24% in anti-hepatitis B core antigen-positive blood donors, and from 28% to 42% in renal dialysis patients when compared with nonstructural peptide-based assays. The screening assay was repeatedly reactive for 27 of 2902 volunteer blood donor samples (0.93%); four sera reacted only with the capsid antigen. The peptide test distinguished true from false positive results in agreement with recombinant immunoblot assay in 96% of blood donor samples repeatably reactive on a recombinant hepatitis C virus enzyme immunoassay.\r"

The underlying biochemical defect is unknown. We used linkage analysis to localize the gene in 12 families with the aid of polymorphic DNA markers. Close linkage was detected with three markers on distal chromosome 21. The loci BCEI and D21S154 gave the highest positive logarithm-of-odds (lod) scores of 5.49 and 4.25, respectively, at zero recombination. The third locus, D21S112, gave a lod score of 6.91 at a recombination fraction of 0.034. There was no evidence of heterogeneity. Multipoint lod scores calculated against a fixed map of the three marker loci gave a maximum four-point lod score of 10.08 at a location of the disease gene at 6.0 centimorgans distal to locus BCEI and 0.8 centimorgan proximal to locus D21S154. As markers BCEI and D21S154 have previously been localized to 21q22.3 by physical methods, our findings place the EMP1 gene locus (for progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type) in chromosome 21 band q22.3. This finding provides an opportunity to test several other epilepsy phenotypes, particularly the so-called Ramsay Hunt syndrome, for linkage to the same locus. It also is a starting point toward isolating and characterizing the gene and its protein product.\r"

Many of these thymomas are of monoclonal origin as judged by provirus integration pattern and contain rearranged genes encoding T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta chains but germ-line immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Some of the monoclonal tumors contain multiple rearranged alleles encoding TCR gamma, delta, and beta chains. Further, one Ab-MuLV thymoma cell line contained germ-line-configuration TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes, which became rearranged after in vitro propagation. Clones of this cell line were observed to rearrange these genes after intrathymic passage. Also, some subclones of this cell line underwent rearrangement of their immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in culture. These observations suggest that the thymic targets for Ab-MuLV transformation are early gamma/delta thymocytes, some of which continue to rearrange their TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes.\r"

Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.\r"

To define regulatory regions of the gene that are important for cell type-specific expression, a deletion series of the tyrosinase 5' region was fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and electroporated into tyrosinase-expressing and -nonexpressing cell lines. We show that 270 base pairs 5' of the transcriptional start site is sufficient for CAT expression in a human and a mouse melanoma cell line. This 5' flanking fragment, when cloned in the context of a tyrosinase minigene construct and injected into fertilized eggs of an albino mouse strain, is sufficient for cell type-specific expression in mice. The transgenic mice were pigmented in both skin and eyes.

Dmyd clone encodes a polypeptide of 332 amino acids with 82% identity to MyoD in the 41 amino acids of the putative helix-loop-helix region and 100% identity in the 13 amino acids of the basic domain proposed to contain the essential recognition code for muscle-specific gene activation. Low-stringency hybridizations indicate that Dmyd is not a member of a multigene family similar to MyoD in vertebrates. Dmyd is a nuclear protein in Drosophila, consistent with its role as a nuclear-gene regulatory factor, and is proposed to be a transiently expressed marker for muscle founder cells. We have used an 8-kilobase promoter fragment from the gene, which contains the first 55 amino acids of the Dmyd protein, joined to lacZ, to follow myogenic precursor cells into muscle fibers with antibodies to beta-galactosidase and to Dmyd. Unlike the myogenic factors in vertebrate muscle cells, Dmyd appears to be expressed at a much lower level in differentiated Drosophila muscles, so Dmyd cannot be followed continuously as a muscle marker. This fact is reflected in the loss of Dmyd RNA expression in 12- to 24-hr embryos, a major period of early myogenesis, as well as in the undetectable level of the nuclear antigen in primary cultures of embryonic and adult Drosophila muscle.\r"

The factor(s) binding to this sequence motif was purified by oligonucleotide-affinity chromatography. Binding of this factor appears to play a key role in determining the overall enhancer function. Additionally, the interaction of several purified factors is presented. Cotransfection of liver cells with expression vectors encoding transcriptional factors resulted in trans-activation of the promoter/enhancer function.

We have cloned the RAD6 homolog from Drosophila melanogaster and find that its encoded protein displays a very high degree of identity in amino acid sequence with the homologous RAD6 proteins from the two divergent yeasts, S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and from human. Genetic complementation studies indicate that the Drosophila RAD6 homolog can functionally substitute for the S. cerevisiae RAD6 gene in its DNA-repair and UV-mutagenesis functions but cannot substitute in sporulation. The high degree of structural and functional conservation of RAD6 in eukaryotic evolution suggests that the various protein components involved in RAD6-dependent DNA repair and mutagenesis functions have also been conserved.\r"

Circadian fluctuations in per mRNA levels are thought to contribute to circadian fluctuations in per protein levels in the heads of adult flies. To address the mechanisms underlying these oscillatory phenomena, we have analyzed RNA and protein cycling from two per-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. These studies demonstrate that 5' noncoding sequences from per are sufficient to cause the fusion mRNA levels to cycle in a wild-type (rhythmic) background. Protein cycling requires additional sequences derived from the per coding region. The data suggest that there is a per-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism that is under circadian clock control required for per protein levels to fluctuate in a rhythmic fashion.\r"

  ".W": "Human lung adenocarcinoma cells develop bipolar shape with prominent pseudopodia (greater than or equal to 200 microns) when cultured in the presence of autocrine motility factor (AMF)-like substance or on fibronectin-coated substrata. AMF was partially purified from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and has a peak biological activity at a molecular mass of 67 kDa. Using time-lapse photography, we observed that during AMF- or fibronectin-induced cell translocation, the nuclei of some bipolar cells are transported to the opposite end of the cell, while gross cell shape and position remain unchanged. Following this nuclear movement, which we call \"nucleokinesis,\" the posterior pseudopodium is retracted behind the nucleus. Thus, extension of a pseudopodium followed by nucleokinesis in the same direction and retraction of the cell body behind the nucleus is a normal motile sequence in translocating bipolar cells. This suggests that nucleokinesis is a distinct step in whole-cell translocation of bipolar cells on biological substrata and that pseudopodia can be used as nuclear transport organs. In contrast, adenocarcinoma cells cultured on artificial substrata and in the absence of AMF display a fibroblast-like motility pattern with the nucleus centrally located within the migrating cell.\r"

Both adult and fetal human RPE cells contain mRNA for multiple G protein alpha subunits (G alpha) including Gs alpha, Gi-1 alpha, Gi-2 alpha, Gi-3 alpha, and Gz alpha (or Gx alpha), where Gs and Gi are proteins that stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase, respectively, and Gz is a protein that may mediate pertussis toxin-insensitive events. Other G alpha-related mRNA transcripts were detected in fetal RPE cells by low-stringency hybridization to Gi-2 alpha and Gs alpha protein-coding cDNA probes. The diversity of G proteins in RPE cells was further studied by cDNA amplification with reverse transcriptase and the polymerase chain reaction. This approach revealed that, besides the above mentioned members of the G alpha gene family, at least two other G alpha subunits are expressed in RPE cells. Human retinal cDNA clones that encode one of the additional G alpha subunits were isolated and characterized. The results indicate that this G alpha subunit belongs to a separate subfamily of G proteins that may be insensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin.\r"

Mouse S49 cells were infected with adenovirus variants expressing either the 243- or 289-amino acid E1A protein and treated with the cAMP analog dibutyryl-cAMP. Significant E1A-dependent induction of c-fos mRNA and AP-1-binding activity was observed in cells expressing either E1A protein. These effects absolutely required the presence of cAMP. In contrast, the 243-amino acid protein was a poor activator of the viral early genes E2 and E4 compared with the 289-amino acid protein. These data suggest that the 243- and 289-amino acid E1A proteins both interact functionally with the cAMP signaling system to activate transcription of a cellular gene and AP-1-binding activity. The mechanism involved in this process is probably different from the mechanism of transcriptional activation of viral genes.\r"

  ".U": "91219494\r", 
  ".W": "We have used the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) as a reporter gene for the rapid measurement of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of individual T cells. The reporter construct contained the lacZ gene under the control of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) element of the human interleukin 2 enhancer [Fiering, S., Northrop, J. P., Nolan, G. P., Matilla, P., Crabtree, G. R. & Herzenberg, L. A. (1990) Genes Dev. 4, 1823-1834]. The activity of the intracellular lacZ enzyme was analyzed by flow cytometric measurement of fluorescein accumulation in cells loaded with the fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate fluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside. As a model system, the T-cell hybridoma BO4H9.1, which is specific for the lysozyme peptide (amino acids 74-88)/Ab complex, was transfected with the NF-AT-lacZ construct. lacZ activity was induced in 50-100% of the transfectant cells following exposure to pharmacological agents, to the physiological peptide/major histocompatibility complex ligand, or to other TCR-specific stimuli. Interestingly, increasing concentrations of the stimulus increased the fraction of lacZ+ cells, but not the level of lacZ activity per cell. Even under widely varying levels of stimulus, the level of lacZ activity in individual lacZ+ cells remained within a remarkably narrow range. These results demonstrate that TCR-mediated activation can be readily measured in single T cells and strongly suggest that, once committed to activation, the level of NF-AT transcriptional activity in individual T cells is independent of the form or concentration of stimulus. This assay is likely to prove useful for the study of early activation events in individual T cells and of TCR ligands.\r"

Mice expressing high levels of either p56lckF505 or p56lckY505 reproducibly developed thymic tumors.

This method is based on the selection of RNA sequences, exons, which are flanked by functional 5' and 3' splice sites. Fragments of cloned genomic DNA are inserted into an intron, which is flanked by 5' and 3' splice sites of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 tat gene contained within the plasmid pSPL1. COS-7 cells are transfected with these constructs, and the resulting RNA transcripts are processed in vivo. Splice sites of exons contained within the inserted genomic fragment are paired with splice sites of the flanking tat intron. The resulting mature RNA contains the previously unidentified exons, which can then be amplified via RNA-based PCR and cloned. Using this method, we have isolated exon sequences from cloned genomic fragments of the murine Na,K-ATPase alpha 1-subunit gene. We have also screened randomly selected genomic clones known to be derived from a segment of human chromosome 19 and have isolated exon sequences of the DNA repair gene ERCC1. The sensitivity and ease of the exon amplification method permit screening of 20-40 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA in a single transfection. This approach will be extremely useful for rapid identification of mammalian exons and the genes from which they are derived as well as for the generation of chromosomal transcription maps.\r"

The longest cDNA insert was 837 base pairs long and contained a coding region of 570 base pairs corresponding to 190 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 21,016. Between two cDNA inserts isolated from the two different libraries, nucleotide substitutions were observed at 16 positions, including conservative amino acid substitutions at 2 positions and nonconservative substitutions at 5 positions, indicating genetic heterogeneity of this enzyme in humans. The computer-assisted homology search revealed that the enzyme is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, comprising secretory hydrophobic molecule transporters, showing the greatest homology (28.8-29.4% identity; 51.3-53.1% similarity) to alpha 1-microglobulin among the members of this superfamily. In a phylogenetic tree of the superfamily, this enzyme, alpha 1-microglobulin, and the gamma chain of the complement component C8 form a cluster separate from the other 14 members. The two distinctive characteristics of glutathione-independent prostaglandin D synthase, as compared to the other members of this superfamily, are its enzymatic properties and its association with membranes that were probably acquired after evolutionary divergence of the two lipocalins. Based on the observed sequence homology, the tertiary structure of the enzyme was deduced to consist of an eight-stranded anti-parallel beta-barrel forming a hydrophobic pocket. Furthermore, the Cys-65 residue in the pocket, which is conserved only in the human and rat enzymes but not in other lipocalins, was considered to be a putative active site of the enzyme.\r"

The level of tau mRNA was only slightly changed postnatally in the cerebral hemispheres of hypothyroid rats, whereas the level of tau mRNA in the cerebellum was maintained at a higher level than in the euthyroid controls. As shown by in situ hybridization studies, such an alteration in tau mRNA expression can be ascribed to an effect of thyroid hormone on the rate of migration of the granule cells in the cerebellum; that tau mRNAs remain high in the cerebellum as long as the granule cells are migrating correlates with the observation that hypothyroidism slows the rate of migration of granule cells. RNase protection assays also showed that thyroid hormone deficiency delays the transition between the immature and mature tau transcripts in both brain regions. Thus, one of the effects of thyroid hormone is to regulate the splicing mechanism that allows replacement of the juvenile tau variants by the adult entities during neuronal differentiation.\r"

We assessed permeability by tissue uptake of radiolabeled aminoisobutyric acid, after correcting for plasma counts in tissue with radiolabeled inulin. Among 14 regions examined, the transfer coefficient of aminoisobutyric acid in nonischemic control animals ranged from 0.0018 +/- 0.0001 ml/g/min in diencephalon to 0.0049 +/- 0.0003 ml/g/min in cervical spinal cord. After 8 minutes of cardiac arrest followed by either 10 or 40 minutes of continuous sternal compression, there was no increase in the transfer coefficient. Likewise, during the immediate period after ventricular defibrillation, there was no increase in transfer coefficient despite the brief, transient hypertension. However, after 8 minutes of arrest, 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and 4 hours of spontaneous circulation, the transfer coefficient was significantly increased by 59-107% in 10 of 11 regions rostral to the pons. Plasma volume in tissue measured by inulin was not elevated, suggesting that the increased transfer coefficient was not due to increased surface area. Thus, after an 8-minute period of complete ischemia, the blood-brain barrier remains intact during and immediately after resuscitation despite large vascular pressure fluctuations. However, in contrast to previous work on adult dogs, immature pigs are prone to a delayed increase in permeability, thereby allowing circulating substances greater access to the brain.\r"

Fresh, autologous blood (n = 15) or cerebrospinal fluid (n = 14) was placed under the dura mater over the parietal cortex, and the piglets were allowed to recover from anesthesia. One to four days later, a closed cranial window was placed over the parietal cortex and pial arteriolar responses to arterial hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 55 mm Hg), hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure less than 35 mm Hg), or topical application of 10(-6) and 10(-4) M isoproterenol were determined. Pial arterioles in the cerebrospinal fluid group dilated 27 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) (n = 11) in response to hypercapnia, 26 +/- 5% (n = 9) in response to hypotension, and 26 +/- 3% in response to 10(-6) M and 40 +/- 4% in response to 10(-4) M isoproterenol (n = 11). In the group in which blood was placed on the parietal cortex, pial arterioles did not dilate significantly in response to hypercapnia (8 +/- 3%, n = 11) or hypotension (2 +/- 5%, n = 13) but dilated normally in response to isoproterenol (25 +/- 5% in response to 10(-6) M and 36 +/- 7% in response to 10(-4) M, n = 13). We conclude that prolonged contact of pial arterioles with extravascular blood selectively attenuates cerebrovascular dilation in piglets.\r"

The data were compared to saline-treated diabetic rats and saline-treated nondiabetic littermates. The volume and duration of the treatment infusion were similar in all groups. Insulin infusion in diabetic rats produced the expected reduction in blood and plasma glucose, and normoglycemia was produced within 78 +/- 37 minutes (mean +/- SD). However, once normoglycemia was achieved, brain glucose was still significantly greater by 44% than in nondiabetic rats (p = 0.015). Moreover, the ratio of brain to plasma glucose was more than 50% greater in diabetic than nondiabetic rats, irrespective of whether or not they received insulin (p less than 0.01). We conclude that measurement of blood or plasma glucose in diabetic subjects will tend to underestimate the amount of glucose in the brain and that this relationship is not influenced by acute insulin therapy.\r"

Current data originate mainly from in vitro experiments, as in vivo studies of larger intracranial cerebral arteries have been cumbersome so far due to the lack of a suitable animal model. We provide a detailed technical description of a closed transclival window method for in vivo study of the basilar artery in cats. We present our experience with this preparation in 29 animals, which shows that the technique is feasible and allows repeated, accurate, and reproducible measurements of the basilar artery, although possible depressive effects of the anesthesia on vascular reactivity have to be taken into account. With hyperventilation, the basilar artery constricted by 12.2 +/- 7.6% of the baseline diameter. The cerebral blood flow response to hypocapnia with this preparation was 2.0 +/- 0.4%/torr PaCO2. An exudative clouding of the window occurred in some cats but had no apparent effect on vascular reactivity. We also discuss possible pitfalls in the surgical preparation.\r"

The pharmacology of endothelium-derived nitric oxide is virtually identical to that of the clinically used nitrovasodilators. Although endothelium-derived relaxing factor or endothelium-derived nitric oxide seems to be important in animals, its significance in humans still needs to be shown. We review the recent discoveries in the identification, biosynthesis, metabolism, and biologic actions of endothelium-derived nitric oxide, its significance in humans, and its relation to the clinically used nitrovasodilators.\r"

It is influenced by heart rate, loading conditions, sympathetic nervous system activity, ejection fraction and other factors. To determine the effect of altered loading conditions on peak filling rate, independent of heart rate and sympathetic nervous system activity, 12 patients were studied 3 weeks after orthotopic heart transplantation. Plasma catecholamine level, heart rate and ejection fraction were not changed by any maneuver. Nitroglycerin caused a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure (9 +/- 2 to 6 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and in absolute peak filling rate (46.0 +/- 3.0 to 42.8 +/- 2.5 kcts/s, p less than 0.01), but no change in normalized peak filling rate. Volume infusion increased pulmonary artery wedge pressure (9 +/- 2 to 12 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and absolute peak filling rate (46.0 +/- 3.0 to 51.5 +/- 5.3 kcts/s, p less than 0.01), but peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume was unchanged. During nitroglycerin and volume infusions, there was a high correlation between changes in pulmonary artery wedge pressure and absolute peak filling rate (r = 0.82, p less than 0.001). With normalization of peak filling rate, these variables correlated less well. With methoxamine, 4 patients demonstrating systolic dysfunction had a decrease in absolute and normalized peak filling rate despite a large increase in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. The other 8 patients without systolic dysfunction had an increase in pulmonary artery wedge pressure with increased absolute but unchanged normalized peak filling rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The authors describe a 24-year-old women with Noonan's syndrome, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and a platelet function defect characterized by a greater than 15-minute bleeding time, failure of aggregation and release with 10 microM ADP, 10 microM epinephrine, 750 microM arachidonic acid or 0.019 g/L collagen. A mixture of aspirin-treated platelets with the patient's platelets failed to correct the defect. Addition of 2.5 microM U46619 (a PGG2 analogue) corrected the aggregation and release defect. An electron microscopic analysis failed to reveal structural abnormalities. Thus, the platelet function defect in this patient appears to be a functional deficiency of cyclooxygenase. The presence of autoantiplatelet antibodies in a clinical setting consistent with chronic ITP raises the possibility that the defect may be acquired.\r"

Extrapolation of the data to a workload of slightly more than 1.1 million tests showed that reapportionment of tests to various batch sizes caused Paramax-Ektachem labor cost differences to fluctuate between $37,254 and $34,995. When the minimum usable walk-away interval length was varied from 1 to 20 minutes, Ektachem savings over Paramax increased from $8,700 to $61,400. The WRM predicted a constant $29,050 labor cost advantage for Ektachem over Paramax. If other instruments show similar labor use characteristics with respect to batch size and walk-away utility, laboratory managers who do not consider these factors may fail to select the most cost-effective instruments for their laboratories.\r"

It is unknown whether dialysis therapy may influence PMN carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, PMNs were isolated from healthy control subjects, patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and patients undergoing regular hemodialysis therapy (RDT) before, during, and at the end of hemodialysis (HD) treatment using dialyzers made of polysulfone or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Nifedipine (NIF) was continuously infused during HD with PMMA in 5 patients at a dose of 18 micrograms/kg body weight per hour. Glycogen, activity of glycogen synthetase and phosphorylase (active and inactive forms of both enzymes), and glucose uptake with and without stimulation with the chemotactic peptide FMLP were determined in these PMNs. During HD with PMMA, there was a significant increase of PMN phosphorylase \"a\" activity 15 and 30 minutes after the start of HD. HD with polysulfone did not stimulate the active \"a\" form of the glycogen-degrading enzyme in PMNs. HD with PMMA significantly inhibited the active I-form of glycogen synthetase, whereas polysulfone activated glycogen synthetase I. NIF inhibited phosphorylase \"a\" activation during HD with PMMA. PMN glycogen content and glucose uptake were improved during HD with polysulfone, but not with PMMA. PMN glycogen content, activity of glycogen synthetase, and glucose uptake were significantly lower also in CAPD patients compared with healthy controls. These data show that HD with PMMA activates PMN glycogenolysis. This effect can be inhibited by calcium channel blockers. PMN glycogen content of RDT and CAPD patients is significantly lower compared with healthy controls due to inhibition of glycogen synthesis. Elimination of dialyzable factor(s) improves, but does not restore, PMN glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake.\r"

All specimens also contained u-PAR mRNA in cells located at the tumoral-stromal interface of invasive foci, but in contrast at least some of these cells were in all but one case identified as being of malignant origin. Stromal cells, probably tumor-infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils, also were positive in these areas. These results support the view that components of the plasminogen activation system may act to influence proteolytic events occurring at the interface between stroma and malignant cells in adenocarcinomas of the colon in humans.\r"

Having determined intra- and extracellular PA and PA-inhibitor activities in an experimental pancreatic ascites tumor grown in hamsters, the release of PA from these cells was investigated. No PA activity was detected in the suspension medium of freshly isolated tumor cells; inclusion of plasminogen, fibrinogen, or collagen in the medium yielded similar negative results. On the other hand, PA activity was demonstrated to be released in a time-dependent manner from these tumor cells embedded in fibrin clots. Plasminogen activator activity also was not found in the suspension medium of frozen-thawed tumor cells, despite the fact that most of them had breaks on their cell membrane. Unlike freshly isolated tumor cells, PA was not released from frozen-thawed cells embedded in fibrin clots. Full PA activity was demonstrated in frozen-thawed cells treated with Triton X-100, however. Frozen-thawed cells exhibited signs of severe damage, and more than 80% of them failed to exclude trypan blue. Obviously PA is released from viable tumor cells embedded in fibrin clots but not suspended in artificial medium. The PA-release mechanism, not PA itself, is destroyed in cells rendered nonviable by freeze thawing.\r"

All transgenic mice develop bilateral intraocular retinal tumors in the inner nuclear layer with Homer Wright-like rosettes, and one quarter develop midbrain tumors resembling trilateral retinoblastoma. Cell lines TE-1 and TM-1 were established from intraocular and metastatic tumors, respectively. Intraocular tumors reacted with antibodies to neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, while vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic, and S-100 proteins were detected only in reactive glia derived from adjacent retina. The midbrain tumors showed weak reactivity to synaptophysin, and they blended with reactive astrocytes positive for glial markers. The tumors were negative for cytokeratins. Finally both derived cell lines expressed synaptophysin and individual neurofilament triplet proteins in immunofluorescence and Western blotting, supporting their essentially neuronal nature. The antigenic profile resembles human retinoblastoma, but differences in morphology and antigen distribution suggest a more close relationship to neurons of the inner nuclear layer than to photoreceptor cells.\r"

Immunostaining of the islets with monoclonal antibody OX4 for demonstration of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-expressing cells revealed a decrease from 13.1 +/- 0.6 positive cells per islet on day 0 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 cells per islet on day 7. A comparable decrease was found using OX1 for demonstration of all leukocytes. In contrast, culture of rat islets at 24 degrees C for 7 days with tissue culture Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium was not as effective in eliminating lymphoid cells as in medium CMRL 1066 (3.0 +/- 0.2 class II MHC positive cells per islet at 7 days). Effective elimination of intraislet lymphoid cells apparently is due to the combined effect of low temperature culture and the tissue culture medium CMRL-1066. The second goal of the study was to determine whether the destructive effect of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on rat islets in culture was due to intraislet lymphoid cells. In vitro culture of rat islets with IFN-gamma (1000 units/ml) at 37 degrees C caused almost complete destruction of the islets at 7 days. If intraislet lymphoid cells were eliminated from the islets by in vitro culture at 24 degrees C followed by exposure to IFN-gamma (1000 units/ml) for 7 days at 37 degrees C, then IFN-gamma did not cause destruction of the islets and transplants of the treated islets produced normoglycemia in diabetic recipient mice. These findings indicate that intraislet lymphoid cells are responsible for destruction of islet cells when these cells (presumably macrophages) are activated by IFN-gamma. Intraislet lymphoid cells may play a significant role in destroying islet cells in autoimmune diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of primary cultures established from human thyroid nodular and normal (paranodular) tissues resulted in induction of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR expression on thyroid follicular cells (TFC), as detected by cell-surface immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies (MAb). Two distinct modalities of induction were observed. The first type occurred in cultures of normal tissue obtained from CMV-seropositive but not seronegative donors, was detected on 30% to 50% of the TFCs, even though the vast majority of these cells failed to show any morphologic or antigenic evidence of individual CMV infection, and was associated with production of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) in vitro. The induced molecules displayed the characteristic DR polypeptide profile on immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic analysis. These results demonstrate that CMV infection of normal thyroid cultures may induce DR expression on TFCs in the absence of pre-existing lymphoid infiltrates and suggest that the induction is the result of an in vitro response to CMV by previously sensitized immunocompetent cells present in these primary cultures. Such a response, associated with the release of gamma-IFN, would induce DR expression on neighboring uninfected cells. The second mode of induction occurred in all CMV-infected cultures, regardless of their tissue origin (nodular or normal) or the serologic status of the donors. Up to 50% of infected TFCs at a late stage of infection, having fully developed CMV antigen-positive intranuclear inclusions, also displayed the cell-surface DR-related determinant recognized by one of the four anti-DR MAbs used. This induction was restricted to TFCs, while CMV-infected fibroblastoid cells present in the monolayers were invariably negative. Induction by CMV of major histocompatibility class II antigens on human epithelial cells may have significant implications in the development of normal immune responses against local viral infection, the enhancement of alloimmune rejection of grafted organs, and the generation of organ-specific autoimmune responses.\r"

DESIGN: An in vitro laboratory study. SETTING: Hospital laboratory. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Arterial blood from five stable patients residing in a tertiary hospital ICU. Venous blood samples obtained from five healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Two-mL aliquots from each blood sample were placed into four test tubes and mixed with phosphate buffer. Cyanide was added to three of the tubes so that the four tubes contained 0, 6, 12, and 25 mg/L cyanide. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The percent saturation gap was calculated by subtracting the percent oxyhemoglobin measured on an oximeter from the percent saturation calculated by a blood gas analyzer. Using two-tailed, paired t tests, we could not demonstrate a difference in mean percent saturation gaps between arterial samples or venous samples with and without cyanide. All blood samples had a normal percent saturation gap (P greater than .99 by Fisher's exact test). We had greater than a 95% chance of demonstrating a difference in mean percent saturation gaps of only 0.46% in arterial blood and of 3.3% in venous blood if such a difference existed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, as well as a review of the literature, indicate that there are no data supporting the suggestion that a percent saturation gap should imply the diagnosis of poisoning by inorganic cyanide.\r"

After an accidental ingestion of 3 mg misoprostol (approximately 15 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose), a 71-year-old woman exhibited fever, tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, and abdominal cramping. Recovery ensued with standard supportive care. The physiology of this unique drug and implications for management of acute toxicity are summarized.\r"

This study focused on exudation of plasma into the airway luman (circumventing problems with a changing blood pool in tissue samples). Topical tracheal superfusions with a neurogenic agent (capsalcin), bradykinin, and histamine increased mucosal blood flow (Laser Doppler flowmetry) and produced significant exudation of macromolecular plasma tracers (fluorescein-labeled dextran 156000 D; 131I-albumin 70,000 D). Lidocaine 3 x 10(-5) M, applied topically, inhibited capsalcin- but not bradykinin-induced plasma exudation. Intravenously administered terbutaline, enprofylline, and theophylline and topical cromoglycate dose-dependently inhibited the inflammatory stimuli-induced mucosal exudation of plasma. Cromoglycate did not alter airway blood flow, and both terbutaline and enprofylline increased the blood flow. Hence, these three types of drugs did not inhibit exudation by stopping flow. Further, both neural and non-neural exudative responses were inhibited, suggesting that the drugs may have acted directly on the permeability-regulating microvascular endothelial cells. It is proposed that antiexudative actions may contribute to the antiasthma effects of beta 2-agonists, xanthines, and cromoglycates.\r"

The results showed that cells from patients with COPD were significantly less effective than cells from control subjects in the killing of C. albicans. To explore whether the observed functional impairment could be reversed, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was added to AM and PBM from patients with COPD, alone or in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a suboptimal stimulus. The cells were cultured for 24 h and then assayed for anti-Candida activity. After IFN-gamma treatment, the fungicidal activity of cells from patients with COPD was comparable to that of unstimulated AM or PBM from healthy donors. Treatment with IFN-gamma plus LPS resulted in a further enhancement in the killing of C. albicans. To gain more insight into the mechanisms involved in the modulation of killing, we evaluated the possible stimulating activity of IFN-gamma plus LPS treatment on the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), two cytokines produced by activated macrophages and capable of stimulating natural effectors. The results showed that IFN-gamma plus LPS can indeed stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion by AM and PBM from patients with COPD. Therefore, a precise role can reasonably be ascribed to these soluble factors in the observed augmentation of candidacidal activity as ascertained by treatment with IFN-gamma plus LPS.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of the observation that serum levels of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are elevated in pancreatitis and systemic sepsis, and the association of these conditions with the subsequent development of acute lung injury, the present investigation examined the structural and physiologic consequences of intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult male rats. Rats received direct intratracheal instillation of either control vehicle or 40,000 units/kg of PLA2 repurified from Naja naja venom. Animals treated with PLA2 showed higher cumulative mortality (33% versus 0%, n = 79; p less than 0.01) than did their control littermates. The PLA2-treated animals showed histologic evidence of acute lung injury characterized by interstitial and alveolar edema, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and alveolar wall thickening, which reached maximal severity 48 h after enzyme instillation. Forty-eight hours after PLA2 administration experimental animals had lower arterial oxygen tensions (73.9 +/- 7.66 mm Hg versus 96.7 +/- 2.52 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), higher alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (35.3 +/- 6.3 mm Hg versus 18.8 +/- 1.42 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and higher wet-dry lung weight ratios (5.08 +/- 0.26, mean +/- SEM, n = 7 versus 3.29 +/- 0.08, n = 3; p less than 0.002) than did control animals. Lung lavage from experimental animals 48 h after PLA2 instillation showed increased total cell counts [(26.6 +/- 5.04) x 10(6) cells versus (4.69 +/- 1.48) x 10(6) cells; p less than 0.01], an increased percentage of neutrophils (34.2 +/- 4.6% versus 1.25 +/- 0.25%, mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.01), and increased protein concentrations in lavage fluid (0.38 +/- 0.06 mg/ml, mean +/- SEM, n = 4 versus 0.27 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, n = 5; p less than 0.05). The histologic and physiologic abnormalities had largely resolved by 240 h. These results suggest that PLA2 may be a potent mediator of lung inflammation and that intratracheal administration of PLA2 to adult rats may provide a useful experimental model of acute lung injury.\r"

Compared with saline-inoculated ears, significant increases in the mean concentrations of all four metabolites were observed in the pneumococcus-inoculated ears 24 hours after inoculation, but not after 6, 48, or 72 hours. Since pneumococcus inoculation caused an influx of inflammatory cells as early as 6 hours after inoculation, before the increase in arachidonate metabolites, the initial stimulus for inflammatory cell chemotaxis is probably not metabolic products of arachidonic acid such as leukotriene B4. These metabolites may, however, amplify the subsequent inflammatory response.\r"
