  ".W": "The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of blunt cardiac trauma on the epicardial coronary arteries of dogs by using sequential coronary arteriographic studies. A direct impact to the anterior surface of the heart at a velocity of 12 m/sec was delivered by an air pressurized impactor in eight of ten dogs with the chest open and the pericardium intact. Selective coronary arteriograms were performed percutaneously with the chest closed starting just before trauma and repeated afterward at intervals of 3 hours, 3 days, 2 weeks, and 5 weeks. Two of ten dogs were sham operated and did not undergo impact to the heart. The coronary arteries in these two dogs remained angiographically normal throughout the study period. In dogs that underwent impact and were maintained for the entire duration of the study (seven of eight dogs), injury to the epicardial coronary arteries occurred in every instance. Injury was limited mostly to branches of the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries. The left circumflex coronary artery, which was posterior to the site of impact, was always spared. The types of injury included complete branch occlusion, partial coronary obstruction, extravasation, and in one instance, an arteriovenous fistula. In nearly all instances, these injuries became evident angiographically between 3 hours and 3 days after impact and usually were completely resolved after 2 to 5 weeks. These observations indicate that the epicardial coronary arteries may be compromised by nonpenetrating cardiac impact. The resulting coronary pathology, however, resolved within a few weeks after injury.\r"

We report a technique, previously used in animals, that combines conductance catheter volumes and rapid inferior vena caval occlusion to permit routine measurement of calibrated P-V relationships in man for the first time. An 8F volume catheter with a 3F micromanometer tipped pressure catheter placed through its lumen was advanced to the left ventricular apex through a femoral artery. A thermodilution output catheter was placed through a 9F femoral venous sheath and later replaced with an IVC balloon occlusion catheter, through which a 2.5F bipolar wire was advanced for atrial pacing. A specialized data system facilitated collection, editing, and data analysis at the time of cardiac catheterization. Absolute volume calibration required cardiac output measurement and injection of hypertonic saline. IVC occlusion decreased peak left ventricular pressure by 42 +/- 17 (SD) (P less than .001) mm Hg in 15 patients. Endsystolic pressure-volume relationships (ESPVR) were determined with 5-8 cardiac cycles with an average of r2 of 0.94 +/- 0.05 and were generally reproducible. The slope of the ESPVR demonstrated consistency among a group of normal patients (n = 6), and was significantly lower than the slope derived from a group of patients with ventricular hypertrophy (n = 9). We conclude that left ventricular pressure-volume relationships can be easily and repeatedly determined as part of a routine cardiac catheterization in man.\r"

The TFC is the ratio of the output to input acceleration amplitudes. The instantaneous TFC was characterized as a single-peaked configuration under control coronary perfusion. However, TFCs progressively changed from a single-peaked to a double-peaked configuration during regional ischemia. To quantify this change in instantaneous TFC, we defined an index D as the mean squared difference of TFC during ischemia from TFC during control. Index D was linearly related to the percent mass of the ischemic region at 40 minutes after onset of ischemia. We conclude that 1) transfer function curves are sensitive measures of myocardial heterogeneity and 2) the fractional ischemic weight of the ventricle is a major factor in determination of the deformation in instantaneous TFC at the later stages of regional ischemia.\r"

Data for this analysis were obtained from six dogs at rest and during moderate treadmill exercise (8% grade, 4.5 miles/hr). Volume distensibility reflects the regional rheological properties of the UDTA at in vivo states. It was shown to be the sum of circumferential extensibility, longitudinal extensibility, and higher-order extensibilities. Circumferential extensibility and longitudinal extensibility are linear expressions of vessel kinematic changes which represent percent volume changes per pulse pressure and are due to circumferential and longitudinal dimensional changes alone. The higher-order extensibilities (second and third order), however, account for the coupling effect, which is the percentage volume change per millimeter mercury pulse pressure due to the interactions among radial, circumferential, and axial dimensional changes. The volume distensibility of the UDTA during exercise was significantly less than that at rest (0.67 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.11% V/mm Hg pressure). This was the result of a significant decrease in circumferential extensibility and higher-order extensibility in response to exercise with no change in longitudinal extensibility. The higher order extensibilities were also important since the volume distensibility of the UDTA was underestimated by 10% for both rest and exercise when they were ignored. We also evaluated radial extensibility by using pressure and wall thickness data and showed that this variable did not change in response to exercise.\r"

The iliac artery was ligated on one side in cynomolgus monkeys. Sixteen months later, we recorded the pressure gradient across the limb collaterals and measured blood flow with microspheres. Collateral conductance was fivefold greater after chronic ligation of the iliac artery than after acute ligation. Despite dilatation or growth of collateral vessels after chronic ligation, iliac pressure was reduced distal to the ligation. Blood flow to the limb was normal after chronic ligation in both normal and atherosclerotic monkeys. Collateral vessels constricted in response to infusion of phenylephrine and serotonin in normal and atherosclerotic monkeys. Thus, one conclusion of this study is that collateral vessels restore limb blood flow to normal after chronic vascular occlusion in both normal and atherosclerotic monkeys, but the protective effects of collateral vessels may be compromised by vasoconstrictor stimuli. Morphometric measurements indicated that occlusion of the iliac artery reduced proliferation of atherosclerotic intima distal to the occlusion in the cholesterol-fed monkeys. Thus, a second conclusion of this study is that atherosclerosis is attenuated below an arterial occlusion.\r"

In this study, we determined the effects of a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I inhibitor, ethyl 2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (Etomoxir) on reperfusion recovery of fatty acid perfused hearts. Following a 25-minute period of global ischemia, isolated working hearts reperfused with 1.2 mM palmitate, 11 mM glucose exhibited depressed function compared to hearts perfused with 11 mM glucose alone. A low dose of Etomoxir (10(-9) M) decreased long chain acylcarnitine and long chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) levels but did not prevent depressed function. In contrast, a high dose of Etomoxir (10(-6) M) prevented the palmitate-induced depression of function but did not decrease myocardial long chain acylcarnitine or long chain acyl-CoA levels. At this high dose of Etomoxir, oxygen consumption per unit work was decreased during reperfusion recovery, and ATP and creatine-phosphate levels were significantly higher after reperfusion. In aerobic hearts not subjected to ischemia, Etomoxir (10(-6) M) increased glucose oxidation both in the presence and absence of palmitate, while 10(-9) M Etomoxir had no effect. In these aerobic hearts, only the low dose of Etomoxir decreased long chain acylcarnitine and long chain acyl-CoA levels. These data demonstrate that Etomoxir (10(-6) M) increases functional recovery of fatty acid perfused ischemic hearts. This protection is unrelated to changes in levels of long chain acylcarnitines but may be due to increased glucose use by the reperfused heart, resulting in decreased oxygen consumption per unit work.\r"

In this study, we hypothesized that leukocytes normally resident to the myocardium also contribute to myocardial injury in the absence of migration and accumulation of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In isolated crystalloid-perfused rat hearts, we found numerous resident cardiac leukocytes that were identified primarily as macrophages and mast cells, the latter staining avidly for peroxidase. When hypoxic perfused hearts (60 minutes, n = 16) were reoxygenated there was a prompt release of this peroxidase activity, the extent of which correlated closely with the degree of myocardial injury (total creatine kinase release, r = 0.96). When reoxygenation associated mast cell degranulation was prevented in six additional hypoxic hearts using 10 microM Lodoxamide Tromethamine, peroxidase release was reduced 7.8-fold (p less than 0.001) and creatine kinase release (injury) was reduced 5.9-fold (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that the isolated crystalloid-perfused rat heart is not a leukocyte-free preparation and suggest that mast cells resident to the heart play an important role in acute reoxygenation injury.\r"

With the aid of an optical multichannel analyzer, we recorded in real time fluorescence spectra during excitation of the arterial surface with an argon ion laser. Spectral parameters were used to detect atherosclerotic plaques and to discriminate normal tissue from lipid rich and calcified atheromas. By digitizing relative intensity values and the ratios of the peak at 550 nm to that at 520 nm into a gray scale, we generated pseudocolor maps of the arterial wall of 10 human aortas. Specific color distributions were congruent with the distribution of calcified tissue visualized by soft x-ray radiography and the distribution of lipid delineated by staining with Sudan IV. Thus, bidimensional maps obtained by laser spectroscopy can be used to identify the presence and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Fluorescence imaging may prove to be an important application of laser techniques for the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiac contractile abnormalities induced by hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are caused by changes in intracellular Ca2+ handling or by alterations in the distribution of isoenzymes of ventricular myosin. Right ventricular papillary muscles obtained from euthyroid ferrets and ferrets treated with L-thyroxine (hyperthyroid) or methimazole (hypothyroid) were loaded with the calcium indicator aequorin for recording intracellular Ca2+ levels during isometric contraction. In muscles from the hypothyroid ferrets, peak tension was reduced and the duration of contraction prolonged compared to the controls; these changes were associated with a Ca2+ transient of decreased amplitude and prolonged duration. Hyperthyroidism produced opposite changes in the time course of the Ca2+ transient and the associated isometric contraction. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on myosin extracted from the right ventricular free wall of control and treated ferrets. The hyperthyroid state was associated with new myosin formation as indicated by the appearance of three myosin bands on the pyrophosphate gel. Gels of myosin from hypothyroid and euthyroid ferrets showed a single band that migrated with the slowest of the three bands from the hyperthyroid ferrets. These results suggest that changes in both Ca2+ handling and myosin isoenzymes may contribute to the contractile abnormalities observed in hyperthyroidism. Alterations in intracellular Ca2+ handling alone may account for the contractile changes induced by hypothyroidism.\r"

In two different study series (study 1, postpubertal; study 2, prepubertal), SHRSP were gonadectomized (HG), gonadectomized and replaced with dihydrotestosterone (HG-T), and sham-operated (H). Blood pressure was significantly higher in HG-T animals in both study series. Only prepubertal gonadectomy (study 2, HG group) led to a significantly decreased blood pressure. Heart weight and body weight were significantly diminished in the HG group when compared to the H group in study 2. Dihydrotestosterone (HG-T group) reversed this effect. In both study series gonadectomy shifted the myosin isoenzyme pattern to the V3 form while testosterone replacement led to a myosin isoenzyme pattern in favor of the V1 form. We conclude that the ventricular myosin isoenzyme pattern is under the dominant control of androgens and dissociates the expression of myosin isoenzyme from both blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Different holding potentials were used to separate total cell current into its transient (T) and sustained or long-lasting (L) components. In recordings from 30 WKY and 30 SHR vascular cells, total cell calcium current was the same between cells from normotensive (167 +/- 20 pA) and hypertensive (139 +/- 15 pA) rats. However, the relative proportion of T and L calcium currents was different between WKY and SHR cells. In WKY cells, the peak amplitude of the L current was less than that of the T current (42 +/- 30% of total current), whereas in SHR cells, the L current was greater (62 +/- 3% of total current). Calcium currents in vascular muscle cells from SHR were activated and inactivated at more positive potentials than in cells from WKY. This study directly compares transmembrane calcium current in isolated cells from WKY and SHR blood vessels and shows that the proportions of T and L calcium channels activated by depolarization are altered in this genetic model of hypertension.\r"

The present study measured circulating levels of immunoreactive bradykinin in a clinical model of acute inflammation (oral surgery) and chronic inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis) and in the rat carrageenan model of inflammation. The effects of a kallikrein inhibitor (soybean trypsin inhibitor) on blocking bradykinin synthesis in vitro and its analgesic actions in the rat model were also evaluated. Levels of immunoreactive bradykinin increased threefold to fourfold during oral surgery. Levels were twofold to threefold greater in patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with control subjects. Levels of immunoreactive bradykinin increased twofold in rats during carrageenan inflammation. Soybean trypsin inhibitor blocked synthesis of bradykinin in vitro and possessed analgesic activity in rats. The results indicate that the bradykinin system is activated during inflammation. Kallikrein inhibitors may represent a new class of analgesic/antiinflammatory drugs.\r"

We have developed such a system and applied it to the analysis of one medical school curriculum. Pharmacology and therapeutics teaching represents 22% of the curriculum; however, the majority occurs outside the pharmacology-controlled courses. Overlap is extensive and unplanned. Our data indicate that the true curriculum differs greatly from that in curriculum schedules and probably from that in the minds of most curriculum planners and teachers. Collaboration among pharmacologists and clinical pharmacologists and many other curriculum officers and teachers is essential if education in this area is to be improved.\r"

The beta 2 activity of ritodrine produces the relaxation of smooth muscles and is believed to act directly on the beta 2-receptors of the myometrium. Reports in the literature suggest that ritodrine is inactivated by sulfate and glucuronide conjugation, but this has not been verified in humans. Studies on animal models indicate that the sulfate conjugate is a major urinary metabolite of ritodrine. Recent investigations of maternal and neonatal urinary excretion of ritodrine indicate that 80% to 90% of the drug is in the form of conjugates. The purpose of this study was to determine the nature of these conjugates. Our study indicates that both the mother and neonate excrete glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of ritodrine. The sulfate conjugate accounts for 45% of maternal excretion and 66% of neonatal excretion; the glucuronide conjugate accounts for 38% and 23% of maternal and neonatal excretion, respectively. Significantly different metabolic profiles suggest that the neonate may be capable of forming conjugated metabolites of ritodrine.\r"

A drug with a high extraction ratio, lidocaine, and a drug with a low extraction ratio, theophylline, were administered to 27 patients with cirrhosis and 16 control subjects. We found a significant impairment of both theophylline clearance (p less than 0.001) and lidocaine clearance (p less than 0.001) and an increase in the lidocaine peak concentration (p less than 0.001). The three parameters were significantly correlated with each other. The impairment of theophylline metabolism did not correlate with other indexes of disease severity, whereas lidocaine clearance was lower and lidocaine peak level higher in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and evidence of portal hypertension. Thus impairment in lidocaine disposition, which reflects both hepatocyte dysfunction and portosystemic shunting, correlated closer with the severity of liver disease than did theophylline metabolism.\r"

Oxy/APAP usage was recorded daily along with efficacy and toxicity parameters. Overall global evaluations were also recorded on completion of the study. Comparison of mean differences before and after treatment with ibuprofen or placebo indicated a marked decrease in oxy/APAP use with ibuprofen (p less than 0.01) and a slight increase in use in the placebo group. Reduction in oxy/APAP usage occurred within 24 hours and maximized at 5 days. Overall global scores showed a marked preference for the ibuprofen combination over placebo (p less than 0.01). Daily pain intensity (p less than 0.05) and pain relief scores (p less than 0.05) also improved with the addition of ibuprofen.

  ".W": "Preliminary data have suggested that phenytoin systemic clearance may increase during initial therapy in critically ill patients. The objectives for this study were to model the time-variant phenytoin clearance and evaluate concomitant changes in protein binding and urinary metabolite elimination. Phenytoin was given as an intravenous loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by an initial maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg/day in 10 adult critically ill trauma patients. Phenytoin bound and unbound plasma concentrations were determined in 10 patients and urinary excretion of the metabolite p-hydroxyphenyl phenylhydantoin (p-HPPH) was measured in seven patients for 7 to 14 days. A Michaelis-Menten one-compartment model incorporating a time-variant maximal velocity (Vmax) was sufficient to describe the data and superior to a conventional time-invariant Michaelis-Menten model. Vmax for the time-variant model was defined as V'max + Vmax delta (1 - e(-kindt)). Vmax infinity is the value for Vmax when t is large. The median values (ranges) for the parameters were Km = 4.8 (2.6 to 20) mg/L, Vmax infinity = 1348 (372 to 4741) mg/day, and kind = 0.0115 (0.0045 to 0.132) hr-1. Phenytoin free fraction increased in a majority of patients during the study period, with a binding ratio inversely related to albumin. Measured urinary p-HPPH data were consistent with the proposed model. A loading and constant maintenance dose of phenytoin frequently yielded a substantial, clinically significant fall in plasma concentrations with a pattern of apparently increasing clearance that may be a consequence of changes in protein binding, induction of metabolism, or the influence of stress on hepatic metabolic capacity.\r"

A randomized, double-blind protocol compared the following groups: (1) placebo, (2) triazolam, 1.0 mg, (3) triazolam, 1.5 mg, and (4) morphine, 0.15 mg/kg. Differences between predrug and postdrug administration were compared. Minute ventilation (Ve), end-tidal PCO2, and the ventilatory response to CO2 (Ve/PCO2) were preserved with both 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg triazolam compared with placebo. Triazolam caused an increase in breathing frequency (+21% to 50%; p less than 0.05) as a result of a shortening of inspiratory time. Triazolam was associated with a higher Ve corrected for CO2 production and Ve/PCO2 compared with morphine. We concluded that a single dose of triazolam at two and three times the usual level does not cause respiratory depression in awake, normal subjects but does alter respiratory cycle timing causing an increase in breathing frequency.\r"

It has been suggested that the antihypertensive action of ketanserin might be principally due to alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonism rather than its effect on serotonin receptors. We therefore determined the contribution of alpha-adrenergic blockade to the hypotensive effects of ketanserin in six patients with hypertension and compared that with the alpha-adrenergic blockade produced by prazosin, a known alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist. Each patient received placebo, ketanserin (40 mg every 8 hours), and prazosin (5 mg every 8 hours). Each agent was administered for 4 weeks in random order. Both ketanserin and prazosin lowered blood pressure significantly and to a similar extent. The extent of alpha-adrenergic blockade was determined from the ability to inhibit the hypertensive effect of phenylephrine infusions. The dose of phenylephrine required to raise the blood pressure by 20 mm Hg was significantly higher during both ketanserin (1.41 +/- 0.27 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.05) and prazosin (4.99 +/- 0.77 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.01) administration compared with placebo (0.85 +/- 0.15 micrograms/kg/min). However, the dose ratio was more than fourfold higher during prazosin treatment (7.38 +/- 1.99; p less than 0.05) than during ketanserin (1.69 +/- 0.21). Thus at equipotent hypotensive doses the extent of alpha-blockade produced by ketanserin was more than fourfold lower than that of prazosin, implying that mechanisms other than alpha-blockade must contribute to the antihypertensive actions of ketanserin.\r"

Both active agents were significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measurements (p less than 0.01). Ibuprofen, 400 mg, was more effective than acetaminophen, 1000 mg, on all rating scales, conventional and new, at all time points after 2 hours and overall (p less than 0.01).

The same dose had no effect on the venoconstriction caused by infused noradrenaline (NA) in a further six subjects. 3. It is concluded that ANG II at low doses may cause venoconstriction indirectly by augmenting sympathetically induced venous tone via a presynaptic mechanism. This observation may help to explain the apparent venodilating property of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in clinical situations where the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated.\r"

We re-examined this in 28 subjects with HbCO values compared with rebreathing carbon monoxide [FACO(Rb)] and breath-hold alveolar carbon monoxide and oxygen concentrations, obtained after a 20 s breath-hold [FACO(Bh) and FAO2(Bh), respectively]. Tests were done in the order FACO(Bh) and FAO2(Bh), FACO(Rb), FACO(Bh) and FAO2(Bh) before and after smoking a single cigarette, with HbCO being measured 1 min before and after smoking. 2. The changes were expressed as the relative boost: (Post value-pre value)/(Pre value + post value)/2 X 100 For HbCO the average value was 23.7%, but the FACO(Rb) boost was only 9.8%. The first post-smoking FACO(Bh) boost was 3.9% (5.0 min after smoking), rising to 8.5% 9.4 min later. 3. The FAO2(Bh) values fell from a mean of 15.4% before smoking to 14.3% (5.0 min after smoking) then recovered to 15.4% 9.4 min later, suggesting a transient effect on pulmonary gas exchange. Correction of the first post-smoke FACO(Bh) data for this effect increased the relative boost to 11.5%. Routine FAO2(Bh) measurements may be useful in further smoking studies. 4. We conclude that none of the alveolar sampling techniques gives a reliable measurement of the acute HbCO changes associated with smoking.\r"

In 45 subjects, when one foot was lowered 50 cm below heart level and the other foot kept horizontal, blood flow was progressively reduced in the dependent foot (by 79%) with a concomitant, but less pronounced, reduction in flow in the horizontal foot (by 18%), indicating that a central mechanism is involved. After lumbar sympathetic blockade (in 10 patients with epidural anaesthesia), the flow in the horizontal foot remained virtually constant, indicating that the central component is mainly mediated via efferent sympathetic nerves, whereas the postural fall in flow in the dependent foot, though partially attenuated, was preserved, indicating that a local mechanism is mainly involved. 3. On lowering one foot below heart level in 12 subjects, there was a small but significant reduction in systolic and mean arterial pressures during the first minute of dependency. During the fourth minute, systolic pressure decreased, diastolic pressure and heart rate increased, but the mean arterial pressure was maintained. 4. In 19 subjects postural vasoconstriction was nearly abolished during local nervous blockade (lignocaine 3.7 x 10(-4)-7.4 x 10(-2) mol/l), indicating that the local mechanism mediating the vasoconstriction is mainly neurogenic in nature. However, there was still a small fall (19%) in flow in the dependent foot during blockade, probably indicating a minor contribution of a local myogenic mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On each occasion, the subjects were exposed to distal body subatmospheric pressure (DBSP), 0 to 50 mmHg (0 to 6.65 kPa) in 10 mmHg (1.33 kPa) steps, before infusion, during the final 15 min of the infusion, and at 15 min and 30 min after the cessation of the infusion. 3. Venous adrenaline concentrations of 2.85 +/- 0.22 nmol/l were achieved during the adrenaline infusion, compared with 0.49 +/- 0.07 nmol/l during the saline infusion (P less than 0.001). At 15 min and at 30 min after cessation of the adrenaline infusion, venous adrenaline concentrations had fallen to levels similar to those achieved after the cessation of the saline infusion. 4.

To determine whether preformed mast cell mediators, principally histamine, can initiate a late-phase bronchoconstriction we have investigated the effect on the airways over a 24 h period of a single bronchial challenge with AMP. 2. Six atopic asthmatic subjects (all late responders to inhaled allergen) and six non-atopic asthmatic subjects were studied on two occasions for a 24 h period after inhalation of the provocation concentration of AMP required to produce a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline (PC20) and 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride placebo, respectively. The atopic asthmatic subjects were studied on a further occasion after challenge with the PC20 allergen. 3. Inhalation of the PC20 AMP resulted in an immediate fall in FEV1 to a mean maximum 25.5% below baseline without resulting in any late decrease in airway calibre. No significant increase in non-specific bronchial responsiveness as determined by measuring the PC20 histamine before, and at 3, 9 and 24 h after, AMP challenge, occurred. Inhalation of the PC20 allergen caused a reproducible late-phase bronchoconstriction and increase in non-specific bronchial responsiveness in all the atopic asthmatic subjects studied. 4. These results suggest that preformed mast cell mediators, principally histamine, play no role in the initiation of the late-phase reaction in allergen-provoked asthma, although they may contribute to the inflammatory changes involved.\r"

Hepatic free and total carnitine and long- and short-chain acylcarnitines were assayed by a radioenzymatic method in samples from seven control subjects and seven alcoholics. No significant differences in any of the indices were noted between the patient and control groups and it was concluded that carnitine deficiency did not contribute to alcoholic fatty liver in patients without cirrhosis. 3. Skeletal muscle free and total carnitine and long- and short-chain acylcarnitines were assayed in eight alcoholics and seven control subjects. The alcoholics had significantly higher total and free carnitine levels. It is suggested that this reflects a selective enrichment of the biopsy sample with type I carnitine-rich fibres due to the type II fibre atrophy found in approximately half the patients.\r"

Five age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls. 2. Daily urine volumes were high (4454 +/- 624 ml) in the quadriplegic patients secondary to habitually increased fluid intake. 3. All quadriplegic patients had suppressed plasma arginine vasopressin levels (less than 0.8 pmol/l) and were able to form dilute urine after a water load (20 ml/kg). However, free water clearance and the ability to excrete the water load were frequently impaired, and these defects were associated with reductions in both osmolar clearance and delivery of filtrate to the distal diluting sites of the nephron. 4. During hypertonic saline (5%, w/v, NaCl) infusion, plasma arginine vasopressin rose progressively before plasma osmolality reached the normal range, consistent with a resetting of the osmostat. 5. We conclude that hyponatraemia in quadriplegic patients is related to an intrarenal defect in water excretion and resetting of the osmostat coupled with increased fluid intake.\r"

The most obvious effect was observed during the first 5-min period when a nonmigrating phase-3-like activity (stationary phase 3) occurred, which lasted for 2.6 +/- 0.4 min. This initial pattern was followed by an intense phase 2 activity, characterized by a 10-fold increase in the number of groups of repetitive spike bursts and a sixfold increase in the number of ultrarapid single propagated spike bursts (ultrarapid peristaltic rushes). Cisapride induces in the human upper gut a remarkable pattern of aborally propagated (peristaltic) contractions, which are very likely responsible for the active propulsion of intestinal contents in the interdigestive state.\r"

The patients were divided into two groups depending on the clinical activity indices (group A:five with active form and group B:five with inactive form). The mean level of serum zinc was significantly reduced in group A patients, but not in group B, when compared to findings in control subjects. A significant reduction in AUCpo (area under the concentration vs time curve by peroral administration), accompanied by increased zinc clearance (ClZn) was also found in group A but not in group B. The ClZn significantly correlated with clinical activity indices. Absorption efficiency, the ratio of AUCpo/AUCiv (area under the concentration vs time curve by intravenous administration), was similar in group A, group B, and the control. Therefore, the absorption of zinc in patients with the disease seems to be intact, regardless of whether they have the active or inactive form of Crohn's disease. The hypozincemia seen in patients with Crohn's disease is presumably related to an accelerated turnover rather than to a malabsorption of zinc.\r"

Young and old Fischer 344 rats were prepared with gastric fistulas. Twenty-four hours after surgery, graded doses of human synthetic gastrin-17 (SHG-17) (2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg) were given intravenously in random order. Gastric secretions were collected for gastric acid measurement before and at 15-min intervals after each dose of gastrin. In a separate study, blood was collected and the stomachs were removed for antral gastrin extraction from fed young and old rats. Serum and antral gastrin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The basal and gastrin-stimulated acid secretions were significantly decreased in aged rats compared to the young rats. The basal acid output was 0.4 +/- 0.2 microeq/15 min in the aged rats and 1.5 +/- 0.5 microeq/15 min in the young. The maximal acid output stimulated by gastrin was 11.1 +/- 1.8 microeq/15 min in the aged rats and 24.2 +/- 2.8 microeq/15 min in the young. Both serum and antral concentrations of gastrin were significantly decreased in aged rats. Serum gastrin concentration was 114.8 +/- 7.4 pg/ml in the aged rats and 192.0 +/- 14.4 pg/ml in the young. Antral gastrin concentration was 3.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/g tissue in the aged rats, which was significantly less than the concentration in the young (6.5 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g tissue).

Because of the magnitude of this clinical problem and because of the importance of the upper gastrointestinal tract in its expression, a intradepartmental program of health care for patients affected with the disease was initiated. Eleven consecutive symptomatic bulimic individuals have been evaluated jointly by the gastroenterology and the psychiatry departments of the University of Pittsburgh. Five of these 11 individuals were found to have clinically important upper gastrointestinal pathology including ulcerative esophagitis, erosive gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and delayed gastric emptying. These gastrointestinal conditions could have been either a result of or have contributed to the symptomatology of these five patients. These data suggest that bulimic subjects have clinically important gastroenterological disease processes that require specific diagnosis and treatment independent of the psychiatric treatment provided for the bulimic condition.\r"

All acids were assayed in the fluid obtained from 11 subjects without pancreatic diseases, before and after sequential intravenous injections of 1 unit/kg pancreozymin and 1 unit/kg secretin. Pyruvate concentrations were markedly increased by each stimulation, especially by secretin, and the cumulative excretions of pyruvate and bicarbonate after secretin stimulation were significantly correlated among the subjects. In contrast, lactate concentrations, although high just after administration of pancreozymin, declined to a considerable extent following each injection, rather similar to those of protein or citrate. These data suggest that pyruvate may be secreted from human pancreatic duct cells similar to bicarbonate secretion through mechanisms related to alkaline secretion.\r"

Pretreatment with dopamine hydrochloride (DA: 1-10 mg/kg, subcutaneously) dose-dependently reduced the severity of these lesions. In parallel study, DA had no effect on acid secretion but inhibited gastric motor activity in a dose-related manner. The inhibitory effects of DA on both acidified ethanol-induced lesions and gastric motor activity were significantly reversed by pretreatment with yohimbine, an inhibitor of alpha 2-adrenoceptors (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously), but not by prazosin, haloperidol, or indomethacin. Similar to DA, both norepinephrine (NE: 1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and epinephrine (EPI: 1 mg/kg, subcutaneously) showed inhibition of the motor activity and gastroprotection against acidified ethanol, but these effects were also significantly attenuated by yohimbine. A highly significant relationship was found between the inhibitory effects of DA, NE, and EPI on the motor activity and the mucosal lesions (r = 0.8577, P less than 0.05). In addition, administration of gentian violet (0.5% w/v, per os) stained the mucosa deep blue as elongated wide bands in the corpus region, and such localized staining was significantly prevented by DA, suggesting a flattening of the mucosal foldings in the presence of DA. These results suggest that DA (and other catecholamines) protects the rat gastric mucosa against injury caused by acidified ethanol, probably through inhibition of gastric motor activity mediated with stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors.\r"

Specimens of both normal and injured mucosa were obtained from each of the patients who underwent polypectomy a week prior to the study. The specimens were obtained before and 20 min after intravenous infusion of secretin [2 Crick, Harper and Raper (CHR) units/kg] or saline. The basal content of PGE2 in injured mucosa was three times higher than that in normal gastric mucosa. Secretin did not increase the PGE2 content of normal gastric mucosa. However, secretin induced a sevenfold increase in the PGE2 content of injured mucosa. The content of 6-keto PGF1 alpha was not affected by secretin. These results suggest that, in injured mucosa, PGE2 is involved in the healing process and in the action of secretin as well.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied pepsinogen synthesis and secretion in primary monolayer cultures of canine gastric chief cells. Monolayers were formed after approximately 48 hr. Pepsinogen synthesis was studied by adding 14C-labeled amino acids to the culture medium. Basal secretion of de novo synthesized pepsinogen after 4 hr was 4 +/- 1.2% of total newly synthesized pepsinogen. Basal secretion of stored pepsinogen after 90 min was 8 +/- 1.4% of total pepsinogen content. Carbachol, dbcAMP, forskolin, VIP, CCK-8, and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate all stimulated secretion of de novo synthesized pepsinogen and preformed pepsinogen. Only additive interactions were found. dbcAMP caused a peak outburst of stored pepsinogen in the first 10 min. Carbachol stimulation was time dependent. Stimulation of de novo synthesized pepsinogen secretion was time dependent for both carbachol and dbcAMP. dbcAMP caused an immediate 10-fold increase in pepsinogen synthesis, but carbachol did so only after a lag time of 30 min. This was identical to the time necessary for the appearance of labeled pepsinogen in the medium. Addition of atropine after 2 hr resulted in a return to basal synthesis. Stimulated pepsinogen synthesis was always observed concomitant with stimulated pepsinogen secretion. These results show that most external stimuli for pepsinogen synthesis are dependent upon prior depletion of pepsinogen stores, which then triggers synthesis, while stimulation of cAMP production stimulates pepsinogen synthesis more directly.\r"

In addition, we studied the gastric luminal SLI secretion in response to a gastric luminal acid perfusion in two patients with pernicious anemia. Our results have shown that: (1) pentagastrin caused a parallel increase in luminal hydrogen ions and SLI release in normal volunteers; (2) Zollinger-Ellison patients had elevated basal acid and SLI levels that did not increase further with pentagastrin; (3) pentagastrin did not increase gastric acid or luminal SLI secretion in pernicious anemia patients; and (4) in pernicious anemia patients, a gastric luminal acid perfusion caused a significant increase in gastric luminal SLI over baseline values. In conclusion, gastric luminal hydrochloric acid appears to be a factor which stimulates the secretion of luminal SLI in human beings.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we have investigated a possible functional role of the plasma pattern of GH in regulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA in liver, skeletal muscle, and rib growth plate of the rat. Hypophysectomized male rats given T4 and glucocorticoid replacement therapy were equipped with indwelling jugular venous cannulae attached via swivels to a multichannel pumping system programmed to deliver human GH in a continuous or pulsatile (one pulse per 3 h) pattern for 5 days. At the end of the experiment, skeletal muscle, rib growth plates, and liver from intact and hypophysectomized rats were homogenized, and total nucleic acid was prepared. IGF-I mRNA was quantitated by solution hybridization assay using a RNA probe radiolabeled with [35S]UTP. Pulsatile treatment with GH in a dose of 1.5 U/kg.day induced a 3- to 5-fold increase in the levels of IGF-I mRNA in skeletal muscle and rib growth plates. In contrast, continuous infusion with GH was much less effective in these tissues. In the liver both continuous and pulsatile GH infusion significantly elevated the amount of IGF-I mRNA, and there was no significant difference between these two treatments. In the tissues studied similar results were obtained with a higher dose of GH (3.0 U/kg.day). Pulsatile GH treatment stimulated longitudinal bone growth more effectively than continuous GH treatment, confirming earlier studies. It is concluded that pulsatile GH treatment is more effective than continuous GH infusion in increasing IGF-I mRNA levels in rib growth plate and skeletal muscle, i.e. two major target organs for the anabolic effects of GH.\r"

Ambulatory activity (counts) in the control periods was 298.2 +/- 20.1 in the dark, 35.6 +/- 9.4 in the light, and 343.9 +/- 24.1 over 24 h. After administration of STZ (60 mg/kg, ip), the ambulatory activity gradually decreased [at 3 days: 165.0 +/- 12.3 in the dark (P less than 0.001), 34.0 +/- 10.5 in the light (P = NS), and 199.0 +/- 10.5 over 24 h (P less than 0.001). For determination of statistical significance, values were compared with those at the same time in the control groups. We observed decreased ambulatory activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats during the dark, but not the light, cycle. Moreover, ambulatory activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats gradually decreased, while the blood glucose level rose. Ambulatory activity correlated inversely with blood glucose level (r = -0.76; P less than 0.05). We measured the ratio of dopamine (DA) to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (nanograms per g) in the striatum. The turnover rate of DA was significantly lower in the diabetic rats than in the control group [diabetic, 0.102 +/- 0.003; control, 0.112 +/- 0.001 (mean +/- SE); P less than 0.05]. A negative correlation between the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid to DA ratio and blood glucose level was observed (r = -0.693; P less than 0.01). The present study suggests that there are metabolic abnormalities in the striatum dopaminergic neurons of STZ-induced diabetic rats associated with decreased ambulatory activity.\r"

We administered naloxone (NAL; 2 mg/kg, iv) to regularly cycling estrous rats of three age groups and measured serum LH in serial samples drawn from intraatrial catheters before and after treatment. The serum LH rise 10 min after NAL treatment in 4- to 6-month-old rats was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) compared with that in 1.5- to 3-month-old animals, and no LH response was observed in 8- to 11-month-old rats. On early proestrus, LH secretion was also reduced 10 min after NAL treatment in older vs. younger rats, but all groups demonstrated belated LH rises 1 h after treatment during proestrus. Persistent estrous (PE) rats released less LH after NAL treatment than age-matched estrous rats (P less than 0.025). Higher dose NAL treatment did not increase LH release in estrous or PE rats. These results support the hypothesis that opioid inhibition of LH secretion diminishes with age in cycling rats. Furthermore, opioid tone is a function of estrous state as well as age. PE rats have lower opioid tone than cycling animals of the same age. Our findings suggest a possible role of diminished opiate tone in reproductive senescence.\r"

  ".W": "To identify factors that regulate the tempo of growth and puberty, the present study examined how the environment influenced the timing of menarche and first ovulation in rhesus monkeys and how these events were related to differential rates of growth. Spring-born females were raised from 12 months of age under natural outdoor conditions (OH; n = 6) or indoors (IH; n = 9) under a controlled photoperiod (12h of light, 12h of darkness) and temperature (20-23 C). Ages at the initial increases in serum bioactive LH levels (27.7 +/- 0.7 vs. 31.4 +/- 1.0 months), menarche (26.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 32.5 +/- 0.9 months), and first ovulation (33.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 43.5 +/- 0.3 months) were significantly advanced in IH compared to OH females. First ovulation for the OH females occurred exclusively in October and November of the fourth year, whereas the distribution of first ovulation of IH females was biomodal, with seven of nine occurring in November or December at 31.8 +/- 0.5 months, and two of nine ovulating in September or October at 41.2 +/- 0.5 months. Serum levels of PRL varied seasonally in OH females throughout development, with peaks in July and nadirs in October. A similar rhythm was observed for IH females during the first 12 months of indoor housing, after which point the period decreased from 11.9 +/- 0.5 to 9.3 +/- 0.6 months. Overall increments in body weight did not differ between groups. An acceleration of growth in both crown-rump and tibial lengths occurred just before menarche in both groups, and this occurred at about 26 months for IH and about 32 months for OH females. Skeletal maturity was significantly advanced at 27 months in IH females and at every chronological age thereafter. Serum concentrations of somatomedin-C and GH paralleled group differences in bone maturation. Both hormones were significantly elevated by 16-18 months of age in IH animals compared to OH females and remained so until 34-36 months of age. Although a distinct seasonal rhythm in both GH and somatomedin-C was evident in OH animals, no such pattern was observed in IH females. These data suggest that exposure to an outdoor environment moderates the tempo of both sexual and skeletal maturation. The acceleration in reproductive development in animals exposed to a constant environment was associated with an acceleration in bone maturation, suggesting that common factors may be responsible for the initiation of both events.\r"

Recombinant mPL-I (mPL-Ir) is very similar to placental mPL-I (mPL-Ip) in its recognition by polyclonal antisera raised against either mPL-Ip or mPL-Ir, in displacing [125I]iodo-mPL-II from binding sites on mouse liver microsomal membranes, and in stimulating the synthesis of alpha-lactalbumin in primary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial cells. Structural comparison of mPL-Ir and mPL-Ip by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that mPL-Ir comprises several proteins with mol wt ranging from 34.5-38K, while mPL-Ip consists of a similar set of proteins with mol wt ranging from 36.5-42K. Treatment of the two proteins with neuraminidase resulted in similar 2-4K decreases in mol wt. Treatment of mPL-Ip with peptide:N-glycosidase-F to remove asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains resulted in the formation of 28K and 29K mol wt species, while treatment of mPL-Ir with the same enzyme yielded 28K and 28.5K mol wt products.\r"

Although hPLP-(1-34) was less potent than hPTH-(1-34) in stimulating adenylate cyclase in rat renal membranes, hPLP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) were equipotent in stimulating adenylate cyclase in OK renal cells as well as in UMR 108 osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In osteosarcoma cells, each of these peptides could desensitize adenylate cyclase responses to itself and to the other peptide, but could not reduce stimulation by prostaglandin E2. Renal membranes of vitamin D-deficient rats with secondary hyperparathyroidism had a reduced PLP-stimulated as well as PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase response. The truncated analog hPLP-(3-34) was only a weak partial agonist and an antagonist in vitro, produced equivalent inhibition of hPLP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) in renal and osseous cells, and could not desensitize agonist responses. In thyroparathyroidectomized rats in vivo, hPLP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) increased cAMP excretion, enhanced phosphaturia, maintained plasma calcium, and reduced calciuria. Equimolar concentrations of hPLP-(3-34) produced no increases above control levels; however, high concentrations of this peptide mimicked PTH actions on renal and plasma ion handling while modestly augmenting cAMP excretion. These results demonstrate the importance of the first two residues of PLP for bioactivity, indicate that PLP and PTH interact at common receptor sites in vivo as well as in vitro, suggest that PLP may not be less potent than PTH in renal target cells, and indicate that the net result of interaction of these peptides with their common receptor in target tissues may reflect both activation and desensitization of receptor-mediated events.\r"

Certain spontaneous and transplantable animal tumors also cause this syndrome. The responsible mediator in these animal tumors is not known. We report the isolation of 16K proteins from the rat H500 Leydig cell tumor and the canine apocrine cell adenocarcinoma of the anal sac. Both proteins are potent activators of PTH receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase in bone cells. Both proteins demonstrate similarities in amino acid composition to one another and to the human PTH-like protein. Limited amino-terminal sequence information from the canine protein demonstrates homology with the human PTH-like protein. Antibodies raised to a synthetic human PTH-(1-36)-like peptide cross-react with both the rat and canine proteins in an immunoradiometric assay. These data demonstrate that by physical and immunological criteria PTH-like peptides are present in these animal tumors that appear to be closely related to the human PTH-like peptide. These data further suggest that this protein is not unique to humans, but has an evolutionary origin which extends back at least 65-80 million yr.\r"

The purification procedure consisted of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, heat treatment (60 C; 3.5 min), and sequential chromatographies on agarose gel filtration, hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and S-Sepharose. ASTP had a mol wt of 93,000, as determined by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-0.5 m, and was composed of two apparently identical subunits with mol wt of 48,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficient of ASTP was 6.5s, and its isoelectric point was 4.5. ASTP activity was dependent on the physiological concentration of ATP, although ASTP did not bind to ATP-agarose. Neither ADP nor AMP affected its activity. An analysis of the nuclear binding behavior of GRC suggested that the affinity of GRC for nuclei in the presence of ASTP is much greater than that in the absence of ASTP. In the presence of ATP, ASTP increased the binding of GRC to chromatin, but not to DNA-cellulose, suggesting that ASTP acts as a regulatory component, altering the chromosomal binding of GRC in rat liver.\r"

We investigated their modulation by 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and their involvement in dopamine (DA) and somatostatin (SRIF) inhibition of PRL and GH release. BAY-K-8644 (BAYK), a DHP agonist which increases the opening time of already activated channels, stimulated PRL and GH secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The effect was more pronounced on PRL than on GH release. BAYK-evoked hormone secretion was further amplified by simultaneous application of K+ (30 or 56 mM) to the cell cultures; in parallel, BAYK-induced 45Ca uptake by the cells was potentiated in the presence of depolarizing stimuli. In contrast, BAYK was unable to stimulate LH secretion from male pituitary cells, but it potentiated LHRH- as well as K+-induced LH release; it had only a weak effect on LH secretion from female cell cultures. Basal and BAYK-induced pituitary hormone release were blocked by the Ca2+ channel antagonist nitrendipine. Under no condition did BAYK affect the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides or cAMP formation. Pretreatment of female pituitary cell cultures with E2 (10(-9) M) for 72 h enhanced LH and PRL responses to BAYK, but was ineffective on GH secretion. DA (10(-7) M) inhibited basal and BAYK-induced PRL release from male or female pituitary cells treated or not treated with E2 (10(-9) M). SRIF (10(-9) and 10(-8) M) reversed BAYK-evoked GH release to the same extent in cell cultures derived from male or female animals. It was ineffective on BAYK-induced PRL secretion in the absence of E2, but antagonized it after E2 pretreatment. The effect was dependent upon the time of steroid treatment and was specific, since 17 alpha-estradiol was inactive. In addition, DA and SRIF decreased the 45Ca uptake induced by the calcium agonist. These data demonstrate that DHP-sensitive voltage-dependent calcium channels of the L type present on different pituitary cells are not equally susceptible to BAYK activation under steady state basal conditions, indicating that their spontaneous activity and/or distribution vary according to the cell type; their activity is modulated by sex steroids. In addition, these data suggest that Ca2+ channels represent a possible site of DA and SRIF inhibition of PRL and GH release, respectively, by gating calcium entry into the corresponding cells.\r"

  ".W": "When activated by dithiothreitol, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (I-5'D) activity in kidney microsomes is less sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil (PTU) and iopanoate (IOP) at nanomolar, compared to micromolar, substrate concentrations. The enzymatic activities at nanomolar substrate concentrations are, however, completely eliminated in the presence of a combination of 10 microM IOP and 100 microM PTU. In this report we present evidence that 1) the relative PTU insensitivity results from the residual activities of the high Km enzyme which, while being very sensitive to PTU inhibition at micromolar substrate concentrations, becomes progressively less PTU sensitive as substrate concentrations decline relative to its Km; and 2) the relative IOP insensitivity is due to the presence in kidney microsomes of a low Km enzyme which is relatively insensitive to IOP, but highly sensitive to inhibition by PTU. Classifying the deiodinases on the basis of PTU sensitivity, therefore, requires that not only the thiol concentrations, but, as in the case of the type I enzyme, also the substrate concentrations be specified. The PTU resistance of the type I enzyme at nanomolar substrate concentrations suggests a role of this enzyme in T3 neogenesis in PTU-treated animals.\r"

  ".W": "Glucagon-like materials and glucagon have been identified by immunoassay and immunocytochemistry in the mammalian central nervous system. However, the molecular forms relevant to brain glucagon-like immunoreactivity (GLI) have not been precisely defined. In the rat small intestine, more than 90% of GLI is constituted by two peptides: oxyntomodulin (OXM) and glicentin. This work was initiated to characterize and determine the concentrations of these two peptides and glucagon in the rat central nervous system and to compare their relative proportions with those found in the gut. Different regions from the adult rat brain were analyzed by HPLC in association with RIA, using a central glucagon antiserum and an antibody directed toward the C-terminal end of OXM and glicentin. The elution profiles of hypothalamus extracts were constituted by two main peaks, both detected by the two antibodies used and displaying the same retention times as glicentin and OXM, respectively. A third small peak, which coeluted with glucagon, was constantly recorded with the central glucagon antiserum. The percentages of glicentin, OXM, and glucagon in 10 hypothalami were 37 +/- 1%, 55 +/- 1%, and 8 +/- 2%, respectively (n = 8). This distribution was quite similar to that in small intestinal extracts (38 +/- 1%, 59 +/- 1%, and 1.3 +/- 0.1%, respectively; n = 7); however, the peptide concentrations were almost 50-fold greater in intestine than in hypothalamus. In the medulla oblongata, the same peptide ratio was observed, with 10-fold lower concentrations compared to those in hypothalamus. In olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and cortex the concentrations were close the the detection limit, whereas they could be not detected in the pituitary. The combination of HPLC and specific RIAs allowed us to unambiguously characterize OXM and glicentin as the major components of GLI in the rat hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. The same proportion of these two peptides in the central nervous system and the gut indicates that a similar posttranslational processing exists in these rat tissues, another example of the brain-gut axis.\r"

  ".W": "The steroidogenic actions of angiotensin II (AII) and increased extracellular K+ concentrations [( K+]) in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells are selectively enhanced by the voltage-sensitive calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 (BK 8644). The relationship between these effects of the dihydropyridine agonist and cytosolic calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) was investigated in rat and bovine glomerulosa cells. In the rat glomerulosa cells, AII and increased [K+] elicited rapid elevations of [Ca2+]i with distinctive temporal characteristics. Whereas the [Ca2+]i response to [K+] declined to basal over 2-3 min, addition of 10 nM AII caused a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i, with a rapid transient rise followed by a lower plateau phase that remained above basal for several minutes. BK 8644 alone did not affect [Ca2+]i, but at low concentrations (30 nM) increased the magnitude and duration of the [Ca2+]i response elicited by progressive elevation of extracellular [K+] to 12 mM. In AII-stimulated glomerulosa cells, 30 nM BK 8644 enhanced both phases of the cytosolic calcium response, with a more marked effect on the sustained plateau phase. In contrast to its prominent actions in rat glomerulosa cells, BK 8644 had no effect on AII-stimulated rises in [Ca2+]i in bovine glomerulosa cells, and only slightly enhanced their minor [Ca2+]i responses to potassium. These studies provide evidence that AII activates dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-sensitive calcium channels in rat, but not bovine, adrenal glomerulosa cells. They also suggest that enhancement by BK 8644 of agonist-stimulated [Ca2+]i changes is responsible for its synergistic effects on aldosterone responses to potassium and AII in rat glomerulosa cells and emphasize the importance of the sustained phase of the cytosolic calcium signal in the steroidogenic action of AII.\r"

This results in a growth response manifested by a 1.3-fold increase in weight as a result of selective organomegaly without an apparent increase in skeletal growth. In addition, expression of the endogenous GH and IGF-I genes is inhibited. These results are consistent with IGF-I playing an important role in the control of somatic growth.\r"

  ".W": "The syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta is the site of exchange of nutrients and minerals between the mother and fetus. We have recently demonstrated that PTH influences, in vitro, phosphate transport through the placenta brush border membranes (BBM) and increases cAMP accumulation in placental tissue. To demonstrate the site of binding of PTH in the cytoplasmic membrane, we have purified two polar membranes: the first located on the apical side, the BBM, and the second, on the fetal side, the basal plasma membrane (BPM). BBM were enriched 24-fold in alkaline phosphatase (marker for BBM), and the BPM was enriched 37-fold in binding of [3H] dihydroalprenolol (marker for BPM) compared to homogenate. Both placental membranes contain binding sites (maximum binding = 0.550 +/- 0.032 and 0.298 +/- 0.065 pmol/mg protein for BBM and BPM, respectively) with similar affinities (Kd = 2.05 +/- 0.23 and 1.78 +/- 0.19 nM, respectively) for 125I-[Nle8,Nle18,Tyr34] bovine (b) PTH-(1-34) amide. The three bovine preparations [bPTH-(1-34), its analog [Nle8,Nle18,Try34]bPTH-(1-34) amide, and the antagonist bPTH-(3-34)] were equipotent in binding to both placental membranes. In contrast, human PTH-(1-84) was more effective in displacing the bovine radioligand in BBM. Thyrocalcitonin and insulin, two non-PTH peptides, did not significantly displace the radioligand in BBM and BPM. Adenylate cyclase activity, located exclusively in BPM, was stimulated by PTH. Since the enzyme is absent from BBM, it is probable that the binding of the hormone to this membrane activates another system of messengers.\r"

  ".W": "Human PTH-related protein (hPTHrP) has been characterized as a product of tumor cells with sequence homology to the biologically active amino-terminal portion of human PTH (hPTH). We measured the relative activities of synthetic amino-terminal sequences of hPTH-(1-34) and hPTHrP-(1-34) to stimulate production of cAMP in intact human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. Both peptides enhanced cAMP production at concentrations of 2.5-7.5 X 10(-10) M, had parallel dose-response curves, and were of essentially equal potency. Preincubation of SaOS-2 cells with hPTH-(1-34) or hPTHrP-(1-34) for 1 or 4 h induced homologous desensitization to a second challenge with the same peptide as well as heterologous desensitization to the other PTH peptide, but had little or no effect on the action of vasoactive intestinal peptide; the magnitudes of homologous and heterologous desensitization induced by the same doses of hPTHrP-(1-34) or hPTH-(1-34) were similar. Bone resorption-stimulating activity was measured using 40Ca2+ release from neonatal mouse calvariae in organ culture after 72 h of incubation. hPTHrP-(1-34) gave a dose-response between 0.2 and 5 ng/ml (5 X 10(-11) and 1.2 X 10(-9) M), was about 3 times more potent than Lilly bovine PTH standard (assuming a SA of 3000 U/mg; 100 U/ml), gave the same maximum response as hPTH-(1-34), and was 20-30% as potent as hPTH-(1-34). Neither hPTH-(1-34) nor hPTHrP-(1-34) enhanced prostaglandin production in mouse calvariae, and indomethacin did not inhibit the bone resorption-stimulating activities of either peptide. We conclude that hPTHrP-(1-34) and hPTH-(1-34) have similar high specific biological activities to stimulate production of cAMP in human osteoblast-like cells, but that hPTHrP-(1-34) is modestly less potent than hPTH-(1-34) to stimulate bone resorption in mouse calvariae.\r"

This study examined the distribution of estradiol and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively) within the primate ovary throughout the menstrual cycle. Ovaries were collected from rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys during the early, mid-, and late (n = 3-6/stage) follicular and luteal phases of the cycle. The tissues were processed for indirect immunocytochemical localization of receptors with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER (H222 and D75) and PR (JZB39). Specific immunocytochemical staining, as determined by comparing adjacent tissue sections incubated with either receptor antibodies or a nonspecific antibody, was exclusively nuclear. Both ER and PR were localized in the germinal epithelium of ovaries at all stages of the cycle. ER was not detected in any other ovarian structure (i.e. stroma, follicles, interstitial tissue, or corpora lutea) regardless of the stage of development. However, ER was detected in other estrogen-responsive tissues, e.g. the oviduct of the monkey and corpora lutea of the pseudopregnant rabbit. In the monkey ovary, PR was detected in stromal and interstitial tissues as well as theca interna and externa of healthy and atretic follicles at all stages of the cycle. The granulosa cells of some primordial and primary follicles demonstrated staining for PR. However, the granulosa layer of follicles that developed beyond the primary stage were consistently negative for PR. Only the granulosa layer of large preovulatory follicles that showed signs of luteinization after the LH surge showed staining for PR equivalent to that in the theca. Monkey corpora lutea exhibited specific nuclear staining for PR. Moreover, the percentage of receptor-positive nuclei in the corpus luteum varied (P less than 0.05) between the early (28 +/- 3%), mid (48 +/- 1%)-, and late (4 +/- 2%) luteal phase of the cycle. Nonfunctional (serum progesterone less than 0.5 ng/ml) regressing corpora lutea did not exhibit for staining for PR. Luteal cells that were PR positive also contained histochemically detectable 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. These data are consistent with the concept of a receptor-mediated autocrine or paracrine role for progestins, but not estrogens in the gametogenic and endocrine functions of the primate ovary throughout the menstrual cycle.\r"

We investigated the effects of long term (0-16 weeks) LH deprivation on the volume of an average Leydig cell, the volume of Leydig cells per testis, the number of Leydig cells per testis, and testosterone secretion by in vitro perfused testes. Endogenous LH was suppressed in adult rats by testosterone/estradiol-filled (TE) Silastic implants. The presence of Leydig cells in testes was verified by 1) morphological examination using light and electron microscopy, 2) histochemical localization of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (3 beta HSD), and 3) conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone by in vitro perfused testes. Marked quantitative differences existed in Leydig cell morphology among control and treated rats. The volume of an average Leydig cell and the total volume of Leydig cells per testis decreased (P less than 0.01) rapidly and progressively after TE implantation. At 16 weeks, the average Leydig cell lost 90% of its cytoplasmic volume and 65% of its nuclear volume. Analysis of variance failed to detect a significant decline in Leydig cell number per testis, despite a 16% reduction from the value in control rats (22.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(6)) in rats treated for 16 weeks (18.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(6)). After TE implantation, LH-stimulated testosterone secretion by in vitro perfused testes diminished (P less than 0.01) rapidly to 5% of the control values at 1 week and less than 0.3% of the control value from 4-16 weeks. In contrast, 25% of 3 beta HSD activity was retained (P less than 0.01 vs. controls) at 16 weeks, based on the rate of pregnenolone conversion to progesterone. Moreover, testes of treated rats secreted progesterone at a rate twice that of controls, when the steroid secretion rates were expressed per volume of Leydig cell cytoplasm. Loss of the testosterone-secreting capacity of testes after LH withdrawal was associated with a loss in the volume, but not a significant loss in the number, of Leydig cells. Thus, LH was required to maintain the differentiated structure and function of Leydig cells, but was not required to maintain the overwhelming majority of Leydig cells in the adult rat testis through 16 weeks. Moreover, at least one steroidogenic enzyme, 3 beta HSD, was retained by Leydig cells after long term LH deprivation.\r"

The difference between the enantiomers was abolished at 4 C, and metabolic and endocytotic inhibitors reduced nuclear and extranuclear saturable uptake of L-T3 to a similar degree, but had little or no effect on D-T3 uptake. The affinity constants (Ka) for L- and D-T3 binding to isolated nuclei were similar, but the apparent nuclear Ka of L-T3 in intact cells was 5-fold greater than that of D-T3. The findings suggest that stereospecific transport, mainly active at the plasma membrane, occurs in rat skeletal muscle cells. This discriminative pathway of cell entry facilitates L-T3 uptake by an energy-dependent pathway not shared by D-T3 and may explain the greater potency of L-T3 than D-T3.\r"

To examine whether IGF-I may also regulate the release of PRL from human decidual tissue, we have investigated the effect of recombinant human IGF-I on PRL release from monolayer cultures of human decidual cells exposed to IGF-I for up to 4 days. IGF-I (10-1000 ng/ml) stimulated a sustained dose-dependent increase in PRL release (half-maximal concentration, 25 ng/ml) beginning 48 h after initial exposure, but had no effect on the intracellular PRL content. The amounts of PRL released from maximally stimulated cultures on days 3 and 4 were 168 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) and 258 +/- 8% of control values, respectively. IGF-I-mediated effects were inhibited by cycloheximide (3.6 microM), suggesting that the increase in PRL was the result of newly synthesized hormone. The increase in PRL release was not due to a generalized effect on protein release, since IGF-I had no effect on the release of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [35S]methionyl proteins. Radioligand competition studies indicate that the biological actions of IGF-I are mediated through interaction with the IGF-I receptor. Binding of radiolabeled IGF-I to decidual cells in suspension was specific, saturable, and displacable by unlabeled IGF-I, with a potency nearly 10 times greater than that of insulin. Furthermore, exposure of decidual cells to a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor (alpha-IR3) completely inhibited both IGF-I-mediated PRL release and specific binding of [125I]IGF-I to decidual cells. Since the actions of IGF-I occurred at physiological concentrations, these findings strongly support a role for IGF-I in the regulation of PRL secretion by human decidua.\r"

Testicular cells obtained from neonatal rats (8-9 days of age) were maintained in culture for 3 days and then challenged with LH with or without basic FGF. After 3 additional days of culture, the media were collected for steroid RIA. LH treatment of cultured cells stimulated testosterone production in a dose-dependent fashion whereas FGF alone did not affect androgen biosynthesis. In contrast, cotreatment with FGF caused a dose-dependent decrease of LH-stimulated testosterone production, with an IC50 value of 1.1 X 10(-9) M (as calculated from three separate experiments). The inhibitory effect of FGF was evident 24 h after the initiation of treatment and this effect was reversible 1 day after the cessation of FGF treatment. The inhibition of LH-induced testosterone production by FGF (maximal inhibition greater than 90%) was accompanied by a 12-fold increase in progesterone levels, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of FGF was distal to the step of progesterone formation. FGF also inhibited forskolin (10(-5) M)- and (Bu)2cAMP (5 X 10(-4) M)-stimulated testosterone production. Furthermore, FGF inhibited the conversion of exogenously added androgen precursors (progesterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone) to testosterone in LH-stimulated cultures indicating that FGF might inhibit 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The concept of a direct testicular action of FGF was further supported by the demonstration of high affinity (Kd: 3.9 X 10(-10) M; n = 3 experiments) and low capacity (46,900 sites per cell) FGF receptors in cultured testis cells. The binding of [125I]FGF was inhibited by basic and acidic FGF but not by several other growth factors. In conclusion, we suggest that FGF binds to testicular cells and inhibits LH-stimulated testosterone production by inhibiting, at least partially, 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme activities. Because FGF has been purified from testis extracts, this growth factor may have intratesticular paracrine or autocrine functions.\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), and glycoproteins containing mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), bind to two different sites of the same receptor molecule (Morgan et al, Nature 329:301, 1987). To study the interactions between the two ligands on their common receptor in intact cells, we examined the effect of free M6P on IGF-II binding and endocytosis in the IM9 human lymphoblastoid cell line. M6P, up to a 3 mM concentration, had no effect on the binding of IGF-II to the cell surface receptor of intact IM9 cells at 4 degrees C. By contrast, when IM9 cells were incubated with 125I-IGF-II at 37 degrees C, 1 mM M6P increased cell-associated radioactivity by twofold. The increase was resistant to acid wash at 4 degrees C, and therefore assumed to represent endocytosed IGF-II. Acid-washable radioactivity was no different, confirming that, in intact cells, M6P does not affect IGF-II surface binding. In addition, preincubation of cells with M6P at 37 degrees C for up to 3 hours did not change the abundance of receptor on the cell surface, as measured by a subsequent 4 degrees C binding assay. We conclude that M6P causes a shift of IGF-II-occupied receptors form the cell surface to intracellular locations without affecting surface binding of this ligand in IM9 cells. The effect could be produced by the binding of M6P itself, or by the displacement of endogenous phosphomannosylated ligands.\r"

The biological properties of cPTH-(1-34)NH2 were evaluated and compared to the bovine fragment bPTH-(1-34) in several assays. The potency of cPTH-(1-34)NH2 in binding to PTH receptors, in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity and in relaxing smooth muscle tissue was approximately one-tenth that of bPTH-(1-34). Comparison of the avian sequence to other native PTH related sequences suggests that changes in the binding domain of the 1-34 active fragment may account for the decline in potency.\r"

Rectal biopsies were taken 15 cm from the anal verge after five days on the diets and mucosal cell proliferation was measured by labelling index (LI). The LI was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in group (c) (9.2) than in group (a) (5.9), with group (b) intermediate (6.8). In multiple stepwise regression analysis, the data were best fitted with age and the variable indicating fat consumed as a bolus as predictors of LI (r2 = 0.39, p less than 0.001). In separate analyses the regression coefficient with age in the fat bolus group was 0.23, p less than 0.001. There was some tendency towards lower bile acids in the faecal water in group (a) than in groups (b) and (c) following the diets and between the bile acids and LI (for lithocholic acid r = 0.48, p = 0.01). These data show that dietary fat given as a bolus can lead to an increase in the proliferation of human colonic cells, possibly as a consequence of raised levels of cytotoxic acidic lipids in the faecal stream.\r"

The rate of bone loss showed a significant negative correlation with body mass index (r = -0.276, p less than 0.05) but no other significant correlations were found with other clinical or biochemical indices, including the total amount of prednisolone taken during the course of the study. Eleven patients had bone loss greater than 15 mg/ml/year; these included four non-steroid treated patients, two of whom had disease confined to the large bowel. The results indicate rapid rates of bone loss in some patients with inflammatory bowel disease over the course of one year. Although steroid therapy and malnutrition are likely to be contributory factors in some patients, other, as yet unidentified, risk factors also operate. The rapid bone loss observed in some patients emphasises the need for effective prophylactic regimes.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in the rat jejunum in vivo have shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) causes secretion of fluid and luminal release of prostaglandin (PG) E2. These effects can be blocked by indomethacin and ketanserin, which suggests that PGE2 may be an important intermediate in the transduction mechanism leading to 5-HT induced fluid secretion. To test this hypothesis in man 'steady state' perfusions (9 ml/min) were done in eight healthy volunteers using the triple lumen technique. The proximal jejunum was perfused with Ringer's solution which contained 51Cr-EDTA as a non-absorbable marker. Before and after the administration of indomethacin (1.0 mg/kg iv) the effects of exogenous 5-HT (10 micrograms/kg/min iv) on jejunal net transport of fluid and electrolytes and jejunal flow rate (JFR) of PGE2 were measured in 15-min periods for 2 x 60 minutes after a 60 minute control period. 5-HT reversed fluid and electrolyte absorption into profuse secretion (p less than 0.01, Duncan's multiple range test) and significantly increased JFR of PGE2 (p less than 0.01). Indomethacin partly restored fluid and electrolyte absorption (p less than 0.01) and inhibited JFR of PGE2 (p less than 0.05). These results provide further evidence in favour of the theory that PGs are involved in 5-HT induced intestinal fluid secretion.\r"

Dextrose solutions in the range 5-25 g/dl have been reported to empty from the human stomach at a constant caloric rate of 2.1 kcal/min. This study examined, in 12 healthy volunteers, the effects of intraduodenal dextrose on pyloric motility. Dextrose solutions, 5, 10, 15, and 25 gde/dl and saline solutions, 0.9 and 2.7 g/dl were infused into the duodenum at 4 ml/min for 10 minutes. Antral, pyloric, and duodenal motility were monitored with sideholes and a sleeve sensor positioned across the pylorus. Significant increases in the rate of isolated pyloric pressure waves and in basal pyloric pressure were seen with 15 and 25 g/dl dextrose (p less than 0.02) and 2.7 g/dl saline (p less than 0.05). The intensity and duration of the phasic and tonic pyloric motor responses to intraduodenal dextrose were dose dependent and correlated directly with the rate of calorie delivery (p less than 0.005 for each parameter). Intraduodenal delivery of dextrose at a rate in excess of 2.1 kcal/min stimulates both phasic and tonic pyloric contraction. These changes in pyloric motility may contribute to the close regulation of the emptying of dextrose from the stomach.\r"

The serum gastrin response to secretin was used to identify the presence of gastrinoma, that to a test meal of G-cell hyperfunction of the antral and/or duodenal mucosa, and that to bombesin to differentiate antral from duodenal G-cell hyperfunction. Seven patients had basal hypergastrinaemia and hyperchlorhydria. These patients had increased serum gastrin responses to secretin (p less than 0.01) and to bombesin (p less than 0.02), but normal postprandial responses. In the 13 normogastrinaemic patients the responses to the three stimuli were normal. In families with MEN-I gastrinoma is the only endocrine disorder accounting for abnormal gastrin secretion. G-cell function is normal in obligate carriers of the MEN I-gene.\r"

Mucosal protection was greater with ingestion of sucralfate 300 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, than with 100 mg/kg. The intragastric pH was higher (p less than 0.001) in sucralfate treated groups at pH 3.9 and 6.5.

Different areas of the pancreas could be stratified by amount of DMH into 'high' (hyperplasia score greater than 0.09), 'intermediate' (0.06-0.09), and 'low' (less than 0.06). There was no significant difference in either prevalence or amount of DMH with variation in ampullary or pancreatic ductal anatomy. There was significantly (p less than 0.05) less DMH adjacent to the accessory papilla when it was patent, compared with when it was not patent and the accessory duct communicated with the main pancreatic duct. The findings suggest that DMH is a proliferative response to exogenous agents which injure the pancreas, and that some areas of the pancreas are more vulnerable than others to this damage. There was no evidence that this injury was associated either with reflux, or with any particular variation in pancreatic duct anatomy. The association between DMH and occlusion of the accessory papilla may explain the susceptibility of pancreas divisum to pancreatitis.\r"

Quantitative 99mTc-DISIDA scans lasted 60 minutes, activity/time curves being created by computer analysis using the entire hepatobiliary system as region-of-interest (ROI). Scintigraphic analysis demonstrated that the time in minutes to maximum counts (Tmax) was significantly increased in the SO dysfunction group compared with the non-biliary pain group and the asymptomatic volunteers (p less than 0.001). The per cent of biliary tracer emptied was also significantly less in the SO dysfunction group than either of the other groups at both 45 minutes (p less than 0.01) and 60 minutes (p less than 0.02).

Morphine was given in four successive doses of 2.5, 2.5, 5, and 10 micrograms/kg iv at five minute intervals. Morphine in subanalgesic doses increased the frequency of SO phasic pressure waves to a maximum of 10-12/min, caused the phasic waves to occur simultaneously along the sphincter segment, increased phasic wave amplitude from 72 (26) (SE) to 136 (31) mmHg, and increased SO basal pressure from 10 (1) to 29 (9) mmHg (p less than 0.05). The effects of morphine on the SO are mediated by more than one opioid receptor type, as naloxone competitively antagonised the increase in phasic wave frequency induced by morphine, but did not affect the increase in SO basal pressure elicited by morphine. When given after naloxone, morphine decreased phasic wave amplitude, an inhibitory effect that is normally masked by morphine's dominant naloxone sensitive excitatory effect. Mu receptors do not appear to be involved in control of spontaneous SO motor function, as naloxone alone did not affect SO motor activity. The excitatory effects of morphine on the SO are not mediated by cholinergic nerves, as they were not blocked by atropine. Cholinergic nerves, however, may have a role in regulating spontaneous SO motor function because atropine alone depressed phasic wave activity and basal pressure. Although morphine does cause 'spasm' of the human SO, its effects are more complex than is commonly believed.\r"

This could be due to an increased activation of the drug to a toxic metabolite or to a decreased capacity to detoxify the toxic metabolite by conjugation with glutathione (GSH). To test these hypotheses paracetamol 2 g was administered to five chronic alcoholics without clinical evidence of alcoholic liver disease and five control subjects. The urinary excretion of cysteine- plus N-acetyl-cysteine-paracetamol, the two major products of detoxification of the reactive metabolite of paracetamol, was not significantly higher in chronic alcoholics arguing against a substantially increased metabolic activation of paracetamol. Chronic alcoholics had significantly lower plasma concentrations of GSH than healthy volunteers, however (4.35 (1.89) microM v 8.48 (2.68) microM, p less than 0.05) before the administration of paracetamol, and plasma GSH reached lower concentrations in the alcoholics after paracetamol (2.40 (1.36) v 6.26 (2.96) microM). In a group of patients with alcoholic hepatitis intrahepatic GSH was significantly lower than in patients with chronic persistent hepatitis and patients with non-alcoholic cirrhosis, suggesting that low plasma GSH in alcoholics reflects low hepatic concentrations of GSH. The data indicate that low GSH may be a risk factor for paracetamol hepatotoxicity in alcoholics because a lower dose of paracetamol will be necessary to deplete GSH below the critical threshold concentration where hepatocellular necrosis starts to occur.\r"

Perfusion at 10 ml/min of a first mixture of aminoacids - phenylalanine (47.2 mmol), methionine (38.2 mmol), tryptophan (11 mmol), valine (61.6 mmol) - increased cholecystokinin (CCK) plasma concentrations and duodenal bile salt output (p less than 0.005) as compared with a control electrolyte solution, but did not change pancreatic enzyme secretion significantly; duodenal infusion of another aminoacid mixture - arginine (32.4 mmol), histidine (14.1 mmol), leucine (36 mmol), isoleucine (21.5 mmol), lysine (31 mmol), threonine (23 mmol) - did not change CCK plasma concentrations, bile salt or pancreatic enzyme output. The respective role of duodenal distension and endogenous CCK was investigated by perfusing the first aminoacid solution and the control solution at 2, 5, and 10 ml/min. Changing the perfusion rate of control solution from 2 to 5 ml/min led to a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in pancreatic secretion with no further increase at 10 ml/min. Bile salt output was not influenced by the perfusion rate of control solution. During the perfusion of the aminoacid solution, despite a stepwise increase in CCK release, the only significant change in pancreatic secretion was an increase of lipase output (p less than 0.05) when the infusion rate was raised from 2 to 5 ml/min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Similarly, in the ascites group, median noradrenaline was increased 2.5-4.2 and median adrenaline 1.8-2.5 times that of the other groups. Plasma methionine enkephalin is considerably raised in patients with cirrhotic ascites and has actions which could enable it to be an initiating factor of ascites formation.\r"

Mass movements were recorded from proximal and distal colon during 24 h (12 noon-12 noon) by a colonoscopically positioned multilumen manometric probe and low compliance infusion system. Patients and controls differed significantly in the number (mean 2.6 (0.7) v 6.1 (0.9) (SE), p = 0.02) and duration (mean 8.2 (1.6) v 14.1 (0.8) s, p = 0.04) of mass movements. The data suggest that one pathophysiological mechanism of constipation may be decreased propulsive activity. A circadian pattern, with a significant difference between day and night distribution, was documented in both groups. The patients reported decreased defecatory stimulus concomitant with the mass movements.\r"

Oral sennosides (30 mg/kg) inhibited colonic motility for 12 to 18 h after a three to six hours delay, and associated with giant contractions and diarrhoea. The minimal oral dose of sennosides to produce such changes varied from 5 to 15 mg/kg. Intracolonic sennosides at the minimal effective dose and at 30 mg/kg reproduced the effects of oral sennosides, but with a shorter latency (0.5-1.5 h). Intracolonic PGE2 (100 micrograms/kg) in viscous gel medium or intra-arterial PGE2 (10 micrograms/h) inhibited colonic motility and induced giant contractions often associated with defecation. The colonic motor changes induced by intracolonic sennosides at the minimal effective dose, but not those induced by intracolonic PGE2, were blocked by intra-arterial indomethacin (10 micrograms/h) or piroxicam (5 micrograms/h). These results suggest that colonic motor actions of sennosides are mediated through a local prostaglandins synthesis, as they were blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitor and reproduced by PGE2.\r"

As refined sugar intake and smoking are themselves associated we have enquired about smoking and added sugar intake (AS) and smoking in CD using a postal questionnaire sent to 104 CD patients and 153 community controls. Smoking and AS were associated with one another. After adjusting for AS, smoking showed a significant association with CD with a relative risk of 1.8. After adjusting for smoking habit, AS was also strongly associated with CD in never and exsmokers and in a dose response pattern, with the relative risks for no AS, less than 50 g/day and greater than 50 g/day being respectively 1.0, 1.8, and 4.6 (chi 2 = 12.1; p less than 0.005). No association between CD and AS was evident in smokers. The AS relationship was supported by a separate association between frequency of confectionery consumption and CD. These findings indicate that while smoking and AS are individually associated with CD combined exposure results in no further increase in risk, suggesting that they may operate through a common mechanism.\r"

Animals were pretreated with allopurinol or superoxide dismutase together with catalase, before administration of PAF. Superoxide dismutase/catalase markedly improved the PAF-induced lesions, indicating that most of the intestinal damage after PAF injection is because of the release of oxygen radicals. The major source of oxygen radicals is xanthine oxidase, as allopurinol ameliorated small bowel lesions. Pretreatment with allopurinol produced a significant (p less than 0.01) preventive effect on PAF induced hypotension. In contrast, superoxide dismutase/catalase did not alter PAF induced hypotension. Superoxide dismutase/catalase pretreatment improved PAF induced haemoconcentration and leucopenia, while allopurinol showed no effect.\r"

Sequential cell populations harvested by a stepwise scraping technique from colonic crypt regions were identified by histology and incorporation of [3H]-thymidine into DNA. cAMP-independent phosphorylation of casein, in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP, was markedly suppressed by quercetin, a bioflavonoid known to inhibit G-type casein kinase, protein kinase-C and tyrosine protein kinase. Conversely, the cyclic nucleotide regulatable form requiring histone as substrate was responsive to the action of the heat stable protein kinase inhibitor. The protein kinase species were characterised and partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in colonic cytosols (pmol 32P/min/mg protein, means (SE)) increased from 129.4 (15.9) in superficial cell populations to 238.5 (31.4) in lower crypt cell fractions (p less than 0.01). Colonic cAMP-independent protein kinase activity increased from 87.3 (15.6) in surface cell preparations to 178.1 (30.0) in lower crypt cell populations (p less than 0.02). A comparable activity gradient was observed in membrane fractions. The activity gradient persisted when the results were expressed as a function of cellular DNA. These findings indicate that protein kinases display a defined topological segregation along the colonic crypt regions and that during migration to the lumen colonic cells attenuate enzyme signals supposedly related to tissue growth.\r"

We have used cloned genomic DNA probes derived from a CD isolated mycobacteria strain Ben, to investigate the presence of mycobacterial DNA sequences in CD tissues. DNA was extracted from total tissue from 17 CD and four control gut specimens. DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed and transferred to nylon membranes by Southern blotting and hybridised to radiolabelled DNA probes. No mycobacterial DNA was detected in any tissue sample studied. Reconstitution experiments with known numbers of in vitro cultured mycobacteria showed sensitive detection of mycobacterial DNA. DNA extracted from mouse liver, infected with M lepraemurium revealed a strong hybridisation signal and showed the applicability of the experimental approach to the detection of mycobacterial DNA in naturally infected tissues. The results do not provide evidence for the involvement of mycobacteria in the pathogenesis of CD but do not exclude the possibility of low levels of infection in subsets of intestinal cells with spheroplast or cell wall deficient forms of mycobacteria.\r"

Of the initial sample, 122 (72%) were working and there were only three (1%) registered unemployed. After six years a similar proportion were working and only seven (5%) were unemployed. Continuity of employment was good with 57% in the same job. Changes in work because of health had been made by 72 patients mainly caused by bowel disease. After surgery 10% completely changed and 22% modified their work while a few had to retrain or retire. Panproctocolectomy and ileostomy resulted in more changes and longer time off work after surgery than colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, with 35% and 17% respectively off work after one year. Problems at work, in particular general malaise and arthritis were experienced by 34 (28%) patients. Fewer problems were experienced by patients with a stoma who also had less sickness absence than those without a stoma. Colleagues and employers were usually supportive although some patients encountered discrimination especially those with a stoma or working in the food industry. Few patients had been counselled on their work. In general employment prospects and time off work were good and employers should be encouraged to take an optimistic and supportive role. Doctors should consider that convalescence after surgery may be longer than they perceive and must provide better counselling for patients.\r"

In order to further explore the role of the small bowel in IBS several stimuli were applied, in an attempt to unmask the dysmotility of the jejunum and ileum. These included infusions of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-OP), a high fat meal, neostigmine and balloon distension of the ileum. Three groups (n = 8) each of age and sex matched healthy volunteers were studied; patients with IBS complained of predominant constipation (n = 8) or diarrhoea (n = 8). Patients with IBS responded excessively to stimulation by CCK-OP, fatty meal, and ileal distension. In general patients with diarrhoea were more sensitive to stimuli than those with constipation. The ileum responded more to stimulation than the jejunum. As in the large bowel, stimuli appear to unmask intestinal dysmotility in patients with IBS. Motor abnormalities were often accompanied by abdominal symptoms, raising the possibility that dysfunction of the small bowel contributes to the symptoms of IBS.\r"

After 2.5 h, fractional rates of protein synthesis (defined as the percentage of tissue protein renewed each day by synthesis and RNA efficiencies (defined as the amount of protein synthesised per unit RNA) were measured with a large flooding dose (0.3 Ci/mol; 150 mmol/l; 150 mumol/100 g body weight; iv) of [4(3)H]-phenylalanine. Rats were killed 10 minutes after injection of the isotope and portions of the small intestine were rapidly dissected and frozen. Tissues and plasma were processed for phenylalanine specific radioactivities to obtain fractional rates of protein synthesis or protein synthesis rates relative to RNA. Rates of protein synthesis in mixed tissue proteins fell approximately 15-25% (p ranged from less than 0.005 to greater than 0.05), in response to acute ethanol dosage. The decrease in the synthesis rates of the cytoplasmic protein fraction was similar (p less than 0.025). Proteins extracted from the smooth muscle contractile apparatus, however, showed a greater response to ethanol--that is, 40-50% inhibition in protein synthesis (p less than 0.001). It is therefore possible that the functional disturbances in the ethanol-exposed gut may be because of changes in smooth muscle protein turnover with decreased amounts of contractile apparatus.\r"

  ".W": "The pattern of gastric emptying after truncal vagotomy and drainage is usually biphasic. An early rapid phase is followed by a characteristically abrupt transition to slow emptying. The mechanisms responsible for this pattern were studied in six dogs with truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty, fitted with a proximal duodenal cannula. Gastric emptying was measured using gamma camera imaging of a radiolabelled 15% dextrose test meal. Sixty one hour studies were done using five designs. (1) With the cannula closed gastric emptying was initially rapid, followed by stasis (emptying at 15 min - 32% (5.3), 60 min - 34% (4.8); mean (SE)). (2) With the cannula open emptying was very rapid (15 min - 76% (4.2) p less than 0.001, 60 min - 88% (2.6) p less than 0.001 ANOVA). (3) Distal duodenal instillation of isotonic saline, at a rate equivalent to gastric emptying with the cannula closed, did not retard this rapid emptying (15 min - 78% (10.6), 60 min - 90% (5.4)). (4) With duodenal instillation of 15% dextrose, gastric emptying remained faster than in studies without diversion (15 min - 50% (7.0) NS, 60 min - 65% (6.8) p less than 0.01), but was slower than during diversion alone (p less than 0.05). (5) Finally, duodenal instillation of 15% dextrose before administration of the test meal produced slower initial emptying without subsequent stasis (15 min - 24% (4.5), 60 min - 47% (10.6)), although the amounts emptied were not significantly different from those with the cannula closed. These results indicate that after truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty small bowel resistances play a significant role in controlling gastric emptying.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ninety two instances corresponded to lymphocytic gastritis, while 100 did not show any particular microscopic feature and were labelled non-specific gastritis. There was a good correlation (48 of 58) between the diagnosis of the so-called varioliform gastritis and the histological evidence of lymphocytic gastritis. The correlation was even better when nodules, erosions, and enlarged folds were considered. Lymphocytic gastritis has a typical endoscopical appearance consisting of nodules, erosions, and large folds predominating in the gastric body. This contrasts with non-specific gastritis, which affects the antrum and produces erosions on a flat mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "A patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia developed jaundice revealing peliosis hepatis after receiving 6-thioguanine for two months. Peliosis hepatis was severe and was associated with mild lesions of centrilobular veins. Withdrawal of 6-thioguanine was followed by a progressive improvement of liver dysfunction. This report shows that 6-thioguanine, a thiopurine already reported to be responsible for veno-occlusive disease of the liver, can induce peliosis hepatis. This suggests that some liver vascular disorders caused by thiopurines (6-thioguanine, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), particularly peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease, sinusoidal dilatation and perisinusoidal fibrosis, might be related syndromes caused by similar lesions at different sites.\r"

Concentrations of prostaglandin E2 were increased in plasma, gastric juice, gastric mucosa and urine. He had marked hypochlorhydria in response to pentagastrin stimulation (Peak acid output (PAO) pg:0.2 mmol/h). After successful hepatic arterial embolisation of the metastases (as indicated by an 85% decrease in 24 h urinary 5-HIAA) the concentrations of prostaglandin E2 decreased in the plasma, gastric juice and gastric mucosa. The gastric mucosal hypertrophy regressed and secretion of acid in response to pentagastrin returned (PAO pg:9.0 mmol/h). These findings suggest that the carcinoid tumour was producing a substance which stimulated increased local synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in the gastric mucosa, with concomitant gastric mucosal hypertrophy and inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\r"

Unanticipated loss of reduction of the fracture after dynamic intramedullary nailing of the femur may result from errors in surgical decision-making, specifically the failure to insert both proximal and distal interlocking screws. Of 133 dynamic femoral intramedullary nailings that were performed after interlocking techniques became routinely available, fourteen (10.5 per cent) were complicated by loss of postoperative fixation and reduction. Thirteen of the fourteen femora shortened an average of 2.0 centimeters; the remaining femur shortened slightly, with clinical loss of rotational stability. Eight of fourteen patients elected some form of surgical revision, most commonly closed osteoclasis with restoration of femoral length, followed by the insertion of a statically locked nail. Errors in surgical judgment were attributed to inadequate preoperative analysis of the pattern of the fracture; undetected intraoperative comminution during reaming or insertion of the nail, or both; or postoperative failure to recognize an increase in comminution and instability of the fracture. We suggest using high-quality preoperative radiographs to detect non-displaced comminution of the major fracture fragments. Any increase in comminution of the fracture that occurs with reaming of the canal or insertion of the nail is an indication for static interlocking fixation. Radiographs that are made immediately postoperatively should be analyzed while the patient is under anesthesia, and any previously undetected instability of the fracture should be treated by static interlocking fixation. Dynamic intramedullary stabilization of the femur should be reserved for transverse or short oblique fractures at the femoral isthmus that have type-I or type-II comminution.\r"

  ".W": "A consecutive, prospective series of ninety-seven patients who had 100 fractures of the femoral shaft that were treated with static interlocking nailing was analyzed to determine the incidence of union of the fracture without planned conversion from static to dynamic intramedullary fixation as a technique to stimulate healing of the fracture. Eighty-four patients (eighty-seven fractures) were studied through union of the fracture (average follow-up, fourteen months). Eighty-five (98 per cent) of the eighty-seven fractures healed with static interlocking fixation. Two patients needed conversion from static to dynamic interlocking fixation because of inadequate fracture-healing; both progressed to uneventful union. The time to full weight-bearing (average, eleven weeks) was individualized for each patient and depended on the cortical contact of the major fragments, the presence of bridging callus as seen on radiographs, and the extent of other injuries of the ipsilateral lower extremity. No deformation or failure of the static interlocking device developed after early walking with weight-bearing, but fatigue failure of one nail occurred in a non-ambulatory patient who had an intracranial injury. Pain related to soft-tissue irritation by the prominent heads of the interlocking screws, clinically presenting as bursitis or snapping of the iliotibial band, was severe enough in six patients to necessitate removal of either the proximal or the distal screw after union of the fracture. We concluded that static interlocking of intramedullary nails in femoral shaft fractures does not appreciably inhibit the process of healing of the fracture, and that routine conversion to dynamic intramedullary fixation, although occasionally necessary, need not be performed.\r"

Thirty-nine of the nails had been inserted in a fresh fracture, which usually was comminuted; eight had been used for fixation of an osteotomy; nine, for fixation of a non-union; and four, for treatment of a pathological fracture. Several small-diameter intramedullary nails broke at the site of the fracture or non-union. In contrast, the sites of breakage in the interlocking nails were the interlocking holes and the welded junction of the top insertional portion and the proximal slot. Many of the breakages were in patients who had an unstable fracture pattern. The interval between insertion and breakage ranged from one to 120 months.\r"

At a mean length of follow-up of fifty-seven months (range, thirty to ninety-six months), thirty-seven (90 per cent) of the patients were satisfied with the result. Objectively, the results were excellent after thirty-nine arthrodeses (87 per cent), good or fair after five (11 per cent), and poor after one (2 per cent). There was one non-union and one superficial wound infection. At the time of follow-up, no secondary degenerative changes in the associated joints of the hind part of the foot were identified on roentgenograms. The surgical technique appears to be appropriate and effective in the treatment of arthritis of the talocalcaneal joint in adults.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective eight-year study comparing surgical and conservative treatment of acute tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, ninety-two patients in whom a tear had been confirmed either by arthroscopy or by arthrotomy were treated and could be followed. The choice of treatment was determined entirely by whether the result of a pivot-shift test was graded as absent, trace, or mild (non-operative treatment) or as moderate or severe (surgical treatment). Surgical treatment consisted of primary repair of the torn ligament and augmentation with a patellar tendon graft. Twenty-two patients were treated non-operatively, and the results were evaluated after twenty-four to eighty-two months (average, forty-eight months). Seventy patients were treated surgically, and fifty-two of them (approximately 70 per cent) returned for follow-up after twenty-four to 100 months (average, forty-eight months); an additional eighteen patients answered a questionnaire. In the non-operative group, about half of the results were graded as excellent or good and half, as fair or a failure. In the surgical group, all but two of the patients had an excellent or a good result; two patients had a fair result. No result was graded as a failure. The results of this study suggest that when the pivot-shift test is not strongly positive, half of the patients will do reasonably well after treatment with a non-operative program of functional rehabilitation. The patients in this study who had a more unstable knee had far better results after a repair and augmentation procedure than have been previously reported after primary repair alone.\r"

A superficial strip of the quadriceps tendon is pulled distally to fill the void that was left by removal of the patella and to maintain proper length. The musculotendinous portions of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are advanced over this defect in the midline and are sutured to the quadriceps tendon. The average length of follow-up was 13.8 years (range, 3.6 to 31.7 years).

  ".U": "89066854\r", 
  ".W": "Of all tissues of the extremities, muscle is the least tolerant of ischemia. Hypothermia of tissue is considered beneficial for the maintenance of viability of muscle in amputated limbs before surgical replantation, but it has never been established that conventional cooling in an ice bath or its equivalent (temperature of tissue, approximately 1 degree Celsius) is the optimum level of hypothermia for minimizing metabolic derangement in ischemic muscle. In this study, we first defined the time course and level of metabolic derangement of muscle in twenty-eight ischemic hind limbs in cats at 22, 15, 10, 5, and 1 degree Celsius. The levels of adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine and the mean intracellular pH of the muscles in the lateral aspect of the thigh in each limb were monitored with phosphorus nuclear magnetic-resonance spectroscopy over time. The excised muscles from six freshly amputated legs of live humans were then similarly studied to determine whether muscles from cats and from humans exhibit comparable bioenergetic responses to hypothermic ischemia. A final series of ten ischemic hind limbs from cats was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance and muscle biopsy for direct biochemical assay of tissue energy metabolites to compare the metabolic benefits of two different methods of preserving limbs: continuous cooling in an ice bath, and a newly devised protocol for the rapid induction and maintenance of so-called intermediate (10 +/- 5 degrees Celsius) hypothermia of tissue. Ischemic skeletal muscle in cats exhibited a paradoxical metabolic response to extreme cold (1 degree Celsius). The rate of metabolic deterioration progressively declined with decreasing temperature of tissue to 10 degrees Celsius. However, at 5 degrees Celsius, no additional benefit was detected, and at 1 degree Celsius, there was a significant acceleration in the rates of degradation of adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine and in the production of lactate. The rate of degradation of adenosine triphosphate in human ischemic muscle was also faster at 1 degree Celsius than at 10 degrees Celsius. This paradoxical response is apparently due to a severe inhibition of the calcium pump of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle cell at temperatures of less than 5 degrees Celsius. The inhibition permits an efflux of calcium to the myofibrils, which stimulates both glycolysis and the degradation of adenosine triphosphate by myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase.\r"

An above-the-knee amputation was selected by the surgeon for thirty-two of thirty-four non-diabetic limbs and a below-the-knee amputation, for two for which no measurements of pressure were available. Local skin-perfusion pressure was measured distal to the knee before amputation, using a standardized photoelectric technique in 203 limbs and systolic blood-pressure measurements in nineteen. Skin-perfusion pressure was also measured above the knee in seventy-six of the 222 limbs in which a pressure was determined below the knee. These measurements were made available to the surgeon for use as an adjuvant guide to clinical assessment in selecting the appropriate level of amputation. Seventy-four patients (ninety-two amputations) had diabetes and 114 patients (130 amputations) did not. The limbs of the diabetic patients had a significantly higher skin-perfusion pressure at the below-the-knee level (p less than 0.001) than did those of the non-diabetic patients. The ratios of below-the-knee to above-the-knee amputations for the diabetic and non-diabetic patients were 3.8 to one and 1.3 to one (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mechanical properties of the vertebral trabecular bone were determined by subjecting cylindrical specimens to simple compression until failure occurred. The ultimate strength and elastic modulus were determined from load time curves, using constant displacement rate loading. Atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used to determine the weight per cent calcium of each specimen, and quantitative light microscopy was used to determine area fraction bone. Significant positive correlations were found between the observed mechanical properties of the trabecular bone and the equivalent mineral density as measured by computed tomography. Compressive strength (r = 0.720), elastic modulus (r = 0.574), trabecular calcium density (r = 0.780), and area fraction bone (r = 0.579) were all correlated with the equivalent mineral density.\r"

  ".W": "It has been generally assumed that release of antibiotic from methylmethacrylate occurs either from the surface, through pores in the matrix of the cement, or by diffusion through the matrix. In vitro and in vivo studies of the release of antibiotic from cement have produced variable and inconsistent results. In our laboratory, preliminary observations suggested that antibiotic is released from methylmethacrylate by flow through an interconnecting series of voids and cracks in the cement, rather than through diffusion after having been homogeneously distributed throughout the cement. Therefore, experiments were performed to answer the fundamental question of whether the matrix of methylmethacrylate bone cement is permeable to gentamicin. In vivo elution studies were performed on injection-molded rods of methylmethacrylate that had been loaded with two different amounts of gentamicin. The first group of rods contained 0.5 gram of gentamicin for each packet and the second, 1.5 grams for each packet. The rods were embedded subcutaneously in the subcostal region of sheep for three months. Bioassay of sections of the rods, using the tube-diffusion technique of Mitchison and Spicer, showed that the more highly loaded cement had released a significantly greater proportion of gentamicin. This occurred because the more highly loaded cement contained a greater number of defects that contained gentamicin (filled voids and interconnecting cracks). In vitro diffusion studies were also performed, using 0.8-millimeter-thick disks of methylmethacrylate that did not contain antibiotic. Test solutions of either gentamicin or methylene blue were placed in the inner compartments of diffusion chambers. The outer compartments contained tissue-culture medium 199, which was sampled monthly and assayed for gentamicin or methylene blue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The functional interrelationship between biliary cholesterol secretion, sinusoidal lipoprotein cholesterol secretion and bile salt synthesis was studied in the rat. Diosgenin, fructose, and colestipol in the diet were used to, respectively, influence biliary cholesterol output, VLDL production and bile salt synthesis. In the acute bile fistula rat, biliary cholesterol output was 700% increased by diosgenin and 50% decreased by fructose. In the rats fed both diosgenin and fructose, biliary cholesterol secretion was increased only by approximately 200%, whereas biliary bile salts and phospholipid outputs were unchanged. In the isolated perfused liver, VLDL-cholesterol output was 50% reduced by diosgenin alone, but was unchanged following feeding of diosgenin plus fructose. However, the livers of rats fed diosgenin plus fructose exhibited a 700% increase in VLDL-triglyceride production and a 200% increase in VLDL-cholesterol output. A significant reciprocal relationship between VLDL-cholesterol secretion and the coupling ratio of cholesterol to bile salts in bile was observed. Colestipol added to the diet maintained both sinusoidal and biliary cholesterol outputs within the normal range. In the chronic bile fistula rat, colestipol increased bile salt synthesis by 100% while diosgenin and fructose diets had no effect. Similarly, the addition of fructose to the colestipol diet did not decrease bile salt synthesis. These data suggest a reciprocal relationship between biliary cholesterol secretion and hepatic secretion of cholesterol as VLDL particles. The free cholesterol pool used for bile salt synthesis seems functionally unrelated to the pool from which VLDL-cholesterol and biliary cholesterol originate. These findings support the idea that metabolic compartmentalization of hepatic cholesterol is a major determinant of the quantity of cholesterol available for recruitment by the bile salt-dependent biliary cholesterol secretory mechanism.\r"

The diagnosis of a hypersensitivity reaction was corroborated by in vitro rechallenge for each drug (phenytoin, n = 34; phenobarbital, n = 22; carbamazepine, n = 25) when cytotoxicity (% dead cells) exceeded 3 SD above the mean result for controls. Cross-reactivity among the drugs was noted. 7 out of 10 patients who had received all three anticonvulsants had adverse reactions to each. 40 out of 50 patients tested to all three drugs in vitro were positive to each. Adverse reactions were indistinguishable among anti-convulsants. Skin rash (87%), fever (94%), hepatitis (51%), and hematologic abnormalities (51%) were common clinical features of each drug. 62% of reactions involved more than two organs. Cells from patients' parents exhibited in vitro toxicity that was intermediate between values for controls and patients. In vitro testing can help diagnose hypersensitivity to anticonvulsants. Cells from patients may also be used for prospective individualization of therapy to decrease risk of adverse reaction. Cross-reactivity among the major anticonvulsants is common and should be considered before deciding on alternative therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary edema after ascent to altitude is well recognized but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. To determine whether altitude exposure increases lung vascular permeability, we exposed rats to a simulated altitude of approximately 14,500 feet (barometric pressure [Pb] 450 Torr) and measured the pulmonary transvascular escape of radiolabeled 125I-albumin corrected for lung blood content with 51Cr-tagged red blood cells (protein leak index = PLI). Exposures of 24 and 48 h caused significant increases in PLI (2.30 +/- 0.08 and 2.40 +/- 0.06) compared with normoxic controls (1.76 +/- 0.06), but brief hypoxic exposures of 1-13 h produced no increase in PLI, despite comparable increases in pulmonary artery pressure. There were associated increases in gravimetric estimates of lung water in the altitude-exposed groups and perivascular edema cuffs on histologic examination. Normobaric hypoxia (48 h; fractional inspired oxygen concentration [FIO2] = 15%) also increased lung transvascular protein escape and lung water. Dexamethasone has been used to prevent and treat altitude-induced illnesses, but its mechanism of action is unclear. Dexamethasone (0.5 or 0.05 mg/kg per 12 h) started 12 h before and continued during 48 h of altitude exposure prevented the hypoxia-induced increases in transvascular protein escape and lung water. Hemodynamic measurements (mean pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output) were unaffected by dexamethasone, suggesting that its effect was not due to a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure or flow. The role of endogenous glucocorticoid activity was assessed in adrenalectomized rats that showed augmented hypoxia-induced increases in transvascular protein escape, which were prevented by exogenous glucocorticoid replacement. In summary, subacute hypoxic exposures increased pulmonary transvascular protein escape and lung water in rats. Dexamethasone prevented these changes independent of reductions of mean pulmonary artery pressure or flow, whereas adrenalectomy increased pulmonary vascular permeability and edema at altitude. Increases in vascular permeability in hypoxia could contribute to the development of high-altitude pulmonary edema and endogenous glucocorticoids may have an important influence on pulmonary vascular permeability in hypoxia.\r"

SMC and/or collagen layers exerted minimal effects on Na+ transport but impeded the transport of LDL. The presence of an endothelial monolayer markedly reduced the transport of Na+ and LDL. When monocytes were presented to the complete coculture, in the absence of added chemoattractant, one monocyte entered the subendothelial space for every one to three EC present. In contrast, neither collagen nor SMC plus collagen nor EC plus collagen induced comparable monocyte migration. Despite massive migration of monocytes into the coculture, no significant alteration in Na+ transport was observed. LDL transport into the preparation during massive monocyte migration increased modestly, but this was far less than the amount of LDL transported in the absence of an endothelial monolayer. We conclude that (a) the endothelial monolayer was the principal permeability barrier, (b) a substantial migration of monocytes occurred in the absence of added chemoattractant when both EC and SMC were present in the coculture, (c) endothelial barrier function was largely maintained after monocyte migration; and (d) these experiments indicate the need to study all three cell types (monocytes, EC, and SMC) together to understand the complex interactions that occur between these cells.\r"

We show here that the L-428 Hodgkin's cell releases a high molecular weight TGF that competes for the TGF-beta cell membrane receptor but not the TGF-alpha receptor. This growth factor is most active at physiologic pH and is 97% inactivated by acidification. Hodgkin's TGF is also inactivated by proteases and can be preserved by protease inhibitors. The Hodgkin's TGF can be separated from an autocrine growth factor using either column chromatography or electroelution from gels and is shown to have a molecular weight of approximately 350,000. Incubation of the Hodgkin's TGF in SDS releases a 25,000-D protein with reduced biological activity but which cross-reacts with anti-TGF-beta IgG. We propose that L-428 nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease fibrosis is mediated by a potent high molecular weight TGF-beta which, unlike TGF-beta characterized to date, is secreted in a form most active at physiologic pH.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine if assembly of terminal complement components (C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9) and expression of C5b-9 neoantigens occur when PV IgG interacts with human keratinocyte (HuK) cell surface antigens in the presence of a source of complement. Monoclonal antibodies specific for C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, and C5b-9 neoantigens were screened for reactivity to the individual complement components in an assembled complex of human C5b-9 on rabbit red blood cell ghosts. Monoclonal antibodies (tissue culture supernatants) that bound to antigenic determinants accessible in the C5b-9 complex were selected for this study using immunofluorescence methods. HuK treated with PV IgG fixed C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, and C5b-9 neoantigens in a characteristic speckled pattern, while normal IgG did not. Heat inactivation or EDTA treatment of the complement source, or substitution of C2-depleted serum abolished C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, and C5b-9 neoantigen staining. PV IgG and complement also resulted in significant cytotoxicity to cell membranes as assessed using an ethidium bromide-fluorescein diacetate assay. These results suggest that PV IgG will activate the membrane attack complex of the complement system on HuK cell surfaces, resulting in cytotoxicity to cell membranes, further implicating complement in the pathogenesis of pemphigus.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were designed to explore the possibility that human polymorphonuclear leukocyte granule constituents in addition to elastase (HLE) had the potential to cause emphysema. A two-step purification of three serine proteinases was developed. Granule extract proteins were initially separated by dye-ligand affinity chromatography. Fractions eluted were divided into four pools. Hamsters were given a single intratracheal instillation of saline +/- 0.1 mg protein of each pool. While pool 2 contained HLE and cathepsin G, the most dramatic bullous emphysema developed in animals treated with pool 4. The esterase from pool 4, designated proteinase 3 (PR-3) was purified, characterized in vitro, and tested for its ability to cause emphysema. PR-3 is a neutral serine proteinase with isoenzyme forms. Its ability to degrade elastin at pH 6.5 is slightly greater than that of HLE, but it is less active than HLE at pH 7.4 or 8.9. PR-3 has weak activity against azocasein. Its ability to degrade hemoglobin is intermediate to that of HLE and cathepsin G at pH 7.4. PR-3 has no activity against chromogenic substrates specific for HLE or cathepsin G. Its pI is substantially less than HLE or cathepsin G. It is also immunologically distinct from HLE. It induces emphysema in hamsters commensurate with that of HLE. We conclude that PR-3 may be important in the pathogenesis of human emphysema.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase has been recognized as an enzyme that inactivates PAF. We developed a convenient and reproducible method for determining human serum PAF acetylhydrolase activity. The assay was based on measurement of [14C]acetate produced from 1-O-alkyl-2-[14C]-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine upon precipitation of the complex of radioactive substrate and albumin with TCA. The apparent Km value of PAF acetylhydrolase (near the physiological concentration of serum protein) was 1.5 X 10(-4) M PAF. 32 subjects with serum PAF acetylhydrolase deficiency were found among 816 healthy Japanese adults. The low PAF acetylhydrolase activity in the deficient serum might not be due to the presence of enzyme inhibitor. Both the sensitivity to PAF and the metabolism of PAF in platelets from PAF acetylhydrolase-deficient subjects were almost the same as those of normal subjects. Deficiency in serum PAF acetylhydrolase appeared to be transmitted by autosomal recessive heredity among five Japanese families. Among healthy adults, healthy children, and asthmatic children, who were grouped into five classes on the basis of respiratory symptoms (remission, wheezy, mild, moderate, and severe groups), the probability of PAF acetylhydrolase deficiency was significantly higher in groups with severe symptoms (moderate and severe) (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that deficiency of serum PAF acetylhydrolase might be one of the factors leading to severe respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children.\r"

Inhibitors of serine proteases inhibit cellular shape change in response to IM. To further examine the role of cell surface proteases in shape change, adhesion plaque proteins (i.e., preparations of ventral membranes and extracellular matrix) were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin with and without plasminogen. Four discrete zones of lysis were evident in plasminogen gels (indicative of activation of plasminogen) from control adhesion plaques: one inconspicuous zone with a Mr approximately 150 kD, another at approximately 115 kD, and a doublet at approximately 35-32 kD. Another diffuse zone of lysis centered around Mr approximately 70 kD and contained a defined band of approximately 56 kD. Adhesion plaques contained most of the plasminogen activators (PA). 5 min after IM treatment, the Mr approximately 150- and approximately 115-kD PA were increased in activity. Vasopressin (VP), which prevented shape change and adhesion loss when added along with IM, inhibited the increase in these PA. Preincubation with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) totally inhibited the IM-inducible shape change and adhesion loss. Activation of plasminogen throughout the gels revealed multiple protease resistant bands that markedly increased with IM treatment (maximal at 45 min). These may represent focal control mechanisms. uPA thus may mediate focal proteolysis, which results in shape change and decreased adhesion.\r"

For evaluation of this hypothesis cellular influx kinetics (V0) of [3H]-oleate were examined in isolated rat jejunal mucosal cells. With increasing unbound oleate concentration in the medium V0 was saturable (Km = 93 nM; Vmax = 2.1 nmol X min-1 per 10(6) cells) and temperature dependent with an optimum at 37 degrees C. Pretreatment of the cells with a monospecific antibody to MFABP significantly inhibited V0 of oleate, other long-chain fatty acids, and D-monopalmitin, but not of L-alanine. Moreover, in the in vivo system of isolated perfused jejunal segments the physiologic significance of MFABP in the directed overall intestinal absorption process of fatty acids was documented. In the presence of the anti-MFABP oleate absorption was markedly reduced, whereas uptake of L-alanine remained unaltered. By antibody inhibition studies it was suggested that this membrane carrier also reveals transport competence for various other long-chain fatty acids, D-monopalmitin, L-lysophosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. These data support the hypothesis that absorption of fatty acids is mediated by a fatty acid binding membrane protein.\r"

We found that a variety of protease inhibitors suppressed the replication of the SA-11 strain of rotavirus in MA-104 cell cultures. Three of these compounds, leupeptin, pentamidine, and bis (5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl) methane (BABIM) also restricted the intestinal replication of the murine strain of rotavirus when protease inhibitor and virus were administered simultaneously to suckling mice. Repeated administration of BABIM resulted in significantly reduced levels of intestinal rotaviral antigen even if administration of the compound was begun as late as 48 h after viral inoculation. Additionally, BABIM-treated animals had significantly less intestinal replication of rotavirus than did placebo-treated controls when placed in a heavily rotavirus-contaminated environment. The use of protease inhibitors represents a novel approach to the control of this important gastrointestinal pathogen and is a potential modality for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by other enteric viruses, for which proteolytic cleavage is necessary for efficient replication.\r"

Coronary sinus and arterial catheters were inserted in nine healthy trained male subjects (mean age, 25 +/- 6 (SD) years). Dual carbon-labeled isotopes were infused, and substrate oxidation was quantitated by measuring myocardial production of 14CO2. Supine cycle ergometer exercise was performed at 40% of the subject's maximal O2 uptake. With exercise there was a significant increase in the arterial lactate level (P less than 0.05). A highly significant positive correlation was observed between the lactate level and the isotopic lactate extraction (r = 0.93; P less than 0.001). The myocardial isotopic lactate uptake increased from 34.9 +/- 6.5 mumol/min at rest to 120.4 +/- 36.5 mumol/min at 5 min of exercise (P less than 0.005). The 14CO2 data demonstrated that 100.4 +/- 3.5% of the lactate extracted as determined by isotopic analysis underwent oxidative decarboxylation. Myocardial glucose uptake also increased significantly with exercise (P less than 0.04). The [14C]glucose data showed that only 26.0 +/- 8.5% of the glucose extracted underwent immediate oxidation at rest, and during exercise the percentage being oxidized increased to 52.6 +/- 7.3% (P less than 0.01). This study demonstrates for the first time in humans an increase in myocardial oxidation of exogenous glucose and lactate during moderate intensity exercise.\r"

In guinea pigs given a constant infusion of isoproterenol, 0.15 mg/(kg.h), down-regulation of total receptor number occurred more quickly and to a greater extent in the MNL than in the heart. We also compared receptor sequestration after aortic constriction-induced acute heart failure. Negligible sequestration (9%) of beta-adrenergic receptors occurred in the MNL of animals treated in this manner, whereas the number of receptors in the sarcolemmal fraction decreased 61%. This selective sequestration of cardiac receptors may result from the action of high concentrations of norepinephrine (which is selective for beta 1 over beta 2 receptors) present at sympathetic nerve-cardiac cell synapses. We conclude that although receptor redistribution occurs similarly in MNL and heart in response to a circulating nonselective agonist, beta-adrenergic receptor redistribution may occur selectively in the heart in response to such stimuli as aortic constriction-induced acute heart failure that activate the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an active oxygen metabolite that may induce intimal injury by cytolytic attack or by inducing biochemical and functional alterations in the endothelial cells (EC); however, mechanisms involved in noncytolytic perturbation of EC are largely unknown. We found that H2O2 stimulated the synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by primary cultures of bovine pulmonary artery endothelium (BPAEC) and by human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVEC). In each cell type the incorporation of [3H]acetate into [3H-acetyl]PAF was concentration- and time-dependent and was temporally dissociated from severe plasma membrane disruption and cytolytic cell injury; the newly synthesized PAF remained associated with the EC. H2O2 caused permeabilization of EC to 45Ca2+ and an increase in intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that a transmembrane Ca2+ flux is the signal that initiates PAF synthesis. H2O2 also induced the endothelial cell-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to HUVEC monolayers. This response was rapid, with an onset within minutes and a subsequent time course that paralleled the time course of PAF accumulation, and was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ but not on de novo protein synthesis. These studies demonstrate that H2O2 can induce two rapid activation responses of endothelium, PAF synthesis and EC-dependent neutrophil adhesion, events that may be important in physiologic and pathologic inflammation.\r"

HRIF does not affect release initiated by other secretagogues such as allergen, anti-IgE, C5a, Con A, and phorbol myristate acetate. HRIF requires a preincubation with the cells for 5-10 min for maximal inhibition, and this effect is not abolished by washing the cells after the preincubation. The biological activity of HRIF is protease-sensitive, neuraminidase-resistant, and relatively heat-stable. HRIF can be distinguished from HRF by a lower apparent molecular mass (8,000-10,000 D).\r"

Substance P stimulated cough in very low concentrations (10(-17)-10(-16) M). In a second study where the investigator did not know whether substance P or diluent alone was aerosolized, substance P (10(-16) M) caused cough. Leucine-thiorphan (10(-5) M) and phosphoramidon (10(-5) M) potentiated substance P-induced cough; NEP inhibitors also potentiated capsaicin-induced cough significantly. These findings suggest that substance P is a potent stimulator of cough responses, that capsaicin-induced cough is mediated by substance P or another similar neuropeptide, and that cough responses are modulated by endogenous neutral endopeptidase.\r"

Aminopyrine N-demethylation (ABT), galactose elimination (GBT), and serum bile acids (SBA) were determined in vivo. The livers were then characterized hemodynamically: intrahepatic shunting (IHS) was determined by microspheres and sinusoidal capillarization by measuring the extravascular albumin space (EVA) by a multiple indicator dilution technique. The intrinsic clearance was determined by assaying the activity of the rate-limiting enzymes in vitro. Hepatocellular volume (HCV) was measured by morphometry. ABT and SBA, but not GBT, differentiated cirrhotic from normal liver. IHS ranged from normal to 10%; all cirrhotic livers showed evidence of sinusoidal capillarization (reduced EVA). The cirrhotic livers showed a bimodal distribution of HCV, HCV being decreased in 50% of the cirrhotic livers. Multivariate analysis showed EVA and portal flow to be the main determinants of microsomal (ABT) and cytosolic (GBT) clearance function; SBA, by contrast, were determined solely by IHS. We conclude that sinusoidal capillarization is the main determinant of hepatic clearance, while serum bile acids reflect intrahepatic shunting. These findings emphasize the importance of alterations of hepatic nutritional flow to explain reduced clearance function in cirrhosis of the liver.\r"

These studies used [3H]water and 125I-cellobiose-labeled low density lipoproteins to quantitate absolute rates of cholesterol acquisition in vivo by the fetus of the rat. Preliminary studies demonstrated that [3H]water administered intravenously to the mother rapidly equilibrated with the body pool of water in the fetus and that 22-microgram atoms of H from the water pool were incorporated into each micromole of newly synthesized cholesterol. After administration of [3H]water to pregnant rats, the rates of sterol synthesis per 100 g of whole body weight were severalfold higher in the fetus than in the dams. Individual organs of the dam such as the liver, however, had much higher synthetic rates than those in the fetus. When maternal hepatic cholesterol synthesis was suppressed by cholesterol feeding, newly synthesized cholesterol disappeared from the maternal blood yet there was essentially no change in the rate of appearance of newly synthesized sterol in the fetus, placenta, and fetal membranes. The placenta did take up low density lipoproteins at rates equal to about one-third of that seen in the maternal liver, but none of the apolipoprotein or cholesterol was transferred to the fetus. These studies indicate that the rat fetus receives little or no cholesterol from the mother but, rather, satisfies its need for cholesterol during fetal development through local synthesis. Furthermore, the fetal membranes appear to be an important site for sterol synthesis in the fetal compartment.\r"

Volume (JV), chloride (JCl) and glucose (JG) fluxes in these perfused PTs were compared with those determined using ATF alone. In separate experiments, perfused nephrons were examined with electron and immunoelectron microscopy. After exposure to BJP1 or BLG, JV, JCl, and JG were less (P less than 0.05) than corresponding control fluxes. Cell damage of these perfused PTs, along with cellular debris in the distal tubules, was prominent. The PT lysosomes often appeared atypical and contained crystals. In contrast, perfusion with BJP2, BJP3, or MYG did not alter JV, JCl, or JG. These findings were corroborated by the normal ultrastructure of these PTs despite immunohistochemical evidence of endocytosis of the BJPs. Isoelectric point, molecular form, and isotype were not factors associated with PT damage. In addition, proteins with pI less than 7.4 precipitated in the distal nephron, forming acellular casts. Thus, certain nephrotoxic LMWPs damaged the PT, while others precipitated in the distal tubule, obstructing the nephron. These two pathogenetic mechanisms may independently be responsible for tubulointerstitial nephropathy of LMWPs in humans.\r"

  ".W": "The metabolism of radioiodinated apo B-100 in large VLDL from normal and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, with diameters exceeding 450 A, was studied in corresponding recipient rabbits. In both cases approximately 87% of the particles contained apolipoprotein (apo) E (B,E particles). In normal rabbits, apo B in these B,E particles was removed from blood plasma much more rapidly than apo B in B,E particles in smaller VLDL and few of the large B,E particles were converted to lipoproteins of higher density. In WHHL rabbits, approximately 60% of the apo B in B,E particles in large VLDL was removed at a comparably rapid rate, but an appreciable fraction of the remainder, which was removed slowly, was converted to particles of higher density, as are the B,E particles in smaller VLDL. From kinetic analysis of these and other data, an hypothesis was formulated from which it is estimated that apo B in large VLDL accounts for 18 and 41% of apo B transport in normal and WHHL rabbits, respectively, despite the fact that these lipoproteins contain less than 5% of the apo B in total VLDL. Failure to account for the contribution of large VLDL to VLDL turnover may lead to serious underestimation of total apo B transport in the blood.\r"

Proximal convoluted tubules were labeled over apical plasma membrane invaginations, and in the initial part of the thin descending limb, apical and basolateral plasma membranes were moderately stained. Thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules were apically stained although the intensity was greater in the distal convoluted tubule. Collecting duct principal cells were virtually unlabeled, but intercalated cells had intense staining with an apical, basolateral or diffuse pattern in the cortex, and exclusively apical staining in the medulla. These results (a) show the presence of an H+ATPase in the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule that may contribute to H+ transport in this segment; (b) provide direct evidence that the intercalated cell contains most of the H+ATPase detectable in the collecting duct, supporting its proposed role in H+ transport; (c) demonstrate that subpopulations of cortical intercalated cells have opposite polarities of an H+ATPase, consistent with the presence of both proton- and bicarbonate-secreting cells; and (d) suggest a role for the H+ATPase in acid/base regulation or H+ transport in segments other than the collecting duct and the proximal tubule.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of adenosine on the human His-Purkinje system (HPS) were studied in nine patients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block. Adenosine had minimal effect on the control HPS cycle length, but in the presence of isoproterenol increased it from 906 +/- 183 to 1,449 +/- 350 ms, P less than 0.001. Aminophylline, a competitive adenosine antagonist, completely abolished this antiadrenergic effect of adenosine. In isolated guinea pig hearts with surgically induced AV block, isoproterenol decreased the HPS rate by 36%, whereas in the presence of 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenyl-xanthine, a potent adenosine antagonist, the HPS rate decreased by 48% and was associated with an increased release of adenosine. Therefore, by blocking the effects of adenosine at the receptor level, the physiologic negative feedback mechanism by which adenosine antagonizes the effects of catecholamines was uncoupled. The results of this study indicate that adenosine's effects on the human HPS are primarily antiadrenergic and are thus consistent with the concept of accentuated antagonism. These effects of adenosine may serve as a counterregulatory metabolic response that improves the O2 supply-demand ratio perturbed by enhanced sympathetic tone. Some catecholamine-mediated ventricular arrhythmias that occur during ischemia or enhanced adrenergic stress may be due to an imbalance in this negative feedback system.\r"

  ".W": "Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent protein cofactor to the anticoagulant, activated protein C (APC). This study examines the inhibition of human protein S anticoagulant activity by prothrombin. In the absence of protein S, the anticoagulant activity of APC measured in a Factor Xa recalcification time, was comparable using normal or plasma adsorbed with Al(OH)3. Protein S was an effective cofactor to APC in Al(OH)3-adsorbed plasma, but was significantly less active in normal plasma. Analysis of the difference in the two plasmas revealed that normal plasma contained an inhibitor to the anticoagulant activity of protein S that was removed by Al(OH)3 adsorption. Purification of this inhibitory activity demonstrated that it was mediated by the vitamin K-dependent protein, prothrombin. Prothrombin purified by conventional techniques caused immediate, dose-dependent inhibition of the cofactor activity of protein S in the presence of phospholipids or platelets, but had no effect on the anticoagulant activity of APC. The inhibition was demonstrable using a Factor Xa recalcification time, and studies of the rates of inactivation of purified Factor Va. Increasing concentrations of protein S overcame the inhibition by prothrombin and kinetic analysis of the interaction demonstrated that prothrombin acted as a competitive inhibitor to protein S. Immunoabsorption of prothrombin from plasma using immobilized antiprothrombin antibodies was associated with the complete removal of the protein S inhibitory activity. We conclude that the anticoagulant activity of protein S is modulated by prothrombin and that this may represent another regulatory mechanism of the natural anticoagulant system.\r"

  ".W": "A new inborn error in bile acid synthesis, manifest in identical infant twins as severe intrahepatic cholestasis, is described involving the delta 4-3-oxosteroid 5 beta-reductase catalyzed conversion of the key intermediates, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one for chenodeoxycholic and cholic acid synthesis, to the respective 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta (H) products. This defect was detected by fast atom bombardment ionization-mass spectrometry from an elevated excretion and predominance of taurine conjugated unsaturated hydroxy-oxo-bile acids. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed these to be 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic and 7 alpha,12 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholenoic acids (75-92% of total). Fasting serum bile acid concentrations were greater than 37 mumol/liter; chenodeoxycholic acid was the major bile acid, but significant amounts of allo(5 alpha-H)-bile acids (approximately 30%) were present. Biliary bile acid concentration was less than 2 mumol/liter and consisted of chenodeoxycholic, allo-chenodeoxycholic, and allo-cholic acids. These biochemical findings, which were identical in both infants, indicate a defect in bile acid synthesis involving the conversion of the delta 4-3-oxo-C27 intermediates into the corresponding 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta(H)-structures, a reaction that is catalyzed by a delta 4-3-oxosteroid-5 beta reductase enzyme. This defect resulted in markedly reduced primary bile acid synthesis and concomitant accumulation of delta 4-3-oxo-and allo-bile acids. These findings indicate a pathway in bile acid synthesis whereby side chain oxidation can occur despite incomplete alterations to the steroid nucleus, and lend support for an active delta 4-3-oxosteroid 5 alpha-reductase catalyzing the conversion of the delta 4-3-oxosteroid intermediates to the respective 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha(H)-structures.\r"

In order to further confirm that there are differences in transport properties between villus and crypt cells, we have separated villus from crypt cells, using calcium chelations techniques, and determined the distribution of Na:H and Cl:HCO3 exchange activity on brush border membrane and basolateral membrane preparations from these two cell populations. Separation of cells was determined utilizing alkaline phosphatase and maltase activity as a marker of villus cells and thymidine kinase activity as a marker of crypt cells. Utilizing these techniques, we were able to sequentially collect cells along the villus-crypt axis. Na-stimulated glucose and alanine uptake in brush border membrane vesicles diminished from the villus to the crypt region in the sequentially collected cells fractions, further suggesting separation of these cells. Brush border and basolateral membranes were then prepared from cells from the villus and crypt areas, utilizing a continuous sucrose gradient. In the villus cells, Na:H exchange activity was found associated with both the brush border and basolateral membrane, whereas, in crypt cells, Na:H exchange activity was only found on the basolateral membrane. Cl:HCO3 exchange activity was found only on the brush border membrane, in both villus and crypt cells. These studies suggest functional heterogeneity in ion transport between villus and crypt cells.\r"

We have previously described two apparently unrelated subjects with partial HPRT deficiency, G.S. and D.B., who have a mutant form of HPRT with remarkably similar alterations in physical and kinetic properties. The mutation in G.S. is a serine to leucine substitution at amino acid 110 as determined by amino acid sequence analysis. This mutant enzyme has been designated HPRTLondon. We have examined HPRT cDNA from D.B. using two different methods to determine if the similar properties of mutant HPRT from these two subjects are the result of a common mutation. HPRT cDNA clones were obtained by routine cloning techniques and by polymerase chain reaction amplification of single-stranded cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA derived from subject D.B. Dideoxynucleotide sequencing revealed a single mutation, a C to T transition at bp 329 in clones generated by both methods. This mutation in D.B. predicts the identical amino acid substitution described in HPRTLondon. A C to T nucleotide transition at 329 in D.B. creates an Hpa I site in exon 4 of the HPRT gene. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from lymphoblasts derived from G.S. and D.B. revealed that both have this additional Hpa I site, indicating that the similarly altered protein sequence is due to the identical transition in the HPRT gene.\r"

By quantitative ELISA, anti-La sera from patients with various connective tissue diseases were shown to react with La fusion proteins containing different regions of the La molecule. Two recombinant La fragments containing the carboxyl three-fourths and the middle one-third of the La sequence, respectively, bound higher levels of anti-La antibodies than the two fragments representing the amino and carboxyl terminals. Purified bovine La protein effectively competed for the binding of human autoantibodies to three of the four recombinant La fusion proteins, suggesting similarity in antigenic presentation between the La epitopes in these fusion proteins and the native La molecule. Immunoadsorption experiments showed that most anti-bovine La protein antibodies were removed from a human serum by affinity chromatography by using the fusion protein containing the carboxyl three-fourths of the La sequence, thus supporting the results obtained by quantitative solid phase ELISA. These studies demonstrate that anti-La autoantibodies recognize three La fragments representing separate nonoverlapping regions of the La sequence and are compatible with a mechanism of autoantibody production based on an immune response to the entire self-protein molecule.\r"

We used the Amersham RIA kit for the minor cleavage fragment of C3 produced during C activation (C3a), and a new assay utilizing mAb to C3b to measure the fraction of active C3 in a C source after the IC activate C. These mAb, along with a mAb to human IgG, allowed us to measure IC stoichiometries. The efficiency of C3 turnover by the IC is quite high, and under conditions of Ab excess, the maximum number of IgG bound per dsDNA corresponds to 1 IgG/20 to 30 base pairs. The maximum number of C3b found in the IC corresponds to less than 1 C3b/IgG, and the vast majority of the captured C3b is bound to the IgG, and not to the DNA. We identified several IC that consumed large amounts of C3, and captured large amounts of C3b, but did not bind to human E via C3b receptors (C receptor type 1). This finding suggests that the ability of IC to bind to human E depends upon the number and distribution of captured C3b molecules and the conformation and size of the DNA Ag, which reflects the need for multivalent binding between several properly arrayed C3b and a \"cluster\" of C receptor type 1 on the human E membrane. IC that activate C3 but do not bind to E would presumably \"escape\" the E IC clearance mechanism, but could deposit in susceptible organs and tissues and play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE because of their potential to generate the inflammatory products of C activation.\r"

CRP has been shown to bind to chromatin and nucleosome core particles. However, CRP does not bind to DNA and there is conflicting evidence regarding the binding of CRP to histones. In the present study, binding of CRP to chromatin was confirmed by ELISA using chromatin bound to microtiter wells. When chromatin depleted of histone H1 was used in the same assay, no CRP binding was detected. Similar results were observed using a competitive inhibition ELISA. These results indicate an important role for H1 in the binding of CRP to chromatin. Further studies were done to characterize the binding of CRP to purified individual histones. CRP binding to histones was demonstrated first by blotting. Calf thymus histones were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 125I-CRP. CRP bound to H1 and H2A and to a lesser extent to H2B. Non-specific binding to H3 was seen and no binding to H4 was observed. CRP binding to purified individual histones was tested by ELISA. Essentially identical results were seen to those obtained by blotting. CRP binding to the H2A-H2B complex was observed as well as reactivity with trypsin-resistant fragments of H2A, H2B, and H3. By blotting and by ELISA all CRP reactions were blocked by PC and EDTA indicating binding through the calcium-dependent PC-binding site on CRP. These studies further characterize the nature of the binding of CRP to chromatin and histones and show that the presence of H1 on chromatin is required for CRP binding.\r"

Many mAb that bind to human neutrophils react with the oligosaccharide lacto-N-fucopentaose III (CD15 antibodies). These antibodies, as well as several other widely used mAb reactive with human neutrophils, were employed to detect phosphoproteins present on these cells. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent gel electrophoresis of proteins from neutrophils labeled with [gamma-32P]ATP revealed a 170 to 190-kDa phosphoprotein specifically reactive with CD15 antibodies. No phosphoproteins were immunoprecipitated by CD11 or CD18 mAb. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 170- to 190-kDa protein showed that it contained predominantly phosphotyrosine and a low level of phosphoserine. Recently, it was shown that this phosphoprotein is one of the major substrates of ecto-protein kinase activity on human neutrophils. The roles for the 170- to 190-kDa phosphoprotein and the ecto-protein kinase in neutrophil function remain to be determined.\r"

  ".U": "89067511\r", 
  ".W": "It is shown that a mAb specific for the human 40-kDa FcR (FcRII) leads to activation of human monocytic cells but that extensive cross-linking of the receptor is required. Calcium mobilization can be induced in immature monocytic cells (undifferentiated U937 cells) and peripheral blood monocytes with an intact IgG1 anti-FcRII antibody (CIKM5) but not by F(ab')2 fragments of this antibody. The intact antibody can bind in a tripartite manner by its two F(ab') sites and its Fc-binding site whereas the F(ab')2 fragments of this antibody can only bind in a divalent fashion. A rise in intracellular free calcium ion concentration occurs when F(ab')2 fragments are cross-linked with F(ab')2 anti-mouse Ig indicating that more extensive cross-linking of FcRII is required rather than an obligatory requirement for an Fc-FcRII interaction. Calcium mobilization in response to intact or cross-linked F(ab')2 fragments of CIKM5 is associated with superoxide production only in IFN-gamma-primed peripheral blood monocytes and IFN-gamma differentiated U937 cells indicating that the activation signal produced via FcRII is inadequate to fully stimulate non-\"primed\" cells. A second mAb reactive with FcRII (2E1) does not cause calcium mobilization in monocytes or U937 cells, and partially blocks the effects of CIKM5. 2E1 also blocks CIKM5 superoxide production in IFN-gamma-primed monocytes and differentiated U937 cells. This may be explained in part by the fact that 2E1 is an IgG2a antibody and can only participate in bipartite binding with FcRII. When 2E1 is cross-linked with F(ab')2 anti-mouse Ig there is a small calcium response. This does not cause superoxide generation in IFN-primed monocytes but does do so in IFN-gamma differentiated U937 cells. FcRII is also expressed on granulocytes and some B cells but the effects of cross-linking the receptor on these cells differ from those seen in monocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To map the location of hepatitis B core and e Ag (HBcAg and HBeAg) on the hepatitis B virus core particle, we produced and analyzed four synthetic peptides which correspond to the most hydrophilic regions of the core P22 protein. Each peptide was tested in an ELISA for the ability to inhibit the binding between rHBcAg or rHBeAg and either polyclonal or monoclonal anti-HBc or anti-HBe antibodies. The former comprised 20 antisera positive for anti-HBc (anti-HBs and anti-HBe negative) and five antisera positive for anti-HBe and anti-HBc; the latter included three anti-HBc mAb developed in independent laboratories: G6F5, C51B10, and F8, as well as two anti-HBe mAb, E2 and E6. These experiments revealed the presence of a major HBcAg epitope expressed on C3, a peptide which covers amino acids 107-118 and reacted with all polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies tested. Another peptide, C2, sequence 73-85, reacted with 26% of human antisera but none of the anti-HBc mAb. None of the peptides seemed to express HBeAg activity because they do not cause any significant inhibition of the HBeAg/anti-HBe reaction. These data indicate the expression of an immunodominant HBcAg determinant on a linear dodecapeptide and argue against a strict conformation dependency of this Ag.\r"

  ".W": "The genes for the fourth complement component (C4) and sex-limited protein (Slp) of the mouse exhibit a high degree of sequence homology and have probably been derived by recent gene duplication from a common ancestor gene, but their mode of expression is greatly different in most standard mouse strains. Although the C4 gene is constitutively expressed, the Slp gene is expressed only under the influence of androgens or not expressed at all. To map the transcriptional regulatory domains that are responsible for the difference in the promoter activity between the mouse C4 and Slp genes, we constructed various hybrid promoters from the 5'-flanking DNA of the C4 and Slp genes of the FM strain and tested for their transcriptional activity. The hybrid promoters were inserted into the HindIII site located immediately upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene of the plasmid pSVOcat. The expression of CAT was assayed in transiently transfected HepG2 cells and in permanently transfected Ltk- cells. The transcriptional regulatory region responsible for the difference between the C4 and Slp gene expression was mapped within the 5'-flanking region of about 400 nucleotides near the promoters of the C4 and Slp genes. By S1 mapping analysis, it was shown that the CAT activities expressed in transfected cells were due to the transcripts correctly initiated from the promoter of the C4 or Slp genes in the chimeric constructs.\r"

In all diagnostic assays designed to detect a particular retrovirus, it was necessary to include a hybridization step, because sequences (endogenous or exogenous) homologous to certain primers were present in most human DNA preparations and yielded discrete products, sometimes of the predicted molecular weight, after amplification. These products could be discriminated by hybridization from amplified prototype proviral sequences. The intensity of the signal generated after hybridization was proportional to input target DNA, an observation making it feasible to quantitatively measure the proviral load in a DNA sample.\r"

Amplified products were detected by gel electrophoresis and by dot-blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Using one or both of the primer pairs and associated probes, we found 46 different tissue culture isolates of CMV that were positive; no reaction products were detected when the same primers and probes were used to amplify other herpes family viruses or human genomic DNA. Urine samples from 44 congenitally infected infants were positive when tested with one or both primer pairs and probes. When compared with tissue culture, detection by gel electrophoresis provided a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 100%, and a predictive value of a positive result of 100%. Dot-blot analysis raised the sensitivity to 100%. We conclude that PCR amplification may be a valuable tool for diagnosing congenital CMV infection.\r"

CMV DNA was detected in the blood of 14 of 27 patients with AIDS and one of six patients who were infected with human immunodeficiency virus but who did not have AIDS. Normal CMV-seropositive or -seronegative individuals did not have CMV DNA detected in their blood. The CMV PCR was more sensitive than the standard culture assay, can be completed in one to two days, uses only 20 microL of blood, and may be useful for rapidly detecting CMV in clinical specimens.\r"

Understanding the mechanism responsible for the conversion of Cp33-37 to Sp33-37 may explain scrapie agent replication. Cp33-37 was extracted from normal hamster brain and purified 2700-fold by an immunoaffinity method. Both Cp33-37 purified from normal hamster brain and Sp33-37 purified from scrapie-affected hamster brain had apparent masses of 33-37 kilodaltons and displayed microheterogeneity characteristic of glycoproteins. Cp33-37 was completely digested by proteinase K under conditions that resulted in conversion of Sp33-37 to the protease-resistant fragment PrP27-30. Cp33-37 did not cause scrapie when inoculated intracerebrally into hamsters. Fractions containing purified Sp33-37 had average titers of greater than 10(11) LD50 of the scrapie agent/mg of protein; these titers were not diminished by proteinase K. These results indicate that altered sensitivity to proteolysis in vitro reflects an intrinsic difference between Sp33-37 and Cp33-37.\r"

The immunogenicity and efficacy of the H1N1 reassortant vaccine were also compared with those of the trivalent inactivated virus vaccine. Each reassortant vaccine was satisfactorily attenuated. The 50% human infectious dose was 10(4.9) for ca H1N1, 10(5.4) for ah H1N1, 10(6.4) for ca H3N2, and 10(6.5) TCID50 for ah H3N2 reassortant virus. Within a subtype, the immunogenicities of ah and ca vaccines were comparable. Five to seven weeks after vaccination, volunteers were challenged with homologous wild-type influenza A virus. The magnitude of shedding of virus after challenge was greater than 100-fold less in H1N1 vaccinees and greater than 10-fold less in H3N2 vaccinees compared with unimmunized controls. The vaccines were equally efficacious, as indicated by an 86%-100% reduction in illness. Thus, the ah A/Mallard/New York/6750/78 and the ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 reassortant viruses are comparable.\r"

Although school records were nonuniform, mumps immunization status was correct, compared with provider-verified records, in at least 85% of both cases and controls. Parental reports were much less reliable. The cost of the outbreak was estimated at $154/case. Receiving mumps vaccine at a vaccine clinic held after the outbreak had peaked was associated with a decrease in risk of mumps disease.

  ".W": "Nationwide epidemiological surveys of Kawasaki disease have been conducted nine times in Japan since 1970. By the end of 1986, 83,857 (male:female ratio, 1.4) cases were reported. We summarize the results of these surveys, especially the latest survey of cases from January 1985 to December 1986. There were three epidemic years - 1979, 1982, and 1986. The ratios of the number of patients diagnosed in each of those years to the number in the preceding year were 2.0, 2.4, and 1.7, respectively. The last epidemic started in a metropolitan area of Tokyo in December 1985 and propagated northwards and southwards to involve almost all of the country in six months. The age-specific incidence curve showed a unimodal peak at nine to 11 months of age. The proportion of sibling cases was approximately 2%. The epidemiological pictures suggested that the disease was caused by an unknown biologic agent that is common in the community and that spreads easily among very young children.\r"

C. tertium is an unusual Clostridium because it is resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics and to metronidazole but is susceptible to vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. It is possible that use of third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime) for treating febrile episodes in the absence of any selective intestinal decontamination with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin may have resulted in selection for C. tertium in our patients.\r"

Of a number of clinical and demographic variables studied, only catheterization was significantly related to acute renal inflammation. Acute cystitis was uncommon, but each case was associated with inflammation of at least one kidney. The majority of kidneys showing acute inflammation (21 [68%] of 31) were not accompanied by acute pyelitis. Acute renal inflammation with or without pelvic inflammation is a common finding in nursing home patients dying with urethral catheters in place. This finding provides additional support for the development of alternatives to the indwelling urethral catheter.\r"

These BAER abnormalities were demonstrated in 62 per cent of insulin-controlled diabetics and in 33 per cent o patients treated by diet, or peroral drugs. No alterations in brainstem responses were observed in patients with latent diabetes.

Unilateral jugular vein ligation was performed in 10 animals and bilaterally in 10. Ten animals were controls. The BSER to clicks at 20 db above hearing thresholds before and 6 hours following ligation of one or both jugular veins were recorded. No change in the hearing threshold was observed following jugular vein(s) ligation. However, prolongation of the I-III and III-IV interpeak intervals were observed following both unilateral and bilateral jugular vein ligation. The results suggest that BSER monitoring may be useful in the early detection of brainstem compression following jugular vein ligation in head and neck surgery.\r"

The application of antibodies against mumps, measles and rubella antigens showed the expression of the relevant viral antigens in the large cells of the resorption lacunae, in the vascular connective tissue, and in osteocytes, osteoclasts and chondrocytes, present in or around the otospongiotic areas. In the sclerotic stage only the perivascular connective tissue and chondrocytes have expressed viral antigens whereas IgG was restricted to the osteocytes of the sclerotic focus and to the residual perivascular tissue. Two footplates with postinflammatory sclerosis serving as controls revealed only IgG in some chondrocytes. Healthy footplates showed neither a deposition of antibodies nor any expression of viral antigens. These results favour a viral aetiology of otosclerosis as an inflammatory vascular reaction of the otic capsule initiated or caused by the viruses of measles, rubella and mumps.\r"

It was given orally for six months to both patients, following administration of the traditional parenteral antibiotic courses, and in each case the disease has been extinguished. We therefore recommend that the management of patients shown to have malignant otitis externa should include strict diabetic control, regular local aural toilet, gentamicin ear drops and a six week course of parenteral antipseudomonal antibiotic agents (usually gentamicin and azlocillin) together with metronidazole to cover any anaerobic element in the infection. This regimen should be followed by a six month course of oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg b.d.). Indium scans should be used to monitor recovery. We believe that this regimen can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients suffering from malignant otitis externa with cranial nerve involvement.\r"

The patients with intact tonsils at vaccination did not develop higher antibody response than did those tonsillectomised prior to vaccination. On the contrary, in the case of pneumococcus type 6A, the IgM antibody response in tonsillectomised patients was significantly higher than that in patients with intact tonsils at vaccination (p = 0.021). Thus, the present study did not support the notion that tonsillectomy affects antibody response against pneumococcal vaccination. The palatine tonsils' role as an immunologically reactive organ is also discussed.\r"

Asthma may be mediated by mast cell reactions and the commonest allergen to degranulate mast cells is house dust mite. Mast cells have been shown to be degranulated in nasal polyps. This study looks at thirty-six patients who had nasal polypectomy and of whom fourteen were asthmatic to see if histamine was released from polyp tissue and peripheral blood when they were challenged with antihuman IgE and extracts of house dust mite and mixed grass pollens. These results were compared with skin tests to these allergens. A release of above 15 per cent of the total histamine was considered positive. Eight patients released histamine from polyp tissue but only three patients released histamine with both anti IgE and allergen extracts. The release from blood compared well with positive skin tests (p greater than 0.05 corrected chi square). Although allergy may cause mast cell degranulation in polyp tissue, this study suggests that it is unlikely to be a common cause of nasal polyps.\r"

  ".W": "The clinician is almost entirely dependent on the histopathologist to accurately diagnose minor salivary gland tumours, but in some cases the histological interpretation of the specimen is very difficult. Recently it has been demonstrated using immunohistochemical techniques that S-100 protein is present in some salivary gland tissues and its localization has been used as an aid in the differentiation of major salivary gland tumours. To assess its value in the diagnosis of minor salivary gland tumours it was localized in sections from 15 such tumours using both a standard peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) and a newly developed immunogold-silver staining sequence (IGSS) technique. Strong staining for S-100 protein was seen in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the cellular areas and also in the cells in the chondroid and myxoid areas of pleomorphic adenomas. Generally the staining was more intense and widespread with the IGSS method. No staining was observed in any of the other tumour types. We conclude that S-100 protein localization is a valuable aid in the differentiation of minor salivary gland tumours. Furthermore, the IGSS method enables more sensitive 'reading' of the staining reaction.\r"

In view of recent advances in the diagnosis of lymphoma, a retrospective histopathological review has been undertaken to place all patients in standardized classifications for morphology (the working formulation) and immunology (Kiel). This resulted in a change of diagnosis from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in four. The histopathology of these four cases, and the implication of such changed diagnoses are discussed. Of the 20 patients confirmed as having non-Hodgkin's ENL, 16 had primary ENL and four had an ENL focus secondary to disease elsewhere. Three patients in this series had an initial diagnosis made of another malignancy, but histopathological review prior to treatment changed the diagnosis to ENL. Details of presentation, pretreatment evaluation, immunohistochemistry, treatment and course have been analysed. The principal treatment policy for primary ENL has been radiotherapy. Of the 12 patients who received this treatment ten achieved a complete response (83 per cent). Eight remain free of disease at the time of writing. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is also considered.\r"

The authors conclude that the modified working classification of laryngeal cysts is easy to apply, of clinical relevance, and allows classification of cysts where operative trauma to the specimen obscures the relationship of the cyst to the surface epithelium. The origin and significance of tonsillar cysts are discussed and a relationship to the lympho-epithelial cyst of the oral cavity is suggested.\r"

A chart audit of reported indications for cesarean birth in a family practice residency population was done, and patients were classified using the O'Driscoll et al diagnostic criteria for dystocia. When reclassified, the percentage of cesarean births in this population for true cephalopelvic disproportion did not differ significantly from that reported from Dublin (6.1 as compared with 8.8), while the percentage done for inefficient uterine action was significantly greater (35.4 as compared with 4.2). This finding suggests there is a set of labors amenable to a management strategy that could result in a decrease in the cesarean birth rates if efficient uterine action is assured with adequate use of oxytocin.\r"

Four weeks of supplementation lowered the level to 6.73 mmol/L (260 mg/dL). When supplementation was discontinued, the cholesterol level rose slightly.

Of 293 adult patients approached in reception rooms, 262 between the ages of 17 and 70 years agreed to complete a brief screening instrument containing the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Twenty-seven percent of these patients scored in the depressed range. The twofold excess of depressed women occurred at the point of seeking consultation rather than within the reception room sample. None of the depressed patients gave depression as their reason for visit. A weighted sample of 57 depressed and 39 nondepressed patients was selected for a telephone interview incorporating previously validated measures of physical health, life stress, and social support. Self-reported depression scores were associated with physical symptoms, chronic health problems, recent life events, and a lack of supportive relationships. Additionally, the association between physical symptoms and depression was not due to simple overlap between measures, and less severe interpersonal disturbance was a better predictor of depression than were traumatic life events. Additive combinations of stress, health, and support variables accounted for up to 30 percent of the variance in depression. Overall, the results highlight the difficulties facing family physicians attempting to detect depression among their patients.\r"

Most residents perceived the welfare system as lacking; 83 percent agreed the poor are caught in a \"cycle of poverty,\" 82 percent agreed welfare benefits cause the poor to be dependent upon the system, and 48 percent believed indigent women become pregnant and have babies so they can collect welfare support. Conversely, only one in four residents believed that most poor people become poor as a result of lack of effort on their part, and one in five believed that society is coddling the poor. The majority of residents believed that poor patients are more likely than others to miss appointments without canceling (73 percent), more likely to be late for appointments (51 percent), and less knowledgeable about their illnesses (80 percent). One in four residents believed that poor patients tend not to appreciate the work of physicians and nurses, and 43 percent claimed that the poor are more difficult patients. The majority of residents believed that the poor are unlikely to practice preventive health behaviors (72 percent) or to be compliant with their medical regimen (60 percent).

Alcoholics' ASB competency scores under a \"give your typical response\" instructional set were significantly lower than controls' scores. In response to a \"give the very best response\" set, ASB scores for alcoholics and controls did not differ. Alcoholics' interpersonal problem-solving deficits appear to be due to their less effective execution of cognitive or problem-solving skills as opposed to their capacities for such skills. A lack of correlation between performance on impersonal neuropsychological tests and performance on the ASB suggests that these areas of functioning involve quite different psychological processes. In Study 2, alcoholics with alcoholic family members (family history positive) were found to have lower ASB scores than family history negative alcoholics. \"Best\" ASB responses were positively correlated with therapists' ratings of treatment behaviors and treatment outcome; \"typical\" ASB responses were not. Thus, alcoholics' therapeutic progress was predicted by their conceptualization of the \"best\" response in the interpersonal problem-solving situations and not by their typical pretreatment response.\r"

  ".W": "The authors studied a group of 149 hospitalized cocaine abusers as a follow-up to previous research performed in 1980-82, which had revealed a high prevalence of affective disorder in cocaine abusers. The authors hypothesized that the changing epidemiology of cocaine abuse since that time may have been accompanied by changes in the characteristics of patients seeking treatment for dependence on the drug. The cocaine abusers were compared with 293 other drug abusers to see whether clinical changes over time were specific to individuals abusing cocaine. The authors found slightly more affective disorder in the cocaine abusers when compared with the other patients (26.8% vs. 20.1%), with a significantly higher rate of cyclothymic disorder (11.4% vs. 2.7%, p less than .001). Affective illness was significantly more prevalent in the first-degree relatives of the cocaine abusers when compared with the sex-matched relatives of the other patients (p less than .05). Diagnostic trends changed a great deal, however, between the original 1980-82 study sample and the follow-up 1982-86 sample. The rate of affective disorder decreased over time from 50.0% to 21.0% (p less than .01), and the rate of affective illness in the families also declined, from 31.0% to 11.5% in females (p less than .001) and from 14.3% to 2.2% in males (p less than .001). No such change occurred in the comparison group of opioid and central nervous system depressant abusers. The authors conclude that although a substantial number of cocaine abusers suffer from concurrent affective disorder, this form of premorbid psychopathology has become a less important risk factor for the development of chronic cocaine abuse as cocaine use has become more widespread.\r"

A total of 45 psychotic patients were compared with 56 nonpsychotic psychiatric patients on the Harris and Lingoes subscales of the Sc scale. All subjects had T-score elevations on scale Sc greater than or equal to 70. The two criterion groups did not differ on overall scale Sc scores, but a distinctive pattern of subscale scores emerged that discriminated the samples. Psychotic patients obtained significantly higher scores on subscales measuring bizarre thinking and perceived loss of control over impulses and emotions. Conversely, nonpsychotics endorsed significantly more items on subscales concerned with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and thinking difficulties. These data suggest that homogeneous item-content dimensions of the Sc scale provide a means for distinguishing between psychotic and nonpsychotic patients who otherwise appear similar on overall scale Sc.\r"

A 1983 report in this journal by Galbraith et al. (J Nerv Ment Dis 171:670-675) demonstrated that the magnitude of crossover at this PI was influenced by the duration of the preparatory interval immediately prior (PPI) to the first trial of the 7-second isotemporal blocks. Secondary analyses reported here extend the examination of PPI influences and indicate: a) that the crossover phenomenon as assessed in the embedded sets procedure is due mainly to the very slow reaction time to the first trial of the 1-second isotemporal blocks; and b) that crossover in this paradigm is partially due to uncontrolled PPI influences across the 1-, 3-, and 7-second embedded blocks. These are further reasons for returning to the original Rodnick-Shakow method as Galbraith et al. recommended.\r"

With a follow-up from 6 to 72 months (median, 37 months), the actuarial freedom-from-progressive disease (FFP) at 5 years is 70% after STLI/TLI and 95% after IF plus VBM. One death has occurred in the irradiation-only treatment group. The data for IF plus VBM are significantly superior to previous actuarial results at 5 years using IF alone (FFP = 35%, P less than .00001) and compare favorably with prior results with IF plus nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, +/- prednisone (MOP[P]) chemotherapy (FFP = 80% at 5 years, P = .10). VBM is well tolerated with greater than 90% of calculated doses delivered. As anticipated, VBM has had relatively little adverse effect on male or female fertility. Selected pulmonary functions are reduced early after IF plus VBM to a greater degree than with irradiation of the mediastinum alone, but the differences are modest. Based upon our current numbers and follow-up, we can be 90% confident that VBM as an adjuvant to irradiation in favorable Hodgkin's disease is as effective, or even superior, to MOP(P) chemotherapy. Because of its lesser toxicity, adjuvant VBM may have a broader role in the management of Hodgkin's disease.\r"

  ".W": "When patients with aggressive lymphoma present with intraabdominal disease, a stable residual mass is frequently detected radiographically at the time of the clinical complete remission. To discern the optimal management for this clinical problem, we reviewed 241 patients with aggressive lymphoma treated at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) from 1977 to 1986. Seventy-two/241 patients (30%) had an abdominal mass at diagnosis and 29/72 (40%) were left with a radiographically detectable residual mass at clinical complete remission. The likelihood of a residual mass was much higher for patients with bulky disease (P2 less than .0003) (two-tailed test [P2]). Twenty-nine patients had radiologically stable residual masses after therapy, and of 22 (76%) with pathologic evaluations, 21 had negative specimens (95%) and one was positive (5%). None of the patients with negative pathologic evaluation has relapsed in the abdominal site (median follow-up, 31 months). Seven patients were observed clinically without laparotomy: five are alive, without evidence of disease, at 2 to 9 years; two relapsed with disseminated disease within 2 months of chemotherapy. Initial tumor size and size of the residual mass did not correlate with residual disease, since residual masses identified by radiographic examination did not usually harbor viable lymphoma cells. Aspiration cytology was negative for residual tumor in 15/16 cases. One negative result was not confirmed at laparotomy, presumably due to sampling error. The one positive aspiration was followed by a negative laparotomy, possibly due to subsequent tumor necrosis. Restaging laparotomy has a low yield. In most patients with aggressive lymphoma who have otherwise completely responded to carefully administered full-dose combination chemotherapy, stable residual abdominal masses can be closely followed clinically without surgical exploration.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is a malignancy that occurs frequently in the elderly with a median age greater than 60 years. However, most chemotherapy trials have included predominantly patients less than 60 years of age. We treated 157 patients with diffuse aggressive NHL between September 1982 and May 1986 with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), procarbazine, bleomycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CAP/BOP). There were no treatment exclusions for age. Patients in this study ranged in age from 15 to 91 years (median, 63) with 112 patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 65% with no significant difference for age less than 60 (76%) v age greater than or equal to 60 (61%) (P = .18). With a median 36-month follow-up (range, 22 to 65 months), the overall 5-year survival was 42%. The patients less than 60 years old had a 62% 5-year survival in contrast to a 34% 5-year survival in those patients greater than or equal to age 60 (P = .01). The deaths attributed to tumor or treatment-related toxicity were similar above and below age 60. The difference in survival was due to other causes of death not obviously related to the lymphoma or its therapy-occurring in 22% of patients greater than or equal to 60 years of age but only 2% of patients less than 60 years (P = .005). Our data supports the position that aggressive NHL in elderly patients is not significantly less responsive than in younger patients; however, the inclusion of older patients in clinical trials will decrease the overall survival secondary to deaths due to apparently unrelated causes.\r"

Overall diseases-free survival (DFS) for patients with 36 months minimum follow-up was 82% at 3 years. This figure did not decline further with time. Infradiaphragmatic bulk disease was found to be a significant prognostic factor for local and distant relapse as well as for ultimate survival. Patients with either stage 2A or 2B disease (infradiaphragmatic bulk less than or equal to 10 cm size) had a 3-year DFS of 89% compared with a 64% 3-year DFS rate for patients with stage 2C disease (infradiaphragmatic bulk greater than or equal to 10 cm size). The (local plus distant) relapse rate was 4.0% for patients with stage 2A disease, 16.7% for patients with stage 2B disease, and 33.3% for patients with stage 2C disease. The majority of distant relapses were multifocal and prophylactic mediastinal irradiation did not appear to influence either relapse rate nor overall survival. Of seven patients who relapsed, four died of progressive malignancy, two deaths were related to salvage chemotherapy, and only one patient is alive and well following successful chemotherapeutic salvage. On the basis of our experience, we recommend radiotherapy with the use of modern imaging techniques as initial treatment for patients with retroperitoneal masses less than 10 cm size. Aggressive cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be seriously considered for patients with retroperitoneal masses greater than or equal to 10 cm size, or for patients who relapse following radiotherapy.\r"

The overall mortality was 23.5%. None of the 19 patients with localized disease died of CNC, while 11% of the 24 patients with regional disease and all seven patients with extraregional disease at presentation died of CNC. A second primary malignancy was found to be associated with the CNC in 15% of the cases. The clinical course in patients with localized disease was favorable in spite of the high number of local recurrences. Also, the presence of regional metastases was not related to an unfavorable prognosis. In 68% of the cases the disease involved the lower limbs or girdle. In ten cases the overt exophytic presentation of primary CNC was replaced by the presence of tumor masses infiltrating the inguinal soft tissues with or without nodal involvement.\r"

A new neuroblastoma staging system is proposed that takes into account the most important elements of current but incompatible systems. Finally, criteria for response to treatment are standardized. The criteria proposed herein represent an international consensus of essentially every major pediatric oncology group or organization in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The staging system should be referred to as the International Neuroblastoma Staging System, and the response criteria as the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria. Implementation of these criteria will greatly facilitate the comparison of clinical and laboratory studies by different groups and countries. Furthermore, these criteria should serve as a foundation on which future modifications or improvements can be based.\r"

An initial feasibility study was performed in Rhesus monkeys comparing the subcutaneous route to intravenous (IV) injection and oral administration. The subcutaneous dose was completely absorbed and a sustained-release effect was observed when compared with the IV dose. No local or systemic toxicities resulted from subcutaneous methotrexate in the animals. Twelve children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance therapy protocols prescribing either 7.5 mg/m2 biweekly or 40 mg/m2 weekly were also monitored after both a subcutaneous and an oral dose of methotrexate. Four children at the higher dosage level were also studied after an equal IV dose. The subcutaneous dose was again completely absorbed in these children at both dose levels, whereas the oral dose, which produced comparable plasma drug concentrations at the lower dosage level, resulted in a total drug exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve) that was one third that of the equal subcutaneous dose at the higher dosage level. No local or systemic toxicity was attributed to the subcutaneous methotrexate. Subcutaneous administration of methotrexate is well tolerated and well absorbed and appears to overcome the problems associated with oral administration, including variable absorption and saturation of the absorption mechanism with increasing doses.\r"

Since PLA2 was found to induce inflammatory changes in the skin and joints of experimental animals, we tested whether the serum level of PLA2 correlates with the clinical activity of RA. In the group of 51 patients with classical or definite RA, 13 (25%) had high serum levels of PLA2 (over 2 standard deviations above the normal mean). Comparison of clinical disease activity in patients with high levels of PLA2 with those with normal PLA2 levels showed that patients with high PLA2 levels had a significantly higher joint count, more swollen joints, much higher Landsbury index, lower functional class, lower hemoglobin, lymphopenia and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). To more accurately assess the relationship between the PLA2 level and disease activity in RA, we formulated 2 indices. Clinical index consisted of the Landsbury index, number of swollen joints and duration of morning stiffness. Laboratory index consisted of hemoglobin, absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes, platelet count and ESR. Our results showed that both indices correlated strongly with PLA2 activity (p less than 0.0001). The results support the hypothesis that PLA2 plays a pathogenetic role in RA and suggest that serum PLA2 levels may serve as an additional measure of disease activity.\r"

Fourteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis, age range 44-77 years, participated in paired kinetic studies performed 1-4 weeks apart. The Abbott TDx fluorescence polarization immunoassay was used to measure serum levels and urinary excretion of MTX over 72 h after a single dose. The mean systemic bioavailability was 73% for the 15 mg oral dose. Area under the serum concentration versus time curve for a 50 mg oral dose was 1.1-2.7 times that of the 15 mg oral dose indicating dose dependent absorption. Mean kinetic variables after oral MTX did not differ significantly with and without NSAID therapy despite apparent interactions in individual patients. Renal clearance of MTX correlated with creatinine clearance (r = 0.8, p less than 0.01).\r"

Although the expense of MRI currently precludes its routine use in clinical practice, the apparent sensitivity of this diagnostic modality for detecting early changes in RA might make it an invaluable tool for therapeutic decision making or for assessing response in interventional trials.\r"

MRI demonstrated abnormal soft tissue masses thought to represent pannus in 9 patients. Three patients showed cord or brainstem compression due to pannus or atlantoaxial subluxation. The 3 patients with MRI evidence of cord or brainstem compression had neurologic signs or symptoms of cervical myelopathy, and appropriate therapy was instituted based on these findings. This study indicates that MRI is able to detect abnormal soft tissue masses which probably represent pannus and their relationship to the spinal cord or brainstem, and confirms the utility of the procedure in the management of craniovertebral involvement in RA.\r"

The relationship between coping strategies and psychological status, functional status, pain, and disease activity was analyzed. Coping was measured by an adapted version of the Ways of Coping Scale, and measures of psychological status, life stress, functional status, pain, and disease activity were also obtained. Canonical correlation revealed a significant relationship between the coping process and psychological status. Coping also was significantly related to functional status, but not to pain or disease activity. Patients who coped by restructuring life goals were found to have better psychological adjustment and functional status than patients who hoped for unrealistic solutions or engaged in self-blame.\r"

However, males had significantly greater spinal radiological change that was positively associated with hip arthritis.

The contributions of two indices, overconfidence and underconfidence, in the prediction of subsequent academic performance of examinees were studied. A total of 444 sophomore students (entering classes of 1982 and 1983) in one medical school were asked to indicate their confidence, on a 5-point scale (100, 75, 50, 25, and 0), in the correctness of their responses to each multiple-choice item on an Introduction to Clinical Medicine examination. Examinations were scored in two ways: in the conventional way, using the total number of correct responses, and by a confidence-weighted technique based on the level of certainty indicated for each response by the examinee. Only the conventional score determined the grade; the confidence-weighted score was calculated for the purely experimental purposes of this study. Overconfidence and underconfidence indices were also calculated by using the indicated levels of certainty. Improvements in the psychometrics of the examinations were observed when confidence-weighted scoring was used. In multiple-regression models, the confidence-weighted scores and indices of over- and underconfidence contributed significantly to predicting scores of the students studied on Parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners examinations, whereas the conventional score did not contribute to the prediction of Part II scores. Significant differences on junior clerkship examinations and ratings were observed between those who were highly overconfident and those who were slightly overconfident. The highly overconfident students also estimated higher future incomes than did those who were slightly overconfident.\r"

In the present study, the authors examined the characteristics and beliefs of those faculty members who volunteered as tutors for problem-based teaching during the first two years of the New Pathway Project at Harvard Medical School. The results confirm several major conclusions of innovation research: that an individual's adoption of an innovation is heavily influenced by his or her perceived need for change and the benefits that might result from becoming involved in this change; that initial adopters tend to be oriented toward institutional colleagueship; and that personal contacts with colleagues play an essential role in their decision to participate. In addition, the desire to improve medical education emerged as a major motive for involvement in the problem-based curriculum.\r"

For this purpose a questionnaire was constructed and administered to 55 internal medicine residents at the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University. Responses indicate that the residents enjoyed teaching and considered it a critical component of their own experience and education. These residents' views appear unrelated to their previous teaching or academic backgrounds or to plans for an academic career. A number of variables correlated with teaching satisfaction. The teaching experience can be improved, the survey suggests, by lessening distractions and interruptions that occur during teaching sessions, freeing residents of some other obligations so that more time may be devoted to teaching, increasing faculty members' observation and guidance of teaching, and carefully structuring the content of the residents' teaching sessions.\r"

Although their attitudes toward supportive programs were generally favorable, a minority of the house officers felt that residents expressing the need for support were less competent than other residents or needed to change to a less rigorous specialty. A majority felt that it was unfair to require senior house officers to provide coverage for interns attending a support group. They felt that support should be made available to all house officers rather than interns only and that stress would be reduced by eliminating the sources of stress as well as by providing supportive programs. Training program directors need to be aware of and anticipate these attitudes before designing supportive programs.\r"
