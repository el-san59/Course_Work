  ".W": "The concept that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) supplementation protects against coronary heart disease developed in the late 1970s when vitamin C intakes in industrialized nations were lower than at present. Supplementation was then shown to lower plasma total cholesterol and, among some elderly men, to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, among people in initially good vitamin C nutriture, these effects are usually not seen. In five populations of essentially healthy people, blood pressure has been found to correlate negatively with vitamin C status. Recently, in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, extra ascorbic acid for 6 wk was observed to lower systolic and pulse pressure in a small group of borderline hypertensive subjects.\r"

  ".W": "Essential antioxidants were determined in plasma of middle-aged men representing 16 European study populations, which differed sixfold in age-specific mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD). In 12 populations with \"common\" plasma cholesterol (5.7-6.2 mmol/L) and blood pressure, both classical risk factors lacked significant correlations to IHD mortality, whereas absolute levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) showed a strong inverse correlation (r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002). Evaluating all populations, cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were moderately associated, but their correlation was inferior to that of vitamin E. In stepwise regression and multiple regression analysis, mortality was predictable to 62% by lipid-standardized vitamin E, to 79% by vitamin E and cholesterol, to 83% after inclusion of lipid-standardized vitamin A (retinol), and to 87% by all the above parameters plus blood pressure. Thus, in the present study the cross-cultural differences of IDH mortality are primarily attributable to plasma status of vitamin E, which might have protective functions.\r"

The geographic distribution of cataract is known to be associated with the intensity and duration of sunlight--especially of the ultraviolet frequency--at particular places. Exposure of animals and humans to oxygen has also been known to result in cataract formation. Studies described in this communication indicate that the ocular lens is physiologically damaged when exposed to an environment of active species of oxygen, commonly referred to as oxyradicals. Several photochemical and nonphotochemical models have been described. The results suggest that an intraocular generation of active oxygen may constitute a significant risk factor in the overall pathogenesis of senile cataracts. The cataractogenic effect of oxyradicals, however, can be thwarted by nutritional and metabolic antioxidants such as ascorbate, vitamin E, and pyruvate. These agents, therefore, may be useful for prophylaxis or therapy against cataracts.\r"

If so, appropriate amounts of the antioxidant vitamins C and E might be expected to prevent or retard the process. Such activity has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo studies of experimentally-induced cataracts. A recent epidemiologic study found that cataract patients tended to have lower serum levels of vitamins C, E, or carotenoids than did control subjects. The present investigation, which compared the self-reported consumption of supplementary vitamins by 175 cataract patients with that of 175 individually matched, cataract-free subjects, revealed that the latter group used significantly more supplementary vitamins C and E (P = 0.01 and 0.004, respectively). Because the results suggested a reduction in the risk of cataracts of at least 50%, a randomized, controlled trial of vitamin supplementation in cataract prevention may be warranted.\r"

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended consumption of five or more servings of vegetables and fruits daily, as did the 1989 Diet and Health report, which also emphasized fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C and carotenoids. In contrast with these recommendations and strong evidence for a beneficial effect, very few individuals in the United States even approach the recommended levels of intake. In the US NHANES II data, 41% of the population had no fruit on the survey day; only one fourth had a fruit or vegetable rich in vitamin A or in vitamin C. Only 10% consumed the recommended five servings. Efforts to increase consumption of these foods are needed to improve the diet and health of the population.\r"

It has been utilized to investigate both the involvement of phagocyte-derived reactive oxidants in the pathogenesis of pulmonary dysfunction and carcinogenesis, as well as the possible role of nutritional antioxidants in the prevention of oxidant-mediated tissue damage. Reactive oxidants generated by activated phagocytes appear to be primary mediators of spirometric abnormalities in cigarette smokers. Cigarette smoking is also associated with decreased plasma levels of ascorbate and beta-carotene, which indicates that the smoking-related chronic inflammatory response leads to an imbalance of oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis and possible predisposition to oxidant-inflicted tissue damage and disease.\r"

Supplemented babies had a lower incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) diagnosed by ultrasound (9/102, 8.8%) than the control group (37/108, 34.3%; 95% CI for difference in incidence, 15-36%). In a subsequent uncontrolled study using the same vitamin E preparation, a single dose of 20 mg/kg was given soon after birth to preterm babies. The peak mean +/- SD plasma level was 32.97 +/- 13.47 mumol/L at 48 h. The incidence of IVH (16/121, 13.2%) was lower than in historical control from the randomized trial (95% CI for difference; 10.2-31.8%) in spite of the single-dose group having more clinical risk factors for IVH. We conclude that vitamin E protects against IVH in preterm babies.\r"

In spite of the vast complexity of aging processes, relatively less complex processes such as longevity determinant genes (LDGs) may exist governing aging rate. Much experimental data exists indicating a causative role of oxyradicals in aging processes. In testing the hypothesis that antioxidants may represent LDGs, a positive correlation in the tissue concentration of specific antioxidants with life span of mammals was found. These antioxidants include superoxide dismutase, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, and uric acid. We also found that the resistance of tissues to spontaneous autoxidation and the amount of oxidative damage to DNA correlates inversely with life span of mammals. These results suggest a role of oxyradicals in causing aging and that the antioxidant status of an individual could be important in determining frequency of age-dependent diseases and duration of general health maintenance.\r"

The primary endpoint of the trial was the need to treat patients with levodopa. The time when levodopa became necessary in the treated patients was compared with another group of patients followed elsewhere and not taking antioxidants. The time when levodopa became necessary was extended by 2.5 y in the group taking antioxidants. The results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by the administration of these antioxidants. A large multicenter, controlled clinical trial currently underway in North America evaluating tocopherol and deprenyl has the potential to confirm these results.\r"

Among the different micronutrients, antioxidative vitamins and beta-carotene are particularly effective in modulating immune functions and host defense against microorganisms or other invasive processes. This involves antigen-specific humoral or cell-mediated reactions of the immune system as well as nonspecific inflammatory processes. Owing to the interactions between micronutrient status and immunocompetence, the assessment of the micronutrient status of an individual can help to predict the risk of specific diseases associated with a deficient or suppressed immunocompetence, eg, infection or cancer. By the appropriate intervention it should be possible to modify this risk as has been shown in a number of carefully controlled studies. Assessment of the immunocompetence of an individual by measuring a limited number of key parameters of the immune system can help in the very early detection of specific micronutrient deficiencies.\r"

Some recent findings suggest roles for beta-carotene and/or vitamin C in reversing or reducing the risk of cervical dysplasia and oral leukoplakia. There are some indications that vitamin C and beta-carotene may reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. Additional epidemiological and molecular biology studies and clinical intervention trials using premalignant lesions as the marker of specific cancer risks should become an important component of future research in the area of cancer chemoprevention.\r"

The results of individual trials do not provide conclusive evidence that administration of a single dose of surfactant improves morbidity or mortality. Meta-analysis is a statistical method to combine the results of such clinical trials, and combined analysis provides a means to overcome the problem of not being able to detect significant small differences in individual trials due to these small sample sizes. Seven clinical trials (277 patients treated with nonhuman surfactant extract and 263 controls) met the criteria for analysis; five outcome measurements (mortality, patent ductus arteriosus, pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia) were selected to estimate the treatment effect. The meta-analysis showed that a single dose of surfactant administered before the first breath or within 15 hours of birth significantly decreased the mortality rate (95% confidence interval = -0.19 to -0.03) and the risk of developing pneumothorax (95% confidence interval = -0.28 to 0.14) in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate other aspects of surfactant replacement therapy in premature infants because inconsistent results were observed among the seven analyzed studies.\r"

Dietary control of blood phenylalanine below 900 mumol/L was maintained beyond age 10 years in 23 children; 72 others had blood phenylalanine persistently above that level at ages ranging from 18 months to 10 years. Test scores at age 12 years were negatively correlated with the age at initiation of diet and with blood phenylalanine levels from ages 4 to 10 years, and positively correlated with parent IQ scores and the age at loss of dietary control. Children who maintained phenylalanine levels below 900 mumol/L beyond age 10 years showed no deficits in test scores, except for arithmetic, the scores of which declined between ages 6 and 12 years in 90% of the children in this study. These data strongly support a recommendation that dietary restriction of phenylalanine should be maintained through adolescence.\r"

An additional three patients underwent repair at 5 1/2, 8, and 9 1/2 months of age. Six (18.2%) of 33 patients died. All the survivors were not receiving cardiac medications or diuretics at the time of the last follow-up visit. Examination of 24 of 27 survivors at 1 to 5 years of age revealed normal growth in 75% of the patients. Two patients had height, weight, and head circumference below the fifth percentile for age. Four patients had height and weight appropriate for age but head circumference below the fifth percentile. Neurodevelopmental testing yielded normal findings in 18 patients. Three patients were considered suspect and an additional three were abnormal neurodevelopmentally. Head circumference less than the fifth percentile, abnormalities on computed tomographic scans of the brain, and emergency balloon atrial septostomy or emergency switch operation were more likely to occur in patients who had low neurodevelopmental scores. We conclude that the majority of patients who undergo arterial switch repair demonstrate normal growth and development and no impairment of cardiovascular function. However, significant morbidity in the form of neurodevelopmental problems may occur.\r"

We postulated that ISAM have increased sympathetic nervous system tone and altered catecholamine levels. Therefore, we measured plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine levels and the number and receptor affinity of beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites on lymphocytes and alpha-adrenoreceptor binding sites on thrombocytes in 22 otherwise healthy ISAM (age, 2.1 +/- 0.5 months; mean +/- SD) and 15 healthy controls (age, 2.5 +/- 0.8 months). Norepinephrine levels in venous blood were 1.8-fold higher in ISAM than in control infants (6.30 +/- 3.85 nmol/L vs 3.55 +/- 2.45 nmol/L). There were no differences in plasma epinephrine or dopamine levels. There were no differences in the number of binding sites or receptor affinity for beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptors. We conclude that ISAM have elevated circulating norepinephrine levels compared with controls. We speculate that this is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system tone in ISAM and that the absence of adrenoreceptor down-regulation may create catecholamine suprasensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Optimal strategies for identifying children with hypercholesterolemia have not been established. Several groups have advocated that testing of serum cholesterol levels be limited to those children who have family histories of hyperlipidemia or premature coronary heart disease. We studied the ability of comprehensive family histories to identify children with hyperlipidemia in a group of 114 children (mean age, 8 +/- 4 years) who were referred for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. A positive family history was defined according to guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The mean fasting total cholesterol in the children was 5.74 +/- 1.42 mmol/L (222 mg/dL). Family history was negative for hypercholesterolemia or premature coronary heart disease in 22 (22%) of 100 children with total cholesterol levels greater than the 75th percentile for their ages, in 13 (18.3%) of 71 children with total cholesterol levels greater than the 95th percentile for their ages, and in four (11.8%) of 34 children with presumed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Of the 78 children who had both hypercholesterolemia and positive family histories, hyperlipidemia was reported in 72 families, whereas premature heart disease was reported in only 27. We conclude that in a population of children referred because of known hypercholesterolemia, a detailed family history not only fails to identify many children with mild hypercholesterolemia, but also fails to identify a significant proportion of children with markedly elevated cholesterol levels. Additionally, in families of children with hypercholesterolemia, a history of hyperlipidemia is more common than a history of premature heart disease.\r"

Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in 34 (25%), 16 (12%), and eight (6%) children, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus occurred in all age groups, H influenzae type b occurred only in children younger than 3 years and was the number one cause of disease in this group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred exclusively in children older than 9 years. Children with H influenzae type b had clinical and laboratory findings that were almost indistinguishable from a matched group of children with osteomyelitis due to other known bacteria, although children with H influenzae type b tended to have more joint effusions (63% vs 27%), less lower extremity disease (22% vs 70%), and fewer positive cultures from bone or joint aspirates (41% vs 89%). Unlike most pediatric cases of osteomyelitis, the ones due to P aeruginosa did not represent the hematogenous route of infection; penetrating injury to the foot was present in every case. Children with P aeruginosa infections were older than 9 years (100%), predominantly male (88%), often afebrile (83%), and never bacteremic. These data provide guidelines for the initial work-up and management of osteomyelitis in children.\r"

Most of the pneumococcal isolates were serotyped; serotype 19, in particular, seemed to be unusually common in these children. Twenty-three of the 29 children with pneumococcal osteomyelitis and/or arthritis had been hospitalized in the past 15 years. These 23 children were compared with 161 hospitalized children who had bone and joint infections with other isolated bacteria. The children with pneumococcal osteomyelitis and/or arthritis were indistinguishable from most of the other children, except by age. All but three of the children with pneumococcal osteomyelitis and/or arthritis were between the ages of 3 and 24 months. In this age group, Pneumococcus was the common isolate from children with osteomyelitis, and second only to Haemophilus influenzae from children with bacterial arthritis. Pneumococcal osteomyelitis and/or arthritis has never been rare; the medical literature describes at least 245 other children, most of whom were younger than 2 years.\r"

The physician's ability to interact with school personnel and communities is one important approach to this outreach effort. School health training has been a required 6-month component of the pediatric residency curriculum at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, since 1979, with second-year residents providing weekly on-site consultations to public school districts and participating in a weekly school health seminar series. In this study, graduates from this program were surveyed to determine their evaluations of the training and extent of current school involvement and to use their evaluations for curriculum evaluation. Residents who participated in the school consultation from 1979 through 1988 were surveyed. Seventy-eight pediatricians responded, a 79% return rate. Ratings by the graduates reveal that both pediatric generalists and subspecialists highly value their training experiences. Ratings were not related to the specific site to which the resident consultant had been assigned. Of these pediatricians, 41% are currently consulting with school personnel. These findings are discussed as they relate to other reports of physician involvement in schools and provide clues to curriculum design for school health training in pediatric residency.\r"

In this infant, malformations of the vertebral laminae, most prominent in the basiocciput and atlas vertebra, led to compression of the rostral cervical spinal cord, causing gliosis and focal necrosis. Stenosis of the foramen magnum and spinal canal may contribute to the ventilatory insufficiency that often causes death in patients with thanatophoric dysplasia. We suggest that the causes of death in patients with thanatophoric dysplasia and other severe forms of osteochondrodysplasia should be sought in neuraxial injury rather than attributed solely to pulmonary hypoplasia.\r"

Echocardiography showed aortic root enlargement in 12 (80%) of 15 patients and mitral valve prolapse in 12 (80%) of 15. None had a normal echocardiogram. At follow-up examination, one patient had developed aortic root enlargement, and one patient, mitral valve prolapse. Thus, although aortic root enlargement is usually present in early childhood in patients with Marfan syndrome, it is not considered specific because in this study it also occurred in one child with Alport's syndrome and in one with marfanoid features. Four patients with aortic root enlargement were treated with propranolol and their echocardiograms showed no further increase in the aortic root diameter for several years. We recommend echocardiography in the diagnosis and routine management of children in whom Marfan syndrome is suspected.\r"

A three-base-pair deletion in exon 10 resulting in a loss of the phenylalanine residue at amino acid position 508 of the gene product, termed the CF conductance regulator protein, accounts for 70% of cases of CF in white subjects. However, this gene defect occurs in only 37% of affected blacks. Analysis of CF genes from American blacks has revealed a number of mutations, most of which are unique to that population. We therefore searched for potential differences in expression of CF between 24 black and 48 white patients with CF matched for birth date and gender. Black patients more frequently presented with only respiratory symptoms (38% vs 10%). Black patients had fewer hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbations (2 vs 6.9), a better mean forced vital capacity (77% vs 62% of predicted), and higher chest roentgenogram scores (18.2 vs 14.4) than white patients. Complication rates were similar except for a higher incidence of hyponatremic dehydration (21% vs 2%) and peptic ulcer disease (13% vs 0%) in blacks. Survival time appeared to be longer in blacks, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that phenotypic differences exist between black and white patients with CF, which may be due to the genetic heterogeneity between these two populations.\r"

  ".W": "We have used the proximity of probe hybridization sites in interphase chromatin to derive the order of DNA sequences in a 2-3-Mbp region of human chromosome Xq28. The map generated bridges the results of genetic and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping to produce a more complete map of Xq28 than possible with either of these other techniques alone. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to detect the positions of two or more probes in G1 male interphase nuclei. We show that cosmids that are 50 kbp to 2-3 Mbp apart can be ordered rapidly with two alternative approaches: (1) by comparing the average measured distance between two probes and (2) simply by scoring the order of red and green fluorescent dots after detection of three or more probes with two fluorochromes. The validity of these approaches is demonstrated using five cosmids from a region spanning approximately 800 kbp that includes the factor VIII (F8), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), and color-vision pigment (CV) genes. The cosmid map derived from interphase mapping is consistent with the map determined by restriction-fragment analysis. The two interphase mapping approaches were then used (1) to orient the F8/CV cluster relative to two markers, c1A1 and st14c, which we show by metaphase mapping to be proximal to the F8/CV cluster, (2) to position st14c (DXS52) between c1A1 and F8, and (3) to orient the CV gene cluster relative to G6PD by using two CV-flanking cosmids, 18b41 and fr7. The probe order in Xq28 derived from interphase proximity is cen-c1A1-st14c-5'F8 (p624-p542-p625)-G6PD-18b41-3' green-green-red-fr7-tel. We also show that, to determine their order by using metaphase chromosomes, sequences must be at least 1 Mbp apart, an order of magnitude greater than required in interphase chromatin. The data show that FISH mapping is a simple way to order sequences separated by greater than or equal to 50 kbp for the construction of long-range maps of mammalian genomes.\r"

In our previous study, we demonstrated in APRT*J a single common base change which accounts for 70% of the Japanese mutants. The present report describes the analysis of an APRT*Q0 mutation in Japanese subjects. Two nucleotide substitutions common to all seven affected alleles from four unrelated subjects (three homozygotes and a heterozygote) were identified: G----A at nucleotide position 1453 and C----T at 1456. The G----A altered the amino acid Trp98 to a stop codon. The C----T did not alter Ala99. These point mutations were demonstrated by sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA and cDNA. The G----A change at 1453 results in the elimination of a PflMI site in the APRT gene. PflMI digests, which were used to confirm the G----A transition, can be useful in screening for this specific mutation.\r"

Seven regions are defined by this panel, two of which lie between DXS369 and DXS296, until now the closest genetic markers that flank FRAXA. Of those two interesting regions, one is just distal to DXS369 and defined by probe 2-71 (DXS476), which is not polymorphic. The next one contains probes St677 (DXS463) and 2-34 (DXS477), which are within 130 kb and both detect TaqI RFLPs. The combined informativeness of these two probes is 30%. We cloned from an irradiation-reduced hybrid line another new polymorphic probe, Do33 (DXS465; 42% heterozygosity). This probe maps to the DXS296 region, proximal to a chromosomal breakpoint that corresponds to the Hunter syndrome locus (IDS). The physical order is thus Cen-DXS369-DXS476-(DXS463,DXS477)-(DXS296, DXS465)-IDS-DXS304-tel. We performed a linkage analysis for five of these markers in both the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain families and in a large set of fragile-X families. This establishes that DXS296 is distal to FRAXA. The relative position of DXS463 and DXS477 with respect to FRAXA remains uncertain, but our results place them genetically halfway between DXS369 and DXS304. Thus the DXS463-DXS477 cluster defines presently either the closest proximal or the closest distal polymorphic marker with respect to FRAXA. The three new polymorphic probes described here have a combined heterozygosity of 60% and represent a major improvement for genetic analysis of fragile-X families, in particular for diagnostic applications.\r"

The corresponding genotypes AA, Aa, and aa are then considered to have separate means and variances. This paper is concerned with estimating the parameters of the model, and their standard errors, by using an application of the EM algorithm. This technique also caters for the fact that the sensitivity measurements are only known to lie between the endpoints of certain intervals and that the exact measurement of the attribute is not possible.\r"

Analysis of a large kindred with dopa-responsive dystonia, using this new polymorphism and conventional RFLPs for the 9q32-34 region, excludes loci in this region as a cause of this form of dystonia.

The differences among the types appear to be due to base substitution at 19 cleavage sites, one deletion, and one conformational mutation. The numbers of differences imply that these modern Jews stem from a minimum of 21 maternal lineages that were already distinct from one another 4,000-5,000 years ago. In three of the four cases where a type was found in more than one person, it occurred in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic populations. The diversity of types in the combined sample of two Jewish populations is lower than both that in a sample from various parts of Africa and that in a sample from various parts of East Asia.

In a sample of 99 unrelated Caucasians, the D1S80 locus demonstrated a heterozygosity of 80.8% with 37 phenotypes and 16 alleles. The distribution of genotypes is in agreement with expected values according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Furthermore, the observed number of alleles and the level of heterozygosity, obtained through the protocol described here, were congruent with each other in accordance with the expectation of a mutation-drift equilibrium model for a single, homogeneous, random-mating population. Therefore, the analysis of D1S80 and similar VNTR loci by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AMP-FLP) may prove useful as models for population genetic issues for VNTR loci analyzed by RFLP typing via Southern blotting.\r"

Differences in beliefs were associated with differences in genetic etiology, indicating that beliefs were affected by the specific information provided in genetic counseling. Factor analysis identified a cluster of Q-sort items characterized by a highly personal relationship to the cause of the disorder (e.g., personal attributes, being selected and blessed, and God's actions). Subjects who rated these items low had a belief pattern, designated impersonal, that was consistent with a scientific worldview and that indicated psychological distancing from the cause of the child's disorder. Subjects who rated these items high, the personal belief pattern, had a mixture of scientific and nonscientific beliefs that indicated a sense of personal involvement in the cause of the child's disorder. Subjects with the two belief patterns were equally knowledgeable about the genetics of the disorder. Thus, the personal belief pattern did not appear to interfere with acceptance or understanding of the information provided in genetic counseling.\r"

This hypothesis is derived from two lines of evidence. First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate from different parental chromosomes. In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15. The second line of evidence comes from the deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. These patients have two maternal copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of one copy from each parent. By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 specific DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. Inheritance of one maternal copy and one paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS phenotype in these patients.\r"

Other ADRP pedigrees have shown linkage at zero recombination, linkage with recombination, and no linkage, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity. The gene encoding rhodopsin, the rod photoreceptor pigment, is closely linked to locus D3S47 on chromosome 3q. A point mutation changing a conserved proline to histidine in the 23d codon of the gene has been demonstrated in affected members of one ADRP family and in 17 of 148 unrelated ADRP patients. We have sequenced the rhodopsin gene in a C17-linked ADRP family and have identified in the 4th exon and in-frame 3-bp deletion which deletes one of the two isoleucine monomers at codons 255 and 256. This mutation was not found in 30 other unrelated ADRP families. The deletion has arisen in the sequence TCATCATCAT, deleting one of a run of three x 3-bp repeats. The mechanism by which this occurred may be similar to that which creates length variation in so-called mini- and microsatellites. Thus ADRP is an extremely heterogeneous disorder which can result from a range of defects in rhodopsin and which can have a locus or loci elsewhere in the genome.\r"

The syndrome was originally reported in 1964 in a family on the Aland Islands. To determine the localization of the AIED gene, linkage studies were performed in this family. total of 37 polymorphisms, covering loci on the entire X chromosome, were used. By two-point analysis the strongest evidence for linkage was obtained between AIED and DXS255 (maximum lod score [Zmax] 4.92 at maximum recombination fraction [theta max] .00). Marker loci DXS106, DXS159, and DXS1 also showed no recombination with AIED. Other positive lod scores at theta max .00 were obtained with markers localized in the XY homologous region in Xq13-q21, but the numbers of informative meioses were small. Multilocus linkage analysis indicated that the most probable location of AIED is in the pericentromeric region between DXS7 and DXS72. These results rule out localizations of AIED more distal on Xp that have been proposed by others. Our data do not exclude the possibility that AIED and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness are caused by mutations in the same gene. This question should be resolved by careful clinical comparison of the disorders and ultimately by the molecular dissection of the genes themselves.\r"

Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient.

An IP locus, designated IP1, probably resides in Xp11.21, since five unrelated patients with nonfamilial IP have been identified who possess constitutional de novo reciprocal X;autosome translocations involving Xp11.21. We have used a series of somatic cell hybrids containing the rearranged chromosomes derived from three of the five IP1 patients, along with other hybrid cell lines, to map probes in the vicinity of the IP1 locus. Five anonymous DNA loci--DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, and DXS370--have been mapped to a region within Xp11.21, between two IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints; the IP1 t(X;17) breakpoint is proximal (centromeric) to this region, and the IP1 t(X;13) and t(X;9) X-chromosomal breakpoints lie distal to it. While no IP1 translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) analysis, an overlap between three probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, and cpX210--has been detected, placing these probes within 125 kb. Four probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, cpX210, and 30CE2.8--have been helpful in constructing a 1,250-kb PFGE map of the region between the breakpoints; these results suggest that the IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints are separated by at least this distance. The combined somatic cell hybrid and PFGE analyses we report here favor the probe order DXS323-(IP1 t(X;13), IP1, t(X;9]-(DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, DXS370)-(IP1 t(X;17), DXZ1). These sequences provide a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the IP1 translocation breakpoints; the availability of IP1 translocation breakpoints should now assist the cloning of this locus.\r"

Short sequence repeats have recently been described as an abundant class of DNA polymorphisms in the human genome, which can be typed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. We describe the usage of such markers on chromosome 21 in the study of parental origin of the additional chromosome 21 in 87 cases of Down syndrome. The polymorphisms studied were (a) two (GT)n repeats and a poly(A) tract of an Alu sequence within the HMG14 gene and (b) a (GT)n repeat of locus D21S156. The parental origin was determined in 68 cases by studying the segregation of polymorphic alleles in the nuclear families (either by scoring three different alleles in the proband or by dosage comparison of two different alleles in the proband). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of highly informative PCR markers for the study of nondisjunction in Down syndrome.\r"

We have prepared specific polyvalent antibodies against bovine ferrochelatase in rabbits. The specificity of the antibody preparation against ferrochelatase was demonstrated by western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of ferrochelatase activity. The antibody also cross-reacted weakly with ferrochelatase from human mitochondria. To quantify immunoreactive ferrochelatase in tissue samples, a kinetic-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA) was developed. Ferrochelatase activity and the level of immunoreactive protein were measured in hepatic mitochondria isolated from six normal and nine protoporphyric (homozygous) cattle. Ferrochelatase activity was less than 10% of normal in mitochondria from protoporphyric animals; the amount of immunoreactive material was equivalent to that from normal animals. Similar studies were performed with samples from three normal and two protoporphyric (heterozygous) humans. Ferrochelatase activity was decreased in protoporphyric samples (about 17% of normal, but there was no concomitant decrease in immunoreactive material. These data demonstrate that a normal amount of ferrochelatase protein is present and suggest that bovine and human protoporphyria result from point mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase.\r"

Histologic and ultrastructural studies of the cartilage in pseudoachondroplasia and in homozygous achondroplasia have suggested a structural abnormality in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), a major structural protein in the extra-cellular matrix. The gene encoding CSPG core protein (CSPGCP) is thus a logical \"candidate gene\" for analysis in these conditions. cDNA probes encoding CSPGCP were used to identify restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in DNA from a panel of control individuals. No gross alterations at the CSPGCP locus were noted in DNA from 37 individuals with achondroplasia and 5 individuals with pseudoachondroplasia. In addition, allelic frequencies of the RFLPs were not significantly different among controls and patients with either condition. In one three-generation family with achondroplasia, close linkage of the CSPGCP locus and the skeletal dysplasia was excluded using a Bgl II polymorphism. Similarly, in a three-generation family with pseudoachondroplasia, the CSPGCP gene was not tightly linked to the disease phenotype. These results indicate that mutations at the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core protein locus do not cause achondroplasia or pseudoachondroplasia in these families.\r"

Nearly all the cases my colleagues and I have seen were in adult women, in whom the onset of inflammatory bruising could often be precisely dated, frequently some weeks after an injury or surgical procedure or, more often, severe emotional stress. Bouts of bruising were often preceded by sensations localized to the affected site. Cutaneous responses to the injection of erythrocytes were erratic. The patients described a wide range of both hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic complaints, including, among others, severe headaches, paresthesias, repeated syncope, diplopia (sometimes monocular), and \"nervousness.\" Psychiatric studies indicated that patients had overt depression, sexual problems, feelings of hostility, and obsessive-compulsive behavior. The patients had traits that can be described as typical of a hysterical character disorder. Therapy of autoerythrocyte sensitization--that is, psychogenic purpura--has been difficult; in younger individuals, psychiatric therapy has appeared to be beneficial.\r"

Polymorphisms within the beta-globin-like gene cluster influence disease severity by varying gamma-gene expression and the amount of Hb F within the cells. Few persons with the sickle cell trait experience adverse consequences attributable to the beta s gene. Is this also due to genetic factors? A literature search failed to answer this question. It is intriguing, however, that reported associations of sickle cell trait and splenic infarction have occurred exclusively in males and mostly in whites. Plausible but scanty data suggest that splenic infarction, hematuria, and reduced renal concentrating ability may be associated with higher amounts of Hb S. Therefore, alpha-thalassemia may be protective. No evidence was found that the amount of Hb S influenced the incidence of sudden death after exertion or that increased amounts of Hb F accounted for protection against any complications. More detailed reporting of biochemical and genetic evaluations of persons with sickle cell trait who experience related clinical events may lead to a better understanding of risks in subpopulations of persons carrying a single beta s gene.\r"

The common, dose-dependent, reversible bone marrow suppression from chloramphenicol is a consequence of mitochondrial injury. The greater erythroid susceptibility to chloramphenicol appears to be a function of the endogenous mitochondrial amino acid pools. The pathogenesis of aplastic anemia from chloramphenicol treatment remains uncertain. A large body of indirect evidence favors a complex mechanism involving metabolic transformation of the p-NO2 group of chloramphenicol by the predisposed subject, leading to the production of a toxic intermediate causing stem cell damage. A concept is presented wherein metabolites of chloramphenicol generated by intestinal bacteria undergo further metabolic transformation in the bone marrow with in situ production of toxic intermediate. This concept of the marrow being both the metabolic site for the offending agent as well as the target for its toxic metabolites will likely apply to other potential myelotoxins.\r"

Because of danazol's impairment of the pituitary-hypothalamic interactions with gonads, it is an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of endometriosis and cystic disease of the breast. It is effective in the treatment of hereditary angioneurotic edema, but the mechanism of this therapeutic success is unclear. Danazol has been used, without universal success, in the treatment of other gynecologic and certain hematologic disorders.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Platelet-poor plasma samples were obtained in EDTA, citrate, or citrate-hirudin-aprotinin-leupeptin from 36 patients with single-episode TTP, eight patients with intermittent TTP, four patients with chronic relapsing TTP, and 26 patients with HUS. The samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis, overlaid with rabbit 125I-anti-human vWF IgG, and analyzed by autoradiography. RESULTS: Abnormalities of vWF multimers were found in platelet-poor plasma samples from 31 of 36 found in platelet-poor plasma samples from 31 of 36 patients (86%) at the onset of and during their single TTP episode. vWF multimers larger than those in normal plasma, and similar to vWF forms observed within normal human endothelial cells (unusually large vWF multimers), were demonstrated in 31% of the patients; 19% had either unusually large vWF multimers or a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF forms in different serial samples; 36% had a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF forms. These results imply that endothelial cell injury or intense stimulation, along with the attachment of unusually large vWF multimers and the largest plasma vWF forms to platelets, occurred during the single TTP episodes in most patients. Patterns of vWF multimers were normal in 92% of patients with single-episode TTP studied after recovery. All eight patients with intermittent TTP and the four patients with chronic relapsing TTP had unusually large vWF multimers in their plasma between episodes, and these multimers decreased or disappeared during relapses. Of 26 children and adults with HUS, 14 had a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF multimeric forms and one had unusually large vWF multimers during the episode (vWF multimeric abnormalities in 58% of the patients). CONCLUSION: It is probable that vWF was involved in the pathophysiology of TTP in most of these patients with the single-episode, intermittent, or chronic relapsing types of TTP, and in more than 50% of the patients with HUS.\r"

  ".W": "In the last few years, remarkable advances have been made in the understanding of lipoprotein metabolism in the pathogenesis of renal disease in animal models and in vitro cell culture. Central to this work is the problem of the progression of renal disease in humans. This review recapitulates the theory (Lancet 1982; II: 1309-1312) that the progression of disease depends in part on the damage inflicted on the glomerulus by lipoproteins. The glomerular environment of high or low pressure, basement membrane damage, and destruction or damage of the mesangial and epithelial cells permits the filtration of protein, the consequence of which is hyperlipidemia. Whatever the therapeutic measures employed, if proteinuria persists, hyperlipidemia will follow. This suggest that lipoprotein toxicity may contribute to the final common path of renal damage in progressive renal disease. \"Lipoprotein toxicity\" in arteries is called atherosclerosis, but this term ignores the complexity of the glomerulus and the possible tubular damage that might be caused by filtered lipoprotein. It is clear there is insufficient knowledge of the metabolism of the damaged kidney to confidently attribute the pathology of progression of disease to any single process.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive deterioration in renal function frequently occurs in the absence of the original cause of injury. During the past decade, intense investigations into the factors responsible for progressive nephron destruction have demonstrated that hemodynamic stresses and metabolic and coagulation abnormalities participate in glomerular injury. Hyperlipidemia is a common abnormality in renal disease and is frequently aggravated by protein-uria. Experimentally, therapy with the lipid-lowering agents clofibric acid or lovastatin reduced circulating lipids, particularly cholesterol, decreased proteinuria, and prevented glomerular damage in normotensive and hypertensive models of progressive renal disease. These beneficial effects occurred independently of changes in systemic blood pressure or glomerular injury, supporting the notion that cholesterol or its accompanying changes, or both, were central in lipid modulation of glomerulosclerosis. Clinically, lipid abnormalities are common in patients with renal disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most frequent cause of death in these patients. Although the role of lipids in atherosclerotic disease has been well established, whether a similar effect of lipids occurs in the microvasculature of the kidney is unknown. Whether therapeutic approaches directed at reducing hyperlipidemia in patients with renal disease will provide a measure of renal protection, as has been seen in experimental models of renal disease, is also unknown.\r"

Second, this article examines recent studies that investigate how this secondary hyperlipidemia may further aggravate initial glomerular injury and contribute to a progressive glomerulopathy, primarily mediated through alterations in monocyte/macrophage function.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperlipidemia is usually present in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. The most common lipid abnormality is hypercholesterolemia, although as the disorder progresses, hypertriglyceridemia may develop. Elevated plasma lipids have two potential vascular consequences, namely, atherosclerosis and progression of renal failure. Neither of these complications has been proven with certainty, but there is growing evidence to indicate that both may be long-term consequences of the nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, effective therapy of hyperlipidemia, particularly elevated cholesterol levels, is needed as a protection against these complications. Since nephrotic hypercholesterolemia frequently is severe, dietary therapy, although a valuable adjunct, will not normalize cholesterol levels in most nephrotic patients. Thus, if effective serum cholesterol lowering is to be achieved, drug therapy will be required. Bile acid-binding resins have been shown to lower cholesterol levels in nephrotic patients, but the decline in cholesterol concentrations is usually insufficient to produce a marked reduction in coronary risk. Nicotinic acid theoretically should be useful for treatment of nephrotic hyperlipidemia, but it has not been adequately tested. The new drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis, e.g., lovastatin, appear to be highly promising for treating elevations of both serum cholesterol and triglycerides in the nephrotic syndrome. However, testing of these drugs in this condition has been limited, and the possibility of significant side effects in an appreciable portion of patients has not been ruled out. Of particular concern is the development of severe myopathy that can produce myoglobinuria and acute renal failure. This side effect is relatively rare in patients without the nephrotic syndrome, but its prevalence in the latter condition has not been determined. The fibric acids will lower triglyceride levels in nephrotic patients, but they are not effective in lowering cholesterol levels; consequently, they probably have little role in the treatment of nephrotic hypercholesterolemia. Finally, the drug probucol will lower cholesterol levels in nephrotic patients, although not to desirable levels; still, probucol could prove useful in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs.\r"

In this article, we briefly review the role of lipids in the pathogenesis of FSGHS and provide evidence that \"atherosclerosis of the glomerular mesangium\" contributes to the ultimate histopathologic lesion of FSGHS in susceptible rat strains. Observations in a FSGHS-resistant strain revealed several characteristic features that may protect these rats against chronic renal disease such as high nephron numbers, glomerular visceral epithelial cells with a remarkable resistance to toxic injury, minimal sequestration of serum proteins and cholesterol from the circulation into the mesangium, and a remarkable lipoprotein profile in normal as well as nephrotic states with a very low cholesterol content of the very-low-density and low-density lipoprotein fractions. Recent clinicopathologic studies also indicate a correlation between hyperlipidemia and the progression of renal disease. The concept of lipid-mediated glomerular injury warrants further study.\r"

  ".U": "91090142\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical and experimental observations suggest an association between hypercholesterolemia and progressive glomerular injury. In the main, most investigators have assumed that hypercholesterolemia induces an atherosclerotic process in the renal microvasculature analogous to that well recognized in larger vessels. The evidence for this line of reasoning is well described in other papers in this symposium. It is our belief that hypercholesterolemia may also lead to glomerular injury by hemodynamic mechanisms. In support of this latter view, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia often raises blood pressure in experimental animals and markedly impairs endothelial cell-dependent vascular relaxation in vitro. A high cholesterol diet also increases renal vascular resistance and contributes to glomerular capillary hypertension, a hemodynamic maladaptation known to cause glomerular sclerosis. In addition, hypercholesterolemia results in hyperviscosity, a rheologic abnormality leading to increased efferent arteriolar resistance and glomerular hypertension. The similar glomerular hemodynamic responses to two hyperviscosity states, elevated hematocrit and hypercholesterolemia, implicate efferent arteriolar hyperviscosity as a potential mechanism of injury common to hyperviscosity states. It therefore seems likely that as in atherosclerosis, multiple risk factors act synergistically to initiate glomerular structural injury. Specifically, we suggest that hypercholesterolemia and glomerular hypertension act synergistically to initiate structural injury. Although modification of either risk factor may limit injury, it seems likely that therapy targeted to each of multiple risk factors may afford superior protection.\r"

Despite the well-documented atherogenic toxicity of lipids in cardiovascular morbidity, little is known about lipid-associated renal injury. However, lipids are toxic to endothelium, and the glomerulus is a vascular bundle. Several authors participating in this symposium have presented evidence for an association between hyperlipidemia and glomerulosclerosis in animal models. This association is particularly significant given the expanded therapeutic armamentarium now available to treat hyperlipidemia. In fact, glomerular injury may be moderated by pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in a rat renal ablation model. Very little evidence exists, however, for a similar association in human renal disease. We have, in the course of clinical practice, made certain observations in renal biopsy specimens that may for the first time link atherogenesis and lipid deposition to human glomerular injury.\r"

They have elevated serum levels of very-low-density, intermediate-density, and low-density lipoprotein. Serum cholesterol levels are usually normal and those of high-density lipoprotein are low. It is generally accepted that hypertriglyceridemia is due to decreased removal from the blood secondary to reduced activity of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase. Secondary hyperparathyroidism and elevated blood levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the triglyceridemia of chronic renal failure. Indeed, parathyroidectomized-normocalcemic dogs with chronic renal failure have normal serum levels of triglyceride, normal fat tolerance, and normal post-heparin lipolytic activity. Available data indicate that the abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in chronic renal failure are linked. Excess PTH suppresses insulin release from pancreatic islets, and the insulin deficiency results in carbohydrate intolerance. Insulin deficiency also causes decreased synthesis of lipoprotein lipase and hence abnormal lipid metabolism. Thus, the hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal failure may play a paramount role in the genesis of the abnormal metabolism of both carbohydrates and lipids.\r"

However, the significance of these lipid abnormalities, the mechanisms producing them, and their potential treatment have all been a cause of debate. Recent data have helped clarify each of these areas of controversy. Studies of the lipoprotein abnormalities of patients with the uncomplicated nephrotic syndrome have shown that many will have elevated levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas only a few will have elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. If these lipid abnormalities have the same significance in this population as in other populations studied, then some patients with unremitting nephrotic syndrome will be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The elevated cholesterol levels noted in the nephrotic syndrome are caused primarily by enhanced hepatic synthesis, with lesser contributions by decreased clearance and altered enzyme activities. The signal for enhanced hepatic lipogenesis may relate to changes in plasma albumin concentration, plasma oncotic pressure, a local effect of viscosity at the hepatic sinusoidal level, or a loss of urinary proteins or other liporegulatory substances. Recently, a number of short-term studies in nephrotic patients have documented the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs such as the bile acid-binding resins, probucol, and the HMGCoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors.\r"

We examine this hypothetic role of lipids in a large population of patients on long-term dietary protein restriction. In our experience, there is no conclusive evidence that lipids may accelerate the progression of functional deterioration in patients with reduced renal function. Hyperlipidemia seems to be only one among the many factors affecting the prognosis of primary renal disease. Dietary protein restriction is effective in maintaining normal or only slightly elevated serum lipid levels in patients with early renal failure. Moreover, patients with renal failure maintained on this diet, which provides an elevated ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids, have a more favorable lipid composition of erythrocyte membrane (low percentage of saturated fatty acids and high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids) when compared with patients on an unrestricted diet.\r"

Proving a causal association between dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis in the end-stage renal disease population has been confounded by the presence of other pro-atherogenic conditions in this population. The current study compiles the lipid data we have accumulated from our renal population for the years 1987 to 1989. The report is divided into three main parts: The first is a survey of lipid levels and atherogenicity indicators in groups with different types of renal disease or modalities of treatment. The second is a multivariate analysis of the relationship of clinical and biochemical variables (and their interactions) to the serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels and their ratios and their change over time in a large dialysis population. In the third study, we quantitate the peritoneal clearances of apolipoproteins A-I and B in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and assess the relationship of these clearances to serum lipid and lipoprotein levels and risk ratios.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperlipidemia, long recognized as a difficult and common problem following organ transplantation, may be the underlying cause of the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in heart transplant recipients and children with renal transplants. In addition, hyperlipidemia may play a role in late renal graft loss. The cause of post-transplant hyperlipidemia is unclear. In patients treated with azathioprine and prednisone, hypertriglyceridemia is the commonest finding and probably results from an increased consumption of calories from carbohydrate and fat following resolution of uremia, in conjunction with glucose intolerance secondary to steroid administration. In patients treated with cyclosporine, hypercholesterolemia is the most common form of hyperlipidemia. Cyclosporine is a lipophilic drug that is transported in the plasma, largely in association with lipoproteins, and may require the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor for internalization into cells. Hypercholesterolemia may result from interference with the basic cholesterol feedback mechanism via the LDL receptor. In addition, cyclosporine affects bile acid synthesis and worsens glucose tolerance, both factors that may promote hyperlipidemia. The first therapeutic approach to hyperlipidemia in the transplant recipient is dietary calorie-fat restriction and supplementation with soluble fiber. Ongoing clinical trials of the available pharmacologic lipid-lowering agents are addressing the safety and efficacy of these agents in the setting of immunosuppression; until that time, they should be used cautiously and in low doses.\r"

The incomplete response to therapy of some forms of hypercholesterolemia as well as not uncommon drug intolerance prompted the development of extracorporeal techniques to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Nonhuman primate data and an analysis of human cholesterol epidemiology and reduction trials were used to establish guidelines that would maximize the likelihood of stabilizing or regressing established coronary artery atherosclerosis. These goals are a total cholesterol (TC) level of less than or equal to 150 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and a ratio of TC to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) of less than 2.8. Selective, extracorporeal removal of LDL cholesterol (LDL-pheresis) was combined with diet and hypolipidemic drugs in a pilot study at The Rogosin Institute to achieve these lipid end-points. Technical aspects of LDL-pheresis, the background rationale for its use as part of a combined hypolipidemic therapy, the initial experience at The Rogosin Institute, and plans for future studies and applications are presented.\r"

Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells. In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells. GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on HL-60 cells. Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), nitroso-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF. In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability. Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production. It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced aplastic anemia.\r"

Each patient underwent clinical evaluation during the 28-day period, as well as invasive hemodynamic studies on the first two and last two days of the trial. Plasma ACE activity and aldosterone levels fell significantly and renin levels rose after therapy. Benazepril HCl produced significant (p less than 0.01) reductions in arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, with corresponding increases in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Responses after 28 days of therapy were equivalent to those after the initial doses. Clinical effects included reduced rest, exertional and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, as well as reduced peripheral edema. Only one patient developed symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.

Compared with HbAA controls, HbSS subjects showed a three-fourfold increase in 24-hour urinary orotate excretion that had no relationship to amount of N intake. The results indicated that adult subjects with HbSS, who consumed adequate N and E as per the RDA for healthy individuals, behaved like normal HbAA controls on a low protein diet. There was evidence that the HbSS subject might be in a precarious state with respect to sufficiency of several amino acids, particularly L-Arg, which is now classified as conditionally indispensable for the human.\r"

Hemorrhagic tendencies correlate best with laboratory tests of bleeding times. The identification of a specific hemostatic defect and its role in bleeding dyscrasias has yet to be elucidated. Our studies demonstrate that factor VIII coagulant activity and factor VIII related antigen (vWF:Ag) are normal or greatly elevated in uremic renal failure patients with greatly prolonged bleeding times. The multimeric state of the von Willebrand factor is also normal in these patients. The bleeding times were normalized in all 15 patients, 90 minutes post-infusion with desmopressin (DDAVP). No significant changes in factor VIII/vWF associated properties, blood cell counts, or coagulation factors were observed post-DDAVP treatment. However, a significant increase in platelet serotonin uptake (p less than .025) and ATP release (p less than .025) was detected after DDAVP treatment. These results indicate that DDAVP acts on the platelet membrane. This is further substantiated by the ability of DDAVP to block vasopressin-induced platelet aggregation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Perturbations in the movement and storage of serotonin and the release of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in the platelets of uremic individuals are proposed to play a critical role in regulating bleeding times.\r"

  ".W": "A unique case of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency with steroid-responsive primary hyperaldosteronism is reported. Initially the patient was misdiagnosed as testicular feminization for 16 years and was thought to have typical primary hyperaldosteronism for 5 years. However, careful detailed endocrine studies showed markedly elevated progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone values with low levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, testosterone, and DHEA-Sulfate. In contrast to the suppressed aldosterone levels that are found in 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, this patient's aldosterone levels were inappropriately elevated before and after ACTH stimulation. Use of glucocorticoid replacement resolved the patient's symptoms and completely corrected the hypokalemia and hypertension. In summary, recognition of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency with steroid-responsive primary hyperaldosteronism is important because hypertension, hypokalemia, and symptoms respond to steroid replacement.\r"

The authors report the first description of a patient with classic KS to have bone marrow involvement. Two additional patients with KS variants and bone marrow involvement have been described. Bone marrow tumor invasion should be considered in patients with KS and hematologic abnormalities.\r"

This case and few qualifying previous reports which are reviewed support the possibility that pure self-induced water intoxication with no major contribution of inadequate release of antidiuretic hormone may occur, and that extreme polydipsia can sometimes overwhelm normal renal diluting capacity in psychotic patients.\r"

Of 105 males, 33 (31.4%) had lattice degeneration; of 113 females, 39 (34.5%) had lattice degeneration. Contrary to previously published data, we found an inverse relationship between axial length and the prevalence of lattice degeneration in severely myopic eyes. The greatest prevalence of lattice degeneration (63 of 154 eyes, 40.9%) was found in eyes with an axial length of 26.0 to 26.9 mm (-6.00 to -8.70 diopters), and the least prevalence of lattice degeneration (five of 71 eyes, 7.0%) was found in eyes with an axial length of 32.0 mm (-24.00 diopters) or greater.

The complications of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, deformation of the posterior retina, vitreous hemorrhage, amblyopia, and retinal detachment, caused diminished visual acuity. Of 170 eyes, retinal neovascularization was observed in 18 eyes (11%), and retinal exudates were observed in 16 eyes (9%). Several forms of retinal detachment occurred in 37 of 180 eyes (21%), which often took an unfavorable course. A falciform retinal fold was observed in 14 eyes (8%). Retinal surgery was performed in 14 eyes; reattachment of the retina was successful in only seven eyes. Platelet aggregation studies disclosed no significant differences between seven patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and ten control subjects.

Operative microscope illumination had been eliminated by corneal shielding, which implicated endoillumination as the source of injury. We recommend the following procedures to avoid this complication: careful planning of vitreous surgery for epimacular membrane removal; using filters; minimizing the length of surgery; keeping the light output low; maintaining maximal light pipe distance from the retina; eccentric orientation of the light pipe; and use of intermittent and variable site illumination techniques.\r"

Factors associated with the stability or progression of glaucoma were evaluated. Eyes with mean intraocular pressure higher than 21 mm Hg during the follow-up period uniformly had progressive glaucomatous changes. Conversely, eyes with mean intraocular pressure less than 17 mm Hg remained stable, and approximately half of the eyes with mean intraocular pressure between 17 and 21 mm Hg had progressive glaucomatous changes. Patients who remained stable were slightly younger than those with progressive glaucomatous changes (P less than .05), but initial optic nerve head appearance, initial visual field findings, number of medicines used, medical history, and patient gender or race were not statistically associated with stability or progression of the glaucoma. These findings reinforce the importance of intraocular pressure control in primary open-angle glaucoma and the need to identify other markers that help determine the proper level of intraocular pressure for individual patients.\r"

None of the patients had a history of glaucoma, narrow angles, or any precondition for a pupillary block mechanism. Two patients survived and neither had optic nerve damage or increased intraocular pressure after hospital discharge. Tonometry should be performed in patients with severe burns and orbital congestion, especially in those patients receiving large amounts of intravenous fluids. Lateral canthotomies may be of benefit to relieve potentially damaging high intraocular pressure.\r"

When all users were considered together, Perkins tonometry produced a mean intraocular pressure increase of 0.7 mm Hg, significantly less than the mean increase of 12.1 mm Hg produced by Tono-Pen tonometry (P less than .05) or the mean increase of 16.5 mm Hg produced by Schiotz tonometry (P less than .01). There was no statistically significant difference between the intraocular pressure increase produced by Tono-Pen or Schiotz tonometry. Tonometry performed by inexperienced Tono-Pen users and experienced or inexperienced Schiotz users produced a significantly greater increase in intraocular pressure than that performed by experienced Tono-Pen users (P less than .05), and an extremely significant increase compared to tonometry performed by experienced or inexperienced Perkins users (P less than .01). The marked increase in intraocular pressure produced by Tono-Pen tonometry suggests that hand-held electronic applanation tonometers should be used with caution in eyes with a weakened cornea or sclera.\r"

The lenses were then photographed and analyzed with this new device, and the results were compared. The camera system showed good reproducibility. Its results correlated well with the clinical gradings for nuclear capacity (P = .001) and cortical opacity (P = .001) but less well with posterior subcapsular opacity (P = .3), although there were only seven eyes with posterior subcapsular opacities. This camera system could help document and follow up lens opacity with more accuracy and reproducibility than has been previously possible.\r"

Distinct receptors for acetoacetylated low-density lipoprotein internalize oxidized or enzymatically modified low-density lipoprotein and extracellular matrix components. We identified low-density lipoprotein receptors on cultured human and monkey corneal endothelial cells by the avid incorporation of fluorescently labeled low-density lipoprotein that was competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled low-density lipoprotein but not by unlabeled acetoacetylated low-density lipoprotein. Specific uptake of labeled low-density lipoprotein was greatest in nonconfluent, growing cells and increased after low-density lipoprotein deprivation. Intact endothelial monolayers of whole human cornea also incorporated low-density lipoprotein but not acetoacetylated low-density lipoprotein. After scratch injury of human corneas, spreading endothelium adjacent to areas of cell loss internalized more fluorescent low-density lipoprotein than cells distant from the injury. Blood-aqueous barrier breakdown occurring in ocular diseases and after surgical and nonsurgical trauma may allow leakage of circulating low-density lipoprotein, which provides a rich supply of lipid and protein for endothelial use. Efficient, receptor-mediated, low-density lipoprotein uptake may facilitate repair of damaged corneal endothelial membranes and regeneration of intact, functional cell monolayers.\r"

The most common predisposing cause of ulceration was corneal trauma, usually with organic agricultural materials. Microorganisms were grown from 324 (80%) of the ulcers. Pure bacterial cultures were obtained from 256 (63.2%) of the patients, whereas pure fungal cultures were obtained from 27 (6.7%) of the patients. In 41 patients (10.1%), corneal cultures yielded a mixed growth of bacteria and fungi. Of a total of 398 bacterial isolates, 124 (31.1%) were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most commonly isolated organism in the series. Other frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Pseudomonas species. Of 68 positive fungal isolates obtained, 32 (47.0%) were identified as Aspergillus species. Candida species and Fusarium species were less commonly seen.\r"

Results on a battery of intellectual and neuropsychological tests indicated large and significant differences between alcohol-affected children and controls. FAS differed significantly from controls on measures of intellectual abilities, while FAE did not; FAS mean scores on these measures were significantly lower than FAE means. For neuropsychological measures, FAS were significantly poorer than controls on most measures, while FAE showed deficits compared with controls only on grip strength. The results suggest that neuropsychological measures would be a valuable supplement to intellectual measures for the purpose of assessing alcohol effects because they are less vulnerable than intellectual measures to the influence of cultural and educational experiences.\r"

Maternal reports of alcohol use obtained during pregnancy were significantly related to child IQ, achievement test scores, and classroom behaviors in second grade children, even after statistical adjustment for appropriate covariates. Consumption of two drinks per day or more on the average was related to a 7-point decrement in IQ in 7-year-old children even after statistically adjusting for appropriate covariates. Low paternal education and more children in the household were identified as environmental factors exacerbating the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on child IQ. Learning problems were associated with the alcohol \"BINGE\" pattern of five or more drinks on at least one occasion. This study shows that alcohol use patterns within the social drinking range can have long lasting effects on IQ and learning problems in young school aged children. These patterns should not be interpreted as biologic thresholds. It should also be noted that these are group effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, not necessarily predictable in the individual child, and that for the most part these children were functioning within the normal range of intelligence.\r"

It is not meant as a comprehensive review, but rather focuses on selected studies. It is concluded that prenatal alcohol exposure does have long lasting effects, although some of these might only occur under challenging or stressful circumstances. It is hypothesized that as the animal matures compensatory mechanisms or strategies develop to compensate for these dysfunctions. Thus, behavioral problems may only be detected when these compensatory systems break down, either as a result of stress, because of complex testing procedures, or old age.\r"

Thirty-three live born infants were assessed for abnormalities of physical and behavioral development. Ocular pathology, neuropathologic and neurochemical assessements were done on 31 animals at 6 months postnatal age. Microphthalmia was noted in three of the 26 animals exposed to ethanol. Retinal ganglion cell loss was significantly associated with intra-uterine ethanol exposure. Microphthalmia and retinal ganglion cell loss was observed in both the delayed and full-gestational exposed animals. No structural anomalies were found in the brains via gross inspection or light microscopy. Chemical abnormalities in the striatal nuclei were identified. Striatal dopamine concentrations increased with increasing MPPEC exposure (0-249 mg/dl) among animals exposed weekly to ethanol throughout gestation. Striatal dopamine concentrations decreased with increasing MPPEC exposure (260-540 mg/dl) among animals whose weekly exposure to ethanol was delayed until the 5th week of gestation. The same pattern of association was also noted between MPPEC and ultrastructural alterations in the caudate nucleus. The extent of ultrastructural alterations increased with increasing MPPEC among the full-gestational exposed animals and decreased with increasing MPPEC among the delayed-dose animals.\r"

To reach these goals, three objectives are described. First, animal and human research must become more interrelated. Second, experimental observations should be integrated into formal models that incorporate both neural structure and function. Third, researchers should choose well-defined dependent measures that are derived from models of brain function based on modern concepts of cognitive neuroscience. Examples of neuropsychological tests that may serve as the bases for structure/function relationships are presented. Incorporating these objectives into future research will facilitate understanding of the fundamental issues concerning prenatal alcohol exposure and will begin to provide the bases for rational intervention or treatment.\r"

SAAST scores ranged from 2 to 26 with a mean score of 10.8. Forty-eight percent (10/21) had SAAST scores greater than or equal to 10, indicating \"probable alcoholism\"; 62% (13/21) scored 8 or higher. Every patient with a SAAST score of 8 or higher also met DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence on the basis of patient interview, independent chart reviews, and interviews of significant others. In contrast, only half (5/10) of the high SAAST scorers would actually admit to a problem with drinking during the extensive study interviews. Six SAAST items were found to be highly predictive of abuse or alcoholism; the SAAST had greater sensitivity than the interviews. Sixty-two percent (8 of 13) of the schizophrenic patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol abuse reported a first degree relative with an alcohol-related problem, in contrast to only 25% of the \"nonalcoholic\" patients. The patterns of the alcoholic schizophrenic patients' responses on the different SAAST items revealed even greater denial and lack of insight than those of nonschizophrenic alcoholic subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of clinically relevant ethanol concentrations on myeloid differentiation in the HL-60 cell promyelocytic leukemia line have been studied. The exposure of noninduced stem cells to 60 mM ethanol results in an increase in G1 cells, but there is no increase in superoxide production or expression of the Mo1 antigen. When HL-60 cells are induced to differentiate along the myeloid line with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), there is a shift to smaller cell size, an increase in G1 cells and acquisition of the ability to produce superoxide as reported previously by several authors. When ethanol is present during differentiation, there are further increases in G1 cells, and increases in the percentage of cells which produce superoxide and express Mo1, and decreases in mean cell size and total growth during the incubation period. Regrowth experiments after periods of differentiation indicate that the increased G1 arrest seen in the presence of ethanol represents terminal commitment if inducer is present, but in the absence of inducer the increased G1 percentage is readily reversible. Examination of RNA content by flow cytometry reveals a decrease in both the peak and mean G1 RNA content during DMSO or RA induced differentiation. These decreases are accentuated by the presence of ethanol, resulting in a higher G1A/G1B ratio than in nonexposed cells. These findings indicate that ethanol enhances G1 growth arrest in HL-60 cells exposed to myeloid inducers. Partial differentiation occurs during this process, resulting in terminally arrested cells, some of which have undergone fewer postinduction cell divisions than normal and may not be fully competent.\r"

These response differences are thought to reflect differences in vulnerability to dependence on alcohol. Thus, the role of positive family alcoholism history in increasing risk of addiction to a variety of drug classes might be studied by determining whether FHP subjects show different responses to drug classes other than alcohol. This was done in the present study by determining dose-effect functions for a variety of physiological (heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature), subjective (analog mood and drug effect, Subjective High Assessment Scale), and psychomotor measures (hand tremor, body sway, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, eye-hand coordination, and numeric recall) in FHP and FHN college-aged males for secobarbital (0, 100, 200 mg by mouth) and ethanol (1 g/kg). FHP and FHN subjects were matched on light-to-moderate drinking patterns, anthropometric dimensions, age, years of schooling, and drug use. At equivalent blood alcohol levels family-history positive subjects reported greater effects of ethanol than did family-history negative subjects on almost all subjective measures. Following the high dose of secobarbital, FHP but not FHN subjects showed elevated subjective effects; these effects were substantially less and were evident in fewer measures than following ethanol. In contrast to effects on the subjective measures, ethanol and secobarbital produced comparable impairment in both groups of subjects for most psychomotor responses. Group differences were not obtained on any physiological measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Detectable levels of acetaldehyde were found in each sample in both drinking and nondrinking pigs.

A two-bottle consumption test was then given for a 3-week period to allow the rats access to 10% alcohol. After the preference test, a second taste reactivity test was done using the same solutions as in the initial reactivity test. The results indicated no significant differences in taste reactivity between P rats and NP rats on the initial exposure, except that NP rats made significantly more mouth movements. During the two-bottle tests, consumption of alcohol by P rats was consistently higher than that of NP rats across all test days. On the second taste reactivity test, P rats showed an increase in the number of ingestive responses and a decrease in the number of aversive responses to alcohol. NP rats' taste reactivity to alcohol remained unchanged from Exposure 1 to Exposure 2. P rats' and NP rats' responses to sucrose and quinine did not change from Exposure 1 to Exposure 2. It was concluded that there were no innate taste response differences between P and NP rats to alcohol but that following alcohol experience, P rats showed a significant increase in ingestive responses and a concomitant decrease in aversive responses to the taste of alcohol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We present here the results of a study about the acute effects of ethanol on serotonergic raphe nucleus, noradrenergic locus coeruleus, and dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. These nuclei were investigated electrophysiologically by recording the spontaneous firing rate of single neurons using glass microelectrodes, both in vivo in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats and in vitro in brain slices. Ethanol was perfused intravenously at a rate ranging from 0.2 mg/kg/min to 0.2 g/kg/min in vivo, and at concentrations between 10(-8) M and 1 M in vitro. We observed that each monoaminergic nucleus had its own pattern of responses to acute ethanol perfusion, and that high and low concentrations have different actions, suggesting a biphasic effect. For example, in slices, ethanol concentrations higher than 10 mM induce an excitation in most raphe and ventral tegmental area neurons, and an inhibition of firing in locus coeruleus neurons. The results were comparable in the in vivo model, but much more heterogenous. We conclude that the effect of ethanol on the monoaminergic neurons is specific of the type of neuron, and that a biphasic effect is commonly found.\r"

The inhibitory effect of 50 mM ethanol increased with the duration of exposure, with 2DG uptake inhibited by 36% after 18 hr. Astrocytes cultured from the brains of term fetuses of rats fed ethanol during pregnancy showed essentially the same 2DG uptake response to in vitro ethanol treatment. Kinetics of 2DG uptake showed a significant decrease of Vmax in the presence of ethanol. No interaction was found between ethanol and insulin, which stimulated 2DG uptake and protein content of the cultures. The data suggest that ethanol can modulate hexose uptake by astrocytes cultured from fetal rat brain. However, insulin actions on glial cells were not affected by ethanol.\r"

Alcoholics performed significantly poorer than controls on NP tests. Male alcoholics had significantly altered ERP responses (N1, NdA, and P3 amplitudes) but female alcoholics did not differ on any ERP variables from controls. A number of significant correlations between ERP and NP measures were present. The most consistent findings were positive correlations between perceptual-motor (PM) tests and the P3 amplitude at Pz in both male and female alcoholics and in male alcoholics, a negative correlation between PM tests and P3 latency at Pz, findings similar to those seen in Parkinson patients. Significant correlations were most numerous in family history positive alcoholics. The results lead to two conclusions: first, Grant's postulation that sober alcoholics may manifest an intermediate duration organic mental disorder is supported; second, given the lack of ERP differences in the females, ERP measures should not be considered as being causally related to NP performance.\r"

Patients' and collaterals' responses on the AAAI and the SAAST were compared through the use of a paired t test. Results indicated no significant differences between patients' self-reports compared with collateral reports, and demonstrated a direct relationship on the AAAI (two tailed p less than 0.001) and SAAST (two-tailed p less than 0.001). Self-reports of patients who volunteered collaterals compared with self-reports of patients who did not volunteer collaterals also showed no significant differences on the AAAI or the SAAST, demonstrating consistency of reporting whether the patients believed their reports would be compared with information provided by a collateral or not. The AAAI and the SAAST corroborated in their diagnoses of patients as suffering from alcoholism (r = 0.515, p less than 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed no significant effect of demographic variables on either the AAAI or the SAAST. This study shows: (a) impressive concordance between patient and collateral reports; (2) apparent intactness of memory, and little evidence of denial, as measured by the instruments; and (3) the efficacy of measures such as the AAAI and the SAAST, two vastly different scales measuring dimensions of alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the site of two major effects of ethanol. In humans, ethanol produces a slow damped oscillation in the steady electrical potential of the eye, which is generated primarily by the RPE. It has also been shown that ethanol potentiates the reversible, depolarizing effect of blue light on the transepithelial potential (TEP) of the isolated RPE. The present study demonstrates that in addition to the depolarizing effect of blue light on the TEP, a secondary, compensatory potential arises, which functions to maintain the TEP. The magnitude of the secondary response varies somewhat among preparations. It appears that ethanol eliminates or reduces the secondary, compensatory potential change which results in a large depolarization of the TEP when the RPE is irradiated with blue light. Microelectrode studies reveal that ethanol hyperpolarizes both the apical and basal membranes of the RPE with a greater effect noted in the apical membrane. This would account for the corneal positive potential elicited by ethanol in the human eye. Brief exposures (2-3 min) of blue light, after administration of 0.5% ethanol, results in a large (25-30 mV) depolarization of both membrane potentials as compared with 3 to 5 mV in untreated tissue. On the basis of our observations, it is hypothesized that some of the potentiating effects of ethanol in combination with other agents may result from an interference with a cellular adaptive response to impaired respiration rather than an additive effect on a common mechanism.\r"

These protein-AAs reported thus far include a 37KD protein-AA in liver cytosol, cytP450IIE 1-AA in hepatic microsomes, hemoglobin-AA, and serum protein-AAs. It has been postulated that acetaldehyde or perhaps a reactive acetaldehyde radical generated by the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS or cytP450IIE1) explains the formation of the cytP450IIE1-AA. The source of acetaldehyde responsible for the formation of the cytosolic 37KD protein-AA has not been determined. In this report, we have examined the effects of pyrazole (an ADH inhibitor) and cyanamide (an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) on the formation of the 37KD liver protein-AA in vivo and in vitro. It was found that feeding rats with an alcohol-containing liquid diet supplemented with cyanamide enhanced while a diet supplemented with pyrazole completely abolished the formation of the 37KD liver protein-AA. The liver of rats fed the pyrazole supplemented alcohol-containing diet showed significantly higher content of cytP450IIE1 than that of rats fed the diet containing alcohol alone. On the other hand, feeding the cyanamide supplemented alcohol-containing liquid diet did not further enhance the content of cytP450IIE1. Similarly, adding cyanamide to the culture medium enhanced while adding 4-methylpyrazole inhibited the production of the 37KD protein-AA by cultured hepatocytes even though the combination of alcohol and 4-methylpyrazole increased the content of cytP450IIE1 2-fold over that in control cells. These results demonstrate that the formation of the 37KD liver Protein-AA is dependent on ADH and not on MEOS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Pups were removed from the dams at 0800 hr. An extension tube filled with heparinized saline was attached to the catheter at 1300 hr. At 1400 hr, a preinfusion (PRE 0) blood sample was removed and was followed by infusion of saline (control) or alcohol in saline (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 g/kg body weight doses) solutions. Following the removal of a postinfusion (POST 0) blood sample, pups were returned to the mother. Subsequent blood samples were obtained 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min after initiation of suckling. In separate groups, the effects of alcohol on basal PRL were studied by collecting blood samples PRE 0, POST 0 and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min following infusion of saline or alcohol in saline to lactating rats also separated from their pups for 6 hr. Alcohol infusion did not alter basal PRL.

This was evaluated on the basis of blood pressure, cardiac output respiratory rate, blood flow to organs, and survival for 4 hr after hemorrhage. Four groups of six swine per group were used (control, intoxicated, hemorrhage, and intoxicated-hemorrhage). The results revealed that blood alcohol concentrations near 0.1% greatly reduced tolerance to hemorrhage. Intoxicated animals subjected to hemorrhage were unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output, blood pressure, or respiratory rate to sustain life. Pigs tolerated higher blood alcohol concentrations, up to 0.35%, when not exposed to hemorrhage. Also, unintoxicated pigs were able to compensate for severe hemorrhage. Only one of the six pigs in the intoxicated-hemorrhage group survived for 4 hr after hemorrhage. In conclusion the body's ability to compensate and recover from hemorrhage was greatly reduced during intoxication. It is logical to assume that the ability to overcome numerous other stressors may also be reduced during intoxication.\r"

  ".W": "Ethanol may have profound effects on both the distribution of perfusion and substrate utilization by the liver and heart due to its vasodilating properties and the generation of high levels of circulating acetate and lactate. Since fatty acids are highly extracted by the heart and liver under normal circumstances, changes in the relationship of perfusion/fatty acid uptake may be a sensitive indicator of both altered perfusion and changes in metabolic substrate availability. To test this hypothesis, studies were performed in rats fed 3.1, 6.2, and 9.3 g/kg doses of ethanol. Fatty acid uptake was estimated with a 3-methyl substituted reagent with a chain length equivalent to 17 carbons. The methyl group in the three position prevented beta oxidation and prolonged the residence of fatty acids in the tissue. Eighteen hours after acute alcohol administration, fatty acid uptake was reduced in the heart and the small intestine; in the liver uptake was increased or unchanged. Acute ethanol administration also resulted in increased perfusion, as indicated by enhanced uptake of 201thallium by the heart, liver, and small intestine. The fatty acid extraction of the heart, liver, and small intestine, defined as the concentration of fatty acid divided by the concentration of 201thallium, was markedly decreased by alcohol ingestion. These alcohol effects were dose-dependent and temporally related. The data suggest that ethanol ingestion could potentially alter heart function during exercise or following a prolonged fast, when the heart relies primarily upon fatty acids extracted from the circulation to generated adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\r"

Nine patients had normal renal and liver functions and were undergoing a variety of surgical procedures, nine were undergoing cadaveric kidney transplantation because of end-stage renal disease, and nine were undergoing cadaveric liver transplantation because of end-stage hepatocellular disease. Plasma concentrations of doxacurium were measured for 6 h after administration using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatographic assay. Plasma concentration versus time data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method based on statistical moments. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by measuring the electromyographic evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The degree of neuromuscular blockade after doxacurium administration was described as the percent of control of the first train-of-four response. The pharmacokinetic variables were (normal vs hepatic failure vs renal failure, respectively): volume of distribution at steady state (220 +/- 110 vs 290 +/- 60 vs 270 +/- 130 mL/kg [mean +/- SD]), plasma clearance (2.7 +/- 1.6 vs 2.3 +/- 0.4 vs 1.2 +/- 0.7 mL.kg-1.min-1), mean residence time (95.2 +/- 57 vs 129.4 +/- 30 vs 270 +/- 210 min), and elimination half-life (99 +/- 54 vs 115 +/- 31 vs 221 +/- 156 min). Plasma clearance and mean residence time differed significantly between patients with renal failure and control patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several lines of evidence suggest that leukotrienes may be mediators of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, the effect of leukotriene inhibition on HPV remains controversial. The present study investigated the effect of leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade on HPV in the halothane-anesthetized sheep. After initial baseline measurements, the pulmonary pressor response to 15 min of global hypoxia (FIO2 = 0.13) was measured. A second set of baseline measurements was obtained and the sheep then received the combined cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor BW755C, the selective lipoxygenase inhibitor U60257, or the leukotriene receptor antagonist LY171883. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained after drug administration and during a subsequent hypoxic challenge (FIO2 = 0.13). Initial hypoxic challenge increased pulmonary artery pressure 68% and increased pulmonary vascular resistance 104%. Pulmonary hemodynamics after recovery from hypoxia were similar to initial baseline values. Drug administration had no significant hemodynamic effect. Hypoxic challenge after drug administration resulted in a pulmonary pressor response identical to the initial hypoxic challenge. Because leukotriene synthesis inhibition and receptor blockade did not alter the response to hypoxia, we conclude that leukotrienes are not obligatory mediators of HPV. A critical review of the literature supports a modulatory rather than an obligatory role for leukotrienes in HPV.\r"

  ".W": "The intracranial and systemic hemodynamic effects of sufentanil (20 micrograms/kg) were studied in 10 mongrel dogs. Baseline anesthesia was maintained with 0.7% end-tidal isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Catheters were inserted for blood pressure measurement, arterial and sagittal sinus blood sampling, radioactive microsphere injections, and intracranial pressure monitoring. Blood flow velocity was measured continuously in the middle cerebral artery using a transtemporal approach through a cranial window with a pulsed 8 MHz transcranial Doppler system (TCD). Cardiac output was measured using an electromagnetic flow probe on the pulmonary artery. After baseline measurements, sufentanil was injected and data were recorded at 5, 15, and 30 min. In group 1 (n = 5) blood pressure was not controlled, whereas in group 2 (n = 5) blood pressure was maintained at baseline levels with a phenylephrine infusion. Sufentanil decreased blood pressure from 120 +/- 10 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 82 +/- 11 mm Hg in group 1. Cardiac output decreased 40%-50% in both groups. Intracranial pressure did not change. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and TCD blood flow velocity decreased significantly (35%-40%) with no difference between groups. Relative decreases in CBF and TCD blood flow velocity were closely correlated (r = 0.82). The cerebral hemodynamic changes were associated with a 35%-40% decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption. We conclude that sufentanil decreases CBF in response to decreased metabolic demand without significantly affecting intracranial pressure. Relative changes in CBF can be reproducibly monitored using TCD.\r"

The cuffed end of each tracheal tube was inserted into the neck of an empty flask, and the tube and flask were flushed with oxygen for 5 min before cuff inflation. Ten tracheal tubes had their cuffs inflated with air, and 10 were inflated with saline. A Lasersonics LS880 CO2 laser, set to 5 W for five of each of the two types of filled cuffs and to 40 W for the other pair of five tubes, was fired continuously at the cuffs for up to 1 min. No combustion occurred at the 5-W setting. The times to cuff perforation when the laser was set at 5 W were (mean +/- SD) 1.00 +/- 0.83 and 4.21 +/- 3.91 s for the air- and saline-filled cuffs, respectively, a difference that was not statistically significant. The time to deflation of the saline-filled cuff (104.6 +/- 67.5 s) was, however, significantly longer than that of the air-filled cuff (2.59 +/- 1.97 s). When the tracheal tube cuffs were exposed to 40-W laser radiation, the cuff and adjacent tube shaft ignited in all cases when the cuffs were inflated with air, but only in one of five cases when the cuffs were filled with saline (P less than 0.05). The filling of tracheal tube cuffs with saline provides simple, moderately effective partial protection of the cuff of endotracheal tubes during CO2 laser airway surgery.\r"

In our study, anesthesia was maintained with halothane in an air-oxygen mixture. After the surgical procedure was completed, the inspired concentration of halothane was adjusted to zero and the end-expired concentrations were permitted to decrease spontaneously. The end-expired concentration at which the child spontaneously opened his or her eyes was recorded. There were no statistically significant differences in the values of the end-expired halothane concentration at eye opening between patients in the control group, who did not receive any supplementation of halothane anesthesia, and patients in the groups that received either morphine supplementation or regional analgesia. These data suggest that analgesia and hypnosis (or loss of consciousness) occur by different mechanisms during halothane anesthesia in children.\r"

Strips of normal rat diaphragm were challenged with succinylcholine and halothane (halothane: 1% and 3%) subsequent to either in vitro administration (10-100 microM) or in vivo pretreatment (0.35-2.80 mg/kg) with droperidol, haloperidol, or trifluoperazine. After equilibration, maximum increases in tension were recorded and mean data analyzed by analysis of variance (P less than 0.05). When either droperidol or trifluoperazine was administered in vivo, contracture values after exposure to succinylcholine and halothane were significantly decreased. After in vivo pretreatment with haloperidol or in vitro administration of droperidol, succinylcholine-induced contractures were significantly reduced; contractures subsequently induced by halothane did not significantly differ from that of controls. In vitro treatment with haloperidol and trifluoperazine, however, produced significant increases in tension in muscles exposed to succinylcholine and halothane. This study provides evidence that droperidol may be considered a safe anesthetic adjunct in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients, and, additionally, that caution should be exercised when interpreting results from studies in which contracture testing is performed on muscle from patients treated with neuroleptic agents.\r"

Neuromuscular blockade was continuously recorded using the ulnar evoked electromyogram. Using the log probit method, ED95 was 268 micrograms/kg, ED90 was 251 micrograms/kg, and ED50 was 144 micrograms/kg. The time until 80% blockade was 1.9 min at 240 micrograms/kg, and the average time to peak effect was 4.6 min, which did not vary with dose. The clinical duration (injection until T1 returned to 25%) was 20.5 min, and the recovery index (T1 increased from 25% to 75% of control) was 15.4 min, after a total dose of 300 micrograms/kg. The duration of 75-micrograms/kg and 100-micrograms/kg repeat (maintenance) dose was 14.6 and 17.8 min, respectively, and no cumulative effect was apparent after as many as five maintenance doses. No cardiovascular side effects were seen at doses used in the study. We conclude that ORG 9426 is a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant with a rapid onset and short duration of action that deserves further clinical evaluation.\r"

In the present study, hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured in 10 cardiac patients undergoing catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, before and after sedation with intravenous diazepam, and after reversal of sedation with flumazenil. A sleep dose of diazepam (12.2 +/- 5.1 mg, mean +/- SD) caused only slight decreases in mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 12 to 98 +/- 14 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13.2 +/- 6.3 to 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (20.8 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in respiratory gas homeostasis. Intravenous flumazenil (0.22 +/- 0.07 mg) resulted in spontaneous awakening and return to full orientation, yet caused no significant alteration in either hemodynamic or respiratory variables measured. Reversal of diazepam-induced sedation by flumazenil in cardiac patients appears safe and effective.\r"

Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl, midazolam, and/or thiopental, and nitrous oxide for 30 min, after which 1% sevoflurane and 0.4% isoflurane in 65% nitrous oxide were administered for 30 min. Inspired, end-tidal, and mixed-expired gas samples were collected during administration and for 5-7 days of elimination. To measure percutaneous loss, each subject's arm was enclosed in a glass cylinder sealed at both ends and with two ports, one for flushing with nitrogen and one for obtaining gas samples during the 30 min of administration and the first 150 min of elimination. Anesthetic concentrations in all samples were determined using gas chromatography. The surface area of the arm was measured and the total surface area was calculated. During administration and elimination, percutaneous loss of isoflurane was significantly greater than that of sevoflurane (P less than 0.05). For both volatile agents, losses during elimination were greater than during administration (P less than 0.05), but even when combined, these losses were too small to affect kinetic or metabolic studies based on mass balance.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine, in two studies, the magnitude of this difference and to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs. In the first study, preinduction K+ (3.6 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, mean +/- SD) was significantly lower than K+ levels measured during routine preoperative testing (4.4 +/- 0.4 mEq/L, n = 47, P less than 0.001). Twenty-three patients (49%) had preinduction K+ levels that were considered hypokalemic (less than or equal to 3.5 mEq/L), but 22 of these 23 patients had normal preoperative K+ levels. The second study tested the hypothesis that preinduction decreases in serum K+ are mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Preinduction K+ changes were determined in patients given a single preoperative dose of propranolol (beta 1/beta 2-antagonist), atenolol (beta 1-antagonist), or no beta-blocker (control). The difference between preoperative and preinduction serum K+ in patients receiving propranolol (0.1 +/- 0.4 mEq/L) was significantly attenuated (P less than 0.02) compared with the difference in control subjects (0.5 +/- 0.4 mEq/L), but was not significantly different from controls in patients pretreated with atenolol (0.3 +/- 0.4 mEq/L). These results demonstrate that serum K+ levels measured intraoperatively just before anesthetic induction are consistently and significantly less than those measured 1-3 days preoperatively. The ability of propranolol but not atenolol to block this change suggests that the acute decrease in K+ levels was due to beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Tenectomy of the homolateral superior oblique, alone or in combination with a weakening procedure on the homolateral inferior oblique, has been the technique most advocated. However, good functional results are rarely achieved in a single procedure, and delayed complications are frequent. Taking advantage of the improved dissection and reduced trauma afforded by the use of a surgical microscope, one of the techniques first recommended and later abandoned by Brown was reappraised. The technique consists of dissection of the sheath and attachments of the superior oblique, while preserving its tendon, combined with a 10mm tuck of the homolateral inferior oblique. Both a typical and a severe atypical congenital case, according to the classification of Brown, were treated in this fashion. Full correction was achieved in both.\r"

The infants were initially diagnosed with various ocular disorders including cortical blindness (eight), optic nerve hypoplasia (six), congenital cataract (two), and retinopathy of prematurity (one). Standard optotype visual-acuity determinations were available in the follow-up records of 11 children (21 eyes), and fixation behavior was obtained in the remaining 16 children (32 eyes). Results revealed that pattern-reversal VER P1 latency was predictive (87%) of whether visual acuity was equal to (or better than) or worse than 20/100 and whether a patient would have good fixation behavior (fix and follow, FF) or poor fixation (no FF) (86%) (P less than .001). Although flash VER P1 latency was also predictive of later visual acuity or good fixation (73%), it was not statistically significant. Pattern VER P1 amplitude and flash VER P1 amplitude were not predictive of later visual function. The predictive power of pattern VER P1 latency for later visual function probably relates to its reflection of macular function and low variability. An analysis of the variability of each of the four VER factors in normal infants (n = 50) indicated that pattern VER P1 latency was the least variable, and consequently most sensitive, VER factor for detecting and quantifying pathology. Overall, the results of this retrospective study suggest that pattern VER P1 latency may have important predictive power for later visual function in infants with an initially abnormal ophthalmologic examination.\r"

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography effectively demonstrated the cricoarytenoid subluxation, which was confirmed by intraoperative electromyography (EMG) showing normal electrical activity in the thyroarytenoid muscle. Photographs from preoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy are presented to identify the appearance of arytenoid subluxation. Computed tomographic findings and photographs from laryngoscopy of two patients with RLNP documented by intraoperative EMG evaluation are presented to help distinguish the clinical appearance of this disorder from arytenoid subluxation.

A patient who developed recurring adductor spasms 1 year after nerve section was reexplored, with identification of neural regrowth into the distal segment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The technique of neural avulsion removing the distal nerve up to its insertion into the laryngeal muscles is described. Neural regrowth, which is just one of the possible mechanisms for recurrence of spastic dysphonia, should be prevented by this surgical modification. Twelve patients who have undergone neural avulsion primarily for spastic dysphonia are being followed up without recurrence of symptoms thus far. Although these results appear promising, this short follow-up that averages 1.5 years must be extended to firmly support these concepts.\r"

The threshold level to induce enough vocal cord adduction reached the maximum at 2 weeks after nerve injury, decreased with time, and never surpassed 7 V in each case. On the basis of results of these preliminary probings, laryngeal pacing was conducted on a dog 15 months after resection of the laryngeal nerve. Adduction of the paralyzed vocal cord for synchrony with the intact cord was achieved by 7 V of electrical stimulation of the thyroarytenoid muscle that was triggered by signals from the cricothyroid muscle.\r"

What happens to the pharyngeal walls between the soft palate and the larynx when the fundamental frequency is raised? How does the soft palate participate in pitch raising? To answer these questions, the present study was undertaken with the recently described simultaneous velolaryngeal endoscopy technique. Nine professional singers were asked to find the limits of their vocal range in any of six voice qualities: speech, falsetto, cry/sob, twang, belting, and opera. Simultaneous activities of the larynx, the pharyngeal walls, and the soft palate were submitted to videoendoscopy with synchronous voice recording and studied with spectroanalysis of discrete segments of the total phonation range. Our dual endoscopic study showed that 1) the larynx rose in all subjects with the production of higher frequencies, 2) with the highest fundamental frequency, the lateral pharyngeal walls significantly contracted toward the midline in an \"upside-down V shape,\" creating a very narrow pharyngeal tube, and 3) the soft palate lifted and the velopharyngeal port narrowed considerably with higher frequencies.\r"

When combined with volatile anesthetic mixtures, electrosurgery has caused ignition of plastic, rubber, paper, enteric gases, and combustible preparation solutions. We report on an intubated patient whose polyvinyl chloride endotracheal tube ignited during a tracheotomy performed with an electrosurgical unit. The oxygen-rich environment, the polyvinyl chloride tube, and the heat generated by the electrosurgical unit combined to produce a fire. Since otolaryngologists are called upon often to perform tracheotomies on intubated patients, it is imperative that they understand the factors involved in the development of such a fire. This case is presented with an explanation of why this type of fire occurs. A brief review of the literature is included. Different kinds of electrosurgical units, precautions as to their use, and the management of electrosurgery-induced endotracheal tube fires are also discussed.\r"

Laryngeal response to exercise was determined by measuring the area of the glottic aperture before, during, and after exercise. The glottis was visualized with a flexible laryngoscope and video images were recorded during monitoring of respirations. Asthma was induced in subjects by having them exercise on an ergometer for 10 minutes while breathing dry air at 10 degrees C. Measurements were subsequently made from recorded images and relative glottic areas were compared between groups. Our data quantify the normal physiologic response of the larynx to exercise and demonstrate a substantial laryngeal contribution to asthma induced by exercise.\r"

These included 12 malignant tumors, 23 benign tumors, 6 inflammatory masses, and 12 congenital lesions. The MRI performance ranged predominantly from good to excellent in detection of the lesion and the extent of involvement and in contrast to the surrounding tissue; when CT comparison was available, MRI proved to be equal to or better than it in detection of these factors and in preoperative diagnosis. Our results suggest that MRI should be the method of choice for the initial evaluation of the pediatric head and neck region, especially in those patients requiring multiple examinations. However, CT and MRI should be used conjunctively in complicated cases, especially those possibly involving lesions with calcifications or bony involvement.\r"

There was a highly significant increase in sway with head extension under two conditions; in both, the support surface moves proportionally to body sway angle (sway-referenced feedback). The largest increase in sway occurred when the eyes were closed and the support surface was sway-referenced. This latter condition removes vision, reduces the effectiveness of ankle proprioception, and forces the subject to depend mostly on vestibular information for equilibrium. We suggest that head extension increases sway because the utricular otoliths are put into a disadvantageous position. This may be another example of the role of utricular input in the control of balance.\r"

Local failure occurred in 8 of 111 (7.2%) patients in whom hemilaryngectomy was performed for tumors confined to one mobile true vocal cord. There was a diverse group of lesions within each T stage that responded differently to the surgical approaches.

Intravenous administration of aldosterone (1 mg/kg) induced no change in the ESP for 60 minutes after the injection. However, canrenoate, an aldosterone antagonist, produced a dose-dependent decrease in the ESP. Pretreatment with aldosterone attenuated the decrease in the ESP by canrenoate. The results suggest the possibility that aldosterone may play a role in the endolymph absorption of the endolymphatic sac.\r"

  ".W": "Duodenogastric reflux is a naturally occurring sporadic event, the incidence, occurrence, and detrimental effects of which have been difficult to assess. The reliability of 24-hour gastric pH monitoring to detect duodenogastric reflux was studied. Central to the use of pH monitoring for this purpose is confidence in its ability to measure and display pH data in a way that reflects changes in the gastric pH environment with sufficient sensitivity. To test this the gastric pH of 10 dogs was measured in the fasting state, after feeding, and after pentagastrin stimulation. The antrum was more alkaline in the fasting state (p less than 0.01) and the display of data by frequency distribution graph was sensitive enough to reflect induced pH changes. To test the consistency of gastric pH at a given position, simultaneous 24-hour gastric monitoring was performed in 12 normal subjects with two probes placed at either 5 or 10 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter. Only at the 5-cm position did the two probes read within 1 pH unit of each other more than 90% of the time. Based on these principles, gastric pH monitoring was performed 5 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter in 30 normal subjects and 11 patients, fulfilling Ritchie's clinical criteria for pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The data obtained was arranged into 71 variables and subjected to discriminant analysis. Sixteen variables were identified, each with a corresponding coefficient to be used as a multiplier to derive a score. A score of more than +2.2 indicated a high probability of pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The test was applied to a validation population consisting of 10 additional normal subjects and 10 patients meeting Ritchie's criteria. All normal subjects had a normal score and all but one (90%) of the patients had an abnormal score. When compared to O-diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA) scintigraphy in another group of 22 normal subjects and 60 patients, 24-hour gastric pH monitoring was superior in the detection of pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The study shows how the application of computer technology can be used to diagnose pathologic duodenogastric reflux in patients with complex foregut complaints.\r"

Our aims were to describe the clinical presentation, course, and management of patients afflicted with both cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis and to estimate the prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted of 30 patients with both primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma managed at our institution during an 8-year period. Development of cholangiocarcinoma was heralded by rapid clinical deterioration with jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. Cholangiocarcinoma complicating primary sclerosing cholangitis often was detected at an advanced tumor stage, which precluded effective therapy, and overall median survival was 5 months. Earlier recognition and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in such patients will be necessary to increase survival rates. Seventy patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were followed prospectively in a clinical trial of medical therapy for an average of 30 months. Twelve patients died and five were found at autopsy to have cholangiocarcinoma. The potential for cholangiocarcinoma to develop in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis may indicate that liver transplantation should be considered earlier in the course of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly emerged as an alternative to open cholecystectomy. However its safety, efficacy, and morbidity have yet to be fully evaluated. During the first 6 months of 1990, we performed 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 8% (8 of 100 patients; 4 major, 4 minor). There were 81 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 46.1 years (range, 17 to 84 years). All patients had a preoperative history consistent with symptomatic biliary tract disease, and most had proved gallstones by sonography. This included four patients with acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time improved significantly from month 1 to month 6 (122 +/- 45.4 minutes versus 78.5 +/- 30 minutes, respectively), indicating a rapid learning curve. Mean hospital stay was 27.6 hours, reflecting a policy of overnight stay. Postoperative narcotic requirements were limited to oral or no medications in more than 70% of patients. A regular diet was tolerated by 83% of the patients by the morning following the procedure. Median time of return to full activity was 12.8 +/- 6.8 days after operation. In addition analysis of the hospital costs of these 100 cases demonstrates a modest cost advantage over standard open cholecystectomy (n = 58) (mean, $3620.25 +/- $1005.00 versus $4251.76 +/- $988.00). There was one minor bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion, two postoperative bile collections, and one clinical diagnosis of a retained stone that passed spontaneously. Four patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of technical difficulties with the dissection. Although there is a significant learning curve, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by surgeons who are trained in biliary surgery and knowledgeable in biliary anatomy, and, as with all operations, it should be performed with meticulous attention to technique.\r"

In multivariate analysis by stepwise logistic regression, the only variable significantly (p = 0.03) associated with overall rate of complications was long-term corticosteroid therapy. Serious complications were more common in cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (p = 0.01) and preoperative steroid medication (p = 0.03). The combination of both of these risk factors increased the rate of reoperations from 0.6% (no steroids, no abscess) to 16% (steroids and abscess). No significant association with postoperative complications could be found for age, sex, duration of disease, previous operations, nutritional status, emergency surgery, extent of disease, type, number, and localization of anastomoses, presence of proximal ileo-/colostomy, or histologically inflamed margins of resection.\r"

Immediately after rectal amputation and extended lymphadenectomy, IOPHC was performed using physiologic saline containing 40 micrograms/mL of MMC at 45.5 +/- 0.6 C for 90 minutes, with an apparatus devised for IOPHC. At the end of IOPHC, the esophageal temperature was 37.2 +/- 0.8 C and cooling was not required. Antitumor efficacy and complications in the IOPHC group were compared with findings in 12 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery only within the same period of time. Operation time was not prolonged with IOPHC treatment. In cytologic examinations of the pelvic lavage just before IOPHC treatment, viable cancer cells were detected in 6 of the 14 patients but were never detected in the postoperative exudate drained from the pelvic cavity. Of the 12 patients in the control group, 2 had a local recurrence, while in the IOPHC group there was no local recurrence for 16.9 +/- 9.7 months at this writing. Postoperative complications did not differ between the groups. This IOPHC treatment is a favorable method in eradicating cancer cells for postoperative local recurrence of rectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Although liver transplantation is now accepted as the ideal therapy for end-stage liver disease, relatively few centers have gained a large experience in children, and good results have been elusive. Technical difficulty and a high incidence of graft failure are among the obstacles to success. At the University of California at Los Angeles, 39% of our liver transplants are in the patients who are younger than 18 years. We have analyzed our experience with 103 patients to emphasize factors important to a favorable outcome with the procedure. One hundred twenty-three transplants were performed in 103 children (mean age, 5.2 years; 48% younger than 3 years). No reduced-size grafts were used. Scrupulous attention to technical details of the vascular reconstruction, including frequent use of the supraceliac aorta of the recipient and interrupted suture techniques, ensured construction of sound hepatic artery and portal vein anastomoses at the first operation. Preoperative exchange transfusions were used if the prothrombin time was prolonged beyond 7 seconds, resulting in an average blood loss of only 3.3 volumes. Cyclosporine dosage was maintained in the high therapeutic range for the first 4 weeks, and anti-T-cell antibody (OKT3) was used for rejection (38%). Amphotericin prophylaxis was used for biliary atresia patients with multiple previous operations. Eighty-two of one hundred three patients (80%) are alive. There were no intraoperative deaths. Actuarial survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years are 80%, 79%, and 77%, respectively. Survival of patients who underwent transplantation at age less than 1 year is 65% versus 85% at age more than 1 year (p = 0.08). Retransplantation was performed in 19 patients (18%), with a survival rate of 58%. Hepatic artery thrombosis, the most frequent technical complication, occurred in only 16 patients (13%). Survival rates of ABO identical-match versus nonidentical-match grafts were 96% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.02). Graft survival was only 47% if more than one steroid cycle was needed, compared to 75% survival with OKT3 treatment. Despite impairment of renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 80 cc/kg/min) in 54% of patients and hypertension requiring therapy in 27%, 90% of the children demonstrated enhancement of growth, development, and functional status. The following conclusions were made. (1) Pediatric liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for all types of end-stage liver disease and should be considered early. (2) Factors that enhance survival include technical precision, aggressive retransplantation, antifungal chemoprophylaxis and therapy, and judicious immunosuppression with use of OKT3 for rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

At re-exploration, 15 patients (10.3%) were found to have locally recurrent parathyroid tumors (11 patients with adenoma and 4 with carcinoma). These 15 patients had 28 previous operations at outside institutions for HPT. Patients with locally recurrent HPT secondary to adenoma had a longer disease-free interval than patients with locally recurrent carcinoma. At the time of evaluation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for recurrent or persistent HPT, each patient was symptomatic and patients with carcinoma had significantly more symptoms and higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone than patients with adenoma. Locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm was correctly localized by preoperative testing in 14 of 15 patients. These 15 patients underwent 18 reoperations at NIH for excision of locally recurrent parathyroid tumors. Following the final reoperation (two patients had more than one procedure), each patient had normal serum levels of calcium. In addition each patient remains biochemically cured (based on normal serum calcium level), with a median follow-up interval of 21 months. Local recurrence of parathyroid adenoma comprises a small but significant proportion of cases of recurrent or persistent HPT and can be indistinguishable from parathyroid carcinoma. Findings suggestive of carcinoma include shorter disease-free interval, higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone, and histologic appearance. Whether the locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm is benign or malignant, aggressive surgery can control serum levels of calcium in these patients with acceptable rates of morbidity.\r"

The mean concentration of PICP in would fluid on day 1 was 207 +/- 92 (SD) micrograms/L, and on day 2 908 +/- 469 micrograms/L (p less than 0.001, signed rank test). On day 7, the mean concentration reached was 380 times higher than that of day 1 (79,330 +/- 54,151 micrograms/L). Only one peak of PICP antigenicity, corresponding to the intact propeptide as set free during synthesis of type I procollagen, was detected on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration analysis of wound fluid samples. The mean concentration of PIIINP was 70 +/- 61 micrograms/L on day 1, 86 +/- 88 micrograms/L on day 2, and 180 +/- 129 micrograms/L on day 3 (p less than 0.001 when compared with day 1). Finally on day 7, a 250-fold concentration (17,812 +/- 9839 micrograms/L), compared with day 1, was reached.

  ".W": "To better understand the role of granulocyte elastase (GE) in mediating tissue injury during sepsis, GE levels were measured in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in patients with septic shock (n = 16) and hemorrhagic shock (n = 30). Granulocyte elastase levels were compared to levels of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). Results show that although plasma GE-alpha 1-PI complex was initially elevated in patients with hemorrhagic and septic shock, elevations in plasma GE-alpha 1-PI complex (831 +/- 241 micrograms/L) persisted in septic shock patients. alpha 1-Protease inhibitor levels in serum were increased, resulting in an inhibition of serum GE activity. Granulocyte elastase activity in BALF, however, was significantly higher in those patients with septic, as compared to hemorrhagic shock (31.4 +/- 25.8 versus 3.7 +/- 4.0 U/L, respectively). In addition GE levels were compared to other parameters, including respiratory index, blood neutrophil count, and plasma levels of endotoxin, fibronectin, and coagulation factor XIII. Significant correlations were observed between GE-alpha 1-PI and increased endotoxin concentration and decreased fibronectin and coagulation factor XIII levels. Significant correlation was found also between GE activity in BALF and respiratory index. These findings suggest that severe tissue damage occurred in patients with septic shock complicated by multiple-organ failure. Although GE activity appeared to be adequately inhibited by alpha 1-PI in blood, increased GE activity in local tissues, such as lung alveoli, may be responsible for significant local tissue injury during septic shock.\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of dogs were subjected to a 15-minute period of regional myocardial ischemia by snaring the left anterior descending coronary artery proximal to its first diagonal branch. After release of the snare, the dogs were given either placebo (group 1: n = 7) or triiodothyronine (T3) therapy (group 2: n = 6). The dose of T3 given was 0.2 microgram/kg at 30-minute intervals to a total of six doses. Plasma free T3 level fell significantly during the ischemic period in both groups and continued to fall after reperfusion in group 1. In both groups, cardiac function deteriorated significantly during the period of ischemia and rapidly returned to control level after reperfusion. After 90 minutes of reperfusion, however, deterioration of left ventricular function was observed in group 1 and was significantly worse than in group 2, in which hemodynamic function was maintained and, in fact, improved to levels superior to control. It is suggested that T3 therapy may be worthy of trial in patients in whom reperfusion of the myocardium takes place after a relatively short ischemic period (the \"stunned myocardium\").\r"

  ".W": "From August 1984 through November 1988, 10 of 2,658 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting had ascending aortic disease that was not amenable to proximal anastomoses for coronary bypass grafting. This was due to a calcified aorta in 6 and acute aortic dissection in 4. There were 5 male and 5 female patients with a mean age of 71 years. Cannulation site was the femoral artery in 5, ascending aorta in 3, and aortic arch in 2. Profound hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation, with no cross-clamp or cardioplegia, was used in 9 patients, and circulatory arrest in 1. In 8 patients a single internal mammary artery was used as the total inflow with a saphenous vein graft brought off the internal mammary artery to one or more distal left-sided coronary vessels. Bilateral internal mammary arteries were used in 2 other patients. Operative mortality was zero. There was one perioperative myocardial infarction and one transient stroke without sequelae. All patients have done well from 1 to 6 years postoperatively. These data support the use of internal mammary arteries as single or bilateral proximal conduits for other venoarterial bypass grafts when the aorta is extensively diseased either by calcification or dissection.\r"

  ".W": "The alterations in tissue metabolism induced by hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass are not completely known. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine the effect of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass on energy states and intracellular pH of the heart and brain. Sheep were instrumented for cardiopulmonary bypass and had a radiofrequency coil placed over either the heart or skull. The animals were placed in a 4.7-T magnet at 37 degrees C and spectra obtained. The animals were cooled on cardiopulmonary bypass to either 26 degrees C (n = 17) or 18 degrees C (n = 14) for brain studies and to 26 degrees C (n = 12) for heart studies. Hypothermia increased the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio in the heart (2.38 +/- 0.23 versus 3.18 +/- 0.37, 37 degrees versus 26 degrees C, respectively, p = 0.03). The brain phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratio increased from 1.70 +/- 0.09 at 37 degrees C to 2.00 +/- 0.12 at 26 degrees C (p = 0.009) and 2.10 +/- 0.07 at 18 degrees C (p = 0.0001). Intracellular pH increased during hypothermia (heart: 7.05 +/- 0.02 to 7.18 +/- 0.02, 37 degrees versus 26 degrees C, p = 0.0001; and brain: 7.07 +/- 0.02 versus 7.32 +/- 0.02, 37 degrees versus 18 degrees C, p = 0.0001). The adenosine triphosphate resonance position is known to be sensitive to magnesium binding as well as temperature and was shifted upfield (p less than 0.01) in both the heart and brain. This effect could be totally explained by the temperature dependence of this process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred sixty of the patients with thymoma had myasthenia gravis and 15 had other autoimmune diseases; 55% of the thymomas were encapsulated and 45% invasive. Operation was radical resection in 87.5% of the patients, subtotal resection with residual tumor in 8.7%, and simple biopsy in 3.7%. A tumor relapse was observed in 24 patients (10%): 2 (1.5%) of 133 with encapsulated thymomas and 22 (20.4%) of 108 with invasive thymomas; among these patients, a relapse was found in 20.6% of the patients who received radiotherapy postoperatively and in 24.6% who did not. Adverse prognostic factors were clinical stage IVa (multiple pleural nodes), not feasible resection (for technical reasons), inoperable tumor relapse, and association with one of the following autoimmune diseases: pure red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and lupus erythematosus. Conversely, myasthenia gravis is now a curable disease; it contributes to early discovery of associated thymoma, thus allowing a better survival for patients with thymoma who have myasthenia gravis compared with patients with thymoma but without myasthenia gravis (p less than 0.05). Postoperative radiotherapy does not seem necessary after removal of encapsulated thymomas, but it is advisable in case of invasive thymomas, regardless of the extent of the resection.\r"

  ".W": "Cerebral septic emboli complicate the cases in 20% to 40% of patients with left-sided endocarditis but the management of these patients who require a valvar operation remains unclear. From 1980 to 1988, the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients, 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36, 80%), hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5, 11%), normal studies (n = 2, 4%), and unknown (n = 2, 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6, 6%), cerebral abscesses (n = 2, 2%), and seizure (n = 1, 1%). The presence of a hemorrhagic infarct preoperatively predisposed to a perioperative stroke (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, cerebral septic infarctions, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are common among patients with endocarditis referred for valvar operation. In the absence of a hemorrhagic infarct, valve replacement can be performed with minimal risk of a perioperative stroke.\r"

The improved method devised by us uses the special histological features and enables safe and reliable anastomosis. By this method, the tracheal perichondrium is retained and the strength of the anastomosed portion of the trachea is maintained, the failure of sutures due to tension on the anastomotic site being prevented. Also, reanastomosis can be performed after the cure of primary disease.\r"

  ".W": "From 1976 until April 1989, 31 intrathoracic total fundoplications were performed for reflux esophagitis and irreducible hiatus hernia. In the first 16 patients (group 1) the operation was complicated with acute perforation of the wrap in 4 cases, bronchogastric fistula in 1, and herniation of the wrap higher in the chest in 1. Technical modifications were applied to 15 more recent patients (group 2). These are enlargement of the hiatus, looseness of the wrap and its appropriate anchorage, avoidance of forceps when handling the stomach, care with the vagi, and efficient gastric decompression in the postoperative period. The postoperative course was always uneventful in group 2. Twenty-six patients, who still have their initial wrap, were considered for clinical evaluation: 11 from group 1 (mean follow-up, 81.5 months) and 15 from group 2 (mean follow-up, 32.8 months). All are free from any symptom of reflux; gas-bloat syndrome is infrequent and dysphagia is relieved. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring, performed in 14 patients (3 from group 1 and 11 from group 2) (mean follow-up, 42 months), was normal in 13; a pathological upright reflux (time pH less than 4, 8.4%) was demonstrated in one symptom-free woman in whom endoscopy was unremarkable. Mechanisms of complications experienced in group 1 are analyzed in the light of the technical evolution of the procedure, and the place of the intrathoracic total fundoplication in the management of short esophagus is defined, considering the other available surgical techniques.\r"

Fifty-five cases of empyema thoracis were postpneumonic, 8 followed esophageal rupture, and 5 were associated with thoracic trauma. Some form of systemic illness was a major contributing factor in the presentation of 29 patients. A single causal organism was found in 53 patients (the most common being Staphylococcus aureus), multiple organisms in 36, and no growth in 13. During the years 1983 to 1989 there was an increased incidence of empyemas caused by multiple or antibiotic-resistant organisms. Operative drainage was required in 90 patients and 12 were managed by thoracentesis or intercostal tube drainage alone. The in-hospital mortality rate for patients managed nonoperatively was 58% (7 of 12 patients); it was 16% (14 of 90 patients) for those receiving operative drainage. There were seven late deaths, four empyema related and three nonrelated. Early adequate operative drainage is recommended for patients with empyema thoracis.\r"

Nine patients (aged 19 to 66 years; 7 male, 2 female) required mechanical circulatory support after transplantation because of primary idiopathic organ failure (n = 2), implant difficulty (2), poor organ quality (2), or acute right heart failure (3). Devices used included the intraaortic balloon pump (6), centrifugal right ventricular assist device (2), left ventricular assist (1), biventricular assists (2), and total artificial heart (1). Two patients required multiple devices. One patient underwent retransplantation. Implant time ranged from 1 to 18 days. One early death occurred owing to right heart failure 6 days after transplantation, 7 hours after removal of a right ventricular assist device, for an overall mortality of 11%. The remaining 8 patients are alive 4 months to 28 months after transplantation. The actuarial 1-year survival of 89% +/- 10% compares well with the survival of 87% +/- 4% for the entire transplant group. All surviving patients are in functional class I. Echocardiographic examination in all patients revealed left ventricular ejection fraction to be normal in 7 and depressed in 1. Extending the criteria for organ donors or difficulty with the implant procedure can lead to early organ failure, which may be reversible with circulatory assistance allowing excellent survival.\r"

The second primary tumor was treated by surgical resection in 9 patients, 3 patients' tumors were considered unresectable, and the remaining 7 patients, despite having potentially resectable tumors, did not undergo resection because of insufficient pulmonary reserve or unwillingness to undergo resection. Actuarial life-table analysis of survival for the 9 patients who underwent resection showed a median survival time of 110.3 months compared with 19 months for the group with unresected but resectable tumors and 10.5 months for the group with unresectable tumors. There was no operative mortality in the group with resected tumors. We conclude that in patients in whom a second primary carcinoma of the lung develops, surgical resection prolongs survival and can be performed with a low operative mortality.\r"

However, the hemodynamic changes that occur during rejection after cardiac transplantation in patients treated with cyclosporine have not been clearly described. Between July 1986 and October 1989, 89 adults underwent orthotopic heart transplantation at the University of Michigan Medical Center. All patients received triple-drug therapy immunosuppression consisting of steroids, cyclosporine, and azathioprine. Cardiac hemodynamics were measured and correlated with the histologic assessment of rejection. There have been ten deaths among these 89 patients for an overall survival of 89%. There were no deaths from rejection. One hundred fifty-three of the biopsy specimens were read as grade 0, 31 were grade 1, 75 were grade 2, 103 were grade 3, and 9 patients had grade 4 biopsy specimens. No hemodynamic differences were noted in patients with increasing grade of rejection. Five patients (5/9, 55%) with severe rejection (grade 4) had symptoms of congestive heart failure at the time of biopsy. These symptomatic grade 4 patients differed from asymptomatic grade 4 patients only in cardiac output (2.9 versus 5.2 L/min). Overall hemodynamic decompensation was not evident as rejection grade increased. Routine serial endomyocardial biopsies remain the procedure of choice in the diagnosis of rejection in the asymptomatic patient after cardiac transplantation as hemodynamics do not predict degree of rejection.\r"

The adjacent noninvolved wires had minimal reaction. In the last 7 patients, serial sections of the fibrous tissue revealed entrapment of one or more sensory nerve fibers. In 6 of the 7 electrical potentials were measured and found to be elevated, indicating wire damage during twisting. Ferroxyl tests confirmed the collection of iron ions at this anodic point as a result of corrosion. Removal of the involved wires and the fibrous tissue surrounding this anodic point relieved the symptoms of pain and tenderness resulting from entrapped sensory nerves.\r"

Each group consisted of 5 animals. A 29-mm Medtronic mitral valve was secured in the mitral position with ten pledgeted sutures. The aorta was cannulated and normal saline solution was infused into the left ventricle until valvar disruption occurred. The peak pressure and the location and mechanism of disruption were then noted. At the peak left ventricular pressure required for valvar disruption, no individual sutures were broken. Instead, in all specimens a subannular myocardial rupture occurred in the posterior portion of the mitral annulus along the extent of the atrioventricular groove. In addition, the posterior wall of the left atrium dissected upward subsequently. Significantly greater pressures were required in the group with subannular suture placement as compared with the supraannular group (354 +/- 37 versus 236 +/- 33 mm Hg; p less than 0.0007). These data suggest that placement of horizontal mattress sutures with pledgets in the subannular position is superior to the currently recommended method of supraannular suture placement in mechanical valves.\r"

Prerepair preparatory procedures were designed to (1) encourage native pulmonary artery growth by increasing blood flow and (2) unifocalize pulmonary blood supply by transplanting or ligating major collaterals. A total of 121 staging procedures were performed with an overall mortality of 10.3%. One hundred thirty-four major collaterals were either ligated or transplanted. Thirty patients eventually underwent hemodynamic repair with an early mortality of 3.3% and late mortality of 10.0%. Twenty-six current survivors of repair remain clinically well after a mean follow-up of 3.6 years. Ten patients are currently in various stages of preparation. Twelve patients (20.7%) failed to achieve minimum requirements for repair after staging and await further palliation or heart-lung transplantation. The principles of management have evolved over the years and are discussed.\r"

This study examines the effect of atelectasis on the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes harvested from the bronchoalveolar space of atelectatic lung segments by bronchoalveolar lavage. Specifically, we studied natural killer and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes from the atelectatic lower lobes and contralateral normal lobes in a group of 8 dogs. We observed a decline of natural killer and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to 62.7% and 61.5%, respectively, of preatelectasis control values in the affected lung lobes (p less than 0.01). Simultaneous measurements of cytotoxic activity of bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes harvested from the unaffected contralateral normal lungs were comparable with control values. On the other hand, natural killer and lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity activities in peripheral blood lymphocytes were significantly increased in animals having right lower lobe atelectasis (166.7% and 154.7% of pretreated normal control, respectively, p less than 0.01). Atelectasis was also associated with an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the bronchoalveolar compartment. These findings confirm the presence of natural killer cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar compartment and demonstrate an atelectasis-induced impairment of local bronchoalveolar lymphocyte function. Such a dysfunction of local lung cellular host defenses may render the atelectatic lung susceptible to infection.\r"

Recently, amiodarone has been shown to be rapidly effective in suppressing sustained, incessant ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in this setting. This study evaluated the time course of arrhythmia suppression and comparative efficacy of amiodarone versus bretylium in a canine model of reperfusion arrhythmias. Of 23 dogs subjected to a Harris two-stage coronary artery ligation followed by release, 18 demonstrated clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias and received either intravenous amiodarone, 5 mg/kg (9 dogs), or intravenous bretylium, 5 mg/kg (9 dogs). Direct-current shocks for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were administered as necessary. Amiodarone rapidly suppressed sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation in this model with no dog in the amiodarone-treated group requiring cardioversion after completion of the 15-minute infusion versus 4 of 9 dogs in the bretylium-treated group (p less than 0.05). Amiodarone was more effective than bretylium in suppressing episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and premature ventricular complexes. The blood pressure and heart rate decreased more after amiodarone administration than after bretylium administration. We conclude that, in the canine reperfusion arrhythmia model, amiodarone is rapidly effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias and is more effective than bretylium.\r"

Histology showed an intimal thickening after 14 days and the media, which in the controls consisted of eight to ten layers of myocytes, was reduced to six to eight cell layers. During the first 2 weeks the graft segments had an impaired contraction when exposed to Krebs solution with 124 mmol/L K+, whereas after 1 month and later the graft segments approached the controls or had even higher contractile force. The thromboxane mimic U-46619 elicited full contractile force at all times whereas the potency was significantly lower during the first 14 days. Noradrenaline was unable to induce contraction in the graft segments during the first 14 days, but at 30 and 60 days it had regained full contractile force and was significantly more potent (approximately 60 times) in the graft segments compared with the controls. This study suggests that intimal thickening and hypercontractility might be a problem in free muscular arterial grafts.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether aspects of clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory studies improve the diagnostic accuracy of the chest roentgenogram in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), we followed up 302 consecutive patients with respiratory symptoms and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus. Of the 279 patients (92%) with follow-up information available, 31 (11%) were diagnosed with PCP. Only 68% of patients with PCP had typical chest roentgenograms. Regression analysis identified four independent predictors of PCP: diffuse or perihilar infiltrates, presence of mouth lesions, lactate dehydrogenase level more than 220 U/L, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 50 mm/h or more. Using these four predictors, patients could be stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for PCP. We suggest that examination of the mouth, chest roentgenogram, lactate dehydrogenase level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate be part of the evaluation of ambulatory patients with respiratory symptoms at risk for human immunodeficiency virus.\r"

  ".W": "Several previous studies that looked at the effects of labeling individuals as hypertensive found increases in psychosocial distress, diminished feelings of well-being, or absenteeism. Other studies found no such effects. Thus far, similar studies relating to labeling for high blood cholesterol levels have not been published. The Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project investigated whether labeling effects occurred as a result of the community-based screening, education, and referral programs it conducted in Worcester and Lowell. Nine questions concerning perceptions of physical and psychological well-being were asked on a questionnaire given to screening participants. The same questions were asked as part of a follow-up questionnaire given to all individuals identified as having high blood cholesterol levels at one of the screenings. Comparison of the baseline and follow-up results did not demonstrate significant overall negative effects among any age, sex, racial, income, or educational groups. On the contrary, responses to many of the questions revealed small but statistically significant improvements in perceptions of physical and psychological well-being. The absence of negative labeling effects may be attributable to the positive, supportive approach to participant counseling taken by the project.\r"

Centers in New York, NY, and Miami, Fla, have reported patients with renal disease complicating AIDS. These populations have included large proportions of black patients and intravenous drug abusers. Reports from San Francisco, Calif, have suggested the prevalence of renal disease complicating AIDS is low, but the population was composed primarily of white patients, with a low proportion of drug abusers. The George Washington University Medical Center was the site of treatment for 31.4% of the patients with AIDS in Washington, DC. This population was split roughly evenly between black and white patients. A retrospective survey of patients with both AIDS and renal disease revealed approximately two thirds of the patients were black, reflecting the demographics of the population with AIDS; 11% of patients had intravenous drug abuse as a risk factor for the development of AIDS; and 74% had acute renal failure. Of these patients, approximately equal proportions were black and white. Twenty-six percent of the population had chronic renal failure, but the overwhelming proportion were black. There were no differences between proportions of patients in age, sex, race, or risk factors in patients with acute renal failure and chronic renal failure, but there was a significant difference in the proportions of black and white patients with chronic renal failure. The reason for these differences is unknown, but differences in host responses to viral proteins, physiologic adaptations, or socioeconomic factors in these populations may play an important role in mediating the expression of renal disease in individual patients.\r"

We describe a recent increase in the number of observed cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in West Virginia. This is the fifth report of a recent increase in the incidence of ARF in the Ohio Valley area in the last 4 years. In contrast to the other reports, nearly two thirds of our cases of ARF were in adults, more than half of whom had suffered previous bouts of ARF. In these adults with recurrences, none was taking prophylactic penicillin at the time of presentation. Carditis was present in seven adults, two without a history of carditis. Arthritis was present in all adult patients. These data indicate a possible geographic phenomenon related to the increased number of observed cases of ARF and document that ARF is not simply a disease of childhood. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for extended penicillin prophylaxis for secondary prevention of ARF, especially for those with an increased risk of acquiring a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.\r"

Ninety-five patients between 60 and 90 years of age were evaluated by a psychiatric consultation service after a suicide attempt. Characteristics of this group included (1) a high degree of premeditation, (2) a tendency toward firearm use and wounds to the head, (3) male sex, (4) coexisting medical problems, (5) serious intent that increased by decade, (6) solitary living arrangements, (7) presence or history of a major psychiatric illness, and (8) ill health reported as a precipitant to suicidality. Major depression was the most common psychiatric diagnosis, with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the most frequently noted physical ailments. This elderly population of attempters resembled older persons who actually completed suicide and differed significantly from 1630 persons aged 16 to 59 years who attempted suicide. Heightened investigation of depressive features, treatment of alcohol abuse, early referral for psychiatric care, limited access to firearms, and strategies aimed at decreasing social isolation are recommended to decrease the likelihood of completed suicide in the elderly.\r"

Patients were prospectively followed up for an average of 4.6 years. Results showed that symptoms and signs resolved in 61% after a single injection. Recurrent episodes, after prolonged pain-free intervals, occurred in 27% and were effectively re-treated with injection. In 12% of cases, either injection failed or early recurrence required surgical release. Local adverse reactions to injection, including pain at the injection site, stiffness, ecchymosis, or atrophy of subcutaneous fat, were self-limited. No episodes of postinjection infection or tendon rupture occurred. The medical management of flexor tenosynovitis with local corticosteroid injection(s) is effective in nearly 90% of cases and is free from serious adverse reactions.\r"

One hundred one persons (3.9%) had a low serum TSH level. About half of them (51/101) were taking thyroid hormone. Of the remainder, 44 were not hyperthyroid did not become so during up to 4 years of follow-up. Forty-one of the 44 euthyroid persons had a serum thyroxine level of less than 129 nmol/L; repeated testing showed a serum TSH level of more than 0.1 mU/L in the three euthyroid persons with a serum thyroxine level of more than 129 nmol/L. Only six were hyperthyroid or became so during the follow-up period; all had a serum thyroxine level of more than 129 nmol/L. Routine clinical examination was not a sensitive indicator of hyperthyroidism and did not permit discrimination from euthyroidism. A low value of serum TSH alone, while it had high sensitivity and specificity for hyperthyroidism, had a low positive predictive value (12%) for this diagnosis; addition of the thyroxine assay raised the predictive value fivefold to 67%. A low value of serum TSH is far more common in older persons than is hyperthyroidism. Low values in euthyroid persons are accompanied by a clearly normal serum T4 concentration (less than 129 nmol/L) or by a serum TSH level of more than 0.1 mU/L on repeated testing. We recommend measurement of the serum TSH thyroid concentration, using a sensitive assay, as the initial step in testing any older person for possible hyperthyroidism. Measurement of the serum T4 concentration or the free T4 index on the same sample would be needed only in the approximately 2% with a serum TSH level of less than 0.1 mU/L; alternatively, the TSH assay in these could be repeated at a later time.\r"

Bronchogenic carcinoma was identified in 2.5% of the bronchoscopies. Additional neoplasms were found in another 2.5%. The presence of nonlocalizing abnormalities was not associated with an increase in either the rate of bronchogenic carcinoma or in the diagnostic yield (specific anatomic diagnosis or bleeding site identified) at bronchoscopy when compared with patients with normal chest roentgenograms. The factors of male sex, age more than 40 years, and a more than 40 pack-year smoking history appear useful in identifying patients in whom the yield of bronchoscopy is likely to be high.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or lovastatin at a dosage of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. Lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (P less than .001) changes as follows (for dosages of 20 to 80 mg/d): decreased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (24% to 40%), increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level (6.6% to 9.5%), decreased total cholesterol level (17% to 29%), and decreased triglyceride level (10% to 19%). The National Cholesterol Education Program's low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level goal of less than 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was achieved by 80% to 96% of patients, while the less than 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) goal was achieved by 38% to 83% of patients. The difference between lovastatin and placebo in the incidence of clinical adverse experiences requiring discontinuation was small, ranging from 1.2% at 20 mg twice daily to 1.9% at 80 mg/d. Successive transaminase level elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal were observed in 0.1% of patients receiving placebo and 20 mg/d of lovastatin, increasing to 0.9% in those receiving 40 mg/d and 1.5% in those receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin (P less than .001 for trend). Myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms with a creatine kinase elevation greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was found in only one patient (0.1%) receiving 40 mg once daily and four patients (0.2%) receiving 80 mg/d of lovastatin. Thus, lovastatin, when added after an adequate trial of a prudent diet, is a highly effective and generally well-tolerated treatment for patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.\r"

  ".W": "Screening mammography is underutilized, even for women older than 50 years for whom there is a general consensus that regular annual screening is appropriate and necessary. To evaluate reasons for this underutilization, we studied a random sample of 517 women in Los Angeles, Calif who were older than 50 years. All women were found to be underscreened, especially women older than 65 years. For example, approximately 35% of women 50 to 64 years old and 47% of women aged 65 years and older never had had even one mammogram. Analyses revealed that the most important factor that predicted whether a women ever had had a mammogram was whether her physician had talked to her about mammography. Women were between four and 12 times more likely, depending on their age group, to have had a mammogram at some time if their physicians discussed it with them. The discussions did not need to be lengthy or complex. These results indicate that physicians need to know that discussing screening mammography with their patients has a major impact on breast cancer screening behaviors.\r"

A significantly smaller percent of study subjects with invasive disease than in situ disease had at least one Pap test in the 3 years prior to diagnosis (age- and race-adjusted odds ratio: 3.38). The two groups did not differ in visits to a physician for other reasons during this period. Pap testing decreased with increasing age for both groups, but not physician visits. While 65% percent of the subjects with invasive disease aged between 65 and 79 years had never had a Pap test until diagnosis, 88% had seen a physician in the preceding 3 years. Women with regional or distant invasive disease were least likely to have had Pap tests, and, within this group, those aged between 35 and 64 years were also least likely to have seen a physician. Strategies for early detection must reflect missed opportunities and the need to bring those not receiving care into the system.\r"

However, the variation of the estimated risks among the studies was far greater than could plausibly be explained by chance alone. To explain this variation, we looked at the effects of type, duration, and dosage of treatment. Overall, women who took 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens had a risk of breast cancer that was 1.08 times that of women who did not receive this therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.2). The relative risks from these individual studies of low-dosage therapy did not differ significantly from each other. Women who took 1.25 mg/d or more of conjugated estrogens had a breast cancer relative risk of 2.0 or less in all studies. However, the variation in observed risks at this higher dosage was significant. This implies that other risk factors varied among these studies, making it difficult to estimate the overall risk associated with this dosage. The relative risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy among women with a history of benign breast disease was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.5). The combined results from multiple studies provide strong evidence that menopausal therapy consisting of 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens does not increase breast cancer risk.\r"

Women with a history of estrogen use had 20% lower age-adjusted, all-cause mortality than lifetime nonusers (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.87). Mortality decreased with increasing duration of use and was lower among current users than among women who used estrogens only in the distant past. Current users with more than 15 years of estrogen use had a 40% reduction in their overall mortality. Among oral estrogen users, relative risks of death could not be distinguished by specific dosages of the oral estrogen taken for the longest time. Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a reduced mortality from all categories of acute and chronic arteriosclerotic disease and cerebrovascular disease. This group of women had a reduced mortality from cancer, although this reduction was not statistically significant. The mortality from all remaining causes combined was the same in estrogen users and lifetime nonusers.\r"

Within the comparison sample, higher levels of medical morbidity were associated with higher levels of hypochondriacal symptoms. This occurred primarily because the most serious medical disorders were associated with more bodily preoccupation, disease conviction, and somatization. Within the hypochondriacal sample, no correlation was found between the degree of hypochondriasis and the extent of medical morbidity.\r"

Although their preoperative coagulation values were similar, cases used significantly more whole blood (cases, 9.5 +/- 5.2 units; control subjects, 3.0 +/- 2.0 units; median +/- interquartile range), packed red blood cells (cases, 2.1 +/- 4.0 units; control subjects, 0.9 +/- 2.0 units), and platelets (cases, 12.2 +/- 12.0 units; control subjects, 2.9 +/- 4.0 units) than control subjects. Cases had intensive care unit stays of 4.7 +/- 5.7 days (mean +/- SD) vs 2.1 +/- 1.9 days for control subjects and postoperative hospitalizations of 10.9 +/- 8.2 days vs 7.0 +/- 3.2 days for control subjects. We conclude that aspirin exposure within 7 days before coronary bypass surgery is associated with an increased rate of reoperation for bleeding and that reoperation is associated with large increases in transfusion requirements and intensive care unit and hospital stays.\r"

All women were studied first in 1983 to 1984, when they were premenopausal and aged 42 to 50 years, and then restudied in 1987. Women gained an average of 2.25 +/- 4.19 kg during this 3-year period; 20% of women gained 4.5 kg or more, and only 3% lost 4.5 kg or more. There were no significant differences in weight gain of women who remained premenopausal and those who had a natural menopause (+2.07 kg vs +1.35 kg). Weight gain was significantly associated with increases in blood pressure and levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting insulin. Weight gain is thus a common occurrence for women at the time of menopause and is related to the changes in coronary heart disease risk factors observed during this period. Efforts to lose weight or to prevent weight gain may help to mitigate the worsening in coronary heart disease risk factors in middle-aged women.\r"

The biopsies were also used for measurements of enzymatic activities and for histochemical and histopathologic analyses. Pretraining strength values were less than half those of healthy controls, mean fiber areas were twice those of healthy controls, and oxidative enzyme activity was low. After training, a significant increase in isometric (mean 29%) and isokinetic (mean 24%) strength was observed and maintained for some time.

Twenty-six men were studied at admission, and 11 were retested after completion of the program. After obtaining resting measurements of HR and systolic and diastolic blood pressures, each patient performed the GXT using an arm ergometer. Patients maintained a cranking rate of 50rpm, which was monitored electronically. The workloads started with a warm-up period of 0 watts (stage 1) and increased by increments of 5 watts. Each stage lasted three minutes-2.5 minutes of exercise and 30 seconds of rest. The RPE was taken five seconds before the end of each exercise stage. During the rest period, HR and blood pressures were recorded. Scatter plots and linear regression analyses revealed no statistically significant relationship, either at early stages of GXT or at peak work, between HR and RPE. The results suggest that RPE cannot be used reliably as a surrogate for direct pulse measurement in exercise training of persons with acute dysvascular amputations.\r"

The hypothesis that spontaneous EMG activity changes with time was assessed. During the chronic phase evaluation, a conduction study was performed to rule out peripheral nerve damage, and the amount of reflex activity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = areflexia; 5 = greater than 5 beats of clonus) to estimate the amount of spasticity. Subjects demonstrated normal conduction through the sensory (sural nerve) and/or motor segments of the peroneal and tibial nerves. In the acute phase, each muscle had spontaneous activity with no significant variation between different muscles of the same patient. In the chronic phase, there was a positive correlation between the degree of spontaneous activity in a muscle and the length of its axon (p less than .01) and a negative correlation between the amount of spontaneous activity and the degree of reflex activity (p less than .01). Specifically, the lower motor neuron in the chronic phase of an SCI seems to behave much like an axonopathy where the degree of spontaneous EMG activity is dependent on the length of the axon, with the additional concept that spontaneous activity is inhibited by spasticity.\r"

A prospective study of 18 patients with mild closed head injury was undertaken to determine the usefulness of MEP screening within two weeks of the acute event. Long latency event-related potentials (P300s), in response to auditory stimuli with an oddball paradigm, were included in the screening. The subjects had several symptoms consistent with the postconcussive syndrome at the time of the evoked potential testing. Only one patient had an abnormal evoked potential response (greater than three standard deviations from the mean) from all the testing done.
