  ".W": "Two hundred consecutive patients with femoral neck fractures (FNF) and 200 controls matched by age, sex, nursing home residency and number of admissions within the last 2 years, were interviewed about recent drug use. The matching criteria were chosen to achieve case and control groups that were comparable with regard to overall physical disability. Thus a preliminary study had shown FNF to be strongly associated with nursing home residency and to be correlated with the number of recent hospital admissions. FNF was found to be negatively associated with use of coronary drugs (OR = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.11-0.70) and positively associated with drug use in general (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04-3.05). The OR for the various classes of psychotropic drugs was consistently greater than 1., although this was not statistically significant. An inherent problem in interpreting such findings is that underlying disease may predispose the subject to both FNF and drug use, thus creating a non-causal relationship.\r"

Twenty-one patients were treated with oral zidovudine (600 mg daily) and IFN-alpha was increased to 18 MU daily for another 4 weeks. Only one of the 20 evaluable patients achieved a partial response at 8 weeks, that lasted for 3 months. Despite IFN-alpha dose escalation in six patients, no further responses were seen. While myelotoxicity was mild, fatigue was the dose-limiting side-effect that prevented dose escalation in seven eligible patients. The combined treatment did not result in a decrease in HIV-Ag. In summary, our results indicate that the addition of IFN-alpha to zidovudine in patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma is not an efficacious treatment.\r"

Several reports have recently shown that the underlying defect in FHBL involves different mutations in the apo B gene which lead to reduced levels of apo B mRNA or to the production of truncated forms of apo B having either a lower synthetic rate or a higher catabolic rate than normal apo B. We here present a three-generation family with several FHBL members in which the linkage analysis shows absence of co-segregation between apo B gene alleles and the hypocholesterolaemic phenotype. We conclude that a dominantly transmitted mutation in a gene other than that for apo B is responsible for the low plasma cholesterol levels.\r"

The inflammatory group showed a higher mean S-EPO level (mean value +/- SEM, 69 +/- 11 mU ml-1) than the neoplastic (43 +/- 5 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05) and infectious groups (27 +/- 4 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). The S-EPO level in the inflammatory group also differed from that of 32 healthy controls (36 +/- 3 mU ml-1; P less than 0.05). Fourteen patients with added iron deficiency (12 subjects from the inflammatory group) showed the highest S-EPO concentration (72 +/- 17 mU ml-1). Conversely, S-EPO levels were lower in febrile subjects (12 patients with infection and five with malignancy) than in non-febrile patients (28 +/- 4 mU ml-1 vs. 55 +/- 7 mU ml-1; P less than 0.01). In the infectious group, the logarithm of S-EPO correlated directly with the haemoglobin and haematocrit values. We conclude that differences in S-EPO concentration in ACD may be further related to the patient's iron stores and temperature. A decrease in EPO production may contribute to the pathogenesis of ACD secondary to infection.\r"

The study was conducted on 48 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. 44 of whom completed the trial. After an initial oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to exclude the presence of gastric mucosal lesions, patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either etodolac 200 mg b.i.d. or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d. for a period of 4 weeks. Endoscopic control followed this treatment period. Both drugs proved effective in relieving clinical symptoms, without a statistically significant difference. Gastric mucosal lesions were observed in 15% of etodolac-treated patients and in 46% of patients treated with naproxen (P less than 0.05) (95% CI 0.01-0.60). Painful dyspepsia was observed in 15% of patients treated with etodolac vs. 38% of patients on naproxen therapy. This study demonstrates that etodolac is at least as active as naproxen in relieving rheumatic symptoms, and its administration results in a significantly lower degree of gastric damage.\r"

A total of 1555 individuals (836 men and 719 women) were smokers. 1048 individuals (604 men and 444 women) were ex-smokers and 1497 individuals (560 men and 937 women) were non-smokers. The serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration was significantly lower in smokers than in ex-smokers and non-smokers (P = 0.05 and P = 0.001, respectively). Smoking habits did not affect the serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. The prevalence of non-toxic goitre and toxic diffuse goitre was significantly higher in smoking women than in non-smoking women (P = 0.005 and P = 0.04, respectively). Thiocyanate may be the goitrogenic factor responsible for the increased prevalence of non-toxic goitre. The cause of the increased prevalence of toxic diffuse goitre is less obvious. Hypothetically, an increase in sympathetic activity in smokers may promote the development of thyrotoxicosis in predisposed individuals, but immunological disturbances caused by smoking are another possibility.\r"

IgG was administered subcutaneously, at 50 or 150 mg ml-1, 20 ml per infusion, by means of a pocket-portable electric infusion pump. Infusions were given 2 to 4 times weekly for 24 months, with a change of dose regimen after 12 months. The desired plasma IgG levels were reached after a mean lag phase of 3 months (range 1-5 months). The median (and ranges) of the individual mean plasma IgG levels during the ensuing 9-month periods were as follows: high-level period, 6.5 g l-1 (range 6.2-7.8 g l-1); low-level period, 3.2 g l-1 (range 3.0-4.0 g l-1). During the high-level period, compared to the low-level period, there was a significant decrease in the following parameters: 'days in bed at home', 'days missed work' and 'days with fever'. No serious side-effects were observed. It is concluded that a plasma IgG concentration of 6 g l-1 can readily be achieved by subcutaneous IgG substitution, and the prophylactic effect is superior to that obtained with a plasma IgG concentration of 3 g l-1.\r"

While plasma HDL and total cholesterol were similar in the present samples of the two communities, platelet aggregation to epinephrine was significantly higher in the Walloon subjects. When the two populations were divided into younger (28-54 years) and older (55-73 years) age groups, the older Walloon subjects exhibited platelet hyper-aggregability to most of the agonists, compared to the other three groups. In addition to dietary fats, alcohol and smoking habits, age was an important determinant of platelet phospholipid fatty acids and platelet reactivity. The present results reinforce those of previous studies, indicating that platelet behaviour is significantly affected by the main risk factors for CHD.\r"

The mean HbA1c level (+/- SEM) was reduced from 9.5 +/- 0.2% to 7.4 +/- 0.1% in the ICT group (P less than 0.001), and from 9.4 +/- 0.2% to 9.0 +/- 0.2% (P less than 0.01) in the RT group. The difference between the groups was significant (P less than 0.001). During a period of 3 years, 57% of the ICT patients (95% confidence interval 44-73%) and 23% of the RT patients (95% CI, 11-34%) (P less than 0.001) had at least one episode of serious hypoglycaemia, with the need for third-party assistance or resulting in coma. Eighteen of the 32 ICT patients who initially had adrenergic symptoms during hypoglycaemia changed to predominantly neuroglycopenic symptoms. This was the case with only 8 of 38 RT patients (P less than 0.01). The change in symptoms was related to the increased frequency of serious hypoglycaemia, but neither symptoms nor frequency of hypoglycaemia bor any relationship to insulin dose, body mass index, duration of diabetes or autonomic nerve function. The results of several neuropsychological tests did not differ between the groups at baseline, and did not change during the study. There were no signs of deteriorating cognitive function in the patients with serious hypoglycaemic episodes.\r"

Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can aggravate the hyperlipidaemia associated with this disorder, presumably by increasing triglyceride synthesis and reducing very low density lipoprotein catabolism by lipoprotein lipase. This report documents the gradual amelioration of dysbetalipoproteinaemia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus following therapy with exogenous insulin alone. Although the beneficial effects of insulin therapy in this patient may include inhibition of triglyceride synthesis and improved triglyceride catabolism, we propose that insulin may also stimulate clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoprotein particles.\r"

The data were collected at 16 hospitals in 9 cities across the U.S.A. from October 1976 through August 1978. The first paper on this research was published in 1981 and concluded that IUDs increase the risk of PID. The report cited an estimated RR (relative risk) of PID for current IUD users vs nonIUD users of 1.6 with a 95% confidence interval of (1.4, 1.9). However, careful examination of the report reveals that the data support conclusions antithetical to those at which the author arrived. When the second report on the WHS was published in 1983, it was anticipated that many of the shortcomings of the first report would be corrected, but they were not. In 1983 we undertook a complete reanalysis of the same WHS data using more appropriate criteria and the results were compared to the first two published reports. The reanalysis revealed an RR of 1.02 (0.86, 1.21) for current IUD users compared to noncontraceptors. The conclusion of the WHS should have been that IUDs do not increase the risk of PID.\r"

  ".W": "Meta-analysis, a set of statistical tools for combining and integrating the results of independent studies of a given scientific issue, can be useful when the stringent conditions under which such integration is valid are met. In this report we point out the difficulties in obtaining sound meta-analyses of either controlled clinical trials or epidemiological studies. We demonstrate that hastily or improperly designed meta-analyses can lead to results that may not be scientifically valid. We note that much care is typically taken when meta-analysis is applied to the results of clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, requires strict adherence to the principles we discuss in this paper before it allows a drug's sponsor to use a meta-analysis of separate clinical studies in support of a New Drug Application. Such care does not always carry over to epidemiological studies, as demonstrated by the 1986 report of the National Research Council concerning the purported association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the risk of lung cancer. On the basis of a meta-analysis of 13 studies, 10 of which were retrospective and the remaining 3 prospective in nature, the Council concluded that non-smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke are at greater risk of acquiring lung cancer than non-smokers not so exposed. In our opinion, this conclusion in unwarranted given the poor quality of the studies on which it is based.\r"

A segmented regression model is used in conjunction with the Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards model, as well as the parametric Weibull and exponential cure models. These models allow us to determine approximately when survival first began to improve dramatically, indicating that improved treatments had become available, and how long it took for survival to level off again indicating that the full population survival impact had been realized. In addition, the degree to which the parametric models fit allows us to determine if the survival improvements occur within a parametric family. Results of the modelling indicate that dissemination took approximately 11 years in Hodgkin's disease while only 3 years in disseminated testicular cancer. In both disease sites survival first broke with prior trends between the time that the breakthrough trial started and its publication, indicating that earlier moderately successful 'precursor' trials with combination chemotherapy may have initiated the improved population survival trends. Reasons for the difference in dissemination time in the two cancer sites are examined in order to understand what factors may be responsible for the speed of dissemination and effective utilization of new therapies.\r"

  ".W": "This study explored associations among job activities and disability due to cardiovascular disease by merging national disability data with independently-obtained job activity data. Disability data were taken from a 1978 U.S. health interview survey (n = 9855). Expert ratings of job activities (dimensions) were obtained from a job analysis database (n = 2485 occupations). The two databases were merged such that job dimension data were imputed to each occupation in the disability database. Odds ratios for cardiovascular disability were calculated for scores in the second, third, and fourth quartiles for each of the 32 job dimensions, using scores in the first quartile as the standard. Job dimensions associated with cardiovascular disability were (a) hazardous situations; (b) vigilant work and responsibility for others; (c) exchanging job-related information; and (d) attention to devices. Occupations identified with high scores on these job dimensions included transportation jobs (air traffic controllers, airline pilots and attendants, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), teachers (preschool, adult education), and craftsmen/foremen (machinists, carpenters, and foremen).\r"

  ".W": "This article studies risk factors for physical and social disability among U.S. adults ages 55+ who have arthritis, compared to non-arthritis persons of those ages. The dependent variables refer to difficulties in walking, physical functioning (motions and strength), personal care, and household care. The data set is the Supplement on Aging (SOA) (n = 16,148) that accompanied the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. The SOA data are cross-sectional; relationships of risk factors to disability suggest causation but do not directly demonstrate it. Logistic regressions show that risk factors are similar for arthritis and non-arthritis people, with one important exception. (1) The similarities are: For both groups, odds of disability rise with age, diminish with education, and are higher for non-whites and non-married persons. Disability rises with number of chronic diseases and impairments, and it is elevated for underweight persons (Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 20; further analysis indicates this reflects incomplete control of their severe illness status). Long duration of arthritis and recent medical care for it are associated with disability. (2) The exception is: Severe overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 30) is a disability risk factor for arthritis people, but not for non-arthritis people. Previous research has shown that obesity/overweight is a risk factor for etiology of osteoarthritis; our analysis now shows its continued importance for disability when the disease is present.\r"

  ".W": "Risk of cardiovascular events was determined over 24 years of surveillance in relation to general adiposity reflected by relative weight and by regional obesity estimated by skinfolds and waist girth per inch of height. Upper quintile values of relative weight, subscapular skinfolds and waist girth were each associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease in both sexes. Risk of total cardiovascular events increased with the degree of regional, central or abdominal obesity. Mortality from cardiovascular disease was also increased. Increased relative weight and central obesity were both associated with increased risk factors including cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose and uric acid. Changes in weight were mirrored by changes in risk factors with linear trends over a 15 lb range of weight fluctuations. Subscapular skinfold and the ratio of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold, measures of central obesity, were in either sex also associated with an increased probability of coronary attacks in particular. The subscapular skinfold contributed to CHD risk independent of body mass index (BMI). Multivariate analyses taking all the risk factors into account indicate an independent effect of abdominal obesity on stroke, cardiac failure and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in men. In women, only the subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio independently contributes to CHD, cardiovascular and all cause mortality. Regional obesity appears to be an independent contributor to cardiovascular disease at a given level of general adiposity, its effect only partially mediated through promotion of other known risk factors. These data suggest that cardiovascular disease is as closely linked to abdominal as to general adiposity.\r"

Consumption of (n-3) PUFA increased hepatic (n-3) PUFA levels without changing total PUFA (46.35 vs. 46.87 mol/100 mol), whereas macrophage PUFA levels were decreased. The synthesis of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes (SP-LT) (LTC4 and LTE4) was progressively reduced by increasing dietary (n-3) PUFA, i.e., there was a reduction of 76% in mice fed a diet containing a (n-3):(n-6) PUFA ratio of 1.93 compared with the control diet. The 5-series SP-LT (LTC5 and LTF5) were produced in all animals consuming (n-3) PUFA and accounted for 62% of all SP-LT synthesized in mice fed the diet containing a 1.93 (n-3):(n-6) PUFA ratio. Synthesis of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha decreased 81% in mice fed a diet containing a (n-3):(n-6) PUFA ratio of 1.93 whereas prostaglandin E2 synthesis decreased 44% in mice fed diets with (n-3):(n-6) ratios ranging from 0.41 to 1.93.\r"

Twelve healthy volunteers were given 30 mL/day of either oil for 3 wk. Intake of the vitamin E-rich fish oil resulted in a marked decrease in serum triglycerides (48%) and in fibrinogen (11%). After administration of the low vitamin E-containing oil there was a considerably smaller reduction of serum triglycerides and no significant reduction of fibrinogen. Both oils caused an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in the atherogenic index, but neither oil altered the total cholesterol level. Serum vitamin E was decreased by 9% and plasma malondialdehyde was increased by 122% after intake of the low vitamin E-containing oil, but both remained normal after intake of the other oil. The effect of vitamin E may be due to inhibition of fatty acid peroxidation with less formation of malondialdehyde and a larger amount of active (n-3) fatty acids in their sites of action in the liver, resulting in a greater decrease in the synthesis of triglycerides and fibrinogen.\r"

Plasma vitamin C concentrations were determined upon entry into the study, once each week during a 5-wk period of dietary restriction (10 mg/day) of the vitamin and twice each week during a 2.5-wk period of supplementation with 500 mg/d. The rate constant (K) and the half-life of the depletion phase (t1/2) were determined. Other values calculated included the mean plasma vitamin C concentration in the four subject groups at entry, depleted and supplemented states of vitamin C nutriture. A t test indicated that none of the calculated values differed due to age. In contrast, K was significantly smaller in men, resulting in a longer t1/2. The entry and depleted plasma vitamin C concentrations did not differ due to gender whereas repleted plasma vitamin C concentrations were higher in women than in men. Data analysis indicated that plasma depletion of vitamin C is a first-order process. In addition, t1/2 was inversely related to entry vitamin C levels at concentrations below approximately 85 mumol/L whereas above this concentration t1/2 was approximately constant and averaged 14.2 d. This implies that a conservation effect may be operative at low plasma vitamin C concentrations.\r"

Deuterium-labeled forms of free pyridoxine (PN) and PN-glucoside were compared using the urinary excretion of labeled forms of the vitamin B-6 metabolite 4-pyridoxic acid as the main index of absorption and metabolism. When comparing orally administered, isotopically labeled PN and PN-glucoside in separate groups of subjects, similar bioavailability was observed although within-group variability was high. A dual-label study designed to examine the bioavailability of these compounds when administered simultaneously indicated that the utilization of deuterated PN-glucoside was 58 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) relative to that of deuterated PN. PN-glucoside was detected in all urine samples, which provided additional evidence of incomplete metabolic utilization. In contrast, intravenously administered PN-glucoside underwent approximately half the metabolic utilization of oral PN-glucoside. These studies indicate that the bioavailability of dietary PN-glucoside, although incomplete, is substantially greater in humans than previously found in rats. In addition, the difference between oral and intravenous routes suggests a role of beta-glucosidase(s) of the intestinal mucosa, microflora, or both in the release of free PN from dietary PN-glucoside.\r"

The RDR percentage was calculated: [(A5-A0)/(A5)] x 100. The 5-h RDR was determined in 20 deficient and 16 reference diet rats and a clear relationship to liver retinyl palmitate concentration was demonstrated. At a liver retinyl palmitate concentration of less than 0.105 mumol/g, all RDR values were greater than 20%. When the liver retinyl palmitate was greater than 0.122 mumol/g the RDR was less than 20%. This study suggests that the intramuscular RDR is a valid tool for estimating liver retinyl palmitate in populations in which the oral RDR cannot be administered.\r"

Reduced Zn intake in two of the three experiments resulted in abortion or premature delivery. Zinc-supplemented animals with feed intake restricted to that of Zn-deficient animals also aborted or delivered prematurely. Zinc-supplemented animals fed for ad libitum access delivered living young at term. Fetal/neonatal liver Zn concentration was low in the guinea pigs compared to that reported for other animals and was affected to a lesser extent by low Zn intake by the dam. Zinc concentration of neonatal plasma was also less than that in several other species. Change in activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme with addition of Zn in vitro was greater in the plasma of Zn-deficient guinea pigs than in that of Zn-adequate guinea pigs and may be useful as an indicator of Zn status.\r"

Concentration of 64Cu in the placenta increased rapidly over the first 4 h, thereafter remaining constant. Transfer to the fetus was linear over 48 h with little evidence of storage in the liver. Maternal serum levels decreased initially, concurrently with increased 64Cu levels in the maternal liver, but did not subsequently increase. Immediately following injection, as much as 40% of the radioactivity was in the nonalbumin fraction, and approximately 37% of that fraction (18% of total) was greater than 30,000 molecular weight. After 24 h, up to 60% of the 64Cu was still found in the albumin peak. The data suggest that the fetus can obtain its Cu from maternal ceruloplasmin but does not exclude the possibility that transfer occurs from the exchangeable (albumin/amino acid) Cu pool of the maternal plasma. In a second experiment, mice at different stages of gestation were injected with 64Cu and killed 4 h later. Total Cu levels and 64Cu uptake into the maternal tissues or into the placenta did not change with increasing gestation. Both total Cu and 64Cu uptake in the fetus and fetal liver increased to a maximum on d 16. Levels in the liver decreased thereafter to term, whereas levels in the rest of the fetus remained approximately constant. The pattern was similar whether the results were expressed per organ or per gram of fresh weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Four diets were formulated to maintain equal intakes of protein, vitamins and minerals at different energy intakes. Somatotropin increased growth rate 30 to 35% across diets despite an 8 to 12% reduction in ad libitum feed intake. Lean growth rate (kg/d) was increased preferentially by ST in the faster-growing H x Y barrows, which showed a 2.8-fold greater maximum rate increase than the slower-growing Y x L barrows. In control barrows, 10% reductions in energy intake had no effect on lean gain and improved feed/lean gain about 10%. In somatotropin-treated barrows, lean gain was reduced with each energy restriction in H x Y; energy intake had no effect on lean gain in Y x L barrows. Feed/lean gain was improved 22% in Y x L barrows at the lowest energy intake. Data indicate that somatotropin accentuates breed differences in lean gain and energy requirements. Pigs with low lean-growth potential will benefit from restricted feeding, whereas strategies to increase energy intake in pigs with high lean-growth potential may be desirable.\r"

Cluster analysis was conducted at each of six levels of body dissections, and a final analysis was conducted with all 47 variables. Small intestine, pancreas, liver, and kidneys were consistently assigned to the FHP-cluster; stomach, cecum, and colon to clusters correlated, r greater than 0.5, to the FHP-cluster; carcass, thoracic and offal variables to unrelated clusters. In the final analysis with all 47 variables represented, only variables from the small intestine and jejunum were assigned to the FHP-cluster.

This study was undertaken to determine the earliest metabolic change(s) associated with DHEA treatment. Serum cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, insulin, glucagon, thyroid hormones and hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity were, in general, unaltered in obese Zucker rats after 7 d and 24, 12 and 3 h of DHEA treatment. Malic enzyme, long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A hydrolase and catalase activities and peroxisomal beta-oxidation rates were elevated after 7 d and 24 h in DHEA treatment, but not after 12 h. Mitochondrial beta-oxidation was not altered. Hepatic mitochondrial state 3 respiration per g liver with glutamate-malate was elevated after 7 d and 24, 12 and 3 h in DHEA-treated rats and was elevated per mg protein except after 7 d. Succinate-supported state 3 respiration per g liver was also elevated after 7 d and 24 and 12 h of DHEA treatment. Mitochondria from rats treated for 7 d had lower levels of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine and an increase in phosphatidylcholine. Changes in fatty acid composition of these phospholipids occurred after 7 d and 24 h of DHEA treatment. In an additional study, rats were treated with DHEA or DHEA plus ethidium bromide for 3 d. Ethidium bromide inhibited the increase in mitochondrial protein and respiration associated with DHEA treatment. These findings indicate that mitochondrial respiration is the earliest factor affected by DHEA and may be associated with protein synthesis.\r"

Peroxidation was monitored by measuring ethane production, an autoxidation product of (n-3) unsaturated fatty acids. Weanling rats were fed a selenium- and vitamin E-deficient basal diet or one supplemented with 0.2 mg Se/kg and/or 200 mg vitamin E/kg. After 11 to 13 wk of feeding, ethane production was tripled in LPS-treated Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats compared to saline-treated deficient rats. In both doubly deficient and adequate rats, LPS increased ethane production, but it did so to a greater extent in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats. Dietary Se or vitamin E supplementation alone significantly reduced ethane production from LPS-treated rats. Vitamin E was more protective than Se against LPS-induced lipid peroxidation. Escherichia coli and Salmonella minnesota LPS also increased ethane production in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats. These results show that low doses of LPS stimulate lipid peroxidation in vivo in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats.\r"

Peroxidation was monitored by measuring ethane production from tissue slices, as well as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and conjugated dienes in tissue homogenates. Weanling rats were fed a selenium- and vitamin E-deficient basal diet or one supplemented with 0.2 mg of Se/kg of diet and 200 mg of vitamin E/kg. After 9 to 16 wk, ethane production and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in liver and lung generally were increased by LPS treatment of Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats. Conjugated dienes were increased by LPS treatment in liver of Se- and vitamin E-deficient rats, but paradoxically, were higher in Se- and vitamin E-adequate liver tissue. Daily injections of 1 g of hydroxyurea/kg of body weight, a cell proliferation inhibitor, for 2 d prior to LPS injection significantly decreased the LPS-induced ethane production in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rat liver and lung. These results show that low doses of LPS injected into rats stimulated lipid peroxidation in vitro in Se- and vitamin E-deficient rat liver tissue. Hydroxyurea decreased LPS-induced lipid peroxidation in vitro; this suggests that neutrophils or macrophages are involved in LPS-induced lipid peroxidation.\r"

The object of the present investigation was to determine the minimum number of daily food records required to estimate intake of specific nutrients in children. Both members of 70 pairs of twins (n = 140 children) completed a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 23 food records throughout a 2-y period. All subjects were white and range in age from 5 to 14 y. Assuming an attenuation of the correlation coefficient of 80%, the minimum number of daily food records required to estimate energy intake was seven for boys and eight for girls. As a group, the vitamin intakes were the most variable for both boys and girls, often requiring more than 20 records for either sex. Requirements for other nutrients generally fell between these two extremes. The results of the present investigation are particularly relevant to the interpretation and design of studies of associations with nutrient intake.\r"

This study evaluated cortical bone thickness in the retromolar area of 49 human mandibles to determine if there is an advantage (in terms of cortical thickness) to placement of screws for rigid fixation at the external oblique ridge versus placement at the inferior border. The mandibles were sectioned vertically at three sites in the retromolar area, corresponding to the bone available for rigid fixation of the sagittal osteotomy. Cortical bone thickness was measured at the external oblique ridge and 5 mm above the inferior border. The buccal and lingual cortices were found to be significantly (P less than .001) thicker at the external oblique ridge than at the inferior border. This suggests that there may be an advantage in terms of stability to placement of internal fixation screws at the superior border.\r"

After a mean follow-up period of 15 months, 76% of the initial advancement was preserved, representing 24% osseous resorption. The enveloping soft tissues of the chin followed the bony movement in a ratio of 1:0.88. Horizontal osteotomy of the inferior border of the mandible was a relatively stable procedure when used for large chin advancements. The broadcast possible musculoperiosteal pedicle should remain attached to the advanced genial segment to minimize osseous resorption and to achieve more predictable soft-tissue changes.\r"

Cytologic diagnoses concurred with surgical histologic diagnoses 90% of the time. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was found to have a false-positive rate of 0.5% and a false-negative rate of 2.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of FNAB in determining a malignant diagnosis were 81.1% and 99%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated at 98.9% and 82.8%, respectively. Diagnostic rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value increased consistently throughout the study period, indicating that the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB improved with experience.\r"

Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation.\r"

Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation.\r"

Peele's views concerning \"conventional disease-based alcoholism treatment,\" controlled drinking, and \"the disease model\" are shown to be based largely on inadequate scholarship, misrepresentations of the literature, inappropriate comparisons, unwarranted generalizations, and straw-man arguments.\r"

The most frequent period of abstinence from the use of alcohol and other drugs was between one and two years. Forty-five of the subjects preferred opioids, 27 amphetamines, 24 cocaine, 18 marijuana, and 16 alcohol. The reasons for use were separated into three categories: emotional, physical, and social. Results showed that the amphetamine and cocaine addicts selected a higher number of physical reasons for use, and that the alcohol group chose social reasons most frequently. There were no differences between drug groups in total number of emotional reasons selected. Specific reasons for use were also analyzed between drug-of-choice groups. The findings cast doubt on earlier studies that suggested differential psychopathology or emotional disorders among addicts with different drugs of choice. Clinical implications of these data are discussed.\r"

During the same time period, estimated nondomestic production of marijuana available for consumption in the United States increased 58% and domestic production increased 119%, while there was no clear-cut trend in prices. Reports of marijuana use associated with emergency room visits more than doubled in these years. The reasons for these apparent discrepancies in the data regarding the supply and use of marijuana are unknown. The possible causes of change in these and other measures of illicit drug use are examined because they form the basis for assessment of the efficacy of the recently proposed 1989 National Drug Control Strategy.\r"

While Iranian and India peoples preserved their original worship in their final settlements, Indo-European tribes, including the Thracians, the Phrygians, and the Greeks, after settling in Europe and Asia Minor, abandoned their ancestral worship of Soma (Sabazios) and substituted the Semitic (alcoholic) Dionysos. However, they retained traces of the original Soma worship in Dionysiac rituals. This modified Dionysiac worship spread throughout the Western world. Six formal criteria are used to establish the identify of Soma with Dionysos (Sabazios): (1) both cults had the same aim (to cause ecstatic behavior); (2) both cults required the attainment of the same spiritual state (purity); (3) both cults had an idiosyncratic myth in common; (4) both cults showed the identical word root in the name of the worshipped god; (5) both cults had identical zoological and botanical associations with their god; and (6) the alcoholic god (Dionysos) was depicted as having the same physical effects on human beings as that of the ancient nonalcoholic god (Soma).\r"

However, Cohen (1988:35) has cautioned that \"this method requires some heroic assumptions, and is, therefore, fraught with difficulty.\" Slight variations in the definition of AIDS, in the progression rate, and in reported seropositivity rates used as data in the spreadsheet can make enormous differences in the results obtained through back-calculation. Despite the limitations of the method, an estimate of the possible size of the IDU population can be derived from back-calculation, with careful consideration of ethnographic realities taken into account. In San Francisco, the present authors believe that there were approximately 13,000 heterosexual IDUs as of the end of 1989. Further demographic divisions by ethnicity, age, sex, and even neighborhood could be made using the same techniques, if AIDS cases and seropositivity levels could be obtained for each variable. Table II predicts a cumulative 705 AIDS diagnoses among San Francisco heterosexual IDUs by the end of 1993, or nearly six times as many as reported through 1988. This prediction is based on an assumption of 2.5% seroconversion per year (1989-1993) and on modest progression-rate increments of 5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, and 3% in the eleventh through fifteenth years after HIV infection. Thus, it shows the magnitude of the epidemic that San Francisco will shortly face and emphasizes the need to act vigorously to prevent further HIV contagion among IDUs as well as from them to their heterosexual partners (drug using or not).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Unfortunately, several potential errors found in uncontrolled trials may suggest benefit from screening where none exists. Only a large, randomized, controlled clinical study demonstrating decreased mortality from prostate cancer can prove that screening is beneficial. Until such a study is performed, patients should be informed of both the potential benefits and the risks of screening and treatment.\r"

Four of the eight patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas had abnormalities of chromosome 12 consistent with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor. These abnormalities comprised an i(12p) in two patients and a del(12q) in a third patient detected by cytogenetic analysis and multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis in a fourth patient. Three of these four patients with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor established by genetic analysis achieved a complete response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The tumor biopsy of one patient showed a t(11;22) (q24;q12), and this patient had chemotherapy directed to neuroepithelioma. Cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful for the tumors of three patients; these tumors did not have multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis. These patients did not respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One patient with a diagnosis of extragonadal seminoma failed to respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and had a second tumor biopsy performed that demonstrated a t(8;14) (q24;q32). This patient's diagnosis was changed to a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, genetic analysis provided a diagnosis in six of nine patients. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses are useful clinical tools for the determination of histogenesis in some patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas of uncertain histology.\r"

Treatment with rHuTNF led to fragmentation of DNA into nucleosomal oligomers and to induction of the expression of TRPM-2, a programmed cell death-associated gene. Both events preceded cell death by several hours. Treatment with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors accelerated both the rHuTNF-mediated DNA fragmentation and the elevation in TRPM-2 messenger RNA levels. These results suggest that rHuTNF exerts its cytotoxicity on L929 cells by activating programmed cell death, leading to apoptosis, and that topoisomerase II inhibitors enhance rHuTNF-mediated cytotoxicity by accelerating this process.\r"

  ".W": "Congenitally immune-deficient bg/nu/xid (BNX) mice are severely compromised in their ability to mount T-cell, B-cell, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell responses. Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification.\r"

We assessed NSAID use in relation to risk of human large-bowel cancer in a hospital-based, case-control study of 1326 patients with colorectal cancer and 4891 control patients. For regular NSAID use that continued into the year before interview, the multivariate relative risk estimate was 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.8); the estimate decreased as the duration of use increased, but the trend was not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained whether cancer or non-cancer controls were used, and the inverse association was apparent for both colon cancer and rectal cancer in men and women and in subjects younger and older than 60 years. Regular NSAID use that had been discontinued at least 1 year previously and non-regular use were not associated with risk. Almost all regular NSAID use was of aspirin-containing drugs. The present data suggest that the sustained use of NSAIDs reduces the incidence of human large-bowel cancer.\r"

Among 301 case subjects with incidence adenomatous polyps (174 men and 127 women) and 506 control subjects (223 men and 283 women), an increased risk was observed with increasing body mass index in women (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.0; for highest versus lowest quartile, linear trend P = .02).

This study evaluates the variability in the PRO preprocedure criteria for the three procedures most frequently reviewed by PROs: carotid endarterectomy, cataract removal, and cardiac pacemaker implants. In August 1989, the PRO review criteria were received from the Health Care Financing Administration. To provide a reference point for reviewing the PRO criteria, national practice guidelines for these three procedures were identified. Wide variability was demonstrated in the PRO procedure-specific carotid endarterectomy and cataract removal review criteria among PROs, and the criteria differed significantly from the identified practice guidelines. The criteria for cardiac pacemaker implants were somewhat less variable, and were based, to varying degrees, on practice guidelines developed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Greater attention is needed to improve the development of review criteria, including the use of relevant practice guidelines, to ensure that review criteria are optimal.\r"

They received neurobehavioral assessments at 1 and 12 months postinjury while receiving their assigned drug and at 24 months while receiving no drugs. In the severely injured, phenytoin significantly impaired performance at 1 month. No significant differences were found as a function of phenytoin in the moderately injured patients at 1 month or in either severity group at 1 year. Patients who stopped receiving phenytoin according to protocol between 1 and 2 years improved more than corresponding placebo cases on several measures. We conclude that phenytoin has negative cognitive effects. This, combined with lack of evidence for its effectiveness in preventing posttraumatic seizures beyond the first week, raises questions regarding its use for long-term prophylaxis. Our findings do not negate phenytoin's proven efficacy in controlling established seizures nor do they indicate that its cognitive effects are worse than other anticonvulsant drugs.\r"

Physical restraints were observed in use on 18.1% of dementia unit patients and on 51.6% of comparison unit patients who were out of bed during the day (adjusted odds ratio, 0.283;95% confidence interval, 0.129 to 0.619). Pharmacologic restraints were routinely given to 45.3% of dementia unit patients and 43.4% of comparison unit patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.950; 95% confidence interval, 0.611 to 1.477). We used multivariate logistic regression to identify residence in a nonspecialized nursing home unit, nonambulatory status, transfer dependency, mental status impairment, hip fracture history, and a high nursing staff-to-patient ratio, which we found to be independent predictors of physical restraint use. Physically abusive behavior, severe mental status impairment, and frequent family visitation were found to be significant predictors of pharmacologic restraint use, while advanced patient age, large nursing home size, and patient nonambulatory status were protective against such use. These results support the conclusion that physical and pharmacologic restraint constitute separate treatment modalities with different risk factors for use, and indicate that specialized dementia units are successful in reducing the use of physical but not pharmacologic restraints.\r"

The increases among men in this period ranged from 4% to 10% per year, and thus exceeded those of any other type of cancer. In contrast, there were relatively stable trends for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and slight declines for adenocarcinoma of more distal portions of the stomach. Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and gastric cardia disproportionately affected white men and rarely occurred among women. By the mid-1980s, among white men, adenocarcinomas accounted for about one third of all esophageal cancers, while cardia cancers accounted for about one half of all stomach cancers with specified subsites. The rising incidence rates and similar demographic patterns point to the need for investigation into the causes of these poorly understood cancers.\r"

We propose that patients who develop end-stage liver disease through no fault of their own should have higher priority for receiving a liver transplant than those whose end-stage liver disease results from failure to obtain treatment for alcoholism. We base our proposal on considerations of fairness and on whether public support for liver transplantation can be maintained if, as a result of a first-come, first-served approach, patients with alcohol-related end-stage liver disease receive more than half the available donor livers. We conclude that since not all can live, priorities must be established for the use of scarce health care resources.\r"

First, alcoholics are morally blameworthy, their condition the result of their own misconduct; such blameworthiness disqualifies alcoholics in unavoidable competition for organs with others who are equally sick but blameless. Second, because of their habits, alcoholics will not exhibit satisfactory rates of survival after transplantation; good stewardship of a scarce lifesaving resource therefore requires that alcoholics not be considered for liver transplantation. These arguments are carefully analyzed and shown to be defective. There is not good moral or medical reason for categorically precluding alcoholics as candidates for liver transplantation. It would, in addition, be unjust to implement such a preclusion simply because others might respond negatively if we do not.\r"

The 33 patients receiving high-dose epinephrine and 35 patients receiving standard-dose epinephrine were similar in demographics and variables known to affect outcome. There was no difference in potential complications between groups except serum calcium, which was 1.97 mmol/L (SD, 0.20) in the high-dose epinephrine group and 2.10 (SD, 0.20) in the standard-dose group. Hospital discharge rates (18% in the high-dose vs 30% in the standard-dose group) and neurological status on discharge were not significantly different. High-dose epinephrine did not produce increased direct complications in this cardiac arrest population compared with standard-dose epinephrine.\r"

  ".W": "Using a daily questionnaire, we prospectively studied 277 physicians from two hospital medical services for incidents of exposure to blood and body fluids and barrier use before and after the implementation of universal precautions. We found that implementation significantly increased the frequency of barrier use during exposure incidents from 54% before implementation to 73% after implementation of universal precautions. Implementation led to a decrease in the number of exposure incidents that resulted in direct contact with blood and body fluids (actual exposures), from 5.07 to 2.66 exposures per physician per patient care month, and to an increase in averted exposures in which direct contact was prevented by the use of barrier devices, from 3.41 exposures per patient care month before implementation to 5.90 exposures per patient care month after implementation. Implementation affected neither the types of body fluid or procedures involved nor the overall rate of exposure incidents (8.5 per patient care month) but, through an increase in barrier use, it did prevent direct contact with blood and body fluids and thus converted what would have been an actual exposure into an averted one. We conclude that universal precautions were effective in reducing the risk of occupational exposures among physicians on a medical service.\r"

Using age 25 years to divide the population, HIV-1 prevalence among young women (5.2%) was significantly higher than among young men (2.3%), but similar to that in both older women (5.3%) and older men (5.6%). Overall, HIV-1 rates for nonwhites (4.8%) were higher than those for whites (2.5%). Although categories were identified across correctional systems, which may serve to focus prevention programs, variability in rates among correctional systems indicates that program planning must take local conditions into consideration.\r"

  ".W": "Women with anorexia nervosa have reduced bone mass and may develop fractures. Neither the pathophysiology of this osteoporosis nor its natural history is known. To study the clinical course of osteoporosis, we followed up 27 women with anorexia nervosa for a median of 25 months (range, 9 to 53 months). At study entry, cortical bone density, measured by single-photon absorptiometry of the radial shaft, was low (mean +/- SD, 0.63 +/- 0.07 g/cm2) and inversely related to the duration of amenorrhea (r = -0.49). During follow-up, most patients gained weight (n = 19), took calcium supplements (n = 16), and exercised regularly (n = 22), but fewer than half reached 80% or more of ideal body weight (n = 11), resumed menses (n = 6), or received estrogen (n = 4). Cortical bone density was stable during follow-up for the group as a whole; the mean annual change (+/- SD) was +0.005 (+/- .015) g/cm2 (95% confidence interval, -0.0009 to +0.0109). There was no significant difference in the mean change in bone density between women who attained 80% of ideal weight and those who did not or between groups who did or did not regain menses, take estrogen or calcium, or exercise vigorously. Four fractures were clinically observed in three women during follow-up. The rate of 0.05 nonspine fractures per person-year (95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.13) exceeds that of normal women in this age range (relative risk, 7.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 18.5). We conclude that reductions in cortical bone density appear not to be rapidly reversed by recovery from anorexia nervosa and that anorectic women may have an increased risk of fracture.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of standard and high doses of epinephrine on coronary perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 32 patients whose cardiac arrest was refractory to advanced cardiac life support. Simultaneous aortic and right atrial pressures were measured and plasma epinephrine levels were sampled. Patients remaining in cardiac arrest after multiple 1-mg doses of epinephrine received a high dose of 0.2 mg/kg. The increase in the coronary perfusion pressures was 3.7 +/- 5.0 mm Hg following a standard dose, not a statistically significant change. The increase after a high dose was 11.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; this was both statistically different than before administration and larger than after a standard dose. High-dose epinephrine was more likely to raise the coronary perfusion pressure above the previously demonstrated critical value of 15 mm Hg. The highest arterial plasma epinephrine level after a standard dose was 152 +/- 162 ng/mL, and after a high dose, 393 +/- 289 ng/mL. Because coronary perfusion pressure is a good predictor of outcome in cardiac arrest, the increase after high-dose epinephrine may improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation.\r"

In our second patient, the smoking of crystal methamphetamine likely produced diffuse vasospasm that resulted in acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and death. The recognition of potentially lethal cardiac complications associated with the smoking of crystal methamphetamine is of extreme significance and should be emphasized to potential abusers of this drug.\r"

The introduction of real-time ultrasonography and Doppler units for the measurement of blood flow in the 1970s, recent advances in transducer design, signal processing, and miniaturization of electronics, along with the lack of radiation exposure, have been primarily responsible for the increased use of ultrasound. However, although ultrasonography can provide diagnostic information safely and easily, interpretation of the information requires an understanding of the physics behind ultrasound, how that physics is translated into ultrasound instrumentation, recognition of artifacts that are associated with the various types of ultrasonography, and identification of these artifacts in specific anatomic locations.\r"

The introduction of DNA hybridization methodology has provided a valuable tool for reevaluation of the epidemiology of Escherichia coli infection as well as an alternative to the conventional phenotypic approach for studying the genotypic basis for virulence.\r"

The defense mechanisms at one site may have opposing effects on microbial growth at other sites in the urinary tract. The outcome following entrance of microorganisms into the urinary tract is a result of competing forces, which consist of these local urinary defense mechanisms, the initial numbers of microorganisms contaminating the urinary tract, and microbial virulence factors.\r"

Boys are more commonly infected during the first 3 months of life. After the first year, symptomatic UTI is much more frequent among girls. Similarly, asymptomatic bacteriuria is more frequently detected in boys than in girls during the first 12 months of life. Thereafter, the incidence decreases markedly in boys but increases in girls. Recent investigations indicate that lack of circumcision is a risk factor for UTI among male infants. Recurrent UTI is common and frequently asymptomatic. The most important microbiologic factor that is associated with E. coli causing acute pyelonephritis is adherence mediated by P fimbriae. Other factors, such as capsule, lipopolysaccharide, aerobactin production, and serum resistance, also determine the invasiveness of E. coli. Vesicoureteral reflux appears to be an important host factor predisposing to UTI. Microbiologic and host factors that are determinants of renal scarring are under investigation.\r"

  ".W": "The laboratory is essential in the diagnosis and management of UTIs. The presence of pyuria and bacteriuria, the two most important indicators of UTIs, are most accurately determined by standard techniques. In quantitating pyuria, the finding of greater than or equal to 10 leukocytes/mm3 of urine by either hemocytometry or direct microscopy correlates highly with symptomatic, culture-proven UTIs. The determination of bacteriuria by direct microscopy is inaccurate, particularly at lower levels of bacteriuria; thus, quantitative urine cultures remain the most accurate measure of bacteriuria. Significant bacteriuria, previously defined as greater than or equal to 10(5) CFU/ml of urine, has been redefined with the observation that as few as 10(2) CFU/ml can be associated with significant pyuria and symptoms suggestive of cystitis. The need for routine and posttreatment urine cultures in nonpregnant women with acute dysuria remains controversial, but current data suggest that they are usually unnecessary. Rapid diagnostic tests for detection of pyuria and bacteriuria are designed to increase efficiency and decrease cost in the diagnosis of UTI. Unfortunately, none of these techniques can quantitate pyuria or bacteriuria as accurately as the standard methods, but the level of accuracy offered by the standard methods is not always necessary in the care of patients with uncomplicated UTIs. These tests are particularly well suited for screening asymptomatic high-risk populations. Noninvasive localization techniques continue to be explored as possible alternatives to invasive localization procedures, but they remain largely research tools that are not readily available to the practicing clinician. Understanding the applicability and appropriate use of newer technologies in the evaluation of patients with UTIs and how these technologies complement the standard diagnostic techniques will lead to better, more efficient, and less costly patient care.\r"

Diagnosis is dependent on the demonstration of significant bacteriuria in a properly collected and handled urine sample. The approach to treatment depends on the degree of illness at presentation, the presence of structural urinary tract abnormalities, and the age of the patient. Pathophysiology of urinary tract infection is dependent on interactive factors of the host and of the invading microorganism. Urinary tract abnormalities have significant impact on the management of children with urinary tract infections, both medically and surgically. Of particular importance is the observation that renal damage usually occurs within the first 5 years of life, and treatment delay in some young patients may have significant consequences. The overall prognosis in children with urinary tract infection is favorable.\r"

  ".W": "Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention, and it accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis is a superficial infection of the bladder mucosa, whereas pyelonephritis involves tissue invasion of the upper urinary tract. Localization tests suggest that as many as one third of episodes of acute cystitis are associated with silent upper tract involvement. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials. Because of the superficial nature of cystitis, single-dose and 3-day regimens have gained wide acceptance as the preferred methods of treatment. Review of the published data suggests that a 3-day regimen is more effective than a single-dose regimen for all antimicrobials tested. Regimens with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appear to be more effective than those with beta-lactams, regardless of the duration. Acute pyelonephritis does not necessarily imply a complicated infection. Upper tract infection with highly virulent uropathogens in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. The optimal treatment duration for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis has not been established, and 14-day regimens are often used. We prefer to use antimicrobials that attain high renal tissue levels, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or quinolones, for pyelonephritis. Women with frequently recurring infections can be successfully managed by continuous prophylaxis, either daily or thrice-weekly, by postcoital prophylaxis, or, in compliant patients, by early self-administration of single-dose or 3-day therapy as soon as typical symptoms are noted. Our drug of choice for all these regimens is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult men is very uncommon, but it is occasionally noted in homosexual men who practice insertive and intercourse or in heterosexual men whose partners have vaginal colonization with E. coli.\r"

  ".W": "The urinary tract undergoes profound physiologic and anatomic changes during pregnancy that facilitate the development of symptomatic UTIs in women with bacteriuria. Although the adverse effects of asymptomatic bacteriuria on maternal and fetal health continue to be debated, it is clear that asymptomatic bacteriuria is the major risk factor for developing symptomatic UTI and that symptomatic infections are associated with significant maternal and fetal risks. Because the majority of symptomatic UTIs develop in women with bacteriuria earlier in pregnancy, treatment of bacteriuria is undertaken to prevent symptomatic infections. All women should be screened at the first antenatal visit, which is reliably and inexpensively done with a dipstick culture. Short-course therapy is as effective as prolonged therapy and should be followed with a repeat culture to document clearing of the bacteriuria. Failure to eliminate bacteriuria with repeated therapy or recurrence with the same organism is indicative of renal parenchymal infection or a structural abnormality. All women with persistent bacteriuria or recurrent infection should have follow-up cultures and a complete urologic evaluation after delivery.\r"

Women with frequently recurrent symptomatic UTI may benefit from estrogen therapy. Fourteen days of therapy is indicated in patients with upper UTI.

The incidence of UTI in immunosuppressed patients other than diabetics or renal transplant recipients is not higher than the incidence in nonimmunosuppressed individuals. The higher frequencies of infection seen in diabetics and in renal transplant recipients correlate best with the duration of bladder instrumentation rather than with glycosuria or immunosuppressive regimen. Neutropenia blunts the clinical manifestations of UTI and predisposes to bacteremia. Use of broad spectrum antibiotics results in alterations in indigenous flora, promotes urinary infections with resistant nosocomial pathogens, and predisposes to fungemia with hematogenous seeding of the urinary tract. Routine screening for detection of asymptomatic bacteriuria and prompt institution of antimicrobial therapy is indicated only in renal transplant recipients within 3 months of their surgery and not in any of the other diseases discussed.\r"

About 90% of men with prostatitis have nonbacterial prostatitis or prostatodynia. Nonbacterial prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate of unknown cause. Patients with prostatodynia typically have sterile cultures and normal prostatic secretions but demonstrate an acquired voiding dysfunction on videourodynamic testing. Because nonbacterial types of prostatitis have no recognized infectious cause, treatment using antimicrobial agents is ineffective and unwarranted.\r"

Most modifications have not improved upon the closed catheter itself. However, even with meticulous care, this system will not prevent bacteriuria forever. After bacteriuria develops, our ability to limit its complications is minimal. Additionally, the catheterized urinary tract becomes a reservoir of bacteria that can be transferred to other patients. Once a catheter is put in place, one must keep two important concepts in mind: (1) keep the catheter system closed in order to postpone the onset of bacteriuria; and (2) remove the catheter as soon as possible. If the catheter can be removed before bacteriuria develops, postponement becomes prevention. However, the best prevention is not to use a urethral catheter at all. Non-device alternatives to urethral catheterization should be used whenever possible. If these are not useful or successful, then other devices might be considered. For incontinent men, a condom catheter is a useful alternative. For patients with urinary retention, intermittent or suprapubic catheterization may be options for both short-term and long-term needs. The roles of these alternatives to urethral catheters must be defined by controlled trials.\r"

The present study used all subjects who responded fully to activity and health questions in 1976 and who were reported as either dead or alive (not lost to follow-up) in 1984. A total of 348 subjects (185 ATH, 163 N-ATH) were assessed and caloric expenditure groups were established by kilocalories (kcal) of aerobic exercise per week; 0 kcal (group 1), 1-399 kcal (group 2), 400-899 kcal (group 3), 900-1499 kcal (group 4), 1500-2499 kcal (group 5), and 2500+ kcal (group 6). Only activity considered to be aerobic was used in the establishment of the aerobic categories. Death rate was highest in groups 1 and 2. Subjects in group 1 tended to be the oldest. Year of birth (age) (P less than 0.001) and CVD (P less than 0.05) as reported in 1976 were significantly related to mortality between 1976 and 1984. College athletic status and 1976 exercise level were not significantly related to mortality. Prevalence of CVD and HBP was highest in groups 1 and 6, suggesting a moderate amount of aerobic activity as optimal.\r"

Resting blood volumes were also estimated (carbon monoxide rebreathing) so that absolute PV (ml) and TP and ALB contents (g) could be determined. COP increases (P less than 0.001) during exercise were similar at all gestational ages. Plasma volume, TP, and ALB decreased during exercise with significantly (P less than 0.001) greater losses occurring from 29-32 wk gestation. This may indicate an increase in capillary permeability to large molecules when vascular volume was highest.\r"

Other features of the renal failure were an 84-fold increase in urine beta 2-microglobulin excretion (from 0.19 to 16.0 micrograms.min-1) and a much smaller increase in urine total protein excretion (from 0.07 to 0.18 mg.min-1) during the post-race period. Post-race creatinine clearance remained below pre-race levels throughout the study, varying between 42.8 and 72.9 ml.min-1, in contrast to the post-race 49% increase in the remaining runners (from 138.1 +/- 12.9 to 205.5 +/- 59.9 ml.min-1). Osmolal clearance also remained low (0.31 to 0.98 ml.min-1) compared with the pre-race values (1.46 +/- 0.02 ml.min-1), as did the urine flow rates (0.11 to 0.18 ml.min-1) compared with the pre-race values (0.34 +/- 0.02 ml.min-1). This renal dysfunction persisted despite the patient receiving 2 l of intravenous fluids immediately after the race and probably resulted from fluid restriction during the race. There was full recovery of renal function 1 yr later when the subject again ran the Comrades Marathon.\r"

Clear patterns emerged showing frequent, rapid, and large weight loss and regain cycles. Of the college wrestlers, 41% reported weight fluctuations of 5.0-9.1 kg each week of the season. For the high school wrestlers, 23% lost 2.7-4.5 kg weekly. In the college cohort, 35% lost 0.5-4.5 kg over 100 times in their life, and 22% had lost 5.0-9.1 kg between 21 and 50 times in their life. Of the high school wrestlers, 42% had already lost 5.0-9.1 kg 1-5 times in their life. A variety of aggressive methods wer used to lose weight including dehydration, food restriction, fasting, and, for a few, vomiting, laxatives, and diuretics. \"Making weight\" was associated with fatigue, anger, and anxiety. Thirty to forty percent of the wrestlers, at both the high school and college level, reported being preoccupied with food and eating out of control after a match. The tradition of \"making weight\" still appears to be integral to wrestling. The potential physiological, psychological, and health consequences of these practices merit further attention.\r"

This study examined the effect of three running speeds on two groups of runners, one with chronic low back pain. The two groups of seven male marathon runners ran at 70%, 85%, and 100% of their marathon race pace for 30 min on separate occasions. Before and after exercise the subjects were seated for 20 min with the lumbar spine supported. Stature was measured before pre-exercise sitting, before running, after 15 min of running, after 30 min of running, and after post-exercise sitting. A stadiometer accurate to within 0.5 mm was used to record changes in stature. Results showed no differences in response to the three running regimens between the groups (P greater than 0.05). Shrinkage was greater during the first 15 min, being 3.26 (+/- 2.78) mm compared with 2.12 (+/- 1.61) mm for the second 15 min of the run (P less than 0.05). The faster the running speed the greater the resultant shrinkage. The 70%, 85%, and 100% conditions caused 3.37 (+/- 2.38), 5.10 (+/- 1.90), and 7.69 (+/- 3.69) mm of shrinkage, respectively (P less than 0.005). These results suggest that low back pain is independent of the shrinkage induced by running. Further research is required to determine the effect of longer duration runs on spinal shrinkage.\r"

However, HR for 100% (arm-only exercise) tended to be higher than 0% at level 1 (delta HR = 10 beats.min-1; P less than 0.10), level 2 (delta HR = 12 beats.min-1, P less than 0.06) and level 3 (delta HR = 10 beats.min-1; P less than 0.06). At level 1, stroke volume (SV) remained essentially unchanged from 0-75%, while SV at 100% (108 ml) was slightly though not significantly lower (P less than 0.10) than 0% (125 ml). At exercise levels 2 and 3, SV remained unchanged for 0 and 25%; however, SV at 50, 75, and 100% were generally lower (P less than 0.05) compared with 0%. These results indicate that involving the leg musculature to varying degrees during arm-leg exercise attenuates the hemodynamic differences observed during strict upper body versus strict lower body exercise.\r"

Nine males performed 30 min AC and LC tests at 70% of ergometer-specific peak oxygen uptake (VO2), and a 30 min LC test eliciting a similar VO2 required during the AC test. Blood samples (30 ml) were collected via an indwelling arm catheter at rest, and at minutes 13 and 28 of exercise for determinations of plasma EPI, serum free fatty acid (FFA), serum glycerol (GLY), blood glucose (GLU), and blood lactate (LA) concentrations. At equivalent VO2, higher (P less than 0.05) EPI, LA, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) responses were obtained during AC than LC exercise. However, these physiologic responses were similar during AC and LC exercise at the same relative intensity. No significant differences over time were observed for FFA, GLY, and GLU between AC and LC exercise at either the same absolute or relative intensity. The results support previous hypotheses that AC exercise is physiologically more stressful than LC exercise at the same VO2. The data further indicate that adrenomedullary activity (EPI response) and substrate utilization (LA and RER responses) are regulated by relative exercise intensity and not the exercising muscle mass.\r"

The high prevalence of GI disorders in marathon runners who have lost greater than or equal to 4% body weight supports this theory. To test this theory, the effects of dehydration, and dehydration in combination with endurance running, on gastric emptying (GE) and frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) complaints were tested in this experiment. A complete cross-over study was designed. Sixteen subjects ingested 8 ml.kg BW-1 of a 7% carbohydrate (296 mOsm.kg-1), solution after a euhydration or dehydration regime. Dehydration (4% BW loss) was produced by 60% maximal speed running at 30 degrees C or by intermittent sauna exposure at 100 degrees C. Euhydration experiments were conducted with a 2 h rest period with water administered at 20 and 40 min. Gastric drink volumes were measured every 10 min for 40 min. Emptying curves were compared using semi-log transformation of the percentage emptying data and simple linear regression. The slope of each line was used as a measure of average GE rate. Dehydration-exercise resulted in slower GE than in all other treatments (P less than 0.05). ANOVA revealed significant effects of dehydration (P less than 0.05) and exercise (P less than 0.05), these two effects being additive in delaying GE. GI complaints were reported by 37.5% of the subjects during dehydration-exercise experiments. No GI disturbance was reported in other tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the importance of changes in cardiac filling pressure on the cutaneous vascular responses during exercise, we compared data from eight control (normovolemic) and four hypovolemic (19.5% decrease in plasma volume (PV) induced by diuretics) experiments. Cardiac output was maintained at 13.9 +/- 0.8 l.min-1 during steady state exercise in the two conditions. However, heart rate was higher (P less than 0.05) and stroke volume (SV) was slightly, although not statistically lower during hypovolemic exercise. Forearm venous compliance (FVC) was significantly lower during hypovolemic exercise than during control exercise (P less than 0.05). The increases in forearm blood flow and arterial blood pressure during exercise were not affected significantly by hypovolemia. FVC and SV in both conditions were linearly related to changes in central venous pressure during exercise (r2 = 0.88 and 0.78, respectively). Since changes in arterial pressure during exercise were not correlated with the observed arteriomotor and venomotor responses, we concluded that low pressure baroreceptors may have induced peripheral vascular reflexes, which act to maintain cardiac output during exercise in the heat.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the ventilatory adaptation during gradual ascent to extreme altitude, we studied seven healthy males as part of the 40 d simulated ascent of Mt. Everest in a hypobaric chamber. We measured resting ventilation (VE, l.min-1), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2%), the ventilatory response to oxygen breathing, isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), and hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) at sea level prior to the ascent (760 torr), 14,000 feet (428 torr), 24,000 feet (305 torr), and within 24 h of descent (765 torr). VE increased from 9.3 +/- 1.1 l.min-1 at 760 torr to 23.4 +/- 1.3 l.min-1 at 305 torr and remained elevated at 14.7 +/- 0.7 l.min-1 after descent. Oxygen breathing decreased VE by 9.6 +/- 1.3 l.min-1 at 305 torr. Isocapnic HVR (expressed as a positive slope of VE/SaO2, l.min-1.%SaO2(-1) increased from 0.18 +/- 0.07 at 760 torr to 0.34 +/- 0.11 and 0.38 +/- 0.5 at 428 torr and 305 torr (P less than 0.05) respectively. HVR was elevated further upon return to sea level (0.8 +/- 0.09, P less than 0.05). HCVR (S = VE/PETCO2, l.min-1.torr-1) increased from sea level (S = 4.4 +/- 0.09) to 305 torr (S = 18.7 +/- 3.5, P less than 0.01) and remained elevated upon return to sea level (S = 10.7 +/- 4.6, P less than 0.001). This study is the first to investigate the ventilatory response to such extreme altitude and so soon after descent and shows that hypoxic and hypercapnic responses increase during prolonged progressive hypoxic exposure and remain significantly elevated from pre-ascent levels immediately upon descent.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigators have demonstrated that 5-10 min of fatiguing exercise would lead to respiratory muscle fatigue in normal subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a differential inspiratory pressure response to maximal cycle ergometer exercise in trained and untrained subjects. Six highly trained cross country skiers and five untrained college students were studied prior to and 10, 60, and 120 s postexercise (incremental VO2max to exhaustion). On each occasion, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) was measured at the mouth from residual volume. Prior to exercise, the two groups had similar MIP values. After exercise, the sedentary subjects experienced significant decreases in MIP compared to the preexercise values. These decreases averaged 10%, 17%, and 13% at 10, 60, and 120 s postexercise, respectively. The skiers, on the other hand, showed no evidence of a decrease in MIP postexercise, with the postexercise values being slightly, but not significantly, higher than the preexercise values. From these results, we conclude that maximal exercise results in inspiratory muscle dysfunction in normal subjects but not in athletes training at or near elite levels. Thus, it appears that endurance exercise training induces an adaptive change in the inspiratory muscles that protects them from the acute loss of strength seen following exercise in normal subjects.\r"

Athletes performed their regular regimens of resistance (3 d.wk-1), interval (2 d.wk-1), and judo (5 d.wk-1) training in weeks 1-4. Interval and resistance training volumes increased by 50% in weeks 4-8 and returned to baseline in weeks 9-10. Judo training volume was unchanged in weeks 1-8 but increased by 100% in weeks 9-10. Assessments were made in weeks 2, 4, 8, and 10. Isokinetic strength of elbow and knee extensors and flexors increased significantly from weeks 2 to 4 (3-13%), was unchanged from weeks 4 to 8, and decreased significantly (6-12%) from weeks 4 to 10. Total time for 3 x 300 m intervals increased (P less than 0.05) between weeks 2 and 4 and between weeks 4 and 8, while total time for 5 x 50 m sprints decreased (P less than 0.05) from weeks 8 to 10 (less than 2%). Body fat percentage decreased (P less than 0.05) from weeks 2 to 10. Body weight, submaximal and maximal aerobic power, resting (sleeping) systolic and diastolic pressures, resting (sleeping) submaximal and maximal heart rates, exercising blood lactate levels, and vertical jump performance did not change significantly with increases in training volume. These results suggest that 6 wk of overtraining may affect some but not all aspects of performance and that performance may be affected before symptoms of the overtraining syndrome appear.\r"

  ".W": "Countermovement and arm-swing characterize most jumping. For determination of their effects and interaction, 18 males jumped for maximal height from a force platform in all four combinations of arm-swing/no-arm-swing and countermovement/no-countermovement. For all jumps, vertical velocity peaked 0.03 s before and dropped 6-7% by takeoff. Peak positive power averaged over 3,000 W, and occurred about 0.07 s before takeoff, shortly after peak vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) and just before peak vertical velocity. Both countermovement and arm-swing significantly (P less than 0.05) improved jump height, but arm-swing's effect was greater, enhancing peak total body center of mass (TBCM) rise both pre and posttakeoff. Countermovement only affected the post-takeoff rise. The arm-swing resulted in higher peak VGRF and peak positive power. During countermovement, the use of arms resulted in less unweighting, slower and less extensive TBCM drop, and less negative power. Countermovement increased pretakeoff jump duration by 71-76%, increased average positive power, and yielded large positive and negative impulses. High test-retest reliability was shown for jump descriptive variables. Body weight together with peak posttakeoff TBCM rise effectively predicted peak power (multiple R2 = 0.89, standard error of estimate = 243 W). The results lend insight into which jumping techniques are most appropriate for given sports situations and indicate that a jump test can effectively be used to estimate peak power output.\r"

After completing 60 min of treadmill accommodation, each subject performed two 10 min economy runs at 200 m.min-1. Subjects were also filmed at 100 fps during the last 30 s of each run in order to quantify 20 temporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait descriptors previously associated with RE variation. Following the second run, each subject completed the PMR at 85% of his predicted velocity at VO2max (89% VO2max). One, two, and four days after the PMR, subjects repeated the 10 min economy run. No significant difference (P greater than or equal to 0.05) in RE (range = 42.3-42.6 ml.kg-1.min-1) was observed following the PMR. Biomechanical analyses also indicated that, with the exception of one variable (plantar flexion angle at toe-off), gait characteristics remained unaltered after the PMR. When considered from a cross-disciplinary perspective, these data suggest that a 30 min maximal run does not increase the aerobic demand of running or disrupt the running mechanics of moderately trained male subjects who perform subsequent submaximal runs over the short term.\r"

The comparison included two classical techniques (kick double pole and diagonal stride), two ski skating techniques (V1 skate and marathon skate), and the double pole technique on both classical and skating skis. Eight male cross country ski racers skied each technique for three laps around a 420 m flat, professionally groomed and tracked oval surface at a mean (+/- SD) velocity of 14.2 +/- 0.6 km.h-1. Heart rate was recorded by telemetry and expired gases were collected for determination of minute ventilation and oxygen consumption during the final minute of each bout. Rating of perceived exertion was requested immediately after each bout. It was found that the diagonal stride technique required the highest oxygen consumption, with the V1 skate, marathon skate, and kick double pole techniques inducing a 16% lower (P less than 0.01) oxygen cost, and the double pole technique inducing a 26% lower (P less than 0.01) oxygen cost. Heart rate was also highest (P less than 0.01) with the diagonal stride technique and lowest with the double pole technique. The rating of perceived exertion was greatest (P less than 0.05) for the diagonal stride technique and lowest (P less than 0.05) for the V1 skate technique. These results indicate that the double pole technique has the greatest economy, the diagonal stride technique elicits the greatest physiological demands and has the highest perceived effort, and the V1 skate technique is associated with the lowest perceived effort under the conditions of this study.\r"

No differences (P greater than 0.05) in baseline mood state were observed between the dropouts (N = 62) and those who adhered to the training (N = 22). However, the dropouts possessed significantly lower self-motivation (P less than 0.05) and took longer to complete the rowing task than did the adherers (P less than 0.05). Near the end of the season, rowers were chosen by the coaching staff to compete in regional competition (i.e., successful adherers). Initial self-motivation and ergometer performance did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) between the successful and unsuccessful adherers. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that global mood disturbance (P less than 0.05) increased during the training season in both groups. At the end of the training season, the unsuccessful adherers still possessed significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated mood disturbance, whereas the mood of the successful group had returned to baseline. It is concluded that female rowers who adhere to a season of competitive training have higher self-motivation and superior ergometer performances at the outset than do the eventual dropouts.\r"

Values for % PVS were FT -6.25% compared with VB -8.04% (P less than 0.05), with the correlation between the two methods at r = 0.88. The following equation was established: corrected FT % PVS = (0.8662 * FT) - 2.625; SEE = 2.60%. In order to cross-validate this equation, fifteen additional subjects submitted to VB and FT. Corrected FT % PVS using the established equation resulted in a mean value of 9.53 compared with 10.53% for actual VB % PVS. Although these means were not significantly different, there was approximately a 25% chance that the corrected FT % PVS would be more than one standard error of estimate from the regression line. It was concluded that FT underestimates VB % PVS. However, when limited to group data, FT can be corrected to favorably represent VB % PVS following moderate to heavy cycle ergometer exercise.\r"

Caltracs were found to have very good interinstrument and intersession reliability and to accurately reflect differences in expenditure due to sex, weight, and speed. However, Caltracs consistently over-estimated energy expenditure by an average of 9-13%. The absolute percent error (percent error without consideration of the sign) of the Caltrac was greater, averaging 23%. The correlations between Caltrac and VO2 averaged 0.68-0.74.

One model estimated percent fat from skinfolds (N-Ex %fat) and the other used body mass index (N-Ex BMI) to represent body composition.

A major structural component of basement membranes is type IV collagen, a heterotrimer of two alpha 1(IV) and one alpha 2(IV) chains, which forms a complex, polygonal network associated with other basement membrane components. Here we report that the alpha 1(IV) collagen chain of Caenorhabditis elegans is encoded by the genetic locus emb-9. Mutations in emb-9 cause temperature-sensitive lethality during late embryogenesis. We have identified single nucleotide alterations that substitute glutamic acid for glycine in the triple-helical Gly-X-Y repeat region of the alpha 1(IV) collagen in three emb-9 mutant strains. These results are direct evidence that defects in basement membranes can disrupt embryonic development and form a basis for the genetic analysis of basement membrane function.\r"

  ".U": "91141583\r", 
  ".W": "Hundreds of murine dilute mutations have been identified and analysed, making dilute one of the best genetically characterized of all mammalian loci. The recessive dilute (d) coat colour mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice produces a lightening of coat colour, caused by an abnormal adendritic melanocyte morphology that results in an uneven release of pigment granules into the developing hair shaft. Most dilute alleles (dilute-lethal) also produce a neurological defect, characterized by convulsions and opisthotonus, apparent at 8-10 days of age and continuing until the death of the animal at 2-3 weeks of age. The discovery that the original dilute allele (now termed dilute-viral or dV) is the result of the integration of an ecotropic murine leukaemia provirus has allowed the cloning of genomic DNA and in this study complementary DNA, from the dilute locus. The predicted dilute amino-acid sequence indicates that dilute encodes a novel type of myosin heavy chain, with a tail, or C-terminal, region that has elements of both type II (alpha-helical coiled-coil) and type I (non-coiled-coil) myosin heavy chains. Dilute transcripts are differentially expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues and are very abundant in neurons of the central nervous system, cephalic ganglia, and spinal ganglia. These results suggest an important role for the dilute gene product in the elaboration, maintenance, or function of cellular processes of melanocytes and neurons.\r"

Diploid cells without the intact SPO15 gene product are able to complete premeiotic DNA synthesis and genetic recombination, but are unable to traverse the division cycles. Electron microscopy of blocked cells reveals a duplicated but unseparated spindle-pole body. Thus cells are unable to form a bipolar spindle. Sequence analysis of SPO15 DNA reveals an open reading frame that predicts a protein of 704 amino acids. This protein is identical to VPS1, a gene involved in vacuolar protein sorting in yeast which has significant sequence homology (45% overall, 66% over 300 amino acids) to the microtubule bundling-protein, dynamin. The SPO15 gene product expressed in Escherichia coli can be affinity-purified with microtubules. SPO15 encodes a protein that is likely to be involved in a microtubule-dependent process required for the timely separation of spindle-pole bodies in meiosis.\r"

The yeast U1 and U2 snRNAs base-pair to the 5' splice site and branch-point sequences of introns respectively. The role of the U5 and U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) in splicing is not clear, though a catalytic role for the U6 snRNA has been proposed. Less is known about yeast splicing factors, but the availability of genetic techniques in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to the identification of mutants deficient in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing (prp2-prp27). Several PRP genes have now been cloned and their protein products characterized. The PRP8 protein is a component of the U5 snRNP and associates with the U4/U6 snRNAs/snRNP to form a multi-snRNP particle believed to be important for spliceosome assembly. We have isolated extragenic suppressors of the prp8-1 mutation of S. cerevisiae and present here the preliminary characterization of one of these suppressors, spp81. The predicted amino-acid sequence of the SPP81 protein shows extensive similarity to a recently identified family of proteins thought to possess ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity. The possible role of this putative helicase in nuclear pre-mRNA splicing is discussed.\r"

Xenopus embryos depend on mRNA and protein present in the egg before fertilization (maternal molecules) to provide the information needed for early development. Localization of maternal mRNA gives cells derived from different regions of the egg distinctive capacities for protein synthesis. We show here that An3 mRNA encodes a protein with 74% identity to a protein encoded by the testes-specific mRNA PL10 found in mouse, which is proposed to have RNA helicase activity. Because the gene encoding An3 mRNA is reactivated after gastrulation and remains active throughout embryogenesis, we have examined its distribution in embryonic and adult tissues. Unlike PL10 mRNA, which is primarily restricted to the testes, An3 mRNA is broadly distributed in later development.\r"

An HRAS oncogene activated by a different mechanism was detected in an epidermoid carcinoma. One adenocarcinoma was found to contain an activated RAF gene. Two unidentified transforming genes were detected in a squamous cell carcinoma DNA and two adenocarcinoma DNAs. Eight of 10 lung adenocarcinomas that had formed metastases at the time of surgery were found to contain RAS oncogenes. No significant increase in metastasis was observed in the lung adenocarcinomas that contained one or more 6-kilobase EcoRI alleles of the LMYC gene.

We have isolated a human cDNA for another tyrosine kinase receptor that is highly homologous to the previously described FGFR. Expression of this receptor cDNA in COS cells directs the expression of a 125-kDa glycoprotein. We demonstrate that this cDNA encodes a biologically active receptor by showing that human acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors activate this receptor as measured by 45Ca2+ efflux assays. These data establish the existence of an additional member of the FGFR family that we have named FGFR-3.\r"

The fragment contained an open reading frame, encoding a 189-residue protein, that had a predicted amino acid sequence that concurred with the partial sequence determined for lumazine protein. Considerable sequence similarity was detected between lumazine protein, the yellow fluorescence protein from Vibrio fischeri, and the alpha subunit of riboflavin synthetase (EC 2.5.1.9). A highly conserved sequence in lumazine protein corresponds to the proposed lumazine binding sites in the alpha subunit of riboflavin synthetase. Several secondary structure programs predict the conformation of this site in lumazine protein to be a beta-sheet. A minimal model with three interactions between the ligand and this beta-sheet structure is proposed, which is consistent with the results of NMR and ligand binding studies.\r"

  ".W": "The 10 ligation species of human cyanomethemoglobin were previously found to distribute into three discrete cooperative free energy levels according to a combinatorial code (i.e., dependent on both the number and configuration of ligated subunits). Analysis of this distribution showed that the hemoglobin tetramer occupies a third allosteric state in addition to those of the unligated (T) and fully ligated (R) species. To determine the nature of the intermediate allosteric state, we have studied the effects of pH, temperature, and single-site mutations on its free energy of quaternary assembly, in parallel with corresponding data on the deoxy (T) and fully ligated (R) species. Results indicate that the intermediate allosteric tetramer has the deoxy (T) quaternary structure. This finding, together with the resolved energetic distribution of the 10 microstates reveals a symmetry rule for quaternary switching--i.e., switching from T to R occurs whenever a binding step creates a tetramer with one or more ligated subunits on each side of the alpha 1 beta 2 intersubunit contact. These studies also reveal significant cooperativity within each alpha 1 beta 1 dimer of the T-state tetramer. The ligand-induced tertiary free energy alters binding affinity within the T structure by 170-fold prior to quaternary switching.\r"

Cloning and sequencing the PCR products have revealed five different members of the protein kinase multigene family. These five putative kinases showed varying degrees of amino acid sequence similarity (40-70%) to protein kinases in data bases and contained invariant amino acid residues characteristic of protein kinases. DNA from PCR was labeled and used to isolate several lambda gt11 cDNA clones, including one full-length one (Dd kinase-2). The nucleotide sequence of Dd kinase-2 contained a region identical to one of the cloned kinase fragments amplified by PCR, and based on the deduced amino acid sequence Dd kinase-2 encodes a protein of 479 amino acids. A 350-amino acid kinase domain at the C-terminal end shows high homology to the catalytic domains of protein kinase A, protein kinase C, S-6 kinase of Xenopus, and the suppressor of cdc25 of yeast. The N-terminal domain is highly basic and also contains alternating threonine/proline residues. The cDNA hybridized to a single copy gene but to two differentially regulated mRNAs--a 2.0-kilobase mRNA that is expressed in vegetative cells and a 2.2-kilobase mRNA that is expressed during development.

  ".W": "We constructed diploids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae homozygous for LEU2 and carrying one, two, or four copies of leu2 at ectopic locations and determined the frequency of 3+:1- (LEU2:leu2) meiotic tetrads. Gene conversion between a LEU2 recipient and a leu2 ectopic donor occurred at the same frequency as did gene conversion between allelic copies of LEU2 and leu2. An increase in the number of possible ectopic donor loci did not lead to a proportional increase in the level of ectopic gene conversion. We suggest that the limiting step in meiotic recombination is the activation of a locus to become a recipient in recombination and that once activated, a locus can search the entire genome for a homologous partner with which to recombine. In this respect, this search for a homologous partner resembles the efficient premeiotic methylation/inactivation of duplicated sequences in Ascobolus and Neurospora. These observations support models in which strand exchange serves to align homologous chromosomes prior to their becoming much more fully synapsed by the elaboration of the synaptonemal complex.\r"

  ".U": "91142124\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously described a virulence gene in Vibrio cholerae (irgA) that is more than 850-fold regulated in response to iron. Negative regulation of irgA by iron occurred at the transcriptional level, and there was a dyad symmetric nucleotide sequence in the vicinity of the irgA promoter homologous to the Fur binding site in Escherichia coli. When irgA was cloned into E. coli, we showed that transcription of irgA required 900 base pairs of DNA upstream of the irgA promoter that contained an open reading frame in inverse orientation to irgA. In the present study, we show that this upstream region of DNA encodes a gene in inverse orientation to irgA (named irgB) that is also negatively regulated by iron. Insertional inactivation of irgB on the V. cholerae chromosome leads to loss of expression of a chromosomal irgA'-'phoA fusion (in which the primes indicate truncated genes), which is restored to normal by provision of irgB on a plasmid in trans. DNA sequencing of irgB shows that the protein product (IrgB) is homologous to the LysR family of positive transcriptional activators, and secondary structure analysis of IrgB predicts a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif. The promoters of irgB and irgA are divergent but overlap each other and the previously defined Fur-binding site. We propose a model for iron regulation of irgA expression in V. cholerae. In the presence of sufficient iron, transcription of both irgA and irgB is negatively regulated by a Fur-like protein. In low iron conditions, negative regulation of transcription is removed, and production of IrgB leads to positive transcriptional activation of irgA. It seems likely that the high induction ratio of irgA expression under low- and high-iron conditions (850-fold) relates to the fact that its cognate positive transcriptional activator (irgB) is itself negatively regulated by iron.\r"

The intracerebroventricular administration of the nonselective CCK receptor agonist caerulein or the selective CCK-B receptor agonist pentagastrin increased dose dependently the level of anxiety. CI-988 dose dependently antagonized the anxiogenic response to pentagastrin but not that induced by pentylenetetrazol.

The theory also predicts the signs (+, -) of the correlations between life history variables when body size is held constant.

Radiolabeled COS cells transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA for ELAM-1 were used as probes to screen glycolipids extracted from human leukocytes. COS cells transfected with this plasmid adhered to a subset of sialylated glycolipids resolved on TLC plates or adsorbed on polyvinyl chloride microtiter wells. Adhesion to these glycolipids required calcium but was not inhibited by heparin, chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate, or yeast phosphomannan. Monosaccharide composition, linkage analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the glycolipids indicate that the ligands for ELAM-1 are terminally sialylated lactosylceramides with a variable number of N-acetyllactosamine repeats and at least one fucosylated N-acetylglucosamine residue.\r"

Initially, from each subject, the DNA fragment containing the putative mutation site is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. For each fragment two reaction mixtures are then prepared. Each contains the amplified fragment, a primer (18-mer or longer) whose sequence is identical to the coding sequence of the normal gene immediately flanking the 5' end of the mutation site, and either an alpha-32P-labeled nucleotide corresponding to the normal coding sequence at the mutation site or an alpha-32P-labeled nucleotide corresponding to the mutant sequence. Single nucleotide primer extensions are then carried out and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As predicted by the Watson-Crick base-pair rule, in the wild type only the normal base, in an affected member only the mutant base, and in carriers both the normal and the mutant base are incorporated into the primer. Thus, an essential feature of the present methodology is that the base immediately 3' to the template-bound primer is one of those altered in the mutant, since in this way an extension of the primer by a single base will give an extended molecule characteristic of either the mutant or the wild type. The method is rapid and should be useful in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of every genetic disease with a known sequence variation.\r"

This functional identity may correlate with a structural relationship between the E. coli tyrosine and yeast leucine tRNAs, which are both members of the uncommon type II class of tRNA structures. The results raise the possibility that in evolution a tRNA may be more closely related to a tRNA of different acceptor specificity, but of the same type class, than to one with the same amino acid specificity, but of a different type class.\r"

To identify cis-acting transcriptional elements that confer inducibility by v-src, we isolated the 9E3 promoter upstream region. We found that 1.53 kilobases upstream of the transcriptional start site, when placed in front of a reporter gene, conferred a small degree of inducibility by v-src, in both transient and stable transfections. Two potential AP-1 sites were identified in the 9E3 promoter. AP-1 elements have been implicated previously in mediating a transcriptional response to v-src in fibroblast cell lines. These elements alone do not confer a significant inducibility by v-src in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts. Since the 9E3 mRNA is stabilized in transformed cells, we replaced the 3' untranslated region of the reporter gene with the 9E3 3' untranslated region and found this construct to be strongly responsive to stimulation by v-src. In addition, the 9E3 3' untranslated region increased the response to serum and the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This suggests that a posttranscriptional mechanism plays a major role in the induction of 9E3 expression.\r"

Cell-free translation of synthetic transcripts corresponding to the 5'-terminal 2640 nucleotides of the sense strand of the large dsRNA present in C. parasitica hypovirulent strain EP713 yielded two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 29 and 40 kDa. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that p29 and p40 were encoded by a single large open reading frame. The coding regions for p29 and p40 were mapped to nonoverlapping portions of the 5'- and 3'-terminal domains of the open reading frame, respectively. Kinetic analysis and in vitro translation studies with chimeric transcripts indicated that p29 is autocatalytically released from a nascent polyprotein during translation. Microsequence analysis of the amino terminus of radiolabeled p40 indicated that cleavage occurred between Gly-248 and Gly-249, consistent with translational mapping analysis. Examination of the p29 amino acid sequence revealed similarity to the Potyvirus-encoded cysteine-type proteinase HC-Pro. These results indicate the types of mechanism that operate during gene expression by hypovirulence-associated dsRNA genetic elements.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the importance of the thrombin substrate recognition exosite for fibrinogen binding in the formation of both arterial and venous thrombi, we evaluated the antithrombotic effects of the tyrosine-sulfated dodecapeptide from residues 53-64 of hirudin (H peptide) in a nonhuman primate model. This peptide was studied because it inhibits thrombin cleavages of fibrinogen by simple competition without blocking enzyme catalytic-site function. When an exteriorized arteriovenous access shunt model was used in baboons (Papio anubis), thrombus formation was induced by placing a thrombogenic device made of (i) a segment of tubing coated covalently with type I collagen, which generated platelet-rich thrombi under arterial flow conditions, and (ii) two subsequent annular regions of flow expansion that produced fibrin-rich thrombi typically associated with venous valves and veins. Thrombus formation was quantified by measurements of 111In-labeled platelet and 125I-labeled fibrinogen deposition in both arterial-flow and venous-flow portions of the device. Continuous infusion of H peptide (0.5, 15, and 75 mg/kg) proximal to the device for 40 min interrupted, in a dose-response fashion, formation of fibrin-rich thrombus in the regions of disturbed flow and generation of fibrinopeptide A. In contrast, H peptide did not inhibit the capacity of platelets to deposit on the collagen surface (P greater than 0.2 at all doses) or to form hemostatic plugs (as assessed by measurements of bleeding time; P greater than 0.1 at all doses). These findings suggest that, by competitive inhibition of fibrinogen binding to thrombin, fibrin-rich venous-type thrombus formation may be selectively prevented. This strategy may be therapeutically attractive for preserving normal platelet function when conventional anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated.\r"

To elucidate the relationship between the presence of anti-Tax antibody and the transmission of the viral infection, annual consecutive serum samples from married couples serologically discordant or concordant for HTLV-I were examined. These included 5 individuals whose spouses seroconverted during this 5-year follow-up study period. The samples were tested by a Western blot assay using a recombinant Tax protein as the antigen. The results showed that 24 of 32 (75%) men in the concordant couples (both husband and wife were HTLV-I carriers) had anti-Tax antibody, while only 5 of 18 (27.8%) men in the discordant couples (husband was carrier and wife was seronegative to HTLV-I) were positive for anti-Tax antibody (P = 0.0012). Furthermore, all spouses of the 5 seroconverters (4 women and 1 man) had anti-Tax antibody, while only 23 of 46 (50%) age-matched randomly selected HTLV-I carriers from the discordant-couple group had anti-Tax antibody. When the data were analyzed by gender, all husbands of the female seroconverters had anti-Tax antibodies, which was significantly higher than the prevalence of anti-Tax antibodies in men who did not transmit the virus to their spouses during the follow-up period (P = 0.017). In addition, antibody reactivity to other HTLV-I antigens (including Env gp46, transmembrane protein gp21, and Gag p19 and p24) were examined. The results indicated no significant differences between the prevalence of antibody reactivity to any of the antigens in the spouses of the seroconverters and the reference group. We conclude that the presence of anti-Tax antibody in men may indicate a high risk of viral transmission to their wives via heterosexual routes.\r"

In order to understand the origin of insoluble aggregates, we asked whether morphological inclusions were always correlated with insolubility. The strain expressing actin was compared to one that expresses part of the myosin tail; the latter strain yields soluble protein after various cell lysis or disruption procedures. Morphological inclusions were observed in both strains, indicating there is no obligate relationship between solubility and inclusions. Studies presented here suggest that extreme insolubility results from coaggregation of the actin with bacterial outer membrane components upon bacterial lysis. The properties of the outer membrane have been exploited in the development of nondenaturing procedures that yield soluble actin. One procedure involves the disruption of coaggregates with sarkosyl detergent (N-laurylsarcosine); another prevents the formation of coaggregates by lysing in the presence of sarkosyl. These methods may be useful for other proteins that become insoluble after bacterial expression.\r"

While cyclic AMP stimulation of ICa is mediated by the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, inhibition of ICa by cyclic GMP in frog heart is largely mediated by activation of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The present patch-clamp study reveals that, in rat ventricular cells, cyclic GMP can also regulate ICa via activation of endogenous cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP-PK). Indeed, the effect of cyclic GMP on ICa was mimicked by intracellular perfusion with the proteolytic active fragment of purified cGMP-PK. Moreover, cGMP-PK immunoreactivity was detected in pure rat ventricular myocytes by using a specific polyclonal antibody. These results demonstrate a dual mechanism for the inhibitory action of cyclic GMP in heart, as well as a physiological role for cGMP-PK in the control of mammalian heart function.\r"

The loci fell into three natural groups of five, five, and four loci. The five loci of the first group are invariant, or nearly so, throughout the range of the species. The genetic organization of the loci of this set is defined by a single five-locus genotype; each allele of this predominant genotype is a \"wild-type\" allele that contributes favorably to adaptedness in all single-locus and multilocus configurations regardless of environment. Although allelic diversity is high in Spain for the nine loci of the second and third sets, log-linear analyses showed that these loci are tied together in Spanish populations through complex networks of overlapping lower-order interlocus interactions. The ancestral Spanish and colonial Californian gene pools are closely similar in allelic composition on a locus-by-locus basis; however, Spanish allelic configurations at two-locus and higher-order levels are usually different from and much less tightly organized than in Californian populations. We conclude that the major force involved in the evolution of the colonial populations was selection that led to reorganization, at the interlocus level, of the ancestral Spanish allelic ingredients into different multilocus genotypes adapted to Californian habitats.\r"

We have examined the relationship between genetic diversity and adaptedness for 14 allozyme loci in A. barbata and its diploid ancestors in samples collected from diverse habitats in Israel and Spain. The relationship varied from locus to locus: superior adaptedness was associated with genetic uniformity for five loci, in part with genetic uniformity and in part with genetic diversity (monomorphism for a single heteroallelic quadriplex) for one locus, and with allelic diversity in the form of heteroallelic quadriplexes combined with genotypic diversity in the form of complex polymorphisms among different homoallelic and/or heteroallelic quadriplexes for the eight remaining loci. These results indicate that allelic diversity fixed in nonsegregating form through chromosome doubling was an important factor in the evolution of adaptedness in A. barbata. However, it is unlikely that heterosis associated with heterozygosity contributed significantly to superior adaptedness in either the diploids or the tetraploid because virtually all loci (approximately 99%) were homozygous in the Avena diploids and tetraploid.\r"

  ".W": "The helicase action of the Escherichia coli UvrAB complex on a covalently closed circular DNA template was monitored using bacterial DNA topoisomerase I, which specifically removes negative supercoils. In the presence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I and ATP, the UvrAB complex gradually introduced positive supercoils into the input relaxed plasmid DNA template. Positive supercoils were not produced when E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was replaced by eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I or when both E. coli and eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases I were added simultaneously. These results suggest that like other DNA helix-tracking processes, the ATP-dependent action of the UvrAB complex on duplex DNA simultaneously generates both positive and negative supercoils, which are not constrained by protein binding but are torsionally strained. The supercoiling activity of UvrAB on UV-damaged DNA was also studied using UV-damaged plasmid DNA and a mutant UvrA protein that lacks the 40 C-terminal amino acids and is defective in preferential binding to UV-damaged DNA. UvrAB was found to preferentially supercoil the UV-damaged DNA template, whereas the mutant protein supercoiled UV-damaged and undamaged DNA with equal efficiency. Our results therefore suggest that the DNA helix-tracking activity of UvrAB may be involved in searching and/or prepriming the damaged DNA for UvrC incision. A possible role of supercoiled domains in the incision process is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Substance P (SP) immunoreactivity is detectable in the rat pituitary by RIA; however, immunolocalization has been difficult. We used a sensitive immunogold silver-enhancement staining technique to cytochemically locate SP in the gland. SP-immunoreactive (SP-ir) cells were seen in anterior pituitary (AP), and occasional SP-ir fibers and terminals were seen in both AP and posterior pituitary. Colocalization studies showed the vast majority of SP-ir cells in the male AP to be also immunoreactive for growth hormone (GH). These GH/SP-ir cells represent approximately 23% of the somatotroph population in the male. SP-ir cells did not colocalize with lactotrophs, gonadotrophs, or corticotrophs; however, rare thyroid-stimulating hormone/SP-ir cells were found in the male AP. Comparisons of pituitaries from males and females revealed that females have 70% fewer SP-ir cells and that only approximately 6% of the somatotrophs in the female express SP. This sexual dimorphism is diminished in 6-day ovariectomized rats because this treatment increases the GH/SP-ir cell population 3-fold. This result suggests that the previously reported estrogen-induced decrease in SP gene and peptide expression in the pituitary occurs, at least in part, in a subpopulation of somatotrophs. To test this hypothesis, distribution of SP-ir cells was examined in pituitaries from estrogen- and oil-treated ovariectomized rats. Estrogen reduced the percentage of somatotrophs with SP immunoreactivity by 70% compared with ovariectomized oil-treated controls, indicating that estrogen most likely regulates SP levels in the pituitary by acting on a subpopulation of somatotrophs to suppress SP expression. Estrogen does not appear to alter SP immunoreactivity that is detected in the additional population of SP cells that colocalize with thyroid-stimulating hormone. These SP-expressing thyrotrophs were seen 6-fold more frequently in the female than in the male pituitary, regardless of steroid status. These studies reveal that males have more total SP-ir cells in the AP than do females and that there is a sexually dimorphic pattern of SP distribution in the gland. Males have a higher percentage of SP-ir GH cells, whereas females have more SP-ir thyrotrophs than do males. Identification of independently regulated SP-ir somatotroph and thyrotroph populations provides a basis for investigating the roles of SP in autocrine or paracrine regulation of pituitary hormone secretion.\r"

Although the binding of IL-2 to its receptor has been well characterized, the molecular mechanisms by which IL-2 transmits its signal from the membrane to the interior of the cell are poorly understood. Like most other growth factors, IL-2 causes rapid phosphorylation of proteins within its target cells. Unlike many other growth factors, however, the known subunits of the IL-2 receptor lack tyrosine-specific kinase activity, and little is known about the kinases whose activities are regulated by IL-2. Here we show that IL-2 (but not IL-4) induces rapid phosphorylation of the p72-74 serine/threonine-specific kinase encoded by the c-Raf-1 protooncogene in an IL-2-dependent murine T-cell line, CTLL-2, and that this phosphorylation is associated with increased kinase activity in p72-74 Raf-1-containing immune complexes. The concentration dependence of IL-2-mediated elevations in Raf-1 kinase activity correlated well with IL-2-stimulated proliferation of CTLL-2 cells. Furthermore, much of the IL-2-stimulated phosphorylation of p72-74 Raf-1 occurred on tyrosines. To our knowledge, the Raf-1 kinase represents the first endogenous substrate of an IL-2-regulated tyrosine kinase to be identified.\r"

  ".U": "91142147\r", 
  ".W": "Solution structures for many proteins have been determined to date utilizing interproton distance constraints estimated from two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (2D NOE) spectra. Although the simple isolated spin pair approximation (ISPA) generally used can result in systematic errors in distances, the large number of constraints enables protein structure to be defined with reasonably high resolution. Effects of these systematic errors on the resulting protein structure are examined. Iterative relaxation matrix calculations, which account for dipolar interactions between all protons in a molecule, can accurately determine internuclear distances with little or no a priori knowledge of the molecular structure. The value of this additional complexity is also addressed. To assess these distance determination methods, hypothetical \"experimental\" data, including random noise and peak overlap, are calculated for an arbitrary \"true\" protein structure. Three methods of obtaining distance constraints from 2D NOE peak intensities are examined: one entails a conservative use of ISPA, one assumes the ISPA to be fairly accurate, and one utilizes an iterative relaxation matrix method called MARDIGRAS (matrix analysis of relaxation for discerning the geometry of an aqueous structure), developed in this laboratory. A distance geometry algorithm was used to generate a family of structures for each distance set. The quality of the average structure from each family was good. The root-mean-square deviation of that average structure from the true structure was improved about 2-5% using the more restrictive rather than the more conservative ISPA approach. Use of MARDIGRAS in a conservative fashion--i.e., with a poor initial model--resulted in improvement in the root-mean-square deviation by 8-15%. With a better initial model, MARDIGRAS obtained even more accurate distances. MARDIGRAS also permits analysis of 2D NOE data at longer mixing times, yielding additional distances. Use of more restrictive ISPA distances did, however, result in a few systematically incorrect structural features in local regions of the protein, producing distortions of 2-3 A. Comparison between experimental data and spectra calculated for the structures correlates with root-mean-square deviation, offering a method of structure evaluation. An R factor for evaluating fit between experimental and calculated 2D NOE intensities is proposed.\r"

A 173-base-pair region of the MLC gene enhancer, including these three sites, retains full enhancer function when transfected into muscle cells. Whereas mutation of either upstream MyoD binding site (A or B) has a mild effect on muscle-specific enhancer activity, mutation of the third MyoD binding site (C) substantially weakens the enhancer, both in muscle cells or in nonmuscle cells cotransfected with a MyoD, myogenin, or myf5 expression vector. Site C is necessary but insufficient, since double mutation of two MyoD binding sites (A plus B) abrogates enhancer activity. Thus, site C requires either site A or B for enhancer function. This study shows a hierarchy of function among the three MyoD binding sites in the MLC enhancer. We propose that a protein-DNA complex is formed with at least two of these sites (A and C or B and C) to effect activation of the locus encoding MLC1/3 during myogenesis.\r"

This importance pertains both intraspecifically in adaptation and interspecifically in speciation. Neurophysiologic, behavioral, and anatomic findings in this study suggest that the mechanism of long-distance seismic communication is basically somatosensory and is independent of the auditory mechanism. Seismic communication thus appears to be a channel of communication important in the evolution of subterranean mammals that display major adaptation to life underground.\r"

The immediate effect of ATP is to enhance secretion; more prolonged exposure to the nucleotide results in inhibition. These receptor-mediated actions of ATP involve the activation of at least two separate classes of GTP-binding protein. Results from electrophysiological experiments reported here demonstrate that the modulatory actions of ATP can, in large part, be explained by the effects of the nucleotide on inward calcium current. ATP shows a rapid enhancement and a slower, persistent inhibition of the depolarization-induced inward current.\r"

Some strains contain smaller, S, double-stranded RNAs, derived from M1 by internal deletion. Particles containing these defective interfering RNAs can displace M1 particles by faster replication and thus convert the host strain to a nonkiller phenotype. In this work, we report the development of an assay in which the expression of S plus-strand from an inducible plasmid causes the loss of M1 particles. This assay provides a convenient method for identifying in vivo cis-acting sequences important in viral replication and packaging. We have mapped the sequence involved in interference to a region of 132 base pairs that includes two sequences similar to the viral binding site sequence previously identified in L1 by in vitro experiments.\r"

We have isolated the genomic region encoding the alternative 5' terminus of dystrophin used in the brain. Primer extension and polymerase chain reaction assays on RNA demonstrate that this region contains an alternative promoter for dystrophin used in the brain. Physical mapping of this region indicates that this brain promoter is located greater than 90 kilobases 5' to the promoter used in muscle and 400 kilobases from exon 2 to which it is spliced. The large physical distance between the promoters, taken together with their known tissue selectivities, suggests that in certain patients a deletion of either dystrophin promoter might give rise to reduced dystrophin expression selective to brain or muscle. We have identified one such individual with specific deletion of the dystrophin muscle promoter, giving rise to Becker muscular dystrophy, and we predict that specific loss of the brain promoter may be one cause of X chromosome-linked mental retardation.\r"

Infected cells were concentrated in regions where spongiform lesions and gliosis are detected (lumbosacral spinal cord, brainstem, deep cerebellar regions), suggesting a causative link between the level of virus expression and the degree of pathological changes in this disease. However, viral expression was not in itself sufficient to cause disease, since significant viral expression was observed in regions that did not exhibit pathological changes (cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, peripheral nervous system). In both diseased and nondiseased regions, endothelial and glial cells were identified as the main target cells. Neurons in diseased regions did not show viral expression. The regional distribution of the spongiform changes appears to be laid down very early following infection, since expression could be detected at 10 days postinfection in regions that become diseased. These results indicate that nonneuronal cells have distinct properties in various regions of the central nervous system and suggest an indirect mechanism of neuronal loss consequent to viral expression in nonneuronal cells.\r"

Influence of the midbrain in facilitating focal vision is shown by the restoration of form discriminations after section of the superior collicular commissure. It is hypothesized that the perceptual defect after lesion in the suprasylvian cortex is due to poor spatial attention and its restoration after midbrain lesion is due to improved function of those collicular cells that mediate orienting of attention.\r"

  ".W": "During exercise, increased energy demands are met by increased glucose production that occurs simultaneously with the increased glucose uptake. We had previously observed that, during exercise, metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR) increases markedly in normal, but only marginally in poorly controlled diabetic dogs. We wished to determine (i) whether in a more general model of stress matched increases in rate of appearance of glucose and MCR also occur, or if MCR is suppressed, as during catecholamine infusion; and (ii) whether diabetes affects stress-induced changes in rate of glucose appearance and MCR. Therefore, we injected carbachol (27 nmol/50 microliters), an analog of acetylcholine, intracerebroventricularly in seven conscious dogs before and after induction of alloxan diabetes. In normal dogs, plasma epinephrine and cortisol increased 4- to 5-fold, whereas norepinephrine and glucagon doubled. Plasma insulin, however, remained unchanged. Tracer-determined hepatic glucose production increased rapidly, but transiently, by 2.5-fold. This increment can be fully explained by the observed increments in the counterregulatory hormones. Surprisingly, however, MCR also promptly increased, and therefore, plasma glucose changed only marginally. After induction of diabetes, the animals were given intracerebroventricular carbachol while plasma glucose was maintained at moderate hyperglycemia (9.0 +/- 0.4 mM). Increments in counterregulatory hormones were similar to those seen in normal dogs, except for exaggerated norepinephrine release. Peripheral insulin levels were higher in diabetic than in normal dogs; however, MCR was markedly reduced and the lipolytic response to stress increased, indicating insulin resistance. Interestingly, the hyperglycemic response to stress was 6-fold greater in diabetic than normal animals, relating mainly to the failure of MCR to rise. Plasma lactate increased equivalently in diabetic and normal animals despite suppression of MCR in the diabetics, indicating either greater muscle glycogenolysis and/or impairment in glucose oxidation. We conclude that in this stress model MCR increases as in exercise in normal but not in diabetic dogs. We speculate that glucose uptake in stress could be mediated through an insulin-dependent neural mechanism.\r"

In this study, interactions between the four promoter sites were examined by means of a series of insertion mutations that increased the linker region between adjacent elements by roughly half or complete DNA helical turns. Unexpectedly, transcriptional activity for all three sets of linker mutants, as assayed with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, was found to vary in a fashion resembling a damped sinusoid with a period of roughly 10 base pairs, where the sinusoidal maxima appeared when length was increased by half-integral number of helix turns. We present a model which states that in the undistorted wild-type 5' flanking sequence, linker domains position each of the four promoter sites on the helix face opposite that of its immediate neighbors; when any of the three linkers is increased by approximately a half-integral number of helix turns, pairs of neighboring promoter sites are brought into alignment. We propose that this is the required orientation for inducing skeletal muscle-specific promoter activity, achieved in the wild-type promoter as a result of protein-induced torsional deformation.\r"

Individual B repeats are variously associated with other tRNA genes, including those specifying tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Arg), and tRNA(Glu2). The centromere I region (cen1) contains at least six tRNA genes in two copies of the B' repeated element, including genes specifying tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Glu3). Multiple tandemly arranged clusters of tRNA genes are presumably conserved due to restricted recombination frequencies in the centromere regions.\r"

  ".W": "It has been found that the principal biochemical pathway activated in B cells stimulated by antigen- or anti-immunoglobulin-mediated crosslinking of surface immunoglobulin is that resulting in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate with generation of diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate. Recent evidence suggests that surface immunoglobulin-mediated B-cell activation can proceed without detectable increases in the concentration of either diacylglycerol or intracellular Ca2+ concentration, implicating involvement of other non-protein-kinase-C/Ca2(+)-dependent signal-transduction pathways. Therefore, we sought evidence for activation of a signaling pathway that is associated with growth regulation in other cell types--i.e., the protein-tyrosine kinases. We now show that crosslinking of membrane immunoglobulin by mitogenic antibodies leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates, consistent with the induction of a tyrosine kinase activity. This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation is weakly (if at all) stimulated by other B-cell mitogens, including phorbol esters and ionophores, and does not require the presence of detectable protein kinase C. Furthermore, inhibition of anti-immunoglobulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis does not inhibit activation of this tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. These findings suggest that occupancy of the membrane immunoglobulin receptor may induce multiple pathways of activation.\r"

  ".W": "Prodynorphin (proDyn) gene expression was examined in the rat adrenal gland. In situ hybridization revealed a heterogenous proDyn mRNA distribution limited almost exclusively to the adrenal cortex; the inner cortical layers contained the highest amounts. In the adrenal medulla, only scattered single cells were seen. By Northern (RNA) blot analysis, adrenocortical proDyn mRNA levels were highly abundant but of smaller size than proDyn transcripts found in the brain. Low levels of the brain-size proDyn mRNA transcript were detected but restricted to the medulla. A discrepancy was suggested when comparing the high abundance of proDyn mRNA levels with the low levels of proDyn-derived peptide in the adrenal. A hypothesis of nontranslation of the shorter proDyn mRNA by adrenocortical cells was rejected because polysomal loading analysis suggests that the mRNA is translated. We propose that adrenocortical proDyn-derived peptides are not targeted for storage but are released shortly after synthesis, thus accounting for low peptide levels. We also measured proDyn mRNA levels in response to stimuli known to affect adrenocortical cells and their most important function--steroidogenesis. Adrenals from hypophysectomized rats had less proDyn mRNA by a factor of 5 than adrenals from normal sham-operated rats. Normal levels were restored by adrenocorticotrophic hormone administration, indicating a potential importance of adrenal proDyn in the hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis.\r"

This limits the potential of fibroblast-mediated gene therapy in humans. We have studied the phenomenon of decreased production in rats by using retroviral vectors carrying genes encoding human adenosine deaminase and neomycin phosphotransferase. While transplanted skin fibroblasts containing vector sequences persisted at constant levels for at least 8.5 mo, vector expression decreased by greater than 1500-fold after 1 mo. Cellular or antibody-mediated immune responses were not detected in transplanted animals, and expression could not be restored in fibroblasts recultivated from the grafts. This phenomenon is reminiscent of sequence-specific gene inactivation observed in other cell types. Because genetic manipulation and expression of foreign proteins did not affect survival of the transplanted cells, effective long-term therapy may be possible with the use of alternative gene regulatory elements.\r"

Here we present a simple in vitro system that carries out the integration reaction and the use of this system to probe the mechanism of integration. The only HIV protein necessary is the integration (IN) protein, which has been overexpressed in insect cells and then partially purified. DNA substrates are supplied as oligonucleotides that match the termini of the linear DNA product of reverse transcription. In the presence of HIV IN protein, oligonucleotide substrates are cleaved to generate the recessed 3' ends that are the precursor for integration, and the cleaved molecules are efficiently inserted into a DNA target. Analysis of reaction products reveals that HIV IN protein joins 3' ends of the viral DNA to 5' ends of cuts made by IN protein in the DNA target. We have also used this assay to characterize the sequences at the ends of the viral DNA involved in integration. The assay provides a simple screen for testing candidate inhibitors of HIV IN protein; some such inhibitors might have useful antiviral activity.\r"

In contrast, the chromatin templates with a histone/DNA mass ratio of 9.0 supported neither homologous pairing nor strand exchange. The addition of histone H1, in stoichiometric amounts, to chromatin templates quells homologous pairing. The pairing of chromatin templates with nucleoprotein filaments of RecA protein-single-stranded DNA proceeded without the production of detectable networks of DNA, suggesting that coaggregates are unlikely to be the intermediates in homologous pairing. The application of these observations to strategies for gene targeting and their implications for models of genetic recombination are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "91142170\r", 
  ".W": "Myogenin and MyoD are proteins that bind to the regulatory regions of a battery of skeletal muscle genes and can activate their transcription during muscle differentiation. We have recently found that both proteins interact with the enhancer of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha subunit, a gene that is regulated by innervation. This observation prompted us to study if myogenin and MyoD transcript levels are also regulated by skeletal muscle innervation. Using Northern blot analysis, we found that MyoD and myogenin mRNA levels begin to decline at embryonic day 17 and attain adult levels in muscle of newborn and 3-week-old mice, respectively. In contrast, nAChR mRNAs are highest in newborn and 1-week-old mouse muscle and decline thereafter to reach adult levels in 3-week-old mice. To determine if the down-regulation of myogenin and MyoD mRNA levels during development is due to innervation, we quantitated message levels in adult calf muscles after denervation. We found that in denervated muscle myogenin and MyoD mRNAs reach levels that are approximately 40- and 15-fold higher than those found in innervated muscle. Myogenin mRNAs begin to accumulate rapidly between 8 and 16 hr after denervation, and MyoD transcripts levels begin to increase sharply between 16 hr and 1 day after denervation. The increases in myogenin and MyoD mRNA levels precede the rapid accumulation of nAChR alpha-subunit transcripts; receptor mRNAs begin to accumulate significantly after 1 day of denervation. The effects of denervation are specific because skeletal alpha-actin mRNA levels are not affected by denervation. In addition, we found that the repression of myogenin and MyoD expression by innervation is due, at least in part, to \"electrical activity.\" Direct stimulation of soleus muscle with extracellular electrodes repressed the increase of myogenin and MyoD transcripts after denervation by 4- to 3-fold, respectively. In view of these results, it is interesting to speculate that myogenin and/or MyoD may regulate a repertoire of skeletal muscle genes that are down-regulated by electrical activity.\r"

The reactions also identify at least one polymorphic B-G determinant encoded by the B-F/B-L region of the chicken MHC. The serology and tissue distribution of B-G molecules are as complex as those of mammalian MHC class I and class II molecules. These facts, taken with certain functional data, lead us to suggest that B-G molecules have an important role in the selection of B cells in the chicken bursa.\r"

The enrichment of the lipotropic compound chlor-promazine in domains in intact erythrocytes also suggested that the domains are lipid-enriched regions. Similar membrane domains were present in erythrocyte ghosts. The phospholipid enrichment was increased in the domains by inducing membrane protein aggregation. Double-labeling experiments were done to determine the relative distributions of different phospholipids in the membrane. Vesicles made from extracted lipids did not show the presence of domains consistent with the conclusion that membrane proteins were responsible for creating the domains. Overall, it was found that large domains exist in the red blood cell membrane with unequal enrichment of the different phospholipid species.\r"

Pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4) photoproducts] represent one of the two major adduct classes found after UV irradiation of DNA and were shown to play an important role in UV-induced mutagenesis. After UV light treatment of cells, DNA is prepared and chemically cleaved at (6-4) photoproducts with piperidine. Gene-specific fragments are then amplified from total genomic DNA by use of a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. Analysis of the human chromosome X-linked phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) gene's promoter has shown that the frequency of (6-4) photoproducts expressed as piperidine-labile sites is (i) high at TpC and CpC dinucleotides, (ii) dependent on the nearest-neighbor bases, (iii) inhibited by the binding of a transcription factor, and (iv) different for DNA derived from the active and inactive X chromosome. This latter difference is mainly a consequence of the presence of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in CpG dinucleotides on the inactive X chromosome. 5-Methylcytosine in the sequences Tm5CG and Cm5CG inhibits the formation of (6-4) photoproducts. Thus, in addition to in vivo mapping of a DNA adduct at nucleotide resolution, we also report another method for methylation analysis and photofootprinting.\r"

We showed previously by using the vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase expression system that when cells expressing the nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (NS), and the large polymerase protein (L) of VSV were superinfected with defective interfering (DI) particles, rapid and efficient replication and amplification of (DI) particle RNA occurred. Here, we demonstrate that all five VSV proteins can be expressed simultaneously when cells are contransfected with plasmids containing the matrix protein (M) gene and the glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV in addition to plasmids containing the genes for the N, NS, and L proteins. When cells coexpressing all five VSV proteins were superinfected with DI particles, which because of their defectiveness are unable to express any viral proteins or to replicate, DI particle replication, assembly, and budding were observed and infectious DI particles were released into the culture fluids. Omission of either the M or G protein expression resulted in no DI particle budding. The vector-supported DI particles were similar in size and morphology to the authentic DI particles generated from cells coinfected with DI particles and helper VSV and their infectivity could be blocked by anti-VSV or anti-G antiserum. The successful replication, assembly, and budding of DI particles from cells expressing all five VSV proteins from cloned cDNAs provide a powerful approach for detailed structure-function analysis of the VSV gene products in each step of the replicative cycle of the virus.\r"

TrfA. An in vitro replication system was developed from Escherichia coli that is active with either the intact eight-iteron RK2 origin or a minimal five-iteron RK2 origin when purified TrfA protein is provided. Using this in vitro replication system, we have examined the mechanism(s) of copy-number control. It was found that two or more RK2 iterons present on a supercoiled compatible plasmid molecule are capable of specifically inhibiting in vitro the replication of either functional RK2 origin plasmid and that this inhibition is not overcome by adding increasing amounts of TrfA protein. A mutant TrfA protein, TrfA-33(cop254D), that increases the copy number of an RK2 origin in vivo exhibits replication kinetics and activity levels in this in vitro system similar to that of the wild-type protein. However, RK2 in vitro replication initiated by TrfA-33(cop254D) has a much reduced sensitivity to iteron inhibition. These data support a model for RK2 copy-number control that involves intermolecular coupling between TrfA-bound iterons.\r"

  ".W": "C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice carry the scid mutation and are severely deficient in both T cell- and B cell-mediated immunity, apparently as a result of defective V(D)J joining of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene elements. In the present studies, we have defined the tissue, cellular, and molecular basis of another characteristic of these mice: their hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. Bone marrow stem cells, intestinal crypt cells, and epithelial skin cells from scid mice are 2- to 3-fold more sensitive when irradiated in situ than are congenic BALB/c or C.B-17 controls. Two independently isolated embryo fibroblastic scid mouse cell lines display similar hypersensitivities to gamma-rays. In addition, these cell lines are sensitive to cell killing by bleomycin, which also produces DNA strand breaks, but not by the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C or UV irradiation. Measurement of the rejoining of gamma-ray-induced DNA double-strand breaks by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicates that these animals are defective in this repair system. This suggests that the gamma-ray sensitivity of the scid mouse fibroblasts could be the result of reduced repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, a common factor may participate in both the repair of DNA double-strand breaks as well as V(D)J rejoining during lymphocyte development. This murine autosomal recessive mutation should prove extremely useful in fundamental studies of radiation-induced DNA damage and repair.\r"

HCFC-123 and its analog halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane) were studied in rats by 19F NMR spectroscopy, and we found that a trifluoroacetylated lysine adduct was formed with liver proteins. Also, the pattern of proteins immunoreactive with hapten-specific anti-trifluoroacetylprotein antibodies was identical in livers of HCFC-123- and halothane-exposed rats. Because halothane causes an idiosyncratic, and sometimes fatal, hepatitis that is associated with an immune response against several trifluoroacetylated liver proteins, the present findings raise the possibility that humans exposed to HCFC-123 or structurally related HCFCs may be at risk of developing an immunologically mediated hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "In most cervical carcinoma cells the E6 and E7 genes of specific human papillomaviruses are transcribed from viral sequences integrated into host cell chromosomes. Glucocorticoids activate the promoter elements of various human papillomaviruses in transient-expression assays. We have analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the transcription rate of human papillomavirus 18 E6 and E7 genes integrated at different chromosomal sites in four cervical cancer cell lines. Dexamethasone led to an increase in the transcription rate of the integrated E6-E7 sequences in C4-1 and C4-2 cells but led to a decrease in SW 756 cells and did not affect the transcription rate in HeLa cells. However, when the viral promoter elements derived from HeLa or SW 756 cells, in which dexamethasone does not activate transcription of the integrated E6-E7 sequences, were tested in transient-expression assays within the same cell lines, dexamethasone consistently activated the viral promoter. It thus appears that dominant regulatory mechanisms presumably depending on the chromosomal integration site are able to override the response of the viral promoter to steroid hormones. The growth rate of all dexamethasone-treated cell lines correlated consistently with the expression of the papillomavirus E6 and E7 genes, supporting their role in the maintenance of the proliferative phenotype of cervical carcinoma cells. Since human papillomaviruses are integrated into the host cell genome at variable, presumably randomly selected chromosomal loci, regulatory mechanisms that influence viral gene expression, and hence cell growth, may differ among cancers of independent clonal origin.\r"

The cDNA clone was sequenced and found to have an insert of 1226 nucleotides. The deduced primary structure of hCOMT is composed of 271 amino acid residues with the predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa. At its N terminus it has a hydrophobic segment of 21 amino acid residues that may be responsible for insertion of hCOMT into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The primary structure of hCOMT exhibits high homology to the porcine partial cDNA sequence (93%). The deduced amino acid sequence contains two tryptic peptide sequences (T-22, T-33) found in porcine liver catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The coding region of hCOMT cDNA was placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter to transfect human kidney 293 cells. The endogenous COMT activity, which was approximately 9.98 units per mg of protein in the untransfected cells, increased to 206 units per mg of protein upon transfection with a plasmid containing the COMT cDNA. The COMT activity of recombinant protein was inhibited competitively (IC50 = 700 nM) by the selective COMT inhibitor Ro 40-7592. An anti-COMT monoclonal antibody recognized, on immunoblots, a major polypeptide with apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa, in reasonable agreement with the predicted molecular mass. The recombinant hCOMT was shown by immunoblot analysis to be mainly associated with the membrane fraction. RNA blot analysis revealed one COMT mRNA transcript of 1.4 kilobases in Hep G2 poly(A)+ RNA.\r"

Amino acid substitutions between the GABAA receptor alpha subunits were analyzed for their effect on the binding of compounds to the benzodiazepine site. By converting ever smaller regions of the alpha 3 subunit sequence to that of the alpha 1 subunit, we show that a single substitution (glycine for glutamic acid) increases the affinity for several compounds approximately 10-fold without changing the affinity for nonselective compounds. Hence, the identified amino acids may interact directly with the ligand and define part of the benzodiazepine binding sites in these receptors.\r"

Recently, we have demonstrated that the protein could be a precursor of bioactive peptides capable of modulating catecholamine secretion from cultured adrenal medullary chromaffin cells. Here we cleaved CGA purified from bovine chromaffin granules with endoproteinase Lys-C, and we isolated and partially sequenced the peptide inhibiting catecholamine secretion from cultured chromaffin cells. A corresponding synthetic peptide composed of the first 20 N-terminal amino acids produced a dose-dependent inhibition in the 10(-9) to 10(-6) M range (with an ID50 of 5 nM) of the catecholamine secretion evoked by carbamoylcholine or by potassium at a depolarizing concentration. This peptide affected secretagogue-induced calcium fluxes but did not alter sodium fluxes. It was found to increase desensitization of cell responses and to modify the kinetics of catecholamine release. Our results indicate that the peptide is extracellularly generated from CGA by a calcium-dependent proteolytic mechanism. We suggest that this peptide, named chromostatin, may be an endocrine modulator of catecholamine-associated responses.\r"

  ".U": "91142186\r", 
  ".W": "Studies on the structural origin of the DNA alkylation selectivity of the antitumor antibiotic (+)-CC-1065 are detailed. The sites of alkylation of double-stranded DNA were examined for simple derivatives of 7-methyl-1,2,8,8a-tetrahydrocycloprop[1,2-c]pyrrolo[3,2-e]indol- 4(5H)-one (CPI), (+)-CC-1065, and agents incorporating the parent 1,2,7,7a-tetrahydrocycloprop[1,2-c]indol-4-one (CI) left-hand subunit. The CI subunit of the agents is a much more reactive alkylating agent than the natural CPI alkylation subunit of CC-1065. Consequently, simple derivatives of CI were found to alkylate double-stranded DNA under milder conditions than were simple derivatives of CPI, and the marked similarities in the CI and CPI DNA alkylation profiles illustrate that CI represents the minimum pharmacophore of CPI. Comparisons of the DNA alkylation profiles of (+)-N-butyloxycarbonyl-CPI, (+)-N-acetyl-CPI, and (+)-CC-1065 revealed distinctions in the CPI and (+)-CC-1065 sites of alkylation, whereas the incorporation of the reactive CI electrophile into an analog of CC-1065 (CI-CDPI2) (CDPI, N3-carbamoyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-e]indole-7-carboxylic acid) provided an agent that possesses the characteristic CC-1065 DNA alkylation profile (site selectivity and relative site intensity). These observations suggest that the noncovalent binding selectivity of the agents may restrict the number of available DNA alkylation sites and play a productive role in controlling the sequence-selective alkylation by effectively delivering the electrophile to A + T-rich minor groove regions of DNA possessing accessible adenine N-3 alkylation sites. In turn, the noncovalent binding selectivity may be derived from preferential binding within the narrower, sterically more accessible A + T-rich minor groove of double-stranded DNA.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms of early calcitriol (1 alpha,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) effects, including its receptor activation process as well as its \"nongenomic\" effects, are poorly understood. Calcitriol causes a rapid accumulation of cGMP, dependent on the presence of normal vitamin D receptors (VDRs). We recently developed an immunocytology method based on rapid microwave fixation suitable to detect the locations of agonist-induced intracellular cGMP accumulation. With the same technique we found that calcitriol induces stepwise and rapid reorganization of VDRs. Here we used this technique to study the subcellular compartmentalization of cGMP accumulation after exposure of cells to various steroid-related agonists and to study the spatial relationship between cGMP accumulation and VDRs. Calcitriol (10 nM) within 15 sec caused clumping of VDRs and accumulation of cGMP around VDR clumps; thereafter (up to 5 min), the cGMP accumulation surrounded VDRs throughout their stepwise reorganization. In fibroblasts from subjects with mutations affecting VDR function, we found disruptions of the calcitriol-induced patterns of cGMP accumulation analogous to the disruptions of VDR reorganization. The colocalization of cGMP accumulation with reorganizing VDRs at early moments after calcitriol addition indicates transduction of the cGMP increase by VDRs inside the cell, rather than by components in the plasma membrane. Other steroid-related agonists caused compartmentalized and sequential changes in cGMP accumulation that seemed specific for each class of agonist. Our findings suggest that compartmentalized cGMP accumulation is an early and common step during activation of steroid-related receptors.\r"

Two of these peptides were derived from the amino terminus and four were from the third cytoplasmic loop, including one to the splice variant insertion sequence and one to the carboxyl terminus of the receptor protein. These peptides were conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin prior to rabbit immunization. Antibody production was monitored by a solid-phase ELISA. With the exception of the carboxyl-terminal peptide, all of the peptide immunogens produced antiserum of high titer ranging from 1:10(4) to 1:10(6) on ELISA. Specificity of the reaction was demonstrated by the absence of a response in the preimmune serum and by the absence of cross-reactivity between the various antisera and the nonimmunization peptides. Moreover, preincubation of the antiserum with the immunization peptide, but not other peptides, blocked the subsequent ELISA reactions. Some of the antisera were additionally characterized by immunodot assays using solubilized rat striatal membranes blotted onto nitrocellulose. Positive reactions with antiserum dilutions of 1:500 were observed that were dependent on the presence and concentration of membrane protein and were not observed using preimmune serum. Additionally, immunofluorescent staining by the D2 receptor antiserum was observed on cells that had been transfected with the D2 receptor cDNA but not on untransfected cells. Immunoprecipitation of the photoaffinity-labelled and solubilized D2 receptor also suggested that the antisera were able to directly recognize the native receptor protein. Immunohistochemical localization of the D2 receptor in slices of fresh frozen and perfusion-fixed rat brain was performed using these antisera. Within the striatum, about 50% of the medium-sized neurons were labeled as well as large, putatively cholinergic interneurons.\r"

Antigenic characterization of this variant, designated PNG-1, by immunofluorescence, indicated no expression of gag-encoded proteins p19 and p24 (even after incubation with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine), using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against HTLV-I gag gene products.

Restriction endonuclease maps of PNG-1 proviral DNA differed from that of a prototype strain of HTLV-I (MT-2), but, as verified by polymerase chain reaction, PNG-1 was definitely HTLV-I, not HTLV-II. Nucleotide sequencing and further molecular genetic studies of this variant may provide insights into the origin and evolution of HTLV-I.\r"

The TIBO compounds completely suppress the formation of proviral DNA in acutely infected cells, as revealed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. TIBO derivatives are inhibitory to the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 but not that of HIV-2 or other retroviruses. The inhibition is most effective with poly(C)-oligo(dG) as the template/primer, and it is selectively directed against the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and not the accompanying DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H activity of HIV-1 RT. Kinetic studies point to an uncompetitive inhibition with regard to the template/primer. TIBO compounds are active against HIV-1 replication through a unique interaction with HIV-1 RT. The experimental data indicate the existence of a target on HIV-1 RT that is responsible for the inhibition of replication and a mode of action unrelated to that of previously studied RT inhibitors.\r"

The RK2 origin of DNA transfer (oriT) consists of a 250-base-pair segment including the single-stranded cleavage site (nic) needed to generate the DNA strand believed to be transferred. Deletion derivatives and a bank of hydroxylamine-generated oriT mutants were screened for loss of transferability. DNA regions flanking both sides of nic are required for optimal transfer of the oriT clone. Of the chemically induced mutants, critical base-pair changes that dramatically reduced transfer frequency were found in a 10-base-pair region adjacent to nic. Relaxation (nicking) assays performed with these point mutants using protein-DNA complexes reconstituted in vitro revealed a correlation between DNA nicking and transfer frequency. Base-pair changes within the proximal arm of an inverted repeat upstream from the nick site resulted in reduced binding of the essential transfer protein TraJ and correspondingly reduced transfer frequencies. The results support a model of relaxosome formation involving at least two essential proteins: TraI and TraJ. The nick region defined by the point mutants was located in a segment known to be nearly identical in the related plasmid R751. This sequence was also found to be highly conserved in both border junctions of the transfer DNA (T-DNA) of plant tumor-inducing plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, indicating a relationship between IncP-mediated broad-host-range bacterial conjugation and T-DNA transfer to plants.\r"

  ".W": "Using the \"tagged\" rRNA gene system, which allows in vivo mutational analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae rRNA, we studied the role of two distinct structural elements of 26S rRNA in ribosome biogenesis and function--namely, the evolutionarily highly conserved \"GTPase center\" located in domain II and the eukaroyote-specific variable region V9 in domain III. Replacement of the S. cerevisiae GTPase center with its counterpart from Escherichia coli did not affect the assembly of the mutant 26S rRNA into functional (as judged by their polysomal distribution) 60S subunits, indicating that the E. coli GTPase center functions efficiently in the context of the heterologous rRNA. Removal of most of the S. cerevisiae V9 region or replacement of this segment by the equivalent segment from mouse 28S rRNA also did not affect the formation of functional 60S subunits carrying the mutant 26S rRNA. Therefore, the V9 region does not seem to play a role in the biological functioning of the yeast 60S subunits, and these subunits appear to be able to accommodate V9 regions of various size and secondary structure without apparent loss of function.\r"

The parental line, BAC1.2F5, is dependent on CSF-1 for survival and growth. Of the mutants derived from BAC1.2F5, aut4A has lost the requirement of CSF-1 for survival; aut4A.1 (derived from aut4A) and aut2A grow in the absence of growth factor but proliferate more rapidly in its presence, and aut2A.1 (derived from aut2A) produces CSF-1 and proliferates as rapidly in the presence as in the absence of exogeneous CSF-1. The separation of the CSF-1 requirement for survival and proliferation observed in aut4A is also observed in a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant tsgro1. At the nonpermissive temperature, tsgro1 cell proliferation is arrested, but the cells survive provided CSF-1 is present. The four cellular phenotypes observed--immortalization, loss of growth factor requirement for survival, loss of growth factor requirement for proliferation, and loss of growth factor-stimulated proliferation--indicate a divergence of the pathways of growth factor-regulated survival and proliferation and may represent phenotypes occurring at intermediate stages in tumor-cell progression.\r"

Synthesis of BtuB is repressed when cells are grown in the presence of cobalamins. Mapping of the 5' end of the btuB transcript revealed that a 240-nucleotide transcribed leader precedes the coding sequence. Point mutations causing increased expression under repressing conditions were isolated by use of a btuB-lacZ gene fusion. Mutations at many sites within the leader region affected btuB-lacZ regulation, whereas some base changes upstream of the start of transcription affected the absolute level of expression but not its repressibility. Analysis of btuB-phoA gene fusions and btuB-lacZ operon and gene fusions of various lengths showed that sequences within the btuB coding region (between nucleotides +250 and +350) had to be present for proper expression and transcriptional regulation. Sequences within the leader region (up to +250) conferred regulation of translational fusions. These results indicate that btuB expression is controlled at both the transcriptional and translational levels and that different but possibly overlapping sequences in the transcribed region, including the coding region for the transport protein itself, mediate these two modes of regulation.\r"

Assembly was not observed on RNAs from apoB deletion constructs that did not support editing. The 27S complex contained both edited and unedited RNA sequences. Inhibition of 27S complex assembly by vanadyl-ribonucleoside complexes was accompanied by inhibition of editing. Based on these data, we propose that the 27S complex is the in vitro \"editosome,\" A \"mooring sequence\" model for RNA recognition and editosome assembly has been proposed involving RNA sequences flanking the edited nucleotide.\r"

  ".W": "The neurohypophyseal neuropeptides (Arg8)-vasopressin (AVP) and [pGlu4,Cyt6]AVP-(4-8) (where pGlu is pyroglutamic acid and Cyt is cystine) facilitate the retention of one-trial-learning passive avoidance behavior in rats when administered into the cerebral ventricle immediately after the learning trial. The fragment [pGlu4,Cyt6]AVP-(4-8) was considerably more effective than AVP. Oxytocin (OXT) and [pGlu4,Cyt6]OXT-(4-8) have the opposite effect and attenuate passive avoidance behavior also when administered into the cerebral ventricle after the learning trial. Again the fragment was more active than the parent molecule. The ancient arginine-containing neurohypophyseal hormone vasotocin in \"high\" doses (10ng) had a vasopressin-like effect and in \"low\" doses (0.1 ng) had an OXT-like effect on passive avoidance behavior. Because both vasopressinergic (V1) and oxytocinergic receptors have been demonstrated in the central nervous system, we asked whether specific antagonists of the V1, V2, and OXT receptor could antagonize the effects of these neuropeptides on passive avoidance behavior. The three antagonists were approximately equally active in blocking the effect of vasopressin, whereas the fragment [pGlu4]AVP-(4-8) and the high dose of vasotocin were more readily blocked by the OXT antagonist. The attenuating effect of OXT, the fragment [pGlu4,Cyt6]OXT-(4-8), and the low dose of vasotocin was markedly reduced by the OXT antagonist. This effect could also be reduced by pretreatment with the V1 antagonist but not with the V2 antagonist. These results suggest the existence of a separate neurohypophyseal hormone receptor complex in the brain affecting memory processes that differs from the peripheral V1, V2, and OXT receptor.\r"

  ".W": "9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of retrovirus (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus) replication in vitro and in vivo. Uptake of PMEA by human MT-4 cells and subsequent conversion to the mono- and diphosphorylated metabolites (PMEAp and PMEApp) are dose-dependent and occur proportionally with the initial extracellular PMEA concentrations. Adenylate kinase is unable to phosphorylate PMEA. However, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase directly converts PMEA to PMEApp with a Km of 1.47 mM and a Vmax that is 150-fold lower than the Vmax for AMP. ATPase, 5'-phosphodiesterase, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase are able to dephosphorylate PMEApp to PMEAp, albeit to a much lower extent than the dephosphorylation of ATP. PMEApp has a relatively long intracellular half-life (16-18 hr) and has a much higher affinity for the human immunodeficiency virus-specified reverse transcriptase than for the cellular DNA polymerase alpha (Ki/Km: 0.01 and 0.60, respectively). PMEApp is at least as potent an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase as 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate. Being an alternative substrate to dATP, PMEApp acts as a potent DNA chain terminator, and this may explain its anti-retrovirus activity.\r"

  ".W": "A major part of the present understanding of the molecular basis of signal transduction has been gained from in vitro studies using classical biochemical methods. In this study, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the response of live M2R mouse melanoma cells to stimulation by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH; melanotropin). In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and a synergistic dose of forskolin (1.67 microM), MSH induced a transient (approximately 60-min) rise in the cellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which coincided in time with an equivalent decrease (approximately 40%) in ATP. However, no detectable change in phosphocreatine concentration was observed. Concomitantly, MSH induced a striking and unexpected increase in the concentration of three phosphomonoester (PME) metabolites (approximately 2-fold increase in total PME signal area); one signal has been assigned to phosphoethanolamine. The levels of the PMEs remained high for 2-4 hr and declined slowly (approximately 10 hr) to basal level, following perfusion with fresh culture medium. The increase in PME was also observed after stimulation with MSH alone. In contrast, stimulation with a high dose of forskolin (50 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.2 mM), although effective in stimulating the production of cAMP, did not induce the PME response. Evaluation of the cells' energetics indicated that the enhanced production of phosphoethanolamine is probably not due to ethanolamine phosphorylation. Therefore, it is likely to result from hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine by a specific phospholipase C. The response of the PMEs appears to be regulated by a cAMP-independent process, suggesting the existence of an alternative transduction pathway controlled by MSH.\r"

A phosphoramidate-modified oligonucleotide complementary to TGF beta 3 mRNA was capable of inhibiting normal epithelial-mesenchymal transformation by 80%. Unmodified oligonucleotides to TGF beta 3, modified oligonucleotides to TGF beta 1, -2, and -4, and two modified control oligonucleotides were unable to inhibit the transformation. These data demonstrate that a specific member of the TGF beta family, TGF beta 3, is essential for the epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation.\r"

When Meth A cells (H-2d) were given i.p. to an allogeneic [C57BL/6 (H-2b)] strain of mouse, the tumor cells ceased to grow on the 6th day, accompanied by an i.p. infiltration of leukocytes. The tumor cells were totally eliminated from the peritoneal cavity around the 12th day. The highest cytotoxic activity against Meth A cells was obtained with the peritoneal exudate cells harvested on day 8. On this day, the exudate cells consisted of three populations when examined by flow cytometry, and each was isolated by sorting. Each of them appeared to be homogeneous, and they were morphologically identified as lymphocytes; granulocytes; and medium-sized, mononuclear, less-granular cells. The cytotoxic activity was confined exclusively to the last population. The effector cells (H-2b) were cytotoxic against not only Meth A cells (H-2d) but also concanavalin A-stimulated allogeneic spleen cells [C3H/He (H-2k), CBA/N (H-2k), A/J (H-2a), BALB/c (H-2d), and DBA/2 (H-2d) strains of mouse]. The effector cells were totally inert against concanavalin A-activated syngeneic spleen cells [C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C57BL/10 (H-2b) strains of mouse].

Detailed analysis of this enzyme has been limited, however, by its low abundance and instability. Using oligonucleotides based on primary amino acid sequence derived from purified dCyd kinase, we have screened T-lymphoblast cDNA libraries and identified a cDNA sequence that encodes a 30.5-kDa protein corresponding to the subunit molecular mass of the purified protein. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli results in a 40-fold increase in dCyd kinase activity over control levels. In dCyd kinase-deficient murine L cells, transfection with dCyd kinase cDNA in a mammalian expression vector produces a 400-fold increase over control in dCyd phosphorylating activity. The expressed enzyme has an apparent Km of 1.0 microM for dCyd and is also capable of phosphorylating dAdo and dGuo. Northern blot analysis reveals a single 2.8-kilobase mRNA expressed in T lymphoblasts at 5- to 10-fold higher levels than in B lymphoblasts, and decreased dCyd kinase mRNA levels are present in T-lymphoblast cell lines resistant to arabinofuranosylcytosine and dideoxycytidine. These findings document that this cDNA encodes the T-lymphoblast dCyd kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of dAdo and dGuo as well as dCyd and arabinofuranosylcytosine.\r"

Extremely long runs of charged residues, including some sequences of greater than 20 consecutive charged residues (purely acidic or mixed basic and acidic), occur in about a third of these proteins, whereas equivalent runs are found in less than 3% of other mammalian proteins. The other sequences have less extreme charge clusters, the type and location of which are often conserved between several otherwise nonsimilar antigens. We propose that supercharged surfaces render the targeted host proteins strongly immunogenic and that antinuclear antibody profiles might result from chronic exposure to intracellular contents, possibly in conjunction with crossreactive viral products. The limited number of potential systemic autoantigens may partly be due to the rarity of requisite charge properties.\r"

A few of the brain cells adhering to the D19 monolayers were immunoreactive to the Mac-1 antibody, which labels all cells of the monocytic and granulocytic lineages. The Mac-1-positive cells proliferated vigorously and later most of them acquired the F4/80 epitope specific for macrophages and microglia cells. Studies in clonal conditions allowed development of large colonies of about 2 x 10(5) cells that expressed typical microglia markers. Bone marrow Mac-1-positive cells cocultured on D19 monolayers were also induced to proliferate, whereas peritoneal macrophages were not. D19 astrocytes express macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) activity at a high level, and their conditioned media induced the proliferation of brain and bone marrow Mac-1-positive cells. A specific anti-CSF-1 antiserum completely blocked bone marrow macrophage progenitor proliferation and significantly reduced the multiplication of microglial precursors induced by the D19-conditioned medium. These data indicate that the embryonic and adult mouse brain parenchyma contains potential progenitors for microglial cells.\r"

EBER-deleted recombinants transformed primary B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which were indistinguishable form LCLs transformed by wild-type EBV in their proliferation, in latency-associated EBV gene expression, and in their permissiveness for EBV replication cycle gene expression. EBER-deleted virus from infected LCL clones could infect and growth-transform primary B lymphocytes. These procedures should be applicable to the construction of other EBV recombinants within 40 kilobases of the EBNA-2 gene. The EBER-deleted EBV recombinants should be useful in further evaluating the role of EBERs in EBV infection.\r"

This premelting may correspond to the thermally induced \"unbending\" of the duplex. Specifically, we have used a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to evaluate whether differences in the electrophoretic and hydrogen exchange properties of the bent duplex, [d(GA4T4C)]2, and the normal duplex, [d(GT4A4C)]2, are paralleled by differences in the equilibrium melting properties of these duplexes. Our results reveal that the bimolecular global meltings of both duplexes exhibit two-state behavior and are characterized by the expected thermodynamic changes, as well as the expected salt-dependencies. Significantly, however, at temperatures below duplex melting and over a similar temperature range in which the aberrant electrophoretic mobility is observed (approximately less than 35 degrees C), the bent duplex exhibits calorimetric premelting behavior absent in the normal duplex. Analysis of the calorimetric data in this preglobal melting domain (approximately less than 35 degrees C) allows us to estimate a lower-limit value of 1.6 kcal/(mol-base pair) for the thermally induced unbending of the decameric duplex.\r"

  ".W": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-IV; dipeptidyl-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.14.5) is a serine protease with a specificity for cleaving Xaa-Pro dipeptides from polypeptides and proteins. It is found in a variety of mammalian cells and tissues, including those of lymphoid origin where it is found specifically on the surface of CD4+ T cells. Although the functional significance of this enzyme has not been established, a role in T-cell activation and immune regulation has been proposed. Here we report that Ala-boroPro and Pro-boroPro, where boroPro is the alpha-amino boronic acid analog of proline, are potent and specific inhibitors of DP-IV, having Ki values in the nanomolar range. Blocking the N terminus of Ala-boroPro abolishes the affinity of this inhibitor for DP-IV, while removal of the N-terminal residue, to give boroPro, reduces the affinity for DP-IV by 5 orders of magnitude. The dipeptide boronic acids exhibit slow-binding kinetics, while boroPro does not. We also report here that low concentrations of Pro-boroPro inhibit antigen-induced proliferation and interleukin 2 production in murine T-cell lines but do not inhibit the response of these T cells to the mitogen concanavalin A. These results indicate that DP-IV plays a role in antigen-induced, but not mitogen-induced, activation of T lymphocytes.\r"

The latter, fibril-associated collagens, may facilitate interactions between fibrils and the surrounding extracellular matrix or between fibrils themselves. In an effort to isolate putative nonfibrillar collagens that may have such a function, we screened a 13-day embryonic cornea cDNA library under reduced stringency conditions, using a cDNA probe for a collagenous domain of type XII collagen. We isolated a 4.2-kilobase (kb) cDNA that predicts a \"collagenous\" protein that has three unusual, if not unique, features. (i) The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA has a structural arrangement in which numerous stretches of Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets, typical of collagens, are interrupted by non-Gly-Xaa-Yaa regions. One of the potential triple-helical domains is 246 amino acids long, but most are much smaller, consisting of 15-36 amino acids. Many are very rich in the helix-stabilizing imino acid proline. (ii) Northern blot analyses demonstrated strong cDNA hybridization to a 6.8-kb mRNA whose expression is restricted to the cornea. No hybridization was observed to mRNAs from the nine other tissues used in these analyses, even with extended exposure of the film. (iii) The cDNA contains a short (less than or equal to 425-base-pair) sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the 6.8-kb mRNA that hybridizes to a 7.8-kb mRNA that has a wide tissue distribution.\r"

To study BiP function, we placed the BiP-encoding gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of a regulated promoter and examined the effects of BiP depletion. Reduction of BiP protein to about 15% of normal levels led to a profound reduction in secretion of alpha factor and invertase. At the same time, unglycosylated precursors of these proteins accumulated intracellularly. The predominant form of the invertase precursor had undergone signal sequence cleavage but accumulated as a soluble species in the cytosol. In contrast, the alpha-factor precursor was exclusively in the signal-uncleaved form. It sedimented with microsomal membranes and was exposed at the cytoplasmic face in a protease-resistant form. These findings suggest that, in yeast, BiP function is required for translocation of soluble proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum at a stage beyond the initial nascent chain-membrane association.\r"

Comparisons of cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene sequences provide clear-cut evidence from the mitochondrial genome for the separation of the African ape trichotomy into two evolutionary lineages, one leading to gorillas and the other to humans and chimpanzees. Several different tree-building methods support this same phylogenetic tree topology. The comparisons also yield trees in which a substantial length separates the divergence point of gorillas from that of humans and chimpanzees, suggesting that the lineage most immediately ancestral to humans and chimpanzees may have been in existence for a relatively long time.\r"

Based on epidemiological correlations, the syndrome is thought to be due to a new, sexually or parenterally transmitted retrovirus termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The following epidemiological data conflict with this hypothesis. (i) Noncorrelations exist between HIV and AIDS; for example, the AIDS risks of infected subjects vary greater than 10-fold with their gender or country. Abnormal health risks that are never controlled as independent AIDS causes by AIDS statistics, such as drug addiction and hemophilia, correlate directly with an abnormal incidence of AIDS diseases. Above all, the AIDS diseases occur in all risk groups in the absence of HIV. (ii) American AIDS is incompatible with infectious disease, because it is almost exclusively restricted to males (91%), because if it occurs, then only on average 10 years after transfusion of HIV, because specific AIDS diseases are not transmissible among different risk groups, and because unlike a new infectious disease, AIDS has not spread exponentially since the AIDS test was established and AIDS received its current definition in 1987. (iii) Epidemiological evidence indicates that HIV is a long-established, perinatally transmitted retrovirus. HIV acts as a marker for American AIDS risks, because it is rare and not transmissible by horizontal contacts other than frequent transfusions, intravenous drugs, and repeated or promiscuous sex. It is concluded that American AIDS is not infectious, and suggested that unidentified, mostly noninfectious pathogens cause AIDS.\r"

The microspheres were taken up avidly by the carcinoma cells; confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy showed them to be localized in the cytoplasm, apparently within lysosomes, visualized by labeling with acridine orange. In contrast, fluorescence of unconjugated Ce6 was present within most cellular membranes. Use of Ce6-microsphere conjugates led to a 20-fold-higher mean intracellular concentration, compared with unconjugated Ce6. Cells incubated in the presence of Ce6-microsphere conjugates (0.43 microM equivalent) and subsequently irradiated at 659 nm with a dye laser pumped by an argon-ion laser showed dose-dependent phototoxicity, leading to total inhibition of colony formation at a radiant exposure of 5J/cm2; in contrast, cells incubated with either unconjugated Ce6 (0.43 microM) or unconjugated microspheres before laser irradiation were unaffected. Cells pretreated with Ce6-microsphere conjugates and irradiated in the presence of 90% 2H2O showed significantly increased phototoxicity, an effect consistent with an important role for excited-state singlet oxygen in the mechanism of injury. In solution, however, photosensitized generation of singlet oxygen with Ce6-microsphere conjugates was 9 times less efficient than with unconjugated Ce6. The markedly greater phototoxicity of Ce6-microsphere conjugates compared to unconjugated Ce6 was therefore a consequence of the high intracellular Ce6 concentration attained by phagocytosis of the conjugates and their particular sites of intracellular localization. Thus, these conjugates are an efficient system for the delivery of photosensitizing drugs to carcinoma cells.\r"

Fetal liver hemopoietic cells were infected with a high titer of helper-free Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) and were used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Two weeks later, progenies of a single primitive hemopoietic stem cell carrying a specifically integrated A-MuLV proviral DNA could be detected in both colony-forming units in spleen and myeloid colony-forming cells in the bone marrow. Beginning at 3 weeks after transplantation, the recipients developed elevated leukocyte counts, splenomegaly, and increase of blast cells in the peripheral blood. Multiple clones of A-MuLV-infected cells were infused into each recipient. However, in the same animal, DNA extracted from various affected organs and from factor-independent lymphoid and myeloid immortalized cells all contained an identical, specifically integrated proviral genome. The A-MuLV-infected stem cells differentiated into various lineages of hemopoietic cells. Our data show that the expression of the v-abl oncogene in a primary lymphoid-myeloid hemopoietic stem cell directly initiates leukemogenesis by stimulating factor-independent growth. The monoclonal-type disease development seen in these animals may require the occurrence of an additional genetic event.\r"

Under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, animals were place in a stereotactic frame, and an interstitial microwave antenna operating at 2450 MHz was inserted in a bony groove drilled parallel to the sagittal suture. Some antennae were equipped with an external cooling jacket. Temperature measurements were made lateral to the antenna by fluoroptical thermometry, and power was calculated from the time-temperature profile. Five minutes prior to termination of microwave irradiation, horseradish peroxidase (1 mg/20 g body weight) was injected intravenously. Extravasation of horseradish peroxidase was observed in brain tissue heated above 44.3 degrees C for 30 minutes and at 42.5 degrees C for 60 minutes. Microwave irradiation failed to open the blood-brain barrier when brain temperatures were sustained below 40.3 degrees C by the cooling system. Extravasation of blood-borne peroxidase occurred at sites of maximal temperature elevation, even when these did not coincide with the site of maximum power density. The data suggest that microwave-induced hyperthermia is an effective means for opening the blood-brain barrier and that the mechanism is not related to the nonthermal effect of microwaves.\r"

Midline shift was considered to be out of proportion to intracranial hemorrhage when the midline shift of the septum pellucidum exceeded the extent of the hemorrhage as measured radially from the inner table of the skull. When computed tomography data were analyzed by logistic regression, significant predictive factors for poor outcome were intracranial hemorrhage (34%), intracranial hemorrhage with midline shift (61%), and midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage (88%). When patient outcome and mortality rates are considered, our study indicates that midline shift out of proportion to the extent of intracranial hemorrhage is a highly useful predictor of poor patient outcome following head injury.\r"

Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis of venous invasion is important, as it will alter the surgical approach to the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of visualizing the cerebral venous sinuses. The preoperative diagnosis of venous thrombosis can, however, be difficult and confusing with conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging because of variable appearances produced by blood clot degradation products as well as flowing blood. Phase magnetic resonance imaging is a simple method that can be acquired simultaneously with conventional spin-echo sequences, and is based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving. In the context of venous sinus occlusion, phase imaging can demonstrate the presence or absence of blood flow more easily than spin-echo imaging. Three cases of dural-based neoplasms are presented that demonstrate the utility of phase imaging in diagnosing tumoral occlusion of the venous sinuses.\r"
