Preoperatively, 28 patients (28%) exhibited 105 episodes of ischemia; intraoperatively, 27 patients exhibited 39 episodes and postoperatively, 42 patients exhibited 187 episodes. There was no difference between the pre- and intraoperative episode characteristics. However, postoperative ischemic episodes were the most severe. The mean ST change was 1.5, 2 and 2.6 mm for pre-, intra- and postoperative episodes, respectively (p less than 0.0001 postoperative versus pre- or intraoperative); duration of ischemic episodes was 69, 45 and 207 min, respectively (p less than 0.005 postoperative versus preoperative, p less than 0.001 versus intraoperative) and area under the ST curve was 88, 74 and 383 mm.min (p less than 0.009 postoperative versus preoperative, p less than 0.005 versus intraoperative).

Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes consistent with ischemia were continuously monitored using ambulatory solid state ECG in the 100 patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease. Ischemic episodes were defined as reversible ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm or elevation greater than or equal to 2 mm above the baseline value, with the baseline adjusted for respiratory and positional variation and temporal drift. All ischemic episodes were confirmed by three independent blinded investigators using hard-copy recordings. Total ECG monitoring time was 10,445 h. Twenty-seven patients (27%) developed 437 episodes of ischemia during the 1st week after surgery. The total duration of ischemia was 18,658 min, or 1.8 min of ischemia/h monitored.

In 932 patients with Q wave anterior infarction, the short- and long-term prognostic significance of the presence of right bundle branch block was analyzed. Compared with 754 patients without block, 178 patients with right bundle branch block after myocardial infarction showed an increased incidence of left ventricular failure (72% versus 52%, p less than 0.001) and increased in-hospital (32% versus 8%, p less than 0.001) and 1 year after hospital discharge (17% versus 7%, p less than 0.001) cardiac mortality rates. The presence of right bundle branch block was an independent predictor of increased in-hospital and 1-year mortality when entered in a multivariate analysis. However, the absence of left ventricular failure identified a subgroup of patients with right bundle branch block with low in-hospital (4%) and 1 year postdischarge (5%) cardiac mortality rates comparable with those of patients with neither failure nor right bundle branch block (1.7% and 4.8%, respectively). In the presence of left ventricular failure, patients with associated right bundle branch block had higher in-hospital (43% versus 14%, p less than 0.01) and 1 year postdischarge (24% versus 9%, p less than 0.01) cardiac mortality rates than those of patients with failure but no right bundle branch block. Thus, the presence of right bundle branch block after anterior myocardial infarction is an independent marker of poor prognosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Baseline blood samples were drawn within 24 h after rest pain in patients with unstable angina and in 19 of these 26 patients in less than 6 h. In patients with unstable angina, mean +/- SD (median) values for fibrin D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor values measured 0.09 +/- 0.06 (0.07) microgram/ml and 9.1 +/- 9.6 (5.9) IU, respectively, compared to 0.11 +/- 0.10 (0.05) microgram/ml and 5.5 +/- 1.9 (5.0) IU/ml, in patients in the control group (p = NS for all comparisons between the two groups).

Again, in patients with unstable angina all samples were drawn less than 24 h after rest pain; in six of nine patients samples were drawn in less than 6 h. A coronary sinus to peripheral blood gradient for either of these markers could not be demonstrated. The differences between peripheral and coronary sinus D-dimer and plasminogen activator inhibitor concentrations were also similar in patients with unstable angina and control patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of abruptly produced mitral regurgitation on left ventricular loading and performance was therefore evaluated in five patients who developed this complication after an otherwise successful percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area by Gorlin formula calculated with forward flow increased from 0.92 +/- 0.14 to 2.75 +/- 0.82 cm2. Mean left atrial pressure did not decrease (19 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg). The size of the left atrial V wave relative to mean left atrial pressure (peak V - mean left atrial pressure) increased from 7 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 6 mm Hg. Angiographic mitral regurgitation increased from 0+ or 1+ to greater than 3+ in each patient and regurgitant fraction increased from 0.23 +/- 0.11 to 0.55 +/- 0.09 (p less than 0.01). End-diastolic volume increased modestly from 148 +/- 15 to 159 +/- 15 ml (p = NS).

End-systolic stress decreased by 32% from 277 +/- 34 to 188 +/- 52 kdyn/cm2 (p less than 0.01) as a result of a 25% decrease in end-systolic pressure from 121 +/- 8 to 91 +/- 7 mm Hg and a 16% decrease in end-systolic volume from 67 +/- 13 to 56 +/- 8 ml (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess regional coronary reserve in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, regional myocardial blood flow was measured in 23 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 12 control subjects by means of nitrogen-13 ammonia and dynamic positron emission tomography. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at baseline study, regional myocardial blood flow was 1.14 +/- 0.43 ml/min per g in the hypertrophied (20 +/- 3 mm) interventricular septum and 0.90 +/- 0.35 ml/min per g (p less than 0.05 versus septal flow) in the nonhypertrophied (10 +/- 2 mm) left ventricular free wall. These were not statistically different from the corresponding values in control subjects (1.04 +/- 0.25 and 0.91 +/- 0.21 ml/min per g, respectively, p = NS). After pharmacologically induced coronary vasodilation (dipyridamole, 0.56 mg/kg intravenously over 4 min), regional myocardial blood flow in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy increased significantly less than in control subjects both in the septum (1.63 +/- 0.58 versus 2.99 +/- 1.06 ml/min per g, p less than 0.001) and in the free wall (1.47 +/- 0.58 versus 2.44 +/- 0.82 ml/min per g, p less than 0.001). In addition, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had a history of chest pain had more pronounced impairment of coronary vasodilator reserve than did those without a history of chest pain. After dipyridamole, coronary resistance in the septum decreased by 38% in patients without a history of chest pain, but decreased by only 14% in those with such a history (p less than 0.05). Coronary resistance in the free wall decreased by 45% in patients without and by 27% in those with a history of chest pain (p = 0.06).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91154598\r", 
  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that the combined use of the time-varying elastance concept and conventional circumferential stress-shortening relations would elucidate differential mechanisms for left ventricular systolic dysfunction in severe, chronic aortic regurgitation and therefore predict the functional responses to aortic valve replacement, 31 control patients and 37 patients with aortic regurgitation were studied. The studies included micromanometer left ventricular pressure determinations, biplane contrast cineangiograms under control conditions and radionuclide angiograms under control conditions and during methoxamine or nitroprusside infusions with right atrial pacing. The patients with aortic regurgitation were classified into three groups: Group I had normal Emax and stress-shortening relations, Group II had abnormal Emax but normal stress-shortening relations and Group III had abnormal Emax and stress-shortening relations. The left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes showed a progressive increase and the ejection fraction showed a progressive decrease from Group I to III; these values differed from those in the control patients (p less than 0.001). In Group I, there was a decrease in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in ejection fraction (61 +/- 7% versus 63 +/- 4%) after aortic valve replacement. In contrast, in Group II, reduction in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.01) was associated with an increase in ejection fraction from 50 +/- 8% to 64 +/- 11% (p less than 0.01). Finally, in Group III, reduction in left ventricular volumes (p less than 0.05) was associated with a further decrement in ejection fraction from 35 +/- 13% to 30 +/- 13%. Group I patients had compensated adequately for chronic volume overload. However, Group II had left ventricular dysfunction that was associated with an increase in the left ventricular volume/mass ratio compared with that in the control patients and Group I (p less than 0.05 for both), suggesting inadequate hypertrophy and assumption of spherical geometry. Finally, irreversible myocardial dysfunction had supervened in Group III. In conclusion, a combined analysis of left ventricular chamber performance using the time-varying elastance concept and myocardial performance using conventional circumferential stress-shortening relations provides complementary information that elucidates differential mechanisms for left ventricular systolic dysfunction and therefore predicts the functional response to aortic valve replacement.\r"

  ".U": "91154600\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate the influence of orifice geometry on the three-dimensional shape of jets, an in vitro Doppler color flow study was performed. Jets were formed by discharging blood through round orifices and through orifices with major/minor axis ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1. These were repeated with orifice areas of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 cm2. For turbulent and laminar jets formed by these orifices, Doppler color flow images were obtained from two orthogonal scanning planes aligned with the major and minor orifice axes. Jet width was measured at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm from the orifice and used to calculate jet eccentricity (ratio of major to minor axis widths) and the rate of divergence of the jet walls. Jets were observed to diverge more rapidly along walls aligned with the orifice minor axis rather than along the major axis. This differential spreading led to the development of circular symmetry at a short distance from the orifice. Jet divergence (theta) occurred more rapidly for turbulent jets and for jets formed by larger orifices: theta (zero) = 0.80 + 6.3.A + 7.0.T + 0.47.E-OR (r = 95, p less than 0.0001, n = 48), where A is orifice area (cm2); T is 0 for laminar jets, 1 for turbulent jets and E-OR combines orifice eccentricity and scanning orientation, ranging from -5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the major axis, 0 for circular orifices to 5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the minor axis. Within the jet, eccentricity decayed approximately exponentially with distance from the orifice, more rapidly for turbulent jets, more slowly for the larger and more eccentric orifices.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The corrected QT interval and ventricular effective refractory period measured at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms were significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (QT interval 428 +/- 52 versus 460 +/- 59 ms; ventricular effective refractory period 237 +/- 28 versus 254 +/- 24 ms; (p less than 0.05). In addition, the interelectrogram coupling interval of the ventricular extrastimulus initiating ventricular tachycardia was significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (223 +/- 37 versus 251 +/- 33 ms; p = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis identified a short ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval (p less than 0.01) and absence of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) as the only independent predictors of antiarrhythmic drug suppression of the induction of ventricular tachycardia. Greater drug-induced increments in the ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were observed in responders than in nonresponders as was the shortest ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval. Thus, baseline electrophysiologic measurements identify patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who are likely to respond to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Furthermore, these patients demonstrate greater drug-induced electrophysiologic changes.\r"

Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02). The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04). The frequency of increased heart weight (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups. The severity of the prolapse (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups. Thus, persons with mitral valve prolapse dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without mitral regurgitation.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomic findings in 11 cases of tricuspid atresia and in two cases of severe tricuspid stenosis, both combined with partial common atrioventricular (AV) canal, are presented in detail. Twelve cases were documented by postmortem examination and the diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiography and surgical observation in the one living patient. Clinical data available in nine cases and cardiac catheterization data obtained in eight are included in this report. In three cases (23%)--two with tricuspid atresia and one with extreme tricuspid stenosis--the tricuspid valve and right ventricle exhibited characteristics seen in Ebstein's anomaly. In all 13 cases, the great arteries were normally related. The ventricular septal defect(s) in 10 (83%) of the 12 postmortem cases rapidly became smaller and this resulted in marked diminution of the pulmonary blood flow and severe hypoxia. Only three of the eight patients with available cardiac catheterization and angiocardiographic data showed the scooped-out appearance of the left ventricular septal surface characteristic of AV canal defects. By contrast, two-dimensional echocardiography, available in the three most recent cases, accurately demonstrated all the defects present and represents the diagnostic method of choice. Early surgical intervention to establish a systemic to pulmonary artery anastomosis is essential for survival. More definitive surgical treatment can be achieved later by an atriopulmonary or cavopulmonary anastomosis with or without replacement of the cleft and often regurgitant mitral valve. The one living patient exemplifies this approach. This is the largest series of this unusual type of tricuspid atresia reported to date.\r"

  ".U": "91154605\r", 
  ".W": "In 450 cases of structural heart disease diagnosed prenatally, 38 fetuses (8.5%) had either a dysplastic or a displaced tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve was dysplastic in 22 fetuses, all of which had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation resulting in right atrial dilation and increased cardiothoracic ratio. An associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve occurred in 16 fetuses. The remaining 16 fetuses had Ebstein's malformation, 14 with evidence of tricuspid incompetence at presentation and 10 with an associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve. Of the 38 cases, the pregnancy was interrupted in 17, spontaneous intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8, 11 infants died postnatally and 2 infants are still alive; additional abnormalities were found in 8 cases (chromosomal anomalies in 2, ventricular septal defects in 2, corrected transposition in 2, the Chiari malformation in 2, supraventricular tachycardia in 1 case and coarctation of the aorta in 1). Fetuses with severe abnormalities are selected for fetal echocardiography by the four chamber screening program and a high rate of natural loss both in intrauterine life and immediately after birth was observed in the 21 cases in which pregnancy was continued. This would explain the higher incidence of tricuspid valve disease in our prenatal compared with postnatal series. Although increased cardiothoracic ratio and associated lesions of the right ventricular outflow tract contribute to the poor outcome in the cases detected prenatally, the absence of these features does not always indicate a good prognosis because progression of disease can occur with advancing gestational age. No absolute measurement or single echocardiographic feature emerged as a consistent predictive factor of prognosis.\r"

The presenting feature was a systolic and diastolic murmur in all, one of whom developed heart failure within 2 weeks of presentation. In the first two patients, the echocardiographic findings were inconclusive and the diagnosis was confirmed at cardiac catheterization (at 10 and 23 months of age, respectively); the other two were diagnosed echocardiographically by two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging. All four patients underwent surgery by patch closure of the aortic end of the tunnel (three patients) or direct suture closure (one patient) and there were no deaths. The mean age at operation was 11 months. During a mean follow-up period of 71 months (range 2 to 157), three patients have clinical and echocardiographic evidence of trivial aortic valve regurgitation, which was noted in the immediate postoperative period in one and at early (less than 6 months) follow-up study in the other two. All are symptom-free, are taking no medications and are growing and developing normally. Aortico-left ventricular tunnel can be accurately diagnosed by echocardiography. In patients presenting in infancy, echocardiography also provides the necessary morphologic information to enable surgical correction without angiography. Early operation is associated with an excellent outcome, whereas repair at a later age is associated with a high incidence of residual aortic regurgitation requiring further surgery.\r"

Both atenolol and nifedipine were effective (p less than 0.005) in reducing the average number and duration of transient ischemic events, but therapy with atenolol was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the mean number (p less than 0.05) and duration (p less than 0.01) of silent ischemic events. Analyses of the silent ischemic activity during the morning hours revealed that only therapy with atenolol produced a significant reduction in the average duration per patient (139 +/- 54 vs. 1,609 +/- 468 s, p less than 0.01) and in the average duration of silent ischemia per event between 6 AM and 12 noon (62 +/- 21 vs. 208 +/- 24 s, p less than 0.005). There were fewer adverse experiences during therapy with atenolol. These results show that although both atenolol and nifedipine are effective in reducing silent ischemic events, treatment with atenolol is associated with significantly greater efficacy, particularly on the morning surge of silent myocardial ischemia.\r"

Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years. Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12). At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry. Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation. At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients. One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge. At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium. One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor. Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient. Over a total follow-up of 191 patient months (mean 21 +/- 20), seven patients remained free of atrial fibrillation. Two patients had recurrent atrial fibrillation, which in one patient was effectively controlled by a single antiarrhythmic agent. A permanent pacemaker was implanted in four patients for sinus node dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The type of laser most suitable to achieve these goals remains unknown. Accordingly, angiographic and histologic studies and quantitative platelet deposition analysis were performed on 27 atherosclerotic rabbit iliac arteries randomized to treatment with excimer laser or thermal laser angioplasty. Excimer laser angioplasty was achieved with 35 to 40 mJ/mm2 of 308 nm xenon chloride irradiation delivered through a 4.5F catheter made of 13 concentrically arranged 200 microns fiber optics, at a repetition rate of 25 to 30 Hz and a pulse duration of 135 ns; thermal laser angioplasty was achieved with a 1.7 mm metal probe heated with 10 W of continuous wave argon laser energy. The baseline and post-laser luminal diameters of excimer laser-treated vessels (0.92 +/- 0.28 and 1.56 +/- 0.48 mm, respectively) were similar to those observed in thermal laser-treated vessels (1.05 +/- 0.44 and 1.61 +/- 0.41 mm, respectively). Perforation occurred in 4 (29%) of 14 thermal laser-treated arteries and in 0 of 13 excimer laser-treated arteries (p = 0.04); spasm was observed in only 1 thermal laser-treated vessel. On the basis of a quantitative histologic grading scheme (damage scores of 0 to 4), greater degrees of injury were measured in thermal versus excimer laser-treated vessels (2.4 +/- 1.0 versus 1.3 +/- 0.4, p = 0.009).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although limitations of electrogram analysis exist and are discussed, careful analysis and registration of electrograms during all supraventricular and ventricular rhythms observed during in-hospital testing served as an important reference for subsequent arrhythmia diagnosis. By analyzing the electrogram rate and RR interval stability and configuration, a definitive diagnosis was established in all three patients (atrial fibrillation, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and rate-sensing lead disruption, respectively). Thus, the ability to store ventricular electrograms before shock therapy represents a major advance in the management of patients who receive an electrical device to treat ventricular tachyarrhythmia.\r"

The lesion was reduced to a 30% residual stenosis with use of a 1.2 mm and subsequently a 1.8 mm diameter laser catheter. Early follow-up angiography 24 h later revealed persistent patency and unchanged lesion diameter of the target vessel. The patient was free of symptoms during the 2 month follow-up period, but died suddenly while playing in a tennis tournament 63 days after the procedure. Postmortem histologic examination revealed 80% restenosis at the lesion site without plaque disruption or thrombosis. Specific staining of the histologic specimen for smooth muscle cells using alpha-actin revealed significant smooth muscle cell proliferation at the site of coronary excimer laser angioplasty. However, most of the vessel narrowing appeared to be due to underlying fibrotic plaque as a result of insufficient tissue ablation. This was probably related to the size of the currently available catheters, which are too small to create a large channel.\r"

Favourable contemporary reviews showed international approval. The rational basis of treatment was emphasised, but there was little systematic evaluation of outcome. Current enthusiasm for functional endoscopic sinus surgery is also based on a rational approach, logical deductions from pathophysiological 'facts'. Outcome has still not been evaluated scientifically. We should learn from history. Treatment should not be based too readily on what seems to be rational now. Ideas of physiology and pathology change. What seems logical today may appear ridiculous tomorrow. Careful analysis of outcome, preferably by controlled clinical trials, is needed as a rational treatment requires empirical validation just as much as any other.\r"

This approach to the management of posterior epistaxis is effective and reduces the duration of hospital stay. It significantly reduces the discomfort to the patient.

This report represents the preliminary findings using this particular technique in the management of an intracanalicular acoustic tumour.\r"

The rationale is that the melanin content of the inner ears is related to that of the eyes; dark eyes contain more melanin than light-coloured eyes; and melanin causes the accumulation of the ototoxic drug within the inner ear. Hence those with dark eyes will suffer greater damage to the hearing than those with pale eyes. An investigation that confirmed this hypothesis is reported. In addition to cochlear damage there is a significant likelihood of damage to the auditory nerve as a result of the treatment.\r"

An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset.\r"

Twenty five patients had attacks accompanied by headache, and seven gave a history of common migraine. Only four of 27 angiograms were abnormal; no operable carotid lesion was demonstrated. Over a mean follow up period of 10 years stroke or myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in all four patients who presented major cerebrovascular risk factors, but in only two of the remaining 42 patients. Thus irrespective of age thromboembolic TIA is a harbinger of stroke or AMI. However, most TIAs under the age of 40 years are caused by a non-embolic benign vascular disorder. The clinical characteristics, long-term prognosis, and possible pathogenesis, for such attacks are often indistinguishable from those of classical migraine. In the absence of cardiovascular risk factors, arteriography does not provide much diagnostic and prognostic information.\r"

All the patients with STP and two of those with ITN had trigeminal reflex abnormalities; 80% of patients with STP and 30% of those with ITN had evoked potential abnormalities. The results indicate that 1) trigeminal reflexes and evoked potentials are both useful in the examination of patients with trigeminal pain, and in cases secondary to specific pathologies provide 100% sensitivity; 2) in \"symptomatic\" and \"idiopathic\" paroxysmal pain the primary lesion affects the afferent fibres in the proximal portion of the root or the intrinsic portion in the pons; 3) primary sensory neurons of the A-beta fibre group are involved in both paroxysmal and constant pain, but in the latter the damage is far more severe.\r"

Twenty patients who had exhibited a 50% or more reduction in frequency of one or more seizure types entered an eight week double-blind placebo controlled phase. Patients on vigabatrin maintained a 54.7% reduction of seizure frequency, whereas those on placebo showed an 18.6% increase in seizure frequency, a highly significant difference between the two groups. In the open phase, seven patients were withdrawn due to unacceptable and reversible adverse events. The commonest side effects were drowsiness, depression and mood instability, and headaches. Vigabatrin is a potentially valuable new treatment for chronic epilepsy, especially partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation.\r"

In both groups of patients electrophysiological signs of polyneuropathy of the axonal type were present in the sural, median and peroneal nerves. The AIDS patients had a greater reduction of the mean (SD) sural nerve action potential, 3.1 (2.7) microV, than in patients without AIDS, 10.2 (6.1) microV (p less than 0.01) and greater slowing of peroneal nerve conduction velocity, 42.6 (1.4) m/s in AIDS patients versus 52.6 (3.3) m/s in patients without AIDS (p less than 0.0001). These findings indicate that in most HIV infected patients the severity but not the type of neuropathy depends on whether an immune deficient state has developed. Seven patients with symptomatic polyneuropathy were treated with azidothymidine (AZT) for an average of 10 months and compared with a group of five untreated patients with similar symptoms. No effect of AZT treatment on sural or median nerve amplitude or conduction velocity or on the vibratory or temperature thresholds was observed.\r"

  ".W": "We developed and tested a simple three-point scale for grading white matter lesions in anterior and posterior regions of the brain. Twenty four CT scans and 24 MRI scans were separately judged by 11 and five observers, respectively, on the presence and severity of white matter lesions. The observers were radiologists and neurologists. For CT scans, these periventricular changes were graded according to their extent as absent, or partly involving the white matter, or extending up to the subcortical region. The MRI lesions were graded as no lesion or only a single one, multiple focal lesions, and multiple confluent lesions. The pairwise agreements of all possible combinations of observers for each scan were corrected for chance (kappa statistics; maximal agreement 1.0). The weighted kappa value, for anterior and posterior regions combined, was 0.63 for CT scans, and 0.78 for MRI scans. This three-point scale for two separate regions seems suitable as a basis for cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of large series of patients.\r"

The DAT patients were significantly more impaired on measures of delayed verbal and figural episodic memory, and in addition showed a more rapid rate of decline on tests which depend upon the integrity of semantic knowledge (naming, number information, similarities and category fluency). In contrast, the HD patients were significantly worse, and showed a more rapid decline on the letter fluency test, a task especially sensitive to deficiencies in retrieval. The HD patients were also more impaired than DAT patients on a vocabulary test and on copying geometric figures. The observed double dissociations offer compelling evidence that aetiologically distinct forms of dementing illness result in different patterns of cognitive impairment.\r"

The male subjects were simultaneously being examined for an epidemiologic study of heart disease. Baseline data collected from both the men and women at a previous heart disease examination were used to compare responders vs nonresponders. The target population for the osteoporosis study consisted of 1685 men and 1594 women. Of these, 1379 men (81.8%) and 1105 women (72.0%) participated in the initial osteoporosis examination. For each sex, nonrespondents were older and had higher systolic blood pressure levels than did the respondents. Male nonresponders had a higher stroke prevalence and more frequent recent use of vasodilator medicine. Female nonresponders had a less frequent history of having ever taken female hormones than did the responders. The responders and nonresponders were reasonably similar in other respects, as indicated by the comparison of more than 40 other variables. This suggests that nonresponse bias is probably not a major influence in exposure-disease associations in this osteoporosis cohort. We believe this is the first published report dealing with nonresponse characteristics in a cohort study of osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "Often a \"disease\" or \"state of disease\" is defined by a subdomain of a continuous outcome variable. For example, the subdomain of diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg has been used to define hypertension. The classical method of estimating the risk (or prevalence) of such defined disease states is to dichotomize the outcome variable according to the cutoff value. The standard statistical analysis of such risk of disease then exploits methods developed specifically for binary data, usually based on the binomial distribution. We present a method, based on the assumption of a Gaussian (normal) distribution for the continuous outcome, which does not resort to dichotomization. Specifically, the estimation of risk and its variance is presented for the one- and two-sample situations, with the latter focusing on risk differences and ratios, and odds ratios. The binomial approach applied to the dichotomized data is found to be less efficient than the proposed method by 67% or less. The latter is found to be very accurate, even for small sample sizes, although rather sensitive to substitutions of the underlying distribution by thicker tailed distributions. Canadian total cholesterol data are used to illustrate the problem. For the one-sample case, the approach is illustrated using data from a study of the arterial oxygenation of 20 patients during one-lung anesthesia for thoracic surgery. For the two-sample case, data from a prognostic study of the renal function of 87 lupus nephritic patients are used.\r"

The register is designed for longitudinal comparisons of annual AMI risk (incidence, attack rate, death rate), and the risk to the AMI patients themselves (28-day case fatality). The methodology and specific issues encountered during registration and data evaluation are described. With an estimated 95% completeness of case finding, the quality control data review which the register conducts annually shows a consistency of specific data structures which indicate stable case finding and validation procedures. However, local conditions which affect case finding and data completeness per case are responsible for the creation of subsets of AMI which are in turn distinguished by differences in diagnostic category structures. With regard to the study objectives, the differences among subsets appear to have the least effect on rate calculations if DEFINITE and POSSIBLE AMI are combined. The implications of methodological variations and subset differences within and across registers on annual rate calculations and result comparisons are discussed.\r"

Data from a real fixed sample trial have been used, both for resampling from the original data, and for construction of an idealized theoretical distribution. The sequential and the fixed sample test obtain equal power, but the sequential test mostly includes considerably fewer patients to reach a conclusion, i.e. the mean and median number of patients included are both much lower than the fixed sample size. Under the hypotheses only a small fraction of the simulation runs exceed the fixed sample size. These findings exemplify results obtained in theoretical analyses and simulation studies covering a wide range of distributions. In our opinion sequential tests have obvious advantages and are in many cases better alternatives than fixed sample tests in clinical trials.\r"

The experimental group (n = 137) received a supplemental dose of 10 mg of beta-carotene daily for 3 months. The control group (n = 141) received placebo capsules. As the outcome parameter, two definitions of regression and progression were used, which were based on the degree of dysplasia before and after the medication period. The number of patients who showed progression was too small to allow conclusions. No effect of beta-carotene on the regression percentages was observed: OR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.28-1.60) using the broad definition; and OR = 1.22 (95% CI: 0.43-3.41) with the strict definition. A secondary analysis, in which the effect of the total intake of beta-carotene (diet + medication) on the regression percentages of cervical dysplasia was studied, did not show a positive effect either. The paper discusses to what extent issues in the study design may have masked a potential effect and how our results affect the evidence for a causal relation between beta-carotene and cancer.\r"

Using a computer, these categories were grouped into 2-12 stages in every possible combination, so a total of 146,975 logical classifications were generated. The optimal model was selected for each group of classifications with equal stage number, thus giving the greatest prognostic information on 5-year survival according to the Akaike criterion. The results showed that (1) 13% of the total classifications, including 85% of the 3-stage classifications, were better than the Dukes system in predicting our patients' outcomes; (2) the T-level was a stage-determinant even more important than the N-level; and (3) major changes in prognosis occurred at more advanced stages than the classical \"turning points\". We conclude that in order to find an optimal staging of cancer, systematic computer-aided search through all the possible classifications is necessary, using the appropriate database.\r"

  ".W": "Among the 4129 patients of the Community Hospital-based Stroke Program, 30% had an unspecified stroke diagnosis. Since specific diagnosis and, perhaps, eventual treatment, derives in part from diagnostic testing, we examined the effect of clinical condition, geographic and demographic factors on the incidence of certain diagnostic tests after acute stroke. In this multivariable analysis, race, sex, history of hypertension and history of diabetes did not influence the chance of having any test, but older age strongly reduced the chances of receiving extensive evaluation. When CT scanning was available, the utilization of a CT as well as other diagnostic studies including cerebral angiography, radionuclide brain scan, EEG and EKG was increased. The odds of receiving a CT scan increased if the patient was married, and decreased with a history of previous stroke. A history of previous TIA increased the chance of having a cerebral angiogram while a history of cardiac disease decreased the chance. There were striking regional geographic differences in the use of CT, radionuclide brain scanning and cerebral angiography which may, in part, reflect differences between the availability of these technologies in urban and rural hospitals. These results indicate that evaluation of stroke patients remains heterogenous.\r"

The consumption rate among women was about three times as high as that for men. The use of psychotropic drugs increased with age. No consistent pattern was found with respect to social class. According to psychiatric/physical health status the highest consumption rate (29.4%) was found among those suffering solely from psychiatric disorders. The simultaneous occurrence of both psychiatric and physical disorder did not increase the risk of drug taking (21.4%). Less than 5% of the healthy respondents and of those suffering solely from a physical disorder used psychotropic drugs. A large proportion (63.0%) of those with previous psychiatric in- and outpatient treatment received psychotropic medication, as well as those suffering from schizophrenia (66.7%), affective psychoses (52.6%) and anxiety disorders (50.0%). The higher consumption of psychotropic drugs among women could not be explained by higher psychiatric or physical morbidity or the fact that women consult primary care physicians more frequently than do men. Controlling for co-morbidity and annual consultation of family physicians, significant sex differences in the consumption of psychotropic drugs persist.\r"

Our medical costs averaged $369.72 per inpatient day and $150.24 per outpatient day (saving $219.48 per diem, 1988 Canadian dollars), while narcotic costs were the same for any given patient in both settings. Sensitivity analysis showed that no reasonable changes in the quantity and cost of services reduced our savings by more than 50%. During incremental analysis, savings increased as more outpatient days were managed by our centre, from $0.00 for 318 days, to more than $500,000 for over 2000 days per annum. As this program has been extremely cost effective and preferred by our patients, other hospitals and central funding agencies might consider establishing a regional outpatient narcotic infusion program to reduce their costs.\r"

The 399 women who reported the new onset of diabetes had a significantly greater mean body mass index (kg/m2) and WHR than non-cases. After adjustment for body mass index (BMI), age and education level using multivariate logistic regression, WHR was a significant independent predictor of diabetes in a dose-response fashion. Cases were 4.6 times (95% CI = 3.8, 5.6) more likely than non-cases to be in the upper tertile of WHR and 2.2 times (95% CI = 1.8, 2.7) more likely to be in the middle tertile. Women in the highest tertiles of both WHR and BMI had a 14.4-fold (95% CI = 9.5, 21.9) higher risk of diabetes than women in the lowest tertiles. These results demonstrate that increased abdominal adiposity is a significant independent risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus in older women.\r"

  ".W": "Perforation of the vena cava or atrium is a serious complication of monitoring with a central venous catheter. We designed an in vitro model with a pulsating simulated membrane to evaluate a number of variables that could affect relative perforating potential of different types of central venous catheters. To determine the perforating potential of central venous catheters, we studied the effects of (1) the angle of incidence (n = 6) between catheter and simulated membrane; (2) catheter material (polyurethane and polyethylene); (3) make (manufacturer and model) (n = 6), with 3 catheters of each make tested; (4) design (n = 3 each: silicone rubber, open-ended, blunt-ended, and polyurethane pigtail); and (5) number of lumens (single, double, or triple). Each trial was repeated five times with each catheter that was tested. Perforation was significantly more likely when the angle of incidence between catheter and pulsating simulated membrane was greater than 40 degrees than when it was 40 degrees (P less than 0.05). Perforation was less likely with single-lumen than comparable French-sized double- and triple-lumen catheters; among single-lumen catheters, perforation required many more pulsations with a polyurethane than a polyethylene catheter (P less than 0.001). Perforation potential differed significantly among 6 makes of 7-French triple-lumen catheters (P less than 0.05). Compared with other materials or designs, silicone rubber or a pigtail tip decreased the perforation potential of catheters (P less than 0.001). These data offer additional objective information to consider when choosing and positioning central venous catheters.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the accuracies of two types of noninvasive blood pressure devices. Thirty-two patients requiring an intraarterial catheter for anesthetic management underwent simultaneous monitoring with Dinamap 1846SX and Ohmeda Finapres 3700 devices. For the first 10 minutes of recording, new Dinamap determinations were performed every 60 seconds; subsequent recordings were made at 3-minute intervals. Data were obtained at the time of new Dinamap readings, and twice between new readings to approximate the real-time performance of the two monitors. We defined superior accuracy as a statistically significant difference in mean absolute error greater than 5 mm Hg. With these criteria, pooled data from all patients revealed no difference in performance, even in real time. Pooled data can be misleading since there was a significant amount of variation in accuracy for both monitors. Therefore, we used nonparametric analysis to determine how many individual patients were monitored better by either device. When we compared only data from new Dinamap readings, the Finapres monitor showed superior performance for systolic readings in 13 patients, versus 6 patients for the Dinamap (P less than 0.05, chi-square test). Similar analysis for diastolic and mean pressure performance did not reach statistical significance. However, in real time, the Finapres unit monitored more patients more accurately for systolic (14 Finapres versus 3 Dinamap), diastolic (11 Finapres versus 3 Dinamap), and mean (10 Finapres versus 3 Dinamap) pressure determinations. The magnitude of these differences were, however, less dramatic than expected. This was probably due to stabilization of arterial pressure during the anesthetic, which minimized the error due to intermittent sampling. We conclude that continuous Finapres readings and new Dinamap determinations are equally accurate for diastolic and mean arterial pressures. The accuracy of Finapres appears to be slightly superior for systolic pressure. The intermittent sampling of oscillometric devices compromises their performance relative to the Finapres in many, but not all, cases.\r"

  ".W": "Seven patients undergoing isoflurane anesthesia were studied using electroencephalographic (EEG) mapping, a computer-assisted technique of EEG processing that permits the analysis of the spatial distribution of frequency components of the human EEG. After induction with thiopental, the patients were hyperventilated (carbon dioxide tension, 25 to 28 mm Hg) with 4% isoflurane in oxygen until a burst-suppression EEG appeared. Brain electrical activity was compared before anesthesia, at 0.5 to 0.8% and 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane, during bursts, and after anesthesia. Starting from an alpha EEG with occipital predominance, a distinct alpha activation appeared over the whole cortex during 0.5 to 0.8% isoflurane. Decreased alpha amplitude with a maximum over the frontotemporal regions was observed during 1.8 to 2.1% isoflurane. Bursts consisted of high amplitude in all frequency bands. In the delta and the theta bands, voltage was very low before isoflurane administration, and increased in relation to depth of anesthesia. A minimum in delta and theta amplitudes occurred over both central regions. The dominant frequency, defined as the frequency component with the highest amplitude in the frequency spectrum, decreased from 8 to 4 and finally to 1 Hz, while its amplitude increased from 3 to 13 microV. As anesthesia deepened, the dominant frequency shifted from the occiput to the frontal cortex. Brain mapping transfers an immense amount of electroencephalographic (EEG) data into a comprehensive, easily readable image of brain function during anesthesia for therapy of mental depression. To make use of this technique in the operating room, further investigation and development toward on-line mapping are necessary.\r"

A special optical reflectance sensor that includes a heating element was interfaced to a temperature controller and a commercial Data-scope ACCUSAT pulse oximeter that was adapted for this study to perform as a reflectance pulse oximeter. The reflectance pulse oximeter sensor was evaluated in a group of 10 healthy adult volunteers during steady-state hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by gradually lowering the inspired fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas mixture from 100 to 12%. Simultaneous SaO2 measurements obtained from the forearm and calf with two identical reflectance pulse oximeters were compared with SaO2 values measured by a finger sensor that was interfaced to a standard Datascope ACCUSAT transmittance pulse oximeter. The equations for the best-fitted linear regression lines between the percent reflectance, SpO2(r), and transmittance, SpO2(t), values in the range between 73 and 100% were SpO2(r) = -7.06 + 1.09 SpO2(t) for the forearm (n = 91, r = 0.95) and SpO2(r) = 7.78 + 0.93 SpO2(t) for the calf (n = 93, r = 0.88). The regression analysis of the forearm data revealed a mean +/- SD error of 2.47 +/- 1.66% (SaO2 = 90-100%), 2.35 +/- 2.45% (SaO2 = 80-89%), and 2.42 +/- 1.20% (SaO2 = 70-79%). The corresponding regression analysis of the calf data revealed a mean +/- SD error of 3.36 +/- 3.06% (SaO2 = 90-100%), 3.45 +/- 4.12% (SaO2 = 80-89%), and 2.97 +/- 2.75% (SaO2 = 70-79%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They were randomized to receive MTX 200 mg/m2, followed by 5-FU 600 mg/m2 either 24 hours (arm A) or 1 hour (arm B) after MTX. All patients received leucovorin (LV) 24 hours after MTX, 10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses. The regimen was repeated every 2 weeks, with 5-FU escalation as tolerated. Arm A was significantly better than arm B with respect to overall response rate (29% v 14.5%, P = .026), time to progression (TTP; median, 9.9 months v 5.9 months, P = .009), and survival (median, 15.3 months v 11.4 months, P = .003). Significant differences between arms were not found in response rate, median TTP, or median survival for the subgroup of patients with rectal primaries who comprised 20% of the patients in each arm. Significant factors prognostic for survival were performance status and number of metastases, as well as treatment. Age did not influence survival. Toxicity was similar in both arms and was primarily gastrointestinal. More mucositis was seen in arm A. There were four toxic deaths secondary to neutropenia and infection (one from arm A and three from arm B) and three other deaths (two from arm A and one from arm B) that were possibly drug-related. The combination of MTX with LV rescue and 5-FU is an active regimen in advanced colorectal cancer; its efficacy is increased in colon, but not rectal cancer, when the interval between MTX and 5-FU is long (24 hours) rather than short (1 hour).\r"

A number of generally accepted prognostic factors, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (P = .003), residual tumor mass (P less than .001), and grade (P = .011), were also of prognostic importance in our patient population. Multivariate analysis, based on the Cox regression model, identified clonogenic growth as a significant independent prognostic parameter in ovarian carcinoma (P = .031), in addition to the conventional risk factors. Estimation of survival of individual patients was best accomplished by combining the factors of residual tumor mass (P less than .05), age (P less than .01), and clonogenic growth (P less than .05) (in sequence of decreasing potential of risk).\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to critically define the incidence and clinical characteristics of secondary responses to cisplatin-based therapy in patients with ovarian cancer previously treated with a cisplatin-based program, a retrospective review was undertaken of patients at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who received greater than or equal to two cisplatin/carboplatin-based programs. Eighty-two patients were identified who met the entry criteria of having had a cisplatin-free interval (CFI) of more than 4 months between the completion of their first regimen and the institution of a second cisplatin/carboplatin program. Of the 72 assessable patients (10 had no measurable disease, and a laparotomy was not performed to assess response), 31 (43%) responded, including 10 surgically defined complete responses (S-CRs). The overall response rates (and S-CR rate), based on duration of CFI, were 5 to 12 months, 27% (5%); 13 to 24 months, 33% (11%); and more than 24 months, 59% (22%). Twenty-nine patients (35%) received noncisplatin/carboplatin-containing treatments between the cisplatin programs. Patients without any treatment for more than 24 months from the completion of their initial therapy experienced a 77% (17 of 22) response rate and a 32% (seven of 22) S-CR rate. In conclusion, secondary responses to cisplatin/carboplatin-based treatment are common in patients with ovarian cancer who have previously responded to the agents and increase in frequency with greater distance from the initial therapy.\r"

  ".W": "As the number of long-term survivors of childhood leukemia increases, growth retardation has emerged as a significant complication. Treatment of these children with growth hormone (GH) has been suggested and sporadically implemented. We, therefore, studied the effect of human GH (hGH) and its by-product insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the growth of leukemic cells in vitro. Under serum-free conditions hGH and IGF-1 induced a significant dose-dependent proliferative effect on promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Daudi) cell lines. Anti-hGH antibodies negated the stimulatory effect of hGH and anti-IGF-1 serum abrogated the growth-promoting effect enhanced by IGF-1. Similar statistically significant stimulatory properties were found when freshly obtained marrow cells from four of five acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of childhood and four acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients were studied in ALL and AML blast-cell clonogenic assays. ALL colonies increased numerically by 72% (P less than .025) and AML colonies by 92% (P less than .01) in the presence of hGH at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(2) and 3.0 x 10(2) ng/mL, respectively. IGF-1 stimulated ALL and AML blast-colony growth at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 ng/mL by up to 105% (P less than .025) and 65% (P less than .03), respectively. Our in vitro data suggest that circulating hGH and IGF-1 may promote leukemic blast cell replication in vivo, and the supplemental administration of hGH to leukemia patients in remission must be carefully monitored for early relapse.\r"

These children were diagnosed before 12 years of age and treated on four protocols in a single institution; all received either cranial (n = 78) or craniospinal (n = 37) prophylactic irradiation. Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%. Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%. Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than .0001) in children who had earlier disease onset. Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases. Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights. These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention.\r"

Our current approach combines the benefits of both policies in the management of massive renal tumors in children. In seven consecutive patients we first obtained a percutaneous posterior needle biopsy to obtain adequate tissue for histology, and proceeded with preoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and dactinomycin until tumor shrinkage was sufficient. Tumor removals were feasible and uneventful. At the time of operation, two tumors were found to be totally or almost totally necrotic. In the others, which still included viable tumor, the histology corresponded well to the needle biopsy findings. One case with unfavorable histology and one with rhabdoid sarcoma would have been missed and given suboptimal therapy without the primary needle biopsy. As possible biopsy-related complications, subcapsular intratumoral bleeding was recognized in two patients. We conclude that percutaneous posterior needle biopsy is safe and yields definite, detailed histology in massive renal tumors in children. Preoperative chemotherapy facilitates surgery in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate its toxicity and clinical efficacy in children with relapsed or refractory leukemia, we performed a phase I trial of 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-adenosine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine; 2-CDA) given as a continuous 5-day infusion at doses of 3 to 10.7 mg/m2/d. In this study of 31 children with acute leukemia, the only dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. At the highest dose level, three of seven patients developed fatal systemic bacterial or fungal infections. At dose levels above 6.2 mg/m2/d, significant oncolytic responses occurred in all patients. In addition, there was a significant correlation between both the responsiveness by cell type and dose of 2-CDA, such that more oncolytic responses were noted in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (P = .02). Although this was a phase I trial in heavily pretreated patients with refractory disease, two AML patients treated at 5.2 and 10.7 mg/m2/d, respectively, had complete hematologic responses, and one patient treated at 10.7 mg/m2/d had a partial response. In addition, there was a dose-response relationship in all patients with improved cytoreduction of peripheral blast cells at higher doses of 2-CDA. In vitro evaluation of 2-CDA uptake and anabolism by leukemic blast cells from 22 patients demonstrated that 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (Cld-AMP) and 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-striphosphate (CldATP) reached concentrations close to steady-state levels within 1 hour. Intracellular nucleotide disappearance rates were high with half-lives of 1.29 and 2.47 hours for CldAMP and CldATP, respectively. This suggests that continuous infusion is necessary to maintain the desired plasma concentration. The results of this study confirm the antileukemic activity of 2-CDA and the lack of prohibitive nonhematologic toxicity. Phase II trials in patients with AML and ALL are warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Combination chemotherapy is capable of curing many patients with newly diagnosed intermediate- and high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), but treatment of relapsed NHL remains problematic. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers the best chance for disease-free survival, but interim chemotherapy is often necessary while awaiting BMT, especially for patients with bulky disease. We report here 39 patients (median age, 44 years) who failed primary therapy with doxorubicin-based regimens and subsequently were treated with one to six cycles of dexamethasone, 40 mg intravenous (IV) every day on days 1 to 4, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 by continuous infusion on day 1, and cytarabine 2 g/m2 IV every 12 hours x two doses on day 2 (DHAP) before the planned BMT. Histologies included 16 diffuse large-cell, six diffuse mixed, five diffuse small-cleaved, four lymphoblastic, and eight other. Twenty-eight patients had stage IV disease, 13 had B symptoms, and 20 had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients had been treated with a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens. Sixty-one percent of patients had high tumor burdens according to the MD Anderson criteria. Objective responses to DHAP were seen in 26 patients (67%) including nine complete responses (CRs) (23%) and 17 partial responses (PRs) (44%), and responses lasted a median of 7.5 months. Myelosuppression was the major toxicity, but there were no treatment-related deaths. To date, 17 patients have undergone subsequent BMT with a projected 3-year disease-free survival of 15%. We conclude that the DHAP regimen is effective short-term salvage therapy for relapsed NHL patients, but the long-term prognosis of multiply relapsed patients remains poor.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of second primary cancer (SPC) was evaluated in 947 patients treated for Hodgkin's disease (HD) during the period January 1969 to December 1979. The median follow-up of this series was 10.5 years (range, 9 to 19). Treatment categories included radiotherapy (RT) alone (115 patients, 12%), chemotherapy (CHT) alone (161 patients, 17%), combined RT plus CHT (381 patients, 40%), and salvage treatment for resistant or relapsing HD (290 patients, 30.6%). Fifty-six SPCs were observed, occurring between 1 and 17 years from initial treatment. Among these, secondary acute nonlymphoid leukemia (s-ANLL) was the most frequent SPC (23 cases). Secondary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (s-NHL) occurred in 5 patients, whereas a secondary solid tumor (s-ST) was observed in 28 patients. The calculated actuarial risk (+/- SE) of developing SPC was 5.0% (+/- 0.9%) and 23.1% (+/- 5.8%) at 10 and 19 years, respectively. Concerning treatment modalities and s-ANLL risk, no cases were observed in the radiotherapy group, whereas CHT plus RT and salvage groups showed the highest actuarial risk. This was, in fact, at 10 and 19 years, 3.1% (+/- 0.9%) and 8.1% (+/- 4.0%) in the former group, and 1.8% (+/- 1.0%) and 16% (+/- 9.0%) in the latter. A statistically significant difference was observed when the CHT plus RT group was compared with CHT and RT groups (P = .04). Concerning the relationships with chemotherapeutic regimens, 12 s-ANLL cases occurred in the mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) plus RT group, and only one case in the group receiving doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) plus RT. A statistically significant difference of s-ANLL actuarial risk was found comparing patients receiving MOPP plus RT to all other treatment groups (P = .04). With respect to s-ST, the actuarial risk at 10 and 19 years was 2.0% (+/- 0.6%) and 13.0% (+/- 3.8%), respectively. No significant differences were found among groups treated with different modalities. These data were confirmed by a multivariate analysis, which indicated treatment modality and age as independent variables for s-ANLL and s-ST development, respectively. Based on the prolonged follow-up analysis, the actuarial SPC risk at 10 years hereby reported should reflect the real SPC incidence in our series.\r"

The pattern seen was one of contiguous spread from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area to the other mediastinal lymph node groups (aortopulmonary, subcarinal, posterior mediastinal, and internal mammary), to the hila, and then into the lung by extension or as discrete nodules. Involvement of the pleura, pericardium, or chest wall occurred only after the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal mass had enlarged to greater than 30% of the thoracic diameter. The probability that this pattern of contiguous lymph node spread occurred by chance alone was very small. Hodgkin's disease spreads from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area in a contiguous manner. Exceptions are unusual enough that when they occur, diagnoses other than Hodgkin's disease are more likely.\r"

To test this hypothesis, 95 patients scheduled to receive their first cycle of 5FU plus leucovorin were randomized to have oral cryotherapy at the time of chemotherapy administration or to serve as a control group. Subsequent mucositis was significantly reduced in the group assigned to receive cryotherapy as judged by the attending physicians (P = .0002) and by the patients themselves (P = .0001).

Eighty-nine percent of patients had a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status of 0-1. Twenty-one patients completed all prescribed treatments.

Thirty-two patients achieved a complete remission (CR) (57%) and fifteen achieved a partial remission (PR) (26%). Median survival for all patients is 11.1 months. Among the 21 patients who received intensification, nine remain alive in a CR with a median survival of 27 months. This sequence of treatments was not associated with a survival advantage for the group as a whole, possibly because of the toxicity of induction and consolidation treatment and the delayed administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide.\r"

Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease. Four had recurrent disease after surgery. Three-year follow-up is now available. Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years. Four have developed systemic metastases. Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%. Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime. Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases. No late sequelae have so far been recorded. It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional \"cures\" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients. The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic.\r"

PTX was administered at a starting dose of 25 mg orally three times per day for 5 days weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. Thirty-one patients were entered onto the study. Among 31 patients assessable for response, there were two complete responses (CRs) and five partial responses (PRs) for a response rate (CR plus PR) of 23% (95% confidence limit, 10% to 42%). Five responses occurred in soft tissue lesions, and two responses occurred in lung lesions. The initial dose schedule was well tolerated. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. PTX administered in this schedule appears to be active against malignant melanoma. Further clinical trials to confirm these results are underway.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercalcemia and leukocytosis may occur in conjunction as paraneoplastic syndromes associated with malignant disease. Here we describe a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla that was associated with hypercalcemia and leukocytosis, and also cachexia. The primary tumor was surgically removed and established in permanent cell culture. When either primary tumors or cultured tumor cells were inoculated into nude mice, the nude mice developed the same paraneoplastic syndromes as those which occurred in the patient from whom the tumor was originally derived. The plasma calcium was increased two and one-half-fold and the WBC count 30-fold, and the body weight was decreased by 45% in tumor-bearing animals. Each of these paraneoplastic syndromes was alleviated by surgical excision of the tumor, indicating that the paraneoplastic syndromes were due to a factor or factors produced by the primary tumor. The development of each of these paraneoplastic syndromes in nude mice correlated positively with the other two syndromes. We examined the organs of tumor-bearing mice and found striking histopathologic abnormalities in the bones, spleen, and liver, but no infiltration with tumor cells. The bones showed marked evidence of osteoclastic bone resorption. This model of a human tumor associated with the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis paraneoplastic syndrome, together with cachexia, should make it possible to determine the mechanisms responsible for these paraneoplastic syndromes and their relationship to each other.\r"

  ".U": "91154853\r", 
  ".W": "Ten patients with myeloid leukemias were treated in a phase I trial with escalating doses of mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) M195, reactive with CD33, a glycoprotein found on myeloid leukemia blasts and early hematopoietic progenitor cells but not on normal stem cells. M195 was trace-labeled with iodine-131 (131I) to allow detailed pharmacokinetic and dosimetric studies by serial sampling of blood and bone marrow and whole-body gamma-camera imaging. Total doses up to 76 mg were administered safely without immediate adverse effects. Absorption of M195 onto targets in vivo was demonstrated by biopsy, pharmacology, flow cytometry, and imaging; saturation of available sites occurred at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/m2. The entire bone marrow was specifically and clearly imaged beginning within hours after injection; optimal imaging occurred at the lowest dose. Bone marrow biopsies demonstrated significant dose-related uptake of M195 as early as 1 hour after infusion in all patients, with the majority of the dose found in the marrow. Tumor regressions were not observed. An estimated 0.33 to 1.0 rad/mCi 131I was delivered to the whole body, 1.1 to 6.1 rad/mCi was delivered to the plasma, and up to 34 rad/mCi was delivered to the red marrow compartment. 131I-M195 was rapidly modulated, with a majority of the bound immunoglobulin G (IgG) being internalized into target cells in vivo. These data indicate that whole bone marrow ablative doses of 131I-M195 can be expected. The rapid, specific, and quantitative delivery to the bone marrow and the efficient internalization of M195 into target cells in vivo also suggest that the delivery of other isotopes such as auger or alpha emitters, toxins, or other biologically important molecules into either leukemia cells or normal hematopoietic progenitor cells may be feasible.\r"

Doses ranging from 10 to 1,000 mg/m2 were administered over 30 minutes weekly times 3 weeks every 4 weeks. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 790 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with thrombocytopenia and anemia quantitatively more important than granulocytopenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. Two responses in patients with adenocarcinomas of the colon and lung were documented. The maximum dFdC plasma concentration, reached after 15 minutes of infusion, was proportional to the total dose administered. Elimination, due mainly to deamination, was rapid (terminal half-life [t1/2], 8.0 minutes) and dose independent. The deamination product 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) was eliminated with biphasic kinetics characterized by a long terminal phase (t1/2, 14 hours); it was the sole metabolite detected in urine. The concentration of dFdC 5'-triphosphate in circulating mononuclear cells increased in proportion to the dFdC dose at infusions between 35 and 250 mg/m2. No further increment in dFdC 5'-triphosphate (dFdCTP) was observed at higher doses, which resulted in plasma dFdC concentrations greater than 20 mumol/L (350 to 1,000 mg/m2), suggesting saturation of dFdC 5'-phosphate accumulation. The recommended dose for phase II clinical trials in solid tumors is 790 mg/m2/wk.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if chemotherapy dose intensity (DI) influences treatment outcome, 60 published studies in limited- and extensive-stage small-cell carcinoma of the lung (SCCL) were retrospectively analyzed for relationship between intended DI and response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or median survival (MS). Agents used in the regimens included cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (A), vincristine (V), etoposide (E), and cisplatin (P). Relative DI (RDI) of each study regimen was calculated against a reference regimen, and weighted regression analysis was used. Additionally, analysis of individual drug RDI within combinations was performed. For CAV, increasing RDI of the regimen showed no correlation with outcome. For the individual drugs, C RDI correlated positively, while A RDI correlated negatively with attainment of CR in limited disease, but both only after unduly influential observations were eliminated. In extensive-stage disease, A RDI correlated positively with CR+, PR but only in randomized trials, and this correlation lost statistical significance after unduly influential observations were eliminated. For CAE and CAVE, the RDI of the regimens correlated positively with MS in extensive-stage disease as did the C RDI. In limited disease, the C RDI correlated negatively with MS. For EP, no significant correlations were seen. We conclude that DI-outcome correlations are not consistent for these chemotherapy regimens in SCCL. Meta-analysis of retrospective data can generate hypotheses for testing in prospective clinical trials, but study sample and method of analysis can appreciably affect conclusions.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology and options for management of bone metastases as well as criteria for determining response to therapy are reviewed. Bone metastases are frequently one of the first signs of disseminated disease in cancer patients. In the majority of patients, the primary tumor is in the breast, prostate, or lungs. Although almost all patients will die of their disease, a proportion of the patients will survive for several years. Treatment is primarily palliative: the intention is to relieve pain, prevent fractures, maintain activity and mobility, and, if possible, to prolong survival. Therapeutic options include local treatment with radiotherapy and/or surgery, and systemic treatment using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, radioisotopes, agents such as diphosphonates, which inhibit resorption of bone, as well as analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs. The mechanisms by which pain is relieved by several of these therapies remain unclear but actions beyond a simple tumoricidal effect appear to be important. There have been few randomized trials comparing the therapeutic options, and the criteria for assessing response to therapy have, in general, been poorly defined. There is a need for rigorous clinical investigations that assess the efficacy of the various therapeutic possibilities by using well-defined and validated criteria of response.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with pre- post measures of smoking rates. This paper reports six-month outcome data. SETTING: Participants were recruited from among patients seen by 196 medical and family practice residents in five primary care clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 1,286 patients out of 1,946 eligible smokers approached. The patient group was 57% female and 91% white, had an average age of 35 years, and smoked, on average, slightly over one pack per day. INTERVENTION: Physicians were trained to provide each of three interventions: advice only, brief patient-centered counseling, and counseling plus prescription of nicotine-containing gum (Nicorette). Half the patients received follow-up in the form of telephone counseling at three-monthly intervals from behavioral counselors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Changes in smoking behaviors were assessed by telephone interview six months after physician intervention. The differences in one-week point prevalence cessation rates among the physician interventions were significant (p less than 0.01): advice only, 9.1%; counseling, 11.9%; counseling plus gum, 17.4%; with no effect for telephone counseling. The time elapsed from physician encounter to initial quitting and the length of that period of abstinence also showed significant benefit of the counseling interventions. Patients receiving physician counseling were much more likely than those not receiving counseling to rate their physician as very helpful (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analyses are also reported. CONCLUSION: Smoking intervention counseling provided by physicians is well received by patients and significantly increases the likelihood of cessation at six months, an effect that is augmented by the prescription of nicotine-containing gum, when compared with physician-delivered advice. Follow-up telephone counseling does not contribute significantly to smoking behavior changes.\r"

DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey. SETTING: Survey conducted November 1988-April 1989. PARTICIPANTS: All 771 non-military U.S. internal medicine and family medicine program directors were surveyed; 80% responded. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: While 91% of the directors felt that primary care of AIDS patients was an important educational experience and 94% reported that their programs usually had AIDS inpatients, only 16% reported that the majority of trainees cared for AIDS patients in their continuity clinics. Even at programs that typically had six or more AIDS inpatients, only 26% of directors reported that most residents had cared for an AIDS patient in their continuity clinics. Among the 57% who did not believe or were unsure whether their residents were adequately trained in AIDS ambulatory care, only 38% reported improving resident education in this area to be a high priority. Among the 39% who did not encourage residents' assumption of primary care, 60% had at least one of the following concerns: AIDS care too stressful for residents (24%), AIDS care too complicated for generalists (31%), or clinic faculty not qualified to supervise residents' caring for AIDS patients (39%). CONCLUSION: Although program directors view education in AIDS ambulatory care as important, most do not believe that residents are adequately trained, many do not encourage residents' assumption of primary care of AIDS patients, and residents usually have not provided such care in their programs. Strategies to augment residents' ambulatory experience in AIDS care are needed.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of two intervention methods that aimed to increase the percentage of adult clinic patients who completed living wills and placed them on file with their physicians within a four-month period. DESIGN: There were one control and two intervention groups. Surveys were separated by age and gender categories and randomly selected for the final sample. SETTING: The internal medicine outpatient clinic of a large tertiary hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who visited the clinic were asked whether they would be willing to fill out a survey. The final sample included 167 adult patients who comprised three study groups. INTERVENTIONS: The first intervention relied solely on a booklet that described the Minnesota Living Will Act, general information concerning advance directives, and medical interventions that could be considered extraordinary if used for a patient in a terminal condition. The second intervention relied on both the booklet and repeated physician-initiated discussions with the patient about the probable value of a living will. MAIN RESULTS: The booklet/physician intervention was found to be significantly more effective than either the booklet-only intervention or no intervention (p less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The physician intervention used in this population could be undertaken in any primary care clinic. Time spent in discussion before a crisis may be significantly shorter and qualitatively better than time spent in discussion with families who must make decisions during a crisis.\r"

DESIGN: A prospective consecutive series of office patients completed the Rand Corporation's General Health Perceptions Questionnaire, and their physicians rated their physical health. Their use of health care services was determined for the following 12 months. SETTING: A rural teaching office practice. PATIENTS: Of 243 adult patients asked to complete the questionnaire, 32 were excluded, for dementia (8), illiteracy (4), illness (8), incomplete questionnaires (6), and other reasons (6). 208 patients (86%) formed the final study group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 62 of 208 patients had poor health perception scores. 39 of the 62 were rated by physicians as physically healthy and were not statistically different in physical health ratings or numbers of prescribed medications from the 146 patients who had higher health perception scores. However, these 39 patients had significantly more health-related worry, acute pain, and depression than did the other 146 patients. They also made more office visits and telephone calls and had higher total primary care charges. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that 21% of adult primary care patients (39 of 208) have health perceptions lower than expected for their levels of physical health. These low health perceptions are correlated with increased emotional distress and higher utilization of health care resources. Strategies to identify these patients and interventions to improve their views of their health could reduce utilization.\r"

SETTING: Medical school-affiliated primary care clinic. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Case presentations of 20 patients who had dermatologic problems were prepared in the form of photographs with accompanying histories. All cases were presented to 17 of 21 available faculty internists who answered questions concerning diagnosis and management of the cases on a questionnaire. The responses of three board-certified faculty dermatologists were used as a reference standard. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The internists had had an average of three weeks' total formal dermatology training. Overall, 60% of cases were correctly diagnosed by the internists and 89% of these were either treated appropriately or referred to dermatologists. In 40% of incorrectly diagnosed cases, internists failed to refer and the majority of these were treated inappropriately. Of referrals deemed appropriate by dermatologists, only 62% were made. Conversely, 33% of referrals were deemed unnecessary. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty internists were able to diagnose many common skin diseases despite having received little dermatology training. However, errors in diagnosis occurred frequently and when diagnoses were incorrect there was a tendency to mismanage. These data suggest that the current amount of dermatology training is inadequate to prepare future primary care physicians for their increased role in the management of skin disorders.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective, cohort pilot study. SETTING: Clinical research center within a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirteen athletic men, mean age 44.8 years, with borderline or labile hypertension, taking no medication. All 13 completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Three baseline assessments of psychological state, symptom checklist, and assessment of autonomic response to infusion of beta agonist (isoproterenol). Daily relaxation response exercises for five consecutive weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Discontinuation of relaxation exercises for subsequent five weeks followed by repeat assessment of all parameters. Measurements and main results: After eliciting the relaxation response, subjects demonstrated significant decreases in anxiety (p less than 0.014) and somatic symptoms (p less than 0.02). Psychological and somatic variables returned toward baseline after the subsequent discontinuation of relaxation exercises. No significant concomitant change in urinary catecholamines, heart rate response to isoproterenol, blood pressure, pulse rate, or serum cholesterol was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The regular elicitation of the relaxation response can improve psychological performance and reduce symptoms. However, the physiologic mechanism whereby these psychological and symptomatic improvements occur remains poorly understood and warrants further investigation.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized controlled factorial trial. SETTING: Eleven residency programs, in internal medicine (six), family medicine (three), and pediatrics (two). Programs were located in three university medical centers and four university-affiliated community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 261 residents who saw ambulatory care patients at least one half-day per week, and 937 returning patients aged 17 to 75 years who reported having smoked five or more cigarettes in the preceding seven days. Of the 937, 843 were eligible for follow-up, and 659 (78%) were interviewed by phone at six months. INTERVENTIONS: Two interventions (tutorial and prompt) and four groups. The tutorial was a two-hour educational program in minimal-contact smoking cessation counseling for residents. The prompt was a chart-based reminder to assist physician counseling. One group of residents received the tutorial; one, the prompt; and one, both. A fourth group received no intervention. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Six months after the intervention, physician self-reports showed that residents in the tutorial + prompt and tutorial-only groups had used more counseling techniques (1.5-1.9) than had prompt-only or control residents (0.9). Residents in all three intervention groups advised more patients to quit smoking (76-79%) than did control group residents (69%). The tutorial had more effect on counseling practices than did the prompt. Physician confidence, perceived preparedness, and perceived success followed similar patterns. Exit interviews with 937 patients corroborated physician self-reports of counseling practices. Six months later, self-reported and biochemically verified patient quitting rates for residents in the three intervention groups (self-reported: 5.3-8.2%; biochemically verified: 3.4-5.7%) were higher than those for residents in the control group (self-reported: 5.2%; biochemically verified: 1.7%), though the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A simple and feasible educational intervention can increase residents' smoking cessation counseling.\r"

None of the current approaches to prevention of GVHD succeed at meeting these expectations, although postgrafting immunosuppressive therapy comes closest to the ideal. The technique of T cell depletion has been very effective in reducing the incidence of GVHD, but conditioning programs must be developed that will be more successful at eliminating host immune and malignant cells. It is doubtful that this will be achieved with systemic chemotherapy and total body irradiation. Innovative approaches such as the use of monoclonal antibodies, either alone or linked to short-lived radioactive isotopes with short linear energy transfer, promise to result in less toxic but more efficient programs, not only providing better eradication of malignant disease but also ameliorating the problem of graft failure. It is conceivable, however, that it will never be possible to kill all leukemic cells with chemoradiotherapy of any form, and the graft-versus-leukemia effect may be essential. Perhaps in the future it will be possible to distinguish lymphocytes causing the graft-versus-leukemia effect from those causing GVHD, isolate them, and use them in attempts at therapy. In the meantime, postgrafting immunosuppressive drugs are used most frequently to prevent and treat GVHD, and steadily improving survival statistics can be expected.\r"

To what extent these immune approaches may enable eradication of microscopic amounts of residual diseases in children who would otherwise have a recurrence of their malignancies remains the critical issue for testing over the next decade. Enthusiasm regarding this approach is abundant, but critical evaluation of all clinical trials is essential to best focus these mechanisms into effective therapy.\r"

To determine the proportion of exposed infants who are infected, we conducted a hospital-based prospective study in HIV-1-infected women whose infants were delivered at a single metropolitan hospital in Miami, Fla. A population of uninfected women and their infants was also enrolled and followed longitudinally for 2 years to assess laboratory and clinical measurements. The median follow-up is now 18 months for 82 infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers. The proportion of infected infants in this group is 0.30 (25/82). None of the infants born to 110 HIV-1-seronegative mothers were seropositive. Infected infants were easily distinguished from noninfected infants by virus isolation. No single immunologic or hematologic measure was predictive of infection for all infants at risk for HIV-1 infection who were 6 months of age or younger. As a group, however, infected infants could be distinguished from uninfected index infants by a number of immunologic measures by 6 months of age; the absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes and the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio were the variables most predictive of infection. As in retrospective studies, clinical disease developed in 80% of infected infants within the first 24 months of life. This study provides documentation of HIV-1 perinatal transmission risk and early correlates of infection in young infants from a single hospital.\r"

We also found evidence of sucrose malabsorption and persistent diarrheal disease in three of the children. Extensive microbiologic evaluations failed to reveal an etiologic agent related to the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

DESIGN: Four immunogenicity trials with sera were assayed in one laboratory. Trials 1 and 2 each compared one vaccine in two regions, and trials 3 and 4 were randomized comparisons of multiple vaccines within a region. SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 313 healthy children recruited from pediatric practices in Minneapolis, Minn., Dallas and Houston, Tex., and Sellersville, Pa.

Among the former, there were no significant differences in antibody response to vaccination with the different conjugates within any of the trials. Among children with less than or equal to 0.15 microgram/ml of antibody before vaccination, there were no significant differences in the geometric mean antibody responses of children in trial 1 vaccinated with polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria toxoid (PRP-D) in Dallas or in Minneapolis, or of children in trial 3 in Dallas randomly assigned to receive Hib oligosaccharide-CRM197 (HbOC) or PRP-D. In contrast, in trial 2, children given PRP-tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) in Pennsylvania had a significantly higher geometric mean antibody response than children given PRP-T in Houston (13.5 vs 3.0 micrograms/ml; p = 0.005). In trial 4 in Minneapolis, the geometric mean antibody response was highest in children randomly assigned to receive PRP-outer membrane protein (OMP) (9.3 micrograms/ml), followed by PRP-D (5.0 micrograms/ml) and HbOC (2.3 micrograms/ml) (PRP-OMP vs HbOC; p = 0.005). In all four trials, IgG1 responses predominated compared with IgG2 responses. CONCLUSIONS: All four conjugate vaccines are immunogenic in children 17 to 19 months of age. However, the magnitude of the anticapsular antibody response varied by vaccine type, the level of antibody in prevaccination sera, and geographic location.\r"

  ".W": "Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised.\r"

  ".U": "91154993\r", 
  ".W": "Fundoplication with gastrostomy has become a frequent treatment for patients with familial dysautonomia, so we evaluated the use of both procedures in 65 patients. Although patients differed widely in presenting signs and age, from 5 weeks to 40 years, gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 95% of patients by cineradiography or pH monitoring. Panendoscopy was a useful adjunct. Preoperative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux included vomiting, respiratory infections, and exaggerated autonomic dysfunction. Severe oropharyngeal incoordination frequently coexisted and resulted in misdirected swallows with aspiration, dependence on gavage feedings, or poor weight gain and dehydration. Follow-up after surgical correction ranged from 3 months to 11 years; 55 patients (85%) were available for a 1-year postoperative assessment. We had no instances of surgical death. The long-term mortality rate was 14%, primarily related to severe preexisting respiratory disease. Beyond the first postoperative year, 30 patients had pneumonia attributed to continued aspiration, exacerbation of preexisting lung disease, or recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux. Of 11 patients who vomited postoperatively, six had recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux was documented in eight patients (12%), and we revised the fundoplication in three patients. The number of patients with cyclic crises was reduced from 18 to 7; retching replaced overt vomiting in all but two of these seven patients, neither of whom had recurrence of reflux. Because oropharyngeal incoordination was prominent, concomitant use of gastrostomy and an antireflux procedure was especially effective in the treatment of younger patients with familial dysautonomia, before the development of severe respiratory disease. Despite the development of severe morning nausea in 15 patients, the combination procedure resulted in significantly improved nutritional status, decreased vomiting, and decreased respiratory problems. Appropriate use of gastrostomy feedings also contributed to success of the operation. The generally good outcome of fundoplication with gastrostomy confirms the benefit of this procedure in familial dysautonomia.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether correction for preterm birth should be applied during developmental assessment, we conducted a prospective national survey of very premature infants (born at less than 32 weeks of gestation); neurodevelopment in the first 2 years was studied with the Dutch child health care developmental assessment. In 555 preterm children who had no evidence of handicap at 2 years of age, the age at which developmental milestones were reached was established. The results were compared with the results of the same assessment in Dutch children born at term. During the first year, the development of the very premature children equaled the development of normal children when full correction was applied. At 2 years of age, development was equal to or better than normal children's development without correction. We conclude that full correction for prematurity should be applied in the first year to avoid overreferral for developmental stimulation, whereas at 2 years of age correction is not necessary.\r"

Milk from mothers and serum from infants were collected at 16.3 +/- 2.4 days. Milk was studied for its effect on the absorption of bilirubin labeled with carbon 14 in rats and compared with buffer and iron-fortified infant formula (Similac With Iron). The percentage of a 1 mg bilirubin dose absorbed by the rat was 25.29 +/- 4.0% when it was administered into the duodenum with buffer, 4.67 +/- 2.4% with Similac formula, and 7.7 +/- 2.9% with human milk. Linear regression analysis, using the infant's serum nonconjugated bilirubin level as the dependent variable and the percentage of (14C)bilirubin absorbed by the rat with the corresponding mother's milk as the independent variable, revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.40; p = 0.016). Inspection of the data suggested that absorptive permissiveness correlated closely with infant serum bilirubin values greater than 24 mumol/L (1.4 mg/dl) (r = 0.55; p = 0.007), whereas in those with bilirubin values less than or equal to 24 mumol/L, there was no apparent correlation. Milk was also analyzed for beta-glucuronidase, nonesterified fatty acids, and the ability to inhibit glucuronosyltransferase activity of rat liver microsomes in vitro, none of which correlated with the infant's serum bilirubin. These data support the theory that enhanced intestinal absorption of bilirubin contributes to the jaundice associated with breast-feeding.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on cardiac function and its determinants (preload, afterload, contractility, and heart rate) are largely unknown, although some evidence exists that function may decrease. To determine whether cardiac function decreases and what changes in the determinants take place during and after ECMO, we observed 26 newborn infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension. Serial echocardiograms were performed before ECMO, during maximum cardiopulmonary bypass, and after ECMO. Cardiac function was assessed by using standard echographic ejection phase indices (shortening fraction and cardiac output). Heart rate, preload (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and area), afterload (left ventricular end-systolic wall stress), and contractility (relationship between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and wall stress) were also measured. Ejection phase indices significantly decreased during ECMO (shortening fraction 33% to 25%, cardiac output 205 to 113 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05) and returned to normal after ECMO (shortening fraction 26% to 34%, cardiac output 107 to 240 ml/kg/per minute; p less than 0.05). Heart rate also significantly decreased during ECMO (158 to 118 beats/min; p less than 0.05). Preload significantly increased after ECMO (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 1.4 to 1.6 cm, left ventricular end-diastolic area 1.9 to 2.2 cm2; p less than 0.05). There were no significant changes in contractility and afterload during any study period. We conclude that, although left ventricular ejection phase indices and heart rate decreased during ECMO, these changes were transient and resolved when bypass was terminated. Contractility and afterload did not appear affected by bypass.\r"

Infants were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 25) received conventional therapy and group 2 (n = 34) received ECMO therapy after meeting established criteria. Ventilatory and oxygenation indexes and estimates of right ventricular systolic pressure were measured. Load-dependent and load-independent echocardiographic indexes of cardiac performance were also measured. The infants in the two groups had similar diagnoses, age, weight, inotropic support, ventilator and oxygenation indexes on admission, and survival. Heart rate and estimates of preload and afterload were similar in the two groups. Ventricular shortening fraction was 36.1 +/- 7.6% in group 1 and 40.5 +/- 8.8% in group 2 (p value was not significant). Velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (VCF/sec) was 1.41 +/- 0.35 in group 1 and 1.58 +/- 0.39 in group 2 (p value was not significant). The relationship between wall stress and ventricular shortening was similar in the two groups. There were no differences in cardiac output. Pulmonary artery pressure was estimated to be 56 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 and 63 +/- 10 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.017). Thus no significant differences were found in load-dependent or load-independent measures of cardiac performance in infants with severe lung disease treated with ECMO or conventional therapy. We conclude that cardiac failure is not the primary cause of clinical deterioration in infants with severe lung disease who require ECMO therapy.\r"

Cognitive functioning tests and self-report measures were administered at baseline and after each medication phase. Behavior ratings were obtained from parents and teachers. Parents' and teachers' ratings did not reflect a theophylline effect on attention or activity level; children's self-reports showed no changes in mood, and no statistically significant differences were found on measures of cognitive processing. Large individual differences in sensitivity to theophylline effects were present. Although most of the children tolerated theophylline well, those already having attentional or achievement problems appeared vulnerable to adverse effects. Individual response differences should be a focus of future studies.\r"

  ".W": "A randomized, prospective trial of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), that is, a method of analgesia administration involving a computer-driven pump activated by patients to receive small doses within defined limits was performed in 82 children and adolescents after major orthopedic surgery to compare (1) intramuscularly administered morphine, (2) PCA morphine and (3) PCA morphine with a low-dose continuous morphine infusion (PCA-plus). Patients receiving PCA and PCA-plus had lower pain scores and greater satisfaction than patients receiving intramuscularly administered morphine. The three groups used equal amounts of morphine and most measures of recovery were identical in the groups. In particular, PCA and PCA-plus did not increase the incidence of opioid-related complications, and patients receiving PCA-plus were less sedated than patients receiving intramuscular therapy. We conclude that PCA and PCA-plus are safe and effective methods of pain relief in children and adolescents after orthopedic surgery, are better accepted than intramuscular injections, and do not increase perioperative morbidity.\r"

  ".U": "91155012\r", 
  ".W": "Junior high students (n = 1508) from a midwestern community completed a health behavioral questionnaire that asked the frequency of headache and abdominal pain and of a number of behavioral and emotional risk indicators. Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints. The evaluation of persistent somatic complaints in adolescents, particularly in boys with abdominal symptoms, should include careful examination of emotional risk factors and other health-endangering behaviors such as substance use, early sexual activity, and delinquency.\r"

Oncogene expression, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors, and the fraction of cells in S phase are useful biochemical prognostic indicators of clinical outcome, and markers recognized by monoclonal antibodies are available for use in following the clinical course of the disease and responses to treatment. In vivo and in vitro studies on normal and neoplastic tissues are providing evidence of paracrine influences on epithelial cell proliferation. Long-term administration of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer has recently been found to increase the risk for development of endometrial cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic intra-arterial (HIA) infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) via an implanted pump has shown promise in the treatment of colorectal cancer metastasized to the liver. However, the potential benefit of this therapy may be offset by the high incidence of treatment-limiting biliary toxicity. Although weekly HIA bolus of fluorouracil (5-FU) is effective against metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver with no biliary toxicity, it is limited by systemic side effects. In December 1986, we began a phase II trial of alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU via the implanted pump in an attempt to extend the duration of treatment by obviating the limiting biliary (FUDR) and systemic (5-FU) drug toxic effects. Patients received continuous HIA FUDR at 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day on days 1 through 8 followed by an HIA bolus of 5-FU at 15 mg/kg given via the pump sideport on days 15, 22, and 29, with the cycle repeated every 35 days. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled in this trial, and 64 were fully evaluable. Of the 64 patients, 30 (47%) previously had received chemotherapy. Major response (complete response plus partial response) was observed in 32 (50%) of 64 patients, and the median survival from pump implantation in all patients was 22.4 months. In contrast to the experience with the single-agent HIA FUDR regimen, no patient had treatment terminated because of drug toxicity. Alternating HIA FUDR and 5-FU has efficacy similar to that of HIA FUDR given alone, but when closely monitored and adjusted appropriately, is not associated with toxic effects requiring treatment termination.\r"

These results were validated further by the hazard ratio of 4.54 (95% confidence interval, 2.57 to 8.03) among invasive relative to noninvasive bladder cancer cases when the slide review findings were used. In contrast, the hazard ratio was only 1.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.76 to 3.79) when the Iowa SEER Program findings were used. The traditional method used by the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program to deal with this problem is described and its implications are discussed.\r"

We present here the first quantitative study of the in vivo movement of fluorescently labeled adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells. These cells were injected intra-arterially along with low-dose interleukin-2 into normal (mature granulation) tissue and an implant of VX2 carcinoma grown in the rabbit ear chamber. A small proportion of A-LAK cells accumulated preferentially in the tumor microcirculation in vivo because of an increased frequency of long-term adhesive interactions with the tumor vasculature. Stasis of blood flow in the tumor vasculature was observed 1 to 2 days after injection. Subsequent necrosis of the tumors was observed, along with diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in the interstitial space within the tumor. Development of necrosis despite low ratios of effector cells to target cells suggests that in addition to direct cytotoxicity, the response to adoptive immunotherapy is mediated via the tumor vasculature. This novel mechanism for adoptive immunotherapy must be taken into account in the development of improved strategies for cancer treatment.\r"

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 to 12 g/m2 for a single dose of uridine and 5 g/m2 for the multiple-dose regimen. Diarrhea was the dose-limiting toxic effect. Single-dose oral uridine resulted in an increase in plasma uridine concentrations in the range of 60 to 80 microM after doses of 8 to 12 g/m2. At these doses, bioavailability of oral uridine ranged from 5.8% to 9.9%. At the MTD of 5 g/m2 in the multiple-dose uridine schedule, steady-state plasma uridine levels of approximately 50 microM were achieved. Further studies should explore the role of oral uridine in the modulation of the toxicity of fluorouracil.\r"

  ".U": "91155138\r", 
  ".W": "Permanent ligation of arteries supplying blood to the spinal cord in operations for aortic aneurysm can lead to spinal cord ischemia, which can result in either paraparesis or paraplegia. This report describes a rapid method of intraoperative identification of those arteries that supply the spinal cord by use of an intrathecal platinum electrode to detect hydrogen in solution that has been injected into the aortic ostia. Preservation or perfusion of those identified arteries supplying the spinal cord may decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic complications. Of 28 porcine experiments with postoperative observation for 24 hours, there were 3 initial pilot experiments in which saline saturated with hydrogen was injected into the temporarily cross-clamped aorta. Twenty animals were then randomized to (1) preservation of only the vessels sequentially identified to supply blood to the spinal cord from T-13 to L-5 (n = 10); (2) division of the vessels supplying the spinal cord (n = 10). A further five animals underwent perfusion experiments wherein the identified cord arteries were perfused by a shunt, the other nonsupply arteries were divided, and the aorta was kept clamped for 45 minutes. Spinal motor evoked potentials were elicited with an intrathecal electrode and were highly sensitive for paralysis. Paralysis occurred in 0/3 pilot (p less than 0.013 vs division); 8/10 division; 1/10 preservation (p less than 0.0017 vs division); and perfusion 1/5 (p less than 0.025 vs division). Results of a pilot study in eight humans shows that the technique can be used to rapidly identify segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, to determine if distal perfusion is supplying the spinal cord with blood flow, and if reattached segmental arteries are patent.\r"

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the precise origin of these cells. Therefore we have compared cellular characteristics of these cells with those of endothelial cells isolated by collagenase treatment of human umbilical veins. The omental cells were isolated from from omental tissue from four different patients by incubation in a collagenase-dispase solution. Part of the material was processed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation in an attempt to purify the isolates. Cellular characteristics of both types of cells were determined by studying the morphologic features of the cells and by determining the presence of von Willebrand factor, antigens EN-4 and PAL-E specific for endothelial cells, cytokeratins 8 and 18, vimentin and desmin, and uptake of diI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Epitheloid cells from omental tissue, isolated after collagenase treatment and either purified or nonpurified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, differed from human umbilical vein endothelial cells with respect to the presence of surface microvilli, the expression of von Willebrand factor, EN-4 and PAL-E, and the presence of cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin. von Willebrand factor (in a granular staining pattern) and the presence of EN-4 and PAL-E were only detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Vimentin was present in both cell types, whereas cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin were only present in cells derived from omentum. From these data we conclude that the so called microvascular endothelial cells from omentum are not endothelial but mesothelial in nature.\r"

This method involves passage of a stiff dilator and a peel-away sheath over a guide wire, and is usually carried out without fluoroscopy. For the most part this has proved to be a valuable and safe approach. However, a small incidence of major complications occurs, which needs to be emphasized. Sixteen cases of arteriovenous fistulas between the subclavian artery or its branches and the subclavian vein have been reported so far in the literature. To date only one case of subclavian artery to innominate vein fistula has been reported. We report the second case with this complication and suggest possible preventive measures.\r"

The right common iliac artery was divided in 15 rabbits. In eight rabbits a muscle flap based on the left deep inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh (flap group). In seven rabbits a sham operation was performed where the flap was sutured to the abdominal wall (sham group). After 7 days angiography demonstrated arterial connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in all of the flap group animals. The flap increased muscle perfusion in the ischemic limb (2.99 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the flap group, vs 2.06 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the sham group, p less than 0.005). Hemodynamically significant vascular connections will develop between a well-perfused muscle flap and an ischemic limb. The augmentation in perfusion provided by these connections can be quantified.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging and duplex scanning in the diagnosis of catheter-induced subclavian vein thrombosis, we correlated the results of 43 arm phlebograms with duplex scans; 28 of these phlebograms were also correlated with magnetic resonance imaging scans of the thoracic veins. Eighteen of the 43 phlebograms were normal, and all had normal magnetic resonance imaging and duplex studies. Eleven subclavian veins were totally occluded on phlebography; all had duplex scans, and five were also scanned with magnetic resonance imaging. Duplex scans detected 6 of 11 occlusions, whereas magnetic resonance imaging detected 4 of the 5 occlusions scanned. The five occlusions that were not detected by either magnetic resonance imaging or duplex scans were short segmental occlusions of the medial one third of the left subclavian vein. Of 14 nonocclusive thrombi seen on phlebography, duplex scans correctly identified 8. Magnetic resonance imaging was done on eight nonocclusive thrombi but identified only two. All abnormal findings on duplex scanning and magnetic resonance imaging were confirmed by phlebography. Short occlusions of the proximal portion of the left subclavian vein were often undetected by duplex scanning but occasionally seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Neither modality was sensitive to the presence of nonocclusive mural thrombi. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in ruling out the presence of a thrombotic process in the subclavian vein, but it may on occasion fail to detect the presence of subclavian thrombi. For this reason, in cases with suspected subclavian vein thrombosis magnetic resonance imaging cannot be used as the only diagnostic modality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of aneurysmal disease was analyzed in 50 patients who were treated for 71 popliteal aneurysms. No patients were lost to follow-up (mean, 5.0 years). Initially, 25 popliteal aneurysms (25/71; 35%) were treated nonsurgically, and 46 (46/71; 65%) were treated surgically. Complications developed in 12 of the 21 asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms (57%) and in 2 of the 4 symptomatic popliteal aneurysms (50%), which were treated nonsurgically. The probability of developing complications increased with time to 74% within 5 years. When reconstruction of a popliteal aneurysm was performed, graft patency and foot salvage were 64% and 95% at 10 years, respectively. Particularly acute arterial thromboembolism was a severe presenting complication. Another important finding was the development of 23 arteriosclerotic aneurysms at other locations during follow-up in 16 patients (32%). The probability of developing these new aneurysms increased to 49% 10 years after repair of the initial popliteal aneurysm. The presence of multiple isolated aneurysms at the initial examination was the most significant risk factor limiting the survival of these patients. Consequently patients at risk could be identified early. This study confirms the limb-threatening potential of popliteal aneurysms when left untreated. Therefore prophylactic reconstructive surgery should be undertaken. Moreover, this study demonstrates that patients with a popliteal artery aneurysm have an increased risk of new aneurysm formation, both in the popliteal artery and at other locations. Therefore these patients should be followed and, in the event that new aneurysms develop, should be considered for elective reconstructive surgery to prevent limb-threatening or life-endangering complications.\r"

  ".U": "91155146\r", 
  ".W": "Interval gangrene, segmental ischemic necrosis proximal to a functioning distal anastomosis, is a rare complication after successful peripheral vascular reconstruction. Previous reports have demonstrated the gravity of this event in that major limb amputation was required in all cases. Two cases are presented to emphasize the need for maintaining segmental collateral circulation after successful distal extremity bypass. Despite a satisfactory result after distal (inframalleolar) bypass of a popliteal aneurysm, one patient had progressive ischemic gangrene of the upper leg and eventually required amputation. The contralateral limb was successfully managed by distal ligation of the superficial femoral artery, which maintained collateral flow from the proximal superficial femoral artery to the knee and leg. The second patient required a microvascular free flap to replace tissue loss and provide vascular graft coverage after initial multiple bypass failures and a final successful remote reconstruction to the dorsal artery of the foot that excluded the popliteal-crural collateral network. Patients with inadequate collateral circulation or disruption of the profundus or geniculate collateral pathways may require revascularization of sequential vascular beds. Recognition of the potential for interval gangrene is essential since the likelihood of its occurrence will increase in proportion to the number of distal bypasses being performed for limb salvage. Although adjunctive procedures will not completely eliminate the possibility of interval gangrene, awareness of this phenomenon with attention to the segmental collateral circulation can decrease the incidence of its occurrence.\r"

  ".W": "The carotid-carotid cervical bypass is one surgical option for symptomatic atherosclerotic lesions of the innominate artery. Controversy exists regarding the necessity of surgically excluding the innominate plaque from the cerebral circuit. A canine study was instituted to characterize the hemodynamic alterations that occur in the right common carotid artery proximal to the bypass graft, termed the critical segment. The direction of flow in the critical segment determines whether emboli originating in the innominate may be propelled cranially despite a patent bypass graft. Six mongrel dogs underwent placement of an autogenous arterial crossover graft as a carotid-carotid bypass. A stenosis of the innominate artery was quantitatively altered, and an electromagnetic flowmeter measured the magnitude and direction of flow in the critical segment at three levels of diameter reduction in the innominate artery. For low-grade stenoses, flow in the critical segment was always prograde. For high-grade stenoses, the flow was always reversed. Stenoses between 57% and 67% yielded flow values of 10 +/- 24 ml/min, and it was in this range that mean flow reversal was found to occur. Even when the mean flow was near zero in the critical segment, flow was not stagnant but oscillated in antegrade and retrograde directions throughout the cardiac cycle. These data indicate that a carotid-carotid bypass causes complete flow reversal in the critical segment when there is high-grade stenosis in the innominate artery. Theoretical analysis of the hemodynamic circuit indicated that arm exercise would augment retrograde flow in the critical segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The skewflap technique was performed in 98 and the long posterior flap was performed in 93. The two groups were well matched in respect to age, sex, smoking, diabetes, and indications for amputation. Early outcome was compared in terms of 30-day mortality rate: skew 11 (11%) deaths versus long posterior flap 16 (17%); the state of the wound at 1 week (primary healing 60% in both groups); the need for surgical revision at the same level 7 (7%) versus 7 (8%), and revision to a higher level 10 (10%) versus 7 (8%). Follow-up information at 6 months was available from records or by mailed questionnaire in 188 (98%) at 6 months, 20 died during that interval. It showed that a prosthetic limb was fitted to 64 (84%) of skew flaps and 50 (77%) of long posterior flaps. Walking, alone or with support, was achieved in 59 (78%) and 46 (71%), respectively. None of these differences reached statistical significance. It is concluded that the skew flap is just as effective as the long posterior flap and is an excellent option for below-knee amputation.\r"

We theorized that hypoxia could shift normal endothelium into a procoagulant state and tested this hypothesis in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells were obtained from fresh umbilical cords. Passage two cells were placed in control (PO2 greater than 120 mm Hg) or hypoxic (PO2 less than 60 mm Hg) media and incubated in control or hypoxic environments for 24 hours. In additional experiments, cells were reoxygenated for 4 or 48 hours after the initial hypoxic period. Cells were then assayed for procoagulant activity expressed as thromboplastin unit equivalents per 100,000 cells based on a thromboplastin standard curve. Results are expressed as percent increase in thromboplastin unit equivalents/100,000 cells +/- standard error versus control. Statistical significance was assessed by paired t test with p less than 0.05 considered significant. More than 95% of cells in all experimental and control preparations were viable after completion of the protocols. No morphologic variation was noted among the control and hypoxic groups. For cells rendered hypoxic without reoxygenation, the mean increase in procoagulant activity for the group (n = 4) versus control was 77% +/- 13% (p = 0.01). In the hypoxia and 4-hour reoxygenation group (n = 4), the mean increase in procoagulant activity was 141% +/- 43% (p less than 0.05). In cells reoxygenated for 48 hours after hypoxia (n = 8), the mean increase in procoagulant activity was 198% +/- 34% (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A large personal experience on the surgical treatment of such a disease (29 cases in 22 patients) allowed us to focus on the optimal diagnostic procedure useful to detect this problem at an early stage. The technique is based on continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning studies done both in the resting state and during active contraction of the calf muscles. If compression of the popliteal artery occurs with contraction of the calf muscles, it will be detected by a decrease in flow. This finding will also direct the radiologist to obtain films when the maneuver is repeated. This makes it unlikely that the diagnosis will be missed. Since July 1988 a total of 1212 patients were evaluated with continuous-wave Doppler for suspected chronic ischemia. From this group 41 patients were selected to be studied again with the combined continuous-wave Doppler and duplex scanning method for possible popliteal artery entrapment syndrome. Two cases were discovered and verified by dynamic angiography guided by continuous-wave Doppler and treated surgically.\r"

Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy.\r"

After confluent growth of both cell types had been achieved, iodine 125 bound to low-density lipoprotein (10 ng protein/ml) was added to the media of the upper well. After a 3-hour incubation period, the iodine 125-bound low-density lipoprotein content of the upper and lower media demonstrated an impedance to lipoprotein movement across the endothelial cell monolayer as compared to the bare porous polycarbonate filter of the transwell (p less than 10(-6)). The presence of smooth muscle cells in the bottom well significantly enhanced the permeability of the endothelial cell layer (p less than 10(-60). This effect remained unchanged over a 9-day time course. Membrane binding and cellular uptake of low-density lipoprotein by endothelial cells was not altered by smooth muscle cells, indicating that this change in permeability could not be easily attributed to changes in receptor-mediated transport or transcytosis. Membrane binding (p less than 0.02) and cellular uptake (p less than 10(-6)) of low-density lipoprotein by smooth muscle cells in the bilayer, when adjusted for counts available in the smooth muscle cell media, were both reduced in the early incubation period as compared to isolated smooth muscle cells. The disproportionate reduction in uptake as compared to binding would suggest that this was not entirely a receptor-dependent process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "White men hired at the Oak Ridge (Tenn) National Laboratory between 1943 and 1972 were followed up for vital status through 1984 (N = 8318, 1524 deaths). Relatively low mortality compared with that in US white men was observed for most causes of death, but leukemia mortality was elevated in the total cohort (63% higher, 28 deaths) and in workers who had at some time been monitored for internal radionuclide contamination (123% higher, 16 deaths). Median cumulative dose of external penetrating radiation was 1.4 mSv; 638 workers had cumulative doses above 50 mSv (5 rem). After accounting for age, birth cohort, a measure of socioeconomic status, and active worker status, external radiation with a 20-year exposure lag was related to all causes of death (2.68% increase per 10 mSv) primarily due to an association with cancer mortality (4.94% per 10 mSv). Studies of this population through 1977 did not find radiation-cancer mortality associations, and identical analyses using the shorter follow-up showed that associations with radiation did not appear until after 1977. The radiation-cancer dose response is 10 times higher than estimates from the follow-up of survivors of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, but similar to one previous occupational study. Dose-response estimates are subject to uncertainties due to potential problems, including measurement of radiation doses and cancer outcomes. Longer-term follow-up of this and other populations with good measurement of protracted low-level exposures will be critical to evaluating the generalizability of the results reported herein.\r"

  ".W": "Reports from the United Kingdom have described increases in leukemia and lymphoma among young persons living near certain nuclear installations. Because of concerns raised by these reports, a mortality survey was conducted in populations living near nuclear facilities in the United States. All facilities began service before 1982. Over 900,000 cancer deaths occurred from 1950 through 1984 in 107 counties with or near nuclear installations. Each study county was matched for comparison to three \"control counties\" in the same region. There were 1.8 million cancer deaths in the 292 control counties during the 35 years studied. Deaths due to leukemia or other cancers were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties. For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.08, while after start-up it was 1.03. For leukemia mortality at all ages, the relative risks were 1.02 before start-up and 0.98 after. For counties in two states, cancer incidence data were also available. For one facility, the standardized registration ratio for childhood leukemia was increased significantly after start-up. However, the increase also antedated the operation of this facility. The study is limited by the correlational approach and the large size of the geographic areas (counties) used. It does not prove the absence of any effect. If, however, any excess cancer risk was present in US counties with nuclear facilities, it was too small to be detected with the methods employed.\r"

Vehicle and occupant data were combined to examine crash and injury patterns. Reported seat belt use in crashes increased after the law, and there were substantial decreases in injuries. Front seat occupants were less likely to receive medical treatment following a crash in the postlaw period. The reduction in the number of injuries was greater for passengers in the right front seat than for drivers and for frontal crashes than for other types of crashes. The injury reduction effects occurred primarily through reductions in the number of head and face injuries, particularly those that occur from contact with windshields and instrument panels.\r"

However, data from normotensive subjects are needed for interpretation of hypertensive readings. Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored in 126 normotensive subjects (age range, 20 to 84 years). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and blood pressure loads (percentage of systolic readings greater than 140 mm Hg and diastolic readings greater than 90 mm Hg) were obtained and interpreted. Mean awake systolic and diastolic pressures ranged from 125 +/- 10 to 137 +/- 17 mm Hg and 70 +/- 8 to 71 +/- 9 mm Hg, respectively. The systolic and diastolic trends of subjects' blood pressures taken during office visits and the 24-hour measurements were similar. Ranges for systolic and diastolic blood pressure loads from youngest to oldest ages were 9% +/- 14% to 25% +/- 20% and 3% +/- 7% to 4% +/- 7%, respectively. A comparison of blood pressure means from our sample that were taken during office visits and blood pressure means from a 2122-patient community survey demonstrated that our sample was reflective of an unselected population.\r"

Muscle tone in the upper and lower extremities was assessed by Ashworth scores both before the injections and every 2 hours afterward for 8 hours. Function of the upper extremities was evaluated before the injections and 4 hours afterward. Muscle tone in the lower extremities was significantly decreased within 2 hours after baclofen injection and remained lower than baseline 8 hours afterward. Upper extremity tone and function were not significantly affected by these single doses. Confusion and drowsiness occurred in two of the youngest children in the study after the 50-micrograms dose, but cleared within 2 hours. Our findings indicate that intrathecal baclofen reduces spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, as it does in adults with spasticity of spinal origin.\r"

In only one patient was the internal component lodged at the pylorus; it required endoscopic removal. Abdominal radiographs obtained in 57 patients confirmed complete elimination of internal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy components in 48 patients (84%) and identified these components in the colon in eight (14%). In two patients, the internal components were identified in the stool, and in one, radiographs were not obtained. Six patients who did not have abdominal radiographs had no problems during a mean follow-up period of 153.3 +/- 37.2 days. This simple method is safe, inexpensive, can be offered to the large majority of patients with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes, and avoids the need for endoscopic removal.\r"

By placing genes specific for highly desirable phenotypes into the DNA of plants, animals, and bacteria, farmers have increased crop and livestock survival, enhanced the nutritional quality of foods, increased industry productivity, and reduced the need for toxic pesticides and herbicides. However, introduction of genetically modified foods into the marketplace has raised a spectrum of public health issues. Physicians, as the most proximal scientific resource for most individuals, are uniquely positioned to address patient concerns regarding the safety of genetically altered foods. This report provides an overview of the inherent risks and benefits of \"agrogenetics\" and offers a series of recommendations designed to promote the education of the medical community and dispel public misconception regarding genetic manipulation.\r"

To describe the nature and frequency of blood contact and its risk factors, trained observers monitored a sample of operations performed by six surgical services at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Ga, for 6 months. In 62 (30.1%) of 206 operations, at least one blood contact was observed. Of 1828 operating room person-procedures observed, 96 (5.3%) had 147 blood contacts (133 skin contacts [90%], 10 percutaneous injuries [7%], and four eye splashes [3%]). The mean number of blood contacts per 100 person-procedures was highest for surgeons (18.6). The frequency of percutaneous injury was similar among surgeons and scrub staff (mean, 1.2 per 100 worker-procedures for each group). Risk factors for surgeons' blood contacts were (1) performing a trauma, burn, or orthopedic emergency procedure (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 8.7); (2) patient blood loss exceeding 250mL (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7); and (3) being in the operating room longer than 1 hour (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1). Of 110 blood contacts among surgeons, 81 (74%) were potentially preventable by additional barrier precautions, such as face shields and fluid-resistant gowns. Twenty-one (84%) of 25 blood contacts among surgeons in procedures in which all three risk factors were present were potentially preventable by additional barriers. Of 29 blood contacts among anesthesia and circulating personnel, 20 (69%) would have been prevented by glove use. For surgical procedures in which operating room personnel are at increased risk of blood contact, reevaluation of surgical technique, use of appropriate barrier precautions, and development of puncture-resistant glove materials are indicated.\r"

The size of the effect of ditiocarb was maintained when data were reanalyzed after exclusion of a patient who progressed to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was not strictly CDC-defined (RR, 0.46), or when considering as new opportunistic infections three events, which were clinically active at entry, but for which the definitive diagnosis was made during study (RR, 0.49). The administration of ditiocarb did not induce any major adverse clinical or biological reactions. We conclude that, in this study, ditiocarb was safe and reduced the incidence of opportunistic infections in patients with symptomatic HIV infection.\r"

We hypothesized that the diagnosis of panic disorder would mark those for whom continuing disability is most likely. We interviewed 72 such patients at the time of their normal angiogram, and then again an average of 38 months later. Those with panic disorder (n = 36) demonstrated significantly more disability at follow-up than did the other study patients. We conclude that those patients with normal angiograms who have panic disorder are more disabled than those who do not have panic disorder. Panic disorder in psychiatric samples has been shown to be highly treatable. Therefore, early identification and treatment of panic disorder in this group is likely to minimize the suffering associated with this condition.\r"

Persons who dropped out of the trials were classified as cause due to adverse cardiovascular events or other causes without knowledge of drug assignment. There were 3161 subjects who entered any randomized, double-blind phase of placebo-controlled protocols; 197 (6.2%) withdrew because of cardiovascular events. There was no difference in risk of adverse events between drug and placebo groups. A prospectively defined subgroup analysis showed that groups who received calcium antagonists were at an increased risk of dropout compared with placebo groups (P = .04), primarily because of a disproportionate number of adverse events in studies of one drug. In conclusion, there were few adverse experiences associated with short-term placebo use. Withholding active treatment does not increase the risk of serious cardiac events.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical research has long been viewed as a fragile pursuit requiring special nurturing. The full-time clinical faculty system was introduced in the early 20th century to provide a milieu that would foster clinical investigation. This article, based on extensive archival research, will show that the main goal of the architects of the full-time system was to stimulate research by removing the incentive for medical professors to devote their main energy to practice. The plan was developed by preclinical scientists at The Johns Hopkins Medical School (Baltimore, Md) and was inaugurated there in 1913 with the financial assistance of the Rockefeller General Education Board. As other medical schools adopted traditional academic criteria for appointment and advancement, there were additional incentives for faculty members to undertake research. In the 1920s, the General Education Board yielded to pressure to liberalize its definition of full time and began to support medical schools that implemented what came to be known as the \"geographic full-time plan.\" Increased government support and other factors encouraged the expansion of full-time plans and led to an impressive increase in the output of research. Today, growing pressure on full-time clinical faculty members to generate income from practice for themselves and their institutions threatens the future of clinical research in this country.\r"

Occasionally, disease may result in systemic symptoms and dissemination. Five adult patients, aged 24 to 57 years, were diagnosed as having cat-scratch disease, based on a positive history of cat scratches followed by typical symptoms including painful regional lymphadenitis, malaise, and positive cat-scratch skin tests. Diagnostic evaluations revealed no other cause for the lymphadenitis. Three patients had not received prior treatment with antibiotics, and two patients had failed to improve on other antibiotics. All five were treated with oral ciprofloxacin, 500 mg by mouth, twice daily. All patients had dramatic improvement in symptoms within a few days and none has relapsed during follow-up. This is the first report of successful treatment of cat-scratch disease with ciprofloxacin, which appears to be an effective therapy for cat-scratch disease in adults.\r"

However, lack of compliance with the prescribed regimen, excessive cost, and troublesome adverse effects of some antihypertensive agents led to the consideration of intermittent therapy or even complete discontinuation of therapy as an effective alternative to lifelong medication. Prospective studies dealing with this subject reported inconsistent results. Nevertheless, they allowed us to identify selection criteria of candidates for step-down or discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy. Such candidates include patients with mild essential hypertension who have one or more of the following characteristics: young age, normal body weight, low salt intake, no alcohol consumption, low pretreatment blood pressure, successful therapy with one drug only, and no or only minimal signs of target organ damage. Stopping antihypertensive therapy without subsequent rise in arterial pressure was shown to be possible in a subset of patients with mild essential hypertension for a period of months to years. This approach appears to be safe, provided that blood pressure is monitored frequently, and may improve compliance, save treatment costs, and reduce adverse effects of certain drugs, although its long-term consequences for morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.\r"

Although the DATTA panelists considered the procedure appropriate with respect to both its safety and effectiveness, recognition was made that there are no comparative trials of this technique vs open cholecystectomy and virtually no literature on complication rates. The Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons has developed minimal credentialing criteria for determining competence in laparoscopic surgery. This includes completion of an approved residency training in general surgery, training in laparoscopic technique either by a surgeon experienced in this procedure or by completion of an approved course in the technique requiring hands-on laboratory practice, and observation or proctoring of an actual surgical procedure. Many of the DATTA panelists (35 of 40 [87.5%]) reiterated the importance of requiring that the procedure be performed first with animals and that subsequent laparoscopic procedures on patients be done under the supervision of an expert in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1977, 119 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer have undergone combined modality therapy including surgery at our institution. Seventy-nine patients (58 male, 21 female; median age 63 years) had surgery first, and 67 of these had adjuvant chemotherapy. Forty (27 male, 13 female; median age 59 years) had chemotherapy first, and 94% had a complete or partial response before the operation. Pretreatment staging revealed 69 stage I, 27 stage II, and 23 stage III tumors. Twenty-six patients required pneumonectomy, 88 lobectomy, and five had no resection. Four patients had gross and six had microscopic residual disease. Postoperative pathologic examination showed small-cell lung cancer only (n = 95), non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 3), mixed (n = 17), and no residual tumor (n = 4). Postoperative staging revealed 35 stage I, 36 stage II, and 48 stage IIIa tumors. The median survival of the entire group is 111 weeks and the projected 5-year survival rate is 39%. No survival difference was seen between patients treated with chemotherapy before the operation and those undergoing an initial operation followed by chemotherapy (p = 0.756). The median survival for patients with pathologic stage I disease has not been reached, and the projected 5-year survival rate is 51%. This is significantly better than for the patients with stage II (median 82 weeks, p = 0.001) or stage III (median 83 weeks, p = 0.001) disease, who have projected 5-year survival rates of 28% and 19%, respectively. Seven of the 12 patients who had no adjuvant chemotherapy remain alive at 6 to 48+ months. Sixty-seven patients have died (11 had no evidence of disease). Only 10 patients had a relapse in the primary site alone, seven at the primary and distant sites, and 39 only in distant sites. In summary, resection improves control at the primary site, and a significant proportion of patients with stage I (N0) disease achieve long-term survival and cure with combined modality therapy including surgery. Stage II and IIIa patients have survival predictions similar to stage IIIa non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated surgically.\r"

We conducted a prospective, randomized, blinded study of 50 consecutive patients to compare postoperative pain, pulmonary function, shoulder strength, and range of shoulder motion between the standard posterolateral and the muscle sparing thoracotomy techniques. Pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity), shoulder strength, and range of motion were measured preoperatively and at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively. Pain was quantitated by postoperative narcotic requirements, the visual analogue scale, and the McGill pain questionnaire. Morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay were compared between the standard posterolateral and muscle-sparing techniques. There were no differences in postoperative pulmonary function, shoulder range of motion, extent of lung resection, surgical approach time, mortality, or hospital stay. There was significantly less postoperative pain in the muscle-sparing group. The narcotic requirement was less in the first 24 hours (p = 0.0169), and visual analogue scale scores were significantly lower (p less than 0.05) throughout the first postoperative week. Shoulder girdle strength was decreased at 1 week in the standard incision group whereas the strength was preserved with the muscle-sparing approach. Muscle strength had returned to preoperative levels by 1 month in both groups. Morbidity was identical in the two groups with the exception of postoperative seromas. The prevalence of seroma was 23% in the muscle-sparing group and 0% in the standard incision group (p = 0.0125). We have demonstrated that the muscle-sparing incision may be a reasonable alternative to the standard posterolateral approach.\r"

  ".W": "Computerized mapping of atrial fibrillation was performed in animals and man. To study atrial fibrillation in a systematic manner, we developed a clinically relevant experimental model of atrial fibrillation. Chronic mitral regurgitation was created surgically in 25 dogs without opening the pericardium. After several months of chronic mitral regurgitation, the atria became enlarged and sustained atrial fibrillation could be induced by standard programmed electrical stimulation techniques. Computerized isochronous activation maps of the atria were recorded during atrial fibrillation from 208 bipolar electrodes simultaneously. In a parallel study, human atrial fibrillation was mapped with a separate 160-channel intraoperative mapping system in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who were undergoing surgical correction of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The canine activation sequence maps demonstrated a spectrum of rhythm abnormalities ranging from simple atrial flutter to complex atrial fibrillation. They also showed that macroreentrant circuits within the atrial myocardium were responsible for the entire spectrum of arrhythmias. Atrial reentry was also documented during human atrial fibrillation. All patients had nonuniform conduction around regions of bidirectional block in both atria resulting in multiple discrete wave fronts. In addition, six patients had a single reentrant circuit in the right atrium in which bidirectional block of the activation wave front occurred along the sulcus terminals between the venae cavae. The left atrium in all patients demonstrated multiple wave fronts and conduction block, but left atrial reentry could not be detected. Both the experimental study and the clinical study demonstrated that multiple wave fronts, nonuniform conduction, bidirectional block, and large (macroreentrant) reentrant circuits occur during atrial fibrillation. The presence of macroreentrant circuits and the absence of either microreentrant circuits or evidence of atrial automaticity suggests that atrial fibrillation should be amenable to surgical ablation.\r"

An international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 2.99 was assigned to group A and 3.0 to 4.5 to group B; both groups were subsequently analyzed for thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. Final evaluation included 51 and 48 patients, respectively. The follow-up was 626 months for group A (12.3 months/patient) and 486 months for group B (10.1 months/patient). The frequency of thromboembolism was equal in both groups: one transient ischemic attack in group A (a rate of 1.92/100 patient-years) and two transient ischemic attacks in group B (a rate of 4.94/100 patient-years). There was, however, a statistical difference in bleeding complications between the two groups (p less than 0.02). Two patients bled in group A, a rate of 3.9% (3.8/100 patient-years), which represents an incidence of one episode each 25.6 years of treatment; 10 patients bled in group B, a rate of 20.8% (24.7/100 patient-years) representing an incidence of one episode each 4 years of treatment. We conclude that an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 is safer than a ratio of 3 to 4.5 and confers good protection from thromboembolism when oral anticoagulant therapy is used conjointly with platelet function-inhibiting drugs in patients with mechanical substitute heart valves.\r"

Patients in whom the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due primarily to increased left atrial pressure (\"reactive\") frequently have normalization of resistance after transplantation, but few studies have detailed the time course and magnitude of these changes. To analyze the response of pulmonary vascular resistance to cardiac transplantation, we analyzed data from 4353 right heart catheterizations on all 182 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation between 1981 and Jan. 1, 1990. Before transplantation 18% of patients had a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 WU, 16% had a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 60 mm Hg, and 16% had a transpulmonary gradient greater than 14 mm Hg. In the overall group of patients, pulmonary vascular resistance (mean value 2.63 WU), transpulmonary gradient (mean value 9.9 mm Hg), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (mean value 48.0 mm Hg) were normalized within 1 week of cardiac transplantation. In patients with a high preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than or equal to 4 WU), the resistance fell promptly within 1 week of transplantation but continued to be slightly elevated throughout the period of follow-up. By multiple regression analysis, pulmonary vascular resistance at 1 week and 1 year after transplantation was significantly correlated with the pretransplantation resistance. Pulmonary vascular resistance anytime after transplantation was related to preoperative resistance, body surface area, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Inferences: (1) As a group, cardiac transplant recipients have a normal pulmonary vascular resistance, transpulmonary gradient, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure within 1 week after transplantation with little change thereafter for at least several years. (2) Patients with reversible elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance before cardiac transplantation typically have a reactive and a fixed component. Cardiac transplantation relieves the reactive but not the fixed component. As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance early (within 1 week) and late after transplantation will have fallen but not completely normalized.\r"

  ".W": "Rejection of the cardiac allograft is often associated with reversible myocardial failure, the mechanism of which is not understood. We have examined this phenomenon in a small animal model that provides the opportunity for multimodality study of the rejection process. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in the Lewis rat with Lewis X Brown-Norway (allografts) or Lewis (isografts) donors. Without immunosuppression, allografts are completely rejected in 6 to 8 days. At 3 days cardiac grafts were explanted and mounted on a modified Langendorff apparatus for functional measurements or submitted for pathologic examination and biochemical determination of high-energy phosphates. Three-day isografts (n = 9) had minimal histologic changes. Pathologic examination of 3-day allografts (n = 13) showed lymphocytic infiltrate and myocyte necrosis, histologic features for which antirejection treatment is usually given clinically. For grafts subjected to functional studies (n = 11), heart rate, cardiac output, coronary flow, and stroke work were determined at baseline and in response to isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) mol/ml). Three-day allografts (n = 6) and isografts (n = 5) had similar baseline function. The chronotropic response to isoproterenol was similar in allografts and isografts, but allografts had diminished cardiac output and stroke work after isoproterenol. Adenosine triphosphate levels were normal (41.9 nmol/mg) in 3-day allografts (n = 4). We have evaluated functional, biochemical, and pathologic changes associated with myocardial dysfunction during heterotopic cardiac transplant rejection in a small animal. This model reproducibly demonstrates diminished contractile reserve in 3-day allografts with normal baseline function and high-energy stores but histologically significant rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was instituted in 11 patients in cardiac arrest refractory to conventional resuscitation measures. Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was used in five patients in whom cardiac arrest occurred as a result of a complication in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (group 1) and in six other patients in cardiac arrest (group II). A 21F cannula and a 17F cannula were percutaneously inserted into the femoral vein and artery. Flow rates of 3 to 5 L/min were achieved with restoration of mean arterial pressure to 70 mm Hg (range 50 to 75). The status of all 11 patients was improved initially both clinically and hemodynamically with percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. Of the group II patients, three had anatomy unsuitable for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass grafting, could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary support, and died; three of these patients had coronary artery bypass grafting and two survived. All five group I patients underwent successful coronary bypass grafting and survived. Of the seven patients with anatomically correctable disease, all seven were discharged from the hospital. With conventional management nearly all seven of these patients would have died. Nine of 11 patients underwent a cardiac operation and seven of the nine survived. The operative mortality rate was 22% and the overall survival rate was 64%. At follow-up (mean 7 months), all seven patients are alive and six have resumed a normal and active life-style. In conclusion, emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support is a powerful resuscitative tool that may stabilize the condition of patients in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest to allow for definitive intervention.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests whether simulated thrombolysis before controlled reperfusion (i.e., simulated coronary artery bypass) causes reperfusion injury that obviates the benefits of subsequent controlled reperfusion and results in unnecessary ventricular arrhythmias. Fifteen dogs underwent acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In 10 dogs we simulated thrombolysis after 1 hour of ischemia (delivering 10% to 15% of control flow at 5 ml/min), followed 1 hour later by either normal blood reperfusion at systemic pressure (to simulate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) in five dogs or regionally controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass in five others to simulate coronary bypass. In five dogs ischemia was prolonged to 2 hours, and the initial reperfusate was blood cardioplegic solution on total vented bypass (to simulate primary coronary bypass). All hearts receiving simulated thrombolysis (100%) after 1 hour of ischemia had reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation. All hearts treated by simulated angioplasty recovered regional contractility (56% of control systolic shortening), whereas there was no (0%) recovery of spontaneous contractility after subsequent blood cardioplegic reperfusion, and only two (40%) dogs had contractile reserve capacity (6% +/- 49%). Conversely, surgically controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion without preceding low-flow normal blood reperfusion after 2 hours of ischemia resulted in no ventricular arrhythmias (0%; p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis), 72% +/- 7% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of regional contractility (ultrasonic crystals), and 114% +/- 11% (p less than 0.05 versus simulated coronary artery bypass after simulated thrombolysis) recovery of contractile reserve with calcium chloride stimulation. We conclude that controlled reperfusion (simulating coronary artery bypass) with blood cardioplegic solution produces immediate functional recovery and avoids the ventricular fibrillation that follows simulated thrombolysis despite the need for prolonged ischemic time. Preceding controlled reperfusion by normal blood reperfusion (simulated thrombolysis) shortens the ischemic time but nullifies immediate functional recovery possible by simulated coronary bypass and produces unnecessary arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The susceptibilities of atria and ventricles to cold preservation were studied in rat hearts. Rat hearts were stored in Collins' solution at 4 degrees C for 0, 12, or 24 hours, and the atrial and ventricular function was measured in a working heart model and in isolated atrial and papillary muscle preparations. In working heart preparations, cardiac output decreased to 0 ml/min and other parameters of ventricular function (systolic and end-diastolic pressure and dP/dt of the left ventricle) markedly deteriorated after 12 hours of preservation. After 24 hours, no contraction of the left ventricle was observed despite the presence of atrial contraction. In isolated atrial muscle preparations, the rate of spontaneous beating of the right atrium was not affected by cold preservation. The twitch contractions of right and left atria were attenuated but elicited after 24 hours. In electrically driven papillary muscles, twitch contractions were also markedly attenuated by 12 hours of preservation and were abolished after 24 hours. The positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol was also markedly attenuated in the atrial preparations by cold preservation. However, the positive chronotropic response to isoproterenol and the negative chronotropic and inotropic responses to carbachol were little affected by cold preservation. Intramural cholinergic and adrenergic nerve stimulation produced first negative and then positive effects on the beating rate and twitch contraction in the isolated right atria. Cold preservation selectively attenuated and finally abolished the adrenergic responses. In the ventricles, the adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate content significantly decreased and the lactate content increased with an increase in the preservation period. On the other hand, changes of such metabolites in the atria were either not observed or were much smaller. These results suggest that atrial function is maintained better than ventricular function in the cold-preserved heart.\r"

  ".U": "91155409\r", 
  ".W": "Many cardiac surgical units now use a microfilter in the infusion line for delivery of crystalloid cardioplegic solution to protect against the potential hazards of particulate contamination of cardioplegic solution. The aim of this group of studies was to determine the effects of particulate contamination of cardioplegic solutions, in order to establish whether a microfilter is needed in the infusion line. Total particle counts performed on two commercial cardioplegic solutions were low, but there were sufficient particles greater than 10 microns in diameter to cause coronary vasoconstriction. In isolated rat hearts a 20-minute infusion of St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution produced a progressive reduction in coronary flow, which was not prevented by the inclusion of a 0.8 micron filter in the infusion line. Two studies were performed on canine hearts to determine the effects of unfiltered cardioplegic solution on coronary vascular resistance. In the first, cardioplegic solution at 20 degrees C was infused for 20 minutes at a constant pressure of 50 mm Hg and flow rate was measured. In the second, the same solution at 4 degrees C was infused at a constant flow rate for 2 1/2 minutes and the infusion pressure was measured. In neither study did coronary vascular resistance rise. A final clinical study involving patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery compared the effects on coronary resistance of infusion at a constant flow of filtered versus unfiltered cardioplegic solution (n = 10 in each group). There was a similar rise in coronary perfusion pressure in both groups during the infusion. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence of particle-induced coronary vasoconstriction to justify the expense of a microfilter in the cardioplegic infusion line.\r"

For example, in the three major trials of bypass grafting for stable angina, crossover rates from medical to surgical therapy were approximately 25% at 5 years. For this reason, the classic intent-to-treat analyses have been criticized for their inability to evaluate the \"true\" effect of treatment. In this article we emphasize the concept of \"initial treatment\" as it applies to intent-to-treat analyses and examine four proposed alternative methods of analysis based on adherence with survival data from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study to illustrate the concepts. The alternative methods include (1) censoring crossovers when treatment changes, (2) transferring crossovers from the original to the new treatment group when treatment changes, (3) excluding all crossovers from analysis, and (4) counting crossovers from the date of randomization in the treatment ultimately received group. We point out the biases attendant on analyses based on adherence and reaffirm the validity of intent-to-treat analysis.\r"

The surgical team disciplined itself to divide presternal soft tissues with a scalpel and used electrocautery for pinpoint hemostasis only. This 0.16% infection rate was statistically significantly lower than those in 28 previously published studies (Pearson's chi 2 test, p less than 0.05). Twenty-four predisposing factors were evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Among these only an operating time longer than 3 hours is related to sternotomy infections (p = 0.0208), and this effect was not a strong one. Statistical evidence strongly suggests that discriminate use of electrocautery is a major reason for the lowest median sternotomy infection rate reported to date.\r"

There were 28 men and 15 women whose mean age was 55 years, range 21 to 76. Three fourths of the patients were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Replacement of primary chordae tendineae of the anterior leaflet was performed with 4-0 or 5-0 polytetrafluoroethylene sutures. A double-armed suture was passed twice through the fibrous portion of the papillary muscle head and tied down. Each arm of the suture was brought up to the free margin of the leaflet and passed through the area where the native chorda was attached. After the lengths of the two arms were adjusted, the ends were tied together on the ventricular side of the leaflet. Thirty patients had degenerative disease of the mitral valve; the incompetence was due to prolapse of the anterior leaflet in 14 patients and prolapse of the anterior and posterior leaflets in 16. Eleven patients had rheumatic mitral valve disease: four had stenosis, three had regurgitation, and four had mixed lesions. Two patients had ischemic mitral regurgitation caused by rupture of a papillary muscle head. There were no operative deaths. Patients have been followed up from 5 to 61 months, mean 13. Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed at regular intervals after the operation and revealed normal mitral valve function in most patients There were two failures that necessitated mitral valve replacement: one because of acute mitral regurgitation and the other because of hemolysis. There have been two late deaths, neither one valve related. Replacement of chordae tendineae with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures is simple and allows for reconstruction of the mitral valve in many patients who would otherwise require mitral valve replacement. Because our patients have been followed up for a limited time, the long-term results of this procedure remain unknown.\r"

The three solutions were a physiologic saline with pyruvate as the substrate and 4% alcohol to arrest the heart (group 1), a standard cardioplegic solution (group 2), and an alcohol-free physiologic saline with pyruvate as the substrate (group 3). Recovery in terms of rate/pressure product and oxygen consumption after 30 minutes of reperfusion was 81% and 93%, respectively, for group 1, 13% and 32% for group 2, and 70% and 72% for group 3. Percent of physiologic recovery was not related to recovery of adenosine triphosphate. The adenosine triphosphate level returned to approximately 40% control level in all three groups, and in all three groups inorganic phosphate remained approximately 320% over control level after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Phosphocreatine level significantly higher in groups 1 and 3 than in group 2, as a result of improved oxygen consumption. Intracellular pH, determined by phosphorous 31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was physiologic in groups 1 and 3 but alkaline in group 2. This alkalinity may have been caused by leaky membranes. Pyruvate helped preserve mitochondrial function during depressed oxygen delivery, such as was seen during the 24-hour storage period. Four percent alcohol arrested the heart; combined with pyruvate plus alcohol solution were better than a standard cardioplegic solution for maintaining functional capability.\r"

  ".U": "91155415\r", 
  ".W": "It has been suggested that antegrade cardioplegia with coronary sinus occlusion improves homogeneous myocardial cooling and reduces myocardial injury in the presence of coronary artery occlusion. Little data are available on the exact relationships among the basic elements or this intervention, including antegrade infusion rate, aortic root pressure, the degree of coronary sinus occlusion, coronary sinus pressure, and myocardial cooling. The purpose of this study was to determine these relationships and to provide some basic guidelines for better understanding of this intervention. Twenty-two sheep were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the distal left anterior descending artery was occluded, and the proximal coronary sinus was snared. Sixteen combinations of infusion rate (3, 5, 7, or 9 ml/kg/min) and coronary sinus occlusion (total, subtotal, or moderate occlusion or no occlusion) were adopted for each 2 minutes of antegrade cardioplegia, yielding 96 measurements. Myocardial temperatures in the occluded and nonoccluded regions, aortic root infusion pressure, and coronary sinus pressure were measured during each infusion of cardioplegic solution. Coronary sinus occlusion was then released, and the whole heart was reperfused for 30 minutes for another infusion of cardioplegic solution and measurements. Results showed good degrees of linearity between infusion rate and aortic root infusion pressure for all coronary sinus occlusion and noninfusion groups (p less than 0.01). A positive effect of coronary sinus occlusion on aortic root infusion pressure was observed. The graded increases in infusion rate with various degrees of coronary sinus occlusion were constantly associated with elevation of coronary sinus pressure (p less than 0.01). It was also noted that myocardial temperatures in the region of the occluded left anterior descending artery were significantly lower in coronary sinus occlusion groups than in nonocclusion groups (p less than 0.01 or 0.05). Myocardial temperature in the nonoccluded region decreased significantly with the stepwise increases in infusion rate (p less than 0.01), but not with the increases in coronary sinus occlusion (not significant). Based on this and previous studies, we recommend that the induced coronary sinus pressure be safely maintained in the range of 25 to 35 mm Hg and that further studies be focused on the infusion rate of 5 ml/kg/min with subtotal or total coronary sinus occlusion for the intervention of antegrade cardioplegia plus coronary sinus occlusion.\r"

  ".W": "To establish noninvasive criteria by which to manage infants with critical aortic stenosis, we examined 20 heart specimens from infants under 3 months of age and reviewed the clinical course and real time echocardiograms of 20 patients in the same age group. All 20 infants underwent open valvotomy, and in five cases both echocardiographic and postmortem measurements were available for the same heart. The anatomic specimens showed a spectrum of valvular, ventricular, and vascular abnormalities that could be accurately identified by echocardiography. A small left ventricular cavity was usually associated with a narrow ventriculoarterial junction, small ascending aorta, and narrow subaortic region. In these hearts, the mitral valve had a single or grossly hypoplastic papillary muscle with short or \"arcuate\" tendinous cords. A dilated left ventricular cavity had wider inflow and outflow orifices, and the tension apparatus of the mitral valve was either normal or supported by hypertrophic papillary muscles, at the other end of the spectrum. The survivors (n = 15) and nonsurvivors (n = 5) of open valvotomy showed significant differences in the echocardiographic dimensions of the left ventricle (p less than 0.005), the subaortic region (p less than 0.05), the ventriculoaortic junction (p less than 0.05), the ascending aorta (p less than 0.005), and the mitral valve orifice (p less than 0.001). Moreover, the papillary muscle of the mitral valve was invariably single or hypoplastic with short tendinous cords in the early nonsurvivors. Infants with unfavorable cardiac anatomy tended to present earlier (p less than 0.05) and to have a lower systemic blood pressure (p less than 0.05), and they required prostaglandin E2 to maintain right ventricular support of the circulation through a persistent arterial duct. This study suggests that patients with a small left ventricle (echocardiographic inflow dimension less than 25 mm), a narrow ventriculoaortic junction (less than 5 mm), and a small mitral valve orifice (less than 9 mm) will not achieve a satisfactory surgical result from aortic valvotomy. Such patients should be considered for cardiac transplantation or the Norwood-type of palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.\r"

Lymph nodes are easily identified, and their size, shape, margin, and internal structure can be assessed. This provides an alternative method of preoperative (clinical) evaluation of the primary tumor [T] and the regional lymph nodes [N] of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. Esophageal ultrasound was attempted in the clinical staging of 28 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. Six patients (21%) were not assessed because of the inability to pass the esophageal ultrasound probe through the malignant stricture. The staging system for carcinoma of the esophagus developed by the International Union Against Cancer and the American Joint Committee on Cancer was used. Twenty-two patients had the true T determined by pathologic review of the resected esophagus. Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified T in 13 patients (59% accuracy). In four patients (18%) the disease was overstaged by esophageal ultrasound; all these patients had early T1 tumors confined to the submucosa. In five patients (23%) the disease was understaged by esophageal ultrasound; all of these patients had advanced tumors (four T3 and one T4) that invaded beyond the esophageal wall. Seven of the nine incorrect esophageal ultrasound determinations were called T2 (three T1, three T3, one T4), which suggests that the borders of the muscularis propria require careful attention when evaluated by esophageal ultrasound. Twenty patients had the true N determined by pathologic review of the resected specimen. Esophageal ultrasound correctly identified N in 14 patients (70% accuracy). Three patients were falsely identified as having N1 disease and three were falsely identified as having N0 disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for N assessment by esophageal ultrasound were 70%. Esophageal ultrasound provides an alternative method of visualization of the esophageal wall and regional lymph nodes. Our early experience shows promise for esophageal ultrasound in the clinical staging of carcinoma of the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "Seventeen consecutive patients undergoing 20 planned aortic valve replacements with allograft valves at Stanford University Medical Center were studied with intraoperative epicardial echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping before and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Native aortic valves were replaced in 12 of the 20 patients, and eight patients underwent second aortic valve procedures. In 17 of 20 patients allograft selection was guided by prebypass echocardiographic estimates of annular diameter and/or length of allograft aortic root required. Other prebypass findings included unanticipated severe mitral regurgitation in one patient (which precluded allograft aortic valve replacement), left-to-right shunts in five patients, ascending aortic dissection in one, and aortic root disease necessitating coronary reimplantation or bypass in two. Postbypass echocardiography demonstrated acceptable competency of 18 of 19 allograft valves (mild or no aortic insufficiency). Postbypass echocardiography also documented successful repair of four of five shunts and mild mitral regurgitation in 15 of 19 patients (versus 11 of 19 before bypass). Conclusions: Intraoperative echocardiography-Doppler mapping is a useful adjunct for allograft aortic valve or aortic root replacement; it allows confident selection of appropriate tissue size before aortic cross clamping, which minimizes delay from allograft thawing procedures. It also provides helpful information about the extent of aortic root disease and coronary ostial anatomy before bypass, confirms allograft competency after bypass, and detects accompanying valvular and other hemodynamic lesions before and after allograft valve replacement.\r"

  ".U": "91155511\r", 
  ".W": "In Africa, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), which is also known as tropical splenomegaly syndrome, can be associated with a prominent lymphocytosis in blood and bone marrow that is difficult to distinguish clinically from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The observation that some patients with HMS become resistant to treatment with anti-malarial drugs has led to the suggestion that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. To test this hypothesis, 22 Ghanaian patients with HMS and/or lymphocytosis were categorised by degree of response to proguanil according to standard clinical criteria, and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and screened for rearrangements of the Jh region of the immunoglobulin gene with a DNA probe. Clonal rearrangements of the Jh region were found in all 3 patients with no response, in none of 13 patients with sustained response, and in 2 of 6 patients with moderate response or relapse on proguanil therapy. The detection of such rearrangements, and hence clonal lymphoproliferation in individuals with clinical features intermediate between HMS and CLL, supports the hypothesis that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term zidovudine therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause a destructive mitochondrial myopathy with histological features of ragged-red fibres (RRF) and proliferation of abnormal mitochondria. In 9 zidovudine-treated patients with this myopathy we found severely reduced amounts (up to 78% reduction vs normal adult controls) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle biopsy specimens by means of Southern blotting. In 2 HIV-positive patients who had not received zidovudine, muscle mtDNA content did not differ from that in the 4 controls. Depletion of mtDNA seems to be reversible, since 1 patient showed a substantial reduction in RRF and a concomitant pronounced increase in muscle mtDNA content after zidovudine therapy was discontinued. Depletion of muscle mtDNA is probably due to zidovudine-induced inhibition of mtDNA replication by DNA polymerase gamma and is not a secondary effect of HIV infection.\r"

The technique is based on peak-to-peak measurements of fast background electroencephalographic activity during a visual evoked potential (VEP) study. VEP latencies and amplitudes did not differ significantly, and showed substantial overlap, between a group of eight migraine patients and ten age-matched healthy controls. We could not recognise previously described fast activity or measure it objectively by peak-to-peak measurements. We cannot confirm that measurement of fast wave activity in the VEP background is useful in diagnosis of migraine.\r"

Parasitaemia (mean clearance time 2.7 days) and symptoms were rapidly abolished and improvement was maintained during follow-up for 14 days. Co-trimoxazole may be an effective single treatment for febrile illness in young children in areas where malaria is endemic, resources are few, and diagnosis must rely on clinical findings alone.\r"
